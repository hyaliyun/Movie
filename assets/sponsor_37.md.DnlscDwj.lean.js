In algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, the Zariski topology is a topology on algebraic varieties, introduced primarily by Oscar Zariski and later generalized for making the set of prime ideals of a commutative ring a topological space, called the spectrum of the ring. The Zariski topology allows tools from topology to be used to study algebraic varieties, even when the underlying field is not a topological field. This is one of the basic ideas of scheme theory, which allows one to build general algebraic varieties by gluing together affine varieties in a way similar to that in manifold theory, where manifolds are built by gluing together charts, which are open subsets of real affine spaces. The Zariski topology of an algebraic variety is the topology whose closed sets are the algebraic subsets of the variety. In the case of an algebraic variety over the complex numbers, the Zariski topology is thus coarser than the usual topology, as every algebraic set is closed for the usual topology. The generalization of the Zariski topology to the set of prime ideals of a commutative ring follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, that establishes a bijective correspondence between the points of an affine variety defined over an algebraically closed field and the maximal ideals of the ring of its regular functions. This suggests defining the Zariski topology on the set of the maximal ideals of a commutative ring as the topology such that a set of maximal ideals is closed if and only if it is the set of all maximal ideals that contain a given ideal. Another basic idea of Grothendieck's scheme theory is to consider as points, not only the usual points corresponding to maximal ideals, but also all (irreducible) algebraic varieties, which correspond to prime ideals. Thus the Zariski topology on the set of prime ideals (spectrum) of a commutative ring is the topology such that a set of prime ideals is closed if and only if it is the set of all prime ideals that contain a fixed ideal. Zariski topology of varieties In classical algebraic geometry (that is, the part of algebraic geometry in which one does not use schemes, which were introduced by Grothendieck around 1960), the Zariski topology is defined on algebraic varieties. The Zariski topology, defined on the points of the variety, is the topology such that the closed sets are the algebraic subsets of the variety. As the most elementary algebraic varieties are affine and projective varieties, it is useful to make this definition more explicit in both cases. We assume that we are working over a fixed, algebraically closed field k (in classical geometry k is almost always the complex numbers). =Affine varieties= First we define the topology on affine spaces \\\\mathbb{A}^n, which as sets are just n-dimensional vector spaces over k. The topology is defined by specifying its closed sets, rather than its open sets, and these are taken simply to be all the algebraic sets in \\\\mathbb{A}^n. That is, the closed sets are those of the form :V(S) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{A}^n \\\\mid f(x) = 0, \\\\forall f \\\\in S\\\\\\\\} where S is any set of polynomials in n variables over k. It is a straightforward verification to show that: * V(S) = V((S)), where (S) is the ideal generated by the elements of S; * For any two ideals of polynomials I, J, we have *# V(I) \\\\cup V(J)\\\\,=\\\\,V(IJ); *# V(I) \\\\cap V(J)\\\\,=\\\\,V(I + J). It follows that finite unions and arbitrary intersections of the sets V(S) are also of this form, so that these sets form the closed sets of a topology (equivalently, their complements, denoted D(S) and called principal open sets, form the topology itself). This is the Zariski topology on \\\\mathbb{A}^n. If X is an affine algebraic set (irreducible or not) then the Zariski topology on it is defined simply to be the subspace topology induced by its inclusion into some \\\\mathbb{A}^n. Equivalently, it can be checked that: * The elements of the affine coordinate ring ::A(X)\\\\,=\\\\,k[x_1, \\\\dots, x_n]/I(X) act as functions on X just as the elements of k[x_1, \\\\dots, x_n] act as functions on \\\\mathbb{A}^n; * For any set of polynomials S, let T be the set of their images in A(X). Then the subset of X ::V'(T) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X \\\\mid f(x) = 0, \\\\forall f \\\\in T\\\\\\\\} (these notations are not standard) is equal to the intersection with X of V(S). This establishes that the above equation, clearly a generalization of the previous one, defines the Zariski topology on any affine variety. =Projective varieties= Recall that n-dimensional projective space \\\\mathbb{P}^n is defined to be the set of equivalence classes of non-zero points in \\\\mathbb{A}^{n + 1} by identifying two points that differ by a scalar multiple in k. The elements of the polynomial ring k[x_0, \\\\dots, x_n] are not functions on \\\\mathbb{P}^n because any point has many representatives that yield different values in a polynomial; however, for homogeneous polynomials the condition of having zero or nonzero value on any given projective point is well-defined since the scalar multiple factors out of the polynomial. Therefore if S is any set of homogeneous polynomials we may reasonably speak of :V(S) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}^n \\\\mid f(x) = 0, \\\\forall f \\\\in S\\\\\\\\}. The same facts as above may be established for these sets, except that the word \\"ideal\\" must be replaced by the phrase \\"homogeneous ideal\\", so that the V(S), for sets S of homogeneous polynomials, define a topology on \\\\mathbb{P}^n. As above the complements of these sets are denoted D(S), or, if confusion is likely to result, D‚Ä≤(S). The projective Zariski topology is defined for projective algebraic sets just as the affine one is defined for affine algebraic sets, by taking the subspace topology. Similarly, it may be shown that this topology is defined intrinsically by sets of elements of the projective coordinate ring, by the same formula as above. =Properties= A very useful fact about these topologies is that we may exhibit a basis for them consisting of particularly simple elements, namely the D(f) for individual polynomials (or for projective varieties, homogeneous polynomials) f. Indeed, that these form a basis follows from the formula for the intersection of two Zariski-closed sets given above (apply it repeatedly to the principal ideals generated by the generators of (S)). These are called distinguished or basic open sets. By Hilbert's basis theorem and some elementary properties of Noetherian rings, every affine or projective coordinate ring is Noetherian. As a consequence, affine or projective spaces with the Zariski topology are Noetherian topological spaces, which implies that any closed subset of these spaces is compact. However, unless for finite algebraic sets, no algebraic set is ever a Hausdorff space. In the old topological literature \\"compact\\" was taken to include the Hausdorff property, and this convention is still honored in algebraic geometry; therefore compactness in the modern sense is called \\"quasicompactness\\" in algebraic geometry. However, since every point (a1, ..., an) is the zero set of the polynomials x1 \\\\- a1, ..., xn \\\\- an, points are closed and so every variety satisfies the T1 axiom. Every regular map of varieties is continuous in the Zariski topology. In fact, the Zariski topology is the weakest topology (with the fewest open sets) in which this is true and in which points are closed. This is easily verified by noting that the Zariski-closed sets are simply the intersections of the inverse images of 0 by the polynomial functions, considered as regular maps into \\\\mathbb{A}^1. Spectrum of a ring In modern algebraic geometry, an algebraic variety is often represented by its associated scheme, which is a topological space (equipped with additional structures) that is locally homeomorphic to the spectrum of a ring. The spectrum of a commutative ring A, denoted , is the set of the prime ideals of A, equipped with the Zariski topology, for which the closed sets are the sets :V(I) = \\\\\\\\{P \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Spec}\\\\,(A) \\\\mid I \\\\subseteq P\\\\\\\\} where I is an ideal. To see the connection with the classical picture, note that for any set S of polynomials (over an algebraically closed field), it follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz that the points of V(S) (in the old sense) are exactly the tuples (a1, ..., an) such that the ideal generated by the polynomials x1 \\\\- a1, ..., xn \\\\- an contains S; moreover, these are maximal ideals and by the \\"weak\\" Nullstellensatz, an ideal of any affine coordinate ring is maximal if and only if it is of this form. Thus, V(S) is \\"the same as\\" the maximal ideals containing S. Grothendieck's innovation in defining Spec was to replace maximal ideals with all prime ideals; in this formulation it is natural to simply generalize this observation to the definition of a closed set in the spectrum of a ring. Another way, perhaps more similar to the original, to interpret the modern definition is to realize that the elements of A can actually be thought of as functions on the prime ideals of A; namely, as functions on Spec A. Simply, any prime ideal P has a corresponding residue field, which is the field of fractions of the quotient A/P, and any element of A has a reflection in this residue field. Furthermore, the elements that are actually in P are precisely those whose reflection vanishes at P. So if we think of the map, associated to any element a of A: :e_a \\\\colon \\\\bigl(P \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A)\\\\bigr) \\\\mapsto \\\\left(\\\\frac{a \\\\; \\\\bmod P}{1} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Frac}(A/P)\\\\right) (\\"evaluation of a\\"), which assigns to each point its reflection in the residue field there, as a function on Spec A (whose values, admittedly, lie in different fields at different points), then we have :e_a(P)=0 \\\\Leftrightarrow P\\\\in V(a) More generally, V(I) for any ideal I is the common set on which all the \\"functions\\" in I vanish, which is formally similar to the classical definition. In fact, they agree in the sense that when A is the ring of polynomials over some algebraically closed field k, the maximal ideals of A are (as discussed in the previous paragraph) identified with n-tuples of elements of k, their residue fields are just k, and the \\"evaluation\\" maps are actually evaluation of polynomials at the corresponding n-tuples. Since as shown above, the classical definition is essentially the modern definition with only maximal ideals considered, this shows that the interpretation of the modern definition as \\"zero sets of functions\\" agrees with the classical definition where they both make sense. Just as Spec replaces affine varieties, the Proj construction replaces projective varieties in modern algebraic geometry. Just as in the classical case, to move from the affine to the projective definition we need only replace \\"ideal\\" by \\"homogeneous ideal\\", though there is a complication involving the \\"irrelevant maximal ideal,\\" which is discussed in the cited article. =Examples= right * Spec k, the spectrum of a field k is the topological space with one element. * Spec ‚Ñ§, the spectrum of the integers has a closed point for every prime number p corresponding to the maximal ideal (p) ‚äÇ ‚Ñ§, and one non-closed generic point (i.e., whose closure is the whole space) corresponding to the zero ideal (0). So the closed subsets of Spec ‚Ñ§ are precisely the whole space and the finite unions of closed points. * Spec k[t], the spectrum of the polynomial ring over a field k: such a polynomial ring is known to be a principal ideal domain and the irreducible polynomials are the prime elements of k[t]. If k is algebraically closed, for example the field of complex numbers, a non-constant polynomial is irreducible if and only if it is linear, of the form t ‚àí a, for some element a of k. So, the spectrum consists of one closed point for every element a of k and a generic point, corresponding to the zero ideal, and the set of the closed points is homeomorphic with the affine line k equipped with its Zariski topology. Because of this homeomorphism, some authors call affine line the spectrum of k[t]. If k is not algebraically closed, for example the field of the real numbers, the picture becomes more complicated because of the existence of non- linear irreducible polynomials. For example, the spectrum of ‚Ñù[t] consists of the closed points (x ‚àí a), for a in ‚Ñù, the closed points (x2 \\\\+ px + q) where p, q are in ‚Ñù and with negative discriminant p2 ‚àí 4q < 0, and finally a generic point (0). For any field, the closed subsets of Spec k[t] are finite unions of closed points, and the whole space. (This is clear from the above discussion for algebraically closed fields. The proof of the general case requires some commutative algebra, namely the fact, that the Krull dimension of k[t] is one -- see Krull's principal ideal theorem). =Properties= The most dramatic change in the topology from the classical picture to the new is that points are no longer necessarily closed; by expanding the definition, Grothendieck introduced generic points, which are the points with maximal closure, that is the minimal prime ideals. The closed points correspond to maximal ideals of A. However, the spectrum and projective spectrum are still T0 spaces: given two points P, Q, which are prime ideals of A, at least one of them, say P, does not contain the other. Then D(Q) contains P but, of course, not Q. Just as in classical algebraic geometry, any spectrum or projective spectrum is (quasi)compact, and if the ring in question is Noetherian then the space is a Noetherian space. However, these facts are counterintuitive: we do not normally expect open sets, other than connected components, to be compact, and for affine varieties (for example, Euclidean space) we do not even expect the space itself to be compact. This is one instance of the geometric unsuitability of the Zariski topology. Grothendieck solved this problem by defining the notion of properness of a scheme (actually, of a morphism of schemes), which recovers the intuitive idea of compactness: Proj is proper, but Spec is not.

As a bearer instrument, it differs from the more common types of investment securities in that it is unregistered‚Äîno records are kept of the owner, or the transactions involving ownership. Whoever physically holds the paper on which the bond is issued is the presumptive owner of the instrument. This is useful for investors who wish to retain anonymity. Recovery of the value of a bearer bond in the event of its loss, theft, or destruction is usually impossible. Some relief is possible in the case of United States public debt. Furthermore, while all bond types state maturity dates and interest rates, bearer bond coupons for interest payments are physically attached to the security and must be submitted to an authorized agent, in order to receive payment.  History  Bearer bonds have historically been the financial instrument of choice for money laundering, tax evasion, and concealed business transactions in general. In response, new issuances of bearer bonds have been severely curtailed in the United States since 1982. All the bearer bonds issued by the US Treasury have matured by May 2016. The amount outstanding is approximately $87 million, as of March 2020. = Chiasso financial smuggling case = From 2009-2012, a series of incidents involving the forgery and smuggling of U.S. bearer bonds in Italy and Switzerland occurred, beginning with the Chiasso financial smuggling case in June 2009, in which Italian financial police and custom guards seized documents purporting to be U.S. bearer bonds, totaling $134.5 billion in Chiasso, Switzerland, on the Italian border. The bonds were readily determined to be phony, the latest in a series of \\"billion-dollar bond\\" schemes that the United States Treasury calls \\"Morgenthaus.\\"  United States policy and practice  In the United States, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 substantially curtailed the issue of debt in bearer form. The act disallowed a tax-deduction of interest paid on any such bonds issued after 1982 by the issuer in the case of corporate bonds, and removed the tax-exemption of the interest to the holder in the case of municipal bonds. In contrast, registered bonds retained the tax-exempt treatment. A challenge to this tax treatment by the US state of South Carolina was heard by the US Supreme Court in the case of South Carolina v. Baker (1988), which upheld the law and brought to an end the further issue of virtually all US municipal bearer bonds.

He has been called the \\"Father of Modern Revivalism.\\". Finney was best known as a flamboyant revivalist preacher from 1825 to 1835 in the Burned-over District in Upstate New York and Manhattan, an opponent of Old School Presbyterian theology, an advocate of Christian perfectionism, and a religious writer. Together with several other evangelical leaders, his religious views led him to promote social reforms, such as abolitionism and equal education for women and African Americans. From 1835 he taught at Oberlin College of Ohio, which accepted students without regard to race or sex. He served as its second president from 1851 to 1865, and its faculty and students were activists for abolitionism, the Underground Railroad, and universal education.  Early life  Born in Warren, Connecticut, on August 29, 1792,. Finney was the youngest of nine children. The son of farmers who moved to the upstate frontier of Jefferson County, New York, after the American Revolutionary War, Finney never attended college. His leadership abilities, musical skill, 6'3\\" height, and piercing eyes gained him recognition in his community.. He and his family attended the Baptist church in Henderson, New York, where the preacher led emotional, revival-style meetings. The Baptists and the Methodists displayed fervor in the early 19th century.. He \\"read the law\\", studying as an apprentice to become a lawyer under Benjamin Wright.Bourne, Russell. Floating West. W. W. Norton. 1992. p. 177 In Adams, New York, he entered the congregation of George Washington Gale and became the director of the church choir. After a dramatic conversion experience and baptism into the Holy Spirit he gave up legal practice to preach the Gospel... As a young man Finney was a Master Mason, but after his conversion, he left the group as antithetical to Christianity and was active in Anti-Masonic movements.Charles E. Hambrick- Stowe, Charles G. Finney and the Spirit of American Evangelicalism (1996), p. 112 In 1821, Finney started studies at 29 under George Washington Gale, to become a licensed minister in the Presbyterian Church. Like his teacher Gale, he > \\"took a commission for six months of a Female Missionary Society, located in > Oneida County. I went into the northern part of Jefferson County and began > my labors at Evans' Mills, in the town of Le Ray.\\" When Gale moved to a farm in Western, Oneida County, New York, Finney accompanied him and worked on Gale's farm in exchange for instruction, a forerunner of Gale's Oneida Institute. He had many misgivings about the fundamental doctrines taught in Presbyterianism.. He moved to New York City in 1832, where he was minister of the Chatham Street Chapel and took the breathtaking step of barring from communion all slave owners and traders. Since the Chatham Street Chapel was not a church but a theater \\"fitted up\\" to serve as a church, a new Broadway Tabernacle was built for him in 1836 that was \\"the largest Protestant house of worship in the country.\\" In 1835, he became the professor of systematic theology at the newly formed Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Oberlin, Ohio..  Revivals  Finney was active as a revivalist from 1825 to 1835 in Jefferson County and for a few years in Manhattan. In 1830-1831, he led a revival in Rochester, New York, that has been noted as inspiring other revivals of the Second Great Awakening. A leading pastor in New York who was converted in the Rochester meetings gave the following account of the effects of Finney's meetings in that city: \\"The whole community was stirred. Religion was the topic of conversation in the house, in the shop, in the office and on the street. The only theater in the city was converted into a livery stable; the only circus into a soap and candle factory. Grog shops were closed; the Sabbath was honored; the sanctuaries were thronged with happy worshippers; a new impulse was given to every philanthropic enterprise; the fountains of benevolence were opened, and men lived to good.\\"Hyatt, 126 He was known for his innovations in preaching and the conduct of religious meetings, which often impacted entire communities. They included having women pray out loud in public meetings of mixed sexes; development of the \\"anxious seat,\\" where those considering becoming Christians could sit to receive prayer; and public censure of individuals by name in sermons and prayers.The various types of new measures are identified mostly by sources critical of Finney, such as ; ; and . He was also known for his extemporaneous preaching. Finney \\"had a deep insight into the almost interminable intricacies of human depravity.... He poured the floods of gospel love upon the audience. He took short-cuts to men's hearts, and his trip-hammer blows demolished the subterfuges of unbelief.\\" Disciples of Finney were Theodore Weld, John Humphrey Noyes, and Andrew Leete Stone.  Abolitionism  In addition to becoming a widely-popular Christian evangelist, Finney was involved with social reforms, particularly the abolitionist movement. Finney frequently denounced slavery from the pulpit, called it a \\"great national sin,\\" and refused Holy Communion to slaveholders.  President of Oberlin College  In 1835, the wealthy silk merchant and benefactor Arthur Tappan (1786-1865) offered financial backing to the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute (as Oberlin College had been known until 1850), and he invited Finney on the recommendation of abolitionist Theodore Dwight Weld (1803-1895), to establish its theological department. After much wrangling, Finney accepted if he was allowed to continue to preach in New York, the school admitted blacks, and free speech was guaranteed at Oberlin. After more than a decade, he was selected as its second president, serving from 1851 to 1866. (He had already served as acting president in 1849.){{cite webtitle=Charles Grandison Finney Papers  url=http://oberlinarchives.libraryhost.com/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id;=85/work=Oberlin College Archivespublisher=Oberlin Collegeaccessdate=30 April 2020url} Oberlin was the first American college to accept women and blacks as students in addition to white men. From its early years, its faculty and students were active in the abolitionist movement. They participated together with people of the town in biracial efforts to help fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad and to resist the Fugitive Slave Act.Charles E. Hambrick-Stowe, Charles G. Finney and the Spirit of American Evangelicalism (1996) p 199 Many slaves escaped to Ohio across the Ohio River from Kentucky, which made Ohio a critical area for their passage to freedom.  Personal life  Finney was twice a widower and married three times. In 1824, he married Lydia Root Andrews (1804‚Äì1847) while he lived in Jefferson County. They had six children together. In 1848, a year after Lydia's death, he married Elizabeth Ford Atkinson (1799‚Äì1863) in Ohio. In 1865, he married Rebecca Allen Rayl (1824‚Äì1907), also in Ohio. Each of Finney's three wives accompanied him on his revival tours and joined him in his evangelistic efforts. Finney's great- grandson, also named Charles Grandison Finney, became a famous author. Theology Finney was a New School Presbyterian, and his theology was similar to that of Nathaniel William Taylor. Finney departed from traditional Calvinist theology by teaching that people have free will to choose salvation. He argued that original sin was a \\"selfishness\\" that people can overcome if they made themselves a \\"new heart.\\" He taught that \\"Sin and holiness are voluntary acts of mind.\\" He also believed that preachers had important roles in producing revival and wrote in 1835, \\"A revival is not a miracle, or dependent on a miracle, in any sense. It is a purely philosophical result of the right use of the constituted means.\\" A major theme of his preaching was the need for conversion. He also focused on the responsibilities that converts had to dedicate themselves to disinterested benevolence and to work to build the kingdom of God on earth. Finney's eschatology was postmillennial, meaning he believed the Millennium (a thousand-year reign of true Christianity) would begin before Christ's Second Coming. Finney believed Christians could bring in the Millennium by ridding the world of \\"great and sore evils.\\" Frances FitzGerald wrote, \\"In his preaching the emphasis was always on the ability of men‚Äîand women‚Äîto choose their own salvation, to work for the general welfare, and to build a new society.\\" Finney was an advocate of perfectionism, the doctrine that through complete faith in Christ believers could receive a \\"second blessing of the Holy Spirit\\" and reach Christian perfection, a higher level of sanctification. For Finney, that meant living in obedience to God's law and loving God and one's neighbors but was not a sinless perfection. For Finney, even sanctified Christians are susceptible to temptation and capable of sin. Finney believed that it is possible for Christians to backslide and to lose their salvation. Benjamin Warfield, a Calvinist professor of theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, claimed, \\"God might be eliminated from it [Finney's theology] entirely without essentially changing its character.\\"B.

Esterhazy retired from the military with the rank of Major in 1898‚Äîpresumably under pressure‚Äîand fled by way of Brussels to the United Kingdom, where he lived in the town of Harpenden in Hertfordshire until his death in 1923.‚ÄúESTERHAZY, Ferdinand‚Äù in Register of Deaths for the St Albans Registration District, volume 3a (1923), p. 7143 Biography =Ancestry= Charles Marie Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy was born in Paris, France, the son of General Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy (1807‚Äì1857), who later distinguished himself as division commander in the Crimean War. His paternal grandfather, Jean Marie Auguste Walsin-Esterhazy, born in 1767 at Valleraugue, was the illegitimate son of Countess Marie Anne Esterhazy de Gal√°ntha (1741‚Äì1823), by her affair with Jean Andr√© C√©sar de Ginestous (1725‚Äì1810), governor of Le Vigan (Gard).Maurice Baumont, Aux sources de l'affaire: l'Affaire Dreyfus d'apr√®s les archives (1959), p. 137 The boy was adopted by a Dr Walsin, a French doctor in the service of the Austrian emperor. Growing up under the name of Jean Marie Auguste Walsin, he became a business man and landowner in N√Æmes, and added the name of Esterh√°zy, apparently without the agreement of the family, after being acknowledged by his mother about 1797. This branch of the Esterh√°zys had settled in France at the end of the 17th century and provided military officers to France, namely in its hussar regiments. =Early life and military career= Charles Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy was left an orphan in September 1857, aged only nine. After some schooling at the Lyc√©e Bonaparte in Paris, he attempted in vain to enter the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He disappears from public records in 1865; by 1869 he had been enlisted in the Legion of Antibes, a unit of French volunteers in the service of Pope Pius IX. =Franco-Prussian War= In June 1870, his uncle's influence enabled Esterhazy to be commissioned into the French Foreign Legion. It was an irregular appointment as he had neither been promoted from the ranks after service as a non-commissioned officer, nor graduated from a military academy. However, the start of the Franco-Prussian War in July precluded any action being taken against him. He then assumed the title of count, to which he was not entitled.As descendant of a bastard of a daughter of Esterhazy, he was not entitled to a title which does not pass (1) to bastards (2) to daughters. There being a dearth of officers after the catastrophe of Sedan, Esterhazy was able to pass muster as a lieutenant and then as a captain. He served as an infantry officer in the campaigns of the Loire and of the Jura Mountains. After peace was declared, he remained in the army. =Post-war career= Between 1880 and 1882 Esterhazy was employed to translate German at the French military counter-intelligence section, where he became acquainted with Major Henry and Lieutenant Colonel Sandherr, both to become major figures in the Dreyfus affair. He was then employed at the French War Ministry. He never appeared in his regiment at Beauvais, and for about five years led a life of dissipation in Paris, as a result of which his small fortune was soon squandered. In 1882 Esterhazy was attached to the expedition sent to Tunis. While there he was employed in the Intelligence Department, then in the Native Affairs Department of the regency. On his own authority he inserted in the official records a citation of his \\"exploits in war\\", which was later recognized as false. Returning to France in 1885, Esterhazy remained in garrison at Marseille for a long time. Having come to the end of his financial resources, he married in 1886, but he soon spent his wife's dowry. In 1888 she was forced to demand a separation. In 1892, through the influence of General F√©lix Gustave Saussier, Esterhazy succeeded in getting a nomination as garrison-major in the Seventy-fourth Regiment of the line at Rouen. Being thus in the neighborhood of Paris, he resumed a life of speculation and excess. His inheritance squandered, Esterhazy had tried to retrieve his fortune in gambling-houses and on the stock-exchange; hard pressed by his creditors, he had recourse to extreme measures. Having seconded Andr√© Cr√©mieu-Foa in his duel with √âdouard Drumont in 1892, Esterhazy claimed that this action had made his family, as well as his military seniors, quarrel with him. He produced false letters to support this allegation and threatened to kill both himself and his children. Through the medium of Zadoc Kahn, chief rabbi of France, Esterhazy obtained assistance from the Rothschild family (June 1894). At the same time he was on good terms with the editors of the antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole, which he supplied with information. For an officer whose original commission had been irregular, Esterhazy's military advancement had been unusually rapid: lieutenant in 1874, captain in 1880, decorated in 1882, major in 1892. The reports on him were generally excellent. Nevertheless, he considered himself wronged. In his letters he continually launched into recrimination and abuse against his chiefs. He made negative written comments on the French Army, and even France herself, for which he predicted and hoped that new disasters were in store. =Dreyfus affair= Esterhazy as caricatured by Jean Baptiste Guth in Vanity Fair, May 1898The Dreyfus affair was triggered in September 1894 when an office cleaner at the German Embassy in Paris, who was also an agent of French military intelligence, passed her French contacts a handwritten memorandum (widely known as the bordereau), evidently written by an unnamed French officer, offering the German Embassy various confidential military documents. Captain Alfred Dreyfus was picked by the army as the alleged traitor in October 1894. Suspicion seems to have fallen on Dreyfus mainly because the handwriting was a match for his own, but also because he was a Jew. The official evidence against him depended overwhelmingly on the contention that his handwriting matched that on the bordereau. Convicted, he was formally stripped of his military rank in a public ceremony of degradation, and then shipped to the penal colony of Devil's Island (l'√éle du Diable) off the coast of French Guiana. In 1896, Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart, the then-new head of the Intelligence Service, uncovered a letter sent by Schwartzkoppen to Esterhazy. After comparison of Esterhazy's handwriting with that of the bordereau, he became convinced of Esterhazy's guilt of the crime for which Dreyfus had been convicted. In 1897, after fruitless efforts to persuade his superiors to take the new evidence seriously and being transferred to Tunisia in an effort to silence him, Picquart provided proof to Dreyfus' lawyers. They started a campaign to bring Esterhazy to justice. In 1898 an ex-lover of Esterhazy made public letters of his in which he expressed his hatred of France and his contempt for the army. However, Esterhazy was still protected by the High Staff, who did not want to see the judgment of 1895 put into doubt. In order to clear his name, Esterhazy asked for a trial behind closed doors by French Military Justice (10‚Äì11 January 1898). He was acquitted, a judgment which ignited anti-Semitic riots in Paris. On 13 January 1898, √âmile Zola published his famous J'Accuse‚Ä¶!, which accused the French government of anti-Semitism and especially focused on the court-martial and jailing of Dreyfus. Headstone: buried under the alias of Count de Voilemont =Flight to Britain and later years= Esterhazy was discreetly put on military pension with the rank of major. On 1 September 1898, having shaved off his mustache, he fled France, via Brussels, for the relative safety of the United Kingdom. From Milton Road in the town of Harpenden, he continued to write in anti-Semitic papers such as La Libre Parole until his death in 1923. He is buried in St Nicholas' churchyard, Harpenden, under the name of Jean de Voilemont. A headstone was erected shortly after with the false name and a false birthdate with an inscription from Percy Bysshe Shelley: \\"He has outsoared the shadow of our night\\". =Revisionist thesis: Was Esterhazy a double agent?= The bordereau (memorandum) which sparked the Dreyfus affair The French historian Jean Doise espoused the revisionist hypothesis that Esterhazy might have been a French double agent masquerading as a traitor in order to pass along misinformation to the German army. Doise was not the first writer to explore the hypothesis of Esterhazy as a double agent: earlier writings by Michel de Lombar√®s and Henri Giscard d'Estaing, though they differred in the details of their theories, also presented this line of argument. According to Doise, Esterhazy's perceived bitterness and utter lack of patriotic feeling, along with his fluency in German, were qualities that would have helped him to pose as an effective and unrepentant traitor.France at War ‚Äì The Dreyfus Case and the French 75 In Tunis, he was judged to have become too intimate with the German military attach√©. In 1892, he was the object of an accusation made to the head of the staff, General Brault. In 1893, he entered (or, if one accepts the revisionist explanation, pretended to enter) the service of Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, the German military attach√© in Paris. According to later disclosures he received from the German attach√© a monthly pension of 2000 marks (equivalent to over ‚Ç¨12000 in 2015 terms)https://www.historicalstatistics.org/Currencyconverter.html. In return, Esterhazy furnished him in the first place with information (or, as argued, misinformation) about artillery. Esterhazy reported that he got his information from Major Henry, who had been his comrade in the French military counter-intelligence section of the War Ministry, in 1876. However, Henry, limited to a very special branch of the service, was hardly in a position to furnish details on technical questions. The main architect of the disinformation campaign is claimed to have been Colonel Sandherr, head of French military counter-intelligence. The lack of value of the material furnished by Esterhazy soon became so apparent that Alessandro Panizzardi, the Italian military attach√©, to whom Schwartzkoppen communicated it without divulging the name of his informant, began to doubt his qualifications as an officer. To convince the attach√©, it was necessary for Esterhazy to show himself one day in uniform, galloping behind a well-known general. The infamous document, or \\"bordereau\\", which was used to convict Dreyfus had been retrieved from a wastepaper basket at the German Embassy by a cleaning lady who was in the employ of French military counterintelligence. This document had been torn up but was easily pieced together. It announced, among other items, a forthcoming report on a new French 120mm howitzer Canon de 120C Modele 1890 Baquet and the comportment of its hydraulic recoil mechanism, as well as detailed manuals describing the current organization of French field artillery.\\" However, the French army had already rejected the 120 mm model as unworkable and had begun development of the revolutionary (for its time) 75 mm field gun. The argument is thus made that the document was designed to prevent the Germans from discovering the development of the French 75. However, there are reports of Esterhazy admitting that he had \\"indeed been a spy for Germany\\".http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/193419/Ferdinand- Walsin- Esterhazy As such, the historical revisionism theories proposing that Esterhazy was merely pretending to be a spy are controversial as they deny concrete evidence of Esterhazy spying against France.

Platt, creator of the Platt AmendmentCartoon protesting the AmendmentDuring the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States maintained a large military arsenal in Cuba to protect U.S. holdings and to mediate Spanish‚ÄìCuban relations.Schoultz, Lars, Beneath the United States: A History of U.S. Policy Towards Latin America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp.139-151. In 1899, the McKinley administration settled on occupation as its response to the appearance of a revolutionary government in Cuba following the end of Spanish control.Keen, Benjamin and Haynes, Keith, A History of Latin America: Volume 2 Independence to the Present (Boston: Houghton Mifflen Co., 2004), pp.379-380. The Platt Amendment was an addition to the earlier Teller Amendment, which had previously limited US involvement in Cuba relating to its treatment after the war, particularly in preventing its annexation which had been proposed by various expansionist political entities within the US. Senator Teller himself had a history of opposing American imperialism, criticising the American campaigns in Panama and the Philippines. Yet in 1894 he had been an arch-expansionist supporting potential plans to annex Cuba, and Teller would go on to support the Platt Amendment. Some historians have questioned Teller's intentions, claiming that the real motive behind the resolution was to protect American beet sugar growers from Cuban competition. On the other hand, Teller became a leading opponent of land annexation in Cuba to grow sugar in the early 1900s, as well as President Roosevelt's plans to grant tariff preferences to Cuba in 1903. The Platt Amendment originated from American mistrust in the Cuban Constituent Assembly to formulate a new relationship between Cuba and the U.S. Senator Orville H. Platt, chair of the Senate Committee with Relations on Cuba, spearheaded the bill alongside General Leonard Wood, the Governor of Cuba at the time and Secretary of War Elihu Root. Tasked with balancing Cuban independence with American desires to control Cuban politicians deemed unfit for self- governance, they established The Platt Amendment to maintain public order and turn Cuba into a \\"self-governing colony\\". The Platt Amendment was initially intended to be its own bill, but it became an amendment as the 56th Congress ended on March 4th, 1901, and there was no time for the proposal to be submitted as a separate bill. General Leonard Wood used the financial resources of the Cuban treasury to create sanitation systems. A handful of civil rights, including the right to vote, were extended to literate, adult, male Cubans with property worth $250 or more, largely resulting in exclusion of the Afro-Cuban population and women from participation. Provisions of the amendment Platt Amendement, p. 1. Platt Amendement, p. 2. The Platt Amendment was introduced to Congress by Senator Orville H. Platt on February 25, 1901. It passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 43 to 20, and although it was initially rejected by the Cuban assembly, the amendment was eventually accepted by a vote of 16 to 11 with four abstentions and integrated into the 1901 Cuban Constitution. The Platt Amendment outlined the role of the United States in Cuba and the Caribbean, limiting Cuba's right to make treaties with other nations and restricting Cuba in the conduct of foreign policy and commercial relations. It also established that Cuba's boundaries would not include the Isle of Pines (Isla de la Juventud) until its title could be established in a future treaty, and that Cuba must sell or lease lands to the United States necessary for coaling or the development of naval stations. It read: After U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt withdrew federal troops from the island in 1902, Cuba signed the treaty the next year after which Cuba executed a lease of land to the United States for a coaling and naval station at Guant√°namo Bay. Originally the U.S. would have been able to build four military bases, but Cuba managed to negotiate this down to two, those being Guantanamo and Bahia Honda, which was traded in 1912 for more land at Guantanamo. This was a surprise given that Secretary Root had indicated his wish for the U.S. to become the owner and enforcer of Cuba's waterfront while the Platt Amendment was being drafted. Aftermath Following acceptance of the amendment, the United States ratified a tariff that gave Cuban sugar preference in the U.S. market and protection to select U.S. products in the Cuban market. The huge American investment into sugar led to land being concentrated into the hands of the largest sugar mills, however, with estimates that 20% of all Cuban land was owned by these mills. This led to further impoverishment of the rural masses. Workers on the mill were in constant fear of eviction, with cheap imported labour from other parts of the Caribbean keeping wages very low and the prices for independent cane pushed down to a minimum. In addition, the mills monopolised the railroads and ran them for private benefit. The lack of consumer purchasing power and the limited market available for manufactured goods meant that little industrialisation would occur in the decade after the 1903 Treaty of Relations. Overall, over $200 million was spent by American companies on Cuban sugar between 1903 and 1913. Tom√°s Estrada Palma, who had once favored outright annexation of Cuba by the United States, became president of Cuba on May 20, 1902. He was re-elected in 1905 despite accusations of fraud from his liberal opponents, but was forced to resign along with the rest of the executive when opposition against his rule turned violent. The U.S. invoked the Platt Amendment to begin the Second Occupation of Cuba and install a Provisional Government. Political instability and frequent American occupation through the early 1900s meant that legitimate constitutional rule was increasingly difficult to come about. Though Cuban citizens enjoyed an improved standard of living in this period, Article 40 of the 1901 Cuban Constitution and Article III of the Platt Amendment meant that constitutional rights could be suspended under emergency provisions. Therefore, the Platt Amendment contributed to an erosion of the individual rights of the Cuban people, and it was not long before the Cuban public were calling for a replacement to the 1901 Constitution. The Platt Amendment was a major blow to hopes of social advancement for Afro-Cubans, who hoped that their participation in the Spanish-American War would mean equality with the white planters and commercial elites of Cuba. Nearly 40% of the Cuban fighting force against Spain were made up of people of colour, and Afro-Cubans had spent generations fighting for their country's independence. As well as becoming disenfranchised through voting acts, Afro-Cubans were also blocked from many state institutions as they now required educational or property qualifications to be gained. Tensions between Afro-Cubans and U.S. military officials were rife, with hostile language and sometimes gunfire being exchanged between the two groups. Frustrated middle class blacks would launch the Independent Party of Colour (PIC) in 1908, but this was barred by the Cuban Congress soon along with all other parties of colour, accused of inciting race war. The PIC's call for limited armed protests would eventually spark the Negro Rebellion of 1912 which killed between 3,000 and 6,000 and led to the PIC dissolving afterwards. Many African-Americans also joined Afro-Cubans in solidarity, hoping that fighting for America would lead to more opportunities back home, but they too were left disappointed. Guantanamo Bay from satellite images Women also suffered as a result of the Platt Amendment's conditions. As with Afro-Cubans, women played important roles in the Cuban independence movement and were characterised as 'mambisas', or courageous warrior mothers symbolising the struggle for social justice. However, they were also denied voting rights and female suffrage would not be obtained until 1940. Any attempts by women to discuss gender equality with the Cuban government saw them labelled as nationalists or flat out ignored. Most of the Platt Amendment provisions were repealed in 1934 when the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934 between the United States and Cuba was negotiated as a part of U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt's \\"Good Neighbor policy\\" toward Latin America. Jos√© Manuel Cortina and other members of the Cuban Constitutional Convention of 1940 eliminated the Platt Amendment from the new Cuban constitution. The long-term lease of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base continues. The Cuban government since 1959 has strongly denounced the treaty as a violation of Article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which declares a treaty void if procured by the threat or use of force. However, Article 4 of the Vienna Convention states that its provisions shall not be applied retroactively. Historian Louis A. Perez Jr. has argued that the Platt Amendment resulted in the conditions it had hoped to avoid, including Cuban volatility. See also * Pearcy v.

Trephination in Mesoamerica has been practised by a number of pre- Columbian cultures in the Mesoamerican region, dating from at least the mid- Preclassic era (ca. 1500 BCE), and continuing up to the late Postclassic, or ca. 1200 CE.See summary in Romero (1970). Trephination involves an intentional and planned operation to open or bore into the skull on a live subject, using tools specifically designed for the purpose. This can be accomplished by several techniques, such as drilling, incising and abrasion, or some combination of these. The purpose of such operations ranges from the medicinal (intended to relieve pressure, or address a number of other ailments) to the ritualised and experimental. In pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, evidence for the practice of trephination and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources, including physical cranial remains of pre-Columbian burials, allusions in iconographic artworks and reports from the post-conquest period. Overview Trephination has been practised by a variety of historical cultures and societies across the globe, with evidence for it dating back to the Neolithic period,See Walker (1997), which reports the \\"earliest unequivocal evidence for trepanation\\" in a burial near Ensisheim in the Alsace region of France, that was dated to 5100-4900 BCE. See also citation and commentary in Tiesler (2003a). and its use has continued up to the present era under certain limited circumstances by a few cultures. If the patient manages to survive the procedure, the bone begins to slowly grow back from the rim of the hole towards the center. This new bone growth is measurably thinner than the undamaged bone at the rim, providing scientists examining a trephinated skull with a means to establishing whether or not the person lived beyond the operation. Among New World societies, trephination is most commonly found in the Andean civilizations such as the Inca,Tiesler (2003a) where it is frequently associated with pre-existing cranial damage, indicating that it had a use as a reasonably-successful medical procedure-- by one estimate, more than 70% of the patients survived the operation.Verano (1997), as cited in Tiesler (2003a). In this context, 'successful' is an assessment of the patient survival-rate, and not necessarily of its efficacy as a cure to a pre-existing ailment. Generally, whether or not the treatment was successful in alleviating the symptoms of the patient's medical complaint is difficult to ascertain from the osteological data. Recently, anthropologists have discovered evidence which suggests that survival rates may have been as high as 80 to 90 percent.Science News / Incan Skull Surgery Its prevalence among Mesoamerican civilizations is much lower, at least judging from the comparatively few trephinated crania which have been uncovered.Tiesler (2003a). The archaeological record is further complicated by the practice of skull mutilation and modification which was carried out after the death of the subject, in order to fashion \\"trophy skulls\\" and the like of captives and enemies. This was a reasonably widespread tradition, illustrated in pre-Columbian art which on occasion depicts rulers adorned with or carrying the modified skulls of their defeated enemies, or of the ritualistic display of sacrificial victims. Several Mesoamerican cultures used a skull-rack (known by its Nahuatl term, tzompantli ) on which skulls were impaled in rows or columns of wooden stakes. Even so, some evidence of genuine trepanation in Mesoamerica (i.e., where the subject was living) has been recovered. Survey =Early colonial reports= Sixteenth-century Spanish colonial accounts like those of Bernardino de Sahag√∫n and Bishop Diego de Landa contain references to the use of trepanation techniques among Mesoamericans to alleviate pain, such as for persistent headaches and that which results from the practice of deliberately deforming the cranium (for aesthetic purposes) by using compression boards and other methods. =Central Mexico and Oaxaca= The earliest archaeological surveyAccording to Tiesler (2003a). published of trepanated crania was a late 19th-century study of several specimens recovered from the Tarahumara mountains by the Norwegian ethnographer Carl Lumholtz.Lumholtz's study was published in the journal American Anthropologist (Lumholtz & Hrdliƒçka 1897). Later studies documented cases identified from a range of sites in Oaxaca and central Mexico, such as Tilantongo, Oaxaca and the major Zapotec site of Monte Alb√°n. Two specimens from the Tlatilco civilization's homelands (which flourished around 1400 BCE) indicate the practice has a lengthy tradition,Romero (1970). although the cultural provenance of these particular specimens has been disputed.See Tiesler (2003a) for mention of dissenting views. A 1999 study of seven trepanated crania from Monte Alb√°n showed a combination of single and multiple elliptical holes drilled or worn into the cranial cap, performed exclusively on the upper Parietal bones. The sample crania were from both male and female adults, and evidence of healing around the perforations suggested that about half had survived the operation. Most of the skulls in the study showed signs of earlier cranial damage, indicating (as with the Andean examples) that the operations were an attempt to repair or alleviate this head-trauma.Tiesler (1999). From these analyses, it appears that a technique of straightforward abrasion was employed in the earliest-dated finds, to be combined later on with drilling and incision techniques. Crania recovered from Cholula show another form of trepanation (\\"supra-inial lesion\\"), where a depression has been worn into the back of the skull, without however substantially perforating it.Rodr√≠guez (1972), as cited in Tiesler (2003a). =Maya region and Yucat√°n Peninsula= Specimens identified from the Maya civilization region of southern Mexico, Guatemala and the Yucat√°n Peninsula show no evidence of the drilling or cutting techniques found in central and highland Mexico. Instead, the pre-Columbian Maya seemed to have utilised an abrasive technique which ground away at the back of the skull, thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it, similar to the examples from Cholula. Many of the skulls from the Maya region date from the Postclassic period (ca. 950-1400), and include specimens found at Palenque in Chiapas, and recovered from the Sacred Cenote at the prominent Postclassic site of Chichen Itza in northern Yucat√°n. The practice of deliberate cranial deformation or flattening is well documented among the pre-Columbian Maya peoples, and is evidenced from the Preclassic era onwards. By the use of cradleboards and other compression techniques applied to the growing skull from infancy, a variety of head-shapes were fashioned, with different regions and time-periods exhibiting a difference in style and ideal. The practice was applied to both males and females, and was not thought to be particularly associated with class or social standing. It was widely adopted however, to the point where one particular studyTiesler (2003b) which examined over 1,500 skulls drawn from across the Maya region determined that at least 88% exhibited some form of intentional cranial deformation. These practices have no known therapeutic value although they may have been intertwined with the expression of Maya cultural values, beliefs and identity.

Created by writer Chuck Dixon and artist Tom Lyle, King Snake first appeared in Robin #2 (1991). He is a master martial artist and is the father of the villain Bane. Fictional character biography Sir Edmund Dorrance, a.k.a. King Snake, is a British native who first distinguished himself in the Royal Artillery (a corps of the British Army). He and some friends then became mercenaries, offering their professional expertise to various anti-communist rebels, and made considerable money in doing so. While in Santa Prisca working with local rebels, his camp was taken by surprise by government commandos and Edmund was blinded by gunfire. He fled the country, leaving for dead a female rebel with whom he had slept. The woman was actually alive and pregnant with Edmund's son. Both she and her child were imprisoned for Edmund's crimes against the Santa Prisca government, with the child growing up in prison to become the villainous Bane. Edmund subsequently moved to Hong Kong and used the money he had acquired to start a double life. To the public, he was a Hong Kong businessman worth millions, with interests in shipping, banking, and electronics, while in secret he was one of the most feared men in Asia, a giant in the heroin trade. Taking on the name King Snake (after a snake known for its immunity to other snakes' venom and eats them), he found willing soldiers in the Ghost Dragon Chinese youth gang of Macau, Kowloon, and Hong Kong. Although he had a strong power base in Hong Kong, he could not hope to stay when the island was handed over to China. He began extending his interests into France and the United States. A jingoistic man, he felt that Hong Kong had been made into a great city purely due to British influence, and decided to lay waste to the city rather than have it be soiled by falling into Chinese hands. His plans to release a Nazi-developed plague after leaving Hong Kong were foiled by Robin (Tim Drake). At the time, Tim was working with former DEA agent Clyde Rawlins, and the deadly martial artist Lady Shiva. The United States had attempted to stop Sir Edmund's expansion into America, to no avail. Edmund had killed Rawlins' family in retaliation, and Rawlins himself went rogue in order to pursue King Snake outside the law. Lady Shiva, meanwhile, sought King Snake because he was rumored to be the deadliest male martial artist in the world, and she wished to face him in battle. They eventually stormed King Snake's skyscraper headquarters and defeated him, though Rawlins died in the attempt and Shiva mostly watched the proceedings. Robin knocked Sir Edmund out a window, and Shiva ordered Robin to kill King Snake while he hung from the building. Robin refused to do so and left, believing Edmund was dead. Presumably Shiva either let Edmund fall or else threw him off the ledge of the building to die. King Snake actually landed on a parapet. Shiva examined him, and, satisfied that he had broken his back and was thus no longer a threat, left him. After having his spine reinforced and regaining his mobility, Sir Edmund moved to Gotham, where he wrested control of the Chinatown district away from the Triad gangs, revealing himself to be alive, and initially focusing on Robin for revenge (although his memories of the battle in Hong Kong were muddled, he eventually remembered that it was Lady Shiva that was most responsible for his defeat there, although he still remained hostile to Robin). King Snake also begins his feud with Batman after he defeated him in combat. Not long after, however, he lost power in a gang war, with his own Ghost Dragons rebelling and the Triad gangs sending assassins (such as the Silver Monkey of the Brotherhood of the Fist) after him. King Snake survived and joined the international terrorist cult Kobra. He took advantage of a leadership struggle in that organization, with the previous \\"Lord Naja-Naja\\" disgraced, and Danny Temple (a friend of Robin's) was revealed to be the next in line for leadership. Temple was abducted and taken to a mountain lair of the cult. During the ceremony intended to invest Temple with leadership, however, King Snake rebelled, declared himself the next Naja-Naja, and his followers healed his eyes in a Lazarus Pit the cult has access to (which could only be opened by Temple, explaining Sir Edmund's subterfuge). His eyesight restored, Sir Edmund battled against Robin (who was attempting to rescue Danny Temple), while Kobra (the prior leader of the cult) attempted to regain control of the cult. Luckily for Robin, Sir Edmund was unaccustomed to seeing, actually throwing his fighting style off. A vial of cobra poison used in the Kobra-cult initiation ceremony was knocked over, and in his attempts to warn King Snake, Robin accidentally caused the villain to be blinded a second time. Robin and Danny Temple escaped, while King Snake was left trapped in the base with no escape. After a significant amount of time, the villain Bane finally learned the identity of his father and tracked King Snake down to the mountain base. Sir Edmund had survived months alone, and was barely alive and severely malnourished. Bane was emotionally conflicted during the reunion, and apparently intended to kill his father several times, but did not. King Snake tried once more to seize control of the Kobra Cult, this time with his son at his side. After Robin and Batman intervened, however, Bane sided with them. In the resulting struggle, King Snake was knocked down a deep crevice, apparently dying. During the 2009 - 2010 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, King Snake is among the many deceased villains that receive a black power ring and is reanimated into a Black Lantern. Included are the Trigger Twins and Magpie.Blackest Night: Batman #1 (2009) He takes a leadership role among the Black Lanterns, coordinating Black Lantern strikes throughout Gotham City.Blackest Night: Batman #2 (2009) King Snake is alive once again the \\"DC Rebirth\\" reboot. He is one of the many villains taken down by Batman and Catwoman after he takes her along with him on an average night of his job.Batman (vol. 3) #14 Powers and abilities The King Snake has no superhuman powers. However, he is a master of several of the world‚Äôs most deadly martial arts. He kills without conscience and has earned the title of \\"the most dangerous man alive\\". The King Snake is also blind but has made it an asset rather than a handicap, as he has honed all of his other senses to an uncanny degree (similar to the Marvel Comics character Daredevil). He uses the dark as his weapon, and has become so used to fighting in the dark that he was actually less effective as a combatant when his vision was briefly restored by a Lazarus Pit, allowing Robin to defeat him in the subsequent struggle. In other media While King Snake does not appear himself in the Fox series Gotham, he is alluded to in the fifth and final season. In this version, Bane (portrayed by Shane West) is given the real name Eduardo Dorrance, a reference to Edmund Dorrance, who was his father in the original comics.

Production Michael Faraday first synthesized tetrachloroethylene in 1821 by thermal decomposition of hexachloroethane. :C2Cl6 -> C2Cl4 \\\\+ Cl2 Most tetrachloroethylene is produced by high temperature chlorinolysis of light hydrocarbons. The method is related to Faraday's discovery since hexachloroethane is generated and thermally decomposes. Side products include carbon tetrachloride, hydrogen chloride, and hexachlorobutadiene. Several other methods have been developed. When 1,2-dichloroethane is heated to 400 ¬∞C with chlorine, tetrachloroethylene is produced by the chemical reaction: :ClCH2CH2Cl + 3 Cl2 ‚Üí Cl2C=CCl2 \\\\+ 4 HCl This reaction can be catalyzed by a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminium chloride or by activated carbon. Trichloroethylene is a major byproduct, which is separated by distillation.

Uses Tetrachloroethylene is an excellent solvent for organic materials. Otherwise it is volatile, highly stable, and nonflammable. For these reasons, it is widely used in dry cleaning. It is also used to degrease metal parts in the automotive and other metalworking industries, usually as a mixture with other chlorocarbons. It appears in a few consumer products including paint strippers and spot removers. It is also used in aerosol preparations. It is used in neutrino detectors where a neutrino interacts with a neutron in the chlorine atom and converts it to a proton to form argon. =Historical applications= Tetrachloroethylene was once extensively used as an intermediate in the manufacture of HFC-134a and related refrigerants. In the early 20th century, tetrachloroethene was used for the treatment of hookworm infestation. Health and safety The acute toxicity of tetrachloroethylene \\"is moderate to low\\". \\"Reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing\\". The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified tetrachloroethylene as a Group 2A carcinogen, which means that it is probably carcinogenic to humans.IARC monograph. Tetrachloroethylene, Vol. 63, p. 159. Last Updated May 20, 1997. Last retrieved June 22, 2007. Like many chlorinated hydrocarbons, tetrachloroethylene is a central nervous system depressant and can enter the body through respiratory or dermal exposure.Control of Exposure to Perchloroethylene in Commercial Drycleaning . Hazard Controls: Publication 97-157. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Tetrachloroethylene dissolves fats from the skin, potentially resulting in skin irritation. Owing to tetrachloroethylene's toxicity and cancer risks, California's Air Resources Board banned the substance from use in new dry- cleaning machines in 2007, with older PCE-using machines shut down by mid-2010 and the use of all such machines to be discontinued in California by 2023. Animal studies and a study of 99 twins showed there is a \\"lot of circumstantial evidence\\" that exposure to tetrachloroethylene increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease ninefold. Larger population studies are planned.Industrial Solvent Linked to Increased Risk of Parkinson's Disease Also, tetrachloroethylene has been shown to cause liver tumors in mice and kidney tumors in male rats. At temperatures over , such as in welding, tetrachloroethylene can be oxidized into phosgene, an extremely poisonous gas. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has compiled extensive health and safety information for tetrachloroethylene, including recommendations for dry cleaning establishments. Tetrachloroethylene exposure has been linked to pronounced acquired color vision deficiencies after chronic exposure. =Testing for exposure= Tetrachloroethylene exposure can be evaluated by a breath test, analogous to breath-alcohol measurements. Because it is stored in the body's fat and slowly released into the bloodstream, tetrachloroethylene can be detected in the breath for weeks following a heavy exposure. Tetrachloroethylene and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a breakdown product of tetrachloroethylene, can be detected in the blood. In Europe, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) recommends for tetrachloroethylene an occupational exposure limit (8 hour time-weighted average) of 20 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 40 ppm.  Environmental contamination  Tetrachloroethylene is a common soil contaminant. With a specific gravity greater than 1, tetrachloroethylene will be present as a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are released. Because of its mobility in groundwater, its toxicity at low levels, and its density (which causes it to sink below the water table), cleanup activities are more difficult than for oil spills: oil has a specific gravity less than 1. Recent research on soil and ground water pollution by tetrachloroethylene has focused on in-place remediation. Instead of excavation or extraction for above-ground treatment or disposal, tetrachloroethylene contamination has been successfully remediated by chemical treatment or bioremediation. Bioremediation has been successful under anaerobic conditions by reductive dechlorination by Dehalococcoides sp. and under aerobic conditions by cometabolism by Pseudomonas sp. Partial degradation daughter products include trichloroethylene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride; full degradation converts tetrachloroethylene to ethene and hydrogen chloride dissolved in water. Estimates state that 85% of tetrachloroethylene produced is released into the atmosphere; while models from OECD assumed that 90% is released into the air and 10% to water. Based on these models, its distribution in the environment is estimated to be in the air (76.39% - 99.69%), water (0.23% - 23.2%), soil (0.06-7%), with the remainder in the sediment and biota. Estimates of lifetime in the atmosphere vary, but a 1987 survey estimated the lifetime in the air to be about 2 months in the Southern Hemisphere and 5‚Äì6 months in the Northern Hemisphere. Degradation products observed in a laboratory include phosgene, trichloroacetyl chloride, hydrogen chloride, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Tetrachloroethylene is degraded by hydrolysis, and is persistent under aerobic conditions. It is degraded by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions, with degradation products such as trichloroethylene, dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene, and ethane.Watts P. (2006).

This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendants of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus Sphenodon, which contains a single species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes. Evolution Holotype specimen of Tetrapodophis, which were mesozoic four-legged snakes Lizards were originally split into two clades: the Iguania and the Scleroglossa. Snakes and amphisbaenians belong within the clade Scleroglossa. Analysis of teeth has indicated that Iguania is made up of the sister taxa Chamaeleonidae and Agamidae. Snakes are actually a branch within the lizard group. In fact, some lizards, such as the Varanids, are more closely related to snakes than they are to other lizards. Varanids are a diverse group of lizards living from Africa, throughout south, central, and east Asia, as well as the Indo-Pacific islands and Australia. Snakes currently have about 3,070 extant species, which are grouped into the scolecophidians and the alethinophidians. The scolecophidians comprise about 370 species and are represented by small snakes with a limited gape size. The alethinophidians comprise about 2,700 species and are represented by the more common snakes. As snakes evolved, their gape size increased from the narrowness of the scolecophidians, which allowed for the digestion of larger prey. There are about 600 species of venomous snakes, which all belong to Caenophidia, although the majority of caenophidians are non-venomous colubrids. While amphisbaenians are mostly limbless, three species have reduced forms of front limbs. Morphological data shows that species with front limbs form a sister group to those that are limbless. This means that the amphisbaenians‚Äô loss of limbs occurred only once. A genetic study on the genome of the tuatara suggests a divergence rate of around 240 million years ago during the Triassic. =Fossil record= The oldest known record is the indeterminate lepidosaur SMNS 91060 and 91060 Snakes do not have an extensive fossil record; the oldest known fossil is from between early and late Cretaceous period. There were Tertiary fossil snakes that became extinct by the end of the Eocene period. The first colubrid also appeared in the Eocene period. Lizards first appeared in the middle Jurassic period, and this is when the scincomorph and the anguimorph lizards were first seen. The Gekkotans first appear in the late Jurassic period and the iguanians first appear in the late Cretaceous period. The lizards of the Cretaceous period represent extinct genera and species. The majority of amphisbaenians first appeared during the early Cenozoic period. Rhynchocephalian fossils first appear in the Middle Triassic period, between 238-240 million years ago, making them the earliest lepidosaurian fossils found to date. The tuatara can now only be found on small islands off the New Zealand coast. However, fossil records show that it once lived on mainland New Zealand and Rhynchocephalia as a whole was once distributed globally. The Rhynchocephalia originated by the Middle Triassic period and were distributed worldwide. Except for the single species of tuatara that now lives in New Zealand, all species became extinct in the late Cretaceous, although material is known from the Miocene of New Zealand. This extinction is associated with the introduction of mammals, such as rats. The modern tuatara's skull anatomy is significantly different from the best known Mesozoic taxa. Wild populations of tuatara can be found on 32 islands; in addition to three islands in which populations have formed due to migration. Description Schematic skull of a squamate showing the location of major dermal bones Extant reptiles are in the clade Diapsida, named for a pair of temporal fenestrations on each side of the skull. Until recently, Diapsida was said to be composed of Lepidosauria and their sister taxa Archosauria. The subclass Lepidosauria is then split into Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. More recent morphological studies and molecular studies or, more commonly, as a sister group to extant archosaurs. also place turtles firmly within Diapsida, even though they lack temporal fenestrations. The quadrate bone is particularly elongated in snakes, to facilitate cranial kinesis The group Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenians. Squamata can be characterized by the reduction or loss of limbs. Snakes, some lizards, and most amphisbaenians have evolved the complete loss of their limbs. The skin of all squamates is covered in scales. The upper jaw of Squamates is movable on the cranium, a configuration called kinesis. This is made possible by a loose connection between the quadrate and its neighboring bones. Without this, snakes would not be able consume prey that are much larger than themselves. However, the tuatara does not share this characteristic with the other Lepidosauria. Amphisbaenians are mostly legless like snakes, but are generally much smaller. Three species of amphisbaenians have kept reduced front limbs and these species are known for actively burrowing in the ground. Rhynchocephalia, which includes the tuatara and their extinct relatives, can presently only be found on some small islands off New Zealand. The tuatara has amphicoelous vertebrae, which means that the vertebrae are hollowed out at both ends. Tuataras also have the ability to autotomize their tails. A well-developed median or pineal eye is present on the top of the head (parietal region) and an additional row of upper teeth is located on the palatine bone. =Diagnosis= The foot of a skink, showing lepidosaurs' characteristic overlapping scales The reptiles in the subclass Lepidosauria can be distinguished from other reptiles by a variety of characteristics. First, the males have evolved a hemipenis instead of a single penis with erectile tissue that is found in crocodilians, birds, mammals, and turtles. The hemipenis can be found in the base of the tail. The tuatara has not fully evolved the hemipenis, but instead has shallow paired outpocketings of the posterior wall of the cloaca that have been determined to be precursors to the hemipenis. Second, most lepidosaurs have the ability to autotomize their tails. However, this trait has been lost on some recent species. In lizards, fracture planes are present within the vertebrae of the tail that allow for its removal. Some lizards have multiple fracture planes, while others just have a single fracture plane. The regrowth of the tail is not always complete and is made of a solid rod of cartilage rather than individual vertebrae. In snakes, the tail separates between vertebrae and some do not experience regrowth. Third, the scales in lepidosaurs are horny (keratinized) structures of the epidermis, allowing them to be shed collectively, contrary to the scutes seen in other reptiles. This is done in different cycles, depending on the species. However, lizards generally shed in flakes while snakes shed in one piece. Unlike scutes, lepidosaur scales will often overlap like roof tiles. Biology and ecology Python (top) and rattlesnake (bottom) featuring pit organs for infrared sensing. Red arrows indicating pit organs and black arrows pointing to the nostrils Squamates are represented by viviparous, ovoviviparous, and oviparous species. Viviparous means that the female gives birth to live young, Ovoviviparous means that the egg will develop inside the female's body and Oviparous means that the female lays eggs. A few species within Squamata have the ability to reproduce asexually. The tuatara lays eggs that are usually about one inch in length and which take about 14 months to incubate. While in the egg, the Squamata embryo develops an egg tooth on the premaxillary that helps the animal emerge from the egg. A reptile will increase three to twentyfold in length from hatching to adulthood. There are three main life history events that lepidosaurs reach: hatching/birth, sexual maturity, and reproductive senility. Most lepidosaurs rely on camouflage as one of their main defenses. Some species have evolved to blend in with their ecosystem, while others are able change their skin color to blend in with their current surroundings. The ability to autotomize the tail is another defense that is common among lepidosaurs. Other species, such as the Echinosauria, have evolved the defense of feigning death. =Hunting and diet= A green crested lizard feeding on an invertebrate Viperines can sense their prey's infrared radiation through bare nerve endings on the skin of their heads. Also, viperines and some boids have thermal receptors that allow them to target their prey's heat. Many snakes are able to obtain their prey through constriction. This is done by first biting the prey, then coiling their body around the prey. The snake then tightens its grip as the prey struggles, which leads to suffocation. Some snakes have fangs that produce venomous bites, which allows the snake to consume unconscious, or even dead, prey. Also, some venoms include a proteolytic component that aids in digestion. Chameleons grasp their prey with a projectile tongue. This is made possible by a hyoid mechanism, which is the contraction of the hyoid muscle that drives the tip of the tongue outwards. An eastern blue-tongued lizard preyed upon by an eastern brown snake Within the subclass Lepidosauria there are herbivores, omnivores, insectivores, and carnivores. The herbivores consist of iguanines, some agamids, and some skinks. Most lizard species and some snake species are insectivores. The remaining snake species, tuataras, and amphisbaenians, are carnivores. While some snake species are generalist, others eat a narrow range of prey - for example, Salvadora only eat lizards. The remaining lizards are omnivores and can consume plants or insects. The broad carnivorous diet of the tuatara may be facilitated by its specialised shearing mechanism, which involves a forward movement of the lower jaw following jaw closure. While birds, including raptors, wading birds and roadrunners, and mammals are known to prey on reptiles, the major predator is other reptiles. Some reptiles eat reptile eggs, for example the diet of the Nile monitor includes crocodile eggs, and small reptiles are preyed upon by larger ones. Conservation Global range of lizard species The geographic ranges of lepidosaurs are vast and cover all but the most extreme cold parts of the globe. Amphisbaenians exist in Florida, mainland Mexico, including Baja California, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, North Africa, sub- Saharan Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. The tuatara is confined to only a few rocky islands of New Zealand, where it digs burrows to live in and preys mostly on insects. Climate change has led to the need for conservation efforts to protect the existence of the tuatara. This is because it is not possible for this species to migrate on its own to cooler areas. Conservationists are beginning to consider the possibility of translocating them to islands with cooler climates. The range of the tuatara has already been minimized by the introduction of cats, rats, dogs, and mustelids to New Zealand. The eradication of the mammals from the islands where the tuatara still survives has helped the species increase its population. An experiment observing the tuatara population after the removal of the Polynesian rat showed that the tuatara expressed an island-specific increase of population after the rats' removal. However, it may be difficult to keep these small mammals from reinhabiting these islands. Habitat destruction is the leading negative impact of humans on reptiles. Humans continue to develop land that is important habitat for the lepidosaurs. The clear-cutting of land has also led to habitat reduction. Some snakes and lizards migrate toward human dwellings because there is an abundance of rodent and insect prey. However, these reptiles are seen as pests and are often exterminated. =Interactions with humans= diamondback rattlers Snakes are commonly feared throughout the world. Bounties were paid for dead cobras under the British Raj in India; similarly, there have been advertised rattlesnake roundups in North America. Data shows that between 1959 and 1986 an average of 5,563 rattlesnakes were killed per year in Sweetwater, Texas, due to rattlesnake roundups, and these roundups have led to documented declines and local extirpations of rattlesnake populations, especially Eastern Diamondbacks in Georgia. People have introduced species to the lepidosaurs' natural habitats that have increased predation on the reptiles. For example, mongooses were introduced to Jamaica from India to control the rat infestation in sugar cane fields. As a result, the mongooses fed on the lizard population of Jamaica, which has led to the elimination or decrease of many lizard species. Actions can be taken by humans to help endangered reptiles. Some species are unable to be bred in captivity, but others have thrived. There is also the option of animal refuges. This concept is helpful to contain the reptiles and keep them from human dwellings. However, environmental fluctuations and predatorial attacks still occur in refuges. Reptile skins are still being sold. Accessories, such as shoes, boots, purses, belts, buttons, wallets, and lamp shades, are all made out of reptile skin. In 1986, the World Resource Institute estimated that 10.5 million reptile skins were traded legally. This total does not include the illegal trades of that year. Horned lizards are popularly harvested and stuffed. Some humans are making a conscious effort to preserve the remaining species of reptiles, however.

In the ocean, marine organisms are estimated to produce 56,000 tonnes annually. It is also produced in small quantities by certain terrestrial plants, such as members of the family Brassicaceae.

Moreover, 75% of the consumption used to take place in developed nations, led by the United States (43%) and Europe (24%). Asia and the Middle East combined to use 24% whereas Latin America and Africa had the lowest usage at 9%. ISPM 15 markings on a pallet from China. The MB indicates the wood has been fumigated with methyl bromide to kill pests. Until its production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol, bromomethane was widely applied as a soil sterilant, mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as strawberriesStrawberries hang in the balance, CEN (June 8th, 2015) and almonds. In commercial large-scale monoculture seed production, unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with off-type seed of the same species. Therefore, selective herbicides cannot be used. Although bromomethane is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on soil steam sterilization, mechanical rogueing, and fallow seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. Bromomethane is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control Bermuda grass. The Montreal Protocol stipulates that bromomethane use be phased out. Bromomethane is also a precursor in the manufacture of other chemicals as a methylating agent. Bromomethane was once used in specialty fire extinguishers, prior to the advent of less toxic halons, as it is electrically non-conductive and leaves no residue. It was used primarily for electrical substations, military aircraft, and other industrial hazards. It was never as popular as other agents due to its high cost and toxicity. Bromomethane was used from the 1920s to the 1960s, and continued to be used in aircraft engine fire suppression systems into the late 1960s. A selection of stored-pressure bromomethane fire extinguishers, circa 1930s-40s, UK Regulation Bromomethane is readily photolyzed in the atmosphere to release bromine radicals, which are far more destructive to stratospheric ozone than chlorine. As such, it is subject to phase-out requirements of the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances. The London Amendment in 1990 added bromomethane to the list of ODS to be phased out. In 2003 the Global Environment Facility approved funds for a UNEP-UNDP joint project for methyl bromide total sector phase out in seven countries in Central Europe and Central Asia, which was due for completion in 2007. Alternatives Alternatives to bromomethane in the agricultural field are currently in use and further alternatives are in development, including propylene oxide and furfural. =Australia= In Australia, bromomethane is the preferred fumigant of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for most organic goods imported into Australia. The department conducts methyl bromide fumigation certification for both domestic and foreign fumigators who can then fumigate containers destined for Australia. A list of alternative fumigants is available for goods imported from Europe (in what's known as the BICON database), where methyl bromide fumigation has been banned. Alternatively, the department allows containers from Europe to be fumigated with methyl bromide on arrival to Australia. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, bromomethane is used as a fumigant for whole logs destined for export. Environmental groups and the Green Party oppose its use. In May 2011 the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) introduced new rules for its use which restrict the level of public exposure to the fumigant, set minimum buffer zones around fumigation sites, provide for notification to nearby residents and require users to monitor air quality during fumigations and report back to ERMA each year. All methyl bromide fumigations must use recapture technology by 2021. =United States= In the United States bromomethane is regulated as a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) and as a hazardous substance under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA; 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), and is subject to reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA; 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq.). The U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA; 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). A 1998 amendment (P.L. 105-178, Title VI) conformed the Clean Air Act phase out date with that of the Montreal Protocol.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905 Whereas the Montreal Protocol has severely restricted the use of bromomethane internationally, the United States has successfully lobbied for critical-use exemptions. Critical use exemptions allow the United States to continue using MeBr until it is scheduled to be completely phased out sometime in 2017. In 2004, over 7 million pounds of bromomethane were applied in California. Applications include tomato, strawberry, and ornamental shrub growers, and fumigation of ham/pork products. Also exempt is the treatment of solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing), and the packaged goods, being exported to ISPM 15 countries (to include Canada in 2012). =Chile= Has phased out the use in traditional agriculture on 2015, with exemption of the 100% pure formulation that is continued and largely used for quarantine pest control and at pre-shipments of the fruit export industry.Decision XVII/29: Non-compliance with the Montreal Protocol by Chile. United Nations Environment Programme Ozone Secretariat, http://montreal- protocol.org/publications/mp_handbook/Section_2_Decisions/Article_8/decs-non- compliance/Decision_XVII-29.shtml Health effects IR spectrum of bromomethane. Brief exposure to high concentrations and prolonged inhalation of lower concentrations are problematic.Muir, GD (ed.) 1971, Hazards in the Chemical Laboratory, The Royal Institute of Chemistry, London. Exposure levels leading to death vary from 1,600 to 60,000 ppm, depending on the duration of exposure (as a comparison exposure levels of 70 to 400 ppm of carbon monoxide cover the same spectrum of illness/death). Concentrations in the range of 60,000 ppm can be immediately fatal, while toxic effects can present following prolonged exposure to concentrations well under 1,000 ppm. \\"A TLV‚ÄìTWA of 1 ppm (3.89 mg/m3) is recommended for occupational exposure to methyl bromide\\"-ACGIH 8 hour time weighted average. Immediately Dangerous To Life or Health Concentration by NIOSH: \\"The revised IDLH for methyl bromide is 250 ppm based on acute inhalation toxicity data in humans [Clarke et al. 1945]. This may be a conservative value due to the lack of relevant acute toxicity data for workers exposed to concentrations above 220 ppm. [Note: NIOSH recommends as part of its carcinogen policy that the \\"most protective\\" respirators be worn for methyl bromide at any detectable concentration.]\\" Detectable concentration by Drager Tube is 0.5 ppm. Respiratory, kidney, and neurological effects are of the greatest concern. Treatment of wood packaging requires a concentration of up to 16,000 ppm. NIOSH considers methyl bromide to be a potential occupational carcinogen as defined by the OSHA carcinogen policy [29 CFR 1990]. \\"Methyl bromide showed a significant dose-response relationship with prostate cancer risk.\\" =Excessive exposure= Expression of toxicity following exposure may involve a latent period of several hours, followed by signs such as nausea, abdominal pain, weakness, confusion, pulmonary edema, and seizures. Individuals who survive the acute phase often require a prolonged convalescence. Persistent neurological deficits such as asthenia, cognitive impairment, optical atrophy, and paresthesia are frequently present after moderate to severe poisoning. Blood or urine concentrations of inorganic bromide, a bromomethane metabolite, are useful to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage.R.

Like other chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides, chlordane is classified as an organic pollutant hazardous for human health. It is resistant to degradation in the environment and in humans/animals and readily accumulates in lipids (fats) of humans and animals.Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (ATSDR). Toxic Substances Portal: Chlordane. Last updated September, 2010 [online]. Available at URL: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/substances/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=62 Exposure to the compound has been linked to cancers, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Production, composition and uses Technical chlordane development was by chance by Julius Hyman in 1948, during a search for possible uses of a by-product of synthetic rubber manufacturing. By chlorinating this by-product, persistent and potent insecticides were easily and cheaply produced. The chlorine atoms, 7 in the case of heptachlor and 8 in chlordane, and 9 in the case of nonachlor, surround and stabilize the cyclodiene ring and thus these compounds are referred to as cyclodienes. Other members of the cyclodiene family of organochlorine insecticides are aldrin and its epoxide, dieldrin, as well as endrin, which is a stereoisomer of dieldrin. Cyclodiene derives its name from hexachlorocyclopentadiene, a precursor in its production. Synthesis of cis- (above) and trans-chlordane (below) Hexachlorocyclopentadiene forms a Diels-Alder adduct with cyclopentadiene to give chlordene intermediate [3734-48-3]; chlorination of this adduct gives predominantly two chlordane isomers, Œ± and Œ≤, in addition to other products such as trans-nonachlor and heptachlor. The Œ≤-isomer is popularly known as gamma and is more bioactive. The mixture that is composed of 147 components is called technical chlordane. Cis-chlordane.svgcis-chlordane (also known as Œ±-chlordane (CAS=5103-71-9)) Trans-chlordane.svgtrans-chlordane (also known as Œ≥-chlordane and beta-chlordane (CAS=5103-74-2)) Trans-nonachlor.svgtrans- nonachlor (+)-Heptachlor.svg(+)-heptachlor Chlordane appears as a white or off-white crystals when synthesized, but it was more commonly sold in various formulations as oil solutions, emulsions, sprays, dusts, and powders. These products were sold in the United States from 1948 to 1988. Because of concern for harm to human health and to the environment, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned all uses of chlordane in 1983, except termite control in wooden structures (e.g. houses). After many reports of chlordane in the indoor air of treated homes, EPA banned the remaining use of chlordane in 1988.Pesticides and Breast Cancer Risk: Chlordane , Fact Sheet #11, March 1998, Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors Cornell University The EPA recommends that children should not drink water with more than 60 parts of chlordane per billion parts of drinking water (60 ppb) for longer than 1 day. EPA has set a limit in drinking water of 2 ppb. Chlordane is very persistent in the environment because it does not break down easily. Tests of the air in the residence of U.S. government housing, 32 years after chlordane treatment, showed levels of chlordane and heptachlor 10-15 times the Minimal Risk Levels (20 nanograms/cubic meter of air) published by the Centers for Disease Control. It has an environmental half-life of 10 to 20 years. Origin, pathways of exposure, and processes of excretion Sources and pathways that chlordane contaminates the indoor air of American homes In the years 1948-1988 chlordane was a common pesticide for corn and citrus crops, as well as a method of home termite control. Pathways of exposure to chlordane include ingestion of crops grown in chlordane-contaminated soil, inhalation of air in chlordane-treated homes and from landfills, and ingestion of high-fat foods such as meat, fish, and dairy, as chlordane builds up in fatty tissue.Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (ATSDR). ToxFaqs: September, 1995. Available at URL: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts31.pdf The United States Environmental Protection Agency reported that over 30 million homes were treated with technical chlordane or technical chlordane with heptachlor. Depending on the site of home treatment, the indoor air levels of chlordane can still exceed the Minimal Risks Levels (MRLs) for both cancer and chronic disease by orders of magnitude. Chlordane is excreted slowly through feces, urine elimination, and through breast milk in nursing mothers. It is able to cross the placenta and become absorbed by developing fetuses in pregnant women.Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals: Chemical Information: Chlordane. Last updated November, 2010 [online]. A breakdown product of chlordane, the metabolite oxychlordane, accumulates in blood and adipose tissue with age. Environmental impact Being hydrophobic, chlordane adheres to soil particles and enters groundwater only slowly, owing to its low solubility (0.009 ppm). It requires many years to degrade. Chlordane bioaccumulates in animals. It is highly toxic to fish, with an of 0.022‚Äì0.095 mg/kg (oral). Oxychlordane (C10H4Cl8O), the primary metabolite of chlordane, and heptachlor epoxide, the primary metabolite of heptachlor, along with the two other main components of the chlordane mixture, cis-nonachlor and trans-nonachlor, are the main bioaccumulating constituents. trans-Nonachlor is more toxic than technical chlordane and cis-nonachlor is less toxic. Chlordane and heptachlor are known as persistent organic pollutants (POP), classified among the \\"dirty dozen\\" and banned by the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.The 12 initial POPs under the Stockholm Convention Health effects Exposure to chlordane/heptachlor and/or its metabolites (oxychlordane, heptachlor epoxide) are risk factors for type-2 diabetes, for lymphoma, for prostate cancer, for obesity, for testicular cancer, for breast cancer. An epidemiological study conducted by the National Cancer Institute reported that higher levels of chlordane in dust on the floors of homes were associated with higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in occupants. Breathing chlordane in indoor air is the main route of exposure for these levels in human tissues. Currently, EPA has defined a concentration of 24 nanogram per cubic meter of air (ng/M3) for chlordane compounds over a 20-year exposure period as the concentration that will increase the probability of cancer by 1 in 1,000,000 persons. This probability of developing cancer increases to 10 in 1,000,000 persons with an exposure of 100 ng/m3 and 100 in 1,000,000 with an exposure of 1000 ng/m3.Chlordane (Technical) (CASRN 12789-03-6)  IRIS  US EPA The non-cancer health effects of chlordane compounds, which include diabetes, insulin resistance, migraines, respiratory infections, immune-system activation, anxiety, depression, blurry vision, confusion, intractable seizures as well as permanent neurological damage,ATSDR - Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Chlordane probably affects more people than cancer. Trans- nonachlor and oxychlordane in serum of mothers during gestation has been linked with behaviors associated with autism in offspring at age 4-5. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has defined a concentration of chlordane compounds of 20 ng/m3 as the Minimal Risk Level (MRLs). ATSDR defines Minimal Risk Level as an estimate of daily human exposure to a dose of a chemical that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse non-cancerous effects over a specific duration of exposure.ATSDR - Redirect - Toxicological Profile: Chlordane Remediation Chlordane was applied under the home/building during treatment for termites and the half-life can be up to 30 years. Chlordane has a low vapor pressure and volatilizes slowly into the air of home/building above. To remove chlordane from indoor air requires either ventilation (Heat Exchange Ventilation) or activated carbon filtration. Chemical remediation of chlordane in soils was attempted by the US Army Corps of Engineers by mixing chlordane with aqueous lime and persulfate. In a phytoremediation study, Kentucky bluegrass and Perennial ryegrass were found to be minimally affected by chlordane, and both were found to take it up into their roots and shoots. Mycoremediation of chlordane in soil have found that contamination levels were reduced. The fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been found to reduce concentrations of chlordane by 21% in water in 30 days and in solids in 60 days.

The combustion of 1,2-dibromoethane produces hydrogen bromide gas that is significantly corrosive. Preparation and use It is produced by the reaction of ethylene gas with bromine, in a classic halogen addition reaction: :CH=CH + Br ‚Üí BrCH‚ÄìCHBr Historically, 1,2-dibromoethane was used as a component in anti-knock additives in leaded fuels. It reacts with lead residues to generate volatile lead bromides, thereby preventing fouling of the engine with lead deposits. =Pesticide= It has been used as a pesticide in soil and on various crops. The applications were initiated after the forced retirement of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP). Most of these uses have been stopped in the U.S. It continues to be used as a fumigant for treatment of logs for termites and beetles, for control of moths in beehives. =Reagent= 1,2-Dibromoethane has wider applications in the preparation of other organic compounds including those carrying modified diazocine rings and vinyl bromide that is a precursor to some fire retardants. In organic synthesis, 1,2-dibromoethane is used as a source of bromine to brominate carbanions and to activate magnesium for certain Grignard reagents. In the latter process, 1,2-dibromoethane reacts with magnesium, producing ethylene and magnesium bromide, and exposes a freshly etched portion of magnesium to the substrate. Health effects 1,2-Dibromoethane causes changes in the metabolism and severe destruction of living tissues. The known empirical LD50 values for 1,2-dibromoethane are 140 mg kg‚àí1 (oral, rat), and 300.0 mg kg‚àí1 (dermal, rabbit). 1,2-Dibromoethane is a known carcinogen, with pre-1977 exposure levels ranking it as the most carcinogenic substance on the HERP Index. The effects on people of breathing high levels are not known, but animal studies with short-term exposures to high levels caused depression and collapse, indicating effects on the brain. Changes in the brain and behavior were also seen in young rats whose male parents had breathed 1,2-dibromoethane, and birth defects were observed in the young of animals that were exposed while pregnant. 1,2-Dibromoethane is not known to cause birth defects in humans.

Its combustion affords sulfur dioxide according to this ideal stoichiometry: :CS2 \\\\+ 3O2 ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 2SO2 =With nucleophiles= Compared to the isoelectronic carbon dioxide, CS2 is a weaker electrophile. While, however, reactions of nucleophiles with CO2 are highly reversible and products are only isolated with very strong nucleophiles, the reactions with CS2 are thermodynamically more favored allowing the formation of products with less reactive nucleophiles.

Trithiocarbonate (-S-C(S)-S-) linkages comprise, in part, the backbone of the polymer, which is a semiconductor. Uses The principal industrial uses of carbon disulfide, consuming 75% of the annual production, are the manufacture of viscose rayon and cellophane film. It is also a valued intermediate in chemical synthesis of carbon tetrachloride. It is widely used in the synthesis of organosulfur compounds such as metam sodium, xanthates, dithiocarbamates, which are used in extractive metallurgy and rubber chemistry. =Niche uses= It can be used in fumigation of airtight storage warehouses, airtight flat storages, bins, grain elevators, railroad box cars, shipholds, barges and cereal mills.

It is a colorless, pyrophoric gas with a repulsively sweet odor. Synonyms include boroethane, boron hydride, and diboron hexahydride. Diborane is a key boron compound with a variety of applications. It has attracted wide attention for its electronic structure. Its derivatives are useful reagents.  Structure and bonding  Bonding diagram of diborane (B2H6) showing with curved lines a pair of three-center two-electron bonds, each of which consists of a pair of electrons bonding three atoms, two boron atoms and a hydrogen atom in the middle. The structure of diborane has D2h symmetry. Four hydrides are terminal, while two bridge between the boron centers. The lengths of the B-Hbridge bonds and the B-Hterminal bonds are 1.33 and 1.19 √Ö, respectively. This difference in bond lengths reflects the difference in their strengths, the B-Hbridge bonds being relatively weaker. The weakness of the B-Hbridge vs B-Hterminal bonds is indicated by their vibrational signatures in the infrared spectrum, being ‚âà2100 and 2500 cm‚àí1, respectively. The model determined by molecular orbital theory describes the bonds between boron and the terminal hydrogen atoms as conventional 2-center, 2-electron covalent bonds. The bonding between the boron atoms and the bridging hydrogen atoms is, however, different from that in molecules such as hydrocarbons. Each boron uses two electrons in bonding to the terminal hydrogen atoms, and has one valence electron remaining for additional bonding. The bridging hydrogen atoms provide one electron each. The B2H2 ring is held together by four electrons which form two 3-center 2-electron bonds. This type of bond is sometimes called a 'banana bond'. B2H6 is isoelectronic with C2H62+, which would arise from the diprotonation of the planar molecule ethylene. Diborane is one of many compounds with such unusual bonding. Of the other elements in Group IIIA, gallium is known to form a similar compound, digallane, Ga2H6. Aluminium forms a polymeric hydride, (AlH3)n, although unstable Al2H6 has been isolated in solid hydrogen and is isostructural with diborane.  Production and synthesis  Extensive studies of diborane have led to the development of multiple syntheses. Most preparations entail reactions of hydride donors with boron halides or alkoxides. The industrial synthesis of diborane involves the reduction of BF3 by sodium hydride, lithium hydride or lithium aluminium hydride: :8 BF3 \\\\+ 6 LiH ‚Üí B2H6 \\\\+ 6 LiBF4 Two laboratory methods start from boron trichloride with lithium aluminium hydride or from boron trifluoride ether solution with sodium borohydride. Both methods result in as much as 30% yield: :4 BCl3 \\\\+ 3 LiAlH4 ‚Üí 2 B2H6 \\\\+ 3 LiAlCl4 :4 BF3 \\\\+ 3 NaBH4 ‚Üí 2 B2H6 \\\\+ 3 NaBF4 Older methods entail the direct reaction of borohydride salts with a non-oxidizing acid, such as phosphoric acid or dilute sulfuric acid. :2 BH4‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ ‚Üí 2 H2 \\\\+ B2H6 Similarly, oxidation of borohydride salts has been demonstrated and remains convenient for small scale preparations. For example, using iodine as an oxidizer: :2 + ‚Üí 2 NaI + + Another small-scale synthesis uses potassium hydroborate and phosphoric acid as starting materials.  Reactions  Diborane is a highly reactive and versatile reagent. Its dominating reaction pattern involves formation of adducts with Lewis bases. Often such initial adducts proceed rapidly to give other products. It reacts with ammonia to form the diammoniate of diborane, DADB, with lesser quantities of ammonia borane depending on the conditions used. Diborane also reacts readily with alkynes to form substituted alkene products which will readily undergo further addition reactions. As a pyrophoric substance, diborane reacts exothermically with oxygen to form boron trioxide and water, so much that it was considered as a possible rocket or ramjet propellant but discarded because back then it was too expensive and dangerous to handle: : 2 B2H6 \\\\+ 6 O2 ‚Üí 2 B2O3 \\\\+ 6 H2O (ŒîHr = ‚Äì2035 kJ/mol = ‚Äì73.47 kJ/g) Diborane also reacts violently with water to form hydrogen and boric acid: : B2H6 \\\\+ 6 H2O ‚Üí 2 B(OH)3 \\\\+ 6 H2 (ŒîHr = ‚Äì466 kJ/mol = ‚Äì16.82 kJ/g) Diborane also reacts with methanol to give hydrogen and trimethoxyborate ester: : B2H6 \\\\+ 6 MeOH ‚Üí 2 B(OMe)3 \\\\+ 6 H2 Treating diborane with sodium amalgam gives NaBH4 and Na[B3H8] When diborane is treated with lithium hydride in diethyl ether, Lithium borohydride is formed: : B2H6 \\\\+ 2 LiH ‚Üí 2 LiBH4 Diborane reacts with anhydrous hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide gas to give a boron halohydride: : B2H6 \\\\+ HX ‚Üí B2H5X + H2 (X = Cl, Br) Treating diborane with carbon monoxide at 470 K and 20 bar gives H3BCO.  Reagent in organic synthesis  Diborane and its variants are central organic synthesis reagents for hydroboration, whereby alkenes add across the B-H bonds to give trialkylboranes. Diborane is used as a reducing agent roughly complementary to the reactivity of lithium aluminium hydride. The compound readily reduces carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohols, whereas ketones react only sluggishly.  History  Diborane was first synthesised in the 19th century by hydrolysis of metal borides, but it was never analysed. From 1912 to 1936, the major pioneer in the chemistry of boron hydrides, Alfred Stock, undertook his research that led to the methods for the synthesis and handling of the highly reactive, volatile, and often toxic boron hydrides. He proposed the first ethane-like structure of diborane. Electron diffraction measurements by S. H. Bauer initially appeared to support his proposed structure. Because of a personal communication with L. Pauling (who supported the ethane-like structure), H. I. Schlessinger and A. B. Burg did not specifically discuss 3-center-2-electron bonding in their then classic review in the early 1940s. The review does, however, discuss the bridged D2h structure in some depth, \\"It is to be recognized that this formulation easily accounts for many of the chemical properties of diborane...\\" In 1943, Longuet- Higgins, while still an undergraduate at Oxford, was the first to explain the structure and bonding of the boron hydrides. The paper reporting the work, written with his tutor R. P. Bell, also reviews the history of the subject beginning with the work of Dilthey. Shortly afterwards, the theoretical work of Longuet-Higgins was confirmed in an infrared study of diborane by Price. The structure was re-confirmed by electron diffraction measurement in 1951 by K. Hedberg and V. Schomaker, with the confirmation of the structure shown in the schemes on this page. William Nunn Lipscomb, Jr. further confirmed the molecular structure of boranes using X-ray crystallography in the 1950s, and developed theories to explain their bonding. Later, he applied the same methods to related problems, including the structure of carboranes on which he directed the research of future 1981 Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffmann. The 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Lipscomb \\"for his studies on the structure of boranes illuminating problems of chemical bonding\\". Traditionally, diborane has often been described as electron-deficient, because the 12 valence electrons can only form 6 conventional 2-centre 2-electron bonds which are insufficient to join all 8 atoms. However the more correct description using 3-centre bonds shows that diborane is really electron-precise, since there are just enough valence electrons to fill the 6 bonding molecular orbitals. Nevertheless, some leading textbooks still use the term electron-deficient.  Other uses  Diborane has been tested as a rocket propellant. Complete combustion is strongly exothermic. However, combustion is not complete in the rocket engine, as some boron monoxide, B2O, is produced. This mirrors the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, to produce carbon monoxide, CO. Diborane has been used as a rubber vulcaniser, as a catalyst for hydrocarbon polymerisation, as a flame-speed accelerator, and as a doping agent for the production of semiconductors. It is also an intermediate in the production of highly pure boron for semiconductor production. It is also used to coat the walls of tokamaks to reduce the amount of heavy metal impurities in the core plasma.  Safety  The toxic effects of diborane are primarily due to its irritant properties. Short-term exposure to diborane can cause a sensation of tightness of the chest, shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. These signs and symptoms can occur immediately or be delayed for up to 24 hours. Skin and eye irritation can also occur. Studies in animals have shown that diborane causes the same type of effects observed in humans. People exposed for a long time to low amounts of diborane have experienced respiratory irritation, seizures, fatigue, drowsiness, confusion, and occasional transient tremors.

The city is located on the coast in Ferrol Bay, 130 km south of Trujillo and north of Lima on the North Pan-American highway. It is the start of a chain of important cities on the Peruvian north coast like Trujillo, Chiclayo and Piura. The advantages of this geographic location made Chimbote into a transshipment junction for the Santa River valley. History In 1835, when General Santa Cruz granted Chimbote's first official acknowledgement, Chimbote was a village of fishermen with a population of no more than 800. In 1871, an agreement was made with Henry Meiggs to build a railroad towards the interior of the country. Chimbote was classified as a port, even though its population remained around 1,000. The opening of the Pan-American Highway created easy access to Lima in the 1930s. In 1881, there was an attempt to cede a naval base to the U.S. in Chimbote Bay by Peru. The deal was blocked by Chile who sent its marines to occupy Chimbote after learning of the deal to cede a naval base to the U.S. Navy. In 1940, Chimbote was still a small fishing port, with only 2,400 inhabitants in an urbanized area of . In 1943, the government created the Corporaci√≥n Peruana del Santa (Peruvian Corporation of Santa). This entity assumed ownership of the railroad, made improvements to the port, and began work on a hydroelectric power station on the R√≠o Santa (in the Ca√±√≥n del Pato [Duck Canyon] in Huallanca). The first stage of the power station was inaugurated in 1958; also that year, an iron and steel plant was built.The iron and steel plant is currently known as Empresa Sider√∫rgica del Per√∫ S.A.A. By 1943, the first companies dedicated to the extraction of liver from the Pacific bonito fish arrived. This liver was sold for a high price abroad due to World War II.  Geography  = Climate = Chimbote's climate is comfortable, despite being located in the tropics and in a desert. Although classified as subtropical, Chimbote's proximity to the cool Humboldt current leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a tropical desert, and is classified as a desert climate. On average, the warmest month is February with temperatures a little over . September is considered the average coolest month, at around . The annual average temperature is around 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). The city gets little to no precipitation; however, thick fog predominates through the months of May to November, usually overnight. Rainfall usually comes in February. Population Satellite image of Chimbote A large number of people migrated to Chimbote in the early 1970s. By that time, less than 5 percent of the people from Chimbote would truly consider themselves native; between 1960 and 1970, Chimbote's population multiplied by more than a hundred times. In 1900, the population of the port was 1,400; after 1970, it was 170,000. As of 2005, its population was 324,398. The influx of residents was closely bound to the creation of the Corporaci√≥n Peruana del Santa, to the start and development of the fishing industry, and to the establishment of the iron and steel plant (\\"Siderperu\\"). Together, these multiplied the commercial and productive activities of the port. At the beginning of 1996, as Peruvian public companies were privatized, the Peruvian-Brazilian company Acerco bought Siderperu. =Districts and neighborhoods= The city of Chimbote, being a district itself, comprises 7 more districts: Santa, Coishco, Samanco, Nepe√±a, Macate, Moro, C√°ceres del Per√∫, and Nuevo Chimbote. The neighborhoods of El Barrio de Acero, Barrio Bolivar, El Progreso, Miraflores Alto and Miraflores Bajo surround Chimbote. Economy During the 1970s, the El Ni√±o climate pattern, an earthquake, and overfishing drastically affected the fishing industry, and restrictions were imposed to ensure its survival. More than 75 percent of Peru's fishing industry is based in Chimbote. Chimbote is the largest fishing port in the world.https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and- analysis/articles/2016/01/05/new-analysis-identifies-worlds-largest-and- busiest-fishing-ports Chimbote has more than 30 fish factories. Chimbote's active commerce and its diversified industrial development are characteristic of the city. Its population includes workers who have experience in fishing, naval, canning, and the iron-and-steel industry with the company SIDERPERU. Chimbote also has beaches that support tourism. =Peruvian anchoveta \\"boom\\"= Shortly after the fish canning industry declined, the industrialization of anchoveta fishing peaked. This attracted people from all over Peru, due to the high wages paid in the fishing industry at the time, fueling Chimbote's suburban growth. The strong migratory wave toward the city increased because of the serious crisis of the countryside in the 1960s, particularly in Ancash, Cajamarca and the northern part of La Libertad Region. The axis of development moved from the Pima cotton, sugarcane, and rice plantations to the large city. In addition, Chimbote was a natural exit channel for the exports of the Santa valley, and a starting point for the entry to the Callej√≥n de Huaylas. The Peruvian anchoveta boom created wealth in the city, but it soon ended due to indiscriminate fishing that overwhelmed the bio-mass. An earthquake in 1970 damaged to the facilities of the fishing industries, causing unemployment and impoverishment. During this period, the Diocese of Chimbote created the Social Welfare Commission, to organize diverse popular dining places in conjunction with UNICEF. Since the 1960s, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh has served the poor at the Chimbote Mission, raising funds through the Chimbote Foundation. Tourism Chimbote is surrounded by two natural bays, the Bay of Chimbote (or Ferrol) and the Bay of Samanco, both with excellent harbor conditions. Chimbote forms a conurbation with Nuevo Chimbote District to the south. Between these districts, the Humedales de Villa Mar√≠a, a swamp, is home to a local species of heron, along with many species of frogs and fish. The swamp is formed by the Lacramarca River. To the south of the city, there are many beaches, such as Vesique, Los Chim√∫s, Tortugas, Caleta Colorada and el Dorado. Also located near Chimbote is the Isla Blanca (white isle, in English), which takes its name from the white color of the ground. Isla Blanca measures approximately in length and in width, and reaches above sea level. Located next to the city is the Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth), also called Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace). Since 1985, this tourist attraction attracts hundreds annually. Visitors appreciate a panoramic view of Chimbote's bay from the top of this mountain. Tourists can also visit Isla Blanca Boulevard, which has many beautiful marble sculptures and fountains. Cross at the top of Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth) aka Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace) From Chimbote, some short tourist circuits can be taken: * Chimbote - Casma - Sech√≠n - Yaut√°n * Chimbote - Nepe√±a - San Jacinto - Moro -Jimbe * Chimbote - Santa - Huallanca The city is known for its ceviche, a popular Peruvian dish whose ingredients include white fish, octopus, seashell, squid, crab, and red hot pepper. View of the city of Chimbote from the Cerro de la Paz. Festivals Chimbote has two important celebrations during the year: Holy Week and The Festivity of San Pedrito of Chimbote (also called Chimbote's Civic Anniversary). *Patronal feast of San Pedrito, this festival has its origins in the 16th century with the first fishermen who populated Chimbote coming from Huanchaco. It is held from 23 to 30 June in devotion to the patron saint of fishermen San Pedro. The central feast day is on 29 June, the image of the saint is taken out in procession and It is paraded through the bay by boat. Education The Academia Preuniversitaria \\"Perpetuo Socorro\\" and the Catholic University Los Angeles of Chimbote are located in Chimbote. Transportation The Chimbote-Huallanca rail line, built in 1922, serves as a railway for coal and iron mines on the interior and a railway for the river valley by transporting rice, cotton, sugarcane, and bananas. =Bus terminal= El Chimbador Bus Terminal is Chimbote's primary ground transportation facility. The bus terminal is located outside of the city. It has become a vital connection for the region's workers, travelers and visitors, serving nearly 6,000 passengers a day. Currently there are 30 bus carriers offering services for national and international travel. =Port= The port of Chimbote is considered by some one of the most beautiful and safest ports in the Peruvian coast. It extends , from Caleta Colorada Bay (Red Creek Bay) in the north, where the present marine facilities are located, to Anconcillo in the south. =Airport= The city is served by the Teniente FAP Jaime Montreuil Morales Airport, operated by CORPAC S.A. It was created in 1957 under the government of President Manuel Prado Ugarteche. There are regular flights to Lima by LC Busre.

The conclusion of this stage may be assigned to approximately 9000 BP (there are differences in opinion between sources which recognize the classification), and the transition to the succeeding Archaic period is not a well-defined one. Its starting-point is a matter for some contention, as is the more general question of when human habitation in the Americas was first achieved. It is accepted by a significant number of researchers that the peopling of the Americas had occurred by c. 11,200 years ago. History =Migration= Scientific opinion regarding human antiquity in Mesoamerica has reflected larger trends in conceptualizing human antiquity in the western hemisphere in general. Within that foundational topic, the establishment of sites demonstrating human antiquity in Mesoamerica has centered on the association of remains and artifacts with geologic strata (context) and on the reliability of the dating of the remains and strata (methodologies). At the beginning of the twentieth century, humans were believed to be very recent post-glacial immigrants to the western hemisphere. Although there was believed to have been anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 years of post-glacial time in which such immigration could have occurred over the Bering land bridge, the antiquity of human presence in the western hemisphere was popularly fixed at about 5,000 BP (\\"before present\\", or 3000 BC).Obsidian projectile point from Puerta Parada, Guatemala William H. Holmes and Ales Hrdlicka led this school of thought. The Folsom and Clovis discoveries of the 1920s and 1930s revised the minimum time frame for the initial occupation of the New World. The Folsom lithics dated to 10,000‚Äì11,000 BP, and the Clovis lithics dated to 12,000‚Äì12,500 BP, allowing for an original immigration date of about 14,000 BP. =Lithic period= In Mesoamerica, the period from about 9,000 BP back to the earliest occupations is referred to as the \\"Paleoindian period.\\" Evidence of human occupation in Mesoamerica consistent with that 14,000 BP original occupation date has been presented, debated, and accepted. Fluted points have been found north of Mesoamerica in the states of Sonora and Durango as well as in central Mexico, with proof of a mammoth hunt being uncovered at Santa Isabel Iztapan. Pleistocene-age bone artifacts have been found at Los Reyes La Paz. Human presence during this period has been further documented by cranial finds at Pe√±a, Xico, Tepexpan, Santa Maria Astahuacan, and San Vicente Chicoloapan. A variety of methods were used to determine the antiquity of the cranial remains, including chemical bone analysis (nitrogen and fluorine tests), geological analysis (stratigraphic, carbon-14, and volcanic ash composition tests), contextual association with faunal remains, and contextual association with lithic artifacts dated by obsidian hydration. The 14,000 BP immigration date maximum, however, has been challenged. Claims have been made for human presence in the 20,000‚Äì30,000 BP timeframe at Pennsylvania's Meadowcroft Rock Shelter and in California's Yuha Desert as well as sites in South America, Central America, and Mesoamerica. A bone artifact from Tequixquiac may come from a pre-projectile point horizon. Evidence from Tlapacoya suggests human occupation dating to 23,000 BP. Valsequillo has five sites that appear to date from at least 20,000 BP. Based upon increasing evidence for an earlier antiquity for human presence in the western hemisphere, in 1976 Irving Rouse and Richard MacNeish independently published proposals revising western hemisphere lithic stages, allowing for human occupation as early as 30,000 BP and leaving open the possibility of an even earlier initial arrival.

It is a colorless gas with a distinctive putrid smell. It is a natural substance found in the blood, brain and feces of animals (including humans), as well as in plant tissues. It also occurs naturally in certain foods, such as some nuts and cheese. It is one of the chemical compounds responsible for bad breath and the smell of flatus. Methanethiol is the simplest thiol and is sometimes abbreviated as MeSH. It is very flammable. Structure and reactions The molecule is tetrahedral at carbon, like methanol. It is a weak acid, with a pKa of ~10.4, but is about a million times more acidic than methanol. The colorless salt can be obtained in this way: :CH3SH + CH3ONa ‚Üí CH3SNa + CH3OH The resulting thiolate anion is a strong nucleophile. It can be oxidized to dimethyl disulfide: :2CH3SH + [O] ‚Üí CH3SSCH3 \\\\+ H2O Further oxidation takes the disulfide to two molecules of methanesulfonic acid, which is odorless. Bleach deodorizes methanethiol in this way. Occurrence Methanethiol (MeSH) is released as a by-product of kraft pulping in pulp mills. In kraft pulping, lignin is depolymerized by nucleophilic attack with the strongly nucleophilic hydrosulfide ion (HS‚àí) in a highly alkaline medium. However, in a side reaction, HS‚àí attacks methoxyl groups (OMe) in lignin, demethylating them to give free phenolate groups (PhO‚àí) and releasing MeSH. Due to alkalinity, MeSH is readily deprotonated (MeSNa), and the formed MeS‚àí ion is also a strong nucleophile, reacting further to dimethyl sulfide. The compounds remain in the liquor and are burned in the recovery boiler, where the sulfur is recovered as sodium sulfide.Sixta, H.; Potthast, A.; Krotschek, A. W., Chemical Pulping Processes. In Handbook of Pulp, Sixta, H., Ed. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.: Weinheim, 2006; Vol. 1, p 169 (109-510). Methanethiol is released from decaying organic matter in marshes and is present in the natural gas of certain regions, in coal tar, and in some crude oils. It occurs in various plants and vegetables, such as radishes. In surface seawater, methanethiol is the primary breakdown product of the algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Marine bacteria appear to obtain most of the sulfur in their proteins by the breakdown of DMSP and incorporation of methanethiol, despite the fact that methanethiol is present in seawater at much lower concentrations than sulfate (~0.3 nM vs. 28 mM). Bacteria in environments both with and without oxygen can also convert methanethiol to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), although most DMS in surface seawater is produced by a separate pathway. Both DMS and methanethiol can be used by certain microbes as substrates for methanogenesis in some anaerobic soils. Methanethiol is a byproduct of the metabolism of asparagus.Richer, Decker, Belin, Imbs, Montastruc, Giudicelli: \\"Odorous urine in man after asparagus\\", British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, May 1989 The production of methanethiol in urine after eating asparagus was once thought to be a genetic trait. More recent research suggests that the peculiar odor is in fact produced by all humans after consuming asparagus, while the ability to detect it (methanethiol being one of many components in \\"asparagus pee\\") is in fact the genetic trait. The chemical components responsible for the change in the odor of urine show as soon as 15 minutes after eating asparagus.Skinny On: Discovery Channel Preparation Methanethiol is prepared commercially by the reaction of methanol with hydrogen sulfide gas over an aluminum oxide catalyst: :CH3OH + H2S ‚Üí CH3SH + H2O Although impractical, it can be prepared by the reaction of methyl iodide with thiourea. Uses Cylinder of methanethiol gas Methanethiol is mainly used to produce the essential amino acid methionine, which is used as a dietary component in poultry and animal feed. Methanethiol is also used in the plastic industry as a moderator for free-radical polymerizations and as a precursor in the manufacture of pesticides. This chemical is also used in the natural gas industry as an odorant, as it mixes well with methane. The characteristic \\"rotten eggs\\" smell of the mix is widely known by natural gas customers as an indicator of a possible gas leak, even a very minor one.SafeGase: About Natural Gas: Safety The safety data sheet (SDS) lists methanethiol as a colorless, flammable gas with an extremely strong and repulsive smell. At very high concentrations it is highly toxic and affects the central nervous system. Its penetrating odor provides warning at dangerous concentrations. An odor threshold of 1 ppb has been reported. The United States OSHA Ceiling Limit is listed as 10 ppm.

History The company was founded in 1934 as a subsidiary of the ship and machine company Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG (DESCHIMAG). It began production that year at Berlin Tempelhof, and in Bremen. In 1935, Dr. Adolf Rohrbach became technical director of a new Weserflug factory at Lemwerder, near Bremen, which opened in 1936. He had been working on ideas for VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft since 1933, and now developed them further. In 1938, the company developed the Weserflug P.1003, a VTOL aircraft. It had 4 m diameter propellers that swivelled between horizontal and vertical, and could fly up to 650 km/h. It requires very complex gearing to tilt the wings without varying the power to the propellers, and therefore was never built. =World War II= During World War II Weserflug had another factory in Liegnitz. It built Ju 188 and Ju 388 bombers, one of which survives in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. Perhaps foreseeing the end of the war, the management of Weserflug transferred in 1944 from Berlin to Hoykenkamp, 15 km west of Bremen. It took over buildings previously used by Focke Achgelis.F.-Herbert Wenz: Flughafen Tempelhof. Chronik des Berliner Werkes der \\"Weser\\" Flugzeugbau GmbH Bremen.

This plant also constructed Fw 190 fighters. Forced labour was used; on 20 April 1944 2,103 of the 4,151 Tempelhof workers were foreign forced labourers. Ju 86 aircraft were manufactured at Lemwerder. =After the war= At the end of the war, all aircraft production in Germany halted for several years. In 1948 a trustee, Horst Janson, was appointed to collect the assets of Weser AG, to which Weserflug belonged. He was responsible for some postwar reindustrialization in Bremen, such as reactivating the shipbuilding industry, and joined the board of Weser AG. Production of motorized aircraft was forbidden in Germany from 1945 until 1955. In the 1950s the Hoykenkamp area was used for small businesses. In 1960, while retaining his other commitments to the reindustrialisation of Bremen, Janson became chairman of Weser AG. In 1961, Weserflug joined forces with Focke-Wulf - also of Bremen - and Hamburger Flugzeugbau in the Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO) to develop rockets. Focke-Wulf and Weserflug formally merged in 1964, becoming Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW). Janson retired as chairman of Weser AG in 1969.

The study was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Merck and enrolled 4,444 people from 94 centres in Scandinavia. Before the 4S study, it was not proven that lowering cholesterol could prolong life in people who had CHD. The study concluded that secondary prevention with simvastatin in a high risk group with CHD reduced overall mortality by 30%. Published in The Lancet in 1994, it is considered a \\"landmark paper\\". Objective The 4S multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 4,444 people chosen from 7,027 people who had been followed up for two months after being given dietary advice. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of a cholesterol-lowering drug called simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in people with a history of a previous heart attack or angina, who also had a moderately raised cholesterol; between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/L. A second objective was to investigate whether the incidence of major coronary artery disease events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) could be reduced with simvastatin. Study details The participants, all at high risk of death from CHD and death in general, were selected from 94 clinical centers in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1988 to 1989, and were aged between 35 and 70 years, with the average age being 59. Of the 4,444 people enrolled in the study, 3,617 were men and 827 women, 2,223 were randomly assigned a placebo and 2,221 were given 20 to 40 mg of simvastatin daily. The plan was to follow the participants for a minimum of three years or until such a time as total mortality reached 440 deaths. In practice, the study carried for a median period of 5.4 years. Results Atheroma blocking an artery lumen After 5.4 years, compared to the group that were given placebo, the simvastatin group demonstrated a 35% reduction in LDL-C and 30% reduction in overall mortality. The risk of hospital-verified non-fatal myocardial infarction reduced by 37% and fatal and non-fatal cerebrovascular events (stroke and TIA) lessened by 28%. 30 people would need to be treated with simvastatin to prevent one death; number needed to treat around 30. There were no extra deaths from other non-cardiac causes such as cancer or trauma. The trial also showed benefits in diabetes, women and older people. A follow-up of treatment with simvastatin for up to eight years was published in 2000. Ten years after the start of the 4S trial, a follow-up study published on 28 August 2004 in The Lancet, revealed that of those 2,221 people who continued to take simvastatin, there was a further reduction in number of deaths from CHD when compared to those who had switched from placebo to statin at the five year mark. The overall mortality also reduced by 15% at the 10 year mark. Conclusion The study concluded that secondary prevention with simvastatin in a high risk group with CHD reduced overall mortality by 30%. Non-fatal CHD events and fatal and non-fatal cerebrovascular events were reduced without an increase in risk of cancer. Response Published in The Lancet in 1994, the 4S trial, had an immediate influence on medical opinion, and is considered a \\"landmark paper\\".

A great variety of genres in Malaysian music reflects the specific cultural groups within multiethnic Malaysian society: Malay, Chinese, Indian, Dayak, Kadazan-Dusun, Bajau, Orang Asli, Melanau, Kristang and others. In general, music of Malaysia may be categorised as classical, folk, syncretic (or acculturated music), popular and contemporary art music. Classical and folk music emerged during the pre-colonial period and exists in the form of vocal, dance and theatrical music such as Nobat, Mak Yong, Mak Inang, Dikir barat, Ulek mayang and Menora. The syncretic music developed during the post-Portuguese period (16th century) and contains elements from both local music and foreign elements of Arabian, Persian, Indian, Chinese and Western musical and theatrical sources. Among genres of this music are Zapin, Ghazal, Dondang Sayang, Mata-kantiga, Joget, Jikey, Boria and Bangsawan. Both Malaysian popular music and contemporary art music are essentially Western-based music combined with some local elements. In 1950s, the musician P. Ramlee helped in creating a Malaysian music that combined folks songs with Western dance rhythms and western Asian music. Ethnic traditions Besides Malay music, Chinese and Indian Malaysians have their own forms of music, and the indigenous tribes of Peninsula and East Malaysia have unique traditional instruments. =Malay music= Traditional Malay music spans from music for various theatrical forms such as wayang kulit, bangsawan and dance dramas as well as story-telling, to folk songs and music for dances, royal ceremonies, martial arts (silat), life cycle events, and religious occasions. Many forms of traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region with influence from India, China, Thailand and Indonesia. The music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums, including kompang and hadrah drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments are often made from natural materials. Besides drums, other percussion instruments (some made of shells) include: the rebab (a bowed string instrument), the serunai (a double- reed oboe-like instrument), the seruling (flute), and trumpets. Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and times like harvest. It was once used as a form of long-distance communication. In East Malaysia, gong-based musical ensemble such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings. These ensembles are also common in neighbouring regions such as in the southern Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia and Brunei. Malays playing gongs The Malays of Kelantan and Terengganu are culturally linked to peoples from the South China Sea area, and are quite different from the West Coast of Malaya. The martial art of silat Melayu developed in the Malay peninsula since the beginning of common eraThesis: Seni Silat Melayu by Abd Rahman Ismail (USM 2005 matter 188) also popular in Malaysia, while essentially still important as a branch of the self-defence form. Similar to t'ai chi, though of independent origin, it is a mix of martial arts, dance and music typically accompanied by gongs, drums and Indian oboes. The natives of the Malay Peninsula played in small ensembles called kertok, which performed swift and rhythmic xylophone music. This may have led to the development of dikir barat. In recent years, the Malaysian government has promoted this Kelantanese music form as a national cultural icon.Malaysian Ministry of Information Portal. \\"National Dikir Barat Competition To Be Expanded Next Year\\" , 2006. Retrieved on 30 January 2009. Johor art performances such as Zapin and Hamdolok as well as musical instruments including Gambus and Samrah have apparent Arab and Persian influences.Folk dance with religious origin, 14 April 2005, Peggy Loh, Travel Times, New Straits Times Arabic-derived zapin music and dance is popular throughout Malaysia, and is usually accompanied by a gambus and some drums. Ghazals from Arabia are popular in the markets and malls of Kuala Lumpur and Johor, and stars like Kamariah Noor are very successful. In Malacca, ronggeng is the dominant form of folk music. It played with a violin, drums, guitar, bass, synthesizer, button accordion and a gong instrument. Another style, Dondang Sayang is slow and intense; it mixes influences from China, India, Arabia, and Portugal with traditional elements. =Chinese music= The Hua Yue Tuan (Âçé‰πêÂõ¢), or \\"Chinese orchestra,\\" is made up of traditional Chinese musical instruments and some Western instruments. The music itself combines western polyphony with Chinese melodies and scales. Although the bulk of its repertoire consists of music originated from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, many local Chinese orchestras also regularly perform Malay folk tunes with various local composers making a definite effort to absorb elements of surrounding musical cultures, especially Malay, into their compositions. In Malaysia, Chinese orchestras exist nationwide in urban areas which have large concentrations of Chinese Malaysians. Sponsored largely by various Chinese organisations including schools, clan associations and Buddhist societies, a typical orchestra consists of between 12 and 50 members. The orchestra is usually made up of four sections: bowed string instruments, plucked strings, the wind section, and percussion. Also commonly found are percussion troupes with drums, gongs and cymbals that provide rhythm for performances of Lion Dance. There is no lack of virtuoso performers in the Chinese classical tradition in Malaysia. Advanced training is however not presently available with most Malaysian virtuoso musicians obtaining their advanced training either in China or Singapore. Various professional and semi-professional Chinese orchestras are in existence. Malaysian western trained classical conductors are employed full-time. Much of the music played is imported from China. There are however some accomplished Malaysian composers for this medium such as Saw Boon Kiat and Chew Hee Chiat. There has been a local Malaysian Chinese recording industries since the 1960s with generations of Chinese singers involved in Mandopop music. In the 1960s singers such as Poon Sow Keng (ÊΩòÁßÄÁìä) achieved notable success in the region, and in the 1970s and 80s, Malaysian Chinese pop singers such as Wong Shiau Chuen, Lan Yin, Donny Yap, and Lee Yee were popular. In more recent times, popular singers include Eric Moo, Lee Sin Je, Fish Leong, Z Chen, Penny Tai and Daniel Lee. =Indian music= Traditional Indian music may be associated with religious tradition and faith. As its origins in India, there are two systems of traditional or classical Indian music in Malaysia: Carnatic music and Hindustani music. Since Tamils from South India are the predominant group among the Indian population in Malaysia, it is the South Indian Carnatic music which predominates. Simply speaking, Hindustani classical music is more lyric-oriented, while Carnatic classical music emphasises musical structure. Indian classical music as it is performed in Malaysia has remained true to its origin. There is practically no other cultural influence. Other than reflecting Indian life, the purpose of Indian classical music is to refine the soul. The fundamental elements of Carnatic music are the raga and the tala. A raga is a scale of notes, while the tala is the time-measure. A Carnatic music concert usually starts with a composition with lyrical and passages in a particular raga. This will be followed by a few major and subsequently some minor compositions. In Malaysia, traditional and classical Indian music are studied and performed by Malaysians of Indian ethnic origin with material that still comes from India. Musical productions are mainly in the form of dance dramas incorporating instrumental ensemble, vocal music and dance. Musical instruments used in the performances are imported from India. Over the years, Punjabi music has established itself in Malaysia. One example of famous Punjabi music is bhangra. Many Malaysian songs today have the Punjabi influence. For example, the sound of the dhol, an instrument used mainly by the Punjabis, has been incorporated in many Malay, Chinese and Indian songs in Malaysia. =Indigenous tribal music= Two Dayak tribesmen playing Sapeh in Sarawak The Orang Asli groups of West Malaysia, Semang, Senoi, and Orang Melayu Asli, have their own musical traditions. The Semang people are nomadic and their musical instruments are disposable and created when needed, and instruments used include nose flute (salet, nabad), Jew's harp and tube zither (k…ôr…ëtu≈ã) which are also used by the Senoi. Instruments used by the Senoi are more long-lasting and include k…ôr…ôb (a two- string chordophone). The Orang Melayu Asli however have closer contact with Malay and Chinese populations and used a wider range of musical instruments ranging from thigh xylophone (kongkong) to violin. The instruments may be used for shamanistic purposes such as singing and trance-dancing ceremonies, and healing rituals. A number of ethnic groups such as the various Dayak tribes (e.g. Iban, Murut), Kadazan, and Bajau are found in Sabah and Sarawak. The music of these people include vocal music for epics and narratives; songs for life-cycle events and rituals associated with religion, healing, growing rice, hunting game, and waging war; songs for dancing and community entertainment; as well as a wide variety of instrumental music. Instruments used include drums, gongs, flutes, zithers, xylophones, and Jew's harps, of which the bronze gongs are the most significant. Ensembles of gongs of various sizes are played to welcome guests and in ceremonies and dances. A well-known instrument in Sarawak is the sapeh, a plucked lute of the Kayan and Kenyah people which is used for entertainment and dancing. Other instruments include the xylophone jatung utang, bamboo flutes (suling, seruling, kesuling, ensuling, and nabat), and sets of bamboo tubes called togunggak which were formerly played in headhunting ceremonies of the Murut. =World music= Ethnic music has also found a new and vigorous following, with world music festivals like the Rainforest World Music Festival, held annually since 1998 in a scenic open-air setting in Sarawak. The first Malaysian \\"ethnic fusion\\" group to play on this international platform was Akar Umbi - comprising Temuan ceremonial singer Minah Angong (1930‚Äì1999), Antares and Rafique Rashid. Unfortunately, the charismatic Minah Angong (better known as Mak Minah) died just three weeks after winning over the hearts of a whole new audience at the RWMF 1999. This left Akar Umbi with only one posthumously released CD to its name ('Songs of the Dragon,' Magick River, 2002). Private companies like Trident Entertainment have begun to invest in the production, distribution and promotion of the \\"ethnic fringe\\" in Malaysian music. Classical music Within Malaysia, the largest performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO). Malay popular music is a combination of the music from all ethnicities in the country. The Malaysian government has taken steps in controlling what music is available in Malaysia; rap music has been criticised, heavy metal has been limited, and foreign bands must submit a copy of a recent concert before playing in Malaysia. It is believed that this music is a bad influence on youth. =Fusion music= In the field of Malaysian contemporary music a number of composers have gained international recognition, for example award-winning composers Chong Kee Yong, Dr Tazul Izan Tajuddin, Yii Kah Hoe, Saidah Rastam, Adeline Wong and others, encompassing a diverse range of styles and aesthetics. Pop Malaysia's pop music scene developed from traditional social dance and entertainment music such as asli, inang, joget, dondang sayang, zapin and masri, which were adapted to Anglo-American dance band arrangement by Bangsawan troupes in the 1920s and 1930s. The Bangsawan troupes are in fact a type of Malaysian opera influenced by Indian opera at first known as Wayang Parsi (Persia) which was started by rich Persians residing in India. They portrayed stories from diverse groups such as Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese, Indonesian and Malay. Music, dance, and acting with costumes are used in performance depending on the stories told. The musicians were mostly local Malays, Filipinos and Guanis (descendants from Goa in India). One of the earliest modern Malay pop songs was \\"Tudung Periok\\", sung by Momo Latif, who recorded it in 1930. In the 1950s, P. Ramlee became the most popular Malay singer and composer with a range of slow ballads such as \\"Azizah\\", \\"Dendang Perantau\\" and the evergreen \\"Di Mana Kan Ku Cari Ganti\\". In the 1960s, a genre of pop music influenced by The Beatles and other British rock and roll bands called 'Pop Yeh-yeh' appeared in Malaysia. The term \\"pop yeh-yeh\\" was taken from a line from the popular Beatles song, \\"She Loves You\\" (\\"she loves you, yeah-yeah-yeah\\"). In the 1960s and 1970s, a modified rock combo called kugiran (an abbreviation of \\"kumpulan gitar rancak\\", meaning rhythmic guitar bands) was also common, and was often used to accompany singers. In the mid-1990s, Dangdut experienced a resurgence after lying dormant since the early 1980s with the debut of Amelina. Her least successful album sold in the 100,000s, a feat that is yet to be repeated in the 2010s. Composer Ruslan Mamat , who pioneered the modern Dangdut, credited Ace of Base for the tempo reference. Contemporary pop music exchanges between Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei are normal since the Malay language is widely spoken in all four countries. Hip Hop KRU is the most successful Hip Hop dance group in Malaysia. After bringing Rap music to the masses in 1982, they established their own record label creating the first Malaysian girl group Feminin and R&B; crooners Indigo. Feminin debuted at RTM Eid ul-Fitr special in 1993 marking the start of the 80s girls group era. SonaOne is a Malaysian rapper with notable songs like \\"I don't care\\" and \\"No More\\" Rock Malaysian rock reached its peak in the 80s and early 90s with the local adaptation of a fusion of blues rock and ballad. The popularity even reached the neighbouring country of Indonesia. Awie is an award winning Malaysian rock singer.

Contrary to popular misconception, he was not a khan (king), but a warlord and a kingmaker for several khans, and the de facto regent of the Horde in the 1370s. His defeat in Battle of Kulikovo marked the beginning of the decline of the Horde, as well as his own. Viceroy of Crimea Mamai became governor, sometime in the second half of the 1350s, of a territory that later would become the Crimean Khanate. During the rule of Berdi Beg (1357‚Äì59) Mamai was appointed as beqlar beg (beylerbey), a position simultaneously combining the duties of general of the army, minister of foreign affairs, and the head of the supreme court. Interregnum after the assassination of Berdi Beg Upon the assassination of Berdi Beg by Qulpa in 1359, Mamai associated himself with one of the coalitions formed to depose Qulpa. During that period of time the Golden Horde was in relative chaos; numerous regional governors were striving to become the Khan. Qulpa eventually was killed by Nawruz Beg who was himself assassinated less than six months later. Mamai, who was not a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, played a key role in promoting and supporting rival khans of the White Horde (western part of Golden Horde). In 1361 he supported ƒûabdullah, son of Uzbeg Khan, who became Khan in Crimea. Upon the death of ƒûabdullah in 1370, Mamai supported Bulak under regency of Tulun Beg Khanum, who only briefly enjoyed power before being replaced by his main opponent Urus in 1372. Attempts to subdue the Principalities of Rus After being badly defeated by Russians under Dmitri Donskoi first in 1378 at the Battle of the Vozha River and then at the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), Mamai began to assemble a large force to punish Dmitri. But he was defeated by Tokhtamysh on the banks of the Kalka River and was either executed by Tokhtamysh or assassinated by the Genoese after fleeing to Caffa.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980-1584, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 237. The death of Mamai paved the way for the next khan to reunify the Golden Horde. Legacy The memory of Mamai has endured for centuries. Contemporary Russian language has an expression \\"–∫–∞–∫ –ú–∞–º–∞–π –ø—Ä–æ—à—ë–ª\\" (kak Mamaj pro≈°jol), which translates roughly to \\"it's as if Mamai came through here\\", used to describe an utter mess. The burial of Mamai was found by the native Crimean and famous Russian painter Ivan Aivazovsky. Mamai was buried in a village of ≈ûeyh Mamay (today Aivazovske, Kirovske Raion).  Purported descendants  Khan Mamatsios or Mamatzios, Mamatsou,Mamatsu (Mamai-son) Macedonie was a supposed son of Mamai. One of his sons, Manzur Kiyat, purportedly escaped to Lithuania, and, serving Grand Prince Vytautas the Great, received the title of Prince of Hlinsk with multiple estates around the modern city of Poltava (Ukraine). These legendary events could have taken place in the 15th century, although the first documented mention of the Glinski princes is made in 1437. Michael Glinski was the most illustrious member of the family: he studied at the German university, took part as a knight in the Italian Wars, was the most powerful man in Lithuania in the 16th century, but later rebelled and run away with his brothers to Muscovy and helped the Russians to retake the city of Smolensk. His niece Elena Glinskaya was married to Vasily III, Grand Prince of Moscow, and Ivan the Terrible was her son.

After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from Northwestern University and a Masters of Arts in Elementary Education from National Louis University, he worked as a teacher sharing his love of reading with elementary, middle, and high school students. He worked for several publishing companies where he published, acquired, edited, marketed, and developed quality children's books. In 1985, Clements added his own work to the market with a picture book entitled Bird Delbert. His first novel was the award-winning Frindle, which has won sixteen state book awards, as well as the Christopher Award. Clements lived in Maine with his wife Rebecca until his death. He had four sons- John, Nathaniel, George, and Charles. Awards Frindle The Children's Literature Association named Frindle the best English-language children's book published in 1996 that did not win a major contemporary book award, thus making it the winner of the Phoenix Award for 2016.\\"Phoenix Award\\" .

Etymology Hebrew ◊©◊†◊¢◊® ≈†in øar is equivalent to the Egyptian Sngr and Hittite ≈†an·∏´ar(a), all referring to southern Mesopotamia. Some Assyriologists considered ≈†in øar a western variant or cognate of ≈†umer (Sumer), with their original being the Sumerians' own name for their country, ki-en-gi(-r), but this is \\"beset with philological difficulties\\". Sayce (1895) identified Shinar as cognate with the following names: Sangara/Sangar mentioned in the context of the Asiatic conquests of Thutmose III (15th century BCE); Sanhar/Sankhar of the Amarna letters (14th century BCE); the Greeks' Singara; and modern Sinjar, in Upper Mesopotamia, near the Khabur River. Accordingly, he proposed that Shinar was in Upper Mesopotamia, but acknowledged that the Bible gives important evidence that it was in the south.Sayce, Archibald Henry (1895). Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 67-68. Albright (1924) suggested identification with the Kingdom of Khana.W. F. Albright, Shinar-≈†an·∏°ar and Its Monarch Amraphel. American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures 40/2, 1924, 125-133. Hebrew Bible The name ≈†in øar occurs eight times in the Hebrew Bible, in which it refers to Babylonia. This location of Shinar is evident from its description as encompassing both Babel/Babylon (in northern Babylonia) and Erech/Uruk (in southern Babylonia). In the Book of Genesis 10:10, the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom is said to have been \\"Babel [Babylon], and Erech [Uruk], and Akkad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\\" Verse 11:2 states that Shinar enclosed the plain that became the site of the Tower of Babel after the Great Flood. After the Flood, the sons of Shem, Ham, and Japheth stayed first in the highlands of Armenia and then migrated to Shinar.Vuibert, Ancient History, 25. In Genesis 14:1,9, King Amraphel rules Shinar. Shinar is further mentioned in Joshua 7:21; Isaiah 11:11; Daniel 1:2; and Zechariah 5:11, as a general synonym for Babylonia. Jubilees Jubilees 9:3 allots Shinar (or, in the Ethiopic text, Sadna Sena\`or) to Ashur, son of Shem. Jubilees 10:20 states that the Tower of Babel was built with bitumen from the sea of Shinar. David Rohl theorized that the Tower was actually located in Eridu, which was once located on the Persian Gulf, where there are ruins of a massive, ancient ziggurat worked from bitumen.Rohl, David, Legends: The Genesis of Civilization (1998) and The Lost Testament (2002) References Mesopotamia Sumer Torah places Noach (parsha) Nimrod ","title":"Shinar"},{"id":"241851","text":"Thermoception or thermoreception is the sensation and perception of temperature, or more accurately, temperature differences inferred from heat flux. The details of how temperature receptors work are still being investigated. Ciliopathy is associated with decreased ability to sense heat, thus cilia may aid in the process. Transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) are believed to play a role in many species in sensation of hot, cold, and pain. Vertebrates have at least two types of sensor: those that detect heat and those that detect cold. A particularly specialized form of thermoception is used by Crotalinae (pit viper) and Boidae (boa) snakes, which can effectively see the infrared radiation emitted by hot objects.E. A. Newman, P. H. Hartline (1982). The Infrared ‚Äòvision‚Äô of snakes. Scientific American 20:116-127. The snakes' face has a pair of holes, or pits, lined with temperature sensors. The sensors indirectly detect infrared radiation by its heating effect on the skin inside the pit. They can work out which part of the pit is hottest, and therefore the direction of the heat source, which could be a warm-blooded prey animal. By combining information from both pits, the snake can also estimate the distance of the object. The Common vampire bat has specialized infrared sensors in its nose-leaf.L. K√ºrten, U. Schmidt, K. Sch√§fer (1984): Warm and Cold Receptors in the Nose of the Vampire Bat, Desmodus rotundus. Naturwissenschaften 71:327-28.E. O. Gracheva, J. F. Codero- Morales, J. A. Gonz√°lez-Carca√≠a, N. T. Ingolia, C. Manno, C. I. Aranguren, J. S. Weissman, D. Julius (2011). Ganglion-specific splicing of TRPV1 underlies infrared sensation in vampire bats. Nature 476:88-91. Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood. The infrared sense enables Desmodus to localize homeothermic (warm-blooded) animals (cattle, horses, wild mammals) within a range of about 10 to 15 cm. This infrared perception is possibly used in detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey. Recent researchB√°lint, A., Andics, A., G√°csi, M. et al. Dogs can sense weak thermal radiation. Sci Rep 10, 3736 (2020). has demonstrated that dogs, like vampire bats, can detect weak thermal radiation with their noses. Other animals with specialized heat detectors are forest fire seeking beetles (Melanophila acuminata), which lay their eggs in conifers freshly killed by forest fires. Darkly pigmented butterflies Pachliopta aristolochiae and Troides rhadamathus use specialized heat detectors to avoid damage while basking. The blood sucking bugs Triatoma infestans may also have a specialised thermoception organ. In humans, temperature sensation from thermoreceptors enters the spinal cord along the axons of Lissauer's tract that synapse on second order neurons in grey matter of the dorsal horn. The axons of these second order neurons then decussate, joining the spinothalamic tract as they ascend to neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. A study in 2017 shows that the thermosensory information passes to the lateral parabrachial nucleus rather than to the thalamus and this drives thermoregulatory behaviour.

His performing career spanned more than four decades. As a writer and composer, he created 18 comic operas, nearly 100 musical sketches, some 600 songs and piano pieces, three books and both serious and comic pieces for newspapers and magazines. Grossmith created a series of nine characters in the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan from 1877 to 1889, including Sir Joseph Porter, in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance (1880) and Ko-Ko in The Mikado (1885‚Äì87). He also wrote, in collaboration with his brother Weedon, the 1892 comic novel The Diary of a Nobody. Grossmith was also famous in his day for performing his own comic piano sketches and songs, both before and after his Gilbert and Sullivan days, becoming the most popular British solo performer of the 1890s. Some of his comic songs endure today, including \\"See Me Dance the Polka\\". He continued to perform into the first decade of the 20th century. His son, George Grossmith Jr., became an actor, playwright and producer of Edwardian musical comedies. Life and career Grossmith's father George Grossmith was born in Islington, London, and grew up in St. Pancras and Hampstead, London. His father, also named George (1820‚Äì1880), was the chief reporter for The Times and other newspapers at the Bow Street Magistrates' Court and was also a lecturer and entertainer. His mother was Louisa Emmeline Grossmith n√©e Weedon (d. 1882). Over the years, Grossmith's father spent less of his time at Bow Street and more of it touring as a performer.Joseph, Tony. \\"Grossmith, George (1847‚Äì1912)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 21 October 2007 As a young man, Grossmith was usually credited as \\"Jnr\\" to distinguish him from his father, especially when they performed together, but for most of his career, he was credited simply as \\"George Grossmith\\". Later, his actor-playwright-theatre manager son was credited as George Grossmith \\"Jr\\" rather than \\"III\\"; some sources confuse the two men. His other son, Lawrence Grossmith, was also a successful actor, primarily in America.Parker, pp. 396‚Äì397 Grossmith had a younger sister, Emily, and younger brother, Weedon. In 1855, he went to boarding school at Massingham House on Haverstock Hill in the district of Hampstead. There he studied the piano and began to amuse his friends and teachers with shadow pantomimes, and later by playing the piano by ear. His family moved to Haverstock Hill when young Grossmith was 10, and he became a day student.Grossmith (1888), chapter II At the age of 12, he transferred to the North London Collegiate School in Camden Town. He was back in St. Pancras by age 13.Joseph, pp. 26‚Äì29 He was an avid amateur photographer and painter as a teenager, but it was his brother Weedon who went to art school. The Grossmith family had many friends engaged in the arts, including J. L. Toole, Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, H. J. Byron, Tom Hood, T. W. Robertson, and John Hollingshead (later, the manager of the Gaiety Theatre, London). Grossmith had hoped to become a barrister. Instead, he worked for many years, beginning in the 1860s, training and then substituting for his father as the Bow Street reporter for The Times, among other publications, when his father was on his lecture tours. Among the cases on which he reported was the Clerkenwell bombing by the Fenians in 1867. At the same time as he began reporting, he began to write humorous articles for periodicals and to participate in amateur theatrical performances.Grossmith (1888), chapter III He also joined his father in his entertainments, lectures, and imitations, and began to add music to the entertainments, which his father had not done.Grossmith's obituary in The Times, 2 March 1912 In 1873, Grossmith married Emmeline Rosa Noyce (1849‚Äì1905), the daughter of a neighbourhood physician, whom he had met years earlier at a children's party. The couple had four children: George, Sylvia (1875‚Äì1932; married Stuart James Bevan in 1900), Lawrence and Cordelia Rosa (1879‚Äì1943).Johnson, p. 43 The family lived initially in Marylebone before moving, about 1885, to Dorset Square nearby. =Early performing career= 1870 sheet music Young Grossmith received some recognition for amateur songs and sketches at private parties and, beginning in 1864, at penny readings. He also participated in a small number of theatricals as an amateur, including playing John Chodd, Jr. in Robertson's play, Society, at the Gallery of Illustration, in 1868. The after-piece was a burlesque, written by Grossmith's father, on the Dickens play No Thoroughfare. He then played the title role in Paul Pry, a comedy by Poole, also at the Gallery of Illustration, in 1870.Grossmith (1888), Chapter VI But he and his father felt that his talents lay in \\"sketch\\" comedy rather than theatre. The younger Grossmith admired the comic pianist and entertainer John Orlando Parry, who created and performed in many of the German Reed Entertainments, and he tried to emulate Parry in developing his own sketches, consisting of humorous anecdotes, mildly satirical comment, ad lib chat, and comic songs centred on the piano.Grossmith (1888), Chapter IV Grossmith took to the professional stage in 1870 with a sketch called Human Oddities, written by his father, and a song called \\"The Gay Photographer\\" (that is, the \\"carefree\\" photographer). The song, with words by Grossmith's father and music by young Grossmith, concerns a photographer who broke the heart of a young lady named Miss Jenkins; so she drank his chemicals and died.Cover art of the sheet music, from \\"Images of Photographers\\" website (2005, Bright Bytes Studio), accessed 9 March 2008 In late 1870, the younger Grossmith appeared on his own with a nightly spot at the \\"old Polytechnic\\" in Regent Street, where comic sketches alternated with scientific and serious lectures for the entertainment of the public. Human Oddities and another sketch, The Yellow Dwarf, were successful for Grossmith, and he took the former work on tour for six months. An 1871 Grossmith sketch was called He was a Careful Man. Biographer Tony Joseph notes that, except for a few early pieces, nearly all of Grossmith's material was written and composed by Grossmith himself. Joseph describes the sketches as \\"a light- hearted sending up of various aspects of contemporary life and manners. ...he was the complete performer... as a pianist (he performed for the most part sitting at a piano)... as a raconteur... as a mimic, facial expression, timing‚Äîhe had it all. A short, dapper figure, he turned his lack of inches to positive advantage, and audiences took to him everywhere.\\" 1878 programme for Cups and Saucers and H.M.S. Pinafore Grossmith toured in the summer of 1871 with Mr and Mrs Howard Paul and occasionally afterwards. He and Mrs Paul would also appear together in The Sorcerer in 1877.Mrs Howard Paul left her husband (Howard Paul, 1830‚Äì1905) around 1877, as he was having an affair with the actress-dancer Letty Lind, by whom he fathered two illegitimate children. However, Mrs Paul continued performing under this name. Also in 1871, at the Polytechnic, he performed three more sketches, The Puddleton Penny Readings, Theatricals at Thespis Lodge and The Silver Wedding (including what would be one of his most popular songs, \\"I am so Volatile\\", with words by his father).Stone, David. \\"George Grossmith\\" at the Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 9 March 2008 On 14 February 1872, Grossmith gave a sketch parody of a penny reading at the Gaiety Theatre, London, since on Ash Wednesday, theatres refrained from presenting costumed performances out of respect for the holiday. At the time, coincidentally, the Gaiety was presenting Thespis, Gilbert and Sullivan's first collaboration.Moss, Simon. Archive of G&S; memorabilia, accessed 9 March 2008 Throughout these years, Grossmith continued working at Bow Street during the day. In 1873, Grossmith and his father began joint tours of humorous recitations and comic sketches at literary institutes and public halls, to church groups and to branches of the YMCA all over England and even in Scotland and Wales. Young Grossmith's sketches at this time included The Puddleton Penny Readings, Our Choral Society and In the Stalls. They toured almost constantly for the following three years, but they returned to see their families in London on weekends.Grossmith (1888), Chapter V Around this time, he met and became firm friends with Fred Sullivan, and afterwards, he met Sullivan's brother Arthur.Grossmith, George. \\"Sir Arthur Sullivan\\", The Pall Mall Magazine, vol. 23, no. 94 (February 1901), p. 251 Through Arthur Cecil, Sullivan, and some of their friends, Grossmith began to be invited to entertain at private \\"society\\" parties, which he continued to do throughout his career. Later, these parties would often occur late in the evening after Grossmith performed at the Savoy Theatre.Grossmith (1888), Chapter VII In 1876, he collaborated with Florence Marryat, the author and reciter, on Entre Nous. This piece consisted of a series of piano sketches, alternating with scenes and costumed recitations, including a two-person \\"satirical musical sketch\\", really a short comic opera, called Cups and Saucers, which they then toured. Grossmith also took a number of engagements, including recitals at private homes. In 1877, Lionel Brough introduced another popular Grossmith song, \\"The Muddle Puddle Junction Porter\\". By then, Grossmith had become friendly with many in the music and theatre establishments, including Arthur Sullivan and impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte; and Grossmith had the opportunity to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury and other Sullivan works at charity benefits.Grossmith, George. \\"Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Personal Reminiscence\\". The Pall Mall magazine, Volume 23, pp. 250‚Äì60, George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., 1901 Grossmith as Wells in The Sorcerer, 1877 After entertaining professionally in sketch comedy for seven years, however, Grossmith discovered that his income decreased each year as his family and household expenses increased. He also disliked travelling. Accordingly, he was pleased when, despite his relative inexperience in legitimate theatre, he received a letter from Arthur Sullivan in November 1877 inviting him to take a part in his new piece with W. S. Gilbert: The Sorcerer. =D'Oyly Carte years= Grossmith had appeared in charity performances of Trial by Jury, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen himGrossmith profile at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 9 March 2008 (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge),Ainger, p. 138 and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson's Society at the Gallery of Illustration.Ainger, p. 136 Sullivan mentioned to Arthur Cecil, the leading tenor from the Gallery of Illustration, that he was looking for someone to play the comic title role in his new comic opera, The Sorcerer. Cecil reminded Sullivan about Grossmith, and Sullivan seized on the idea. After singing for Sullivan, upon meeting Gilbert, Grossmith wondered aloud if the role shouldn't be played by \\"a fine man with a fine voice\\". Gilbert replied, \\"That is exactly what we don't want.\\"Ayre, p. 137 Although Grossmith had reservations about cancelling his touring engagements and going into the \\"wicked\\" professional theatre (a move that might lose him church and other engagements in the future), and Richard D'Oyly Carte's backers objected to casting a sketch comedian in the central role of a comic opera, Grossmith was hired. Patience, 1881 Grossmith was a hit as the tradesmanlike John Wellington Wells, the title role in The Sorcerer, and became a regular member of Richard D'Oyly Carte's company. He created all nine of the lead comic baritone roles in Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy Operas in London from 1877 to 1889, including the pompous First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Joseph Porter, in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878); Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, who is an expert at everything except \\"military knowledge\\" (1880); the aesthetic poet, Reginald Bunthorne in Patience (1881); the love-lonely Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe (1882); the sarcastic cripple, King Gama, in Princess Ida (1884); Ko-Ko the cheap tailor, elevated to the post of Lord High Executioner, in The Mikado (1885); the accursed Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore (1887); and the pathetic jester, Jack Point, in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888). On 29 January 1887, one week after the opening night of Ruddigore, Grossmith fell dangerously ill.Sources vary on what the illness was. Lytton wrote in his memoir that the diagnosis was peritonitis. The Times reported, \\"It is feared that a severe cold, caught on Friday [28 January], has turned to inflammation\\" (\\"News in Brief\\", The Times, 2 February 1887, p. 10). The Pall Mall Gazette, quoting Grossmith's wife, called it \\"a chilled liver and thorough disorganization of the digestive organs\\" (\\"The Illness of Mr Grossmith, The Pall Mall Gazette, 3 February 1887, p. 8). However, by 13 February, his physicians pronounced him convalescent,New York Times article concluding with a paragraph about Grossmith's illness and subsequent improvement, accessed 9 March 2008 and he resumed the role of Robin by 18 February.The Times, 18 February 1887, p. 12, col. B During Grossmith's absence, his understudy Henry Lytton, who would later become the principal comedian of the company, had the opportunity to perform the role in Grossmith's place.Lytton, Henry. Secrets of a Savoyard, chapter 3, describing Lytton's substitution for Grossmith as Robin in Ruddigore , accessed 9 March 2008 Yeomen, 1888 Years later, Grossmith's obituary in The Times noted the comedian's \\"nimbleness, his diverting tricks, his still more diverting dignity‚Äîthe dignity of a man of few inches high or round‚Äîand his incomparable power of rapid speech and singing.\\" The Daily Telegraph wrote of his Jack Point: \\"Whether giving expression to poor Jack‚Äôs professional wit, or hiding a sorry heart behind light words... Mr Grossmith was master of the part he assumed.\\"PeoplePlay website, quoting The Daily Telegraph , accessed 9 March 2008 In 1883, The Times, reviewing a matinee performance of Iolanthe, wrote: \\"Mr. Grossmith's impersonation of the Lord Chancellor has ... become an exquisitely refined satire.\\"\\"Savoy Theatre\\" . The Times, 17 February 1883, republished at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 4 May 2010 On the other hand, his sketch comedy background had trained Grossmith to improvise comic business. Gilbert and the actor had an exchange during rehearsals for The Mikado about an improvised moment in which Jessie Bond pushed Grossmith, as they kneeled before the Mikado, and he rolled completely over. Gilbert requested that they cut out the gag, and Grossmith replied: \\"but I get an enormous laugh by it\\". Gilbert replied \\"So you would if you sat on a pork-pie.\\"Grossmith (1888), p. Chapter VI, p. 116 The actor, jittery on opening nights, is depicted both on and off stage in the biographical film, Topsy Turvy. Hesketh Pearson wrote in 1935 that Grossmith injected himself with drugs to calm his nerves.Pearson, Hesketh. Gilbert and Sullivan: A Biography (1935), p. 158 and in the film he is shown injecting himself on the opening night of The Mikado. In his diary, Arthur Sullivan wrote afterwards, \\"All went very well except Grossmith, whose nervousness nearly upset the piece\\".Allen 1975, p. 241 Grossmith spoke self-deprecatingly about his own vocal prowess (Sullivan and others disagreed): :Of course, I haven't any voice to speak of, but I have a great register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. In Ruddygore, Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an enormous bass voice, and who had to go down to the lower E flat. Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [low E-flat] below. Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.Grossmith, quoted in Wells, Walter J. Souvenir of Arthur Sullivan. London: George Newnes, 1901 Grossmith's The Great Tay-Kin During his time with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Grossmith's father and mother died (in 1880 and 1882, respectively). Throughout this period, Grossmith continued to perform his sketches, often late at night after performing at the Savoy, and continued to write new sketches, such as Amateur Theatricals (1878), A Juvenile Party (1879), A Musical Nightmare (1880), and A Little Yachting (1886).Berger, Leon. \\"George Grossmith\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Macmillan, 1998 He also wrote the music for Arthur Law's short comic opera, Uncle Samuel (1881), the one-act curtain raiser that preceded Patience on the Opera Comique programme. His Cups and Saucers was revived and played with Pinafore and also played by the company on tour. Other comic operas by Grossmith during these years included Mr Guffin's Elopement (1882) and A Peculiar Case (1884, both with libretti by Arthur Law) and The Real Case of Hide and Seekyll (1886). Grossmith also continued to give his \\"society\\" and other entertainments, often late at night after his performance at the Savoy. He also composed the music for another comic opera, The Great Tay-Kin and another piece, both with libretti by Arthur Law, which were performed at Toole's Theatre in 1885.Review of Grossmith's work that mentions The Great Tay-Kin, accessed 9 March 2008 Grossmith also wrote, composed, and performed in several one-man drawing room sketches, short comic operas or monologues that were given at the Opera Comique or the Savoy Theatre in place of the companion pieces when shorter matinee programmes were playing. These works included Beauties on the Beach (1878),Information about Beauties on the Beach and some other Grossmith sketches, accessed 28 March 2008 Five Hamlets (1878), a revival of his A Silver Wedding (1879), The Drama on Crutches (1883), Homburg, or Haunted by The Mikado (1887‚Äì88),Programme from the first revival of Pinafore in 1887, with Homburg or Haunted by The Mikado as the afterpiece, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive and Holiday Hall (1888). In reviewing a matinee performance of The Drama on Crutches, The Times commented, \\"he not only satirizes the present tendency of fashionable amateurs to join the stage, but also parodies ... the manner of Mr. Irving and other actors of the present day, including himself. The sketch created great amusement, though of course, it depends entirely for its success upon the actor's powers of mimicry.\\" Grossmith also performed in charity events, including as Bouncer in Cox and Box in 1879 at the Opera Comique. Vanity Fair print, 1888 In addition, Grossmith's comic song written in 1886, \\"See me dance the polka\\", was extremely popular. It has been used in a number of films and has been quoted or referred to in literature and music, including in the poem/song \\"Polka\\" from Fa√ßade by Edith Sitwell and William Walton. Other songs he wrote during this period include \\"An Awful Little Scrub\\" (1880), \\"The Speaker's Eye\\" (1882), \\"The 'Bus Conductor's Song\\" (1883), \\"How I Became an Actor\\" (1883), \\"See Me Reverse\\" (1884), \\"The Lost Key\\" (1885), and \\"The Happy Fatherland\\" (1887). =Later years= Grossmith left the D'Oyly Carte company near the end of the original run of The Yeomen of the Guard on 17 August 1889 and resumed his career entertaining at the piano,The Daily News, 19 August 1889, p. 2 which he continued to do for more than 15 years afterwards.Simon Moss website, which includes images of 1896, 1900 and 1903 programmes describing performances of sketches and entertainments by Grossmith, accessed 9 March 2008 Despite his dislike of travelling, he toured in Britain, Ireland, and, on five occasions, North America. His drawing-room sketches included his own popular songs, such as \\"See me Dance the Polka\\", \\"The Happy Fatherland\\", \\"The Polka and the Choir- boy\\", \\"Thou of My Thou\\", \\"The French Verbs\\", \\"Go on Talking ‚Äì Don't Mind Me\\", \\"I Don't Mind Flies\\". His new sketches during this period included Modern Music and Morals (1889), On Tour; or, Piano and I (1891), A Seaside Holiday (1892), Fashionable Music (1892) and Is Music a Failure? (1892). According to The Times, \\"His genial satire was enjoyed even by those at whom its shafts were aimed.\\" When he toured Scotland in the autumn of 1890, Grossmith gave a command performance for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. He also composed the music for a three-act comic opera with a libretto by Gilbert, Haste to the Wedding (1892). In this piece, his son George Grossmith Jr. made his stage debut. Musically more challenging than any composition he had attempted before, this work was unsuccessful. Later, however, Grossmith said that the experience of writing with Gilbert was one of the happiest of his life.Banfield, p. 552 In 1892‚Äì93 he toured North America (his second tour there), writing successful new sketches, \\"How I Discovered America\\" and \\"Baby on the Shore\\" (1893).Banfield, p. 554 Charles (left) and Lupin Pooter at Broadstairs, from Chapter VI of The Diary of a Nobody In 1892, Grossmith collaborated with his brother Weedon Grossmith to expand a series of amusing columns they had written in 1888‚Äì89 for Punch. The Diary of a Nobody was published as a novelGrossmith, George. The Diary of a Nobody, Bristol: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1892 and has never been out of print since. The book is a sharp analysis of social insecurity, and Charles Pooter of The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, was immediately recognised as one of the great comic characters of English literature. The work has itself been the object of dramatisation and adaptation, including three times for television: 1964, accessed 21 October 2007 1979 accessed 21 October 2007 and 2007.Grossmith, George and Grossmith, Weedon.

He also continued to compose music, including the comic opera Castle Bang (1894) and the sketches The Ibsenite Drama (1895) and Do We Enjoy Our Holidays? (1897) and songs like \\"The Baby on the Shore\\" (1893), \\"Johnnie at the Gaiety\\" (1895), \\"Tommy's First Love\\" (1897), and \\"The Happy Old Days at Peckham\\" (1903). In 1894‚Äì95, however, Gilbert enticed Grossmith to take the role of George Griffenfeld in His Excellency, with music by Frank Osmond Carr. Also in 1897, he played briefly as King Ferdinand V of Vingolia in F. C. Burnand's His Majesty at the Savoy Theatre and made two more short London stage appearances thereafter, as Scoones in Young Mr Yarde (1898) and Lambert Simnel in The Gay Pretenders (1900).Who's Who in the Theatre, First Edition, London, Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons, 1912, p. 214 An 1896 interview of Grossmith reveals him feeling his age and considering the end of his touring career, while enjoying time spent at home with his family, dogs and antique piano collection.Banfield, p. 550 Grossmith suffered from depression after the death of his wife of cancer in 1905, and his health began to fail, so that he increasingly missed engagements. He was nevertheless persuaded to continue giving his entertainments, which he did on a less frequent basis, until November 1908. The following year, Grossmith retired to Folkestone, Kent, a town that he had visited for many years, where he wrote his second volume of reminiscences, Piano and I (1910). Grossmith died at his home in Folkestone at the age of 64. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, in the London Borough of Brent.Blackett-Ord, Carol. \\"George Grossmith (1847‚Äì1912), Entertainer and author\\", National Portrait Gallery, accessed 28 September 2019 In his will, dated 26 October 1908, Grossmith left small bequests to a variety of charities and persons; 2,000 pounds, artworks and heirlooms to each of his children (except that Lawrence did not receive a cash bequest), his son George receiving also \\"two silver bowls presented to him by [Gilbert, Sullivan and] Carte [and] the ivory baton with which he conducted the orchestra on the occasion of his said son's first appearance on the stage\\" in Haste to the Wedding; and smaller bequests to his children's spouses and his nieces, nephews, grandchildren and some cousins, with the residuary estate shared equally by his children (although the residuary estate was not large).Johnson, pp. 40‚Äì42 Writings and compositions; legacy; recordings Carte after the failure of The Grand Duke Grossmith wrote numerous comic pieces for the magazine Punch, including a series of ten skits in 1884 inspired by his Bow Street experiences, which he called \\"Very Trying\\". He also wrote two memoirs, A Society Clown: Reminiscences (1888) and Piano and I: Further Reminiscences (1910). In his career, Grossmith wrote 18 comic operas, nearly 100 musical sketches, some 600 songs and piano pieces, and three books. He also wrote both serious and comic pieces for newspapers and magazines throughout his career, displaying a wide range of styles. Grossmith was followed, in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic roles, by a number of other popular performers, including Henry Lytton, Martyn Green, Peter Pratt, John Reed, and many others, who each owed a debt to Grossmith as the creator of the roles. Many actors have portrayed Grossmith in biographical films, revues and sketches.

Weedon Grossmith also illustrated The Diary of a Nobody to much acclaim. Grossmith trained as a painter, but was unable to make a living in that capacity and went on the stage largely for financial reasons. He was successful as an actor and as an impresario, and wrote several plays. As an actor, he specialised in comedy roles, and his typical characters, harassed and scheming, became so identified with him that the \\"Weedon Grossmith part\\" became a regular feature of the theatre of his day. Life and career =Early years= Grossmith in 1894 Grossmith was born in London and grew up in St. Pancras and Hampstead, London. His father, George Grossmith (1820‚Äì80), was the chief court reporter for The Times and other newspapers at the Bow Street police court and a lecturer and entertainer. His mother was Louisa Emmeline Grossmith n√©e Weedon (d. 1882). His brother, George, became famous as the principal comedian of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and was the most famous comedy-sketch pianist of the Victorian era.Berger, Leon. \\"George Grossmith\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Macmillan, 1998 Grossmith was educated at Massingham House on Haverstock Hill in Hampstead, and then at the North London Collegiate in Camden Town and Simpson's School, a local private establishment. Chapter II, available online here Interested in art, he trained as a painter at the West London School of Art, the Slade and the Royal Academy. His goal was to become a fashionable portrait painter. He had portraits and other pictures hung at the Academy (beginning with a full-length portrait of his father) and at the Grosvenor Gallery and elsewhere. However, his career as an artist was not as successful as he had hoped.Joseph, Tony. \\"Grossmith, George (1847-1912)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 21 October 2007 Richard D'Oyly Carte, having seen him in amateur performances, encouraged him to take to the stage professionally. Having, as he later recalled, liabilities of ¬£700 and cash assets of ¬£6, he consulted his fellow-artists Frank Holl and Luke Fildes about abandoning art in favour of the theatre: > He [Fildes] thought it madness when I had conquered all the great > difficulties of painting. I quite agreed with him, but when I told him of my > dreadful run of bad luck, and the little I had, he said he was bound to > admit that if I had another string to play on, it was worth considering. But > he still thought it an awful pity, and so have I thought ever since.\\"A > Varied Career\\", The Academy, 15 March 1913, p. 331 =Acting career= Grossmith (l) in Mr. Preedy and the Countess, 1905 Grossmith turned to acting in 1885, which he pursued until 1917. Joining Rosina Vokes's theatrical company in 1885, he went on tour in the provinces and in America. He first appeared in London at the Gaiety Theatre in 1887 as Woodcock in Woodcock's Little Game. Neither he nor the play was a success.\\"A Chat with Weedon Grossmith\\", The Era, 6 October 1894, p. 11 Grossmith contemplated giving up the stage and returning to painting. He was shunned by managers who had promised him work, but on the strength of his American successes he was engaged by Henry Irving in 1888 to play Jacques Strop at the Lyceum Theatre in Charles Selby's Robert Macaire. He was nearly dismissed for interpreting Irving's direction, \\"You must imitate me\\", as an instruction to give an impersonation of the star's well-known mannerisms. His earliest notable success was made in A Pantomime Rehearsal, a short play (parodying incompetent amateur theatricals) with which he was associated for many years. In 1888 Grossmith joined the company of Richard Mansfield in Wealth, playing the role of Percy Palfreyman. In the following year he began a long association with the Court Theatre; he appeared there in Aunt Jack, The Cabinet Minister and The Volcano. He also played in The School for Scandal at the Globe Theatre (1889) and portrayed Joseph Lebanon in Arthur Wing Pinero's Cabinet Minister (1890). In 1891, in partnership with Brandon Thomas, Grossmith presented and appeared in a triple bill, which included A Pantomime Rehearsal. After a shaky start, the production became a huge success; Grossmith appeared in it for more than 700 performances, in four different West End theatres, and he later calculated that Sebastian Smith as the leading man must have played the part about 1,000 times in London and on tour. Baby Mine (1911) Grossmith went on to appear in plays by playwrights such as Henry Arthur Jones and Jerome K. Jerome, opposite actors such as Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre and with Mrs. John Wood at the Court Theatre. In 1892, he played in W. S. Gilbert's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, a parody of Hamlet, at the Royal Court Theatre. He became known for playing comedy character roles, noting, \\"I am almost invariably cast for cowards, cads and snobs\\", and he was particularly good at portraying harassed, misunderstood little men as, like his brother George, he was small in stature. The Times wrote that the \\"Weedon Grossmith\\" part had become a recognised feature of current drama. He portrayed Archibald Rennick in Arthur Law's The New Boy (1894), Hamilton Preedy in Mr. Preedy and the Countess (1905), Jimmy Jinks in Baby Mine (1911), the Earl of Tweenwayes in The Amazons, Boney in The Misleading Lady, and the Judge in Stopping the Breach, his last new role (1917). The critic B. W. FindonFindon married a cousin of Arthur Sullivan wrote, \\"Among the survivors of the old brigade ‚Äì of the artists who thoroughly understand the requirements of farcical comedy, who know how to treat its humour with breadth, and grapple successfully with its ludicrous situations ‚Äì is Mr. Weedon Grossmith. He is one of the best ‚Äì I think I may say the best actor of farce on the stage of to-day.\\"Findon, B. W., \\"Baby Mine\\", The Play Pictorial, April 1911, p. 100 Grossmith's last stage appearance was in 1918, in his old role of Lord Arthur Pomeroy in A Pantomime Rehearsal, with an all- star cast including Charles Hawtrey, Fay Compton, Irene Castle and Rutland Barrington, at a charity matin√©e attended by King George V, Queen Mary and Queen Alexandra.\\"Masks And Faces ‚Äì Matinee for Actors' Pensions ‚Äì Old Plays Still Fresh\\", The Times, 18 December 1918, p. 6 Grossmith was also the lessee of London's Vaudeville Theatre from 1894 to 1896 and Terry's Theatre until 1917. =Author and playwright= Grossmith's illustration of Charles (left) and Lupin Pooter (Chap.

The book is a sharp analysis of social insecurity, and Charles Pooter of The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, was immediately recognized as one of the great English comic characters.

K. Rowling (under the pen name of the fictitious author Newt Scamander) about the magical creatures in the Harry Potter universe. The original version, illustrated by the author herself, purports to be Harry Potter's copy of the textbook of the same name mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US), the first novel of the Harry Potter series. It includes several notes inside it supposedly handwritten by Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, detailing their own experiences with some of the beasts described, and including inside-jokes relating to the original series. In a 2001 interview with publisher Scholastic, Rowling stated that she chose the subject of magical creatures because it was a fun topic for which she had already developed much information in earlier books. Rowling's name did not appear on the cover of the first edition, the work being credited under the pen name \\"Newt Scamander\\", who, in the books, wrote this textbook as seen on Harry's supply list for his first year. The book benefits the BBC affiliated charity Comic Relief. Over 80% of the cover price of each book sold goes directly to poor children in various places around the world. According to Comic Relief, sales from this book and its companion Quidditch Through the Ages had raised over ¬£17 million by July 2009. On 12 September 2013, Warner Bros. and Rowling announced they would be producing a film inspired by the book, being the first in a series of five such films. Rowling herself was the screenwriter. She came up with a plan for a movie after Warner Bros. suggested the idea. The story features Newt Scamander as a main character and is set in New York City, 70 years before Harry's story started. The film was released on 18 November 2016. On 14 March 2017 a new edition of the book, with cover illustrations by Jonny Duddle and interior illustrations by Tomislav Tomic, was published with six new creatures and a foreword by Newt Scamander. It is assumed to be a new copy as it does not feature any handwritten notes. Proceeds from this edition are donated to Lumos as well as Comic Relief. On 7 November 2017 a new edition was published with illustrations by Olivia Lomenech Gill, featuring the aforementioned 2017 text. On 1 February 2018 a Kindle in Motion edition, featuring these illustrations with movement, was released for compatible devices. Synopsis =Original \\"for Muggles\\" version= Fantastic Beasts purports to be a reproduction of a textbook owned by Harry Potter and written by magizoologist Newt Scamander, a character in the fictional Harry Potter series. In the series, magizoology is the study of magical creatures. Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, provides the foreword and explains the purpose of the special edition of this book (the Comic Relief charity). At the end, he assures muggle readers, \\"The amusing creatures described hereafter are fictional and cannot hurt you.\\" He repeats the Hogwarts motto: \\"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus\\", Latin for \\"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\\". Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them contains the history of magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the world. Scamander says that he collected most of the information found in the book through observations made over years of travel across five continents. He notes that the first edition was commissioned in 1918 by Augustus Worme of Obscurus Books. However, it was not published until 1927. It is now in its fifty-second edition. In the Harry Potter universe, the book is a required textbook for first-year Hogwarts students, having been an approved textbook since its first publication. In his foreword to the book, Albus Dumbledore notes that it serves as an excellent reference for wizarding households in addition to its use at Hogwarts. The book features doodles and comments added by Ron Weasley. The comments would appear to have been written around the time of the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. These doodles add some extra information for fans of the series (for example the \\"Acromantula\\" entry has a comment confirming that Hogwarts is located in Scotland) along with comic relief (such as Ron stating \\"you're not kidding\\" when talking about the Hungarian Horntail being the most fearsome dragon of all, a reference to Harry's encounter with one in the fourth book). The cover design of the first edition of the book features apparent claw marks from an unidentified animal. =2017 \\"for Wizards\\" version= This edition features six new creatures: the hidebehind, the hodag, the horned serpent, the snallygaster, the thunderbird, and the wampus cat, in addition to the original 75, and the illustrations are replaced. Newt Scamander, in the foreword, explains the reason the six new creatures were not previously included is because MACUSA president Seraphina Picquery requested the more important American creatures not be mentioned to deter wizarding sightseers at a time when the US wizarding community were subject to greater persecution than their European counterparts, and after Scamander had contributed to a serious breach of the International Statute of Secrecy in New York. =Role in the Harry Potter series= The book's fictional author, Newt Scamander, does not appear in the main Harry Potter book series though his name is seen on the Marauder's Map in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Dave Gibbons, Don Simpson, and Jim Valentino also contributed art. Image Comics published the series. The six issues are an homage to the Silver Age of American comics (in particular, the early Marvel Comics), and feature spoof advertisements on the rear covers--in a manner to be repeated with a twist by Moore and Kevin O'Neill in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Marvel parody Moore's homage to Marvel clich√©s included fictionalizing himself and the artists as the \\"Sixty-Three Sweatshop\\", describing his collaborators in the same hyperbolic and alliterative mode Stan Lee used for his \\"Marvel Bullpen\\"; each was given a Lee-style nickname (\\"Affable Al,\\" \\"Sturdy Steve,\\" \\"Jaunty John,\\" etc.--Veitch has since continued to refer to himself as \\"Roarin' Rick\\"). The parody is not entirely affectionate, as the text pieces and fictional letter columns contain pointed inside jokes about the business practices of 1960s comics publishers, with \\"Affable Al\\" portrayed as a tyrant who claims credit for his employees' creations. Moore also makes reference to Lee's book Origins of Marvel Comics (and its sequels) when Affable Al recommends that readers hurry out and buy his new book How I Created Everything All By Myself and Why I Am Great. Incomplete status The series has never been finished as originally intended. When first announced, the limited series was supposed to be followed by an 80-page annual, illustrated by Jim Lee, in which the 1963 characters were sent thirty years into \\"the future\\", where they met then-contemporary 1993 characters published by Image Comics. Moore intended to make a commentary on how the air of \\"realism\\" brought to Marvel Comics in the early 1960s had paved the way for the \\"mature\\" and \\"grim and gritty\\" American comics of the 1990s. Moore has stated that his own work, Watchmen, is at least partially responsible for this trend. Moore was less than halfway through writing the script for the annual when Jim Lee announced that he was taking a year-long sabbatical from comic book art. Moore put the script aside, and after that year had passed, many things had changed. Rob Liefeld had left Image, which meant that some of his characters could not be used. Jim Lee was swamped with work and unlikely to be able to complete the work. The tide had changed, and superhero comics had begun to become less gritty, and Moore stated that his interest in writing superheroes had waned.1963 annual at Comicon In 2007, Erik Larsen was asked about the status of the project, and explained \\"Alan had a falling out with one of the creators on the 1963 project and he did not want to re-open those wounds. That ship may have sailed, sorry to say.\\" Erik Larson comment , Newsarama Moore has publicly expressed much frustration with Jim Lee for selling Wildstorm comics (which owns Moore's America's Best Comics line) to DC (whom Moore had sworn to never work for again), but it is unconfirmed whether this is what Larsen was referring to. More probably, Larsen was referencing the fact that Moore had cut ties with Steve Bissette due to personal issues.Erik Larsen quoted in Bissette has outlined how things happened from his perspective, with the problem being an interview he gave to The Comics Journal: In a later interview Bissette explained problems might have started earlier when the 1963 creators became entangled in the internal politics at Image Comics. He explained that \\"My perception of events, then and now, is that we did the 1963 series under the invite and umbrella of Image founding co-partner Jim Valentino,\\" however, \\"Rick Veitch and I found ourselves caught in the crossfire between the Image partners' pissing contests.\\" These partners \\"quickly took the initiation of the 1963 project as an open door to working with Alan on their respective projects. Again, we didn't realize at the time this also was tied up with their competitive natures: that is, it was Jim Valentino's coup that he got Alan on board via 1963, and the other Image partners wanted a piece of that action, which would also trump Jim Valentino's initial coup.\\" The comics also contained advertisements for 1963 1/2, which never surfaced either. This was a separate (unrealised) comics project created by Alex Cox and Paul Mavrides, which was previewed in a 2-page sequence in the final issue of 1963. It was not directly associated with Image's 1963 and was also advertised in unrelated publications, e.g. Science Fiction Eye. The Tomorrow Syndicate are among the characters to be featured outside of the original limited series, having made an appearance alongside Big Bang Comics' Round Table of America, in an issue of Jim Valentino's A Touch of Silver. The Fury appeared in Noble Causes: Family Secrets issue three. The Fury also appeared alongside the Syndicate in an issue of Valentino's Shadowhawk, during which the title character traveled back to the past in search of a cure for the AIDS virus. Bissette has revealed that he and Veitch had been working throughout 2009 to produce a \\"bare-bones hardcover reprint\\" of 1963 at Dynamite Entertainment but the plan fell through in January 2010. However, he did reveal that there was a \\"1998 legal agreement signed by Alan Moore, Rick Veitch and myself dividing up our creative properties\\" that left Bisette with \\"N-Man, the Fury, the Hypernaut and Commander Solo & Her Screamin' Skydogs\\" who, he thought, \\"fit nicely with a bevy of my own characters and concepts I've never had homes for: Curtis Slarch, Lo!, 'The Big Dig,' and much, much more you‚Äôve never heard of or seen because I could never interest a publisher in those projects.\\" Together they formed \\"my own invented comics universe ‚Äî the Naut Comics universe\\" which became the core of his revival of the 1963 characters he owned, to be published in late 2010 in Tales of the Uncanny ‚Äì N-Man & Friends: A Naut Comics History, Volume 1. Characters and titles Issue one introduced Mystery Incorporated, a Fantastic Four surrogate featuring Crystal Man (based on Mr Fantastic), Neon Queen (based on Invisible Woman), Kid Dynamo (based on Human Torch) and The Planet (based on The Thing). Issue two, No-one Escapes the Fury, featured The Fury, based on Spider-Man with elements taken from Daredevil, as well as Sky Solo, Lady of L.A.S.E.R., a female version of Nick Fury, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.., and mentions a character called \\"King Zero\\", who appears to be a Namor parody. Issue three, an anthology comic called Tales of the Uncanny, featured USA, Ultimate Special Agent based on Captain America, and Hypernaut, who was based on Iron Man, with elements taken from Silver Surfer, Green Lantern, Arnim Zola (in appearance), and Swamp Thing. (The name Hypernaut is possibly a twist on \\"Supernaut\\", a song by Black Sabbath, whose hits include the song \\"Iron Man.\\") Issue four, another anthology comic called Tales From Beyond, introduces readers to the Unbelievable N-Man, based on The Incredible Hulk, and Johnny Beyond, a beatnik version of Doctor Strange. Issue five was devoted to Horus, Lord of Light, which appropriates Ancient Egyptian mythology as background for a modern era superhero in the same way that The Mighty Thor appropriated Norse Mythology. Issue six told the story of the Tomorrow Syndicate, based on the Avengers. This comic brought back Horus, Lord of Light, Hypernaut, N-Man, and USA, and also introduced Infra-Man, based on Henry Pym, and Infra-Girl, based on Janet Van Dyne.

He is most remembered as the writer of the lyrics of Anglican hymn Christians awake! Salute the happy morn, which was supposedly a Christmas gift for his daughter.  Early life  Byrom was descended from an old genteel Lancashire family. Ralph Byrom came to Manchester from Lowton in 1485 and became a prosperous wool merchant. His son Adam acquired property in Salford, Darcy Lever, Bolton and Ardwick (though his wealth did not prevent his mentally ill daughter from being accused of witchcraft). Edward Byrom helped to foil a Royalist plot to seize Manchester in 1642. Byrom was born at what is now The Old Wellington Inn (part of the Old Shambles), Manchester, in 1692. (The property was then used as an office for market tolls, with accommodation on the upper floors.) The Wellington Inn, now a major tourist attraction, has a plaque in the bar area which commemorates his birth. However, some sources claim that he was born at Kersal Cell in Lower Kersal in the township of Broughton, near Salford, just outside Manchester. Kersal Cell According to BaileyBailey, Albert Edward (1950). The Gospel in Hymns. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 112‚Äì114. he was one of the tallest men in the kingdom. John Byrom His privileged background enabled him to obtain an excellent education, including The King's School, Chester, and Merchant Taylors' School, London. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow there in 1714. He subsequently travelled abroad and studied medicine at Montpellier in France.  Byrom and shorthand  Newspaper advertisement for Byrom's shorthand system from the Daily Gazetteer, 1741 Byrom invented a system of shorthandsee:Ward's book of days: February 29th Retrieved on 7 November 2008 and, having perfected this, returned to England in 1716. Some of the inhabitants of Manchester tried to persuade him to set up a medical practice in the town, but he decided that his abilities were insufficient to pursue a medical career and resolved to teach his shorthand system instead. Shortly after coming into his family inheritance in 1740, he patented his New Universal Shorthand. This system of shorthand, officially taught at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, was used by the clerk of the House of Lords. 500px On 16 June 1742, His Majesty George II secured to John Byrom, M.A., the sole right of publishing for a certain term of years (21) the art and method of shorthand invented by him. His system of shorthand was posthumously published as The Universal English Shorthand which, although superseded in the nineteenth century, marked a significant development in the history of shorthand. It was used by John (1703‚Äì1791) and Charles Wesley (1707‚Äì1788), founders of Methodism, who recorded their self- examinations in coded diaries.  Family life  The ancestral home of the Byrom family is Byrom Hall at Slag Lane in Lowton (the lane facing the hall is called Byrom Lane). He lived here from time to time, but seems to have largely resided in a town house in Manchester and at Kersal Cell. Byrom had several children, but his favourite was his daughter Dorothy, known as Dolly. In December 1745, after a romp with Dolly, he promised to write her something for Christmas; it was to be written especially for her and no one else. The delighted Dolly reminded her father of his promise each day as Christmas grew nearer. On Christmas morning, when she ran down to breakfast, she found several presents awaiting her. Among them was an envelope addressed to her in her father's handwriting. It was the first thing she opened and, to her great delight, it proved to be a Christmas carol entitled \\"Christians awake! Salute the happy morn\\". The original manuscript, headed with \\"Christmas Day for Dolly\\", was first published in Harrop's Manchester Mercury in 1746.  Literary remains  Although Byrom is probably best remembered for this Christmas carol, he was regarded by his contemporaries as a poet and a literary man. Most of his poems, the best-known of which is My spirit longeth for Thee, were religious in tone. Byrom greatly admired William Law and he often versified parts of Law's prose. The printer and novelist Samuel Richardson printed poems for Byrom, some of which were found upon Richardson‚Äôs death among his manuscripts.Gerda J. Joling-van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth- Century English Novelist, 2003, pp. 128-132. Byrom is also remembered for his epigrams and, above all, his coinage of the phrase Tweedledum and Tweedledee (in connection with a dispute about the merits of the two composers, George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini). Ralph Tomlinson authored a parody of John Byrom's poem called A Slang Pastoral. It begins \\"My Time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,\\" and it was originally published in The Spectator. John Byrom. Line engraving by Topham after D. Rasbotham  A man of mystery  Byrom did not lead an ordinary provincial life. He was a member of the Royal Society while Sir Isaac Newton was president, moving in some very influential social and intellectual circles in London and elsewhere. Modern research has revealed him to be something of a man of mystery. In the first place there is the question of his political views. It was once thought that he was a closet Jacobite, but it is now suggested that he may have acted as a double agent, the \\"Queen's Chameleon\\". His views might be summed up in the verse that he composed, in the form of a toast: :God bless the King! (I mean our faith's defender!) :God bless! (No harm in blessing) the Pretender. :But who Pretender is, and who is King, :God bless us all! That's quite another thing! Byrom died in 1763 and is buried in his family's private chapel, which is now known as Jesus Chapel in Manchester Cathedral, Manchester, England. His papers, though preserved for some time after his death, were mysteriously destroyed in the nineteenth century. A freemason,This Wooden O, at The Economist few surviving items have suggested that he may have belonged to an early quasi-masonic society, known as the \\"Cabala Club\\", similar to the Gentleman's Club of Spalding, and pursued occult interests. His library of books and manuscripts was donated to Chetham's Library by his descendant Eleanora Atherton in 1870.

The name of the expression stems from the fact that it is the quotient of the difference of values of the function by the difference of the corresponding values of its argument (the latter is (x+h)-x=h in this case). The difference quotient is a measure of the average rate of change of the function over an interval (in this case, an interval of length h). The limit of the difference quotient (i.e., the derivative) is thus the instantaneous rate of change. By a slight change in notation (and viewpoint), for an interval [a, b], the difference quotient : \\\\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} is called the mean (or average) value of the derivative of f over the interval [a, b]. This name is justified by the mean value theorem, which states that for a differentiable function f, its derivative f‚Ä≤ reaches its mean value at some point in the interval. Geometrically, this difference quotient measures the slope of the secant line passing through the points with coordinates (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). Difference quotients are used as approximations in numerical differentiation, but they have also been subject of criticism in this application. The difference quotient is sometimes also called the Newton quotient (after Isaac Newton) or Fermat's difference quotient (after Pierre de Fermat).Donald C. Benson, A Smoother Pebble: Mathematical Explorations, Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 176. Overview The typical notion of the difference quotient discussed above is a particular case of a more general concept. The primary vehicle of calculus and other higher mathematics is the function. Its \\"input value\\" is its argument, usually a point (\\"P\\") expressible on a graph. The difference between two points, themselves, is known as their Delta (ŒîP), as is the difference in their function result, the particular notation being determined by the direction of formation: *Forward difference: ŒîF(P) = F(P + ŒîP) ‚àí F(P); *Central difference: Œ¥F(P) = F(P + ¬ΩŒîP) ‚àí F(P ‚àí ¬ΩŒîP); *Backward difference: ‚àáF(P) = F(P) ‚àí F(P ‚àí ŒîP). The general preference is the forward orientation, as F(P) is the base, to which differences (i.e., \\"ŒîP\\"s) are added to it. Furthermore, *If ŒîP is finite (meaning measurable), then ŒîF(P) is known as a finite difference, with specific denotations of DP and DF(P); *If ŒîP is infinitesimal (an infinitely small amount‚Äî\\\\iota‚Äîusually expressed in standard analysis as a limit: \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta P\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!), then ŒîF(P) is known as an infinitesimal difference, with specific denotations of dP and dF(P) (in calculus graphing, the point is almost exclusively identified as \\"x\\" and F(x) as \\"y\\"). The function difference divided by the point difference is known as \\"difference quotient\\": :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta F(P)}{\\\\Delta P}=\\\\frac{F(P+\\\\Delta P)-F(P)}{\\\\Delta P}=\\\\frac{ abla F(P+\\\\Delta P)}{\\\\Delta P}.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! If ŒîP is infinitesimal, then the difference quotient is a derivative, otherwise it is a divided difference: : \\\\text{If } \\\\Delta P = \\\\mathit{ \\\\iota}: \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\Delta F(P)}{\\\\Delta P}=\\\\frac{dF(P)}{dP}=F'(P)=G(P);\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : \\\\text{If } \\\\Delta P > \\\\mathit{ \\\\iota}: \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\Delta F(P)}{\\\\Delta P}=\\\\frac{DF(P)}{DP}=F[P,P+\\\\Delta P].\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Defining the point range Regardless if ŒîP is infinitesimal or finite, there is (at least‚Äîin the case of the derivative‚Äîtheoretically) a point range, where the boundaries are P ¬± (0.5) ŒîP (depending on the orientation‚ÄîŒîF(P), Œ¥F(P) or ‚àáF(P)): :LB = Lower Boundary; UB = Upper Boundary; Derivatives can be regarded as functions themselves, harboring their own derivatives. Thus each function is home to sequential degrees (\\"higher orders\\") of derivation, or differentiation. This property can be generalized to all difference quotients. As this sequencing requires a corresponding boundary splintering, it is practical to break up the point range into smaller, equi-sized sections, with each section being marked by an intermediary point (Pi), where LB = P0 and UB = P≈Ñ, the nth point, equaling the degree/order: LB = P0 = P0 \\\\+ 0Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí (≈É-0)Œî1P; P1 = P0 \\\\+ 1Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí (≈É-1)Œî1P; P2 = P0 \\\\+ 2Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí (≈É-2)Œî1P; P3 = P0 \\\\+ 3Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí (≈É-3)Œî1P; ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì P≈Ñ-3 = P0 \\\\+ (≈É-3)Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí 3Œî1P; P≈Ñ-2 = P0 \\\\+ (≈É-2)Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí 2Œî1P; P≈Ñ-1 = P0 \\\\+ (≈É-1)Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí 1Œî1P; UB = P≈Ñ-0 = P0 \\\\+ (≈É-0)Œî1P = P≈Ñ ‚àí 0Œî1P = P≈Ñ; ŒîP = Œî1P = P1 ‚àí P0 = P2 ‚àí P1 = P3 ‚àí P2 = ... = P≈Ñ ‚àí P≈Ñ-1; ŒîB = UB ‚àí LB = P≈Ñ ‚àí P0 = Œî≈ÑP = ≈ÉŒî1P.

There are other derivative notations, but these are the most recognized, standard designations. =As a divided difference= :A divided difference, however, does require further elucidation, as it equals the average derivative between and including LB and UB: :: \\\\begin{align} P_{(tn)} & =LB+\\\\frac{TN-1}{UT-1}\\\\Delta B \\\\ =UB-\\\\frac{UT-TN}{UT-1}\\\\Delta B; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & {} \\\\qquad {\\\\color{white}.}(P_{(1)}=LB,\\\\ P_{(ut)}=UB){\\\\color{white}.} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] F'(P_\\\\tilde{a}) & =F'(LB < P < UB)=\\\\sum_{TN=1}^{UT=\\\\infty}\\\\frac{F'(P_{(tn)})}{UT}. \\\\end{align} :In this interpretation, P√£ represents a function extracted, average value of P (midrange, but usually not exactly midpoint), the particular valuation depending on the function averaging it is extracted from.

This is especially true for definite integrals that technically have (e.g.) 0 and either \\\\pi\\\\,\\\\\\\\! or 2\\\\pi\\\\,\\\\\\\\! as boundaries, with the same divided difference found as that with boundaries of 0 and \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\end{matrix} (thus requiring less averaging effort): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} F'(p) \\\\, dp & =4\\\\int_0^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} F'(p)\\\\, dp=F(2\\\\pi)-F(0)=4(F(\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\end{matrix})-F(0)), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & =2\\\\pi F[0,2\\\\pi]=2\\\\pi F'(0 < P < 2\\\\pi), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & =2\\\\pi F[0,\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\end{matrix}] =2\\\\pi F'(0 < P < \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\end{matrix}). \\\\end{align} This also becomes particularly useful when dealing with iterated and multiple integrals (ŒîA = AU ‚àí AL, ŒîB = BU ‚àí BL, ŒîC = CU ‚àí CL): : \\\\begin{align} & {} \\\\qquad \\\\int_{CL}^{CU}\\\\int_{BL}^{BU} \\\\int_{AL}^{AU} F'(r,q,p)\\\\,dp\\\\,dq\\\\,dr \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & =\\\\sum_{T\\\\\\\\!C=1}^{U\\\\\\\\!C=\\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{T\\\\\\\\!B=1}^{U\\\\\\\\!B=\\\\infty} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{T\\\\\\\\!A=1}^{U\\\\\\\\!A=\\\\infty}F^{'}(R_{(tc)}:Q_{(tb)}:P_{(ta)})\\\\frac{\\\\Delta A}{U\\\\\\\\!A}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\Delta B}{U\\\\\\\\!B}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\Delta C}{U\\\\\\\\!C}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & = F'(C\\\\\\\\!L < R < CU:BL < Q < BU:AL < P <\\\\\\\\!AU) \\\\Delta A\\\\,\\\\Delta B\\\\,\\\\Delta C. \\\\end{align} Hence, : F'(R,Q:AL < P < AU)=\\\\sum_{T\\\\\\\\!A=1}^{U\\\\\\\\!A=\\\\infty} \\\\frac{F'(R,Q:P_{(ta)})}{U\\\\\\\\!A};\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and :F'(R:BL < Q < BU:AL < P < AU)=\\\\sum_{T\\\\\\\\!B=1}^{U\\\\\\\\!B=\\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{T\\\\\\\\!A=1}^{U\\\\\\\\!A=\\\\infty}\\\\frac{F'(R:Q_{(tb)}:P_{(ta)})}{U\\\\\\\\!A}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{U\\\\\\\\!B}.\\\\,\\\\\\\\!

In this mechanism, one bond is broken and one bond is formed synchronously, i.e., in one step. SN2 is a kind of nucleophilic substitution reaction mechanism, the name referring to the Hughes-Ingold symbol of the mechanism. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow (rate-determining) step, this leads to the term substitution nucleophilic (bi-molecular) or SN2; the other major kind is SN1. Many other more specialized mechanisms describe substitution reactions. The reaction type is so common that it has other names, e.g. \\"bimolecular nucleophilic substitution\\", or, among inorganic chemists, \\"associative substitution\\" or \\"interchange mechanism\\". Reaction mechanism The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it (often denoted X), which is frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the C‚ÄìX bond and the formation of the new bond (often denoted C‚ÄìY or C‚ÄìNu) occur simultaneously through a transition state in which a carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate, and approximately sp2 hybridised. The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180¬∞ to the leaving group, since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the C‚ÄìX œÉ* antibonding orbital. The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed with inversion of the tetrahedral geometry at the central atom. If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, then this often leads to inversion of configuration (stereochemistry), called a Walden inversion. In an example of the SN2 reaction, the attack of Br‚àí (the nucleophile) on an ethyl chloride (the electrophile) results in ethyl bromide, with chloride ejected as the leaving group. :SN2 reaction of chloroethane with bromide ion SN2 attack occurs if the backside route of attack is not sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate. Therefore, this mechanism usually occurs at unhindered primary and secondary carbon centres. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon centre, the substitution will involve an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism, (an SN1 would also be more likely in this case because a sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could be formed). Factors affecting the rate of the reaction Four factors affect the rate of the reaction: =Substrate= The substrate plays the most important part in determining the rate of the reaction. This is because the nucleophile attacks from the back of the substrate, thus breaking the carbon-leaving group bond and forming the carbon-nucleophile bond. Therefore, to maximise the rate of the SN2 reaction, the back of the substrate must be as unhindered as possible. Overall, this means that methyl and primary substrates react the fastest, followed by secondary substrates. Tertiary substrates do not participate in SN2 reactions, because of steric hindrance. Structures that can form highly stable cations by simple loss of the leaving group, for example, as a resonance-stabilized carbocation, are especially likely to react via an SN1 pathway in competition with SN2\\\\. =Nucleophile= Like the substrate, steric hindrance affects the nucleophile's strength. The methoxide anion, for example, is both a strong base and nucleophile because it is a methyl nucleophile, and is thus very much unhindered. tert-Butoxide, on the other hand, is a strong base, but a poor nucleophile, because of its three methyl groups hindering its approach to the carbon. Nucleophile strength is also affected by charge and electronegativity: nucleophilicity increases with increasing negative charge and decreasing electronegativity. For example, OH‚àí is a better nucleophile than water, and I‚àí is a better nucleophile than Br‚àí (in polar protic solvents). In a polar aprotic solvent, nucleophilicity increases up a column of the periodic table as there is no hydrogen bonding between the solvent and nucleophile; in this case nucleophilicity mirrors basicity. I‚àí would therefore be a weaker nucleophile than Br‚àí because it is a weaker base. Verdict - A strong/anionic nucleophile always favours SN2 manner of nucleophillic substitution. =Solvent= The solvent affects the rate of reaction because solvents may or may not surround a nucleophile, thus hindering or not hindering its approach to the carbon atom. Polar aprotic solvents, like tetrahydrofuran, are better solvents for this reaction than polar protic solvents because polar protic solvents will hydrogen bond to the nucleophile, hindering it from attacking the carbon with the leaving group. A polar aprotic solvent with low dielectric constant or a hindered dipole end will favour SN2 manner of nucleophilic substitution reaction. Examples: dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetone etc. =Leaving group= The stability of the leaving group as an anion and the strength of its bond to the carbon atom both affect the rate of reaction. The more stable the conjugate base of the leaving group is, the more likely that it will take the two electrons of its bond to carbon during the reaction. Therefore, the weaker the leaving group is as a conjugate base, and thus the stronger its corresponding acid, the better the leaving group. Examples of good leaving groups are therefore the halides (except fluoride, due to its strong bond to the carbon atom) and tosylate, whereas HO‚àí and H2N‚àí are not. Reaction kinetics The rate of an SN2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nu‚àí] as well as the concentration of substrate, [RX]. :r = k[RX][Nu‚àí] This is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1 reaction the nucleophile attacks after the rate- limiting step is over, whereas in SN2 the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In other words, the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile. It has been shownAbsence of SN1 Involvement in the Solvolysis of Secondary Alkyl Compounds, T. J. Murphy, J. Chem. Educ.; 2009; 86(4) pp 519-24; (Article) doi: 10.1021/ed041p678 that except in uncommon (but predictable cases) primary and secondary substrates go exclusively by the SN2 mechanism while tertiary substrates go via the SN1 reaction. There are two factors which complicate determining the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions at secondary carbons: 1) Many reactions studied are solvolysis reactions where a solvent molecule‚Äìoften an alcohol, is the nucleophile. While still a second order reaction mechanistically, the reaction is kinetically first order as the concentration of the nucleophile‚Äìthe solvent molecule, is effectively constant during the reaction. This type of reaction is often called a pseudo first order reaction. 2) In reactions where the leaving group is also a good nucleophile‚Äìbromide for instance, the leaving group can perform an SN2 reaction on a substrate molecule. If the substrate is chiral, this inverts the configuration of the substrate before solvolysis, leading to a racemized product‚Äìthe product that would be expected from an SN1 mechanism. In the case of a bromide leaving group in alcoholic solvent Cowdrey et al.Relation of Steric orientation to Mechanism in Substitution Involving Halogen Atoms and Simple or Substituted Hydroxyl Groups, W. A. Cowdrey, E. D. Hughes, C. K. Ingold, S. Masterman, A. D. Scott, J. Chem. Soc.; 1937; 1252‚Äì1271. 10.1039/JR9370001252 have shown that bromide can have an SN2 rate constant 100-250 times higher than the rate constant for ethanol. Thus, after only a few percent solvolysis of an enantiospecific substrate, it becomes racemic. The examples in textbooks of secondary substrates going by the SN1 mechanism invariably involve the use of bromide (or other good nucleophile) as the leaving group have confused the understanding of alkyl nucleophilic substitution reactions at secondary carbons for 80 years[3].

E2 competition A common side reaction taking place with SN2 reactions is E2 elimination: the incoming anion can act as a base rather than as a nucleophile, abstracting a proton and leading to formation of the alkene. This pathway is favored with sterically hindered nucleophiles. Elimination reactions are usually favoured at elevated temperatures because of increased entropy. This effect can be demonstrated in the gas-phase reaction between a sulfonate and a simple alkyl bromide taking place inside a mass spectrometer:Gas Phase Studies of the Competition between Substitution and Elimination Reactions Scott Gronert Acc. Chem. Res.; 2003; 36(11) pp 848 - 857; (Article) The technique used is electrospray ionization and because it requires charged reaction products for detection the nucleophile is fitted with an additional sulfonate anionic group, non-reactive and well separated from the other anion. The product ratio of substitution and elimination product can be measured from the intensity their relative molecular ions :Competition experiment between SN2 and E2 With ethyl bromide, the reaction product is predominantly the substitution product. As steric hindrance around the electrophilic center increases, as with isobutyl bromide, substitution is disfavored and elimination is the predominant reaction. Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base. With the less basic benzoate substrate, isopropyl bromide reacts with 55% substitution. In general, gas phase reactions and solution phase reactions of this type follow the same trends, even though in the first, solvent effects are eliminated. Roundabout mechanism A development attracting attention in 2008 concerns a SN2 roundabout mechanism observed in a gas-phase reaction between chloride ions and methyl iodide with a special technique called crossed molecular beam imaging. When the chloride ions have sufficient velocity, the initial collosion of it with the methyl iodide molecule causes the methyl iodide to spin around once before the actual SN2 displacement mechanism takes place.Imaging Nucleophilic Substitution Dynamics J.

Early life Edson was born in Chester, Vermont on April 5, 1832, where his father had a farm. A descendant of the Puritans, he was the son of Soviah (n√©e Wilson) Edson and Opher Edson. He was educated at the local schools and at the Chester Academy in Vermont. Career = Business = At age twenty, Edson moved to Albany to work in his brother Cyrus' distillery, becoming a partner three years later. He left the distillery after his brother's death and started a produce business, which he relocated to New York City in 1866. His venture proved successful during the American Civil War, making Edson wealthy and enabling him to engage in civic, religious and charitable causes. He was an active Episcopalian and a member of Saint James Church, Fordham, in the Bronx. In 1873, he became one of the city's most important business leaders when he was appointed President of the New York Produce Exchange. =Politics= An anti-Tammany Democrat, in 1882 he was nominated for Mayor through the efforts of Tammany Hall boss John Murphy to avoid a Democratic Party split between organization loyalists and reformers. Upon taking office in 1883, he angered reformers by appointing Tammany men to key jobs, but he soon embraced civil service reform and other honest government measures. During his term the Brooklyn Bridge was dedicated, the Manhattan Municipal Building was constructed, and work was completed on the city's new water supply, the Croton Aqueduct. He appointed the commission responsible for the selection and location of public lands for parks in the Bronx, which came to include Van Cortlandt, Bronx, Pelham Bay, Crotona, Claremont and St. Mary's Parks, and the Mosholu, Bronx River, Pelham, and Crotona Parkways. After Edson split with Tammany the 1884 Democratic nomination for Mayor went William Russell Grace, who had also preceded Edson as Mayor, and Edson retired from politics at the completion of his term in 1885. After leaving the mayor's office, Edson returned to his business interests and continued his philanthropic activities. Personal life In 1856, Edson was married to Frances Cameron \\"Fannie\\" Wood (1835‚Äì1893), the daughter of Benjamin Howland Wood. Fannie was the granddaughter of Jethro Wood, inventor of the cast-iron moldboard plow. They owned a homestead in Morris Heights, Bronx that consisted of three acres, a stately residence, stable and barn, which he exchanged for 247 Central Park West, two doors south of the corner of 85th Street, in 1893. Together, Fannie and Franklin were the parents of: * Cyrus Edson (1857‚Äì1903), a doctor who married Virginia Churchill Paige (1853‚Äì1891). He served as the President of the Board of Health. * David Orr Edson (1862‚Äì1923), a doctor. * Henry Townsend Edson (1864‚Äì1903), who married Margarita Diehl. In 1903, Henry Edson murdered his friend's wife and then committed suicide. * Edith Edson (b. 1870), who married Willis Benner * Ethel Townsend Edson (b. 1877), who married Arthur Hoffman Van Brunt (b. 1865). He died at his home in Manhattan on September 24, 1904. He was buried in Section 15, Lot 16 at Albany Rural Cemetery, Menands, New York. =Legacy= Edson Avenue in The Bronx is named for him.

Early life and education  369x369px Makarov was born in Udomlya, Tver Oblast, USSR. He graduated from Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School in 1957 and started working at the Special Design Bureau Number One (which is now RSC Energia) as an engineer, working on the Vostok spacecraft. In 1966, he was selected for cosmonaut training.  Space program  He was originally part of the Soviet lunar program and was training with Alexei Leonov for the first human circumlunar flight. After the success of Apollo 8, however, the flight was cancelled. His first spaceflight was Soyuz 12 in 1973, a test flight to check the changes made to the Soyuz spacecraft after the Soyuz 11 disaster. His second flight was the abortive Soyuz 18a that made an emergency landing in the Altay Mountains, 21 minutes after launch. He was initially denied his spaceflight bonus pay, having to appeal directly to Leonid Brezhnev to receive it. Brezhnev was at the time the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. With his third launch on Soyuz 27 he flew to space station Salyut 6 and landed five days later with the Soyuz 26 spacecraft. His last mission was Soyuz T-3, during which several repairs on Salyut 6 were done. He also served on the backup crews for Soyuz 17 and Soyuz T-2. Altogether he spent 20 days, 17 hours, and 44 minutes in space. After his final spaceflight he continued to work for Energia, both in the Mir space station program as well as the Energia-Buran development. He received the following awards: *Four times the Order of Lenin *Order \\"Blue Nile\\" (Ethiopia) *Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR *Twice Hero of the Soviet Union *Honorary Citizen of: Dzhezkazgan (Kazakhstan), Rivne (Ukraine), Yakutsk (Russia).

The word secant comes from the Latin word secare, meaning to cut.. In the case of a circle, a secant will intersect the circle at exactly two points. A chord is the actual line segment determined by these two points, that is, the interval on the secant whose ends are at these positions.. Circles 201x201px A straight line can intersect a circle at zero, one or two points. A line intersecting in two points is called a secant line, in one point a tangent line and in no points an exterior line. A chord of a circle is the line segment that joins two distinct points of the circle. A chord is therefore contained in a unique secant line and each secant line determines a unique chord. In rigorous modern treatments of plane geometry, results that seem obvious and were assumed (without statement) by Euclid in his treatment, are usually proved. For example, Theorem (Elementary Circular Continuity): If \\\\mathcal{C} is a circle and \\\\ell a line that contains a point that is inside \\\\mathcal{C} and a point that is outside of \\\\mathcal{C} then \\\\ell is a secant line for \\\\mathcal{C}. In some situations phrasing results in terms of secant lines instead of chords can help to unify statements. As an example of this consider the result: :If two secant lines contain chords and in a circle and intersect at a point that is not on the circle, then the line segment lengths satisfy . If the point lies inside the circle this is Euclid III.35, but if the point is outside the circle the result is not contained in the Elements. However, Robert Simson following Christopher Clavius demonstrated this result, sometimes called the secant-secant theorem, in their commentaries on Euclid. Curves Working with curves more complicated than simple circles, the possibility that a line that meets the curve in two distinct points may meet the curve in further points arises. Some authors define a secant line to a curve as a line that meets the curve in two distinct points. This definition leaves open the possibility that the line may have other points of intersection with the curve. When phrased this way the definitions of a secant line for circles and curves are identical and the possibility of additional points of intersection just does not occur for a circle. =Secants and tangents= Secants may be used to approximate the tangent line to a curve, at some point , if it exists. Define a secant to a curve by two points, and , with fixed and variable. As approaches along the curve, if the slope of the secant approaches a limit value, then that limit defines the slope of the tangent line at . The secant lines are the approximations to the tangent line. In calculus, this idea is the geometric definition of the derivative. The tangent line at point is a secant line of the curve A tangent line to a curve at a point may be a secant line to that curve if it intersects the curve in at least one point other than . Another way to look at this is to realize that being a tangent line at a point is a local property, depending only on the curve in the immediate neighborhood of , while being a secant line is a global property since the entire domain of the function producing the curve needs to be examined. Sets and -secants The concept of a secant line can be applied in a more general setting than Euclidean space. Let be a finite set of points in some geometric setting. A line will be called an -secant of if it contains exactly points of . For example, if is a set of 50 points arranged on a circle in the Euclidean plane, a line joining two of them would be a 2-secant (or bisecant) and a line passing through only one of them would be a 1-secant (or unisecant). A unisecant in this example need not be a tangent line to the circle. This terminology is often used in incidence geometry and discrete geometry. For instance, the Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem of incidence geometry states that if points of Euclidean geometry are not collinear then there must exist a 2-secant of them. And the original orchard-planting problem of discrete geometry asks for a bound on the number of 3-secants of a finite set of points. Finiteness of the set of points is not essential in this definition, as long as each line can intersect the set in only a finite number of points.

Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers, and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) service records. The software comes built- in with Apple's macOS and iOS operating systems. Bonjour can also be installed onto computers running Microsoft Windows. Bonjour components may also be included within other software such as iTunes and Safari. After its introduction in 2002 with Mac OS X 10.2 as Rendezvous, the software was renamed in 2005 to Bonjour following an out-of-court trademark dispute settlement. Overview Bonjour provides a general method to discover services on a local area network. The software is widely used throughout macOS, and allows users to set up a network without any configuration. it is used to find printers and file-sharing servers. Notable applications using Bonjour include: *iTunes to find shared music *iPhoto to find shared photos *iChat, Adobe Systems Creative Suite 3, Proteus, Adium, Fire, Pidgin, Skype, Vine Server, and Elgato EyeTV to communicate with multiple clients *Gizmo5 to find other users on the local network *TiVo Desktop to find digital video recorders and shared-media libraries (deprecated, unsupported c. 2013) *SubEthaEdit to find document collaborators *Solidworks and PhotoView 360 used for managing licenses *Things and OmniFocus to synchronize projects and tasks across the Mac desktop and the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch *Safari to find local web servers and configuration pages for local devices Software such as Bonjour Browser or iStumbler, both for macOS, can be used to view all services declared by these applications. Apple's \\"Remote\\" application for iPhone and iPod Touch also uses Bonjour to establish connection to iTunes libraries via Wi-Fi. Bonjour only works within a single broadcast domain, which is usually a small area, without special DNS configuration. macOS, Bonjour for Windows and AirPort Base Stations may be configured to use Wide Area Bonjour which allows for wide area service discovery via an appropriately configured DNS server. Applications generally implement Bonjour services using standard TCP/IP calls, rather than in the operating system. Although macOS provides various Bonjour services, Bonjour also works on other operating systems. Apple has made the source code of the Bonjour multicast DNS responder, the core component of service discovery, available as a Darwin open source project. The project provides source code to build the responder daemon for a wide range of platforms, including Mac OS 9, macOS, Linux, *BSD, Solaris, VxWorks, and Windows. Apple also provides a user-installable set of services called Bonjour for Windows and Java libraries. Licensing Bonjour is released under a terms-of-limited-use license by Apple. It is freeware for clients, though developers and software companies who wish to redistribute it as part of a software package or use the Bonjour logo may need a licensing agreement. The source code for mDNSResponder is available under the Apache License. File 'LICENSE' within each mDNSResponder source code download. Naming Apple originally introduced the Bonjour software in August 2002 as part of Mac OS X 10.2 under the name \\"Rendezvous\\". On August 27, 2003 Tibco Software Inc announced that it had filed a lawsuit for trademark infringement. Tibco had an enterprise application integration product called TIBCO Rendezvous on the market since 1994 and stated that it had tried to come to an agreement with Apple Computer. In July 2004 Apple Computer and Tibco reached an out-of-court settlement; specifics of the settlement were not released to the public. On April 12, 2005, Apple announced the renaming of Rendezvous to \\"Bonjour\\". The current name Bonjour is French for the morning or afternoon greeting, \\"good day\\". The previous name Rendezvous is French for \\"meeting\\", \\"appointment\\" or \\"date\\". Other implementations Bonjour version 2.0, released on February 24, 2010, works with Microsoft Windows 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10. Systems use it primarily to facilitate the installation, configuration, and use of network printers, and thus it runs from startup. When Bonjour is fully implemented on Windows, some features‚Äîsuch as iChat‚Äîallow for communication between Windows and Mac OS. Bonjour for Windows also adds zeroconf capabilities to Internet Explorer, and provides a zeroconf implementation to Java VMs. Some third-party applications, such as Adobe's Photoshop CS3 suite, also come bundled with Bonjour to take advantage of zeroconf technology. Installers on Windows systems normally place Bonjour files in a folder called \\"Bonjour\\" within the \\"Program Files\\" folder. It modifies Windows system- registry entries related to internal network configuration and operation. Bonjour runs as mDNSResponder.exe. Communications across the network take place over UDP port 5353, which may require reconfiguring some personal or corporate firewalls that block Bonjour packets. A full installation of Bonjour for Windows will include a plug-in for Internet Explorer, a printer wizard, and the network communication services. Not all components are included when installed as part of a third-party application or as a component of other Apple software such as iTunes. Some VPN clients are configured so that local network services are unavailable to a computer when VPN software is active and connected. In such a case no local zeroconf services are available to Bonjour or any other zeroconf implementation. In September 2008, two security vulnerabilities were found in Bonjour for Windows. Certain installations of Bonjour for Windows lack an uninstaller and do not display a human-readable entry in the Windows services listing. In 32- and 64-bit releases of Windows 7, some older but still available versions of Bonjour services can disable all network connectivity by adding an entry of 0.0.0.0 as the default gateway. This was a bug reported in 2013. The open-source IM clients Pidgin, Kopete and Adium support the Bonjour IM protocol, as does the closed-source Trillian client. Browsers A number of browsers allow an end-user to graphically explore the devices found using Bonjour. = Discovery / Bonjour Browser = Discovery is a Creative Commons-licensed macOS application that displays all services declared using Bonjour. The program was originally called Rendezvous Browser, but changed its name in version 1.5.4 after Apple changed the protocol's name to Bonjour; since version 2.0, it has been renamed again, to Discovery. For certain protocols, double-clicking a list item will launch the associated helper. Version 1.5.6 was the first universal binary release. Future versions will allow users to completely define a service, instead of relying on the author to do so. Bonjour Browser was recommended for service discovery in MacAddict #123. Discovery is available on the Apple App Store. =JBonjourBrowser= A student research project at Columbia University produced a Java-based system to match the functionality of Bonjour Browser, called JBonjourBrowser. JBonjourBrowser is open-source and available under the GPL. JBonjourBrowser was built to emulate the functionality of Bonjour Browser, and at the same time work on multiple platforms. It requires Apple's Bonjour Java library to run. =Bonjour Browser for Windows= A native Windows application offers similar functions to Bonjour Browser for Mac OS.

Concept and production Vision On was conceived and developed by BBC producers Ursula Eason and Patrick Dowling to replace a monthly series For Deaf Children (1952‚Äì64), a programme paced slowly enough for children to read captions and subtitles. It was noted in surveys that a favourite for deaf children was Top of the Pops, due to its lively and fast-moving format and that even the profoundly deaf could still enjoy the music's lower frequency notes. There was initial disagreement as to whether lip-reading or British Sign Language would be more appropriate. Eventually it was decided that, since the new programme was intended as entertainment rather than education, communication would be entirely visual, the amount of text would be severely limited and, except for a few repeated statements, speech would be abandoned altogether. The title Vision On referred to the illuminated sign in studios indicating that cameras were live. Normally another sign \\"Sound On\\" would follow, but the titles for Vision On deliberately omitted this. The programme's logo is made up from the handwritten words of the title and their reflection, stylised into an animated character. The aim of the programme was to entertain but also to encourage imagination, with a fast-paced flow of contrasting ideas, both sane and silly. This mixture was an apparent success as the series ran for twelve years and, while retaining a commitment to the deaf, attracted a wider following and gained several awards including the international Prix Jeunesse and the BAFTA Award for Specialised Programmes (Patrick Dowling 1974). Presenters A full list of contributors can be found, but the main presenters were: *Pat Keysell: an actress who also taught deaf children *Tony Hart: artist, who made pictures in a variety of sizes and media, and encouraged children to submit their own paintings to \\"The Gallery\\", which they did by the thousands *Ben Benison and Sylvester McCoy (credited as Sylveste McCoy): mime artistes *Wilf Lunn: eccentric inventor of equally eccentric machines *David Cleveland: appeared in film sequences as the Prof Segments Besides the scenes with Hart, Keysell and the others doing artwork (which in later years appeared on the screen as the artwork being made without any hands), Vision On had many memorable segments: *\\"The Gallery\\" ‚Äì A section consisting of artwork sent into the show by viewers, with the name and age of the artist being shown alongside the artwork. Often the artwork shown on a specific show coincided with the theme of the show. At the end of this segment, Keysell would thank everyone for sending in their pictures and apologize for being unable to return them, but did state there was \\"a prize for any that we show\\". However, it remains unknown as to what exactly the prize was. *\\"The Burbles\\" ‚Äì A couple of unseen people living inside a grandfather clock who converse in speech bubbles, mainly telling puns. Occasionally they are heard speaking the lines as if they are underwater, but other times there are just the speech bubbles. *\\"The Prof\\" ‚Äì A man in a white lab coat (aka film-makers David Cleveland, Tony Amies and David Wyatt) who is usually outdoors doing various humorous things. *\\"Humphrey the Tortoise\\" ‚Äì Much like the Burbles, Humphrey talks of something specific (usually a pun or joke) either to himself or someone else. His speech, as well as the other person's if there is one, is shown on screen with no audio. *\\"The Digger\\" ‚Äì A \\"cut-out\\" cartoon man designed and animated by Bill Mather and George Dunning. Other Animators, Bob Baker, Dave Martin and Laurie Booth. Each week on a construction site he digs into the dirt with a shovel until something interesting is dug up. *\\"The Animated Clock\\" ‚Äì An animated cuckoo clock that is either showing signs of trouble or whose parts come to life like a human being, sometimes it would also feature a small animated man wandering around a surreal animated world and would interact with the clock's bird. *\\"The Woofumpuss\\" ‚Äì One running gag in later episodes involved one of the cast members frantically chasing a fuzzy worm trying to catch it to no avail and occasionally messing up the artwork of Hart and Keysell. *\\"Aardman\\" \\\\- Various Clay animated segments created by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, including the Greeblies, who served as early precursors of their later creation, Morph, and Aard-man, a superhero whose name would later become the name of Lord and Sproxton's company, Aardman Animations. Music Despite its intended hearing-impaired audience, the show made extensive use of music for the benefit of hearing viewers watching the show. Notable themes included: * The opening theme was \\"Accroche-Toi, Caroline\\" by Caravelli (recorded by the Paris Studio Group). * The closing theme was \\"Java\\" in the versions recorded by Al Hirt and Bert Kaempfert. * \\"The Gallery\\" ‚Äì \\"Left Bank Two\\" by Wayne Hill (recorded by The Noveltones) for De Wolfe Music is best remembered for this sequence. When Take Hart started, \\"Left Bank Two\\" became the opening theme tune and \\"Cavatina\\" became the \\"Gallery\\" music for the show instead. * \\"The Burbles\\" theme \\"Goofy\\" by Cliff Johns. * \\"Humphrey the tortoise\\" theme \\"Merry Ocarina\\" by Pierre Arvay. * \\"Animated Clock\\" scenes used \\"Gurney Slade\\" by Max Harris (the theme music from the TV series The Strange World of Gurney Slade) and \\"Keystone Capers\\" by Eric Peters. * \\"The Digger\\" music was \\"Elephant Dance\\" by Harry Pitch. * \\"The Prof\\" - the two most commonly used themes were \\"Comedy Cocktails 2\\" and \\"Comedy Cocktails 4\\" by Paul Gerard, from the Chappell recorded music library. * \\"Interlude\\" music was \\"Rampage\\" by Mike Vickers from the KPM music library. Co-productions Vision On was co- produced in France with ORTF, in Canada with Radio-Canada under the title D√©clic and in Sweden as √ñgon Blik. Distribution The programme was shown in many other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Jordan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden & Switzerland. In the United States, many PBS stations, and a few commercial stations, aired Vision On during the 1970s and 1980s. Some of these stations, such as KOMO-TV in Seattle, taped their own episodes, which were seen along with the BBC- produced shows. End of production Series' producer Dowling eventually found that the flow of new ideas became more and more difficult to sustain, and after twelve years decided to close the programme while it was still at its height. Dowling and Hart continued to make arts programmes, starting with Take Hart (which kept \\"The Gallery\\" segment), continuing with Hartbeat during the 1980s and 1990s, and then the BBC's current children's art programme, SMart.

Peng was born into a poor peasant family, and received several years of primary education before his family's poverty forced him to suspend his education at the age of ten, and to work for several years as a manual laborer. When he was sixteen, Peng became a professional soldier. Over the next ten years Peng served in the armies of several Hunan-based warlord armies, raising himself from the rank of private second class to major. In 1926 Peng's forces joined the Kuomintang, and Peng was first introduced to communism. Peng participated in the Northern Expedition, and supported Wang Jingwei's attempt to form a left-leaning Kuomintang government based in Wuhan. After Wang was defeated, Peng briefly rejoined Chiang Kai-shek's forces before joining the Chinese Communist Party, allying himself with Mao Zedong and Zhu De. Peng was one of the most senior generals who defended the Jiangxi Soviet from Chiang's attempts to capture it, and his successes were rivaled only by Lin Biao. Peng participated in the Long March, and supported Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference, which was critical to Mao's rise to power. During the 1937‚Äì1945 Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng was one of the strongest supporters of pursuing a ceasefire with the Kuomintang in order to concentrate China's collective resources on resisting the Japanese Empire. Peng was the senior commander in the combined Kuomintang-Communist efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Shanxi in 1937; and, by 1938, was in command of 2/3 of the Eighth Route Army. In 1940, Peng conducted the Hundred Regiments Offensive, a massive Communist effort to disrupt Japanese logistical networks across northern China. The Hundred Regiments Offensive was modestly successful, but political disputes within the Communist Party led to Peng being recalled to Yan'an, and he spent the rest of the war without an active command. After the Japanese surrendered, in 1945, Peng was given command of Communist forces in Northwest China. He was the most senior commander responsible for defending the Communist leadership in Shaanxi from Kuomintang forces, saving Mao from being captured at least once. Peng eventually defeated the Kuomintang in Northwest China, captured huge amounts of military supplies, and actively incorporated the huge area, including Xinjiang, into the People's Republic of China. Peng was one of the few senior military leaders who supported Mao's suggestions to involve China directly in the 1950‚Äì1953 Korean War, and he served as the direct commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the first half of the war (though Mao and Zhou Enlai were technically more senior). Peng's experiences in the Korean War convinced him that the Chinese military had to become more professional, organized, and well-equipped in order to prepare itself for the conditions of modern technical warfare. Because the Soviet Union was the only communist country then equipped with a fully modern, professional army, Peng attempted to reform China's military on the Soviet model over the next several years, making the army less political and more professional (contrary to the political goals of Mao). Peng resisted Mao's attempts to develop a personality cult throughout the 1950s; and, when Mao's economic policies associated with the Great Leap Forward caused a nationwide famine, Peng became critical of Mao's leadership. The rivalry between Peng and Mao culminated in an open confrontation between the two at the 1959 Lushan Conference. Mao won this confrontation, labeled Peng as a leader of an \\"anti-Party clique\\", and purged Peng from all influential positions for the rest of his life. Peng lived in virtual obscurity until 1965, when the reformers Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping supported Peng's limited return to government, developing military industries in Southwest China. In 1966, following the advent of the Cultural Revolution, Peng was arrested by Red Guards. From 1966‚Äì1970, radical factions within the Communist Party, led by Lin Biao and Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, singled out Peng for national persecution, and Peng was publicly humiliated in numerous large-scale struggle sessions and subjected to physical and psychological torture in organized efforts to force Peng to confess his \\"crimes\\" against Mao Zedong and the Communist Party. In 1970 Peng was formally tried and sentenced to life imprisonment, and he died in prison in 1974. After Mao died in 1976, Peng's old ally, Deng Xiaoping, emerged as China's paramount leader. Deng led an effort to formally rehabilitate people who had been unjustly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and Peng was one of the first leaders to be posthumously rehabilitated, in 1978. In modern China, Peng is considered one of the most successful and highly respected generals in the history of the Chinese Communist Party.  Early life  = Childhood = Peng was born in 1898 in the village of Shixiang, Xiangtan County, Hunan. His personal name at birth was \\"Dehua\\". Peng's family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land, on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated a bean curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: that everyone should have enough food to eat, that women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as \\"lower-middle peasant\\".Domes 10‚Äì11, 140 From 1905‚Äì1907, Peng was enrolled in a traditional Confucian primary school. In 1908 Peng attended a modern primary school; but, at the age of ten, was forced to withdraw from this school due to his family's deteriorating financial situation. In 1905‚Äì1906, there was a severe drought in Hunan. Peng's mother died in 1905, and Peng's six-month-old brother died of hunger. Peng's father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food, and to pawn most of his family's land. When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908, he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village. From 1908‚Äì1910, Peng took a job looking after a pair of water buffaloes. When Peng's grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng left home and worked at a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought and famine, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer for the construction of a dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.Domes 11‚Äì12 = Service in warlord armies = Peng enlisted as a private second class soldier, with a monthly wage of 5.5 yuan, 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family. Within seven months he was promoted to private first class, with a monthly wage of 6 yuan, 3 yuan of which he sent to his family. One of Peng's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, who influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification. When another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen, against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade. In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but was released after two weeks. In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi's forces drove enemy troops out of Hunan in July 1920, capturing the provincial capital of Changsha.Domes 12‚Äì14 Peng participated in a failed mutiny over pay, but was pardoned. In August 1921 Peng was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, and became acting company commander several weeks later. While stationed in a village in Nanxian, Peng noticed that the poor were being mistreated by a local landlord, and encouraged them to establish an \\"association to help the poor\\". When the local villagers hesitated, Peng ordered his soldiers to arrest the landlord and execute him. Peng was reprimanded for his actions, but not demoted or reassigned. After the incident, Peng began to think seriously about leaving the service of his provincial warlord army. In February 1922, after applying for extended unpaid leave, Peng and several other officers traveled to Guangdong to seek employment in the army of the Kuomintang.Domes 14‚Äì15 Peng's impression of the Kuomintang in 1922 was not favorable, and he left Guangzhou with the intention of settling back in Hunan as a farmer. Peng returned to his home village by sea via Shanghai (then the farthest he had ever been from his home village), and farmed with his father for three months on land which his father had bought with money that Peng had sent home, but Peng did not find this occupation satisfying. When one of Peng's old comrades suggested that Peng apply to the local Hunan Military Academy to seek employment as a formally trained professional officer, Peng accepted. Peng successfully gained admission in August 1922, using the personal name \\"Dehuai\\" for the first time. In August 1923, after nine months of training, Peng graduated from the academy and rejoined his old regiment with the rank of captain. He was promoted to acting battalion commander in April 1924.Domes 15‚Äì16 In 1924 Tang Shengzhi aligned himself with northern warlords against the warlord controlling Guangdong, who was aligned with the Kuomintang. Peng conducted skirmishes along the Hunan-Guangdong border for nine months, but reorganized his battalion along pro-Kuomintang political lines in 1925. In late 1925 Chiang Kai-shek established the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) and led the Kuomintang to take control of Guangdong. Tang then aligned himself with Chiang and joined him in the Northern Expedition, an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords. The Hunanese army was reorganized, and Peng was promoted to the rank of major. When Wu Peifu invaded Hunan and occupied Changsha, Chiang sent the NRA to Hunan, beginning the Northern Expedition. Peng's forces then joined the Kuomintang, though Peng never joined the party as a formal member. It wasn't until after Peng joined the Kuomintang, in 1925, that he first heard of the Communist Party.Domes 16‚Äì18 = Kuomintang officer = Between July 1926 and March 1927 Peng campaigned in Hunan, participating in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan. Under general He Jian, Peng participated in the Battle of Fengtai, in which Kuomintang forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu. In 1927, Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left-leaning Kuomintang government in Wuhan that threatened Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. Tang Shengzhi, who Peng served under, aligned himself with Wang, and Peng was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and regimental commander. After Tang's forces were decisively defeated by Chiang, Peng commanded the rear guard, protecting the retreat of Tang's forces back into Hunan.Domes 17‚Äì18 In 1927 Peng was approached several times by Communist Party members, some of which were old friends, who attempted to recruit him into the Communist Party. In August 1927 Peng was approached by an old military comrade, : Peng was sympathetic, but could not decide to join the Party. On October 12, Peng was approached by Duan Dechang, a Communist Party representative: Peng again expressed sympathy and interest, but at that time considered himself a member of the \\"Kuomintang left wing\\", and could not yet bring himself to break with the party. Peng considered joining the Communist Party for some time, met Duan again later that October, and began to study basic communist theory. Peng secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party in mid-February 1928.Domes 18‚Äì19 In February 1928 Peng joined general Ho Chien when Ho defected back to Chiang's forces, and gained a promotion to full colonel after rejoining Chiang. After rejoining Chiang's Nanjing government, Peng was stationed in the mountainous Pingjiang County, northwest of Changsha. His orders were to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area following the Shanghai massacre of 1927. Because Peng had secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party, he instead kept his unit passive and began to organize local Communist Party branches. Peng made contact with local communist guerrillas, nominally attached to the forces of Mao Zedong and Zhu De, and decided to issue a pronouncement in favor of the Communists on July 18, 1928.Domes 17‚Äì20 On July 22, 1928 Peng's forces, approximately 2000 men, occupied Pingjiang County, arresting and executing the county magistrate and over 100 landlords and local militia commanders. On July 23 Peng declared the establishment of the \\"Hunan Provincial Soviet Government\\", formally aligning himself with Mao and Zhu. On July 29 Peng's former superior, general Ho Chien, attacked Peng's forces, inflicting heavy casualties. By September, Peng's forces were driven into the mountains, and by October only several hundred men remained. Peng then abandoned his bases and left to join Mao and Zhu at their base in the Jinggang Mountains. Peng's forces successfully joined Mao and Zhu in November 1928. Some of Peng's subordinates in the rebellion survived and became important military figures themselves, including generals Huang Kecheng and Peng Shaohui.Domes 20, 49  Red Army commander  By his mid-30s, Peng was one of the most senior generals in the Jiangxi Soviet (1934 - 1935). = Defending the Jiangxi Soviet = After joining forces with communist guerrillas, one of Peng's first actions was to save Mao, whose forces were being encircled by Kuomintang units: Peng broke the encirclement and drove the enemy off. Peng then met with Zhu and Mao, and they reorganized their forces and decided to form a base area around the Ruijin, Jiangxi, an agricultural city that was only defended by weak warlord units. Zhu and Mao occupied the area, informally beginning the Jiangxi Soviet in January 1929.Domes 29 Peng remained behind to guard Jinggangshan with a force of 800 soldiers, but withdrew from the area when it was attacked by a Hunanese Kuomintang force of 25,000 soldiers, joining Zhu and Mao in Ruijin in March. Although he had saved his force from destruction, he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing. Peng returned to Jinggangshan with a force of 1,000 men later that year, occupying the area after the Kuomintang withdrew. In mid-1929 Peng's forces merged with the forces of two local bandit groups, but conflicts arose over supplies and the command structure, and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929. One of the bandit leaders was captured and executed by Peng, and the other committed suicide. The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng's unit, bringing its strength up to 2,000 men. Peng then organized a series of increasingly ambitious raids into southern Hunan throughout 1929 and 1930, capturing an increasing amount of supplies and attracting more recruits.Domes 29‚Äì30 On July 13, 1930, the de facto leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Lisan, issued a general order for communist units around China to \\"conquer one provincial capital\\" as a signal for a \\"nationwide revolutionary storm\\". Peng took these general orders seriously, and launched an attack on Hunan's capital, Changsha, on July 25, with 17,000 soldiers under his command, and with the support of another 10,000 guerillas. Changsha was then defended by general Ho Chien, Peng's former superior. Peng's forces broke through the Kuomintang lines on July 28, and occupied Changsha proper on July 30, which Ho hastily evacuated. On August 1 Peng declared the establishment of a \\"Hunan Provincial Soviet Government\\", with Li Lisan (who was living in the French concession area in Shanghai) named chairman, and Peng himself as vice- chairman. On August 5, Ho counterattacked with a force of 35,000 men. Peng suffered 7,500 casualties, and was forced to withdraw back to Jinggangshan. On September 1, Peng again attempted to capture Changsha, but this attack was halted on the outskirts of the city with heavy casualties. Mao and Zhu kept their own forces from assisting Peng during his attempts to take Changsha, and Peng withdrew his forces into the Jiangxi Soviet in late 1930.Domes 31‚Äì32 Peng was one of the most important generals active in defending the Jiangxi Soviet, taking a leading role in defeating Chiang Kai-shek's first three Encirclement Campaigns, from December 1930 ‚Äì May 1931. His successes were outmatched only by Lin Biao. On November 7, Peng was named to the Central Military Commission and to the Central Executive Committee of the Jiangxi Soviet, the first time that he had been named to a position of political leadership within the communist movement. After the consolidation of the Jiangxi Soviet, a number of USSR-trained Communist Party leaders arrived and took power in the Soviet: Peng, like most communist military leaders, supported their leadership until the Jiangxi Soviet was eventually overrun. In August 1933, Peng was named Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission; and, in January 1934, Peng was appointed as an alternate member to the Sixth CCP Central Committee. Peng continued the defense of the Jiangxi Soviet throughout the early 1930s. In August 1933, after the indecisive Fourth Encirclement Campaign, Peng broke through Kuomintang defenses and conquered a large area of western Fujian, capturing great quantities of arms and ammunition.Domes 33‚Äì36 = Long March = In October 1933 Chiang Kai-shek took command of nearly 800,000 soldiers, leading the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against the Red Army's force of 150,000 men. By September 1934 the Fifth Encirclement Campaign was largely successful, and Peng's own units suffered heavy casualties defending the Soviet, shrinking from 35,000 to around 20,000 men. On October 20, 1934 the communists broke out of Chiang's encirclement and began the Long March. Of the 18,000 men under Peng's command when the March began, only about 3,000 remained when Peng's forces reached their eventual destination in Shaanxi on October 20, 1935.Domes 36‚Äì37 Peng was a strong supporter of Mao's rise to power during the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. Peng continued to consolidate the communists' base area after arriving in Shaanxi, campaigning in neighboring Shanxi and Gansu. In April 1937, Peng was named vice commander-in- chief of all Chinese communist forces, outranked only by Zhu De, who was named commander-in-chief. Peng's promotion was supported by Lin Biao, who had been actively supporting Peng for promotions to senior leadership as early as May 1934.Salisbury 191‚Äì192 In early 1935 Lin responded to widespread discontent within the Red Army over Mao's evasive tactics (which were perceived inside the Red Army as unnecessarily exhausting) by publicly proposing that Peng take overall command of the Red Army; but Mao, who had recently been promoted to the position, attacked Peng and Lin for challenging him and successfully retained his position.Teiwes 85 In October 1935, following the last major battle between the KMT and the Red Army, Mao wrote and dedicated a poem to Peng. (The poem was not published until 1947).Yang Lijie : The mountains are high, the road is long and full of potholes, : Many soldiers are moving to and fro, : Who is the courageous one, striking from his horse in all directions? : None other than our great General Peng! In 1936 the American journalist, Edgar Snow, stayed for several days at Peng's compound in Yuwang while Peng was campaigning in Ningxia, and had long conversations with him. Snow wrote two whole chapters about Peng in his book, Red Star Over China. He wrote more about Peng than any other individual, except for Mao Zedong.Snow 135 = Second Sino-Japanese War = Peng Dehuai commanded the largest communist offensive in the war against Japan. After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan formally went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party declared a united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Luochuan Conference (), Mao believed that the united front should be used as a feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.Domes 37‚Äì38 When the Japanese invaded Shanxi, the Red Army (renamed the Eighth Route Army) assisted the Kuomintang warlord, Yan Xishan, in resisting the Japanese, and Peng travelled to the provincial capital of Taiyuan with Zhou Enlai to coordinate tactics. After the Japanese advanced towards Taiyuan on September 13, 1937, Peng directed overall operations from a base in Wutaishan, but was called from duty to attend a Politburo meeting on December 13. At the meeting, Peng advocated a greater material commitment to the defense of Shanxi, but Mao disagreed and wanted the Red Army to reduce its commitment to fighting the Japanese. In 1938, after Mao's rival, Zhang Guotao, defected to the Kuomintang, Peng moved closer to Mao's position. In late 1938, Peng set up a base in Taihangshan, on the borders of Shanxi and Hebei, and directed guerrilla operations in both provinces. From Taihangshan, Peng commanded 2/3 of the Eighth Route Army, approximately 100,000 soldiers.Domes 38‚Äì39 In July 1940 Peng was given overall command of the largest communist operation of the anti-Japanese war, the Hundred Regiments Offensive. 200,000 regular troops from the Eighth Route Army participated in this operation, supported by 200,000 irregular communist guerrillas. From August 20 ‚Äì October 5, 1940, communist forces destroyed large numbers of bridges, tunnels, and railroad tracks in Japanese-occupied China, and inflicted relatively heavy Japanese casualties. From October 6 ‚Äì December 5, the Japanese counterattacked, and the communists mostly repelled the counterattack successfully. Peng's operation was successful in disrupting Japanese communication lines and logistics networks, which were not fully restored until 1942, but the communists suffered heavy losses,Domes 39‚Äì42 In communist sources, the Japanese casualties have two figures, one of which is 20645 and the other of which is 12645. Foreign sources give figures of 20900.Garver 120 In early 1941, the Japanese began a large-scale effort to drive Peng from his base in Taihangshan, and Peng relocated closer to the communist base in Yan'an in late 1941. After being recalled to Yan'an, Peng was subjected to a political indoctrination campaign in which he was criticized as an \\"empiricist\\" for his good relations with the Comintern, and only survived professionally through an unconditional conversion to Mao's leadership.Barnouin and Yu 91 Mao ordered Peng to be criticized for forty days for the \\"failings\\" of the Hundred Regiments Campaign (even though Mao had supported it, and afterwards praised its successes). Peng was not allowed to reply, and was forced to make a self-criticism.Teiwes 86 Privately, Peng resented Mao's criticism of him, and in 1959 once told Mao: \\"At Yan'an, you fucked my mother for forty days.\\"Xiao 3 From 1942‚Äì1945, Peng's role in the war was mostly political, and he supported Mao very closely. In June 1944 Peng was part of a team that held conferences with American military personnel that visited Yan'an as part of the Dixie Mission, briefing the Americans about the military situation in Japanese-occupied China.Barnouin and Yu 96 =Defeating the Kuomintang= The Japanese surrendered on September 3, 1945, ending China's war with Japan and beginning the final stage of the Chinese Civil War. In October Peng took command of troops in northern China, occupied Inner Mongolia, and accepted the surrender of Japanese soldiers there. In March 1946, Communist forces (1.1 million soldiers) were renamed the \\"People's Liberation Army\\". Peng himself was placed in command of 175,000 soldiers, organized as the \\"Northwest Field Army\\", most of which had been under the command of He Long during the war against Japan. He then became Peng's second- in-command. Peng's notable subordinates in the Northwest Field Army included Zhang Zongxun and Wang Zhen.Domes 42‚Äì43 Peng's forces were the most poorly armed of the newly reorganized army, but were responsible for the area around the communist capital, Yan'an. In March 1947, the Kuomintang general, Hu Zongnan, invaded this area with 260,000 soldiers. Hu's forces were among the best-trained and most well-supplied Nationalist units,Domes 45 but one of Zhou Enlai's spies was able to provide Peng with information about Hu's strategic plans, his forces' troop distributions, strength, and positions, and details about the air cover available to Hu.Barnouin and Yu 109 Peng was forced to abandon Yan'an in late March, but resisted Hu's forces long enough for Mao and other senior Party leaders to evacuate safely. Mao wanted Peng to provoke a decisive confrontation with Hu immediately, but Peng dissuaded him, and by April Mao agreed that Peng's objective was to \\"keep the enemy on the run... tire him out completely, reduce his food supplies, and then look for an opportunity to destroy him\\".Lew 65 On May 4 Peng's forces attacked an isolated supply depot in northeast Shaanxi, arrested its commander, and captured food reserves, 40,000 army uniforms, and a collection of arms that included over a million pieces of artillery.Barnouin and Yu 112 Peng's forces were pushed back to the border of Inner Mongolia, but finally managed to decisively defeat Hu's forces in August, in the Battle of Shajiadian(Ê≤ôÂÆ∂Â∫óÊàòÂΩπ), saving Mao and other members from the Central committee from being taken prisoner. Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang forces out of Shaanxi in February 1948. Between 1947 and September 22, 1949, Peng's forces occupied Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. His forces repeatedly defeated, but were not able to destroy, the forces of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949. In October Peng's forces, led directly by Wang Zhen, invaded Xinjiang. Most of Xinjiang's defenders surrendered peacefully, and were incorporated as a new unit in Peng's army, but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years. After the People's Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and Administrative Commission and Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of Xinjiang, with Wang Zhen as his deputy. This appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, an area of over five million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) but under thirty million people. Peng's forces continued their gradual occupation of Xinjiang, which they completed in September 1951.Domes 45‚Äì46 The Korean War A statue of Peng now stands on the Chinese border with Korea, on the place that Peng crossed into North Korea in 1950. North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. After receiving its endorsement from the United Nations, the United States landed its first troops in Korea on September 15. On October 1, the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, UN forces crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. There was some disagreement within China's leadership about how to react to the American push to the Chinese border: Mao and Zhou wanted direct military intervention, while most Chinese leaders believed that China should not enter the war unless China was directly attacked. Lin Biao was Mao's first choice to lead the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) into Korea, but Lin refused, citing his bad health.Barnouin and Yu 145‚Äì146 Mao then sought the support of Peng, who had not yet taken a strong position, to lead the PVA. Peng flew to Beijing from Xi'an (where he was still administering northwest China and directing the incorporation of Xinjiang into the PRC), and arrived on October 4. Peng listened to both sides of the debate, and on October 5 decided to support Mao. Peng's support for Mao's position changed the atmosphere of the meeting, and most leaders changed their positions to support a direct Chinese intervention in the Korean War. On October 5 Peng was named the Commander and the Commissar of the People's Volunteer Army and held both titles until the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953.Domes 61 Mao directed China's general strategy, and Zhou was appointed general commander, coordinating Peng's forces with the Soviet and North Korean governments, and the rest of the Chinese government. Over the next week, Peng established a headquarters in Shenyang, and prepared his invasion strategy with his officers. After Zhou and Lin negotiated Stalin's approval, Peng attended a conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered the first wave of Chinese soldiers‚Äîin total more than 260,000 men‚Äîto cross into Korea on the night of October 19.Barnouin and Yu 147‚Äì148Zhang 94 On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign.Zhang 101‚Äì102 From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel.Roe 233 Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao's political objectives for the war.Zhang 123‚Äì124 About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign,Millett 381 but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 ‚Äì June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops,Millett 426 but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel.Domes 62 In the evaluation of US Army‚Äôs official Korean War historian Roy Edger Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills.Appleman 15 During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October‚ÄìDecember 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January‚ÄìMay 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the successes and failures of the war. PVA casualties during the first 12 months of the Korean War, from October 1950 to October 1951, were heavy. Soviet material support was slight; and, because the only available means to transport supplies into Korea for the first year of the war was a force of 700,000 labourers, all available supplies were light and limited. The UN forces also had complete air superiority. These logistic constraints later caused 45,000 Chinese soldiers to freeze to death between November 27 and December 12, 1950, due to inadequate winter clothing.Domes 135 China's insufficient artillery, armor, and air support meant that Peng was forced to rely heavily on human wave tactics until the summer of 1951: stealthy fireteams attacked in column against weak points in enemy defenses, hoping that surprise, attrition and perseverance would break the enemy lines.Roe 433‚Äì435 Participants even drank large quantities of Kaoliang wine in order to improve their courage. Some of the worst Chinese battle losses occurred during the Second and the Fifth Phase Campaign: up to 40 percent of all Chinese forces in Korea were rendered combat ineffective between November 25 and December 24, 1950,Roe 412 and about 12 Chinese divisions were lost in during April 22 ‚Äì June 10, 1951.Millett 446 All in all, over a million Chinese soldiers became casualties during the course of the war.Li 111 Peng justified the PVA's high casualty rate by his almost religious belief in the cause of Communism and the Communist Party, and his belief that the ends of the conflict justified the means. Some accounts even claimed that Peng invented the human wave tactic under the name \\"short attack\\" in order to exploit his manpower advantage.Roe 93 On November 19, 1951, Zhou called a conference in Shenyang to discuss improvements to China's logistical network, but these did little to directly resolve China's supply problems. Peng visited Beijing several times over the next several months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. By the winter of 1951‚Äì52, Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On February 24, 1952, the Central Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: \\"You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?\\" The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.Barnouin and Yu 148‚Äì149 Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three-anti Campaign due to his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA's hardship.Zhang 213 In 1953, Peng signed the armistice agreement which ended the Korean War. Truce talks began on July 10, 1951, but proceeded slowly.Barnouin and Yu 149 Peng was recalled back to China in April 1952 due to a head tumor, and Chen Geng and Deng Hua later assumed Peng's responsibilities in the PVA.Zhang 207, 304 On July 27, 1953, Peng personally signed the Armistice agreement in Panmunjom, ending the Korean War. At a mass rally in Pyongyang on July 31, Kim Il Sung awarded Peng his second North Korean \\"National Flag\\" Order of Merit, First Class (the first had been awarded to Peng in 1951), and awarded Peng the title of \\"Hero of the Korean Democratic People's Republic\\". Peng also received a hero's welcome in Tiananmen Square on August 11.Domes 63‚Äì64 Chinese troops remained in North Korea until 1958.Zhang 247 Peng's experiences in the Korean War strongly affected his outlook over the next decade. The heavy losses sustained during the first year of the war convinced him that the Chinese army needed to change by introducing modern equipment and standards of professionalism, and by developing new tactics more suited to modern conventional warfare. He came to believe strongly that military training should never be reduced in favour of political indoctrination, and that military commanders should enjoy seniority over commissars. Because the only communist country fully prepared for modern technical warfare was the Soviet Union, Peng grew to see the Soviet Red Army as a model for the development of China's PLA. These perspectives, and Peng's long-held conviction that the primary role of the Communist Party was to improve the welfare of the common people, were contrary to Mao's political goals, contributing to their eventual conflict in the late 1950s.Domes 47, 64‚Äì65 Stalin once arbitrated in favor of Peng in a conflict with a Russian diplomat, saying \\"Trust him in everything; Peng is a long-tested, talented militarist\\".  Defense Minister  After being recalled back to China in April 1952, Peng succeeded Zhou in managing the day-to-day affairs of the Central Military Commission in July 1952;Barnouin and Yu 151 and, in the spring of 1954, Peng was confirmed as the vice-chairman of the Commission (Mao was its chairman), becoming effectively the most senior military leader in China. On September 24, 1954, the First National People's Congress confirmed Peng's position, and appointed him Defense Minister and one of the ten vice- ministers of the State Council. Lin Biao was senior to Peng on the State Council. Soon after accepting these appointments, on October 1, 1954, Peng produced an ambitious plan for the modernization of the PLA on the model of the Soviet military.Domes 65 = Political activities = After returning to China from the Korean War, Peng became engaged in a rivalry with Mao Zedong over the political future of China (Photo: Hou Bo). Peng had been an alternate member of the Central Committee since 1934, a full member since 1938, and a member of the Politburo since 1945, but it was not until he became the leader of the PLA and moved permanently to Beijing, in November 1953, that Peng was able to attend regular political meetings and became active in domestic politics. Peng had been loyal to Mao's leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference, and continued to support Mao for several years after moving to Beijing.Domes 70‚Äì73 Peng (like Lin Biao) was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang's effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953, but then opposed Gao in 1954, once Mao made his own opposition clear. Mao did not take any action against Peng (or Lin), but Peng's involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu's supporters.Teiwes 86‚Äì87 In 1955 Peng supported Mao's efforts to collectivize agriculture. Along with Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Lin Boqu, and Luo Ronghuan, Peng opposed Mao's attempt to liberalize China's culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign, but then supported Mao's efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized the CCP later that year. During the late 1950s, Peng developed a personal dislike for Mao's efforts to promote his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955‚Äì56 Peng was involved in a large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that \\"the military victories of the PVA\\" were won \\"under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong\\": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase \\"and of Comrade Mao Zedong\\". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: \\"why take the trouble to put it up? What is put up now will be removed in the future.\\" When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted \\"Long Live Chairman Mao!\\" (literally \\"10,000 years for Chairman Mao\\"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: \\"You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' ‚Äì does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!\\" When one of Peng's political commissars suggested that the Maoist hymn The East is Red should be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, similarly saying \\"That is a personality cult! That is idealism!\\" Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: \\"He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?\\"Domes 70‚Äì74 In preparation for the Eighth National Congress, held in September 1956, Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the new Party Constitution. At this meeting, Peng suggested that a section in the Constitution's preamble referring to Mao Zedong Thought be removed. Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, and most other senior CCP members present quickly agreed, and it was removed from the final version of the 1956 Party Constitution. At the Congress, Peng was re-appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee. Peng resented Mao's personal lifestyle, which Peng considered decadent and luxurious. By the late 1950s Mao had developed a lifestyle that was out of touch with Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity. Mao enjoyed a private pool in Zhongnanhai, and had many villas around China built for him, which he would travel to on a private train. Mao enjoyed the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train.Spence 565 Mao had a costly office suite built for him in Beijing, including a private, book-lined study. When Peng's wife suggested the couple spend more free time visiting Mao's quarters, Peng was reluctant, stating that Mao's surroundings were \\"too luxuriously furnished\\" for him to tolerate. Throughout the 1950s, Peng continued to refer to the Chairman as \\"Old Mao\\", an egalitarian title that was used among senior CCP leaders in the 1930s and 1940s.Teiwes 84 = Military activities = Following the Korean War, Peng rose in prominence - here seen welcoming Kim Il-sung to Beijing in 1955 Peng staged his first offensive after becoming Defense Minister in January 1955, when he attacked and occupied a chain of islands, part of Zhejiang, which were still held by the Kuomintang, from which the Nationalists occasionally staged guerrilla raids as far as Shanghai. This operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan, effectively preventing the communists from completely defeating the Kuomintang.Domes 66 Peng participated in a number of foreign trips throughout the communist world after becoming Defense Minister, the first time that he had traveled outside of China and North Korea. In May 1955 Peng visited East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union, meeting with Wilhelm Pieck, J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz, Nikita Khrushchev, and the Soviet marshals Konstantin Rokossovsky and Georgy Zhukov. In September 1955 Peng traveled to Poland and the Soviet Union to attend the signing of the Warsaw Pact as an observer. In November 2 ‚Äì December 3, 1957 Peng accompanied Mao on his second visit to the Soviet Union. From April 24 ‚Äì June 13, 1959 Peng went on a \\"military goodwill tour\\" across the communist world, visiting Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia.Domes 67 After Peng returned from his first tour abroad, in September 1955, he began to seriously implement his \\"Four Great Systems\\": the implementation of standardized military ranks, salaries, awards, and rules of conscription. On September 23, 1955 the State Council named Peng one of the ten marshals of the PLA, China's highest military rank.Domes 67‚Äì68 (Before 1955, Chinese soldiers were assigned \\"functions\\" instead of ranks, such as \\"company commander\\", or \\"division commander\\").Casella PLA leaders were promoted into Peng's newly founded system of military ranks, and were awarded newly created orders of merit. Peng himself was awarded the First Class Medal of the Order of August 1 (for his achievements in the Chinese Civil war from 1927‚Äì1937), the First Class Medal of the Order of Independence and Freedom (for his achievements in the Sino-Japanese War), and the First Class Medal of the Order of Liberation (for his achievements in the Chinese Civil war from 1945‚Äì1949). Peng introduced military insignia for the first time, and issued military uniforms modeled on those worn by Soviet soldiers. From January 1, 1956 Peng replaced conscription with voluntary service, and standardized career soldiers' salaries on eighteen grades, from private second class to marshal. In May 1956 Peng introduced a clear prioritization of rank favoring commanders over political commissars. By September 1956 Peng's doctrines of professionalism, strict training, discipline, and the mastery of modern equipment were entrenched within the structure of the PLA. Mao Zedong opposed all of these initiatives, but first focused his dissatisfaction on other marshals, Liu Bocheng and Luo Ronghuan, who Mao accused of \\"dogmatism\\" (uncritically assimilating methods borrowed from the Soviet Union). In 1958 Mao convinced Peng of the need to maintain a balance between military professionalism and political indoctrination, and Peng cooperated in removing Liu and Luo from high positions. Peng's removal of Liu especially cost Peng the support of many other military leaders, and Mao used Liu's resulting criticism of Peng to criticize Peng before other senior Chinese leaders the next year, when Mao then sought to remove Peng.Teiwes 89 Peng was still in command of China's armed forces when Mao ordered the shelling of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands off the coast of Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng developed a strategy with his Chief of Staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, eventually leading to the islands' surrender. After the islands' surrender, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China, and began on August 28. The attack included a coordinated effort to cut off the islands' air and sea supply lines.Domes 69‚Äì70, 82 The campaign ran into unexpected difficulties, and did not achieve its objectives. The Soviet Union did not give explicit support to the operation, and the United States provided air and sea cover to Kuomintang supply ships up to within three miles of the Chinese coast. Kuomintang fighter jets shot down thirty-seven PRC fighters (while only losing three themselves), and Nationalist artillery and naval bombardments destroyed fourteen PRC ships. Peng had quietly opposed the operation since its beginning, and began to gradually end hostilities after the PLA encountered serious difficulties, announcing a series of intermittent ceasefires before eventually halting the campaign in late October. Su Yu was blamed for the disaster and replaced with another ally of Peng's, General Huang Kecheng. Peng's position was not directly affected, but his personal prestige suffered, and the practical effects of his efforts to modernize China's armed forces were called into question within the PLA. Su was accused of directing the aborted attack on Matzu and withdrawing troops from North Korea without authorization, and of secretly taking orders from the USSR. The conflict between Su and Peng lingered throughout Peng's life, and Su was not rehabilitated until after his death.Phoenix Online Comprehensive History 3  Fall from power  = The Great Leap Forward = During the Great Leap Forward, many farmers were forced to work in primitive backyard furnaces in order to produce poor-quality steel. In the autumn of 1957 Mao suggested a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became the basis of the Great Leap Forward,Domes 78 a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, tens of millions of people had starved to death.Yang Jisheng. Section I From October‚ÄìDecember 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.Domes 80‚Äì81 Peng did not oppose Mao's collectivizations in the first phase of the Great Leap, from late 1957‚Äì early 1958, but he increasingly opposed it from spring-winter 1958, as the problems which Mao's policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958 Peng gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the Great Leap Forward, Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.Domes 82 Peng made regular inspection tours of the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying \\"The Chairman talks all the time about more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What does he want with chanting these liturgies all the time?\\" On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: \\"unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm.\\" On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for \\"steel\\", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward:Domes 82‚Äì83, 86 : Grain scattered on the ground, potato leaves withered; : Strong young people have left to make steel; : Only children and old women reap the crops; : How can they pass the coming year? : Allow me to raise my voice for the people!Domes 83 At an enlarged Politburo meeting in Shanghai, held from March 25 ‚Äì April 1, Peng openly criticized Mao in the Chairman's presence for the first time, accusing him of \\"taking personal command\\" of national politics and disregarding the collective leadership of the Chinese government and the Party. Mao responded with vague criticisms of Peng, which Peng said was \\"provocative\\". From April 24 ‚Äì June 15 Peng left on a goodwill military tour through Eastern Europe. Peng met with Khrushchev on May 24, and was criticized during the Cultural Revolution for having criticized Mao's leadership to the Soviet leader, but the evidence that Peng criticized Mao to Khrushchev is very circumstantial, and Mao did not mention this during his efforts to have Peng purged. Peng's absence from China during the seven weeks that he was abroad allowed Mao to freely spread negative rumors discrediting Peng within the Party, and to develop consensus among other senior Party leaders to oppose Peng when he returned.Domes 87‚Äì88 = The Lushan Conference = The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth CCP Central Committee was held in the scenic resort town of Lushan, Jiangxi, on July 2, 1959, to discuss Party members' positions on the Great Leap Forward. Mao opened the conference by encouraging Party members to \\"criticize and offer opinions\\" on the government's \\"mistakes and shortcomings\\", and he promised that he would not attack any member personally as a \\"rightist\\" or \\"counter-revolutionary\\" for any opinions expressed at the conference. Peng had returned to China just previous to the conference after spending seven weeks abroad and was not planning on attending the conference, but Mao personally phoned Peng and invited him to attend. Peng obeyed Mao and travelled to Lushan to participate in the conference.Domes 88‚Äì89 Peng participated in group meetings in the early portion of the conference, gaining consensus among his peers for criticizing the widespread practice of inaccurately reporting agricultural statistics, and emphasizing that \\"everybody had a share of responsibility, including Comrade Mao Zedong\\". Peng bluntly criticized the hesitation of senior Party members to disagree with the Party leadership, implying that many Party leaders were cowardly for following orders that they knew were not in the best interests of the Chinese people. After gaining the consensus of several of his peers, Peng developed his opinions more systematically,Domes 89‚Äì91 but was hesitant to bring up the full range of his criticisms in public. Peng discussed his thoughts with several other senior Party leaders (notably the CCP Secretary of Hunan, Zhou Xiaozhou (Âë®Â∞èËàü), and Peng's colleagues encouraged Peng to visit Mao privately in order to win Mao's support for a reversal of the policies of the Great Leap Forward. Peng visited Mao's quarters on the night of July 13, but found Mao asleep, and wrote Mao a \\"letter of opinion\\" articulating Peng's ideas instead.Teiwes 90 Peng delivered the letter to Mao on the morning of July 14, but Mao did not read the letter until July 17. Later on July 17 Mao had Peng's letter widely circulated among the other delegates at the conference. Peng did not intend his letter to be widely read and attempted to prevent its circulation, but was not successful. Most other senior leaders, including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, supported Peng's position before Mao began to attack it, indicating that they shared Peng's views and that they did not see Peng's letter as an attack on the Chairman. In Peng's letter, Peng compared himself to the courageous but tactless Han dynasty general Zhang Fei. Because of Mao's appreciation of Zhang's enemy, Cao Cao, Mao interpreted this as implying a confrontational relationship. Peng criticized the poor allocation of labour across China, especially the inefficient, country-wide practice of forcing farmers to work in backyard furnaces. He criticized the nationwide famine and severe shortage of cotton, and stated that the Chinese people were justified in demanding change from the present conditions. Peng blamed the problems of the Great Leap on what he called \\"problems in our way of thinking and style of work\\", especially the tendency for Party administrators to submit exaggerated production reports, and for Party bureaucrats to accept these figures uncritically. Peng blamed the mistakes of the Party on a culture of \\"petty bourgeois fanaticism\\", a tendency to believe in achieving change through blindly encouraging mass movements, and claimed that the acceptance of this culture had led to the Party leadership forgetting \\"the mass-line and the style of seeking truth from facts\\", which Peng believed had led to the Communist victories over the Japanese and Kuomintang. Peng criticized Mao's policy of \\"putting politics in command\\", substituting economic principles and productive work for political objectives.Domes 91‚Äì93 Mao's decision to have Peng's letter widely circulated completely changed the direction of the conference. On July 21, Zhang Wentian gave an independent, supplementary speech attacking Mao's policies, and the same day a majority of delegates expressed their approval of Peng's letter, making it an official conference document. Mao interpreted the letter as a personal attack, and began to defend himself on July 23, attacking Peng and those who disagreed with his policies. Mao defended his commune system by claiming that \\"until now, not a single commune has collapsed\\". He attacked Peng and those who shared his political opinions as \\"imperialists\\" \\"bourgeoisie\\", and \\"rightists\\", and associated their positions with other Communist leaders who had led failed oppositions to Mao's leadership, including Li Lisan, Wang Ming, Gao Gang, and Rao Shushi. Mao brought up an ultimatum, stating that, if the delegates of the conference sided with Peng, Mao would split the Communist Party, retreating into the countryside and leading the peasants to \\"overthrow the government\\". The other senior leaders of the Communist Party, including Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi, were unwilling to risk splitting the Party, and sided with Mao in opposing Peng's position.Domes 94‚Äì95 From August 2, the conference debated whether Peng should be disciplined, what punishment Peng should receive, and for what reasons. On August 16 the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution condemned Peng as the leader of an \\"anti-Party clique\\", and called for Peng's removal from the positions of Defense Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission. The resolution did not eject Peng from the Communist Party, and it allowed Peng to retain his position in the Politburo, but he was excluded from Politburo meetings for years. The second resolution recognized Mao's dominance within the Party and subtly called for an end to the policies of the Great Leap Forward.Domes 98‚Äì100 After Mao had rallied the rest of the Party against him, Peng's options were limited to stubbornly standing his ground, engaging in a humiliating self-criticism, or suicide. After private discussion with other senior leaders, Peng considered the prestige of Mao and the unity of the Party and agreed to make a self-criticism,Teiwes 91 which was publicly reviewed at the conference, in which he admitted that he had made \\"severe mistakes\\" associated with his \\"rightist viewpoint\\", that he had been a follower of Li Lisan and Wang Ming, and in which he openly implicated his supporters in his \\"mistakes\\". After the conference, Peng said privately to Zhou Enlai regarding his self-criticism: \\"For the first time in my life, I have spoken out against my very heart!\\" Mao purged most of Peng's supporters from important offices following the conference, almost completely isolating Peng politically for the rest of his life. Peng later reflected that he was confused that Mao could have interpreted his private letter as a political attack, and wondered why, after thirty years of working together, Mao could not have discussed the matter privately with him, if Peng had indeed made the mistakes Mao claimed he did.  Later life  In September 1959 Mao replaced Peng as Defense Minister with Lin Biao, effectively ending Peng's military career. Peng was relocated to a suburb of Beijing, forfeiting his Marshal's uniform and military decorations. Lin reversed Peng's reforms,Domes 100‚Äì101 abolishing all signs and privileges of rank, purging officers considered sympathetic to the USSR, directing soldiers to work part-time as industrial and agricultural labourers, and indoctrinating the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought.Snow. \\"Biographical Notes\\". Lin's system of indoctrination made it clear that the Party was clearly in command of China's armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army's political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to see that his directives were followed.Lee 172 Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA.Qiu 80 Lin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by using the army to promote Mao's personality cult throughout China,Tanner 522 devising and running a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA. The most successful of Lin's efforts to promote Mao's personality cult was the \\"learn from Lei Feng\\" campaign, which Lin began in 1963.Ebrey 442 = Partial rehabilitation = After his forced retirement, Peng lived alone, under constant surveillance from the Central Guard Unit of the PLA, accompanied by a secretary and a bodyguard. His wife remained in Beijing; and, due to her work as the Party secretary of Beijing Normal University, was only able to visit infrequently. Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to complain to Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng spent most of his free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged: even though he could not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed to the members of the Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of. In 1960 Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.Domes 113‚Äì114 In 1960‚Äì1961, the effects of Mao's economic policies continued to produce widespread economic collapse, improving Peng's reputation among Party leaders who secretly believed that Mao's policies were a mistake, and who desired to reverse them. Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi led Party efforts to revive the Chinese economy, and cultivated Peng's friendship as part of a wider effort to gain widespread support for their activities. In November‚ÄìDecember 1961 Peng received permission to leave his residence for the first time since 1959 in order to conduct an inspection tour of Hunan. Peng found the conditions there even worse than in 1959; and, in a January 1962 conference of 7,000 Party leaders to determine Party economic policies, repeated most of the criticisms that he had made at Lushan. On June 16, 1962, Peng submitted a document, his \\"Letter of 80,000 Words\\", to Mao and the Politburo, in which he gave a full account of his life, admitted to several \\"mistakes\\", defended himself against most of the accusations made against him at the Lushan Conference, requested to be readmitted to decision-making government bodies, and sharply criticized the economic policies of the Great Leap Forward. In his letter Peng first wrote one of his most widely quoted sayings: \\"I want to be a Hai Rui!\\" The efforts of Liu and Deng to rehabilitate Peng further were not initially successful. Peng was not allowed to attend the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth CCP Central Committee, held in September 1962, and the efforts to reverse the verdict on Peng made at the Lushan Conference failed. From 1962‚Äì1965, Peng continued to live in relative obscurity, though he was no longer under house arrest.Domes 113‚Äì116 After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao appointed Marshal He Long to the head of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.Rice 185-186 In September 1965 Mao agreed to rehabilitate Peng by promoting him to a position managing the industrial development of Southwest China, a project known as the Third Front. Peng initially refused this position, so Mao called him personally, and convinced Peng to accept it by suggesting that the condemnation of Peng at the Lushan Conference may have been a mistake. Peng was then appointed \\"Deputy Commander of the Great Third Line of Construction in Southwest China\\" and \\"Third Secretary of the Control Commission of the CCP's Southwest Bureau\\". In practice, Peng's responsibilities were to oversee the industrial development of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet, with a focus on developing military industries and logistical networks. These positions were far below what Peng's position had been before 1959, but signaled his return to national politics. Peng worked energetically until August 1966, when the beginning of the Cultural Revolution had him recalled to Chengdu and the first Red Guards began patrolling the streets, violently attacking their perceived enemies. Peng's bodyguards warned him to avoid contact with the Red Guards, but Peng disregarded their advice, saying: \\"a CCP member does not have to be afraid of the masses.\\" Peng's disregard for personal danger and his confidence in the Chinese Communist Party made him one of the Cultural Revolution's first victims.Domes 116‚Äì117 = Persecution during the Cultural Revolution = Peng Dehuai (1966) was brought to Beijing in chains by Red Guards, where he would be tortured and publicly humiliated for years. Peng was one of the first public figures singled out for persecution in 1966 by the Cultural Revolution Group. The Party Secretariat attempted to shield Peng, but Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, took a personal interest in Peng's persecution and directed Red Guards in Sichuan to find Peng in Chengdu, arrest him, and deliver him to Beijing to be persecuted. Local Red Guards in Chengdu were not enthusiastic to follow these orders: they visited Peng's house on December 22, 1966 and attempted to intimidate Peng by informing him of the recent arrests of some of his friends and comrades, and of the imminent arrests of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Because of local Red Guards' lack of enthusiasm to carry out Jiang Qing's orders, a more radical Red Guard leader, Wang Dabin, arrived in Chengdu on December 24, and denounced his local comrades as \\"rightists\\" and \\"traitors\\" for delaying Peng's arrest. The Red Guards then abducted Peng in the early morning of December 25, put him in chains, and ransacked his house. Peng's bodyguards arrived to save Peng at around 4:00 AM, but were already too late.Domes 117‚Äì119 Prime Minister Zhou Enlai made an effort to save Peng by placing him under PLA surveillance. On December 25, Zhou's office ordered the Red Guards who had abducted Peng to accompany members of the PLA from Chengdu, to deliver Peng to Beijing by train (instead of by plane, because the airports in Sichuan had been taken over by Red Guards), and then to deliver Peng to the Beijing PLA garrison. After the party arrived in Beijing, Wang Dabin successfully directed Red Guards under his command to delay the PLA unit scheduled to take possession of Peng, and succeeded in keeping Peng from being saved.Domes 119‚Äì120 In January 1967 Peng was taken to his first \\"struggle session\\", in which he was paraded in chains before several thousand jeering Red Guards, wearing a large paper dunce cap and with a wooden board hung from his neck, on which his \\"crimes\\" were written. In the fall Peng was held at a PLA military prison outside of Beijing, and was allowed to receive extra clothing. In July Mao and Lin Biao, cooperating with Jiang Qing's faction, ordered the PLA to form an \\"investigation group\\" to determine Peng's \\"crimes\\", so that Peng could be more thoroughly humiliated in future struggle sessions. Peng's jailers attempted to force Peng to confess that he was a \\"great warlord\\", a \\"great ambitionist\\", and a \\"great conspirator\\" who had \\"crept into the Party and the Army\\". Peng refused to confess to these accusations or to \\"surrender to the masses\\", so his jailers strapped Peng to the floor of an unlit cell, and did not allow him to stand or sit up, drink water, rise to go to the toilet, or move in his sleep for several days. After Peng still refused to \\"confess\\", his jailers began routinely beating him, breaking several ribs, injuring his back, and damaging his internal organs,People's Daily Online especially his lungs. Peng's violent \\"interrogations\\" lasted over ten hours a day, but his interrogators were replaced every two hours in order to keep them from developing any sympathy for Peng (a practice pioneered by Stalinist secret police in the 1930s). Peng was \\"interrogated\\" in this way over 130 times. During interrogations he shouted denials to the Red Guards who beat him, and it is reputed that he pounded the table so hard that the cell walls shook. In late July 1967, following the failed Wuhan Uprising, Party leaders decided that Peng should be used as an example by publicly humiliating him by name at a national level. On July 31, an article appeared that was distributed nationally, and which directed the nation to take part in vilifying him. In this article, Peng was called a \\"capitalist\\", a \\"great ambitionist and great conspirator\\" who had \\"always opposed Chairman Mao\\", and who was \\"the representative of the greatest capitalist-roader [Liu Shaoqi] in the army\\". The article accused Peng of conspiring with foreign countries, allying with \\"imperialists, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries\\", and waging \\"a wild attack against the Party\\". The campaign of national vilification against Peng lasted several months, until late 1967. On August 16 another article stated that Peng \\"was never a Marxist\\", but that he had instead been a \\"capitalist great warlord\\" who had \\"crept into the Party and into the army... we have to struggle against him until he falls, until he breaks down, until he stinks.\\" CCP propagandists made an effort to discredit Peng's military career by portraying it as a long string of failures, except for those battles that were supposedly directed closely by Mao Zedong, and to convince the Chinese people that Peng was a subhuman villain who should be destroyed without compassion or mercy.Domes 120‚Äì121, 141 In August 1967, Peng was taken to a \\"struggle meeting\\", which was held in a stadium attended by 40,000 PLA soldiers. At this meeting, Peng was led in chains to a stage, where he was forced to kneel for several hours while he listened to soldiers repeatedly denouncing him for his \\"crimes\\". At the end of the meeting, Lin Biao personally appeared to the soldiers, where he addressed the assembled soldiers and Peng, who was still kneeling. Lin gave a speech in which he denounced Peng as a villainous element who must be purged, and that it was \\"in the interest of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole people of the whole country\\" to persecute Peng so severely. Lin then addressed Peng directly, stating: \\"If you reform yourself, all right, if not, it is all right too. But of course we hope you reform yourself.\\" It is not known whether Peng eventually broke down and \\"confessed\\" at the rally.Domes 121‚Äì122 Peng was imprisoned for the rest of his life. In 1969 the Party formed a \\"special investigation group\\" to reach a verdict in his case. Peng's jailers then forced Peng to write a full biography of his life many times, but they did not believe that he ever fully confessed his \\"crimes\\". Peng was then subjected to constant violent \\"interrogations\\" throughout most of 1970, until a special military tribune sentenced Peng to life imprisonment. The sentence was immediately approved by Lin Biao's General Chief of Staff, Huang Yongsheng.Domes 122 After the 1971 Lin Biao incident, the military attempted to improve Peng's living conditions, but the years of deprivation and torture from 1967‚Äì1970 had seriously weakened his physical health, and from late 1972 until his death Peng was seriously ill, probably with tuberculosis, thrombosis, or both. Peng was briefly hospitalized in 1973 before being returned to prison, the first time that he had been outside of prison since 1967. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited Peng in the hospital and convinced his jailers to allow an operation, but the nature and results of this operation are unknown. Peng's medical condition deteriorated further in 1974, but because of direct orders from Mao not to treat him, he received no substantial medical aid. Peng died at 3:35 PM on November 29, 1974.Domes 122‚Äì124 His last wish was to see the sun and trees outside the windows of his hospital room (the windows were covered with newspaper), but this request was denied.Chung 391 Peng Meikui was allowed to view Peng's body for twenty minutes, but was then removed. Peng's body was quickly cremated, and his ashes were sent to Chengdu, identified only by a note that read: \\"No. 327 ‚Äì Wang Chuan, from Chengdu.\\"  Posthumous rehabilitation  The leadership of the CCP successfully concealed Peng's death for several years, and successfully convinced the only civilian witness, Peng Meikui, not to tell anyone of Peng's death. Peng's former bodyguards did not learn of his death until 1976. Peng's wife, Pu Anxiu, had also been arrested by Red Guards and \\"sentenced\\" to a \\"labour reform camp\\", where she remained until 1975, when she was released to settle as a farmer in North China. She did not find out about Peng's death until she was allowed to return to Beijing in 1978, when the news was first publicly disclosed.Domes 124 Mao died in 1976. Following a brief power struggle, Peng's former ally, Deng Xiaoping, emerged as the paramount leader of China. One of Deng's first political goals was to rehabilitate Party members who had been condemned and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. By 1978, many people, led by General Huang Kecheng (who had been a comrade of Peng's since Peng rebelled against the Kuomintang in 1928) were agitating for Peng's posthumous rehabilitation. The Chinese government formally reversed the \\"erroneous\\" verdict of Peng during the Third Plenum of the Eleventh CCP Central Committee, held from December 18‚Äì22, 1978. Deng gave a speech announcing Peng's rehabilitation,Domes 124‚Äì127 stating: > He was courageous in battle, open and straightforward, incorruptible and > impeccable, and strict towards himself. He cared about the masses, and was > never concerned about his own advantage. He was never afraid of > difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he > was dilligent, honest, and he had an utmost sense of responsibility.Domes > 127‚Äì128 Deng's speech also stated that Mao's decision in 1959, which vilified Peng as the leader of an \\"anti-Party clique\\", had been \\"entirely wrong\\", and that it had \\"undermined intra-Party democracy\\". From January 1979, the Party encouraged historians and those who had known Peng to produce many memoirs, historical stories, and articles praising and remembering Peng. In 1980 the Intermediate Court of Justice in Wuhan sentenced Wang Dabin, the Red Guard who had directed Peng's arrest in 1966, to nine years in prison for \\"the persecution and torture of Comrade Peng Dehuai\\".Domes 128 In 1986, an \\"autobiography\\", Memoirs of a Chinese Marshal, was compiled from various documents that Peng had written about his life. Much of the material for Memoirs was drawn from the \\"confessions\\" that Peng had written during the Cultural Revolution, and the book focused on Peng's early life, before the Second Sino-Japanese War.Teiwes 81 In 1988, China released a set of stamps to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Peng's birth.China Stamps Here In modern China, Peng is considered one of the greatest military leaders of the twentieth century.Domes 143‚Äì144  See also  * Chinese Red Army and People's Liberation Army - Chinese Civil War * Eighth Route Army - Second Sino-Japanese War * People's Volunteer Army - Korean War * List of generals of the People's Republic of China * Lushan Conference - History of the People's Republic of China (1949‚Äì1976)  References  = Citations = = Sources = Appleman, Roy.

Gohan is introduced as the first son of the protagonist Goku, and his wife Chi-Chi, in chapter #196 , first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on October 8, 1988. Chi-Chi is a strict and protective mother to Gohan, forcing him to focus on his studies and forbidding him from practicing martial arts. However, due to the various threats to the Earth, she reluctantly allows him to fight, with him ultimately becoming one of the strongest characters in the series. Gohan has been well received by both fans and critics, the latter usually citing the character's growth from his initial appearance to his defeat of Cell. Son Gohan is the first character in Dragon ball who achieved the form of Super Saiyan at a young age as a Half-Saiyan.  Creation and design  Gohan's name comes from the Japanese word , a continuation of the naming scheme of foods by Toriyama. Rice, being a grain, is not normally considered to be a vegetable, even though it is a common food. However, as the word \\"vegetable\\" is a culinary term, and not a botanical term, the name can also continue the naming scheme for Saiyan characters, which derives names from puns on vegetables.Online English to Japanese Dictionary In conceptualizing for Gohan's character, Toriyama originally included glasses or a jacket to his apparel, and commonly, his hair is spiked up as seen in the final design.Dragon Ball Daizensh≈´, book 4, Dragon Ball World Guide With the ending of the Cell arc, Gohan was meant to replace his father as the protagonist. However, Toriyama later decided against it, finding the character unsuited for the role in comparison to his father. As opposed to full-blooded Saiyans, whose hair stays the same from birth,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 16, chapter 181 Gohan's is drawn at varying lengths, and changes markedly in style. Initially, Gohan is illustrated garbed in a surcoat with kanji Â≠´ (grandchild), fixed on the front and the four-star Dragon Ball fitted on top of his hat. Piccolo later supplies him with a keikogi fashioned after Goku's, but substitutes the symbol with his own demon character \\"\\".Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 13 Normally thereafter, Gohan is drawn with a keikogi modeled after Piccolo's own. On Namek, Gohan is portrayed in battle armor worn by Frieza's henchmen, having been given it by Vegeta in preparation for their encounter with Frieza. Prior to his second fight with Majin Buu, Gohan asks Kibito for an outfit resembling his father's, and is then drawn in a keikogi identical to Goku's. Gohan, from the alternate future, is dressed in a keikogi similar to that of his father's with his kanji name È£Ø (Gohan), and has a long scar across his left eye. = Abilities = Gohan possesses superhuman strength and durability,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 23, chapter 277 as well as superhuman speed and reflexes, as seen during his training with his younger brother Goten. As a child, Gohan is depicted with an immense amount of hidden potential, which at first only revealed itself when he experienced fierce rage or distress.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 9Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 12 The vastness of this potential is shown consistently throughout the series as he ages and learns to master his powers from constant training and battles, the earliest example was during his short fight with Raditz. Gohan's potential was unlocked twice in the series: first by the Namekian Grand Elder,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 7, chapter 77 and then fully unlocked by Old Kai≈ç-shin,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 294 which sees his power level rise to new heights, capable of easily overwhelming the seemingly invincible Majin Buu.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 303 As a Half-Saiyan, he has the ability to become an Oozaru, a gigantic ape-like creature, by absorbing waves from a full moon. He lost this ability after his tail was cut by Piccolo,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 14 and later Vegeta.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 4, chapter 46 He was the third youngest Saiyan to achieve the Super Saiyan transformation at the age of nine whilst training and surpassing his father Goku in the Room of Spirit and Time (hyperbolic time chamber)Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 16, chapter 188 and as a display of his hidden potential which he unlocked during his training with his father, Gohan becomes the first Saiyan in the series to become a Super Saiyan 2 during his battle against Cell. Though Gohan had gotten much weaker due to not training after the Cell Games, he became stronger than he ever has after his potential was unlocked from Old Kai≈ç-shin. Gohan with this power up was even stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Goku and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks since he was able to dominate Super Buu with ease without transforming. Ever since this fight, Gohan has given up on fighting and has continually gotten weaker to the point that he can't use his Super Saiyan transformations without straining himself. Gohan can still hold his own against Frieza's soldiers, Shisami, and Tagoma in his base form and overpower them when he transforms into a Super Saiyan. After Frieza's attack on Earth, Gohan returned to training with Piccolo. During his training with Piccolo before the start of the Tournament of Power, Gohan is pushed beyond his limits and manages to unlock his hidden power once again, becoming stronger than ever before. Gohan has the ability to freely manipulate a life-force energy known as ki to fly using ,.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 6, chapters 61-62 He can also concentrate his ki to fire blasts of energy, such as the or the .Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 20, chapter 233 Gohan has displayed the use of his ki in a defensive manner, such as generating protective energy shields. Both as a child and an adult, Gohan is known to be a capable swordsman, as well as an adept teacher. = Voice actors = Gohan is voiced in the original Japanese anime and all other media by Masako Nozawa. Nozawa, who also voices Goku, revealed that she did not know she would be playing Gohan until receiving the script on the day of recording his debut episode. Despite having to voice Gohan, Goku, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image. In Funimation and Saban Entertainment's initial 1996 English dub of Dragon Ball Z, Gohan is voiced by Saffron Henderson. Henderson reprised her role in AB Group and Westwood Media's alternate dub for the UK and Canadian markets in 2000. Jillian Michaels replaced Henderson in the later part of the Cell arc, while his adult version is voiced by Brad Swaile. Henderson believed her experience playing Goku in Dragon Ball made it simple to develop Gohan's voice, though stressed performing as him was \\"tiring\\" due to the action of the series requiring louder volumes. She also remembered scheduling conflicts thanks to her wedding, setting the stage for the studio to audition other voice actors for the part of Gohan, and being disappointed at the role being recast. In Funimation's in-house dub, Gohan's child incarnation is voiced by Stephanie Nadolny for various media until 2010 and Colleen Clinkenbeard for Dragon Ball Kai and later media while his adult incarnation is voiced by Kyle Hebert for almost all various media and Dameon Clarke as \\"Future Gohan\\" for some episodes and the History of Trunks TV special. Nadolny was called in to audition in 1999, when the English dub of Dragon Ball Z was recast. She said her most challenging time voicing the character was during his fight against Cell where she had to make him sound as \\"deep, tough and as much like a man as possible.\\" Nadolny's voice was strained during the recordings, causing her to sometimes leave the studio in pain. Hebert said that his roles as Gohan and the narrator of Dragon Ball Z are close to him as they kickstarted his career. He also found Battle of Gods to be \\"genuinely touching\\" outside of its fighting, citing Gohan finding out that he was going to be a father among the moments he found sentimental and was happy to return to the franchise when reprising his role in Resurrection 'F', also expressing interest in redoing his lines in Dragon Ball Kai as he had more experience. In the English dub of the video game Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout, Gohan is voiced by Lex Lang. In the English dub of Dragon Ball GT produced by Blue Water Studios distributed in Canada, he was voiced by Scott Roberts. In the English dub of movies distributed in Europe by AB Groupe, Gohan was voiced by Jodi Forrest, with David Gasman voicing Gohan as an adult in The History of Trunks. In the Toonami Asia dub produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment of Dragon Ball Super, Gohan here is voiced by Chris Hackney. In a rare English dub of the anime produced in the Philippines by Creative Products Corporation, Gohan was voiced by Ethel Lizano who also directed that dub. In the 1996 dub of the double feature combining Cooler's Revenge and The Return of Cooler also by Creative Products Corp.; young Gohan was voiced by E.J. Galang, who was 12 years old at the time he voiced Gohan.  Appearances  = In Dragon Ball = Gohan is introduced as the four-year-old son of the series protagonist Goku, named after his adoptive great-grandfather. Described as well-mannered and reserved,Dragon Ball Daizensh≈´, book 2, Story Guide Gohan's story begins following his abduction by the extraterrestrial Saiyan named Raditz, who is also his uncle. While Goku is pinned to the ground, Gohan's extreme distress explodes with the release of his dormant power, which allows him to injure Raditz. Piccolo then takes Gohan away following the fight and Goku's death, and trains him for the upcoming battle against the two other Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa, though Piccolo is aware that training the son of his greatest enemy will be a risk.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 11 His tutelage under Piccolo forms a deep bond between the two characters, with Piccolo ultimately sacrificing himself to save Gohan during their fight with Nappa.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 3, chapter 29 After Vegeta's defeat, Gohan travels with Bulma and Krillin to planet Namek to use the Dragon Balls there to revive their fallen friends, as the Dragon Balls on Earth had turned to stone due to the Earth's god Kami's death. After succeeding in gathering the Dragon Balls, Gohan and the others wish Piccolo back to life, causing Kami and the Dragon Balls to be returned. Gohan, along with Krillin and Vegeta, are then forced into an encounter with Frieza, who seeks the Dragon Balls for immortality. Shortly after the fight with Freeza begins, Krillin is impaled by one of Freeza's horns. Freeza stops Gohan as he tries to save Krillin, who has now been thrown into the ocean below, and he mocks him, saying it is pointless to try to save his friend since he and Vegeta are both about to die. Gohan is extremely angered by being unable to save Krillin and attacks Freeza without hesitation. He manages to knock Freeza into a small island below, and then he blasts him with a series of energy blasts before ending the attack with a Masenko.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 103 Later on in the fight, as Piccolo was getting repeatedly blasted from Freeza, who is now in his third form, Gohan blasts Freeza with another Masenko, and once again pushes him back with it. Freeza is able to send it back at Gohan without taking any damage, but he is once again shocked that a child could produce such an attack. Shortly after this, Freeza transforms into his original and most powerful form. Once he does this he immediately kills Dende, a young Namekian who had been secretly healing Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo and Vegeta. Gohan is outraged by this and unleashes all of his power against Freeza. However, he is unable to land even a single blow. After Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan enraged by the death of Krillin and defeats Freeza, the planet Namek explodes and Goku escapes while Freeza is left with serious injuries, Freeza is found in space by his father (King Cold) and is turned into a cyborg. Gohan is shown to settle back into school life on Earth, waiting for Goku to return home from Namek. After Trunks kills Freeza and his father King Cold then tells Goku about the Androids,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter 138 Gohan goes into the wilderness with Goku and Piccolo to train for the upcoming threat.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 12, chapter 142 After Vegeta kills Android #19,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 13, chapter 150 Dr. Gero (Android #20) activate Androids #17 and #18,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 13, chapter 155 and Cell is discovered,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 14, chapter 167 Gohan enters the Room of Spirit and Time with Goku where they train for 1 year (1 day on earth, however in their case according to Mr. Popo, Goku and Gohan still had 3 hours left in the room, but they came out having finished their training earlier than expected). Gohan makes the jump to Super Saiyan while he is in the chamber and after they emerge, both Goku and Gohan retain the physical characteristics of a Super Saiyan without any of the drawbacks of its form (increased aggression, energy loss, etc.). After Goku initially fights Cell but realizes later that he cannot defeat him, Gohan is called to fight to the surprise of everyone else and Cell. During the fight, Gohan asks Cell to stop the Cell Games tournament and then he tells him about his power. Cell, instead of heeding Gohan's warning, attacks him in an effort to force Gohan to show his true power. Gohan holds his own for a while until Cell becomes impatient and bored.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 212 He releases Cell Juniors on the other fighters to provoke Gohan from attacking. After Android #16 is murdered by Cell, Gohan unleashes his rage and transforms into a Super Saiyan 2.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 213 Gohan easily defeats the Cell Juniors and proceeds to toy with Cell, now that he has a much greater power level. This backfires, however; he waits too long to finish Cell, who decides to self-destruct when transformed back to his semi-perfect form, as a last-ditch effort to destroy Gohan and the Earth. Goku, in an act of self-sacrifice, uses teleportation to take Cell to Kaio- sama's planet. Thinking Cell dead, the fighters lower their guard only to be surprised by a blast that kills Trunks. Cell returns, having regenerated from a single Cell that survived the blast, and also adopted the instant transmission technique. Right before Cell is about to finish Vegeta, Gohan intercedes which costs him the use of his left arm.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 220 As Cell charges up one final Kamehameha wave to finish the Earth, Gohan hears the voice of his father who gives him the resolve he needs to defeat Cell. They both launch large Kamehameha waves at each other, which initiates a power struggle.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 221 Cell is about to overcome Gohan when Vegeta uses his remaining energy to blast Cell, which distracts him for a moment. Gohan uses this moment to unleash all his fury into his attack, which causes it to overpower Cell's. It hits Cell full- force which disintegrates all his cells, finally killing him.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 222 The Gohan of the alternate timeline, referred to as \\"Future Gohan\\", to distinguish him from the character's present-timeline incarnation, is presented in the volume #33 sidestory of the original manga, Trunks the Story, in which he is shown to be the only surviving fighter; the others have all died at the hands of the androids (sans Goku due to having died from a heart virus prior to androids' arrival).Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 17, chapter 140Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 17, chapter 141 Gohan is shown training Trunks to assist him in battling Androids #17 and #18. In this timeline, Gohan has become a Super Saiyan and is depicted wearing a uniform similar to his father's, one with his own kanji symbol on the back, Han, . Gohan states he wears it in hopes of becoming as strong as his father one day, and is mentioned that he bears a striking resemblance to Goku when donning it.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 17, Trunks the Story He eventually loses his left arm fighting Androids #17 and #18. He is ultimately killed by the two androids during a battle where they ganged up on Gohan, killing him with machine gun-like ki blasts. In the present-timeline, Gohan is shown enrolled at Orange Star High School in Satan City. After foiling crimes as a Super Saiyan he earns the alias the from the public. In order to hide his identity, and with help from Bulma, he adopts a superhero persona that he dubs the . When his peer, Videl figures out his identity as the Great Saiyaman, she blackmails him into attending the 25th Tenkaichi Bud≈çkai and teaching her to fly.Dragon Ball manga, volume 36, chapter 425 Over time, the two begin to bond together and eventually form a relationship. Gohan is depicted as having grown weaker, which the Daizensh≈´ World Guide book explains as due to a lack of training and anger in transforming. Gohan, after having his chi absorbed by Spopovich and Yamu, pursues the two and enters Bobbidi's spaceship with the Kai≈ç-shin, Goku and Vegeta, where Gohan later fights with Dabura.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 22, chapter 257 Following Majin Buu‚Äòs release and Gohan's defeat at his hands, Gohan is taken to the home planet of the Kai≈ç-shin. After pulling out the Zeta Sword (Known in the English Funimation Dub as the Z Sword) and accidentally breaking it in a training session, Gohan unwittingly releases the Old Kai≈ç-shin, who then performs a prolonged ceremony to unlock Gohan's latent powers. Gohan then returns to Earth and confronts Buu for a second time, and easily defeats him.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 302 However, his victory is temporary, as he is overpowered when Buu absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo. He is later absorbed by Buu.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 25, chapter 307 Though Goku and Vegeta manage to rescue him along with Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo, he is killed when Buu (now in his pure form) destroys the Earth. Once revived, Gohan is able to aid Goku's Genki-dama by lending his chi.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 26, chapter 319 Following Buu's defeat and a ten-year gap, Gohan has finally become a scholar, is married with Videl and they have a daughter Pan.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 26, chapter 324 = In Toriyama's films and Dragon Ball Super= Gohan appears in fourteen of the fifteen Dragon Ball Z films; in the first movie, Gohan is kidnapped by Garlic Jr. due to his hat having a Dragon Ball on it and causes the villain's plan to fail when he uses his dormant power against him;Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone in the second, Gohan participates in the fight against Dr. Wheelo and frees Piccolo from further mind control;Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest in the third, Gohan unintentionally brings Turles to Earth and is forcibly made to combat his father as an Oozaru before having his tail removed;Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might in the fourth, Gohan attempts to fight Lord Slug's men only to be defeated;Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug in the fifth, Gohan watches over his father's body after Goku shields him from a blast from Cooler;Dragon Z: Cooler's Revenge in the sixth, Gohan travels to New Namek and fights Cooler's henchmen;Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler in the seventh, Gohan intervenes in the battle against Android 13 by attacking him and then defending his father against the android when he tries to power the Genki-Dama;Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13 in the eighth, Gohan tries fighting Broly but is defeated and later aids in the Saiyan's defeat by providing his energy;Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan in the ninth, Gohan faces Bojack and his henchmen, struggling initially before transforming into a Super Saiyan 2 and successfully terminating the invaders;Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound in the tenth, Gohan comes to the aid of Goten and Trunks after they are confronted by Broly, who he seemingly kills alongside his father and brother in a family Kamehameha wave;Dragon Ball Z: Broly - Second Coming in the twelfth, Gohan combats the villains that have escaped from Other World;Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn in the thirteenth, Gohan battles Hirudegarn following his appearance;Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon in the fourteenth, Gohan is defeated by Beerus and provides his aid in transforming his father into a Super Saiyan God;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and lastly, in the fifteenth, Gohan confronts the resurrected Freeza and avoids being killed with the majority of the Earth's population thanks to a save by Whis.Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F After the latter two films' events, Gohan decides to resume his training with Piccolo.\\"Earth Explodes?!

Gohan has also appeared in crossover games such as Battle Stadium D.O.N, Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars as a playable character.  Reception  In 1993, Gohan placed first in a Dragon Ball character popularity poll voted on by Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump readers, and was also voted the third most popular character by fans of the series for the 2004 book Dragon Ball Forever. Due to the popularity of Gohan, other merchandise, such as action figures, video games, and clothing have featured Gohan in Japan and in various countries around the world. In an interview featured in the second Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files, a companion book released in December 1997 by Shueisha's Jump Comics Selection imprint, Masako Nozawa, Gohan's voice actress, stated that her favorite episode voicing Gohan was \\"Sorry, Robot-san - The Desert of Vanishing Tears\\". Saffron Henderson, Gohan's original English voice actor, has stated she felt protective of the role and considers it to be one of her favorites. In addition, Gohan's original Funimation voice actor, Stephanie Nadolny has said that playing Gohan was a unique and much-loved experience. C.J. A. Glover of Moviepilot ranked Gohan his third favorite comic character, admitting Gohan \\"has always been somewhat of an idol to me\\" as he related to bottling up his anger and being a gentle person that, when snapping, \\"would let loose and it would be hard to bottle it back up again.\\" In conclusion, Glover wrote that Gohan was definitely \\"one of my favorite anime and manga characters ever.\\" Gohan's relationship with mentor Piccolo during the Saiyan arc was praised, being seen as \\"complex\\" and \\"culminating in a truly emotional and inspiring moment that one doesn't often expect from your average animated series.\\" Tomoko Hiroki from Bandai Namco considered Gohan her favorite character from the series. Most of Gohan's praise is derived from his role in the Cell arc of Dragon Ball Z. IGN writer D. F. Smith liked how during the Cell Games, Gohan has more screentime than Goku, and praised his scenes as one of the biggest moments from said story arc. Theron Martin from Anime News Network celebrated Gohan's development in the Cell Games as he had grown up and become stronger. The character's battles against Cell during the arc and his transformation into a Super Saiyan 2 were positively received as some of the best in the entire series, the fight additionally being praised for its animation. Both Anime Focus and John Begley believed Dragon Ball Z could have ended with Gohan's defeat of Cell, the latter reasoning concluding it there would have \\"provided it a sense of poignancy and closure that retroactively would have provided a greater sense of depth and purpose.\\" Luke Ryan Baldock of The Hollywood News felt Gohan's progression was the focus of the Cell Games and that he had begun to match his father Goku in ability, calling their relationship \\"a fascinating one to watch unfold.\\" Reviewer Nick Hartel expressed that the \\"continuing elevation of Gohan\\" pleased him and the last episodes of the Cell storyline \\"properly sees this is paid off from a narrative standpoint.\\" Reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. wrote that the series split its focus between Goku and Gohan during the start of the series as they grew on their own, finding it to be \\"an interesting way to handle the flow of story but also important because it shows Gohan's growth as a person and warrior.\\" Gohan's role and character in the latter part of the series was met with more mixed reviews. Reviewer Michael Zupan wrote of his disappointment with the character, \\"Gohan was once the most promising warrior in the galaxy, with the potential to even best his father, Goku‚Ä¶ and this is where he's at seven years later? Dressing up in a green dress, black tights and a Lost in Space helmet to put the beat down on robbers?\\" Anime Focus found humor in his Great Saiyaman guise and his \\"clumsy but earnest\\" relationship with Videl, but thought it \\"mostly uninspired and draggy and feels very flat after the high flying antics of previous arcs.\\" Reviewer Brad Stephenson argued that the character growing older and becoming more \\"emotionally complex\\" provided Dragon Ball Z \\"with a true sense of progression and meaning.\\" While controversial, lighthearted and more casual fans of the show tend to enjoy the Saiyaman saga due to its comedic tone and way of portraying larger than life figures in relatable real life situations. Josh Begley enjoyed Gohan trying to find his place in high school and his role as big brother to Goten, but thought his Great Saiyaman guise was not comedic and became embarrassed on the character's behalf. Anime Focus was impressed with his fight against Majin Buu after he was powered up, calling it a \\"rare chance for him to flex his muscles\\" by giving Majin Buu \\"an impressive beatdown\\". Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that fans of the series tend to joke Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that Dragon Ball Super emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again. On the other hand, Leach criticized how Super tries to teach \\"life lessons\\" to a mature Gohan. The fact that Piccolo calls him \\"arrogant\\", despite Gohan's kindness and humility, was seen as a bad plot point by the reviewer. Mark Sammut of TheGamer notes that Gohan occasionally performs the dab move (as The Great Saiyaman), decades before it became a popular dance move in American popular culture.

It also houses the nonprofit City Lights Foundation, which publishes selected titles related to San Francisco culture. It was founded in 1953 by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Peter D. Martin (who left two years later). Both the store and the publishers became widely known following the obscenity trial of Ferlinghetti for publishing Allen Ginsberg's influential collection Howl and Other Poems (City Lights, 1956). Nancy Peters started working there in 1971 and retired as executive director in 2007. In 2001, City Lights was made an official historic landmark. City Lights is located at 261 Columbus Avenue. While formally located in Chinatown, it self- identifies as part of immediately adjacent North Beach. City Lights Bookstore - outside, 2013 History =Founding and early years= City Lights was the inspiration of Peter D. Martin, who relocated from New York City to San Francisco in the 1940s to teach sociology. He first used City Lights‚Äîin homage to the Chaplin film‚Äîin 1952 as the title of a magazine, publishing early work by such key Bay Area writers as Philip Lamantia, Pauline Kael, Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, and Ferlinghetti himself, as \\"Lawrence Ferling\\". A year later, Martin used the name to establish the first all-paperback bookstore in the U.S., at the time an audacious idea. Lawrence Ferlinghetti at City Lights in 2007 The site was a tiny storefront in the triangular Artigues Building located at 261 Columbus Avenue, near the intersection of Broadway in North Beach. Built on the ruins of a previous building destroyed in the fire following the 1906 earthquake, the building was designed by Oliver Everett in 1907 and named for its owners. City Lights originally shared the building with a number of other shops. It gradually gained more space whenever one of the other shops became vacant, and eventually occupied the entire building. In 1953, as Ferlinghetti was walking past the Artigues Building, he encountered Martin out front hanging up a sign that announced a \\"Pocket Book Shop.\\" He introduced himself as a contributor to Martin's magazine City Lights, and told him he had always wanted a bookstore. Before long he and Martin agreed to a partnership. Each man invested $500. Soon after they opened they hired Shig Murao as a clerk. Murao worked without pay for the first few weeks, but eventually became manager of the store and was a key element in creating the unique feel of City Lights.Shawn Hubler, \\"City Lights Illuminates the Past\\", Los Angeles Times, May 27, 2003. In 1955, Martin sold his share of the business to Ferlinghetti for $1000, moved to New York and started the New Yorker Bookstore which specialized in cinema. In the late 1960s, Ferlinghetti hired Joseph Wolberg, former philosophy professor at SUNY Buffalo, to manage the bookstore. Wolberg is credited with organizing the once chaotically messy shelves and for convincing a cheap Ferlinghetti to install anti-shoplifting metal detectors. Through his connection to City Lights, Wolberg produced records for Beat poets such as Charles Bukowski and Shel Silverstein. =1970s and 1980s= In 1971, Ferlinghetti persuaded Nancy Peters ‚Äì who was working at the Library of Congress ‚Äì to join in a project with him, after which she began full-time work at City Lights.Morgan, Bill, \\"City Lights bookshop tour\\", City Lights.

The building itself, with its clerestory windows and small mezzanine balcony, also qualified as a city landmark because of its \\"distinctive characteristics typical of small commercial buildings constructed following the 1906 earthquake and fire.\\" The landmark designation mandates the preservation of certain external features of the building and its immediate surroundings.

It offers three floors of new-release hardcovers and paperbacks from all major publishers, as well as a large selection of titles from smaller, independent publishers. City Lights is a member of the American Booksellers Association. Publishing In 1955, Ferlinghetti launched City Lights Publishers with his own Pictures of the Gone World, the first number in the Pocket Poets Series. This was followed in quick succession by Thirty Spanish Poems of Love and Exile translated by Kenneth Rexroth and Poems of Humor & Protest by Kenneth Patchen, but it was the impact of the fourth volume, Howl and Other Poems (1956) by Allen Ginsberg that brought national attention to the author and publisher. City Lights Journal published poems of the Indian Hungry generation writers when the group faced police case in Kolkata. The group got worldwide publicity thereafter. Apart from Ginsberg's seven collections, a number of the early Pocket Poets volumes brought out by Ferlinghetti have attained the status of classics, including True Minds by Marie Ponsot (1957), Here and Now by Denise Levertov (1958), Gasoline (1958) by Gregory Corso, Selected Poems by Robert Duncan (1959), Lunch Poems (1964) by Frank O'Hara, Selected Poems (1967) by Philip Lamantia, Poems to Fernando (1968) by Janine Pommy Vega, Golden Sardine (1969) by Bob Kaufman, and Revolutionary Letters (1971) by Diane di Prima. In 1967 the publishing operation moved to 1562 Grant Avenue. Dick McBride ran this part of the business with his brother Bob McBride and Martin Broadley for several years.Ferlinghetti, L & Morgan, B \\"The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour\\" City Lights Books, 2003 In 1971, Nancy Peters joined Ferlinghetti as co-editor and publisher.

Over the years, the press has published a wide range of poetry and prose, fiction and nonfiction, and works in translation. In addition to books by Beat Generation authors, the press publishes literary work by such authors as Charles Bukowski, Georges Bataille, Rikki Ducornet, Paul Bowles, Sam Shepard, Andrei Voznesensky, Nathaniel Mackey, Alejandro Murgu√≠a, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Ernesto Cardenal, Daisy Zamora, Guillermo G√≥mez-Pe√±a, Juan Goytisolo, Anne Waldman, Andr√© Breton, Kamau Da√°ood, Masha Tupitsyn, and Rebecca Brown. In 1965, the press published an anthology of texts by Antonin Artaud, edited by Jack Hirschman.Artaud, Antonin. Antonin Artaud Anthology, edited by Jack Hirschman. San Francisco: City Lights, 1965. Associated from the outset with radical left-wing politics and issues of social justice, City Lights has in recent years augmented its list of political non-fiction, publishing books by Noam Chomsky, Michael Parenti, Howard Zinn, Cindy Sheehan, and Ward Churchill. Howl Howl and Other Poems was published in the fall of 1956 as number four in the Pocket Poets Series from City Lights Books Ferlinghetti had heard Ginsberg read Howl in 1955 at the Six Gallery; the next day, he offered to publish it along with other shorter poems. William Carlos Williams ‚Äî who was Ginsberg's childhood Pediatrician and himself a future Pocket Poet with a 1957 edition of his early modernist classic, Kora in Hell (1920) ‚Äî was recruited for an introduction, perhaps to lend literary justification to Howl's depictions of drug use and homosexuality. Prior to publication, Ferlinghetti had asked, and received, assurance from the American Civil Liberties Union that the organization would defend him, should he be prosecuted for obscenity. Published in November 1956, Howl was not long in generating controversy. In March 1957, local Collector of Customs Chester MacPhee seized a shipment from England of the book's second printing on grounds of obscenity, but he was compelled to release the books when federal authorities refused to confirm his charge. But the troubles were just beginning, for in June of that year, local police raided City Lights Bookstore and arrested store manager Shigeyoshi Murao on the charge of offering an obscene book for sale. Ferlinghetti, then in Big Sur, turned himself in on his return to San Francisco. Both faced a possible $500 fine and a 6-month sentence. (Ginsberg was in Tangiers at the time, and not charged.) The ACLU posted bail, assigned defense counsel Albert Bendich to the case, and secured the pro bono services of famous criminal defense lawyer J. W. Ehrlich. The municipal court trial, presided over by Judge Clayton W. Horn, ran from August 16 to September 3, 1957. The charges against Murao were dismissed since it couldn't be proved that he knew what was in the book. Then, during the trial of Ferlinghetti, respected writers and professors testified for the defense. Judge Horn rendered his precedent- setting verdict, declaring that Howl was not obscene and that a book with \\"the slightest redeeming social importance\\" guarantees First Amendment protection. Horn's decision established the precedent that paved the way for the publication of such hitherto banned books as D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer. The media attention resulting from the trial stimulated national interest, and, by 1958, there were 20,000 copies in print. Today there are over a million. Ginsberg continued to publish his major books of poetry with the press for the next 25 years. Even after the publication by Harper & Row of his Collected Poems in 1980, he would continue his warm association with City Lights, which served as his local base of operations, for the rest of his life.

Recording prolifically for Blue Note Records as both leader and sideman, Green performed in the hard bop, soul jazz, bebop, and Latin-tinged idioms throughout his career. Critics Michael Erlewine and Ron Wynn write, \\"A severely underrated player during his lifetime, Grant Green is one of the great unsung heroes of jazz guitar ...

He often performed in an organ trio, a small group with an organ and drummer. Apart from guitarist Charlie Christian, Green's primary influences were saxophonists, particularly Charlie Parker, and his approach was therefore almost exclusively linear rather than chordal. He thus rarely played rhythm guitar except as a sideman on albums led by other musicians.\\"To hear [Grant] comp [i.e., play rhythm guitar] behind a soloist you have to check his sideman dates...\\" Sharony Andrews Green (1999), Grant Green: Rediscovering the Forgotten Genius of Jazz Guitar, Backbeat Books/Hal Leonard, p. 224. The simplicity and immediacy of Green's playing, which tended to avoid chromaticism, derived from his early work playing rhythm and blues and, although at his best he achieved a synthesis of this style with bop, he was essentially a blues guitarist and returned almost exclusively to this style in his later career.Andrew Waggoner, New Grove Dictionary of Jazz.

Green recorded with Jones for several albums in the mid-1960s. In 1959, Lou Donaldson discovered Green playing in a bar in St. Louis hired him for his touring band. Green moved to New York at some point during 1959‚Äì60. Lou Donaldson introduced Green to Alfred Lion of Blue Note Records. Lion was so impressed that, rather than first using Green as a sideman, as was the usual Blue Note practice, Lion arranged for him to record initially as a group leader. However, due to Green's lack of confidence the initial recording session was only released in 2001 as First Session.\\"Grant Green ‚Äì An Introduction\\", Audio Ideas Guide.[ Review by Ronnie D.

From 1961 to 1965, Green made more appearances on Blue Note LPs, as leader or sideman, than anyone else. Green's first issued album as a leader was Grant's First Stand. This was followed in the same year by Green Street and Grantstand. Grant was named best new star in the Down Beat critics' poll, in 1962.

From 1967 to 1969 Green was, for the most part, inactive due to personal problems and the effects of heroin addiction. In 1969 Green returned with a new funk-influenced band. His recordings from this period include the commercially successful Green Is Beautiful and the soundtrack to the film The Final Comedown. Green left Blue Note again in 1974 and the subsequent recordings he made with other labels divide opinion: some consider Green to have been the 'Father of Acid Jazz' (and his late recordings have been sampled by artists including US3, A Tribe Called Quest and Public Enemy), while others have dismissed them (reissue producer Michael Cuscuna wrote in the sleeve notes for the album Matador: \\"During the 1970s [Green] made some pretty lame records\\"). Green spent much of 1978 in the hospital and, against the advice of doctors, went back on the road to earn money. While in New York to play an engagement at George Benson's Breezin' Lounge, he collapsed in his car of a heart attack and died on January 31, 1979. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, and was survived by six children. Since Green's death, his reputation has grown and many compilations exist, of both his earlier (post-bop/straight ahead and soul jazz) and later (funkier/dancefloor jazz) periods.  Equipment  Green used a Gibson ES-330, then a Gibson L7 with a Gibson McCarty pickguard/pickup, an Epiphone Emperor (with the same pickup) and finally had a custom-built D'Aquisto. According to fellow guitarist George Benson, Grant achieved his tone by turning off the bass and treble settings of his amplifier, and maximizing the midrange. This way he could get his signature punchy, biting tone.

Instead of the 400‚Äì700 nanometre range of the visible light camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000 nm (1 Œºm) to about 14,000 nm (14 Œºm). The practice of capturing and analyzing the data they provide is called thermography.  History  = Discovery and research of infrared radiation = Infrared was discovered in 1800 by Sir William Herschel as a form of radiation beyond red light. These \\"infrared rays\\" (infra is the Latin prefix for \\"below\\") were used mainly for thermal measurement.W. Herschel, \\"Experiments on the refrangibility of the visible rays of the sun\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. 90, pp. 284‚Äì292, 1800. There are four basic laws of IR radiation: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, Stefan-Boltzmann law, Planck's law, and Wien's displacement law. The development of detectors was mainly focused on the use of thermometers and bolometers until World War I. A significant step in the development of detectors occurred in 1829, when Leopoldo Nobili, using the Seebeck effect, created the first known thermocouple, fabricating an improved thermometer, a crude thermopile. He described this instrument to Macedonio Melloni. Initially, they jointly developed a greatly improved instrument. Subsequently, Melloni worked alone, developing an instrument in 1833 (a multielement thermopile) that could detect a person 10 metres away.Barr, E. S. (1962). The infrared pioneers‚ÄîII. Macedonio Melloni. Infrared Physics, 2(2), 67-74. The next significant step in improving detectors was the bolometer, invented in 1880 by Samuel Pierpont Langley. Langley and his assistant Charles Greeley Abbot continued to make improvements in this instrument. By 1901, it had the capability to detect radiation from a cow from 400 metres away, and was sensitive to differences in temperature of one hundred thousandths of a degree Celsius.Barr, E. S. (1962). The infrared pioneers‚ÄîIII. Samuel Pierpoint Langley. Infrared Physics, 3 195-206. The first commercial thermal imaging camera was sold in 1965 for high voltage power line inspections. The first advanced application of IR technology in the civil section may have been a device to detect the presence of icebergs and steamships using a mirror and thermopile, patented in 1913.L. Bellingham, \\"Means for detecting the presence at a distance of icebergs, steamships, and other cool or hot objects,\\" US patent no. 1,158,967. This was soon outdone by the first true IR iceberg detector, which did not use thermopiles, patented in 1914 by R.D. Parker.Parker (R.D.)- Thermic balance or radiometer. U.S. Patent No 1,099,199 June 9, 1914 This was followed up by G.A. Barker's proposal to use the IR system to detect forest fires in 1934.Barker (G.A.) ‚Äì Apparatus for detecting forest fires. U.S. Patent No 1,958,702 May 22, 1934 The technique was not truly industrialized until it was used in the analysis of heating uniformity in hot steel strips in 1935.Nichols (G.T.) ‚Äì Temperature measuring. U.S. Patent No 2,008,793 July 23, 1935 = First thermographic camera = In 1929, Hungarian physicist K√°lm√°n Tihanyi invented the infrared-sensitive (night vision) electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in Britain. The first American thermographic cameras developed were infrared line scanners. This was created by the US military and Texas Instruments in 1947 and took one hour to produce a single image. While several approaches were investigated to improve the speed and accuracy of the technology, one of the most crucial factors dealt with scanning an image, which the AGA company was able to commercialize using a cooled photoconductor. The first infrared linescan system was the British Yellow Duckling of the mid-1950s. This used a continuously rotating mirror and detector, with Y axis scanning by the motion of the carrier aircraft. Although unsuccessful in its intended application of submarine tracking by wake detection, it was applied to land-based surveillance and became the foundation of military IR linescan. This work was further developed at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in the UK when they discovered that mercury cadmium telluride was a photoconductor that required much less cooling. Honeywell in the United States also developed arrays of detectors which could cool at a lower temperature, but they scanned mechanically. This method had several disadvantages which could be overcome using an electronic scanning system. In 1969 Michael Francis Tompsett at English Electric Valve Company in the UK patented a camera which scanned pyro- electronically and which reached a high level of performance after several other breakthroughs throughout the 1970s. Tompsett also proposed an idea for solid-state thermal-imaging arrays, which eventually led to modern hybridized single-crystal-slice imaging devices. = Smart sensors = One of the most important areas of development for security systems was for the ability to intelligently evaluate a signal, as well as warning of a threat's presence. Under the encouragement of the US Strategic Defense Initiative, \\"smart sensors\\" began to appear. These are sensors that could integrate sensing, signal extraction, processing, and comprehension. There are two main types of Smart Sensors. One, similar to what is called a \\"vision chip\\" when used in the visible range, allow for preprocessing using Smart Sensing techniques due to the increase in growth of integrated microcircuitry. The other technology is more oriented to a specific use and fulfills its preprocessing goal through its design and structure.National patent no. 47722‚ó¶/80. Towards the end of the 1990s, the use of infrared was moving towards civil use. There was a dramatic lowering of costs for uncooled arrays, which along with the large increase in developments lead to a dual way use market between civil and military.A. Rogalski, \\"IR detectors: status trends,\\" Progress in Quantum Electronics, vol. 27, pp. 59‚Äì210, 2003.

Theory of operation  A thermal image showing temperature variation in a hot air balloon. Infrared energy is just one part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which encompasses radiation from gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet, a thin region of visible light, infrared, terahertz waves, microwaves, and radio waves. These are all related and differentiated in the length of their wave (wavelength). All objects emit a certain amount of black body radiation as a function of their temperature. Generally speaking, the higher an object's temperature, the more infrared radiation is emitted as black-body radiation. A special camera can detect this radiation in a way similar to the way an ordinary camera detects visible light. It even works in total darkness because ambient light level does not matter. This makes it useful for rescue operations in smoke-filled buildings and underground. A major difference with optical cameras is that the focusing lenses cannot be made of glass, as glass blocks long-wave infrared light. Typically the spectral range of thermal radiation is from 7 to 14 Œºm. Special materials such as Germanium, calcium fluoride, crystalline silicon or newly developed special type of chalcogenide glasses must be used. Except for calcium fluoride all these materials are quite hard and have high refractive index (for germanium n=4) which leads to very high Fresnel reflection from uncoated surfaces (up to more than 30%). For this reason most of the lenses for thermal cameras have antireflective coatings. The higher cost of these special lenses is one reason why thermographic cameras are more costly.  In use  Thermographic image of a ring-tailed lemur Images from infrared cameras tend to be monochrome because the cameras generally use an image sensor that does not distinguish different wavelengths of infrared radiation. Color image sensors require a complex construction to differentiate wavelengths, and color has less meaning outside of the normal visible spectrum because the differing wavelengths do not map uniformly into the system of color vision used by humans. Sometimes these monochromatic images are displayed in pseudo-color, where changes in color are used rather than changes in intensity to display changes in the signal. This technique, called density slicing, is useful because although humans have much greater dynamic range in intensity detection than color overall, the ability to see fine intensity differences in bright areas is fairly limited. For use in temperature measurement the brightest (warmest) parts of the image are customarily colored white, intermediate temperatures reds and yellows, and the dimmest (coolest) parts black. A scale should be shown next to a false color image to relate colors to temperatures. Their resolution is considerably lower than that of optical cameras, mostly only 160 x 120 or 320 x 240 pixels, although more expensive cameras can achieve a resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels. Thermographic cameras are much more expensive than their visible-spectrum counterparts, though low- performance add-on thermal cameras for smartphones became available for hundreds of dollars in 2014.Thermal camera answers age-old question by Fraser Macdonald, 4 October 2014, Hot Stuff Higher-end models are often deemed as dual-use and export-restricted, particularly if the resolution is 640 x 480 or greater, unless the refresh rate is 9 Hz or less. The export of thermal cameras is regulated by International Traffic in Arms Regulations. In uncooled detectors the temperature differences at the sensor pixels are minute; a 1 ¬∞C difference at the scene induces just a 0.03 ¬∞C difference at the sensor. The pixel response time is also fairly slow, at the range of tens of milliseconds. Thermography finds many other uses. For example, firefighters use it to see through smoke, find people, and localize hotspots of fires. With thermal imaging, power line maintenance technicians locate overheating joints and parts, a telltale sign of their failure, to eliminate potential hazards. Where thermal insulation becomes faulty, building construction technicians can see heat leaks to improve the efficiencies of cooling or heating air-conditioning. Hot hooves indicate a sick cow Thermal imaging cameras are also installed in some luxury cars to aid the driver (Automotive night vision), the first being the 2000 Cadillac DeVille. Some physiological activities, particularly responses such as fever, in human beings and other warm-blooded animals can also be monitored with thermographic imaging. Cooled infrared cameras can be found at major astronomy research telescopes, even those that are not infrared telescopes.  Types  warm- and cold-blooded creatures Thermographic cameras can be broadly divided into two types: those with cooled infrared image detectors and those with uncooled detectors. = Cooled infrared detectors = A thermographic image of several lizards Thermal imaging camera & screen, in an airport terminal in Greece. Thermal imaging can detect fever, one of the signs of infection. Cooled detectors are typically contained in a vacuum-sealed case or Dewar and cryogenically cooled. The cooling is necessary for the operation of the semiconductor materials used. Typical operating temperatures range from 4 K to just below room temperature, depending on the detector technology. Most modern cooled detectors operate in the 60 K to 100 K range (-213 to -173 ¬∞C), depending on type and performance level. Without cooling, these sensors (which detect and convert light in much the same way as common digital cameras, but are made of different materials) would be 'blinded' or flooded by their own radiation. The drawbacks of cooled infrared cameras are that they are expensive both to produce and to run. Cooling is both energy-intensive and time-consuming. The camera may need several minutes to cool down before it can begin working. The most commonly used cooling systems are peltier coolers which, although inefficient and limited in cooling capacity, are relatively simple and compact. To obtain better image quality or for imaging low temperature objects Stirling engine cryocoolers are needed. Although the cooling apparatus may be comparatively bulky and expensive, cooled infrared cameras provide greatly superior image quality compared to uncooled ones, particularly of objects near or below room temperature. Additionally, the greater sensitivity of cooled cameras also allow the use of higher F-number lenses, making high performance long focal length lenses both smaller and cheaper for cooled detectors. An alternative to Stirling engine coolers is to use gases bottled at high pressure, nitrogen being a common choice. The pressurised gas is expanded via a micro-sized orifice and passed over a miniature heat exchanger resulting in regenerative cooling via the Joule‚ÄìThomson effect. For such systems the supply of pressurized gas is a logistical concern for field use. Materials used for cooled infrared detection include photodetectors based on a wide range of narrow gap semiconductors including indium antimonide (3-5 Œºm), indium arsenide, mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) (1-2 Œºm, 3-5 Œºm, 8-12 Œºm), lead sulfide, and lead selenide Infrared photodetectors can be created with structures of high bandgap semiconductors such as in Quantum well infrared photodetectors. A number of superconducting and non-superconducting cooled bolometer technologies exist. In principle, superconducting tunneling junction devices could be used as infrared sensors because of their very narrow gap. Small arrays have been demonstrated. They have not been broadly adopted for use because their high sensitivity requires careful shielding from the background radiation. Superconducting detectors offer extreme sensitivity, with some able to register individual photons. For example, ESA's Superconducting camera (SCAM). However, they are not in regular use outside of scientific research. = Uncooled infrared detectors = Uncooled thermal cameras use a sensor operating at ambient temperature, or a sensor stabilized at a temperature close to ambient using small temperature control elements. Modern uncooled detectors all use sensors that work by the change of resistance, voltage or current when heated by infrared radiation. These changes are then measured and compared to the values at the operating temperature of the sensor. Uncooled infrared sensors can be stabilized to an operating temperature to reduce image noise, but they are not cooled to low temperatures and do not require bulky, expensive, energy consuming cryogenic coolers. This makes infrared cameras smaller and less costly. However, their resolution and image quality tend to be lower than cooled detectors. This is due to differences in their fabrication processes, limited by currently available technology. An uncooled thermal camera also needs to deal with its own heat signature. Uncooled detectors are mostly based on pyroelectric and ferroelectric materials or microbolometer technology. The material are used to form pixels with highly temperature-dependent properties, which are thermally insulated from the environment and read electronically. Thermal image of steam locomotive Ferroelectric detectors operate close to phase transition temperature of the sensor material; the pixel temperature is read as the highly temperature- dependent polarization charge. The achieved NETD of ferroelectric detectors with f/1 optics and 320x240 sensors is 70-80 mK. A possible sensor assembly consists of barium strontium titanate bump-bonded by polyimide thermally insulated connection. Silicon microbolometers can reach NETD down to 20 mK. They consist of a layer of amorphous silicon, or a thin film vanadium(V) oxide sensing element suspended on silicon nitride bridge above the silicon-based scanning electronics. The electric resistance of the sensing element is measured once per frame. Current improvements of uncooled focal plane arrays (UFPA) are focused primarily on higher sensitivity and pixel density. In 2013 DARPA announced a five-micron LWIR camera that uses a 1280 x 720 focal plane array (FPA). Some of the materials used for the sensor arrays are amorphous silicon (a-Si), vanadium(V) oxide (VOx), lanthanum barium manganite (LBMO), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), lanthanum doped lead zirconate titanate (PLZT), lead scandium tantalate (PST), lead lanthanum titanate (PLT), lead titanate (PT), lead zinc niobate (PZN), lead strontium titanate (PSrT), barium strontium titanate (BST), barium titanate (BT), antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). Applications The thermographic camera on a Eurocopter EC135 helicopter of the German Federal Police. Originally developed for military use during the Korean War, thermographic cameras have slowly migrated into other fields as varied as medicine and archeology. More recently, the lowering of prices has helped fuel the adoption of infrared viewing technology.

It is served by regional services operated by c2c to and from Fenchurch Street, and by light metro services provided by the DLR to and from Tower Gateway or Bank. On the main line, Limehouse is located from Fenchurch Street and the following station is West Ham; on the DLR it is between Shadwell and Westferry in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was opened by the Commercial Railway (later the London and Blackwall Railway) in 1840 with the name Stepney. At that time, the Commercial Railway had a separate station named Limehouse one stop along the line. Stepney was renamed Stepney East in 1923, and in 1926 the other Limehouse station was closed. Stepney East adopted the current Limehouse name in 1987, just before the DLR opened. History =Early history (1840‚Äì1866)= The station was opened on 6 July 1840 by the Commercial Railway, located in the parish of Stepney within the hamlet of Ratcliff. It was named Stepney, lying between Shadwell and a separate station called Limehouse, located within the Limehouse parish. The initial train service operated between a temporary terminus at Minories and Blackwall until 2 August 1841 when Fenchurch Street opened; the Commercial Railway was then renamed the London and Blackwall Railway (LBR). The service was a rope-powered operation and it was not until 15 February 1849 that steam operation commenced. On 28 September 1850 an extension was opened from Stepney to Bow, to join the LBR with the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR). Increasing congestion on the approaches to Fenchurch Street saw a third line proposed between Fenchurch Street and a junction at George Street (now called Boulcott Street). Discussions about a replacement started in 1853 but it was not until 1 April 1856 that plans were agreed by the LBR board. In the meantime the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) was opened in 1854 operating trains via Stratford railway station to Fenchurch Street. The replacement (existing) station was constructed with a set of platforms (the present-day platforms 1 and 2) to serve the Bow route (as it was then) whilst two further platforms were constructed for the Blackwall line (the Docklands Light Railway platforms occupy this site). It opened on 30 March 1856. In 1858 LTSR trains started operating on the direct route from Barking rather than via the congested Stratford route. Twenty people were injured in a minor collision at the station on 22 November 1861. A Board of Trade report found a signaller's error the primary cause of the incident.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=2521 =Great Eastern Railway ownership (1866‚Äì1922)= In 1866 the Great Eastern Railway (GER) took over the LBR on a long-lease and instigated a series of repairs and in 1869 provided improved signalling arrangements with a new signal box and interlocked signals and block working between adjacent signal boxes. On 9 April 1871 a train from Bow ran through a signal and hit a Blackwall to Fenchurch Street train with the last coach being knocked off the viaduct and landing on a building below. A further accident in 1879 saw the Board of Trade inspector recommend the re-siting of the signal box which was duly provided in 1880. With a frequent train service however Stepney was again the site of an accident in 1874 with 106 injuries, in 1889 where a LTSR locomotive derailed, and in 1892 where another LTSR locomotive was derailed but this time was hit by a GER locomotive killing the LTSR driver. An improved building was provided on the down Bow platform in 1894. In 1895 the fourth line towards Fenchurch Street was opened which helped reduce the number of conflicting moves between trains and thus the risk of accidents. The GER further improved the station in 1900. The LTSR became part of the Midland Railway in 1912. =London Midland & Scottish Railway ownership (1923‚Äì1947)= On 1 January 1923 the Midland Railway became part of the London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) which took over operation of Stepney station. The GER became part of the London & North Eastern Railway on this date and the station was renamed Stepney East on 1 July 1923 to avoid confusion with the Stepney station in Yorkshire. The LBR platforms were closed on 3 May 1926 as passenger services were withdrawn and all services were routed via the Bow platforms. A few goods trains used the Blackwall route but the LBR platforms were demolished in circa 1936 and the junction simplified. The signalling was improved at thisa time as part of a major re-signalling with colour light signals from Fenchurch Street to Gas Factory Junction (east of Stepney). =Railway Nationalisation (1948‚Äì1994)= On 20 February 1949 the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification. The route to Stratford via Bow Road was electrified in 1949 and it was at that time that the former GER suburban services ceased operating leaving Stepney East served only by trains to the former LTSR destinations. No public electric trains ran however until the old LTSR system was electrified in 1961-62 with full electric services commencing on 17 June 1962. The junction to the Blackwall line was removed in 1952 although a siding remained on the viaduct (accessible from the Blackwall end) for scrap metal traffic from Regent Dock which finished in the old Blackwall platforms. Between 1982 and 1992 the station was operated by Network SouthEast, one of British Rail's three passenger business sectors, before being handed over to a business unit in preparation for privatisation. =Docklands Light Railway opens (1987)= On 31 August 1987 the Docklands Light Railway, which operated over the old LBR line, commenced operations, with new platforms (platforms 3 and 4) built on the site of the old LBR platforms; the station had been renamed Limehouse on 11 May that year. The platforms were extended in 1991 to accommodate the DLR's new and longer two- carriage trains. A DLR train arrives at Limehouse, 2002 =The privatisation era (1994‚Äìpresent)= In April 1994 Railtrack became responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure at Limehouse station. Railtrack was succeeded by Network Rail in 2002. In May 1996 the franchise for the London, Tilbury and Southend line was awarded to Prism Rail by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising for a 15-year period with an average annual subsidy of ¬£18.4 million. It began operating as LTS Rail on 26 May 1996. Prism was bought out by National Express who named the franchise c2c in 2003 and continue to operate the station. Since the opening of the DLR, Limehouse has become a well-used interchange for Essex and east London commuters who work in the Canary Wharf area, but the two viaducts remained separate, resulting in an awkward interchange between the DLR platforms and the National Rail platforms, as passengers had to pass down and then up flights of stairs. To remedy this, at least in part, a bridge was built to connect the westbound (London-bound) main line platform with the adjacent eastbound (Canary Wharf-bound) DLR platform. It was originally due for completion by the end of 2008, but was finally opened in November 2009. At the same time as the bridge was being built, other improvements were made, including readying the station for three- carriage operations on the DLR and the construction of an additional eastern entrance, with lifts and stairways for platform access. Limehouse Curve There was also a rail link on a curved viaduct to the east of the station known as the Limehouse Curve. This had opened on 5 April 1880 and was generally used for goods trains heading towards London's docks. There was a short-lived passenger train service between Blackwall and Palace Gates (via Stratford and Seven Sisters) which operated from 1 September 1880 until 1 March 1881. Some special excursion trains also used the curve about this time running from Blackwall to Southend and Southminster on summer Sundays in 1890 and 1891. The Limehouse Curve was last used on 5 November 1962; on 10 May 1963 it was officially abandoned. Design Limehouse station is elevated on a pair of diverging viaducts, each carrying a pair of platforms ‚Äì one pair for National Rail trains and one for the Docklands Light Railway. The National Rail platforms have one entrance accessed via a stairwell at the western end, while the DLR platforms have entrances at both the western and eastern ends, each equipped with stairwells and lifts. The westbound main line platform is connected to the eastbound DLR platform by a walkway bridge. Inside Limehouse station The station holds Secure Stations Scheme accreditation, and bicycle racks are provided underneath the DLR platforms by the western entrance. The ticket office is located within the station building under the main line platforms, and is managed by c2c; tickets can be retailed for National Rail services, the DLR and on Oyster card. Additional automatic ticket machines for DLR and Oyster cards are located under the DLR platforms at the foot of the stairways. There are automatic ticket barriers to the National Rail platforms, but not the DLR, meaning the bridge between the two sets of platforms has its own set of barriers. Services Limehouse is situated in London fare zone 2. The typical off-peak frequency of National Rail services is: * 8 trains per hour to Fenchurch Street. * 4 tph to Shoeburyness via Basildon. * 2 tph to Grays via Rainham * 2 tph to Southend Central via Ockendon. The typical off- peak service frequency for the DLR is: * 15 tph to Bank * 9 tph to Lewisham * 6 tph to Tower Gateway * 6 tph to Beckton * 6 tph to Woolwich Arsenal Connections London Buses routes 15, 115, 135, D3 and night routes N15, N550 and N551 serve the station.

Etymology  Westferry station is in Limehouse and given its proximity to the former Limehouse station on the London & Blackwall Railway, could have been given this name, but instead Stepney East was renamed Limehouse and the DLR station there given that name. West India Quay was reserved for the station at the other end of West India Dock, so there was no obvious choice. There is no place called Westferry; the name is derived from the nearby Westferry Road. Nor was there ever a west ferry. There was a passenger ferry at the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs run by the Greenwich watermen. It was accessed by two roads, East Ferry Road (also known locally as Farm Road) and Westferry Road, built in 1812 when a horse ferry was introduced alongside the passenger ferry. The two roads still exist, running down the centre and west side of the Isle of Dogs respectively. But the road names refer to an ancient service at the far end of the Isle of Dogs from the station. Connections London Buses routes 135, 277, D3, D7 and night routes N277 and N550 serve the station.

Some of his light operas, especially Merrie England, are still performed. As a youth, German played the violin and led the town orchestra of Whitchurch, Shropshire. He also began to compose music. While performing and teaching violin at the Royal Academy of Music, German began to build a career as a composer in the mid-1880s, writing serious music as well as light opera. In 1888, he became music director of Globe Theatre in London. He provided popular incidental music for many productions at the Globe and other London theatres, including Richard III (1889), Henry VIII (1892) and Nell Gwynn (1900). He also wrote symphonies, orchestral suites, symphonic poems and other works.Links to information about German's orchestral works and recordings of them at the Edward German Discography, accessed 16 July 2009 He also wrote a considerable body of songs,Links to information about German's songs and recordings of them at the Edward German Discography, accessed 16 July 2009 piano music, and symphonic suites and other concert music, of which his Welsh Rhapsody (1904) is perhaps best known. German was engaged to finish The Emerald Isle after the death of Arthur Sullivan in 1900, the success of which led to more comic operas, including Merrie England (1902) and Tom Jones (1907). He also wrote the Just So Song Book in 1903 to Rudyard Kipling's texts and continued to write orchestral music. German wrote little new music of his own after 1912, but he continued to conduct until 1928, the year in which he was knighted. Life and career German was born German Edward Jones in Whitchurch, Shropshire, the second of five children and older of two sons of John David Jones, a liquor merchant, brewer, church organist and lay preacher at the local Congregational chapel, and Elizabeth (Betsy) Cox (died 1901), a teacher of Bible classes for young women. His first name was an anglicised form of the Welsh name \\"Garmon.\\"Liner notes for recording of German's Symphony No. 1 and Welsh Rhapsody , beille Musique AMCD, 2006, accessed 15 June 2012 (French) His parents called him Jim.Prince, John. From liner notes for the 2009 recording of Tom Jones, Naxos 2009 He began to study piano and organ with his father at the age of five. At the age of six, he formed a boys' concert band to perform locally, teaching himself the violin, composition, and music arrangement in the process. He later sang alto in the church choir and participated in family entertainments above his uncle's grocery shop, often playing piano duets and performing comic sketches with his elder sister, Ruth, who died when he was 15.Rees, Brian. \\"German, Sir Edward (1862‚Äì1936)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 13 October 2008 He also wrote comic poems. His younger sisters were named Mabel and Rachel. In his mid-teens, German's parents attempted to apprentice him to a shipbuilding firm, as they believed their son had an aptitude for engineering. His studies at a boarding-school in Chester had been delayed by a serious illness, however, and so he was turned away as too old to begin an apprenticeship. In his teens he formed a second band, a quintette, including himself on the violin, his sister on the pianoforte or the bass, and three friends of the family. He prepared the orchestrations for this band. He also led the town orchestra, did some amateur acting, and sang comic songs in local village halls. =The Royal Academy= At the age of 18, he studied privately with Walter Cecil Hay, the conductor of the Whitchurch choral society and director of music at St Chad's, Shrewsbury.\\"Music Staff at St Chad's\\", St Chad's of Shrewsbury, 2012, accessed 9 February 2018 German entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he eventually changed his name to J. E. German (and later simply Edward German) to avoid confusion with another student named Edward Jones. He continued his studies of violin and organ, also beginning a more formal study of composition under Ebenezer Prout.Scowcroft, Philip. \\"Edward German: Serious or Light?\\" MusicWeb-International, 1 December 2001 Many of German's student works were played at Academy concerts.Hulme, David Russell. \\"German: Richard III / Theme and Six Diversions / The Seasons\\", Marco Polo/Naxos liner notes, 1994 In 1884, the Academy appointed German a sub-professor of the violin. During his time as an instructor, he was well regarded and won several medals and prizes, such as the Tubbs Bow for his skill with the violin. In 1885, he won the Charles Lucas Medal for his Te Deum for soloists, choir and organ, leading him to change his focus from violin to composition. He soon wrote a light opera, The Two Poets (for four soloists and piano), in 1886, which was produced at the Academy and then performed at St. George's Hall. In 1887, his first symphony, in E Minor, was also performed at the Academy.\\"German, Sir Edward\\", Profile at the Royal Academy of Music's York Gate Collections (2004) In 1890 he conducted a revised version of this symphony at the Crystal Palace, while The Two Poets toured successfully in England. During his time at the Royal Academy, German taught at Wimbledon School and played the violin in theatre orchestras, including the Savoy Theatre. He visited Germany in 1886 and 1888‚Äì89 and was impressed by its opera, particularly at Bayreuth.Hulme, David Russell. \\"German, Sir Edward\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 14 October 2008 His circle of close friends at the Academy included Dora BrightRees, p. 35 and Ethel Mary Boyce (1863‚Äì1936) from Chertsey, Surrey. He and Boyce became engaged. She was also a promising composition student and won the Lady Goldsmid scholarship in 1885, the Sterndale Bennett Prize in 1886 and the Charles Lucas Medal in 1889. Although the engagement was broken off, they remained friends.Information about Ethel Mary Boyce German never married. =Plays and orchestral music= After leaving the Academy, German continued to teach at Wimbledon School and to play the violin in orchestras at various London theatres, including the Savoy. In 1888, an introduction by conductor Alberto Randegger to theatre manager Richard Mansfield led to German's appointment as conductor and musical director at the Globe Theatre in London. There he improved the orchestra and began providing incidental music for the theatre's lavish productions, starting with Richard III in 1889. This music was well received (The Times called for a concert suite to be arranged),The Times, 18 March 1889, p. 7 and the overture soon became popular in concert halls. This eventually led to other incidental music commissions that gained success. In 1892, German composed music for a production of Henry Irving's version of Henry VIII at the Lyceum Theatre, London, where he incorporated elements of traditional old English dance. Within a year, sheet music of the dance numbers from the play's score had sold 30,000 copies. German was by then in great demand to write music for plays. His commissions included Henry Arthur Jones's The Tempter in 1893, Johnston Forbes-Robertson's Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum in 1895, Herbert Beerbohm Tree's productions of As You Like It (1896) and Much Ado about Nothing (1898), and Anthony Hope's English Nell (later known as Nell Gwynn) in 1900, starring Marie Tempest. At the same time, German was writing music for the concert hall, sometimes adapting music from his theatrical scores. His Gipsy Suite met with success similar to that of his overture to Richard III and his popular Henry VIII and Nell Gwynn dances. All were written in \\"a distinctive, if limited, 'olde English' manner, a species of musical mock Tudor with which German came to be particularly associated.\\" He also wrote a number of successful drawing-room songs and solo piano pieces during this time. The success of German's theatrical and concert hall music led to his receiving commissions from orchestral music festivals, including his second symphony for the Norwich Festival in 1893. The young critic George Bernard Shaw complained that German's symphonies were limited by the composer's indulgence in a theatricality out of place in symphonic writing. German was thin-skinned, and after receiving this criticism, he wrote no more symphonies. German tried to avoid this charge in the future by characterising his large-scale four-movement works as \\"symphonic suites\\". Successful orchestral works included suites for the Leeds Festival in 1895 and The Seasons for Norwich in 1899, and a symphonic poem, Hamlet, at Birmingham in 1897, conducted by Hans Richter. He had planned a violin concerto for the 1901 Leeds Festival, but this was never completed, as German instead turned to light opera. In 1902, he produced a Rhapsody on March Themes for the Brighton Festival. =Comic operas= Though German had little experience with opera or choral music, Richard D'Oyly Carte invited him to finish Arthur Sullivan's The Emerald Isle for the Savoy Theatre after Sullivan's death in 1900.Stone, David. \\"Edward German\\" , Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 2001 He accepted, giving up his violin concerto commission for the Leeds Festival to meet the deadlines. The success of his score for the opera (which was performed into the 1920s) opened up a new career for him. His next comic opera, in 1902, was Merrie England, with Basil Hood, the librettist for The Emerald Isle. This was perhaps German's greatest success, and its dance music was popular separately. It was revived frequently, becoming a light-opera standard in Britain, while several of its songs, including \\"The English Rose\\", \\"O Peaceful England\\" and \\"The Yeomen of England\\", remained popular until the middle of the 20th century. Merrie England has been so frequently chosen by amateur groups in England that it probably has been performed more often than any other British opera or operetta written in the 20th century. Gilbert, Workman and German at a rehearsal After this, German and Hood collaborated again in 1903 to write A Princess of Kensington. This opera was unsuccessful, although it toured briefly and had a New York production. German turned to other endeavours, composing music to Rudyard Kipling texts, including the twelve songs in the Just So Song Book in 1903. He also received a steady flow of orchestral commissions, leading to works such as his Welsh Rhapsody for the Cardiff Festival in 1904, featuring as its climax \\"Men of Harlech\\". German returned to writing comic operas, achieving another success with Tom Jones for the Apollo Theatre in 1907, produced by Robert Courtneidge for the Fielding bicentenary. The score is one of German's finest works. It received a production in New York, with German conducting, and was performed for decades, spawning separate performances of its dance music. He next collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on his final (and unsuccessful) opera, Fallen Fairies, at the Savoy in 1909. With German's agreement, Gilbert cast his protege, Nancy McIntosh, as the Fairy Queen, Selene. Critics found her performance weak. Shortly after the opening, the producer C. H. Workman, acting at the request of the syndicate he had gathered, replaced McIntosh with Amy Evans and asked for restoration of a song that Gilbert had cut during rehearsals. Gilbert was outraged and threatened to sue, demanding that German join him. This placed German in a distressing position, and the composer, who habitually preferred to avoid legal battles, declined.Morrison, Robert. \\"The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera\\", Fallen Fairies, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006) In maintaining the Savoy tradition of comic opera, German was composing a style of piece for which public taste had dwindled as fashions in musical theatre had changed with the new century. =Later years= In the wake of the failure of Fallen Fairies and his unhappy experience with it, German effectively ended his career as a composer of new works, only returning to composition on a few rare occasions. In 1911 he became the first composer to write music for a British film; he was commissioned for 50 guineas to write 16 bars of music for the coronation scene in the film Henry VIII. The same year, he composed his march and hymn for the coronation of King George V.Russell Hulme (2001), pp. 703‚Äì705 German in later years Among the few works of his later years was the Theme and Six Diversions in 1919, and his final major work, the Othello-inspired tone poem The Willow Song in 1922. After that, German all but ceased composing. Correspondence shows that he felt uncomfortable with the changing musical styles, such as jazz and modernist classical music. Like Sullivan before him, he regretted that his popularity stemmed mostly from his comic operas. However, German was a perfectionist and continually revised his works and produced new arrangements for publication. He also recorded some of them and encouraged their production and broadcast on the radio. German lived, from 1886, in Hall Road, Maida Vale, near Lord's Cricket Ground, where he was an avid enthusiast of that game. He lived a quiet life, enjoying walking, cycling and fishing, though he often attended the theatre.Irving, Ernest. Cue for Music (1959), pp. 47‚Äì51 He developed a strong friendship with Sir Edward Elgar. German was injured in a road accident during World War I, but continued to be a highly sought-after conductor, accepting many conducting engagements, until he suffered an eye condition that left him blind in his right eye in 1928. He was the first British conductor invited by Dan Godfrey to conduct his own music at Bournemouth. Beginning in 1916, he was also one of the first composers to conduct his own music for recording, producing full renderings of Merrie England and Theme and Six Diversions. German was knighted in 1928, when the respect in which he was held by fellow musicians was shown by the number of eminent musicians who attended the celebratory dinner, including Elgar, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Sir Hugh Allen, Sir Landon Ronald, and Lord Berners.The Times, 30 March 1928, p. 14 In 1934 German received the Royal Philharmonic Society's highest honour, its gold medal, presented by Sir Thomas Beecham at an RPS concert.The Times, 20 April 1934, p. 12 He was elected an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1936, and he was a leader of the Performing Rights Society, which fought for composers' rights to fair compensation for the performances of their works. German lived long enough to witness the beginning of a decline in the popularity of his orchestral works. A note found after his death bears this poignant message: \\"I die a disappointed man because my serious orchestral works have not been recognised\\". However, his best-known orchestral pieces are still occasionally performed, and his light operas Merrie England and Tom Jones continue to receive productions, at least by amateur companies, and professional recordings, including a 2009 Naxos version of Tom Jones.

Analysis The music scholar David Russell Hulme wrote of German that French influences are clearly apparent in his music \\"and there are even occasional reminders of Tchaikovsky, but paradoxically he was, like Elgar, a stylistic cosmopolitan who wrote music that is quintessentially English.\\" Hulme also observes that though he is seen as Sullivan's successor, German's music is quite different in style, and his lyric ballads especially show \\"a romantic warmth that struck a new note in British operetta\\". The Times, too, noted that German was so frequently spoken of as Sullivan's successor that his contemporaries failed to notice that he was \\"an artist of genius\\" in his own right.The Times obituary, 12 November 1936, p. 16 Many of German's colleagues in the musical establishment did, however, find his work to be of the highest quality, including Elgar and Sir John Barbirolli. A recording of his Richard III, Theme and Six Diversions and The Seasons was released by Naxos in 1994. Hulme writes that \\"German's orchestral music certainly does not deserve the neglect it has suffered, for it still has much to offer modern audiences. Beautifully crafted, colourful and vital, its pleasing and distinctive personality is still capable of inspiring the kind of affectionate regard it once so readily kindled.\\" Edward German Festival The first Edward German Festival was held in 2006 in German's birth town, Whitchurch, Shropshire. Events included performances by festival patron and cellist, Julian Lloyd Webber and a concert version of German's best-known work, Merrie England.\\"Whitchurch celebrates music of famous son\\", BBC Home 2006 Another festival was held on 23‚Äì28 April 2009, sponsored by the Friends of Whitchurch Heritage.

He promoted interdisciplinary and quantitative methods, often with an emphasis on the Midwest. His best known publication is his essay \\"The Significance of the Frontier in American History\\", the ideas of which formed the Frontier Thesis. He argued that the moving western frontier exerted a strong influence on American democracy and the American character from the colonial era until 1890. He is also known for his theories of geographical sectionalism. During recent years historians and academics have argued frequently over Turner's work; all agree that the Frontier Thesis has had an enormous effect on historical scholarship.

He graduated from the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison) in 1884, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. He earned his PhD in history from Johns Hopkins University in 1890 with a thesis on the Wisconsin fur trade, titled \\"The Character and Influence of the Indian Trade in Wisconsin\\", directed by Herbert Baxter Adams. Turner did not publish extensively; his influence came from tersely expressed interpretive theories (published in articles), which influenced his hundreds of disciples. Two theories, in particular, were influential, the \\"Frontier Thesis\\" and the \\"Sectional Hypothesis\\". Although he published little, he had an encyclopedic knowledge of American history, earning a reputation by 1910 as one of the two or three most influential historians in the country. He proved adept at promoting his ideas and his students, for whom he obtained jobs in major universities, including Merle Curti and Marcus Lee Hansen. He circulated copies of his essays and lectures to important scholars and literary people, published extensively in magazines, recycled favorite material, attaining the largest possible audience for major concepts, and wielded considerable influence within the American Historical Association as an officer and advisor for the American Historical Review. His emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the major history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history compatible with Turner's theories.Allan G. Bogue, \\"Frederick Jackson Turner Reconsidered,\\" The History Teacher, (1994), p. 195. in JSTOR Annoyed by the university regents who demanded less research and more teaching and state service, Turner sought an environment that would permit him to do more research.Allan G. Bogue, \\"'Not by Bread Alone': The Emergence of the Wisconsin Idea and the Departure of Frederick Jackson Turner.\\" Wisconsin Magazine of History 2002 86(1): 10‚Äì23. Declining offers from California, he accepted an offer from Harvard in 1910 and remained a professor there until 1922, being succeeded in 1924 by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. In 1907 Turner was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society,American Antiquarian Society Members Directory and in 1911 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Turner was never comfortable at Harvard; when he retired in 1922 he became a visiting scholar at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, where his note cards and files continued to accumulate, although few monographs got published. His The Frontier in American History (1920) was a collection of older essays. As a professor of history at Wisconsin (1890‚Äì1910) and Harvard (1910‚Äì1922), Turner trained scores of disciples who in turn dominated American history programs throughout the country. His model of sectionalism as a composite of social forces, such as ethnicity and land ownership, encouraged historians to use social history to analyze social, economic and political developments of American history. At the American Historical Association, he collaborated with J. Franklin Jameson on numerous major projects. Turner's theories became unfashionable during the 1960s, as critics complained that he neglected regionalism. They complained that he claimed too much egalitarianism and democracy for a frontier that was restrictive for women and minorities. After Turner's death his former colleague Isaiah Bowman had this to say of his work: \\"Turner's ideas were curiously wanting in evidence from field studies...He represents a type of historian who rests his case on documents and general impression rather than a scientist who goes out for to see.\\" Robert H. Block. \\"Frederick Jackson Turner And American Geography.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

Turner believed that because of his own biases and the amount of conflicting historical evidence that any one method of historical interpretation would be insufficient, that an interdisciplinary method was the most accurate way to analyze history.Wilbur R. Jacobs. \\"Wider Frontiers: Questions of War and Conflict in American History: The Strange Solution by Frederick Jackson Turner\\".

Works =Frontier thesis= Turner's \\"Frontier Thesis\\" was developed in a scholarly paper of 1893, \\"The Significance of the Frontier in American History\\", read before the American Historical Association in Chicago during the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago World's Fair). He believed the spirit and success of the United States was associated directly with the country's westward expansion. Turner expounded an evolutionary model; he had been influenced by work with geologists at Wisconsin. The West, not the East, was where distinctively American characteristics emerged. The creation of the unique American identity occurred at the juncture between the civilization of settlement and the savagery of wilderness. This produced a new type of citizen ‚Äì one with the power to tame the wild and one upon whom the wild had conferred strength and individuality. As each generation of pioneers relocated 50 to 100 miles west, they abandoned useless European practices, institutions and ideas, and instead found new solutions to new problems created by their new environment. Over multiple generations, the frontier produced characteristics of informality, violence, crudeness, democracy and initiative that the world recognized as \\"American\\". Turner ignored gender and race, and did not emphasize class. Historians of the 1960s and later stressed that race, class and gender were major influencers of history. The new generation stressed gender, ethnicity, professional categorization, and the contrasting victor and victim legacies of manifest destiny and imperialist expansion. Some criticized Turner's frontier thesis and the theme of American exceptionalism. The disunity of the concept of the West and the similarity of American expansion to European colonialism and imperialism during the 19th century, and the lack of complete egalitarianism even on the frontier revealed the limits of Turnerian and exceptionalist paradigms.Scharff et al, 2000. =Sectionalism= Turner's sectionalism essays are collected in The Significance of Sections in American History, which won the Pulitzer Prize in History in 1933. Turner's sectionalism thesis had almost as much influence among historians as his frontier thesis, but never became widely known to the general public as did the frontier thesis. He argued that different ethnocultural groups had distinct settlement patterns, and this revealed itself in politics, economics and society. Influence and legacy Turner's ideas influenced many types of historiography. Concerning the history of religion, for example, Boles (1993) notes that William Warren Sweet at the University of Chicago Divinity School argued that churches adapted to the characteristics of the frontier, creating new denominations such as the LDS Church, the Church of Christ, the Disciples of Christ, and the Cumberland Presbyterians. The frontier, they argued, created uniquely American institutions such as revivals, camp meetings, and itinerant preaching. This opinion dominated religious historiography for decades.John B. Boles, \\"Turner, The Frontier, and the Study of Religion in America,\\" Journal of the Early Republic (1993) 13#2 pp. 205‚Äì16. in JSTOR Moos (2002) says that the 1910s to 1940s black filmmaker and novelist Oscar Micheaux incorporated Turner's frontier thesis into his work. Micheaux promoted the West as a place where blacks could transcend race and earn economic success through diligent work and perseverance.Dan Moos, \\"Reclaiming the Frontier: Oscar Micheaux as Black Turnerian,\\" African American Review (2002) 36#3 pp. 357‚Äì81 in JSTOR Slatta (2001) maintains that the widespread popularization of Turner's frontier thesis influenced popular histories, motion pictures, and novels, which characterize the West in terms of individualism, frontier violence, and rough justice. Disneyland's Frontierland of the late 20th century represented the myth of rugged individualism that celebrated what was perceived to be the American heritage. The public has ignored academic historians', David J. Weber for example, anti-Turnerian models, largely because they conflict with and often destroy the legends of Western heritage. However, the work of historians during the 1980s‚Äì1990s, some of whom sought to discredit Turner's conception of the frontier and others who have sought to spare the concept while presenting a more balanced and nuanced version of it, have done much to place Western myths in context.Richard W. Slatta, \\"Taking Our Myths Seriously.\\" Journal of the West (2001) 40#3 pp. 3‚Äì5. The Frederick Jackson Turner Award is given annually by the Organization of American Historians for an author's first scholarly book on American history. Turner's former home in Madison, Wisconsin is located in what is now the Langdon Street Historic District. In 2009 he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Marriage, family, and death Turner married Caroline Mae Sherwood in Chicago in November 1889. They had three children: only one survived childhood. Dorothy Kinsley Turner (later Main) was the mother of the historian Jackson Turner Main (1917‚Äì2003), a scholar of Revolutionary America who married a fellow scholar. Frederick Jackson Turner died in 1932 in San Marino, California, where he had been a research associate at the Huntington Library.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines penology as \\"the study of the punishment of crime and prison management,\\" and in this sense it is equivalent with corrections. Penology is concerned with the effectiveness of those social processes devised and adopted for the prevention of crime, via the repression or inhibition of criminal intent via the fear of punishment. The study of penology therefore deals with the treatment of prisoners and the subsequent rehabilitation of convicted criminals. It also encompasses aspects of probation (rehabilitation of offenders in the community) as well as penitentiary science relating to the secure detention and retraining of offenders committed to secure institutions. Penology concerns many topics and theories, including those concerning prisons (prison reform, prisoner abuse, prisoners' rights, and recidivism), as well as theories of the purposes of punishment (deterrence, retribution, incapacitation and rehabilitation). Contemporary penology concerns itself mainly with criminal rehabilitation and prison management. The word seldom applies to theories and practices of punishment in less formal environments such as parenting, school and workplace correctional measures. History Cesare Beccaria, Dei delitti e delle pene Dei delitti e delle pene (1766), frontpage, 6th edition. Historical theories were based on the notion that fearful consequences would discourage potential offenders. An example of this principle can be found in the Draconian law of Ancient Greece and the Bloody Code which persisted in Renaissance England, when (at various times) capital punishment was prescribed for over 200 offenses. Similarly, certain hudud offenses under Sharia hadith tradition may incur fearful penalties. Modern theories of the punishment and rehabilitation of offenders are broadly based on principles articulated in the seminal pamphlet \\"On Crimes and Punishments\\" published by Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria in 1764. They center on the concept of proportionality. In this respect, they differ from many previous systems of punishment, for example, England's Bloody Code, under which the penalty of theft had been the same regardless of the value stolen, giving rise to the English expression \\"It is as well to be hanged for a sheep or a lamb\\". Subsequent development of the ideas of Beccaria made non-lethal punishment more acceptable. Consequently, convicted prisoners had to be re-integrated into society when their punishment was complete.Marcello Maestro, \\"A pioneer for the abolition of capital punishment: Cesare Beccaria.\\" Journal of the History of Ideas 34.3 (1973): 463-468. online Penologists have consequently evolved occupational and psychological education programs for offenders detained in prison, and a range of community service and probation orders which entail guidance and aftercare of the offender within the community. The importance of inflicting some measure of punishment on those persons who breach the law is however maintained in order to maintain social order and to moderate public outrage which might provoke appeals for cruel vengeance. In modern times Penology has shifted from a retributive based punishment to a form of community corrections. \\"Community corrections involves the management and supervision of offenders in the community. These offenders are serving court-imposed orders either as an alternative to imprisonment or as a condition of their release on parole from prison. This means they must report regularly to their community corrections officer and may have to participate in unpaid community work and rehabilitation programs.\\"  See also  * Auburn System * Zebulon Brockway * Elmira Correctional Facility * Her Majesty's Prison Service * Panopticon * Penal transportation * Prison reform References  Further reading  * Diiulio, John J., Governing Prisons: A Comparative Study of Correctional Management, Simon and Schuster, 1990.

The gens traced its origin to the earliest days of the Roman Republic. The first of the Claudii to obtain the consulship was Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis, in 495 BC, and from that time its members frequently held the highest offices of the state, both under the Republic and in imperial times.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 762 (\\"Claudia Gens\\"). Plebeian Claudii are found fairly early in Rome's history. Some may have been descended from members of the family who had passed over to the plebeians, while others were probably the descendants of freedmen of the gens. In the later Republic, one of its patrician members voluntarily converted to plebeian status and adopted the form \\"Clodius\\". In his life of the emperor Tiberius, who was a scion of the Claudii, the historian Suetonius gives a summary of the gens, and says, \\"as time went on it was honoured with twenty-eight consulships, five dictatorships, seven censorships, six triumphs, and two ovations.\\" Writing several decades after the fall of the so-called \\"Julio-Claudian dynasty\\", Suetonius took care to mention both the good and wicked deeds attributed to members of the family.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Tiberius\\", 1‚Äì3. The patrician Claudii were noted for their pride and arrogance, and intense hatred of the commonalty. In his History of Rome, Niebuhr writes, > That house during the course of centuries produced several very eminent, few > great men; hardly a single noble-minded one. In all ages it distinguished > itself alike by a spirit of haughty defiance, by disdain for the laws, and > iron hardness of heart.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. I, p. 599. During the Republic, no patrician Claudius adopted a member of another gens; the emperor Claudius was the first who broke this custom, by adopting Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, afterwards the emperor Nero.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Claudius\\", 39.Tacitus, Annales, xii. Origin According to legend, the first of the Claudii was a Sabine, by the name of Attius Clausus, who came to Rome with his retainers in 504 BC, the sixth year of the Republic.Livy, ii. 16 At this time, the fledgling Republic was engaged in regular warfare with the Sabines, and Clausus is said to have been the leader of a faction seeking to end the conflict. When his efforts failed, he defected to the Romans, bringing with him no fewer than five hundred men able to bear arms, according to Dionysius.Dionysius, v. 40. Clausus, who exchanged his Sabine name for the Latin Appius Claudius, was enrolled among the patricians, and given a seat in the Senate, quickly becoming one of its most influential members.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Tiberius\\", 1. His descendants were granted a burial site at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, and his followers allotted land on the far side of the Anio, where they formed the core of what became the \\"Old Claudian\\" tribe. The emperor Claudius is said to have referred to these traditions in a speech made before the senate, in which he argued in favor of admitting Gauls to that body. \\"My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and a noble of Rome, encourage me to govern by the same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever found.\\"Tacitus, Annales, xi. 24. By imperial times, the influence of the Claudii was so great that the poet Virgil flattered them by a deliberate anachronism. In his Aeneid, he makes Attius Clausus a contemporary of Aeneas, to whose side he rallies with a host of quirites, or spearmen.Aeneid, book vii, lines 706, 707. The nomen Claudius, originally Clausus, is usually said to be derived from the Latin adjective claudus, meaning \\"lame\\". As a cognomen, Claudus is occasionally found in other gentes. However, since there is no tradition that any of the early Claudii were lame, the nomen might refer to some ancestor of Attius Clausus. It could also have been metaphorical, or ironic, and the possibility remains that this derivation is erroneous. The metathesis of Clausus into Claudius, and its common by-form, Clodius, involves the alternation of 'o' and 'au', which seems to have been common in words of Sabine origin. The alternation of 's' and 'd' occurs in words borrowed from Greek: Latin rosa from Greek rhodon; but in this instance clausus or *closus is a Sabine word becoming clod- in Latin. The name could have come from Greek settlers in Latium, but there is no evidence in favor of this hypothesis.Dictionnaire √©tymologique latin, p. 44.Dictionnaire √©tymologique de la langue latine, p. 126. Praenomina The early Claudii favored the praenomina Appius, Gaius, and Publius. These names were used by the patrician Claudii throughout their history. Tiberius was used by the family of the Claudii Nerones, while Marcus, although used occasionally by the earliest patrician Claudii, was favored by the plebeian branches of the family.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, pp. 765‚Äì775 (\\"Claudius\\"). According to Suetonius, the gens avoided the praenomen Lucius because two early members with this name had brought dishonor upon the family, one having been convicted of highway robbery, and the other of murder. However, the name was used by at least one branch of the Claudii in the final century of the Republic, including one who, as Rex Sacrorum, was certainly patrician. To these names, the plebeian Claudii added Quintus and Sextus. The praenomen Appius is often said to have been unique to the Claudii, and nothing more than a Latinization of the Sabine Attius. But in fact there are other figures in Roman history named \\"Appius\\", and in later times the name was used by plebeian families such as the Junii and the Annii. Thus, it seems more accurate to say that the Claudii were the only patrician family at Rome known to have used Appius. As for its Sabine equivalent, Attius has been the subject of much discussion by philologists. The form Attus is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, who connected it with the bucolic Greek name Atys. Braasch translated it as V√§terchen, \\"little father,\\" and connected it with a series of childhood parental names: \\"atta, tata, acca,\\" and the like, becoming such names as Tatius (also Sabine) and Atilius.Braasch, pp. 7-8. During the late Republic and early Empire, the Claudii Nerones, who gave rise to the Imperial family, adopted the praenomen Decimus, seldom used by any patrician family. Subsequently they began to exchange traditional praenomina for names that first entered the family as cognomina, such as Nero, Drusus, and Germanicus. Branches and cognomina The patrician Claudii bore various surnames, including Caecus, Caudex, Centho, Crassus, Nero, Pulcher, Regillensis, and Sabinus. The latter two, though applicable to all of the gens, were seldom used when there was a more definite cognomen. A few of the patrician Claudii are mentioned without any surname. The surnames of the plebeian Claudii were Asellus, Canina, Centumalus, Cicero, Flamen, Glaber, and Marcellus. The earliest Claudii bore the surname Sabinus, a common surname usually referring to a Sabine, or someone of Sabine descent, which according to all tradition, the Claudii were. This cognomen was first adopted by Appius Claudius, the founder of the gens, and was retained by his descendants, until it was replaced by Crassus. Regillensis or Inregillensis, a surname of the earliest Claudii, is said to be derived from the town of Regillum, a Sabine settlement, where Appius Claudius lived with his family and retainers before coming to Rome. Its exact location is unknown, but it must have been in the vicinity of Lake Regillus, where one of the most important battles in the early history of the Roman Republic was fought. The same cognomen was borne by a family of the Postumii, although in this instance the surname is supposed to have been derived from the Battle of Lake Regillus, in which the victorious Roman general was the dictator Aulus Postumius Albus.Livy, xxx. 45.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. i, p. 556. Crassus, sometimes given as the diminutive Crassinus, was a common surname usually translated as \\"thick, solid,\\" or \\"dull\\".Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary, \\"Crassus\\". This cognomen succeeded that of Sabinus as the surname of the main family of the Claudia gens. It was borne by members of the family from the fifth to the third century BC. The other main families of the patrician Claudii were descended from Appius Claudius Caecus, the last recorded member of the Claudii Crassi, who gave a different cognomen to each of his four sons: Russus (or Rufus), Pulcher, Cento or Centho, and Nero. Pulcher, the surname of the next major branch of the Claudia gens, means beautiful, although it may be that the cognomen was given ironically.Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary, \\"Pulcher\\". The Claudii Pulchri were an extensive family, which supplied the Republic with several consuls, and survived into imperial times.Claudius, Fourth Roman Emperor The other main branch of the patrician Claudii bore the surname Nero, originally a Sabine praenomen described as meaning, fortis ac strenuus, which roughly translated is \\"strong and sturdy.\\" It may be the same as the Umbrian praenomen Nerius. This family was distinguished throughout the latter Republic, and gave rise to several of the early emperors, including Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. An oddity of the names by which these emperors are known today is that several of their ancestors bore the name Tiberius Claudius Nero; of three emperors belonging to the same family, one is known by a praenomen, one by a nomen, and one by a cognomen. The most illustrious family of the plebeian Claudii bore the surname Marcellus, which is a diminutive of the praenomen Marcus. They gained everlasting fame from the exploits of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, one of Rome's finest generals, and a towering figure of the Second Punic War, who was five times consul, and won the spolia opima, defeating and killing the Gallic king, Viridomarus, in single combat.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 927 (\\"Marcellus\\", no. 2). Most of those who used the spelling Clodius were descended from plebeian members of the gens, but one family by this name was a cadet branch of the patrician Claudii Pulchri, which voluntarily went over to the plebeians, and used the spelling Clodius to differentiate themselves from their patrician relatives.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 771 (\\"Claudius\\", no. 40). Caecus, the surname of one of the Claudii Crassi, refers to the condition of his blindness, which is well-attested, although it appears that he did not become blind until his old age. Caecus' initial cognomen was Crassus.Frontinus, De aquaeductu, i. 5, who only gives his original cognomen, \\"Crassus\\".Humm, Appius Claudius Caecus, p. 35. According to one legend, he was struck blind by the gods during his censorship, after inducing the ancient family of the Potitii to teach the sacred rites of Hercules to the public slaves. The Potitii themselves were said to have perished as a result of this sacrilege. However, Claudius was relatively young at the time of his censorship in 312 BC, and was elected consul sixteen years later, in 296.Livy, ix. 29. Caecus' brother, who shared the same praenomen, was distinguished by the cognomen Caudex, literally meaning a \\"treetrunk\\", although metaphorically it was an insult, meaning a \\"dolt.\\" According to Seneca, he obtained the surname from his attention to naval affairs.Seneca the Younger, De Brevitate Vitae, 13.

A prot√©g√© of King Tubby (Osbourne Ruddock), Scientist's contemporaries include several figures who, working at King Tubby's studio, had helped pioneer the genre in the 1970s: Ruddock, Bunny Lee, Philip Smart, Pat Kelly and Prince Jammy. The 1970s: King Tubby's, Channel One, and Studio One Scientist was introduced to electronics by his father, who worked as a television and radio repair technician.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) \\"The Rough Guide to Reggae\\", Rough Guides, He began building his own amplifiers and would buy transformers from Tubby's Dromilly Road studio. While at the studio, Scientist asked Tubby to give him a chance at mixing. He was taken on at Tubby's as an assistant, performing tasks such as winding transformer coils, and began working as a mixer in the mid-1970s, initially creating dubs of reworked Studio One tracks for Don Mais's Roots Tradition label, given his chance when Prince Jammy cut short a mixing session for Mais because he was too tired to continue. His name originated from a comment by Tubby to Bunny Lee, with regard to his technical proficiency, \\"Damn, this little boy must be a scientist.\\" He left King Tubby's at the end of the 1970s and became the principal engineer for Channel One when hired by the Hoo Kim brothers, giving him the chance to work on a 16-track mixing desk rather than the four tracks at Tubby's.Larkin, Colin (1998) \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", Virgin Books, The 1980s: King Tubby's, Tuff Gong Scientist came to prominence in the early 1980s and produced many albums, his mixes featuring on many releases in the first part of the decade. He made a series of albums in the early 1980s, released on Greensleeves Records with titles themed around Scientist's fictional achievements in fighting Space Invaders, Pac-Men, and Vampires, and winning the World Cup. The music on these albums was played by Roots Radics, his most frequent collaborators. In particular, he was the favourite engineer of Henry \\"Junjo\\" Lawes, for whom he mixed several albums featuring the Roots Radics, many based on tracks by Barrington Levy. He also did a lot of work for Linval Thompson and Jah Thomas. In 1982 he left Channel One to work at Tuff Gong studio as second engineer to Errol Brown. Scientist worked as an engineer in recording studios in the Washington, D.C. area starting in 1985. Licensing issues Scientist has alleged in court that Greensleeves originally released albums without his knowledge, according to his interview with United Reggae online magazine. After this, Dub –ú–∏—Ä label began working directly with Scientist to reissue his best-known work. In 2016, Greensleeves removed the Scientist moniker for a run of reissues, substituting titles such as Junjo Presents: Wins The World Cup.

While the prisoners may have been released once the sentences were served, they generally did not have the resources to return home.  Origin and implementation  Banishment or forced exile from a polity or society has been used as a punishment since at least Ancient Roman times. The practice reached its height in the British Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries. Transportation removed the offender from society, mostly permanently, but was seen as more merciful than capital punishment. This method was used for criminals, debtors, military prisoners, and political prisoners. Penal transportation was also used as a method of colonization. For example, from the earliest days of English colonial schemes, new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and the poor as well as to increase the colonial labour force, for the overall benefit of the realm.August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth, Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. Originally published by His Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1911. \\"The Parliament of England taking into their care the maintenance and advance of the Traffick Trade, and several Manufactures of this Nation; and being desirous to improve and multiply the same for the best advantage and benefit thereof, to the end that ye poore people of this Land may be set on work, and their Families preserved from Beggary and Ruine, and that the Commonwealth might be enriched thereby, and no occasion left either for Idleness or Poverty:...\\" Great Britain and the British Empire Initially based on the royal prerogative of mercy,Acts of the Privy Council of England Colonial Series, Vol. I, 1613-1680, p.12. (1908) and later under English Law, transportation was an alternative sentence imposed for a felony. It was typically imposed for offences for which death was deemed too severe. By 1670, as new felonies were defined, the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed.Egerton, Hugh Edward,A short history of British colonial policy, p.40 (1897)Charles II, 1670 & 1671: An Act to prevent the malitious burning of Houses, Stackes of Corne and Hay and killing or maiming of Catle. Forgery of a document, for example, was a capital crime until the 1820s, when the penalty was reduced to transportation. Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed for a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving his time, but had to make his own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony. England transported its convicts and political prisoners, as well as prisoners of war from Scotland and Ireland, to its overseas colonies in the Americas from the 1610s until early in the American Revolution in 1776, when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c. 43).\\"An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\\" The practice was mandated in Scotland by an act of 1785, but was less used there than in England. Transportation on a large scale resumed with the departure of the First Fleet to Australia in 1787, and continued there until 1868. Transportation was not used by Scotland before the Act of Union 1707; following union, the Transportation Act 1717 specifically excluded its use in Scotland.Transportation Act 1717, Section 8, p.475 Under the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3 c. 46) the Parliament of Great Britain specifically extended the usage of transportation to Scotland.\\"An act for the effectual transportation of felons, and other offenders, in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and to authorize the removal of prisoners in certain places.\\" It remained little used under Scots Law until the early 19th century. In Australia, a convict who had served part of his time might apply for a ticket of leave, permitting some prescribed freedoms. This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life, to marry and raise a family, and to contribute to the development of the colony. =Historical background= The trend towards more flexibility of sentencing Neptune, a 19th- century convict ship that brought prisoners to Australia In England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe, later termed the Bloody Code. This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals. With modifications to the traditional benefit of clergy, which originally exempted only clergymen from the general criminal law, it developed into a legal fiction by which many common offenders of \\"clergyable\\" offences were extended the privilege to avoid execution.Beattie, 1986, p. 470 Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the rule of law, it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself.Beattie, 1986, p. 472 Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system.Beattie, 1986, p. 473 There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of James I, a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners \\"for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas\\".Acts of the Privy Council (Colonial), vol.

Not only did his agents systematically capture Irish youths and girls for export to the West Indies, but all the garrison who were not killed in the Drogheda Massacre were shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes.\\" and civilian prisoners.30 July 1649 Act empowering the Lord Mayor, Justices of Gaol delivery for Newgate, to transport threescore prisoners convicted of Felony and other heinous crimes, unto the Summer Islands or other new English Plantations. With the Restoration, the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it, started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720, with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after branding the thumb. Alternatively, under the second act dealing with Moss-trooper brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge's discretion, were to be transported to America, \\"there to remaine and not to returne\\".Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80, p.598Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3 p.581 There were various influential agents of change: judges' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king's and Privy Council's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.Beattie, 1986, p. 471 The system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the House of Commons to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed.Beattie, 1986, pp. 471‚Äì472 Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the benefit of clergy, was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.Beattie, 1986, p. 475 Transportation as a commercial transaction Joseph Lycett, an artist transported for forging bank notes, The residence of Edward Riley Esquire, Wooloomooloo, Near Sydney N. S. W., 1825, hand-coloured aquatint and etching printed in dark blue ink. Australian print in the tradition of British decorative production. Transportation became a business: merchants chose from among the prisoners on the basis of the demand for labour and their likely profits. They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as indentured servants. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk's fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation.Beattie, 1986, p. 479 These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. Maryland and Virginia enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these. The penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it;Beattie, 1986, p. 480 but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. King William's War (1688‚Äì1697) (part of the Nine Years' War) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì14) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crimeBeattie, 1986, p. 500 and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of Queen Anne (1702‚Äì14) and George I (1714‚Äì27), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.Beattie, 1986, p. 502  Transportation Act 1717  There were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (5 Anne c. 6). This allowed judges to sentence \\"clergyable\\" offenders to a workhouse or a house of correction. But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The Transportation Act was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the Whig government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.Beattie, 1986, p. 503 Non-capital convicts (clergyable felons usually destined for branding on the thumb, and petty larceny convicts usually destined for public whipping)Beattie, 2001, p. 428 were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence. The bill was introduced by William Thomson, the Solicitor General, who was \\"the architect of the transportation policy\\".Beattie, 2001, p. 429 Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was Recorder of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.Beattie, 2001, p. 426 One reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted Jonathan Forward, a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies.Beattie, 2001, p. 430 The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: he was paid ¬£3 (¬£5 in 1727) for each prisoner transported overseas. The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the Home Counties.Beattie, 1986, p. 504 The \\"Felons' Act\\" (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation.Beattie, 2001, p. 432 The Act led to significant changes: both petty and grand larceny were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge's discretion.Beattie, 1986, p. 506 In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.Beattie, 1986, p. 505 In a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused.Beattie, 2001, p. 435Beattie, 2001, p. 439 This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.Beattie, 2001, p. 447 Women and children Penal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by sex and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, burglary, and horse theft were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which benefit of clergy was not available for women until 1692.Beattie, 1986, p. 474 Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies. All these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail. Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women.Beattie, 1986, p. 483 Women were sent to the Leeward Islands, the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas.Beattie, 1986, p. 482 In 1696 Jamaica refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; Barbados similarly accepted convicts but not \\"women, children nor other infirm persons\\".Beattie, 1986, p. 481 Thanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped.Beattie, 2001, p. 444 Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them. The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community. The end of transportation The outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) halted transportation to America. Parliament claimed that \\"the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America... is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course\\"; they then passed \\"An act to authorize... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\\"Marilyn C. Baseler, \\"Asylum for Mankind\\": America, 1607-1800, p.124-127 For the ensuing decade, men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned. Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3 c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3, c. 54).Drew D. Gray, Crime, Policing and Punishment in England, 1660-1914 p.298 (2016) This resulted in a 1779 inquiry by a Parliamentary Committee on the entire subject of transportation and punishment; initially the Penitentiary Act was passed, introducing a policy of state prisons as a measure to reform the system of overcrowded prison hulks that had developed, but no prisons were ever built as a result of the act.Penitentiary Act, 1779 The Transportation, etc. Act 1784 (24 Geo. 3 c. 56)\\"An act for the effectual transportation of felons and other offenders; and to authorize the removal of prisoners in certain cases; and for other purposes therein mentioned.\\" and the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3 c. 46) also resulted to help alleviate overcrowding. Both acts empowered the Crown to appoint certain places within his dominions, or outside them, as the destination for transported criminals; the acts would move convicts around the country as needed for labour, or where they could be utilized and accommodated. The overcrowding situation and the resumption of transportation would be initially resolved by Orders in Council on 6 December 1786, by the decision to establish a penal colony in New South Wales, on land previously claimed for Britain in 1770,https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides- and-indexes/sentenced-beyond-the-seas-australias-earlys:Page:History of New South Wales from the records, Volume 1.djvu/575 but as yet not settled by Britain or any other European power. The British policy toward Australia, specifically for use as a penal colony, within their overall plans to populate and colonise the continent, would differentiate it from America, where the use of convicts was only a minor adjunct to its overall policy.Hugh Edward Egerton, A short history of British colonial policy, p.262‚Äì269 (1897) In 1787, when transportation resumed to the chosen Australian colonies, the far greater distance added to the terrible experience of exile, and it was considered more severe than the methods of imprisonment employed for the previous decade. The Transportation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3 c. 47) officially enacted the previous orders in council into law, stating \\"his Majesty hath declared and appointed... that the eastern coast of New South Wales, and the islands thereunto adjacent, should be the place or places beyond the seas to which certain felons, and other offenders, should be conveyed and transported ... or other places\\". The act also gave \\"authority to remit or shorten the time or term\\" of the sentence \\"in cases where it shall appear that such felons, or other offenders, are proper objects of the royal mercy\\"\\"An act for enabling his Majesty to authorize his governor or lieutenant governor of such places beyond the seas, to which felons and others offenders may be transported, to remit the sentences of such offenders.\\" At the beginning of the 19th century, transportation for life became the maximum penalty for several offences which had previously been punishable by death. With complaints starting in the 1830s, sentences of transportation became less common in 1840 since the system was perceived to be a failure: crime continued at high levels, people were not dissuaded from committing felonies, and the conditions of convicts in the colonies were inhumane. Although a concerted program of prison building ensued, the Short Titles Act 1896 lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century.Short Titles Act 1896 The system of criminal punishment by transportation, as it had developed over nearly 150 years, was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s, when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with penal servitude, and intended to punish. The Penal Servitude Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 99), long titled \\"An Act to substitute, in certain Cases, other Punishment in lieu of Transportation,\\" enacted that with judicial discretion, lesser felonies, those subject to transportation for less than 14 years, could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term. To provide confinement facilities, the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 121), long titled \\"An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation.\\" The Penal Servitude Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict. c. 3) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases, with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation.Penal Servitude Act 1857 While transport was greatly reduced following passage of the 1857 act, the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868. During the 80 years of its use to Australia, the number of transported convicts totaled about 162,000 men and women.Convicts and the British colonies in Australia Over time the alternative terms of imprisonment would be somewhat reduced from their terms of transportation.Transportation and Penal Servitude , Mountjoy Prison Museum =Transportation locations= Transportation to North America From the early 1600s until the American Revolution of 1776, the British colonies in North America received transported British criminals. Destinations were the island colonies of the West Indies and the mainland colonies that became the United States of America. In the 17th century transportation was carried out at the expense of the convicts or the shipowners. The Transportation Act 1717 allowed courts to sentence convicts to seven years' transportation to America. In 1720, an extension authorized payments by the Crown to merchants contracted to take the convicts to America. The Transportation Act made returning from transportation a capital offence. The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified - John Dunmore Lang has estimated 50,000, and Thomas Keneally has proposed 120,000. Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province. Many prisoners were taken in battle from Ireland or Scotland and sold into indentured servitude, usually for a number of years. The American Revolution brought transportation to the North American mainland to an end. The remaining British colonies (in what is now Canada) were regarded as unsuitable for various reasons, including the possibility that transportation might increase dissatisfaction with British rule among settlers and/or the possibility of annexation by the United States ‚Äì as well as the ease with which prisoners could escape across the border. After the termination of transportation to North America, British prisons became overcrowded, and dilapidated ships moored in various ports were pressed into service as floating gaols known as \\"hulks\\".Oxford English Dictionary online, \\"Hulk\\" n.2, sense 3b http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/89220?rskey=416nHV&result;=3&isAdvanced;=false#eid Accessed 2017/06/26 Following a 18th century disastrous experiment in transporting convicted prisoners to Cape Coast Castle (modern Ghana) and the Gor√©e (Senegal) in West Africa, British authorities turned their attention to New South Wales (in what would become Australia). From the 1820s until the 1860s, convicts were sent to Bermuda to work on the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard and other defence works, including an area still known as \\"Convict Bay\\", at St. George's town.  Transportation to Australia  This notice on a bridge in Dorset warns that damage to the bridge can be punished by transportation. In 1787, the \\"First Fleet\\" of convict ships departed from England to establish the first British settlement in Australia, as a penal colony. The fleet arrived at Botany Bay (Sydney) on 18 January 1788. Norfolk Island was a convict penal settlement from 1788‚Äì94, and again from 1824‚Äì47. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. In 1803, Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the Moreton Bay Settlement (modern Brisbane, Queensland) in 1824. The other Australian colonies were \\"free settlements\\", as non-convict colonies were known. However, the Swan River Colony (Western Australia) accepted transportation from England and Ireland in 1851, to resolve a long- standing labour shortage. Until the massive influx of immigrants during the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s, the free settlers had been outnumbered by English and Irish convicts and their descendants. However, compared to America, Australia received many more English prisoners. Transportation from Britain and Ireland officially ended in 1868, although it had become uncommon several years earlier. Transportation from colonial India In British colonial India ‚Äì including the province of British Burma (now Myanmar) and the port of Karachi (now part of Pakistan) ‚Äì opponents of British rule were transported to the Andaman Islands. A penal colony was established there in 1857 with prisoners from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (called the \\"Sepoy Mutiny\\" by the British). As the Indian independence movement swelled, so did the number of prisoners being transported. The Cellular Jail, also called KƒÅlƒÅ PƒÅnƒ´ or Kalapani (Hindi for black waters), was constructed between 1896 and 1906 as a high-security prison with 698 individual cells for solitary confinement. Surviving prisoners were repatriated in 1937. The penal settlement was abolished in 1945. An estimated 80,000 political prisoners were transported to this \\"torture machine\\" \\"in an 'experiment' that involved torture, medical tests, forced labour and, for many, death.\\" Use by France France transported convicts to Devil's Island and New Caledonia in the 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries. Devil's Island, a French penal colony in Guiana, was used for transportation from 1852 to 1953. New Caledonia became a French penal colony from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897; about 22,000 criminals and political prisoners (most notably Communards) were sent to New Caledonia. The most famous transported prisoner is probably French army officer Alfred Dreyfus, wrongly convicted of treason in a trial in 1894, held in an atmosphere of antisemitism. He was sent to Devil's Island. The case became a cause c√©l√®bre known as the Dreyfus Affair, and Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906. Use by the Soviet Union During the Second World War, the Soviet Union transported up to 1.9 million people from western republics to Siberia and the Central Asian republics of the Union. Most were persons accused of treasonous collaboration with Nazi Germany, or of Anti- Soviet rebellion. Populations targeted included Volga Germans, Chechens, and Caucasian Turkic populations. The transportations had a twofold objective - to remove potential liabilities from the warfront, and to provide human capital for the settlement and industrialization of the largely underpopulated eastern regions. The policy continued until February 1956, when Nikita Khrushchev in his speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences condemned the transportation as a violation of Leninist principles. Whilst the policy itself was rescinded, the transported populations did not begin to return to their original metropoles until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991. In popular culture =Performing arts= Penal transportation is a feature of many broadsides, a new type of folk song that developed in eighteenth- century England. A number of these transportation ballads have been collected from traditional singers. Examples include \\"Van Diemen's Land,\\" \\"The Black Velvet Band,\\" and \\"The Fields of Athenry.\\" Timberlake Wertenbaker's play Our Country's Good is set in 1780s in the first Australian penal colony. In the 1988 play, convicts and Royal Marines arrive aboard a First Fleet ship and settle New South Wales. Convicts and guards interact as they rehearse a theatre production, which the governor had suggested as an alternate form of entertainment instead of watching public hangings. In the TV show American Gods, episode 7 season 1, for one of a side story Emily Browning is playing Essie that is transported twice in her life, bringing with her in America the Leprechaun legend. =Literature= One of the key characters in Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations is an escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Pip helps him in the opening pages of the novel, and he later turns out to be Pip's secret benefactor ‚Äì the source of his \\"great expectations\\". Magwitch, who had been apprehended shortly after the young Pip had helped him, was thereafter sentenced to transportation for life to New South Wales in Australia. While so exiled, he earned the fortune that he later would use to help Pip. Further, it was Magwitch's desire to see the \\"gentleman\\" that Pip had become that motivated him to illegally return to England, which ultimately led to his arrest and death. Great Expectations was published in serial form in 1860‚Äì1861. My Transportation for Life, Indian freedom fighter Veer Savarkar's memoir of his imprisonment, is set in the British Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands. Savarkar was imprisoned there from 1911 to 1921. Franz Kafka's story \\"In der Strafkolonie\\" (\\"In the Penal Colony\\"), published in 1919, was set in an unidentified penal settlement where condemned prisoners were executed by a brutal machine. The work was later adapted for several other media, including an opera by Philip Glass. The novel Papillon tells the story of Henri Charri√®re, a French man convicted of murder in 1931 and exiled to the French Guinea penal colony on Devil's Island. A film adaptation of the book was made in 1973, starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The British author W. Somerset Maugham set several stories in the French Caribbean penal colonies. In 1935 he had stayed at Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni in French Guiana. His 1939 novel Christmas Holiday and two short stories in 1940's The Mixture as Before were set there, although he \\"ignored the brutal punishments and painted a pleasant picture of the infamous colony.\\" Penal transportation, typically to other planets, sometimes appears in works of science fiction. A classic example is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein (1966), in which convicts and political dissidents are transported to lunar colonies in order to grow food for Earth. In Heinlein's book, a sentence of lunar transportation is necessarily permanent, as the long-term physiological effects of the moon's weak surface gravity (about one-sixth that of Earth) leave \\"loonies\\" unable to return safely to Earth.

It was established in 1929 as the operative branch of the World Zionist Organization (WZO). Its mission is to \\"ensure that every Jewish person feels an unbreakable bond to one another and to Israel no matter where they live in the world, so that they can continue to play their critical role in our ongoing Jewish story.\\" It is best known as the primary organization fostering the immigration (\\"Aliyah\\") and absorption of Jews and their families from the Jewish diaspora into Israel. Since 1948 the Jewish Agency for Israel has brought 3 million immigrants to Israel, and offers them transitional housing in \\"absorption centers\\" throughout the country. The Jewish Agency played a central role in the founding and the development of the State of Israel. David Ben-Gurion served as the Chairman of its Executive Committee from 1935, and in this capacity on May 14, 1948 he proclaimed independence for the State of Israel. He became Israel's first Prime Minister. In the years before and after the founding of the state, the Jewish Agency oversaw the establishment of about 1,000 towns and villages in Mandate Palestine. It serves as the main link between Israel and Jewish communities around the world. As of 2019, the Jewish Agency operates and/or funds programs worldwide that: * Connect young Jews to Israel and their Jewish identity, such as \\"Israel experience\\" trips, Jewish summer camps and day school programs, and encounters with Israelis. * Connect young Israelis to the Jewish people and their Jewish identity, such as through sister-city style partnerships in Partnership2Gether; support for Reform, Conservative and Modern Orthodox educational programs; and the Ami-Unity initiative. * Facilitate Aliyah and immigrant absorption, such as providing pre-Aliyah services and post-Aliyah transitional housing and Hebrew lessons. * Help vulnerable populations in Israel, such as Youth Futures mentoring programs, residential Youth Villages for teens at risk, and Amigour housing for the elderly. By law, the Jewish Agency is a para-statal organization, but it does not receive core funding from the Israeli government. The Jewish Agency is funded by the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), Keren Hayesod, major Jewish communities and federations, and foundations and donors from Israel and around the world. In 2008 the Jewish Agency won the Israel Prize for its historical contribution to Israel and to the worldwide Jewish community.  Current programs  As of 2019, the Jewish Agency sponsors dozens of programs that connect Jews to Israel and to each other. The Agency organizes the programs into four different categories: 1. Connecting young Jews to Israel and their Jewish identity (Jewish and Zionist education in the Jewish diaspora), 2. Connecting young Israelis to the Jewish people and their Jewish identity, 3. Aliyah and absorption, 4. Supporting vulnerable populations in Israel. Some programs: = Connecting young Jews to Israel and their Jewish identity =  Israel experiences  The Israel Experience programs bring young Jews from around the globe to Israel to get to know the country and deepen their Jewish identities. * Taglit-Birthright Israel provides ten-day educational trips to Israel for Jews ages 18 to 26 from around the world, completely free of charge. The Jewish Agency is the largest organizational partner in the initiative and is directly involved in bringing thousands of participants on Taglit-Birthright each year, with a special focus on facilitating Taglit- Birthright experiences for participants from the United States and from the former Soviet Union (FSU).http://www.jewishagency.org/experience- israel/program/283 (Accessed 2013-12-8) * Masa Israel Journey is a public- service organization founded in 2004 by the Government of Israel's Office of the Prime Minister, together with the Jewish Agency. It includes programs in Israel for Jews aged 18‚Äì30, including study programs, service programs, and career development. Programs last from 2‚Äì12 months. In 2018 it provided scholarships to nearly 9,800 participants. Masa also performs outreach and operates alumni activities. * Israel Tech Challenge is a partnership of the Jewish Agency with the National Cyber Bureau and other partners and donors. It offers trips to Israel of varying lengths for students and young professionals (aged 18‚Äì30) with knowledge in the field of computer science and programming. The programs offer visits with Israeli hi-tech professionals and academics, along with experience or training in coding, cyber security and/or data science. *Machon Le Madrichim trains Jewish counselors from Zionist youth movements around the world in Israel, to give them tools for running educational Zionist programs in their home communities when they return. It was founded in 1946 by the World Zionist Organization. As of 2018, it had 17,000 alumni from around the world. Today the Machon trains several hundred young leaders each year. * Na'ale allows Jewish teenagers from the diaspora to study in Israel and earn a high school diploma. Students start the program in ninth or tenth grade and graduate after the twelfth grade with a full Israeli matriculation certificate (bagrut). During the first year, students follow an intensive Hebrew-language program so that they become able to speak, read and write in Hebrew. The program is fully subsidized by the Israeli government. The Na'ale scholarship includes: fully subsidized tuition, free ticket to Israel, room and board, health insurance, trips, and extra curricular activities. Na'ale offers a variety of schools all over Israel from which candidates may choose, including secular, national religious, ultra-orthodox, kibbutz, and urban boarding schools. The Jewish Agency is involved in recruitment in the former Soviet Union.  Jewish and Zionist education outside Israel  In its mission to strengthen the ties between Israel and worldwide Jewry and to promote Jewish culture and identity, the Jewish Agency sends out shlichim, or emissaries, to Jewish communities across the globe; partners with Israel and Diaspora communities, and operates and/or funds Jewish educational programs. It also supports Jewish inclusion and diversity programs. *Jewish Agency Israel Fellows are Israeli young adults who have completed army service and university study. These \\"Campus Shlichim\\" travel for two years university campuses with the goal of empowering student leadership and promoting positive engagement with Israel. According to the Jewish Agency, the aims of an Israel Fellow are to \\"create an ongoing Israel presence for Jewish students and the broader community . . . . partner with student organizations, campus study abroad offices, Jewish and Israel studies departments, local Jewish federations, Israeli consulates, and Jewish Community Centers ... [and] follow through with Taglit-Birthright trip alumni via one-on-one meetings and special programs and events to keep them active and encourage them to continue their Jewish journeys while in college.\\" In 2017-18, 92 Fellows were sent to campuses in North America, South America, and other regions.http://www.hillel.org/jewish/hillel-israel/jewish-agency-israel- fellows (Accessed 2013-12-8) *Shlichim (Jewish Agency \\"emissaries\\") are active in communal organizations, Jewish schools, community centers, synagogues and youth movements. There are also summer Shlichim who serve in Jewish summer camps. They serve as a central resource for Israel education in the local community. In the 2017-18 program year, the Jewish Agency sent 1,388 short- term emissaries to summer camps and other programs, and around 400 long-term emissaries to countries around the world (not including the Israel Fellows). *Programs for Russian-speaking Jewry: The organization has developed special outreach to Russian Jewry, because they have largely been separated from Jewish communities even after the fall of the Soviet Union. Only an estimated 20 percent of the 800,000 Jews across former Soviet states are engaged in Jewish life. And Russian Jews who have emigrated to other countries have often been separated from Jewish community life. The Agency runs programs for them (in the former Soviet Union, Germany, Austria and Israel) that fall are organized into four areas: (1) Camping, youth education, and counselor training (2) leadership training (3) visits to Israel (4) Focus on facilitation of Aliyah from the former Soviet Union and Germany. *FSU Summer and Winter Camps introduce young Russian-speaking Jews in the former Soviet Union to their Jewish heritage. Staffed by trained local counselors and Russian-speaking Israeli counselors, participants are introduced to Jewish history, Jewish customs and practices, and Israel. The Agency organizes counselors to follow up with attendees in year-round Jewish educational activities. In 2018, some 8,200 participants in the former Soviet Union attended sleepaway camps and 1,487 went to day camps. *Partnership2Gether and the Global School Twinning Network - see below. *The Emergency Assistance Fund provides for physical security improvements, such as video surveillance & CCTV, alarms, locks, gates, and reinforced walls/doors/windows, at synagogues, Jewish community centers, schools, and camps so that Jewish communal life can continue in greater safety. Jewish institutions outside Israel and North America are eligible for assistance. The 2018 allocations totaled around $1.4 million: $781,000 to institutions in Europe, $423,000 to facilities in Latin America, $82,000 to those in the former Soviet Union, and $109,000 to the Middle East. As of the end of 2018, the Fund has allocated over $11.5 million to hundreds of institutions in dozens of countries. *Jewish People Policy Institute focuses on strategic thinking and global policy planning on six issues critical to the Jewish future: geopolitics; Jewish identity; community bonds; economic assets and influence; demography; and literacy, creativity, and innovation. The institute, established by the Jewish Agency in 2002 as an independent think tank, has engaged the best minds in the areas of strategy and planning in the Jewish world. The staff examines the challenges, threats, and opportunities faced by the Jewish people and develops action-oriented policy recommendations for the government of Israel and major Jewish organizations. JPPI holds annual conferences and meetings that explore the Jewish condition. Participants have included Dennis Ross, Shimon Peres, Natan Sharansky, Malcolm Hoenlein, and Tzipi Livni. The Institute conducts meetings, publishes reports and position papers, and produces contingency plans that help the development of Jewish communities around the world. = Connecting young Israelis to the Jewish people and their Jewish identity = *Partnership 2gether (P2G, previously known as Partnership 2000) is the \\"peoplehood platform\\" that connects some 450 Jewish and Israeli communities in 46 partnerships. The program has more than 350,000 participants each year. Its goals are to \\"connect the global Jewish family, increase Jewish identity, strengthen Israeli society, create living bridges to Israel and understanding of life in the Jewish state, and increase understanding of the rich variety of religious expression and renewal around the world.\\" *The Global School Twinning Network connects schools in Israel to Jewish schools around the world, usually as part of a P2G partnership. Students share projects and communicate via Skype and Facebook. The Network includes 668 schools in 334 pairings, serving about 52,000 children and teens. (Accessed 29 August 2013)Clergy in the Conservative Judaism movement read from a Torah scroll. *Support for Religious Streams: In 2014, the Jewish Agency allocated $2.8 million to 30 educational programs in Israel under the auspices of the Reform, Conservative, and Modern Orthodox movements. Their goal is to \\"help Israelis understand the varied expressions of Judaism outside Israel, and help Jews worldwide feel that their styles of Jewish expression can find a home in Israel.\\" *Ami-Unity is a comprehensive strategy to encourage Israelis to explore the rich tapestry of Jewish life worldwide and stimulate them assume responsibility for ensuring that Israel is the national home for all Jews. Aimed at Israelis aged 7‚Äì25, Ami-Unity increases interest in the global Jewish community, exposes them to the diversity of Jewish life, cultivates feelings of being part of a larger Jewish family, instills tolerance and inclusiveness, and stresses the importance of religious pluralism. Ami-Unity is an umbrella partnership that aims to achieve long-term systemic change. To maximize impact, Ami-Unity builds cross-sector partnerships and trains educators in the partner organizations to develop and implement high-quality content to their own audiences. Those partners include bodies that provide formal education (the Ministry of Education's Division of Jewish-Israeli Culture), informal education (the Council of Youth Movements and the Council of Youth Organizations), pre-army education (the Council of Pre-Army Academies) and post-army education (the Student Union and Hillel Israel). In 2018, a total of 250,000 Israeli children, teens and young adults engaged in the resulting curricula. *Mechinot: Post-High School Service Learning programs provide Israeli 18‚Äì19-year-olds with a 6-month opportunity for Jewish study, volunteering, skill-building, and personal development in the period between their graduation from high school and their induction to the IDF. The programs introduce participants to the diversity of Israeli society and the Jewish world, and encourage a mix of self-reliance and communal responsibility; they give the high school graduates a framework in which to develop leadership abilities, and increase their chances of acceptance to a more high-level or elite army unit. This preparation can improve their career trajectory for the long-term. Participants live, work, and study together in small groups with inspiring role models. There are four clusters of such programs: (a) Derech Eretz, Alma, and Harel are pre-army mechinot, or preparatory programs, for young people from Israel's outlying regions with few educational or professional opportunities, or from socio-economically depressed neighborhoods.\\"New Jewish Agency program for high school graduates launches today\\", EJewish Philanthropy (Accessed 2013-12-8) (b) Kol Ami brings together Israeli and Diaspora Jews. The Diaspora participants stay for three months, during which the entire group explores issues of the Jewish people and Israel; the Israelis stay on for another three months of army preparation. (c) Aharai! B'Ir, whose curriculum is similar to that of Derech Eretz, but differs in that it is a day program, based in urban settings, and therefore meets the needs of those Israeli high school graduates whose families are so poor that the young people must stay at home to work or care for family members until their army inductions. (d) Post-Army Mechinot helps just-released IDF soldiers transition into civilian life and learn vocational skills. = Aliyah = The Jewish Agency still brings thousands of Jews to move to Israel each year. In 2014, The Agency helped a total of nearly 26,500 olim (immigrants) make Aliyah, the highest number in 13 years. They noted significant growth in immigration from Ukraine and France. The Agency continues to support these olim as they integrate into Israeli society. *Aliyah of Rescue is the Jewish Agency's Aliyah infrastructure that brings Jews suffering persecution or economic distress to Israel.http://jewishagency.org/aliyah/program/455 (Accessed 2013-12-8) The services include covert operations to help Jews move out of Middle Eastern and North African countries with which Israel does not have diplomatic relations. *Pre-Aliyah Services are provided by the Jewish Agency to prospective immigrants around the world. Agency shlichim, or emissaries, give guidance on issues such as education, housing, health and employment opportunities in Israel. For those who do not have an emissary nearby, The Agency provides assistance online and on the phone through its Global Service Center. Additionally, The Agency is responsible for verifying that each potential immigrant is eligible for Aliyah under Israel's Law of Return and, once eligibility is proven, for facilitating the receipt of the Aliyah visa via the local Israeli embassy or consulate. (Accessed 2013-12-8) *Absorption Centers around the country offer temporary housing for new immigrants and provide space for Hebrew instruction, preparation for life and employment in Israel, events, activities and cultural presentations. 17 of The Agency's 22 Absorption Centers cater specifically to Ethiopian olim and provide services tailored to the needs of the Ethiopian community. The other five house immigrants from around the world, primarily the FSU, South America, and the Middle East.http://jewishagency.org/aliyah/program/456 (Accessed 2013-12-8) *Ulpan: Intensive Hebrew language programs for new immigrants include five hours of immersive language instruction, five days a week, for five months. The programs are offered free of charge to all new immigrants. Ulpan instructors are certified by the Ministry of Education.http://jewishagency.org/aliyah/program/302 (Accessed 2013-12-8) *Centers for Young Adults provide ulpan classes, accommodations and a range of services to ease absorption for olim ages 18‚Äì35. These centers include the Ulpan Etzion network for college graduates and young professionals; Beit Brodetzky in Tel Aviv and Ulpan Kinneret in Tiberias, for high school graduates looking for job or army preparation; and Kibbutz Ulpan, combining Hebrew instruction with volunteer work on ten different kibbutzim.http://jewishagency.org/aliyah/program/300 (Accessed 2013-12-8) It also includes Selah, a program for high school graduates from the Former Soviet Union, and TAKA, which combines ulpan studies with pre-academic preparatory courses for immigrants headed to Israeli colleges who wish to polish their skills.http://www.jafi.org/NR/rdonlyres/8DF7FC52-2B91-49DA-941C-CE9FDB5FC277/0/TAKA_ProgramBrief_708.pdf (Accessed 2013-12-8) *Wings encompasses an array of services including practical guidance and personal mentorship for young immigrants who join the IDF as lone soldiers, far from their families.http://jafi.org/JewishAgency/English/About/Updates/Personal+Stories/Archive/2009/dec21.htm (Accessed 2013-12-8) = Supporting vulnerable populations in Israel = The Jewish Agency also helps vulnerable populations in Israel and around the world. * Youth Futures is a community-based initiative for mentoring at-risk pre-teens and adolescents. Each Youth Futures \\"mentor\\" works with 16 at-risk children over the course of three years, teaching skills for academic improvement and social integration. In 2014‚Äì15, approximately 350 trained Youth Futures staff members worked with 5,000 children and teens, plus 7,000 of their family members, in 200 schools in 35 communities in Israel. In addition to secular and traditional Jews, Youth Futures serves Arab, Bedouin, Druze, and Ultra-Orthodox communities. * Youth Villages provide safe, cost- effective boarding school settings for 850 young people ages 12 to 18 who have severe emotional, behavioral and family problems. The four Jewish Agency youth villages provide intensive, holistic services and help the youths succeed in and complete high school, and enter the Israeli army with their peers.http://www.jafi.org/NR/rdonlyres/5E7223DA-91C8-4FD0-9E12-ED1E87ABD175/0/YouthAliyahVillages_ProgramProposal_708.pdf (Accessed 2013-12-8) * Project TEN' brings together young Israelis and their Jewish peers from across the globe to work on sustainable projects in developing regions. Participants spend three months working in onsite service projects in vulnerable communities. Project TEN is a service-learning program designed to build participants' Jewish identities while they serve others. In 2016, Project TEN runs volunteer centers in Winneba, Ghana; Oaxaca, Mexico; Gondar, Ethiopia; Kibbutz Harduf, Israel; and Arad, Israel. In 2015 the program involved 200 volunteers around the world. * Young Activism includes programs that train and support young-adult Israeli volunteers, who go on to create their own social entrepreneurship projects, thus widening the circles of influence. The Young Activism programs include (a) support for Young Communities, groups of idealistic young Israelis who commit to settling long- term in Israel's high-need areas and creating programs that increase local quality of life. (b) Choosing Tomorrow, which encourages university students in Israel's outlying areas to create young communities and settle long-term in the region (c) Ketzev, which provides extra training and mentoring to some of the young communities to help them build self-sustaining \\"social entrepreneurship\\" businesses, that provide cultural or educational benefits to customers. (d) Click, which provides microgrants to individual volunteers or very small groups, to help them launch small-scale local projects. (e) The Young Adults' Hub in Arad, where dozens of Israelis and Diaspora Jews receive subsidized housing in exchange for their volunteer activities for the city. * Net@ gives high-performing teenagers an opportunity to rise above their families' socio-economic backgrounds by training them for four years in marketable computer skills, leading to certification as computer and network technicians through Cisco Systems. The program is in addition to the participants' high school course load and also increases their English comprehension skills. In 2014, around 1,100 teens participated in the program, and another 400 children participated in Net@ Junior. * Loan funds assist entrepreneurs and business owners in Israel to open or expand their businesses, through loans with highly attractive conditions as well as comprehensive business guidance. The Jewish Agency acts as a partial guarantor for the loans, to support those businesses that otherwise would have a difficult time qualifying for loans or presenting the necessary collateral for them. The various funds have different eligibility criteria, with some focusing on stimulating the economy in specific regions of Israel, and others focusing on specific populations of business owners, such as Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian-Israelis, immigrants, etc. * The Fund for Victims of Terror provides two forms of financial assistance to those who have been wounded, or had family members killed, in a terrorist attack or war against Israel. It provides immediate assistance in the 24‚Äì48 hours after the attack, and it provides subsidies for long-term rehabilitation needs. In 2014, the fund provided emergency grants to 120 families impacted by Operation Protective Edge, and more than 1 million shekels (around $250,000 according to the exchange rate at the time) to 80 families with long-term effects from Operation Pillar of Defense. * AmigourAmigour is a Jewish Agency subsidiary that provides housing for Israel's elderly. In 2014 it operated 57 facilities that housed 7,500 seniors, mainly Holocaust survivors. Additionally, it operates 13,000 public housing apartments that provide government-subsidized housing to 40,000 single-parent families, elderly, and new immigrants.  Services for Israeli Arabs and minorities  As part of its efforts to strengthen Israeli society and to support vulnerable populations in Israel, the Jewish Agency has, for many years, supported or operated programs that encourage co-existence between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs, and programs designed specifically to serve Israel's non-Jewish citizens, and they continue to create new ones.The Jewish Agency for Israel Social Activism Unit, \\"Our Work With Minorities,\\" pamphlet distributed at Board of Governors meetings October 2015. Some of the programs: The Arab city of Umm al-Fahm in northern Israel * Youth Futures, the mentorship program for middle-school students, is active in 36 locations around Israel. Some localities served by Youth Futures are Jewish, while others are mixed and, in recent years, the Jewish Agency has begun to serve children and families living in completely non-Jewish locales: East Jerusalem (100% Arab participants), Tel-Aviv Jaffa (32% of participants are Arab), Acco and Matte Asher (34%), Lod (57% Arab/Bedouin), Horfeish (100% Druze), and El Kassum (100% Bedouin). * Choosing Tomorrow, one of The Agency's \\"Young Activism\\" social entrepreneurship training programs, includes three groups of Arab university and college students (total 40 students) who are being trained to create their own social-welfare programs that will specifically benefit their local (Arab) communities. These groups are in Be'er Sheva, the Jezre'el Valley, and a group at the Alkassemy Arab College. Additionally, Choosing Tomorrow groups in the Negev work to improve medical services to the Bedouin population, by teaching Arabic to local doctors and helping them understand and connect with Bedouin culture. *Neve Midbar is a boarding school that develops leadership among teenage Bedouin boys. * Net@ is a program supported by the Jewish Agency. In its chapters in Ramle, Nazareth, Acre, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Jewish and Arab teenagers study computers together, volunteer in community computer labs together, and serve as mentors together to junior-high school participants. In addition, Net@ has all-Arab chapters in Umm Al Fahm, Yirka, and Tira. 25% of all counselors in Net@ are Israeli Arab. Druze Israeli soldiers in the \\"Herev\\" Battalion, an elite IDF Unit in the Northern Command. * Acharai Pre-Army Academy (Mechinah) includes a mixed Jewish-Druze group and a mixed Jewish-Christian group in which soon-to- be-enlisted young Israelis of both religions work together to volunteer, promote co-existence, and prepare for their IDF service. * Atidim is a national Israeli program provides scholarships and educational activities to gifted students, funded in part by the Jewish Agency. Most programs serve both Jewish and non-Jewish students, and there are some programs dedicated specifically to the Arab sector. All told, in 2014 Atidim programs included more than 2,340 non-Jewish participants, including Druze, Bedouin, Arabs and other non-Jewish Israelis. Additionally the alumni association includes hundreds of Arab, Druze, and Bedouin graduates. * Jewish Agency scholarship funds benefit Arab recipients as well as Jewish ones. * Jewish Agency loan funds often help Israeli-Arab small business owners to receive bank loans at favorable rates. The nine different funds act as guarantors. One of the funds specifically aims to assist small business owners who are Arab, ultra- Orthodox, female, Ethiopian, or immigrants.  Emergency projects  = Responses to military crises in Israel = During times of military crisis, the Jewish Agency for Israel provides a comprehensive range of services that, for the sake of efficiency and to avoid duplicating resources, are coordinated fully with the Government of Israel and other major organizations. Among them are: Respite camping for children in the line of fire: For example, During the 2006 Lebanon War, the Jewish Agency moved 50,000 children from northern Israel to 50 residential camps out of the rocket range. 12,000 children went to Jewish Agency-equipped camp-style day care held in community centers. During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict (Operation Protective Edge) the Jewish Agency arranged for children from Israeli areas in the line of fire to enjoy \\"days of respite\\" for fun activities in regions less likely to experience air raids. According to the organization's Annual Report for 2014-15, they provided 73,500 such experiences. Special services for lone soldiers on the front: During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, the Jewish Agency provided mental health intervention and financial support to 340 \\"lone soldiers,\\" IDF soldiers from overseas who do not have close family members living in Israel. Trauma therapy and other extra support for residents of absorption centers: During the 2006 Lebanon War, after a number of absorption centers were hit by rockets, the Jewish Agency moved 2,100 new immigrants to safety and distributed 2,700 bomb shelter kits. During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, they provided 2,000 hours of therapy for new immigrants. Special loan funds for small businesses in affected areas, to prevent them from going out of business and to boost the local economy during times of distress. For example, during the 2006 Lebanon War, the Jewish Agency established a micro-business loan fund in the north. Fund for the Victims of Terror: During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, for example, the Jewish Agency gave 120 grants from the Fund for the Victims of Terror to Israeli families who had suffered death or major physical injury. Scholarships for university students in affected areas: In the aftermath of the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, for example, the Jewish Agency distributed 1,300 scholarships in March 2015 to students who live , or study , from the Gaza border. = Sderot = Bomb shelter in Sderot, Israel The Jewish Agency has played an important role in supporting the residents of Sderot and the surrounding area, which has been the target of many rockets launched from Gaza. More than 12,000 children have enjoyed respite activities in the center and north of the country (during Operation Protective Edge); 300 educators have been trained to work with children living through trauma (during Operation Cast Lead); supplemental educational activities have been offered to more than 2,000 students; the S.O.S. Emergency Fund for Victims of Terror helped more than 200 people whose lives were directly affected by the Kassam attacks; 100 bomb shelters were renovated in the region during Cast Lead and 500 during Operation Protective Edge; and 500 students received scholarships (during Cast Lead) to study at Sapir College in Sderot, with more scheduled to receive scholarships as of the aftermath of Operation Protective Edge. = Israel Fires Emergency Fund = In November 2016, Israel experienced eight days of devastating fires. At least 75,000 people were evacuated from their residences, as 1,773 blazes razed over 600 homes and damaged hundreds more. The Government of Israel determined that while most were caused by weather conditions and negligence, many had been acts of terror. Within days, the Jewish Agency created the Israel Fires Emergency Fund, modeled on the Fund for Victims of Terror. Generous contributions from partners, the Jewish Federations of North America‚Äîled by the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago and CJP-Greater Boston's Jewish Federation‚Äîas well as Keren Hayesod and other donors, allowed the Jewish Agency to issue grants of $1,000 per household to victims right away. These funds provided immediate support as families faced urgent needs of food, shelter and clothing. By the end of December 2016, the Jewish Agency had delivered 618 grants across the country, with 29 additional grants in the first months of 2017.

After the establishment of the State it received its current name, The Jewish Agency for Israel. =1908‚Äì1928: Beginnings as an arm of the World Zionist Organization= The Jewish Agency began as the Palestine Office (Hebrew: ◊î◊û◊©◊®◊ì ◊î◊ê◊®◊•-◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô, HaMisrad HaEretz Yisraeli, lit. \\"Office for the Land of Israel\\"), founded in Jaffa in 1908, as the operational branch of the Zionist Organization (ZO) in Ottoman-controlled Palestine under the leadership of Arthur Ruppin.Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism, p. 153 The main tasks of the Palestine Office were to represent the Jews of Palestine in dealings with the Turkish sultan and other foreign dignitaries, to aid Jewish immigration, and to buy land for Jews to settle. Jewish immigrants of the Second Aliyah, 1912 The Palestine Office was established under the inspiration of Theodore Herzl's vision for a solution to \\"the Jewish question\\": the issue of anti- Semitism and the place of Jews in the world. In his pamphlet \\"The Jewish State,\\" Herzl envisioned the Jewish people settled as an independent nation on its own land, taking its place among the other nation-states of the world. The Palestine Office, which eventually became the Jewish Agency, was based upon Herzl's organizational ideas for how to bring a Jewish state into being.https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25282/25282-h/25282-h.htm (Accessed 14.8.2013) The influx of Jews to Palestine on the Second Aliyah (1904-1914) made the purchase of land particularly urgent. With the aid of the Jewish National Fund (JNF), the Palestine Office bought land for newcomers in two locations: Chavat Kinneret (near the Sea of Galilee), and Kibbutz Ruhama (near Sderot of today). Kibbutz Ruhama was specifically designated for Russian Jews from the Second Aliyah. Over the following decades, the Palestine Office established hundreds more moshavim and kibbutzim throughout Palestine.Gordon, Hayim. Israel Today p157 The Palestine Office continued to purchase land together with JNF (In Hebrew: Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael, KKL). With the outbreak of World War I, the anticipated disintegration of the Ottoman Empire raised hopes among Zionists for increased Jewish immigration and eventual sovereignty in Palestine.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/ww1.html (Accessed 12.8.2013) In 1918, Great Britain conquered the region and it fell under British military rule.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/ww1.html (Accessed 12.8.2013) Haim Weizmann, founder and director of the Zionist Commission (a precursor of the Jewish Agency), leader of the Zionist Organization, and first President of the State of Israel Following the promulgation of the pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration of 1917, Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the British Zionist FederationPlans Zionist Commission, The New York Times, Feb. 13, 1918 formed the Zionist Commission in March 1918 to go to Palestine and make recommendations to the British government.

The British control of the region lasted until 1948. On 25 April 1920, the Principal Allied Powers agreed at the San Remo conference to allocate the Ottoman territories to the victorious powers and assigned Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq as Mandates to Britain, with the Balfour Declaration being incorporated into the Palestine Mandate. The League of Nations formally approved these mandates in 1922.The Palestine Chronicle: Palestine Through History: A Chronology (I) Article 4 of the Mandate provided for \\"the recognition of an appropriate Jewish agency as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establishment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population of Palestine.\\"Israel Pocket Library (IPL), \\"Zionism\\". Keter, 1973. . p. 76 The ZO leaders had contributed to the drafting of the Mandate.

In 1921 Ze'ev Jabotinsky was elected to the Executive but he resigned in 1923, accusing Weizmann of not being vigorous enough with the Mandatory Government. Other issues between the Revisionists and the agency were the distribution of entry permits, Weizmann's support for the Zionist Labour Movement, and the proposal to expand the Agency. The Revisionists broke completely with Agency in 1935, but rejoined ZO in 1947.

It ran schools and hospitals, and formed a defence force, the Haganah. Chaim Weizmann was the leader of both the World Zionist Organization and the Palestine Zionist Executive until 1929. The arrangement enabled the ZO to issue entry permits to new immigrants. = Jewish Agency for Palestine 1929‚Äì1948 = Palestine immigrant certificate issued in Warsaw (16-9-1935) by the Jewish Agency.

Emphasis added. \\"The Zionist organization, so long as its organization and constitution are in the opinion of the Mandatory appropriate, shall be recognised as such agency. It shall take steps in consultation with His Britannic Majesty's Government to secure the co- operation of all Jews who are willing to assist in the establishment of the Jewish national home. the Jewish Agency for Palestine was recognized by the British in 1930, in lieu of the Zionist Organization, as the appropriate Jewish agency under the terms of the Mandate.Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry ‚Äì Chapter III, 1946 The 16th Zionist Congress determined that in the event of the future dissolution of the Agency, the Zionist Organisation would replace it as representative of the Jews for the purpose of the Mandate. There was strong opposition within the ZO when the idea of enlargement of the Board of Governors of the Jewish Agency was first raised in 1924 to include non- Zionist Jews, and the idea was accepted by the Zionist Congress only in 1927.Ganin, Zvi. An Uneasy Relationship: American Jewish Leadership and Israel, 1948‚Äì1957 p. 20. Even though non-Zionists took part in the Agency, it was still closely tied to the Zionist Organization. The President of the ZO served as the chair of the Executive Council and the Assembly of the Jewish Agency, and half of the members of the Agency's governing bodies were chosen by the ZO, ensuring a unified policy and close cooperation between the two organizations.Tessler Mark, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, p. 194Resolutions of the 16th Zionist Congress With a Summary Report of the Proceeding.

Upon the founding of the State of Israel, he left his position to become the first Prime Minister of the state. Weizmann was criticized for being too pro- British. When the 1930 White Paper was published recommending restricting Jewish immigration, his position became untenable and he resigned from the ZO and the Jewish Agency. He protested that the British had betrayed their commitment expressed in the Balfour Declaration and that he could no longer work with them.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/zionism/zionman.html (Accessed 12 August 2013) Nahum Sokolow, who had been elected to succeed Weizmann, remained in his position. Arthur Ruppin succeeded Sokolow as Chairman of the Jewish Agency in 1933 and David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Shertok joined the executive. In 1935, Ben-Gurion was elected Chairman of the Agency to succeed Ruppin.https://www.knesset.gov.il/vip/bengurion/eng/BenGurion Bioframe eng.html (Accessed 12 August 2013) In 1937 The Peel Commission published its report into the disturbances of the year before. For the first time, partition and the setting up of a Jewish State was recommended. The 1937 Zionist Congress rejected the Commission's conclusions, a majority insisting that the Balfour Declaration referred to all of Palestine and Transjordan, but the executive was authorized to continue exploring what the \\"precise terms\\" were. This decision revealed differences within the Jewish Agency, with the non-Zionists disagreeing with the decision and some calling for a conference of Jews and Arabs.Israel Pocket Library, Keter 1973, pp. 107‚Äì08. In 1947 the last non-Zionist member of the Jewish Agency, Werner Senator, resigned and while the 50 percent participation of non-Zionists in the Agency before had not worked in practice, the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organization now became de facto identical.Timeline 1947. The Jewish Agency for Israel  Organization  From 1929 to 1948, the Jewish Agency was organized into four departments: the Government Department (performing foreign relations on behalf of the Jewish community of Palestine); the Security Department; the Aliyah Department, and the Education Department. The Jewish Agency Executive included David Ben-Gurion as chairman, and Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon and Yitzhak Gruenbaum, among others. The Jewish Agency was (and is still) housed in a fortress-like building in the Rehavia neighborhood of Jerusalem. The land for the Rehavia neighborhood had been purchased in 1922 by the Palestine Land Development Corporation, and construction of the Jewish Agency headquarters was paid for by the ZO. The three-winged structure with a large open courtyard was designed by Yochanan Rattner. Along with the Jewish Agency it also houses the headquarters of the JNF and Keren Hayesod-United Israel Appeal. On March 11, 1948, a bomb planted in the courtyard of the building by Arab militants killed 13 and wounded many others.Friedman, Saul S.

Pre-state immigration and settlement 1934‚Äì1948  Throughout the years 1934‚Äì1948, in a phenomenon known as the Ha'apala (ascension), the Jewish Agency facilitated clandestine immigration beyond the British quotas. In 1938 it established HaMosad LeAliyah Bet (, lit. Institution for Immigration B), which took charge of the effort. Overall, in these years, The Agency, in partnership with other organizations, helped over 150,000 people in their attempt to enter Palestine, organizing a total of 141 voyages on 116 ships.Naor, Mordechai. Zionism: The First 120 Years (Hebrew). Zionist Library. 2002. p. 34. The potential immigrants were Jews fleeing Nazi atrocities in Europe and, after the war, refugees from DP camps who sought a home in Palestine. Most of the Ma'apilim ships (of the Ha'apala movement) were intercepted by the British, but a few thousand Jews did manage to slip past the authorities. The operation as a whole also helped to unify the long-standing Jewish community in Palestine as well as the newcomer Jewish refugees from Europe.Halamish, Aviva.

Youth Aliyah saved more than 5,000 young European Jews by bringing them to Palestine in the years preceding the Holocaust.In these years The Agency made use of the \\"tower and stockade\\" (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ï◊û◊î ◊ï◊û◊í◊ì◊ú) method to establish dozens of new Jewish settlements literally overnight, without obtaining permission from the Mandate authorities. These settlements were built on land purchased by the JNF and relied on an Ottoman law stating that any building with a full roof could not be torn down.Rotbard, Sharon. Wall and Tower ‚Äì The Mold of Israeli Adrikalut. In: Territories, KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin, 2003, p. 162. In 1933 the Jewish Agency negotiated a Ha'avara (Transfer) Agreement with Nazi Germany under which approximately 50,000 German Jews were allowed to immigrate to Palestine and retain some of their assets as German export goods.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08075.html (Accessed 6 September 2014) In 1943, the Jewish Agency's Henrietta Szold joined Recha Freier in developing the Youth Aliyah program, which between 1933 and 1948 rescued more 5,000 young Jews from Europe, brought them to Palestine, and educated them in special boarding schools.http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/19954/youth-aliyah-marks-70-years- of-rescuing-children-at-risk/ (Accessed 8 August 2013)https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/youth aliyah.html (Accessed 8 August 2013)Hacohen, Dr. Dvora, Children of the Times: Youth Aliyah 1933‚Äì1938 (Hebrew), Published by Yad Ben Zvi, Yad Vashem, and Ben Gurion University, 2012 According to Professor Dvora Hacohen, between 1933 and 2011 the Youth Aliyah movement helped over 300,000 young people make Aliyah. When World War II broke out, the Jewish Agency established a committee to aid European Jewry by finding them entry permits to Palestine, sending them food, and maintaining contact. The Agency also helped recruit 40,000 members of the Palestinian Jewish community (a full 8 percent of the Jewish population of Palestine) to be trained by the British military and aid in the Allies' struggle against the Nazis; most served in the Middle East and Africa, but some served behind enemy lines in Europe, among them a group of 32 parachutists that included Hannah Szenes. In total, 800 were killed in their efforts.http://veterans.haifa.ac.il/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=190&Itemid;=26 (accessed January 16, 2014) Survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp arriving in Palestine in 1945.

The United Nations recommended the partition of Palestine on 29 November 1947. Meanwhile, the Jewish Agency collaborated with the Jewish National Council to set up a People's Council (Mo'ezet Ha'am) and National Administration (Minhelet Ha'am).Sager, Samuel. \\"Israel's Provisional State Council and Government.\\" Middle Eastern Studies Vol 14 No 1 (Jan 1978) pp. 91‚Äì101.

Organizationally, it changed its structure: The Aliyah Department remained, as well as the Education Department (which promoted Jewish and Zionist education in the diaspora), but the Security and Government Departments were replaced by the Department of Agriculture and Settlement, and by the Israel Department (supporting activities that help vulnerable populations within Israel). The Agency's budget in 1948 was IL 32 million; its funding came from Keren Hayesod, the JNF, fund-raising drives, and loans.HaCohen, Dvora. Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and its Repercussions in the 1950s and After, Syracuse University Press, 2003. p. 99 In 1949, the Jewish Agency brought 239,000 Holocaust survivors, from DP camps in Europe and detention camps in Cyprus, to Israel.http://www.jafi.org.il/Jewish Agency/English/About/History (Accessed 12 August 2013) In the years following Israel's founding, Jews in many Arab countries suffered from violence and persecution, and fled or were driven from their homes.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/jew refugees.html (Accessed 8 August 2013) The Agency helped to airlift 49,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel on Operation Magic Carpet, and over the next few years brought hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees to Israel from Northern Africa, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. Yemenite Jews arriving in Israel through Operation Magic Carpet. Between 1948 and 1952, about 700,000 immigrants arrived in the new state. The Jewish Agency helped these immigrants acclimate to Israel and begin to build new lives. It established schools to teach them Hebrew, beginning with Ulpan Etzion in 1949. (The first student to register for Ulpan Etzion was Ephraim Kishon.London, Yaron: Du-Siach Biographi (Hebrew), Ma'ariv, Tel Aviv 1993) It also provided them with food, housing, and vocational training. For a time the construction of new housing could not keep up with demand, and many of the new immigrants were placed in temporary ma'abarot, or transit camps. In 1952 the \\"Zionist Organization-Jewish Agency for Israel Status Law\\" was passed by the Knesset formalizing the roles of each group.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/wzo.html (Accessed 12 August 2013) It was agreed that the WZO and the Jewish Agency would continue to supervise Aliyah, absorption, and settlement, while the state would handle all other matters previously dealt with by The Agency including security, education, and employment.http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/israellaws/fulltext/jewishagencystatuslaw.html (Accessed 12 August 2013) Article 4 of the Status Law stipulated that the World Zionist Organization (clarified in Article 3 as \\"also the Jewish Agency\\") is an \\"authorized agency\\" of the State, establishing its ongoing parastatal rather than purely nongovernmental status.See the full text of the law at http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/israellaws/fulltext/jewishagencystatuslaw.htm . In the early years of the state the Jewish Agency aided in the establishment of a variety of different institutions that developed the country's economic and cultural infrastructure. These included El Al, the national airline; Binyanei HaUma, the national theater and cultural center; and museums, agricultural, and land development companies.http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/About/History/#t8 (Accessed 20 January 2014) In the years after 1948, the Agency's Department of Agricultural Settlement established an additional 480 new towns and villages throughout Israel. It provided them with equipment, livestock, irrigation infrastructure, and expert guidance. By the late 1960s these towns produced 70% of Israel's total agricultural output. The Agency also focused its energies on Jews outside of Israel. The Department for Education and Culture in the Diaspora and the Department of Torah Education and Culture in the Diaspora were created to help replace the loss of centers of Jewish learning destroyed by the Holocaust. They trained Hebrew teachers; sent Israelis abroad to supplement Diaspora schools, camps, and youth organizations; and trained cantors, shochatim (ritual slaughterers) and mohelim (ritual circumcisers) in Diaspora communities.http://www.jewishagency.org/Jewish Agency/English/About/History (Accessed 12 August 2013)  Immigration and absorption, 1967‚Äì1990s  Jewish pride and euphoria following Israel's dramatic victory in the Six Day War of 1967 prompted a new wave of immigration.http://www.wzo.org.il/index.php?dir=site&page;=article&op;=item&cs;=3212&langpage;=eng&category;=3096 (Accessed 8 August 2013) In order to aid in the absorption of this influx of immigrants, the Israeli government's Ministry for Absorption was created in June 1968, taking over some aspects of absorption from The Agency and the ZO.Israel Pocket Library, Keter 1973, p. 144. Ethiopian Jews arriving in Israel from Addis Ababa, through Operation Solomon, 1991 In the 1980s, the Jewish Agency began to bring the Ethiopian Jewish Community to Israel. On Operation Moses and Operation Joshua more than 8,000 immigrants were airlifted out of Ethiopia.\\"US Completes Operation Moses\\", Doyle McManus, The Courier (LA Times) March 24, 1985 In 1991 about 14,400 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Israel in the space of 36 hours on Operation Solomon.Brinkley, Joel (May 26, 1991). \\"Ethiopian Jews and Israelis Exult as Airlift Is completed\\". The New York Times Since then, a steady trickle of immigrants have been brought to Israel from Ethiopia by the Jewish Agency. The Agency has taken charge of housing them in absorption centers, teaching them Hebrew, helping them find employment and in general easing their integration into Israeli society. In 2013 most of the \\"olim,\\" or new immigrants, in absorption centers are from Ethiopia. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, Russian and Eastern European Jews began to stream to Israel in the tens of thousands. In 1990, about 185,000 immigrants arrived from the FSU; in the following year, nearly 150,000 came; and for the rest of the decade a steady average of 60,000 immigrants from the region made their way to Israel every year.http://www.jafi.org.il/Jewish Agency/English/About/Press+Room/Aliyah+Statistics (Accessed 12 August 2013) Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, nearly a million Jews and their family members from the former Soviet Union have made Aliyah, presenting tremendous absorption challenges.Khanin, Vladimir. \\"Aliyah From the Former Soviet Union: Contribution to the National Security Balance.\\" 2010 p.6. The Jewish Agency has helped them to integrate through a variety of programs including Hebrew language instruction, placement in absorption centers, and job training.  Program expansion, 1990s‚Äì2009  In 1994, the Jewish Agency, together with the United Jewish Communities and Keren Hayesod-United Israel Appeal, established Partnership 2000. Now known as Partnership2Gether or P2G, the program connects 45 Israeli communities with over 500 Jewish communities around the globe in a \\"sister city\\"-style network. Diaspora participants travel to Israel and vice versa, and are hosted by their partner communities; schools are connected through the Global Twinning Network; global Jewish communities support loan funds helping entrepreneurs and small business owners in their partner cities; and young Jewish adults in Israel on long-term programs meet with their Israeli peers for dialogue and workshops.http://p2g.jewishagency.org/ (Accessed 12 August 2013) The Jewish Agency provides Jewish communities outside Israel a continuum of programming to \\"bring Israel\\" to local worldwide Jewish communities.They do this in part through \\"shlichim,\\" or emissaries. Shlichim are Israeli educators or cultural ambassadors, who spend an extended period of time (2 months to 5 years) abroad to \\"bring Israel\\" to the community. Shlichim are also posted at college campuses in organizations like Hillel or active in youth organizations. Participants on a Taglit-Birthright trip to Israel, 2012 Other Jewish Agency- sponsored programs that are instrumental in inspiring Jewish youth with a connection to Israel are \\"Israel Experiences\\" (educational visits to Israel) such as Taglit-Birthright Israel, a 10-day visit to Israel provided free-of- charge to young Jewish adults. The Jewish Agency is an important organizational partner in the Taglit-Birthright initiative. In 2004, the Jewish Agency and the Government of Israel together created (and continue to co-sponsor as of 2016) Masa Israel Journey, which provides stipends to young Jews between the ages of 18‚Äì30 who would like to study, volunteer, or perform internships in Israel for a period of 5‚Äì12 months. During this period, the Jewish Agency's Israel Department focused (and continues to focus) on strengthening Israel's periphery, namely the Galilee region in the north and the Negev in the South. The emergence of the high-tech industry in Israel created a significant socio-economic disparity between the center of country and the outer regions. Thus, the Jewish Agency sought (and continues to seek) to \\"lessen cultural and economic gaps.\\" For example, its Youth Futures program, founded in 2006, includes a holistic approach to dealing with at-risk youth in Israel: each child, referred to the program by a teacher or social worker, is connected to a \\"Mentor\\" who is responsible for connecting the child to resources and community services. The Jewish Agency is also a significant partner in the Net@ program offered by Cisco Systems. Program participants are Israeli high school students in socio-economically disadvantaged areas, who study the Cisco computer curriculum and earn certification as computer technicians; they also engage in volunteering and study democratic values.  Strategic plans  = 2010 = At the February 2010 Board of Governors meeting, Natan Sharansky announced a shift in the priorities of the Jewish Agency from Aliyah to strengthening Jewish identity for young adults around the world. From 1948 until 2009, the Jewish Agency was organized into departments: the Aliyah and Absorption department, which was responsible for the immigration and integration of Jews coming to Israel; the Education department, which worked to deepen the connection of Jews worldwide to Israel; and the Israel department, which focused on improving the lives of socio- economically vulnerable Israelis. (A fourth department, for Agriculture and Settlement, had been in operation starting in 1948, but had closed long before 2009.) In order to increase efficiency, the Jewish Agency, under the leadership of its new Chairman of the Executive, Natan Sharansky, decided to restructure the organization. The three main departments were reorganized into the following six program units: * Israel Experiences ‚Äì provides opportunities for young Jews from around the world to encounter Israel and meet Israelis, and for Israelis to meet them * Shlichim and Israel Fellows ‚Äì sends Israeli emissaries to Diaspora communities worldwide to strengthen Jewish identity and connection to Israel * Russian-Speaking Jewry ‚Äì runs programs for Russian- speaking Jews of all ages around the world, with a focus on Jewish education and building Jewish communal leadership * Social Activism ‚Äì aids the vulnerable in Israel and around the world, and trains young Jews and Israelis to engage in social activism * Partnerships ‚Äì oversees Partnership2Gether, connecting Jewish communities in Israel and the Diaspora to learn from each other and to build a sense of global Jewish peoplehood * Aliyah, Absorption, and Special Operations ‚Äì aids all immigrants with the Aliyah (resettlement in Israel) process and integration both before and after their arrival, and rescues Jews from areas of distress to bring them to Israel Each program unit reports directly to the Jewish Agency's Director General. Additionally, The Agency's support units ‚Äì such as human resources, marketing, and finance ‚Äì which had until 2009 existed independently for each department, were trimmed and consolidated into single units that serve the entire organization. Along with the organizational restructuring came a new focus. As the first decade of the 21st century came to a close, The Agency noted that most of global Jewry was now located in democratic, stable societies that were relatively friendly to Jewish residents. As \\"Aliyah of Rescue\\" became urgent for decreasing numbers of Jews, new challenges were arising for world Jewry, most notably, Agency leaders remarked, the need to engage young Jews in Jewish culture and to help Israeli Jews and those who live outside Israel to understand each other and feel connected to what they call the \\"global Jewish family.\\" While continuing \\"Aliyah of Rescue\\" operations, The Agency decided to focus its primary energies on fostering a strong relationship between world Jewry and Israel, and on encouraging Aliyah based on a love for the country, what it calls \\"Aliyah of Choice.\\" Its main vehicle for doing so would be to bring Jews from around the world to Israel on short- and long-term tourist programs to allow them to get to know the country and to give Israelis the opportunity to get to know them and vice versa. Parallel to these efforts, The Agency decided to increase its investment in strengthening Jewish communities around the globe. Its goals would be to grow local Jewish leadership, to strengthen Jewish identity, and to deepen the connection of communities worldwide to Israel and to the Jewish people as a whole. = 2019 = At the October 2019 Board of Governors meeting, which marked the 90th anniversary of the organization, the Board passed a decision to somewhat shift the Jewish Agency's areas of focus, in response to new critical challenges that had arisen for the Jewish people. Its \\"renewed mission\\" moving into its tenth decade focuses on three areas:\\"Jewish Agency Narrative - November 2019\\" - Document provided by the Jewish Agency for Israel's Unit for Strategy & Content # Continuing to promote Aliyah and ensure Jewish safety: continuing to facilitate both Aliyah of Rescue and Aliyah of Choice; working with other organizations and communities in a common struggle against anti-Semitism and delegitimization of Israel. # Connecting Jews worldwide to one another and to Israel: bridging the diversity of identities, interests and religious streams in the Jewish world; developing global Jewish leadership # Advocacy and impact on behalf of world Jewry in Israel: bringing the diversity of voices in the Jewish world to Israeli policy makers and Israeli society at large; helping the Israeli public understand the diversity of Jewish life while building a personal commitment to the Jewish People as a whole; developing a new paradigm for the involvement of world Jewry in Israeli society.  Governance  The Jewish Agency Executive is charged with administering the operations of the Jewish Agency, subject to the control of the Board of Governors. It has 26 members, of which 24 are chosen by the Board of Governors. The Executive is composed in the following manner: 12 members designated by WZO and 12 members designated jointly by JFNA/UIA and Keren Hayesod. In addition, the World Chairperson of Keren Hayesod and the Chairperson of the JFNA Executive are ex- officio members in the Executive. The current Chairperson of the Executive is Mr. Natan Sharansky. Over the years the Executive board has included many prominent members of Israeli society. Some of the famous Israelis who have served on the board include: M. D.

The 120 Governors play a crucial role in the governance of the Agency in overseeing budgets and operations and in recommending policy to the Agency. Members of the Board are elected to serve for a two-year term in the following manner: 60 of the members (50 percent) are designated by WZO; 36 of the members (30 percent) are designated by JFNA/UIA; 24 members (20 percent) are designated by Keren Hayesod. The Board of Governors determines policy of the Jewish Agency for Israel and manages, supervises, controls, and directs its operations and activities. The current chairperson of the Board of Governors, as of July 2014, is Mr. Charles (Chuck) Horowitz Ratner. The Assembly, which meets at least once every two years, is the supreme governing body of the Jewish Agency. It has 518 delegates who are elected in the following manner: 259 of the members (50 percent) are designated by the WZO; 155 of the members (30 percent) are designated by the Jewish Federations of North America/United Israel Appeal (JFNA/UIA); and 104 of the members (20 percent) are designated by Keren Hayesod. The Assembly is responsible for determining basic policies and goals of the Jewish Agency; receiving and reviewing reports from the Board of Governors; making recommendations on major issues; and adopting resolutions on the above. The Director General is responsible, under the direction of the Chairperson of the Executive, for the implementation of policies established by the Assembly, the Board of Governors and the Executive. In addition, he/she is responsible for all operations and administration of the Jewish Agency, including implementation of long-term strategic goals. The current Director General is Amira Ahronoviz, the first woman to hold the position.  Funding and budget  The Jewish Agency is funded by the Jewish Federations of North America, Keren Hayesod, major Jewish communities and federations, and foundations and donors from Israel and around the world. Due to the volatile U.S. dollar, the global economic crisis and the Madoff scandal, the Jewish Agency for Israel was forced to make significant cuts to its budget. The Board of Governors voted to cut $45 million in November 2008 and an additional $26 million at the February 2009 meeting. The organization's total operating budget in 2013 was US$355,833,000, and its projected operating budget for 2014 was US$369,206,000. Its operating budget for 2019 is US$379,807,000.

It tells in an exaggerated and sometimes fictionalised way of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of Corfu between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's Corfu trilogy, which also includes Birds, Beasts, and Relatives (1969) and The Garden of the Gods (1978). Durrell had already written several successful books about his trips collecting animals in the wild for zoos when he published My Family and Other Animals in 1956. Its comic exaggeration of the foibles of his family ‚Äì including his eldest brother Lawrence Durrell, who became a celebrated novelist and poet ‚Äì and his heartfelt appreciation of the natural world made it very successful. Durrell was able to found the Jersey Zoological Park (now known as the Durrell Wildlife Park) in the Channel Islands. He also became known as a novel-writer and television personality. His books helped stimulate the development of tourism in Corfu. Summary The book is an autobiographical account of five yearsThe book says five years, but there were actually four years and three months, from March 1935 to June 1939 (source: Douglas Botting). in the childhood of naturalist Gerald Durrell, age 10 at the start of the saga, of his family, pets and life during a sojourn on the island of Corfu. The book is divided into three sections, marking the three villas where the family lived on the island. Gerald is the youngest in a family consisting of their widowed mother, writer and eldest son Larry, the gun-mad Leslie, and diet-obsessed sister Margo together with Roger the dog. They are fiercely protected by their taxi-driver friend Spiro (Spiro \\"Americano\\" Hakiaopulos) and mentored by the polymath Dr. Theodore Stephanides who provides Gerald with his education in natural history. Other human characters, chiefly eccentric, include Gerald's private tutors, the artistic and literary visitors Larry invites to stay, and the local people who befriend the family. Background The book was written in 1955 in Bournemouth, where Durrell was recuperating from a severe attack of jaundice. Whereas Durrell often claimed to find writing a chore, this book was different: his first wife Jacquie recalled: \\"Never have I known Gerry work as he did then; it seemed to pour out of him\\". Durrell maintained that \\"he had started off like a good cook with three ingredients which, delicious alone, were even better in combination: namely, the spellbinding landscape of a Greek island before tourism succeeded in spoiling it for tourists; his discovery of and friendship with the wild denizens, both animal and Greek, of that island; and the eccentric conduct of all members of his family.\\" The book was an instant success. Although My Family and Other Animals is presented as autobiographical, if not completely objective, the events described are not always true. In particular, Larry lived in another part of Corfu with his first wife Nancy Durrell, whom Gerald does not mention at all. The chronology of events as they occur in the book is also inaccurate, and the reason for the Durrells' departure from Corfu (imminent outbreak of World War II) is not given; instead, it is implied that the family returned to England for the sake of Gerald's education. However, the book does succeed in preserving the impressions of ten- to fourteen-year-old Gerald extremely vividly and with a great deal of light-hearted humour. Despite the omissions and inaccuracies, Lawrence Durrell commented: \\"This is a very wicked, very funny, and I'm afraid rather truthful book ‚Äì the best argument I know for keeping thirteen-year-olds at boarding-schools and not letting them hang about the house listening in to conversations of their elders and betters\\". The book was first published by Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd in 1956 and in paperback by Penguin Books in 1959 and has remained in print ever since. Adaptations =Television and film= 1987 In 1987, the book was made into a ten-part BBC television series, My Family and Other Animals, written by Charles Wood and directed by Peter Barber-Fleming. It starred Hannah Gordon as Louisa Durrell and Brian Blessed as Spiro Amerikanos, with Darren Redmayne playing the young Gerry. Nigel Marven of the Natural History Unit, Bristol was responsible for the animals side of the production; Denis McKeown, then PhD student in Psychology University of Sussex, did the training of the famous pigeon Quasimodo in the series. The whistling for the theme tune was provided by Ken Barrie who was also the original voice of the children's television character 2005 In 2005, it was adapted by the BBC as a 90-minute film, My Family and Other Animals, starring Eugene Simon as the young Gerry, Imelda Staunton as Mrs. Durrell and Omid Djalili as Spiro. This adaptation was written by Simon Nye. 2016-2019 On 3 April 2016 ITV began running the six-part series The Durrells, also adapted by Simon Nye. Loosely based on the Corfu trilogy, it stars Keeley Hawes as Louisa Durrell and Milo Parker as Gerald Durrell. Three subsequent series of The Durrells were broadcast, in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The first series is set in 1935, the second in 1936, the third in 1937, and the fourth in 1938-39. BBC First's Dutch channel also shows The Durrells, with Dutch subtitles. =Theatre= In 2006, the Jersey Arts Centre's Theatre in Education company produced the first stage version, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the book's publication in 1956. Adapted and directed by Daniel Austin, the play premiered on 22 February 2007 at Rouge Bouillon School in St Helier.

It is operated by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. It has approximately 169,000 visitors per year; visitor numbers tend to vary with the tourist trade to Jersey. Jersey Zoo has always concentrated on rare and endangered species. It has mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, comprising over 130 species. Since 1964, the zoo has been home to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (formerly the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust). Overview Buildings at the zoo (photo September 2008) The park is located at Les Augr√®s Manor, Trinity, Jersey, north of Saint Helier. It officially opened on 26 March 1959. The park is situated in of landscaped parkland and water-gardens. The Trust has a strong commitment to looking after the Island's native wildlife, and large areas within the grounds have been designated native habitat areas. The extensive planting of flowering and fruiting trees throughout the grounds also serves to attract a plethora of wild birds and insects. Included in the former are several species of bird which used to be commonly seen in island gardens but have become increasingly scarce, including the house sparrow and song thrush. There are over 50 nest-boxes positioned around the grounds, which are used by a variety of birds including barn owls, kestrels, swallows and house martins. Other animals which are commonly seen within the grounds are the red squirrel, bank vole, and the short-toed treecreeper. Recent developments Statue of Gerald Durrell with a black-and-white ruffed lemur, April 2008 Gerald Durrell began his career capturing animals for other zoos, but thought that the facilities needed to concentrate more on animal conservation rather than mere entertainment. He tells the story of starting the zoo in his book \\"Menagerie Manor\\" and others. In January 2008 plans, known as \\"New Vision,\\" were unveiled for the future of the zoo. They were brought up to help ensure another 50 years of the trust in Jersey. These ambitious plans had an emphasis on the notion of 'TopSpots'; places where the greatest diversity of animals are found such as islands and highlands. It was budgeted that the cost of the redevelopment would be in the region of ¬£46 million over the next five years. All funds needed to be raised through public and private donations. There were nine main aspects of development with animal welfare in its mind. Most of the plan was eventually cancelled due to costs. *African Bai ‚Äî The idea was to recreate an environment mirroring the ecology of the African habitat, that the western lowland gorillas would need to adapt to, if one day it would be safe for them to be left alone in the wild. The multimillion-pound complex would include a gym and updated facilities for the gorillas. The family size could expand, or have an additional group to live alongside the current group. With the African Bai theme, it was planned to bring in new species from the region, considered animals included red river hog, African clawless otter, and guenon monkeys. *Mascarenia ‚Äî The idea was to integrate the mammals, birds and terrapins of Madagascar together in one walkthrough enclosure. It is also possible that species from Mauritius, Comores and Seychelles might be included. Surrounding the walkthrough area, which would include the bats, were enclosures which would house the lemurs, aye-ayes, narrow-striped mongoose and Malagasy giant rats. *A new visitor centre, which was designed to enhance the guests overall experience. A restaurant, and a hall of fame would become part of the experience. *Eco-lodge cabins, which would allow people to stay at Durrell for a holiday, all environmental modern experience *New Reptile and Amphibian Centre, which would allow Durrell to expand and enhance the care for species more prone to the changing environment *Redevelopment of Les Augres manor, which would allow people to stay there for holidays, by turning part into a kind of hotel *Improvements to training facilities *Improvements to the centres *Develop the Royal Pavilion into a full-time conference suite In May 2011, a new visitor centre and restaurant was officially opened by Princess Anne.The Princess Royal visits Jersey Access to the zoo is not required for access to the restaurant. A webcam service has been recently developed at Durrell Wildlife Park. Cameras have been installed in the meerkat enclosure, as well as in those of the Telfair's skinks, the Livingstone's fruit bats and in the Kirindy Forest, the home of a rare and colourful bird collection. The webcam lets viewers to those species at times when they are often inaccessible, including watching the fruit bats during the evening when they are most active. In 2015 an infant silverback gorilla named Indigo who lived at the park was chosen to be the mascot of the 2015 Island Games which were held on the island.Indigo's page on the Island Games 2015 website Exhibits =Jewels of the Forest= Opened in 2004, this exhibit houses various Asian birds such as: *Palawan peacock-pheasant *Blue-crowned laughingthrush *Red-tailed laughingthrush *White-rumped shama *Nicobar pigeon *Emerald dove *Mindanao bleeding-heart dove *Java sparrow *Pekin robin *Hooded pitta *Chestnut-backed thrush *Asian fairy-bluebird *Grey-faced liocichla =Cloud Forest= Opened in 1999, the Cloud Forest is the first enclosure at Durrell to feature mixed animals, including carnivorous species. *Andean bear *Ring-tailed coati *Black howler monkey *Brazilian tanager *Orange-bellied euphonia *Red-cowled cardinal *Silver-throated tanager =Princess Royal Pavilion= The Pavilion was opened by HRH Princess Anne in the 1970s, and serves as a conference centre, and classroom. The theatre shows films depicting the work of the trust, and also exhibits artwork. It highlights the work undertaken by the Trust around the world. The Pavilion also houses a number of species which are used for educational aspect of conservation. They include corn snakes, rainbow boas, milk snakes, New Guinea blue-tongued skinks, giant African land snails, giant millipedes, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, and Macleays spectre, a large stick insect. =The Gaherty Reptile and Amphibian Centre= The reptile house is the home of many species of reptiles and amphibians. The Gaherty Reptile and Amphibian Centre was so named because of a gift from Canadian philanthropist Geoff Gaherty. ;Reptiles *Burmese python *Radiated tortoise *Galapagos giant tortoise *Flat-backed spider tortoise *Lesser Antillean iguana *Komodo dragon *Round Island skink *Spiny turtle *Panther chameleon *Rio Fuerte beaded lizard *Lesser night gecko *Martinique's anole *Serrated casquehead iguana *European adder ;Amphibians *Strawberry poison-dart frog *Blue poison dart frog *Golden poison dart frog *Mountain chicken *Mission golden-eyed tree frog *Jersey agile frog ;Alien Invaders One issue which Durrell highlights is the effect of what happens when a non-native species is introduced to an environment and the damaging effect they can have. Case examples in the park include *Cane toad =Discovery Desert= One of the meerkats in 2012. The Discovery Desert was opened in April 2009, and was designed to give the family of meerkats more room to roam, and ensure they don't dig for freedom. Discovery desert is a mixed species exhibit featuring other animals which share the meerkat's habitat in the wild, and pose no threat to each other, such as the yellow mongoose. =Gorillas= The western lowland gorilla family has been represented at Durrell since it first opened in 1959, when they had only an infant female (thought to be male at first) gorilla named N'Pongo, who was later joined by a younger infant female gorilla named Nandi, and continue today to be one of the icons of the park. The current enclosure includes a good sized outdoor play area, and three internal rooms, two large on-show ones and a smaller off-show one. The current family of five is led by a silverback called Badongo, who was born in La Vall√©e des Singes. Badongo is the successor of Ya Kwanza. The remaining members of the family are female. From the Jambo era, are Kishka, and Kahilli, (Jambo x N'Pongo). There is also a young female named Bahasha. Kahilli has had two offspring from Ya Kwanza, a male named Mapema, and a female named Ya Pili. In 2007 the family suffered the loss of the youngest gorilla Ya Pili. The other three females did not bred with Ya Kwanza. One of the plans for the future is a new larger gorilla complex, allowing for a larger family, top rated facilities and a chance to start familiarising the species with others they would come across in the wild such as the red river hog. ;Jambo Jambo was a gorilla who was born in 1961, in the Zoo Basel, Switzerland. Jambo shot to international news stardom overnight on 31 August 1986, when five-year-old Levan Merritt fell into the gorilla enclosure and lost consciousness. Jambo stood guard over the boy when he was unconscious, placing himself between the boy and other gorillas in what ethnologists analyze as a protective gesture. He later stroked the unconscious boy. When the boy regained consciousness and started to cry, Jambo and the other gorillas retreated, and an ambulance paramedic and two keepers rescued the boy. Most of the drama was shot on home video by Brian Le Lion, and extensively photographed by other zoo visitors. The publicity on major news channels and newspapers helped the reputations of gorillas. =Red river hogs= In the past there were Red river hogs, which had been introduced to the zoo in August 2009, a transferral of two sows from Whipsnade. They had a brand new enclosure built by zoo volunteers, with a viewing platform in which to view them. The aim of the Trust was to highlight the issue of the illegal trade of bushmeat in Africa, which also affects other species such as gorillas. A breeding programme was started in 2011 with the arrival of the boar hog. However, there are no longer any hogs at the zoo. =Tamarins and marmosets= The tamarins are kept in two areas of the park, some such as the golden lion and emperor tamarins are best kept within their own enclosures. Meanwhile, others such as the black lion tamarin and the silvery marmoset are allowed to run free in a small wooded area which helps them thrive. * Silvery marmoset * Goeldi's monkey * Golden lion tamarin * Golden-headed lion tamarin * Emperor tamarin * Black lion tamarin * Pied tamarin =Central Valley= The Central Valley, expands across the centre of the park, creating a natural barrier and water resource for local species. A ¬£1 million project to redevelop the central valley, completed in 2002, has created a haven for kingfishers, bank voles, butterflies, dragonflies, and several species of waterfowl. During the valley restoration two species of locally rare orchid were encouraged, and first flowered in 2005. They are Anacamptis laxiflora and Dactylorhiza praetermissa. *Oriental small-clawed otter *Red-breasted goose *Chilean flamingo *Grey crowned crane *Swan goose *White-naped crane *Blue crane *Red-billed chough :The red-billed chough became extinct on Jersey in the nineteenth century, but they have once again returned. Durrell has joined a breeding programme and so a group are being kept at Durrell to form a captive colony, with hope to establish a free flying colony in the Trust's grounds. =Aviaries= Dotted around the Central Valley are a number of aviaries which house a selection of birds from different parts of the world. The aviaries are specialised to reflect habitat the birds should become adapted to should they be released back into the wild. They are large enough for them to fly short distances, or search the ground for food. *Northern bald ibis *Congo peafowl *Edward's pheasant *Vietnamese pheasant *Red-crested turaco *St. Lucia amazon *Bali starling *Pink pigeon *Echo parakeet *Black bulbul *Montserrat oriole *Wrinkled hornbill *White-crowned robin-chat *Indonesian teal *Tropical mockingbird =Orangutans and gibbons= In an enclosure which was revamped in the 1990s the orang utans have a large outdoor play area for them to swing around. The enclosure consists of one large main house, with two extensive external islands surrounded by a moat. The orangutan family have been in Durrell since 1968, and come from Sumatra. Durrell used to have the Bornean orangutans, until it was decided that Durrell should focus on the rarest when the redevelopment took place. There are currently seven orangutans at Durell; The dominant male is called Dagu. The three adult females are, Gina and an unrelated female called Dana. The three offspring are Mawar's eldest son Jiwa and Gina's youngest son, Jaya. Sharing the island play areas is a pair of lar gibbons, George who is black and Hazel who is light brown. *Sumatran orangutan *Lar gibbon =Macaques= Since 1964 Durrell have been working with the macaque family, in the same location, just to the side of the valley. The family have bred well, though events in Sulawesi counterbalance the work in Durrell. *Celebes crested macaque =Teal Aviary= *Madagascar teal *Meller's duck *Marbled duck *Ferruginous duck *Hottentot teal =Lemurs= Durrell is the home to six species of lemur. Five species (excluding the red-fronted brown lemurs which are solely in Kirindy Forest) are dotted around the grounds and some form the vocal point of the Madagascan exhibit Kirindy Forest. * Ring-tailed lemur * Black-and-white ruffed lemur * Red ruffed lemur * Alaotran gentle lemur * Aye-aye * Red- fronted brown lemur =Bat tunnel= A large polytunnel which has been built with used tyres was completed in spring 2011. It is the new home of the two species of bat found in Durrell. The new polytunnel is located near the organic farm and apple orchard. An additional tunnel was completed in summer 2017. It was also built using recycled materials and will provide more room for the bats to fly, in particular creating a circular flying pattern. * Rodrigues flying fox * Livingstone's fruit bat =Kirindy Forest= A major renovation project was to transform the Walled Gardens into an area marked Kirindy Forest. Based on the dry forests of Madagascar, the area is designed to showcase the work being done with the native species. There are new homes for the aye-ayes, giant jumping rats and mongooses, and a new walkthrough aviary. *Ring-tailed lemur *Red-fronted brown lemur *Aye-aye *Narrow-striped mongoose *Malagasy giant rat *Madagascar teal *Black-winged stilt *White- backed duck *White-faced whistling duck *African pygmy goose *Madagascar turtle dove *Madagascar crested ibis *Red fody *Hammerkop =Conservation successes= Proof that conservation does work, some species have returned home for continuation of programmes to reintroduce them to their own environment ;Mauritius kestrel In 1976 there were only four individuals in the wild with one female. Durrell took the risk of taking a recent clutch of eggs and had them hatched successfully ‚Äì rebuilding the species, almost from scratch. The conservation for the species has moved on to the next stage and its focus has returned to Mauritius, re-establishing the species in the community and ecosystem. ;Przewalski's horse With the newly established wild population of these species, originally extinct from the wild the zoo was part of the coalition of 'zoos' which together brought the species from the brink of extinction. Work in Jersey Outreach education in the community at the 2010 West Show Helping the local species Durrell is working closely with local wildlife groups to help with the declining populations of Jersey's sand lizard, the Jersey crapaud / common toad, and Jersey's agile frog. ;Local rare and declining plant propagation The aim is maintain the genetic diversity of the locally rare plants. Currently four species are being grown in the propagation unit. Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry), Dianthus gallicus (Jersey pink), Anogramma leptophylla (Jersey fern) and Linaria vulgaris (common toadflax). Other plant species will be propagated as seed or cutting material becomes available. As some of these plant species are severely threatened, finding specimens for propagation will be a challenge. ;Bird reintroductions In 2010 Durrell undertook a project to reintroduce birds that once populated the island's clifftops, but have long disappeared. The red-billed chough is the first focus of the programme, and they can now be found in the central valley area. There are also plans to do something similar with the yellowhammer should the project prove successful. Durrell overseas *Pygmy hog :Although no longer located in Jersey, conservation is still monitored by Durrell in Assam, India and other locations. The species is still in dire need of funding and help. During 2008 some pygmy hogs were released into the wild in Assam, early reports show good progress with the species *Blue iguana :Hitting headlines recently is some success in Grand Cayman with the blue iguana. Working alongside local authorities the iguana is being saved from extinction. It shows what can be done. In 2008 the project suffered a drawback when intruders broke into the complex and killed numerous iguanas, including juveniles and expecting females. *Madagascar pochard :Previously thought extinct, (found when looking for something else), Durrell have recently teamed up with Madagascar to help research and study the species. With scouts unable to locate more individuals, it has become a possibility that experts will have to bring the survivors back to Jersey, using expertise from the Madagascar teal and Meller's duck to help the duck get back from the brink. *Antiguan racer :In 1995 it was dubbed the world's rarest snake. More recently the species have been relocated back to Antigua on some islands where they are free from predators and pests. *Mauritius olive white-eye *White-footed tamarin *Ploughshare tortoise *Round Island day gecko *Round Island skink *Round Island boa *Mangrove finch *Mauritius fody *Giant hispaniolan galliwasp *Cuban solenodon *Floreana mockingbird *Hispaniolan hutia *Hispaniolan solenodon *Mountain coati  Completed programmes  *Partula snails *Rhinoceros iguana 1974‚Äì2010 *African crested porcupine *White-headed marmoset *Cuvier's dwarf caiman *Cottontop tamarin 1972‚Äì2009 *Parma wallaby 1959‚Äì2008 *Trinidad stream frog *Green and black poison dart frog *Standing's day gecko *Plumed basilisk *Snow leopard *Cheetah *Babirusa *Snowy owl *White-eared pheasant *Bornean orangutan *Serval *Volcano rabbit *Chimpanzee *African lion *Brazilian tapir *Leopards *Peccaries *Macaws *Porcupines *Humboldt penguin *African elephant Durrell Wildlife Camp Work began on the Durrell Wildlife CampDurrell Wildlife Camp in early 2012, which will allow the park to sell lodging and services to visitors. A wooded copse to the west of Les Augr√®s Manor has been landscaped to provide a nine-metre-square level wooden deck roughly every seven metres. These decks will house twelve geodesic dome- shaped, semi permanent tent structures and a separate shower and toilet cubicle for each. A further two platforms will house a communal structure and a pod for health and beauty treatments. Durrell Wildlife Camp is described as a 'glamorous camping' resort. The site has WiFi coverage, and each pod has a hard-wired electrical feed for running AC 240 V appliances. This sets it outside the remit of camping despite the use of tents as opposed to permanent buildings.

AIR, published six times a year since 1995, usually showcases at least one piece of scientific research being done on a strange or unexpected topic, but most of their articles concern real or fictional absurd experiments, such as a comparison of apples and oranges using infrared spectroscopy. Other features include such things as ratings of the cafeterias at scientific institutes, fake classifieds and advertisements for a medical plan called HMO-NO, and a very odd letters page. The magazine is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. AIR awards the annual science Ig Nobel Prizes, for ten achievements that \\"first make people laugh, and then make them think\\". AIR also runs the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists. It is based in Cambridge, MA.  History  AIR is not the first science parody magazine. The Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR) was founded by Alex Kohn and Harry Lipkin in 1955, but most of its editorial staff, including editor Marc Abrahams, left after the magazine was bought by publisher George Scherr in 1994. Scherr filed a number of court actions against AIR, alleging that it was deceptively similar to the Journal and that it had stolen the name \\"Ig Nobel Prize\\", but these actions were unsuccessful.  Profile  Occasional AIR articles are factual and illuminating, if a bit offbeat. For example, in 2003 researcher-documentary producer Nick T.

It was revised, expanded and later published in June 2006 as the book A History of Murphy's Law.

A caesura (, . caesuras or caesurae; Latin for \\"cutting\\"), also written c√¶sura and cesura, is a metrical pause or break in a verse where one phrase ends and another phrase begins. It may be expressed by a comma, a tick, or two lines, either slashed (//) or upright (). In time value, this break may vary between the slightest perception of silence all the way up to a full pause.Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). \\"Sibelius 5 Reference\\", p.150. Edition 5.2. \\"The comma also indicates a short silence on instruments like the piano, which can't literally breath.\\" The length of a caesura where notated is at the discretion of the conductor. Poetry In classical Greek and Latin poetry a caesura is the juncture where one word ends and the following word begins within a foot. In contrast, a word juncture at the end of a foot is called a diaeresis. Some caesurae are expected and represent a point of articulation between two phrases or clauses. All other caesurae are only potentially places of articulation. The opposite of an obligatory caesura is a bridge where word juncture is not permitted. In modern European poetry, a caesura is defined as a natural phrase end, especially when occurring in the middle of a line. A follows a stressed syllable while a follows an unstressed syllable. A caesura is also described by its position in a line of poetry: a caesura close to the beginning of a line is called an initial caesura, one in the middle of a line is medial, and one near the end of a line is terminal. Initial and terminal caesurae are rare in formal, Romance, and Neoclassical verse, which prefer medial caesurae. =Mark= In verse scansion, the modern caesura mark is a double vertical bar ‚ü®‚ü© or ‚ü®\\\\‚ü©, a variant of the single-bar ' (\\"twig\\") used as a caesura mark in medieval manuscripts.. The same mark separately developed as the virgule, the single slash used to mark line breaks in poetry. =Examples= Homer Caesurae were widely used in Greek poetry. For example, in the opening line of the Iliad: :Œº·øÜŒΩŒπŒΩ ·ºÑŒµŒπŒ¥Œµ Œ∏Œµ·Ω∞  Œ†Œ∑ŒªŒ∑œäŒ¨Œ¥Œµœâ ·ºàœáŒπŒª·øÜŒøœÇ :(\\"Sing, o goddess  the rage of Achilles, the son of Peleus.\\") This line includes a masculine caesura after Œ∏Œµ·Ω∞, a natural break that separates the line into two logical parts. Unlike the tragedians in their hexameters, Homeric lines more commonly employ feminine caesurae; this preference is observed to an even higher degree among the Alexandrian poets. Latin Caesurae were widely used in Latin poetry, for example, in the opening line of Virgil's Aeneid: :Arma virumque cano  Troiae qui primus ab oris :(Of arms and the man, I sing.  Who first from the shores of Troy...) This line uses caesura in the medial position. In dactylic hexameter, a caesura occurs any time the ending of a word does not coincide with the beginning or the end of a metrical foot; in modern prosody, however, it is only called one when the ending also coincides with an audible pause in the line. The ancient elegiac couplet form of the Greeks and Romans contained a line of dactylic hexameter followed by a line of pentameter. The pentameter often displayed a clearer caesura, as in this example from Propertius: :Cynthia prima fuit;  Cynthia finis erit. :(Cynthia was the first; Cynthia will be the last) Old English In Old English, the caesura has come to represent a pronounced pause in order to emphasize lines in Old English poetry that would otherwise be considered to be a droning, monotonous line.Bergman, Bennet. \\"Caesura.\\" LitCharts LLC, May 5, 2017. Retrieved May 17, 2018. https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and- terms/caesura. This makes the caesura arguably more important to the Old English verse than it was to Latin or Greek poetry. In Latin or Greek poetry, the caesura could be suppressed for effect in any line. In the alliterative verse that is shared by most of the oldest Germanic languages, the caesura is an ever-present and necessary part of the verse form itself. The opening line of Beowulf reads: :Hw√¶t! We Gardena  in gear-dagum, :√æeodcyninga,  √ærym gefrunon, :hu √∞a √¶√æelingas  ellen fremedon. :(Behold! The Spear-Danes in days gone by,) :(and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness,) :(We have heard of these princes' heroic campaigns.) The basic form is accentual verse, with four stresses per line separated by a caesura. Old English poetry added alliteration and other devices to this basic pattern. Middle English William Langland's Piers Ploughman: :I loked on my left half  as √æe lady me taughte :And was war of a woman  wor√æeli yclo√æed. :(I looked on my left half / as the lady me taught) :(and was aware of a woman / worthily clothed.)  Kabir (Sant Kabir Das)  One of the widely used examples of caesurae in Indian poetry was in the 'dohas' or couplet poems of Sant Kabir Das, a 15th-century poet who was central to the Bhakti movement in Hinduism. An example of his doha or couplet: Other examples Caesurae can occur in later forms of verse, where they are usually optional. The so-called ballad meter, or the common meter of the hymnodists (see also hymn), is usually thought of as a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of trimeter, but it can also be considered a line of heptameter with a fixed caesura at the fourth foot. Considering the break as a caesura in these verse forms, rather than a beginning of a new line, explains how sometimes multiple caesurae can be found in this verse form (from the ballad, Tom o' Bedlam): :From the hag and hungry goblin  that into rags would rend ye, :And the spirits that stand  by the naked man  in the Book of Moons, defend ye! In later and freer verse forms, the caesura is optional. It can, however, be used for rhetorical effect, as in Alexander Pope's line: :To err is human;  to forgive, divine. Polish Caesura is very important in Polish syllabic verse (as in French alexandrine).See Summary [in:] Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 398. Every line longer than eight syllables is divided into two half-lines.Wiktor Jaros≈Çaw Darasz, Ma≈Çy przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Krak√≥w 2003, p. 14 (In Polish). Lines composed of the same number of syllables with division in different place are considered to be completely different metrical patterns. For example, Polish alexandrine (13) is almost always divided 7+6. It has been very common in Polish poetry for last five centuries. But the metre 13(8+5) occurs only rarely and 13(6+7) can be hardly found. In Polish accentual-syllabic verse caesura is not so important but iambic tetrametre (very popular today) is usually 9(5+4).Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, o.c., p. 401. Caesura in Polish syllabic verse is almost always feminine, while in accentual-syllabic (especially iambic) verse it is often masculine: sSsSsSsS//sSsSsSsSs. There are also metrical patterns with two or three caesuras, for example 18[9(5+4)+9(5+4)].Wiktor Jaros≈Çaw Darasz, o.c., p. 73-74.  Music  In music, a caesura denotes a brief, silent pause, during which metrical time is not counted. Similar to a silent fermata, caesurae are located between notes or measures (before or over bar lines), rather than on notes or rests (as with a fermata). A fermata may be placed over a caesura to indicate a longer pause. In musical notation, a caesura is marked by double oblique lines, similar to a pair of slashes . The symbol is popularly called \\"tram-lines\\" in the UK and \\"railroad tracks\\" or \\"train tracks\\" in the US.

It was produced by Vancouver-based Mainframe Entertainment, Alliance Communications and BLT Productions. The animated series was created by Gavin Blair, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell, and John Grace, with the visuals designed by Brendan McCarthy after an initial attempt by Ian Gibson. It was one of the world's first CGI television series. The series follows the adventures of a Guardian named Bob and his companions Enzo and Dot Matrix as they work to keep the computer system of Mainframe safe from the viruses and other threats. A reimagined, live-action/CG-animated series, ReBoot: The Guardian Code, was announced in 2015, and the first ten episodes debuted on Netflix worldwide (excluding Canada) on March 30, 2018. YTV aired all twenty episodes from June 4 to July 5, 2018. Plot The series follows the adventures of a Guardian named Bob and his companions Enzo and Dot Matrix as they work to keep the computer system of Mainframe safe from the viruses known as Megabyte and Hexadecimal. The setting is in the inner world of a computer system known by its inhabitants as Mainframe. It was deliberately chosen due to technological constraints at the time, as the fictional computer world allowed for blocky looking models and mechanical animation.Hetherington, Janet L. \\"As Mainframe's technology reaches adolescence, there's a 'ReBoot' Renaissance\\". Animation Magazine #59. Vol. 11, Issue 8, September 1997. Cast and characters The main characters included: * Bob ‚Äì Guardian 452\\\\.

The latter two moved to Vancouver to develop the series there. Pearson and Blair by this time had created some of the first widely seen CGI characters, in the Dire Straits music video \\"Money for Nothing\\". However, technology was not yet advanced enough to make the show in the desired way. 3D animation tests began in earnest in 1990 and ReBoot had achieved its detailed look by 1991. Production continued on future episodes and the show aired in 1994 after enough episodes had been produced. This was a painstaking process, as no other company had at this time worked on a 3D animation project of this scale. Furthermore, the software used was new to all in the company. ReBoot was created on Silicon Graphics workstations using Softimage Creative Environment software. =Network censorship= The show's early jokes at the expense of Board of Standards and Practices (BS&P;) came from frustration encountered by the show's makers brought about by an abundance of script and editing changes that were imposed upon Mainframe before episodes were allowed to air. These changes were all aimed at making the show \\"appropriate\\" for kids, and to prevent even the slightest appearance of \\"inappropriate\\" content, imitable violence or sexuality. The character Dot was considered too sexualized by the BS&P; even though she was \\"never one to expose much cleavage\\" so the animators were forced to make her breasts less curvy and form them into a lumpy \\"monobreast\\", as lightly referred to by the staff. However, starting with season three, after severing ties with ABC, the \\"monobreasts\\" of all adult female characters were replaced with more anatomically correct versions. In another case, the word \\"hockey\\", as well as the sport itself, was cut in some countries as it was supposedly used as a vulgar slang term there. In the episode \\"Talent Night\\", one scene of Dot giving her brother Enzo \\"a sisterly kiss on the chin\\" was cut due to BS&P;'s fear of promoting incest, an insinuation which Pearson described as \\"one of the sickest things I've heard.\\" Episodes =Season 1= Each installment of the first season was a self-contained episode except for the two-part finale. When the User loads a game, a game cube drops on a random location in Mainframe, sealing it off from the rest of the system and turning it into a gamescape. Bob frequently enters the games, reboots to become a game character, and fights the User's character to save the sector. If the User wins a game, the sector the cube fell in is destroyed, and the sprites and binomes who were caught within are turned into energy-draining, worm-like parasites called nulls. When this happens, they are said to be \\"nullified\\". In the United States, the show was aired on the ABC Network and had to comply with Broadcast Standards and Practices. This was lampooned in \\"Talent Night\\", where almost every act for Enzo's party is banned by Prog Censor Emma See and the Small Town Binomes sing their hit BSnP (\\"It's fun to play/In a non-violent way\\"). =Season 2= The second season was initially as episodic as the first but later featured an extended story arc that began with the season's fifth episode, \\"Painted Windows\\". The arc revealed that Hexadecimal and Megabyte are siblings, and introduced an external threat to Mainframe: the Web, which was set up in fearful mentions in \\"High Code\\" and \\"Painted Windows\\". The sixth episode, \\"AndrAIa\\", also saw a new character in the titular AndrAIa join the cast. Creator Gavin Blair has said the move to a longer arc came from \\"shrugging off the shackles of ABC and their BS&P;\\" after being cancelled. (The last episode would reveal Megabyte's ships were called ABCs.) Glitch - Guardian Bob's keytool A creature from the Web entered Mainframe from Hexadecimal's looking glass (which was shattered by Mike the TV), bonding with her. Mainframe's nulls reacted spontaneously and covered her to form a monster dubbed Nullzilla, which was defeated and neutralized by the protectors of Mainframe. The Web creature located Megabyte, took him over and forced him to merge with Hexadecimal, forming a next-gen super-virus called Gigabyte. Gigabyte was eventually neutralized as well, but the Web creature escaped into the bowels of Mainframe, where it began stealing energy to stay alive and grow. Mouse, a mercenary and old friend of Bob's, helped to find the Web Creature, but was almost destroyed by a bomb set by her employer, Turbo. The explosion created a \\"tear\\" (an unstable energy-based anomaly) which the Web creature used to create a portal to the Web. The protectors of Mainframe had to team up with Megabyte and Hexadecimal to close the portal. An army of CPU police clashed with an invasion of creatures from the Web. In the midst of the chaos, Megabyte betrayed the alliance (with the CPUs calling the ABCs \\"treacherous dogs!\\"), crushing Bob's keytool, Glitch, and sending him into the Web portal before closing it. =Season 3= Originally, Mainframe thought they'd follow up the second season with a film. The treatment was called Terabyte Rising and was to include flashbacks to the destruction of Mainframe's Twin City. This was dropped but much of it would be used for the fourth season. The show's third season exhibited a marked improvement in modeling and animation quality due to the advancement of Mainframe Entertainment's software capabilities during the time between seasons. Subtle details, such as eyelashes and shadows, as well as generally more lifelike polygonal characters, were among several visual improvements. The show's target audience shifted to children aged 12 and older, resulting in a darker and more mature storyline. After severing ties with ABC following the second season, the show reached a greater number of households through syndication. Enzo, freshly upgraded into a Guardian candidate by Bob during the Web incursion, defends Mainframe from Megabyte and Hexadecimal, with Dot and AndrAIa at his side. When Enzo entered a game he could not win, he, AndrAIa, and Frisket changed their icons to game sprite mode and rode the game out of Mainframe. The accelerated game time resulted in Enzo and AndrAIa's aging. Subsequent episodes follow adult versions of Enzo and AndrAIa, who are now in a romantic relationship, as they travel from system to system in search of Mainframe. The older Enzo adopts the name \\"Matrix\\" (his and Dot's surname), carrying a weapon named \\"Gun\\" and Bob's damaged Glitch. The time spent in games and away from Mainframe hardened both Matrix and AndrAIa: Matrix developed a pathological hatred of viruses, and grew into a muscular, shoot- first-ask-questions-later antihero, while AndrAIa turned into a level-headed warrior. As the season progresses, Matrix and AndrAIa are reunited with Bob and the crew of the Saucy Mare and return to Mainframe, which has been almost completely destroyed by Megabyte and his forces. The group reunites with Dot and the resistance, then heads to the Principal Office for a final battle with Megabyte. Megabyte is defeated by Matrix, but not before Megabyte's handiwork causes the system to crash. All final problems in Mainframe were dealt with by The User restarting the system, setting everything right and restoring everything as it was again for the protagonists, with one major exception: younger and older Enzo now exist simultaneously, as Matrix's icon was still set to \\"Game Sprite\\" mode and was not recognized properly by the system when it rebooted, so that the system restored a copy of his younger self. =Season 4= After the end of the third season, two TV movies were produced in 2001: Daemon Rising, which addressed the problem the Guardians were facing in season three (and used much of Terabyte Rising), and My Two Bobs, which brings back a corroded and mutated Megabyte in a cliffhanger ending. The two movies, broken up into eight episodes in its U.S. run on Cartoon Network's Toonami, revealed much of Mainframe's history, including the formation of Lost Angles, Bob's arrival in the system, and the origin of Megabyte and Hexadecimal. The films end with Megabyte in control of the Principal Office, and the characters scattered and about to be hunted down. It is revealed that the nulls still possess their old sentience and intelligence: The heroes manage to put the null that was once Dot's father into a robot, enabling him to move and speak like he used to. Initial plans for the fourth season included three films broken into 12 episodes, followed by a 13th musical-special episode. Due to a change in deals and budget, the series was reduced to eight episodes.Punter, Jennie.\\"Mainframe Reboots ReBoot\\". Take One. July 2001. The following plan was to produce 30-minute episodes. These would be edited down to 21 minutes for broadcast and the extra scenes added to the film versions for DVD release. Against the writer's wishes, these scenes were cut from the scripts. After this decision was made, the eighth episode was rewritten to end on a cliffhanger. Creator Gavin Blair has publicly refused to reveal the plans for the resolution and final episodes, in case he ever got the chance to resolve the cliffhanger.Reboot Reunion Special Presentation (Part 1) video, filmed at 2012 Vancouver FanExpo In other media =Video game= Based on the TV series, a ReBoot video game was developed and published by EA for the PlayStation video game console. It was rated E for Everyone. It received a positive rating of 69.50% based on six reviews at the aggregator GameRankings.com. =Webcomic= Following its acquisition by the Rainmaker Income Fund in 2006, Mainframe Entertainment was renamed Rainmaker Animation. In 2007, Rainmaker announced plans to create a trilogy of ReBoot films with illustrator/animator Daniel Allen as the lead character designer. In conjunction with the website Zeroes2Heroes, Rainmaker announced an intention to allow fans greater access to the development of the movie plans and also to the development of a ReBoot webcomic. Fans were given the chance to submit their own art and designs, with the potential to become an artist on the project, and their feedback helped decide which of five ReBoot pitches was developed. The winning pitch was ReBoot: Arrival. Rainmaker said it would monitor feedback for the webcomic but may not use it as the basis for the company's movie plans. Four fans were chosen to work as artists on the Arrival comic. According to the pitch at the Zeroes2Heroes website, Megabyte's Hunt has developed into a Net-wide war so pervasive that even other viruses united against it. The Users have gone, spending their time in an unending massively multiplayer online game. A sentient system named Gnosis is created as a way to stop Megabyte but goes rogue and begins enslaving other systems in its attempt to gain User-like powers. To stop Gnosis and bring back the Users, two teams of heroes are assembled which will include new characters and Lens the Codemaster, who appeared in the season 2 episode \\"High Code\\". Elements of this would be dropped in the comic. The official ReBoot website was updated with a countdown, which ended on May 30, 2008, at 12:00 a.m. EST. Shortly afterwards, the site was updated with information about the first webcomic from the Arrival team and ongoing community input. The comic, renamed Code of Honor, was viewable after creating an account or using an existing Zeros 2 Heroes account. A new countdown appeared on the official ReBoot website on August 18, 2008 to launch the second installment of the webcomic. Updates to the comic were posted on Mondays, with two pages each update. The comic ended shortly after Christmas, and surveys were added to the site. The Art of ReBoot, a 104-page hardcover artbook, was published in February 2007 by Beach Studios; it contained copies of various rare and never-before-seen conceptual artwork, with the work of Brendan McCarthy being a major focus. On July 24, 2009, the ReBoot website was upgraded into the official ReBoot fansite, with the webcomic was freely available. The website was set to shut down for July 30, 2012 after several years of inactivity; an announcement on July 27, 2012 revealed that the site would remain open. Synopsis The first Paradigms Lost issue opens with the aftermath of the Hunt: Mainframe is devastated and overrun with Zombinomes, the User is missing, and the entire population is being evacuated to the Super Computer. Worse still, the weakened Guardian Collective is facing viral attacks and uprisings across the entire Net. Turbo blames Bob for this, saying that his views on viruses became widespread and left them weakened. Enzo Matrix, meanwhile, is a star pupil in the Guardian Academy. The viral threat is ended when the Codemasters pledge their help, offering a firmware named Gnosis. Gnosis is uploaded to every System on the Net, erasing all viruses and ending the crisis. The first issue ends with the Codemasters' Guildmaster activating a \\"Phase Two\\" for the implemented Gnosis. The second and third issues had the heroes, now joined by Lens, try to stop the Codemasters from using Gnosis to access the Code itself, allowing the Guildmaster total control. However, Gnosis swiftly decides that it can complete its task better with the Guildmaster deleted, and following that it eliminates the Guardians. Mainframe and 36 other systems are enslaved as power sources for its mission. Dot tries to carry out rebel action in Mainframe, Bob and Lens retreat to the bowels of the Super-Computer to hide, and Enzo is captured and discovers Megabyte (his code retained by Gnosis) is a key Gnosis advisor. Bob is recruited by Exidy, an entity that is the source of the Code and trapped by Gnosis in the Net; intent on restoring balance and stability, she gives Bob the ability to wield the Code. While the main heroes link up and Bob is sent to take on Gnosis directly, Enzo verbally battles with Megabyte for influence over Gnosis, pointing out that it could accomplish its task quicker if it was cooperative and asked for assistance. When Gnosis comes around to this, Bob decides to allow the weapon to live and reprograms it, and has it restore the Net to the way it was. That done, he frees Exidy and returns home. =Unmade spin-offs= Television A spinoff called Binomes was planned towards the end of 2004, featuring a family of Binomes who lived on a \\"chip farm\\". The series would have been composed of fifty-two 11-minute episodes and aimed at a pre-school audience, but nothing of this project came to pass after the initial announcement. Film trilogy In June 2008, Rainmaker Animation announced plans for a trilogy of theatrical ReBoot films, with the first to be written by Jon Cooksey. By August 2008, however, he was no longer involved with the project. A teaser for the film was released on October 5, 2009, on Rainmaker's official site, and in March 2011, Rainmaker said a ReBoot film remained in the company's plans. In a podcast released April 8, 2013, Rainmaker president and executive producer Michael Hefferon said the film trilogy was no longer being worked on. =ReBoot: The Guardian Code= A reimagining of ReBoot blending live-action and computer animation, ReBoot: The Guardian Code, debuted in 2018 on YTV and Netflix. It features four high schoolers who physically enter cyberspace as \\"next- generation Guardians\\" to combat Megabyte and the human hacker who now controls him. Distribution =Television broadcasts= ReBoot was first broadcast on Saturday mornings in Canada on YTV and in the United States in 1994 by ABC. It was canceled on ABC after The Walt Disney Company purchased the network. Episodes continued to air in Canada. Some episodes from the first and second seasons could still be seen in the U.S. when Claster Television distributed them during the 1996-1997 season. It was on Thursday's \\"The Power Block\\". It would be a year before new episodes aired on YTV due to Mainframe's involvement in Beast Wars: Transformers (known as Beasties in Canada) and Shadow Raiders, and the third season aired only on YTV at the time. In April 1999, years after Canadian audiences saw the third season, U.S. audiences saw the episodes on Cartoon Network. Production on other series delayed the fourth season of ReBoot, the eight episodes of which eventually were released in the U.S. as two 90-minute direct-to-DVD features that ended on a cliffhanger season finale. Series creators Blair and Pearson resigned from Mainframe Entertainment in 2004 to form their own independent studio, The Shop. The show also aired in the United Kingdom from 4 January 1995 until 9 April 1998, on the ITV network as part of their CITV programming block. When it came to the third season, Meridian only purchased the broadcasting rights for the first 10 episodes of the season and on 17 July 1997, CITV started airing season 3 before anywhere else in the world; however, this run came to a halt in August after the sixth episode, \\"Where No Sprite Has Gone Before\\". On 12 February 1998, CITV repeated the series from the season 2 episode \\"Trust No One\\" before going into the episodes that had yet to be aired at that point. When \\"To Mend and Defend\\" should have aired, the episode \\"Firewall\\" was substituted since \\"To Mend And Defend\\" received 19 complaints from viewers who claimed \\"the violence was unacceptable and the characters were inappropriate in a children's programme shown at this time\\" on its original airing in July 1997. It was not specified, however, why the following episode, \\"Between a Raccoon and a Hard Place\\", was omitted from the run. The run was abruptly stopped without warning after the episode \\"Return of the Crimson Binome\\", and the remainder of the series wasn't aired due to ITV deeming the content unsuitable. After the abrupt end of the run, several UK fans contacted ITV in order to persuade them to air the remaining episodes, and ITV replied saying that the show's low ratings made them wary of acquiring the broadcast rights to the remaining episodes. The first season was shown in the Republic of Ireland on RTE Two in 1995.RTE Guide, 14‚Äì20 January 1995 edition In Germany it debuted on Kinderkanal in 1997. =Home media= In Canada, four VHS tapes were released in 1995 with individual episodes from the first season through Polygram Video. Each release contained a single episode: \\"Medusa Bug\\", \\"Wizards, Warriors, and a Word from Our Sponsor\\", \\"The Great Brain Robbery\\", and \\"Talent Night\\". The UK received two VHS releases, but with two episodes each: Volume 1 contained \\"The Tearing\\" and \\"Racing the Clock\\", while Volume two had \\"The Quick and the Fed\\" and \\"Medusa Bug\\". The second season was never released, even though Polygram retained the rights to publish the episodes on home video with their deal for the first season. Despite this, in 2000 Mainframe struck a deal with A.D. Vision to release the third season on DVD. Shout! Factory acquired the rights to the show in October 2010 and released seasons 1 and 2 as a standalone title on March 1, 2011. On the same date, the complete series went on sale as a box set (dubbed \\"ReBoot: The Definitive Mainframe Collection\\") exclusively through Shout‚Äôs official online store months before the set was scheduled to be on retail shelves.ReBoot: The Definitive Mainframe Edition\\" Retrieved on: 03-08-2011 Season 3 and 4 were released on June 28, 2011, as well as a general retail release of the complete series set. Awards ReBoot has been the recipient of several awards. The show received Gemini Awards for Best Animated Program Series for three straight years between 1995 and 1997, as well as a 1996 Outstanding Technical Achievement Award. Other honors include the 1995 Award of Excellence and Best Animated Program from the Alliance for Children and Television and a Prix Aurora Award in 1996.Weatherford, Margaret, \\"Keyframing to Fame\\", IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 18(4): 4-5 (1998) Other Gemini Award nominations include \\"Best Children's or Youth Program or Series\\" in 1998, and \\"Best Sound ‚Äì Comedy, Variety, or Performing Arts Program or Series\\" for My Two Bobs and \\"Best Sound ‚Äì Dramatic Program\\" for Daemon Rising, both in 2002.

Christian G. Wolff (born March 8, 1934) is an American composer of experimental classical music. Biography Wolff was born in Nice, France, to the German literary publishers Helen and Kurt Wolff, who had published works by Franz Kafka, Robert Musil, and Walter Benjamin. After relocating to the U.S. in 1941, they helped to found Pantheon Books with other European intellectuals who had fled Europe during the rise of fascism. The Wolffs published a series of notable English translations of European literature, mostly, as well as an edition of the I Ching that came to greatly impress John Cage after Wolff had given him a copy. Wolff became an American citizen in 1946. When he was sixteen (in 1950) his piano teacher Grete Sultan sent him for lessons in composition to the new music composer John Cage. Wolff soon became a close associate of Cage and his artistic circle which was part of the New York School and included the fellow composers Earle Brown and Morton Feldman, the pianist David Tudor, and the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. Cage relates several anecdotes about Wolff in his one-minute Indeterminacy pieces.Cage, John. Indeterminacy [double LP]. New York, Folkways Records, 1959. Wolff is mentioned in piece numbers 4, 8, 9 and 14, as well as numbers 91 and 155, which were published after Folkways' original release. Almost completely self-taught as composer, Wolff studied music under Sultan and Cage. Later Wolff studied classics at Harvard University (BA, PhD) and became an expert on Euripides. Wolff taught Classics at Harvard until 1970; thereafter he taught classics, comparative literature, and music at Dartmouth College. After nine years, he became Strauss Professor of Music there. He retired from teaching at Dartmouth in 1999. In 2004, he received an honorary degree from the California Institute of the Arts. He was also awarded the Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award (1996). Wolff is married and has four children. Music Wolff's early compositional work included a lot of silence and was based initially on complicated rhythmic schema, and later on a system of aural cues. He innovated unique notational methods in his early scores and found creative ways of dealing with improvisation in his music. During the 1960s he developed associations with the composers Frederic Rzewski and Cornelius Cardew who spurred each other on in their respective explorations of experimental composition techniques and musical improvisation, and then, from the early 1970s, in their attempts to engage with political matters in their music. For Wolff this often involved the use of music and texts associated with protest and political movements such as the Wobblies. His later pieces, such as the sequence of pieces Exercises (1973-), offer some freedom to the performers. Some works, such as Changing the System (1973), Braverman Music (1978, after Harry Braverman), and the series of pieces Peace March (1983-2005) have an explicit political dimension, in that they respond to contemporary world events and express political ideals. Wolff collaborated with Merce Cunningham for many years and developed a style which is more common now, but was revolutionary when they began working together in the 1950s ‚Äì a style where music and dance occur simultaneously, yet somewhat independently of one another. Wolff stated, of any influence or affect, the greatest influence on his music over the years was the choreography of Cunningham. Wolff recently said of his work that it is motivated by his desire \\"to turn the making of music into a collaborative and transforming activity (performer into composer into listener into composer into performer, etc.), the cooperative character of the activity to the exact source of the music. To stir up, through the production of the music, a sense of social conditions in which we live and of how these might be changed.\\" Wolff's music reached a new audience when Sonic Youth's \\"Goodbye, 20th Century\\" featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, and Christian Wolff played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others, as well as Wolff himself.

This region on the Pacific Coast is the most famous of several that have sought to adopt the name of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. Jefferson, who sent the Lewis and Clark expedition into the Pacific Northwest in 1803, envisioned the establishment of an independent nation in the western portion of North America that he dubbed the \\"Republic of the Pacific\\"; hence, the association of his name with regional autonomy. The independence movement, rather than statehood, is known as Cascadia. This region encompasses most of Northern California's land but does not include San Francisco or other Bay Area counties that account for the majority of Northern California's population. The name \\"Jefferson\\" has also been used for other proposed states: the name was proposed in the 19th century for Jefferson Territory (roughly modern Colorado), as well as in 1915 in a bill in the Texas Legislature for a proposed state that would be created from the Texas Panhandle region.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mqd01 If the proposal were ever approved, the new state's capital city would have to be determined by a constitutional convention. Yreka, California, was named the provisional capital in the original 1941 proposal,Peter Laufer, The Elusive State of Jefferson: A Journey Through the 51st State. TwoDot, 2013. . although Port Orford, Oregon, had also been up for consideration. Some supporters of the more recent revival have also identified Redding, California, as a potential capital, even though Redding is not included in all versions of the proposal and its City Council voted in 2013 to reject participation in the movement.\\"Redding City Council rejects \\"State of Jefferson\\" proposal\\". KRCR- TV, October 2, 2013. 20th century A pavilion near Yreka, California In October 1941, the Mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, said that the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath should join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. He was motivated by the belief that these heavily rural areas were underrepresented in state government, which tended to cater to more populous areas.Michael J. Trinklein (2010). Lost States: True Stories of Texlahoma, Transylvania, and Other States That Never Made It. Quirk Books. On November 27, 1941, a group of young men gained national media attention when, brandishing hunting rifles for dramatic effect, they stopped traffic on U.S. Route 99 south of Yreka, the county seat of Siskiyou County, and handed out copies of a Proclamation of Independence, stating that the State of Jefferson was in \\"patriotic rebellion against the States of California and Oregon\\" and would continue to \\"secede every Thursday until further notice.\\" The state split movement ended quickly, though not before Del Norte County District Attorney John Leon Childs (1863‚Äì1953) of Crescent City was inaugurated as the Governor of the State of Jefferson on December 4, 1941. The first blow was the death of Mayor Gable on December 2, followed by the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7. Those in favor of splitting the state focused their efforts on the war effort, which crippled the movement. San Francisco Chronicle journalist Stanton Delaplane won the 1942 Pulitzer Prize for Reporting for his articles on the State of Jefferson. In 1989, KSOR, the National Public Radio member station based at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, near Medford, rebranded itself as Jefferson Public Radio. It had built a massive network of low-powered translators earlier in the 1980s. By the time KSOR began building full-power stations later in the decade, it realized that the combined footprint of its translator network was roughly coextensive with the original State of Jefferson. It thus felt \\"Jefferson Public Radio\\" was an appropriate name when it decided to rebrand itself as a network. In 1992, California State Assemblyman Stan Statham placed an advisory vote in 31 counties asking if the state should be split into two. All of the proposed Jefferson counties voted in favor of the split (except Humboldt County which did not have the issue on the ballot). Based on these results, Statham introduced legislation in California in an attempt to split the state, but the bill died in committee. In the late 1990s, the movement for statehood was promoted by a group called the State of Jefferson Citizens Committee, which was originally formed in 1941. Two of the members, Brian Helsaple and Brian Petersen, gathered an extensive collection, including both verbal and written accounts mostly surrounding the 1941 movement. They published a book, \\"Jefferson Saga,\\" in 2000. This, along with revealing the lack of representation and over- regulations, fanned the flame. 21st century Jefferson is commemorated by the State of Jefferson Scenic Byway between Yreka and O'Brien, Oregon, which runs along State Route 96 and U.S. Forest Service Primary Route 48. Near the California ‚Äì Oregon border, a turnout provides scenic views of the Klamath River valley and three informative display signs about the republic. The region retains this identity reinforced by institutions such as Jefferson Public Radio. As of the 2010 Census, if the Jefferson counties were a state (original 1941 counties), the state's population would be 457,859: smaller than any state at the time. Approximately 82% of those residents live in Oregon. Its land area would be ‚Äì a little smaller than West Virginia. The area was almost evenly divided between Oregon and California. Its population density would be ‚Äì a little more than Idaho.Using the 2010 Census QuickFacts figures for each of the following counties: Curry, Josephine, Jackson, Klamath, Del Norte, Siskiyou, Modoc. (See \\"Download the Database \\" for an explanation of this data set.) With the addition of the more modern Jefferson movement (Coos and Douglas and Lake Counties in Oregon, and Humboldt, Trinity, Shasta, Lassen, Mendocino, Lake, Tehama, Plumas, Glenn, Butte, Colusa, Sierra, Sutter, Yuba, Nevada, Placer and El Dorado Counties in California), the population as of the 2010 Census would be 2,313,958, making it the 36th most populous state in the United States. =Counties intending to leave California= On September 3, 2013, the Siskiyou County, California Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 in favor of withdrawal from California to form a proposed state named Jefferson.Longoria, Sean, Siskiyou supervisors support withdrawal from California , Redding Record Searchlight, September 4, 2013, accessed September 4, 2013.Mather, Kate, Siskiyou County votes to pursue secession from California, Los Angeles Times, September 4, 2013, accessed September 4, 2013Northern California County Board Votes For Secession From State, CBS, San Francisco, September 4, 2013. The proposal was joined by the Modoc County Board of Supervisors (September 24) and Glenn County Board of Supervisors (January 21, 2014). On April 15, 2014 Yuba County Supervisors joined the State of Jefferson movement to separate from California and create a new U.S. state. On July 15, 2014 the Tehama County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to adopt a resolution supporting the declaration of withdrawal from California based on an advisory vote taken on June 6, 2014 where the public voted 56% to 44% in favor of splitting the state. On July 22, 2014 the Board of Supervisors of Sutter County unanimously adopted a resolution supporting a declaration and petition to the Legislature to withdraw from California to redress a lack of representation. On March 3, 2015, Lake County supervisors voted 3 to 2 to submit the question of secession to voters and on March 17, Lassen County supervisors made a similar declaration that also has the voters deciding in 2016. The Jefferson Declaration Committee is reportedly aiming to get at least 12 counties in support. On October 24, 2014, Modoc and Siskiyou Counties delivered their declarations for independence from the state of California to the California Secretary of State's office. On January 15, 2015, three more counties, Glenn, Tehama, and Yuba, submitted their official declarations as well. The 2013 revival was based almost entirely in California.\\"Secession: Realistic hope or illusion?\\". Medford Mail Tribune, September 8, 2013. It includes all major parts of California north of 39¬∞. Although some individual residents in Oregon have lobbied for the movement, no county government in that state has endorsed the proposal to date.\\"California secession vote fails in two counties bordering Oregon; passes in one other county\\". The Oregonian, June 4, 2014. As of January 6, 2016, 21 northern California counties have sent a declaration or have approved to send a declaration to the State of California with their intent of leaving the state and forming the State of Jefferson. The population of the 21 California counties was 1,747,626 as of the 2010 U.S. Census, which would be 39th most populous state in the Union. =2016 presidential election= 2016 presidential election results, showing a strong Republican presence in the proposed State of Jefferson After the 2016 presidential election, it was noted that most of the rural California counties which would belong to the State of Jefferson were won in a landslide by Republican nominee Donald Trump, whereas Democrat Hillary Clinton enjoyed an unprecedented level of support in the rest of California, indicating a growing demographic and political divide between the proposed State of Jefferson and the rest of California. While Clinton beat Trump by almost 80 points in San Francisco, he led her by more than 50 points in Lassen County. The election of Trump led to calls for a secession of California and a similar proposal in Oregon, where Clinton won the popular vote while Trump captured the majority of counties. With the election of President Donald Trump, some who are considering joining the modern State of Jefferson or are observing the movement have stated that if California secedes, the movement's supporting counties could appeal directly to the United States Congress for statehood, similar to how West Virginia was formed, claiming California would be in insurrection and petitioning to rejoin the Union as an independent state. On May 8, 2017, the State of Jefferson as \\"Citizens for Fair Representation\\" filed a lawsuit against the California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. The suit alleges that California's 1862 law limiting Senators to no more than 40, and Assembly Members to no more than 80, creates an unconstitutional imbalance of representation that precludes effective \\"self-governance\\" as protected by the 14th Amendment. The desired result of suing California, for lack of representation and dilution of vote, is better representation across all of California, and ultimately an independent State of Jefferson. The case was dismissed by the lower court and appealed to the Ninth Circuit. https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/344/cfr-v-alex-padilla/  Flag and seal Jefferson state flag The field of the flag is green, and the charge is the Seal of the State of Jefferson: a gold mining pan with the words \\"The Great Seal Of State Of Jefferson\\" engraved into the lip, and two Xs askew of each other.The real history and meaning behind the State of Jefferson, retreat.com.

Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard (; ; ; 10 August 1924 ‚Äì 21 April 1998) was a French philosopher, sociologist, and literary theorist. His interdisciplinary discourse spans such topics as epistemology and communication, the human body, modern art and postmodern art, literature and critical theory, music, film, time and memory, space, the city and landscape, the sublime, and the relation between aesthetics and politics. He is best known for his articulation of postmodernism after the late 1970s and the analysis of the impact of postmodernity on the human condition. Lyotard was a key personality in contemporary Continental philosophy and author of 26 books and many articles. He was a director of the International College of Philosophy which was founded by Jacques Derrida, Fran√ßois Ch√¢telet, Jean-Pierre Faye and Dominique Lecourt. Biography = Early life, educational background, and family = Jean Fran√ßois Lyotard was born on August 10, 1924 in Vincennes, France to Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a sales representative, and Madeleine Cavalli. He went to primary school at the Paris Lyc√©e Buffon and Louis-le-Grand. As a child, Lyotard had many aspirations: to be an artist, a historian, a Dominican friar, and a writer. He later gave up the dream of becoming a writer when he finished writing an unsuccessful fictional novel at the age of 15.Sica, Alan. 2005, \\"Jean Francois Lyotard.\\" Social thought: from the Enlightenment to the present. Boston: Pearson/Allyn and Bacon, 682. Ultimately, Lyotard describes the realization that he would not become any of these occupations as \\"fate\\" in his intellectual biography called Peregrinations, published in 1988. He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in the late 1940s. His 1947 DES thesis, Indifference as an Ethical Concept (L'indiff√©rence comme notion √©thique), analyzed forms of indifference and detachment in Zen Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Epicureanism.Jacques Derrida, The Work of Mourning, ed. Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 211. In 1950, Lyotard took up a position teaching philosophy in Constantine in French Algeria but returned to mainland France in 1952 to teach at the Prytan√©e military academy in La Fl√®che, where he wrote a short work on Phenomenology, published in 1954. Lyotard moved to Paris in 1959 to teach at the Sorbonne: introductory lectures from this time (1964) have been posthumously published under the title Why Philosophize? Having moved to teach at the new campus of Nanterre in 1966, Lyotard participated in the events following March 22 and the tumult of May 1968. In 1971, Lyotard earned a State doctorate with his dissertation Discours, figure under Mikel Dufrenne‚Äîthe work was published the same year.Jacques Derrida, The Work of Mourning, ed. Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 211. Lyotard joined the Philosophy department of the experimental University at Vincennes, later Paris 8, together with Gilles Deleuze, in the academic year 1970-71; it remained his academic home in France until 1987. He married his first wife, Andr√©e May, in 1948 with whom he had two children, Corinne and Laurence, and later married for a second time in 1993 to Dolores Djidzek, the mother of his son David (born in 1986).Jacques Derrida, The Work of Mourning, ed. Pascale- Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 211-213. =Political life= In 1954, Lyotard became a member of Socialisme ou Barbarie (\\"Socialism or Barbarism\\"), a French political organisation formed in 1948 around the inadequacy of the Trotskyist analysis to explain the new forms of domination in the Soviet Union. Socialisme ou Barbarie had an objective to conduct a critique of Marxism from within during the Algerian war of liberation. His writings in this period are mostly concerned with ultra- left politics, with a focus on the Algerian situation‚Äîwhich he witnessed first-hand while teaching philosophy in Constantine. He wrote optimistic essays of hope and encouragement to the Algerians, which were reproduced in Political Writings. Lyotard hoped to encourage an Algerian fight for independence from France, and a social revolution. Following disputes with Cornelius Castoriadis in 1964, Lyotard left Socialisme ou Barbarie for the newly formed splinter group Pouvoir Ouvrier (\\"Worker Power\\"), from which he resigned in turn in 1966. Cf. http://www.iep.utm.edu/lyotard/. Although Lyotard played an active part in the May 1968 uprisings, he distanced himself from revolutionary Marxism with his 1974 book Libidinal Economy.Geoffrey Bennington, Lyotard: Writing the Event, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988, p. 1. He distanced himself from Marxism because he felt that Marxism had a rigid structuralist approach and they were imposing 'systematization of desires' through strong emphasis on industrial production as the ground culture.Mann, Doug. Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory. Oxford University Press. 2008. pp. 257‚Äì258. =Academic career= Lyotard taught at the , Algeria from 1950 to 1952. In 1972, Lyotard began teaching at the University of Paris VIII; he taught there until 1987 when he became Professor Emeritus. During his last eleven years he lectured outside France, notably as a Professor of Critical Theory at the University of California, Irvine and as visiting professor at universities around the world. These included: Johns Hopkins University, University of California, Berkeley, Yale University, Stony Brook University and the University of California, San Diego in the U.S., the Universit√© de Montr√©al in Quebec (Canada), and the University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. He was also a founding director and council member of the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie, Paris. Before his death, he split his time between Paris and Atlanta, where he taught at Emory University as the Woodruff Professor of Philosophy and French. Work Lyotard's work is characterised by a persistent opposition to universals, m√©tar√©cits (meta-narratives), and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the 'universalist' claims of the Enlightenment, and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims. In his writings of the early 1970s, he rejects what he regards as theological underpinnings of both Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud: \\"In Freud, it is judaical, critical sombre (forgetful of the political); in Marx it is catholic. Hegelian, reconciliatory (...) in the one and in the other the relationship of the economic with meaning is blocked in the category of representation (...) Here a politics, there a therapeutics, in both cases a laical theology, on top of the arbitrariness and the roaming of forces\\". Consequently, he rejected Theodor W. Adorno's negative dialectics because he viewed them as seeking a \\"therapeutic resolution in the framework of a religion, here the religion of history.\\" In Lyotard's \\"libidinal economics\\" he aimed at \\"discovering and describing different social modes of investment of libidinal intensities\\". =The Postmodern Condition= Lyotard is a skeptic for modern cultural thought. According to his 1979 The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, the impact of the postmodern condition was to provoke skepticism about universalizing theories. Lyotard argues that we have outgrown our needs for metanarratives () due to the advancement of techniques and technologies since World War II. He argues against the possibility of justifying the narratives that bring together disciplines and social practices, such as science and culture; \\"the narratives we tell to justify a single set of laws and stakes are inherently unjust.\\"Williams, James. 2002. \\"Jean-Francois Lyotard\\", pp. 210‚Äì214, in Key Contemporary Social Theorists by Anthony Elliott and Larry Ray. Oxford, Blackwell Publishers. A loss of faith in metanarratives has an effect on how we view science, art, and literature. Little narratives have now become the appropriate way for explaining social transformations and political problems. Lyotard argues that this is the driving force behind postmodern science. As metanarratives fade, science suffers a loss of faith in its search for truth, and therefore must find other ways of legitimating its efforts. Connected to this scientific legitimacy is the growing dominance for information machines. Lyotard argues that one day, in order for knowledge to be considered useful, it will have to be converted into computerized data. Years later, this led him into writing his book The Inhuman, published in 1988, in which he illustrates a world where technology has taken over.Parker, Noel and Sim, Stuart. 1997. \\"Lyotard, Jean Francois (1924‚Äì)\\", pp. 205‚Äì208, in The A-Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists, Prentice Hall/Harvester Wheatsheaf. =The collapse of the \\"grand narrative\\" and \\"language-games\\"= Most famously, in La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge) (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the \\"postmodern\\" as an 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'. These meta- narratives‚Äîsometimes 'grand narratives'‚Äîare grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the progress of history, the knowability of everything by science, and the possibility of absolute freedom. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real and everyone had their own perspective and story.Lemert, Charles C.. \\"After Modern.\\" Social theory: the multicultural and classic readings.1993. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 456. We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives.Micronarratives For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of 'language-games' found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. \\"Jean Francois Lyotard.\\" Key contemporary social theorists. 2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 211. In Lyotard's works, the term 'language games', sometimes also called 'phrase regimens', denotes the multiplicity of communities of meaning, the innumerable and incommensurable separate systems in which meanings are produced and rules for their circulation are created.Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois (1984). The Postmodern Condition. 1st ed. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. pp. 66‚Äì67. This involves, for example, an incredulity towards the metanarrative of human emancipation. That is, the story of how the human race has set itself free that brings together the language game of science, the language game of human historical conflicts and the language game of human qualities into the overall justification of the steady development of the human race in terms of wealth and moral well-being. According to this metanarrative, the justification of science is related to wealth and education. The development of history is seen as a steady progress towards civilization or moral well-being. The language game of human passions, qualities and faults (c.f. character flaws (narratives)), is seen as steadily shifting in favor of our qualities and away from our faults as science and historical developments help us to conquer our faults in favor of our qualities. The point is that any event ought to be able to be understood in terms of the justifications of this metanarrative; anything that happens can be understood and judged according to the discourse of human emancipation. For example, for any new social, political or scientific revolution we could ask the question, \\"Is this revolution a step towards the greater well-being of the mass of human beings?\\" It should always be possible to answer this question in terms of the rules of justification of the metanarrative of human emancipation.Williams, James (1998). Lyotard: Toward a Postmodern Philosophy. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Inc, Print. p.32-33. This becomes more crucial in Au juste: Conversations (Just Gaming) (1979) and Le Diff√©rend (The Differend) (1983), which develop a postmodern theory of justice. It might appear that the atomisation of human beings implied by the notion of the micronarrative and the language game suggests a collapse of ethics. It has often been thought that universality is a condition for something to be a properly ethical statement: 'thou shalt not steal' is an ethical statement in a way that 'thou shalt not steal from Margaret' is not. The latter is too particular to be an ethical statement (what's so special about Margaret?); it is only ethical if it rests on a universal statement ('thou shalt not steal from anyone'). But universals are impermissible in a world that has lost faith in metanarratives, and so it would seem that ethics is impossible. Justice and injustice can only be terms within language games, and the universality of ethics is out of the window. Lyotard argues that notions of justice and injustice do in fact remain in postmodernism. The new definition of injustice is indeed to use the language rules from one 'phrase regimen' and apply them to another. Ethical behaviour is about remaining alert precisely to the threat of this injustice, about paying attention to things in their particularity and not enclosing them within abstract conceptuality. One must bear witness to the 'differend.' In a differend, there is a conflict between two parties that cannot be solved in a just manner. However, the act of being able to bridge the two and understand the claims of both parties, is the first step towards finding a solution. > \\"I would like to call a differend the case where the plaintiff is divested > of the means to argue and becomes for that reason a victim. If the > addressor, the addressee, and the sense of the testimony are neutralized, > everything takes place as if there were no damages. A case of differend > between two parties takes place when the regulation of the conflict that > opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the parties while the wrong > suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom.\\" In more than one book, Lyotard promoted what he called a new paganism. Plato, in Book II of The Republic, condemns pagans for their shape-shifting and deceitful gods, antithetical to universal truth. Lyotard prefers a mirror image of Plato's critique, vindicating the pagans as Plato sees them. A new paganism would revolt against Greek masculinism such as that of Plato. The revolt would be led by women, for woman is antirational and antiphilosophical (at least as Plato understands what it is to be philosophical). Woman, as \\"the little girl\\", is \\"the antonym of the adult male questioner\\" and would release us from the mental illness evident in Platonic philosophy, in Judaism and in the American, French and Russian revolutions. =The Differend= In The Differend, based on Immanuel Kant's views on the separation of Understanding, Judgment, and Reason, Lyotard identifies the moment in which language fails as the differend, and explains it as follows: \\"...the unstable state and instant of language wherein something which must be able to be put into phrases cannot yet be‚Ä¶ the human beings who thought they could use language as an instrument of communication, learn through the feeling of pain which accompanies silence (and of pleasure which accompanies the invention of a new idiom)\\".Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois (1988). The Differend: Phrases in Dispute. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. p. 13. Lyotard undermines the common view that the meanings of phrases can be determined by what they refer to (the referent). The meaning of a phrase‚Äîan event (something happens)--cannot be fixed by appealing to reality (what actually happened). Lyotard develops this view of language by defining \\"reality\\" in an original way, as a complex of possible senses attached to a referent through a name. The correct sense of a phrase cannot be determined by a reference to reality, since the referent itself does not fix sense, and reality itself is defined as the complex of competing senses attached to a referent. Therefore, the phrase event remains indeterminate. Lyotard uses the example of Auschwitz and the revisionist historian Robert Faurisson‚Äôs demands for proof of the Holocaust to show how the differend operates as a double bind. Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of gas chambers from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the gas chambers. However, any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no gas chambers, in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, or there were gas chambers, in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of gas chambers, except the testimony of actual victims, he will conclude from both possibilities (gas chambers existed and gas chambers did not exist) that gas chambers did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives, either there were gas chambers or there were not, which lead to the same conclusion: there were no gas chambers (and no final solution).Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois (1988). The Differend: Phrases in Dispute. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. pp. 16‚Äì17. The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgement upheld by Faurisson. =The sublime= Lyotard was a frequent writer on aesthetic matters. He was, despite his reputation as a postmodernist, a great promoter of modernist art. Lyotard saw postmodernism as a latent tendency within thought throughout time and not a narrowly limited historical period. He favoured the startling and perplexing works of the high modernist avant-garde. In them he found a demonstration of the limits of our conceptuality, a valuable lesson for anyone too imbued with Enlightenment confidence. Lyotard has written extensively also on many contemporary artists of his choice: Valerio Adami, Daniel Buren, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Monory, Ruth Francken, Shusaku Arakawa, Bracha Ettinger, Sam Francis, Karel Appel, Barnett Newman, Ren√© Guiffrey, , and Albert Ayme as well as on earlier artists, notably Paul C√©zanne and Paul Klee. He developed these themes in particular by discussing the sublime. The \\"sublime\\" is a term in aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after a century or more of neglect. It refers to the experience of pleasurable anxiety that we experience when confronting wild and threatening sights like, for example, a massive craggy mountain, black against the sky, looming terrifyingly in our vision. A sublime is the conjunction of two opposed feelings, which makes it harder for us to see the injustice of it, or a solution to it. Lyotard found particularly interesting the explanation of the sublime offered by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urtheilskraft, more exactly Critique of the Power of Judgment). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: there are two kinds of 'sublime' experience. In the 'mathematically' sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, we experience a clash between our reason (which tells us that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that organizes what we see, and which sees an object incalculably larger than ourselves, and feels infinite). In the 'dynamically' sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we, whose weight, force, scale could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it. (Kant stresses that if we are in actual danger, our feeling of anxiety is very different from that of a sublime feeling. The sublime is an aesthetic experience, not a practical feeling of personal danger.) This explains the feeling of anxiety. What is deeply unsettling about the mathematically sublime is that the mental faculties that present visual perceptions to the mind are inadequate to the concept corresponding to it; in other words, what we are able to make ourselves see cannot fully match up to what we know is there. We know it's a mountain but we cannot take the whole thing into our perception. Our sensibility is incapable of coping with such sights, but our reason can assert the finitude of the presentation. With the dynamically sublime, our sense of physical danger should prompt an awareness that we are not just physical material beings, but moral and (in Kant's terms) noumenal beings as well. The body may be dwarfed by its power but our reason need not be. This explains, in both cases, why the sublime is an experience of pleasure as well as pain. Lyotard is fascinated by this admission, from one of the philosophical architects of the Enlightenment, that the mind cannot always organise the world rationally. Some objects are simply incapable of being brought neatly under concepts. For Lyotard, in Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime, but drawing on his argument in The Differend, this is a good thing. Such generalities as 'concepts' fail to pay proper attention to the particularity of things. What happens in the sublime is a crisis where we realise the inadequacy of the imagination and reason to each other. What we are witnessing, says Lyotard, is actually the differend; the straining of the mind at the edges of itself and at the edges of its conceptuality. =Libidinal Economy= In one of Lyotard's most famous books, Libidinal Economy, he offers a critique of Marx‚Äôs idea of \\"false consciousness\\" and claims that the 19th- century working class enjoyed being a part of the industrialization process. Lyotard claims that this was due to libidinal energythe term \\"libidinal\\" coming from the term libido, used in psychoanalysis to refer to the desires of our deeper consciousness. Libidinal Economy has been called an achievement in our attempts to live with the rejection of all religious and moral principles through an undermining of the structures associated with it.Lemert, Charles. 2013. \\"The Idea of the Postmodern\\" Pp. 465‚Äì468 in Social Theory: The Multicultural, Global, and Classic Readings, Westview Press. Boulder, CO. Structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings and desires force us away from set structures. However, there also can be no intensities or desires without structures, because there would be no dream of escaping the repressive structures if they do not exist. \\"Libidinal energy comes from this disruptive intervention of external events within structures that seek order and self-containment.\\" This was the first of Lyotard's writings that had really criticized a Marxist view. It achieved great success, but was also the last of Lyotard's writings on this particular topic where he really opposed the views of Marx. =Les Immat√©riaux= In 1985, Lyotard co-curated the exhibition Les Immat√©riaux at the Centre de Cr√©ation Industrielle at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, together with the design theorist and curator Thierry Chaput. =\\"Mainmise\\"= Lyotard was impressed by the importance of childhood in human life,J-F Lyotard, The Postmodern Explained to Children (London 1992) p. 112 which he saw as providing the opportunity of creativity, as opposed to the settled hubris of maturity.R Shields ed., Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard (2016) p 142 In \\"Mainmise\\", however, he also explored the hold of childhood experience on the individual through the (Roman) concept of mancipium, an authoritative right of possession. Because parental influences affect the new-born before it has the linguistic skill even to articulate them, let alone oppose them, Lyotard considered that \\"We are born from others but also to others, given over defenceless to them. Subject to their mancipium.\\"Quoted in K. Still ed., Minima Memoria (Stanford 2007) p. 202 Later life and death Some of the latest works that Lyotard had been working on were both writings about a French writer, activist, and politician, Andr√© Malraux. One of them being a biography, Signed, Malraux. Lyotard was interested in the aesthetic views of society that Malraux shared. Lyotard's other book was named The Confession of Augustine and was a study in the phenomenology of time. This work-in-progress was published posthumously in the same year of Lyotard's death. Lyotard repeatedly returned to the notion of the Postmodern in essays gathered in English as The Postmodern Explained to Children, Toward the Postmodern, and Postmodern Fables. In 1998, while preparing for a conference on postmodernism and media theory, he died unexpectedly from a case of leukemia that had advanced rapidly. He is buried in Division 6 of P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Criticism There are three major criticisms of Lyotard's work. Each coincides with a school of thought. Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy have written deconstructions of Lyotard's work (Derrida 1992; Nancy 1985).Derrida, Jacques. 2005. On Touching, Jean-Luc-Nancy, Stanford University Press. They focus on Lyotard's postmodern work and on The Differend in particular. A differend depends upon a distinction drawn between groups that itself depends upon the heterogeneity of language games and genres of discourse. Why should these differences be privileged over an endless division and reconstruction of groups? In concentrating on specific differences, Lyotard's thought becomes overly dependent on differences; between categories that are given as fixed and well defined. From the point of view of deconstruction, Lyotard's philosophy gives too much credit to illegitimate categories and groups. Underlying any differend there is a multiplicity of further differences; some of these will involve crossing the first divide, others will question the integrity of the groups that were originally separated.Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. \\"Jean Francois Lyotard.\\" Key contemporary social theorists.2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 214. Manfred Frank (1988) has put the Frankfurt School criticism best. It attacks Lyotard's search for division over consensus on the grounds that it involves a philosophical mistake with serious political and social repercussions. Lyotard has failed to notice that an underlying condition for consensus is also a condition for the successful communication of his own thought. It is a performative contradiction to give an account that appeals to our reason on behalf of a difference that is supposed to elude it. So, in putting forward a false argument against a rational consensus, Lyotard plays into the hands of the irrational forces that often give rise to injustice and differ ends. Worse, he is then only in a position to testify to that injustice, rather than put forward a just and rational resolution. From a Nietzschean and Deleuzian point of view (James Williams 2000), Lyotard's postmodern philosophy took a turn toward a destructive modern nihilism that his early work avoids. The different and the sublime are negative terms that introduce a severe pessimism at the core of Lyotard's philosophy. Both terms draw lines that cannot be crossed and yet they mark the threshold of that which is most valuable for the philosophy, that which is to be testified to and its proper concern. It is not possible repetitively to lend an ear to the sublime without falling into despair due to its fleeting nature. Whenever we try to understand or even memorize: the activity of testimony through the sublime, it can only be as something that has now dissipated and that we cannot capture. Charles J. Stivale reviwed Lyotard's The Differend (in English translation) in 1990, stating: Influence The collective tribute to Lyotard following his death was organized by the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie, and chaired by Dolores Lyotard and Jean-Claude Milner, the College's director at that time. The proceedings were published by PUF in 2001 under the general title Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, l'exercice du diff√©rend. Lyotard's work continues to be important in politics, philosophy, sociology, literature, art, and cultural studies.Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. \\"Jean Francois Lyotard.\\" Key contemporary social theorists.2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 35. To mark the tenth anniversary of Lyotard's death, an international symposium about Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard organized by the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie (under the direction of Dolores Lyotard, Jean-Claude Milner and Gerald Sfez) was held in Paris from January 25‚Äì27 in 2007.

Jeb Stuart's cavalry performed a series of raids around George McClellan's army in the Seven Days Battles by using hit-and-run tactics. Hit-and-run tactics are a tactical doctrine of using short surprise attacks, withdrawing before the enemy can respond in force, and constantly maneuvering to avoid full engagement with the enemy. The purpose is not to decisively defeat the enemy or capture territory but to weaken enemy forces over time through raids, harassment, and skirmishing and limiting risk to friendly forces. Such tactics can also expose enemy defensive weaknesses and achieve a psychological effect on the enemy's morale. Hit-and-run is a favored tactic where the enemy overmatches the attacking force and any sustained combat is to be avoided, such as guerrilla warfare, militant resistance movements, and terrorism. However, regular army forces often employ hit-and-run tactics in the short term, usually in preparation for a later full-scale engagement with the enemy when and where conditions are more favorable. Examples of the latter include commando or other special forces attacks, reconnaissance-in-force, or sorties from a fortress, castle, or other strongpoint. Hit-and-run tactics were also used by the lightly-armed horse archers, typical of the Eurasian steppe peoples, who excelled at them. That holds especially true for such troops that were not part of a large army (such as scouting parties), but it was common to see them employed in such a way even as part of a major force. Historical use Romans first encountered that tactic in the Lusitanian War in which Lusitanians used the tactic called concursare (\\"bustling\\"). It involved charging forwards against the enemy lines, only to retreat after a brief clash or without clashing, which would be followed by more attacks in a similar cadence. The Lusitanians drove the Roman armies to break formation and chase them, leading them to traps and ambushes. The Seljuk victory over the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert was preceded by hit-and-run attacks of Seljuk cavalryHaldon, pp. 565‚Äì1204., which threw the Byzantine army into confusion and proved fatal once it started to retreat. Similarly, the earlier Parthian and Sassanid Persian horse archers paved the way for their cataphracts' attack, which achieved the decisive victories at the Battle of Carrhae and Battle of Edessa. The use of hit-and-run tactics dates back even earlier to the nomadic Scythians of Central Asia, who used them against Darius the Great's Persian Achaemenid Empire and later against Alexander the Great's Macedonian Empire. The Turkish general Baibars also successfully used hit-and- run during the Battle of Ain Jalut,Hamad Subani, The Secret History of Iran, page 128, accessdate 4 June, 2019John Block Friedman, Kristen Mossler Figg, Trade, Travel, and Exploration in the Middle Ages: An Encyclopedia, page 406, accessdate 4 June, 2019 the first defeat of the quickly expanding Mongol Empire.Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World. Vastly outnumbered in North America, the French made effective use of hit-and- run raids during the various French and Indian Wars.Spencer Tucker, Almanac of American Military History, Volume 1, pp.10‚Äì11 In the Turkish War of Independence, the Turks fought against the Greeks by hit-and-run tactics before a regular army was set up.Belleten, page 1087. Marathas under shivaji and his successors also resorted to hit and run tactics against Mughal Empire. During the Vietnam War, Viet Cong forces used hit-and-run tactics to great effectiveness against the anticommunist military forces.. The United States Navy SEALs of the American military during the Vietnam War also used hit-and- run tactics to great effect against the Viet Cong in return. With the element of surprise, the United States Navy SEALs would raid or ambush their communist adversaries in communist held areas to eliminate Viet Cong fighters, kill/capture high ranking Viet Cong members, destroy certain targets, attack the enemy supply lines, or gathering intelligence such as documents from the Viet Cong fighters they killed. Then the SEALs would withdraw back to friendly territory by medium boats, sampans, or helicopter. Usually with great success.\\"The Element of Surprise: Navy Seals in Vietnam\\" by Darryl Young \\"SEAL Warrior: The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday\\" by Thomas H. Keith The tactic was also used in Afghanistan by rebel forces during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Various Iraqi insurgent groups have also used hit-and-run tactics as part of their tactics against Iraqi security forces and American-led coalition forces in Iraq. Improvised fighting vehicles, called \\"technicals\\", are often used in such operations.  In economics The term \\"hit-and-run\\" is also used in economics to describe a firm that enters a market to take advantage of abnormal profits and then leave. These tactics can be seen in a contestable market.

Recording for Tactical took place at Mader's HIV + Cocksplitter Studios and second engineer Michael Keene's Keene Machine Studios in Los Angeles. Death guitarist James Murphy joined the group as a guest musician, performing guitar solos, bass and keyboards on numerous songs on the album, which he also mixed and mastered. Release and reception Recording for the album was completed by March 2010, but due to Miller's return to working with CKY its release was pushed back from July 2010 to July 2011. Although no singles were released from Tactical, a music video (directed by Shan Dan Horan) was produced for the song \\"Into the Arms of Cruelty\\". Upon its release, Tactical reached number 32 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, selling approximately 900 copies in the week of release. Composition Lyrically, Tactical deals with a number of complex personal and philosophical concepts, which Miller detailed in a track-by-track feature prior to the album's release. Within the feature, the band's frontman proclaimed that he was \\"obsessed with mental illness\\", and noted that at least three tracks on the album featured lyrical references to various mental conditions ‚Äì \\"Pyro-Compulsive\\" is based on \\"the idea of someone lusting over lighting their house on fire while they're inside\\"; \\"Dead and Still in Pain\\" is written about depression and anxiety, in particular \\"not knowing what to do with yourself or where to turn\\"; and \\"Under the Autumn Low\\" references seasonal affective disorder, from which Miller claims he suffers on a regular basis. \\"Into the Arms of Cruelty\\", which Miller has claimed is one of his favourite songs on the album, is described as the vocalist's \\"unrestrained opinion\\" on child abuse, which he says makes him \\"fucking sick\\". A number of tracks also deal with viewpoints on political issues ‚Äì opening track \\"A God Among the Waste\\", for example, is described as a song about \\"finding a legitimate political leader, and finally cleaning up the U.S.\\", while the lyrics of \\"Purgatory Dormitory\\" discuss the idea of using torture as a punishment for criminals, with Miller theorising about \\"numbing every nerve in a criminal‚Äôs body, blinding and deafening them, and leaving them with just their brain ... to think and to suffer\\". Organized religion is another subject discussed on Tactical, in particular on the track \\"I Can't Stand His Name\\", which is aimed at no particular faith or religious practice in particular but instead concerns the general power and style of organized religion, including preaching. The final original track on the album, \\"Revere's Tears\\", is based on the story of George Revere, who is described by Miller as \\"a genius doctor\\" who allegedly discovered a cure for cancer before being murdered; the song is essentially written about the conspiracy theory that \\"if you do discover a cure for cancer, you will either be privately bought out, or killed\\", with the singer making reference to other diseases such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes.

The Montreal Biodome () is a facility located at Olympic Park in the Mercier‚ÄìHochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that allows visitors to walk through replicas of four ecosystems found in the Americas. The building was originally constructed for the 1976 Olympic Games as a velodrome. It hosted both track cycling and judo events. Renovations on the building began in 1989 and in 1992 the indoor nature exhibit was opened. The Montreal Biodome is one of four facilities that make part of the largest natural science museum complex in Canada, Space for Life, which also includes the Montreal Insectarium, Montreal Botanical Garden, and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium. It is an accredited member of both the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and the Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums association (CAZA). History The building was designed by French architect Roger Taillibert as part of his larger plan for an Olympic park that included the Montreal Olympic Stadium and the Olympic pool. The venue was a combined velodrome and judo facility. Construction of the building began in August 1973, and the facility was officially opened in April 1976. The velodrome, along with the accompanying Olympic pool, inspired Tallibert's later designs for Luxembourg's National Sports and Culture Centre. In 1988, a feasibility study was conducted for converting the velodrome into a biodome. Construction started in 1989, and the facility was opened to the public on 18 June 1992 as the Montreal Biodome. In the summer of 2003, the Biodome installed an audio guide system that lets visitors get information about what they are viewing, and also provides statistics to the facility about what the visitors find most interesting. Visitors can rent a receiver programmed to receive French, Spanish, or English for adults, or French or English for children. Exhibits The facility allows visitors to walk through replicas of four ecosystems found in the Americas: * The Tropical Forest is a replica of the South American rainforest. * The Laurentian Forest is a replica of the North American wilderness. * The Saint Lawrence Marine Eco-system is an estuary habitat modelled on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. *The Sub-Polar Region is a habitat that is divided into Arctic and Antarctic. All the exhibits are housed inside the former velodrome (cycling stadium) that was used for the cycling and judo events of the 1976 Summer Olympics, with each of the four environments taking up a portion of the stadium. A variety of animals live in each simulated habitat, ranging from the macaws in the Tropical Forest, to the lynx in the Laurentian Forest, to the penguins in the Antarctic and the different kinds of fish that inhabit the waters of the Saint Lawrence River. As well, two new species have been discovered living in the Biodome: the acarian Copidognathus biodomus in the simulated estuary in 1996, and the bacterium Nitratireductor aquibiodomus in the water reprocessing system in 2003. Renovation In October 2015, it was announced that both the Biodome and the Insectarium would be closing their doors to the public from September 2016 to December 2017, in order to receive a facelift, as part of the city of Montreal's 375th anniversary;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/biodome- and-insectarium-closed-renovations-1.3262780 however, in August 2016, the mayor of Montreal cancelled the contract to renovate the Biodome, because the bid results received by the city were much higher than the initial estimates.https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-puts-biodome- project-on-ice-after-contract-bids-come-in-at-double-the-estimate The facelift project went back to a bidding process.

It derives from cattle native to the counties of Aberdeenshire and Angus in north-eastern Scotland.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 15th Ed. Vol.10 p.1280 The Angus is naturally polled and solid black or red, though the udder may be white. The native colour is black, but more recently red colours have emerged. The United Kingdom registers both in the same herd book, but in the United States they are regarded as two separate breeds: Red Angus and Black Angus. Black Angus is the most common breed of beef cattle in the US, with 332,421 cattle registered in 2017. In 2014, the British Cattle Movement Service named Angus the UK's most popular native beef breed, and the second most popular beef breed overall. History =Scotland= Aberdeen Angus cattle have been recorded in Scotland since at least the 16th century in the country's northeast. For some time before the 1800s, the hornless cattle in Aberdeenshire and Angus were called Angus doddies. In 1824, William McCombie of Tillyfour, MP for South Aberdeenshire, began to improve the stock and is regarded today as the father of the breed. Many local names emerged, including doddies or hummlies. The first herd book was created in 1862, and the society was formed in 1879. This is considered late, given that the cattle gained mainstream acceptance in the middle of the eighteenth century. The cattle became commonplace throughout the British Isles in the middle of the 20th century. =Argentina= As stated in the fourth volume of the Herd Book of the UK's Angus, this breed was introduced to Argentina in 1879 when \\"Don Carlos Guerrero\\" imported one bull and two cows for his Estancia \\"Charles\\" located in Juancho, Partido de General Madariaga, Provincia de Buenos Aires. The bull was born on 19 April 1878; named \\"Virtuoso 1626\\" and raised by Colonel Ferguson. The cows were named \\"Aunt Lee 4697\\" raised by J. James and \\"Cinderela 4968\\" raised by R. Walker and were both born in 1878, on 31 January and 23 April respectively.Historia de la Caba√±a Charles de Guerrero, criadora de Angus desde 1879 =Australia= Angus cattle were first introduced to Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) in the 1820s and to the southern mainland in 1840. The breed is now found in all Australian states and territories with 62,000 calves registered with Angus Australia in 2010. =Canada= In 1876 William Brown, a professor of agriculture and then superintendent of the experimental farm at Guelph, Ontario, was granted permission by the government of Ontario to purchase Aberdeen Angus cattle for the Ontario Agricultural College. The herd comprised a yearling bull, Gladiolus, and a cow, Eyebright, bred by the Earl of Fife and a cow, Leochel Lass 4th, bred by R.O. Farquharson. On 12 January 1877, Eyebright gave birth to a calf, sired by Sir Wilfrid. It was the first to be born outside of Scotland. The OAC went on to import additional bulls and cows, eventually began selling Aberdeen Angus cattle in 1881. =United States= On 17 May 1873, George Grant brought four Angus bulls, without any cows, to Victoria, Kansas. These were seen as unusual as the normal American cattle consisted of Shorthorns and Longhorns, and the bulls were used only in crossbreeding. However, the farmers noticed the good qualities of these bulls and afterwards, many more cattle of both sexes were imported. On 21 November 1883, the American Angus Association was founded in Chicago, Illinois. The first herd book was published on March 1885. At this time both red and black animals were registered without distinction. However, in 1917 the Association barred the registering of red and other coloured animals in an effort to promote a solid black breed. The Red Angus Association of America was founded in 1954 by breeders of Red Angus cattle. It was formed because the breeders had had their cattle struck off the herd book for not conforming to the changed breed standard regarding colour. =Germany= A separate breed was cross bred in Germany called the German Angus. It is a cross between the Angus and several different cattle such as the German Black Pied Cattle, Gelbvieh, and Fleckvieh. The cattle are usually larger than the Angus and appear in black and red colours.  Characteristics  Because of their native environment, the cattle are very hardy and can survive the Scottish winters, which are typically harsh, with snowfall and storms. Cows typically weigh and bulls weigh . Calves are usually born smaller than is acceptable for the market, so crossbreeding with dairy cattle is needed for veal production. The cattle are naturally polled and black in colour. They typically mature earlier than other native British breeds such as the Hereford or North Devon. However, in the middle of the 20th century a new strain of cattle called the Red Angus emerged. The United States does not accept Red Angus cattle into herd books, while the UK and Canada do. Except for their colour genes, there is no genetic difference between black and red Angus, but they are regarded as different breeds in the US. However, there have been claims that black angus are more sustainable to cold weather, though unconfirmed. The cattle have a large muscle content and are regarded as medium-sized. The meat is very popular in Japan for its marbling qualities.Mixed herd of Black and Red Angus =Genetic disorders= There are four recessive defects that can affect calves worldwide. A recessive defect occurs when both parents carry a recessive gene that will affect the calf. One in four calves will show the defect even when both parents carry the defective gene. The four recessive defects in the Black Angus breed that are currently managed with DNA tests are arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), referred to as curly calf, which lowers the mobility of joints; neuropathic hydrocephalus (NH), sometimes known as water head, which causes an enlarged malformed skull; contractural arachnodactyly (CA), formerly referred to by the name of \\"fawn calf syndrome\\", which reduces mobility in the hips; and dwarfism, which affects the size of calves. Both parents need to carry the genes for a calf to be affected with one of these disorders.Vidler, Adam, Defects on rise as gene pool drains, p. 63, The Land, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSWAnother genetic defect affects Angus cattle Retrieved on 29 May Because of this, the American Angus Association will remove the carrier cattle from the breed in an effort to reduce the number of cases. Between 2008 and 2010, the American Angus Association reported worldwide recessive genetic disorders in Angus cattle. It has been shown that a small minority of Angus cattle can carry osteoporosis. A further defect called notomelia, a form of polymelia (\\"many legs\\") was reported in the Angus breed in 2010. Uses The main use of Angus cattle is for beef production and consumption. The beef can be marketed as superior due to its marbled appearance. This has led to many markets, including Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom to adopt it into the mainstream. Angus cattle can also be used in crossbreeding to reduce the likelihood of dystocia (difficult calving), and because of their dominant polled gene, they can be used to crossbreed to create polled calves.Angus calf with its mother =Commercial= Starting in the early 2000s, the American fast food industry began running a public relations campaign to promote the supposedly superior quality of Angus beef. Beginning in 2006, McDonald's commenced testing on hamburgers made with Angus beef in several regions in the US. After this test, the company said that customer response to the burgers was positive and began selling the burger made with Angus beef in all US locations in July 2009. In response to the test in the US, McDonald's Australia began selling two Angus burgers, the Grand Angus and the Mighty Angus, using Australian-bred Angus, in their restaurants. The American Angus Association created the \\"Certified Angus Beef\\" (CAB) standard in 1978. The purpose of this standard was to promote the idea that Angus beef was of higher quality than beef from other breeds of cattle. Cattle are eligible for \\"Certified Angus Beef\\" evaluation if they are at least 51% black and exhibit Angus influence, which include black Simmental cattle and crossbreds. However, they must meet all 10 of the following criteria, which were refined in January 2007 to further enhance product consistency, in order to be labelled \\"Certified Angus Beef\\" by USDA Graders: * Modest or higher degree of marbling * Medium or fine marbling texture * \\"A\\" maturity * 10 to 16 square-inch ribeye area * Less than 1,050-pound hot carcass weight * Less than 1-inch fat thickness * Moderately thick or thicker muscling * No hump on the neck exceeding 5 cm (2\\") * Practically free of capillary rupture * No dark cutting characteristics * Usually black or red in color See also * List of Cattle breeds originating in Scotland * List of cattle breeds References External links * History of the Angus cattle ‚Äì Oklahoma State University =Breed associations= Unless otherwise stated, the associations below register both red and black animals. * Official website of the Aberdeen Angus Cattle Society * Irish Angus Cattle Society Ltd.

Its official designation was \\"Fusil Mitrailleur Modele 1915 CSRG\\" (\\"Machine Rifle Model 1915 CSRG\\"). Beginning in June 1916, it was placed into regular service with French infantry, where the troops called it the FM Chauchat, after Colonel Louis Chauchat, the main contributor to its design. The Chauchat in 8mm Lebel was also extensively used in 1917‚Äì18 by the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), where it was officially designated as the \\"Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)\\". A total of 262,000 Chauchats were manufactured between December 1915 and November 1918, including 244,000 chambered for the 8mm Lebel service cartridge, making it the most widely manufactured automatic weapon of World War I. The armies of eight other nations‚ÄîBelgium, Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia‚Äîalso used the Chauchat machine rifle in fairly large numbers during and after World War I. The Chauchat was one of the first light, automatic rifle-caliber weapons designed to be carried and fired by a single operator and an assistant, without a heavy tripod or a team of gunners. It set a precedent for several subsequent 20th-century firearm projects, being a portable, yet full-power automatic weapon built inexpensively and in very large numbers. The Chauchat combined a pistol grip, an in-line stock, a detachable magazine, and a selective fire capability in a compact package of manageable weight (20 pounds) for a single soldier. Furthermore, it could be routinely fired from the hip and while walking (marching fire). The Chauchat is the only mass produced fully-automatic weapon actuated by long recoil, a Browning-designed system already applied in 1906 to the Remington Model 8 semi-automatic rifle: extraction and ejection of the empties takes place when the barrel returns forward, while the bolt is retained in the rear position. Afterwards the barrel trips a lever which releases the bolt and allows it to chamber another round. The muddy trenches of northern France exposed a number of weaknesses in the Chauchat's design. Construction had been simplified to facilitate mass production, resulting in low quality of many metal parts. The magazines in particular were the cause of about 75% of the stoppages or cessations of fire; they were made of thin metal and open on one side, allowing for the entry of mud and dust. The weapon also ceased to function when overheated, the barrel sleeve remaining in the retracted position until the gun had cooled off. Consequently, in September 1918, barely two months before the Armistice of November 11, the A.E.F. in France had already initiated the process of replacing the Chauchat with the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. Shortly after World War I, the French army replaced the Chauchat with the new gas-operated Mle 1924 light machine gun. It was mass manufactured during World War I by two reconverted civilian plants: \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Sidarme\\". Besides the 8mm Lebel version, the Chauchat machine rifle was also manufactured in U.S. .30-06 Springfield and in 7.65√ó53mm Argentine Mauser caliber to arm the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.) and the Belgian Army, respectively. The Belgian military did not experience difficulties with their Chauchats in 7.65mm Mauser and kept them in service into the early 1930s, as did the Polish Army. Conversely, the Chauchat version in U.S. .30-06 made by \\"Gladiator\\" for the A.E.F., the Model 1918, proved to be fundamentally defective and had to be withdrawn from service. The weapon has a poor reputation in some quarters, with some experts assessing it as the worst machine gun ever fielded. Although this may be the case, outside of the muddy conditions of the trenches, many say the gun is easy to control, has a good sight picture, and is actually quite reliable when not jammed with mud and dirt. History The design of the Chauchat dates back to 1903, and its long recoil operation is based on the John Browning-designed Remington Model 8 semi-automatic rifle of 1906, not (as so often repeated in the past) on the later designs (1910) of Rudolf Frommer, the Hungarian inventor of the commercial Frommer Stop pistol. The Chauchat machine rifle project was initiated between 1903 and 1910 in a French Army weapon research facility located near Paris: Atelier de Construction de Puteaux (APX). This development was aiming at creating a very light, portable automatic weapon served by one man only, yet firing the 8 mm Lebel service ammunition. The project was led from the beginning by Colonel Louis Chauchat, a graduate from Ecole Polytechnique, assisted by senior armorer Charles Sutter. Not less than eight trial prototypes were tested at APX, between 1903 and 1909. As a result, a small series (100 guns) of 8 mm Lebel CS (Chauchat-Sutter) machine rifles was ordered in 1911, then manufactured between 1913 and 1914 by Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne (MAS). Because they were light, they were used temporarily during the early part of World War I to arm observation crews on French military aircraft. None of these CS machine rifles have survived, either in public museums or in private collections. Only a fairly complete photographic record of their past existence remains. In 1914, when World War I broke out, French troops did not operate any light machine gun. It was clear that this type of weapon had become indispensable in modern warfare, because of the increase in firepower it could provide to an infantry section. Spurred by General Joseph Joffre, it was decided to adopt the Chauchat, above all else because the pre-war CS (Chauchat-Sutter) machine rifle was already in existence, thoroughly tested, and designed to fire the 8mm Lebel service ammunition. Furthermore, due to its projected low manufacturing costs and relative simplicity, the newly adopted (1915) CSRG machine rifle could be mass-produced by a converted peacetime industrial plant. The term CSRG is made up of the initials of Chauchat, Sutter, Ribeyrolles and Gladiator, the respective manufacturers. Paul Ribeyrolles was the general manager of the Gladiator company, a peacetime manufacturer of motor cars, motorcycles, and bicycles located in Pre-Saint-Gervais (a northern suburb of Paris). The fairly large Gladiator factory was thus converted into an arms manufacturer in 1915 and became the principal industrial producer of Chauchat machine rifles during World War I. Later on, in 1918, a subsidiary of Compagnie des forges et acieries de la marine et d'Homecourt named SIDARME and located in Saint- Chamond, Loire, also participated in the mass manufacture of CSRGs. Design details Bolt of the Chauchat machine gun. Shooting the Chauchat The Chauchat machine rifle or \\"automatic rifle\\" functioned on the long barrel recoil principle with a gas assist. The Chauchat machine rifle (CSRG) delivered to the French Army fired the 8mm Lebel cartridge at the slow rate of 240 rounds per minute. At , the gun was much lighter than the contemporary portable light machine guns of the period, such as the Hotchkiss M1909 Ben√©t‚ÄìMerci√© machine gun and the Lewis gun. It was a selective fire weapon, either on automatic or semi-automatic mode. The Chauchat's construction was a mix of new, high quality components, re-used parts proven in other designs, and the shoddy and sub standard . This combination did not help in the reliability of the weapon. The recoiling barrel sleeve, as well as all the bolt moving parts, were precision milled from solid steel and always fully interchangeable. The barrels were standard Lebel rifle barrels that had been shortened from the muzzle end. The barrel radiators were made of ribbed cast aluminum. On the other hand, the outer breech housing was a simple tube, and the rest of the gun was built of stamped metal plates of mediocre quality. Side plate assemblies were held by screws that could become loose after prolonged firings. The sights were always misaligned on the Gladiator-made guns, creating severe aiming problems that had to be corrected by the gunners. The exact number on record of Chauchat machine rifles manufactured between 1916 and the end of 1918 is 262,300. The Gladiator factory manufactured 225,700 CSRGs in 8 mm Lebel plus 19,000 in the U.S. caliber .30-06 between April 1916 and November 1918. SIDARME manufactured 18,600 CSRGs, exclusively in 8mm Lebel, between October 1917 and November 1918. The SIDARME-manufactured Chauchats were generally better finished and better functioning than those made by Gladiator. The French Army had a stock of 63,000 CSRG's just before the Armistice. The French military at the time considered the Chauchat's performance as inferior in comparison to the reliable heavy Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. However, whereas the Hotchkiss was a weighty, tripod-mounted weapon, the Chauchat was a light, portable gun that could be mass-produced quickly, cheaply, and in very large numbers. It was also never intended to take the role of static defense of the heavy machine gun. On the contrary, it was designed to be a light, thus highly portable, automatic weapon that would increase the firepower of infantry squads while they progressed forward during assaults. A significant plus is that it could easily be fired while walking (marching fire), by hanging the Chauchat's sling over a shoulder hook located onto the gunner's upper left side of his Y‚Äìstrap. The CSRG 1915 Chauchat was operated with Balle D 8mm ammunition, which was standard for the French until 1932 when they went to an improved Balle N 8mm Lebel cartridge. The Chauchats, as they were retired, were not converted to the Balle N, and as a result, they do not operate well with the Balle N cartridge (French World War I weapons converted to Balle N will have a noticeable \\"N\\" markings). Only Balle D 8mm should be used in the Chauchat 1915. The quickest way to identify the different cartridge is that the Balle D bullet is brass colored while the Balle N is a shiny silver. Service French soldiers with a FM Chauchat, Somme, 1918. The Mle 1915 Chauchat's performance on the battlefield drew decidedly mixed reviews from the users when the war was stagnating in the mud of the trenches in 1916. This brought about a survey, regiment by regiment, requested by General P√©tain in late 1916; the survey's essential conclusion was that the open-sided half-moon magazines were defective and caused about two thirds of all stoppages. For instance, it was a common practice for the gunners to oil up the inside of the magazines to facilitate movement of the 8mm Lebel rounds. Also, loose earth, grit, and other particles easily entered the gun through these open-sided magazines, an ever-present risk in the muddy environment of the trenches. An insistence on using only good, undeformed magazines with strong springs was the most practical solution to this problem. Chauchat gunners were also known to load their magazines with 18 or 19 rounds, instead of the maximum 20, in order to avoid the dreaded first-round failure to feed. The Chauchat's long recoil system is often cited as a source of excessive stress on the gunner when firing, though recent and extensive firing tests have demonstrated that it is the Chauchat's ergonomics and its loose bipod, rather than its recoil, that makes it a difficult gun to keep on target beyond very short bursts. On most of the Gladiator-made guns, the sights also made the Chauchat shoot systematically too low and to the right, a failing which was soon recognized but never corrected. Overheating during uninterrupted periods of full automatic fire (about 120 rounds with the 8mm Lebel version) often resulted in the barrel sleeve assembly locking in the rear position due to thermal expansion, causing stoppage of fire until the gun had cooled off. Hence, French and US Army manuals recommended firing in short bursts or semi-auto only. In essence, the Chauchat was a rather heavy but portable machine gun with limited full auto capability, rather than a true \\"light machine gun\\", hence, in 1918, the A.E.F. officially labeled the Chauchat in its user manuals as an \\"automatic rifle\\". =American service= US .30-06 version (top) and French 8mm version (bottom). While rate of fire restrictions (250 rounds/minute) made the gun manageable in its 8mm Lebel version, the U.S. .30-06 version fired more powerful cartridges that exacerbated the problems of overheating. Furthermore, the 18,000 Chauchats in .30-06 delivered to the A.E.F. were not conversions of the French model. Rather, they were newly manufactured guns which had been delivered directly to the A.E.F. by the Gladiator factory. As documented from the original American and French military archives, most of these Mle 1918 Chauchats in .30-06 were flawed from the beginning due to incomplete chamber reaming and other dimensional defects acquired during the manufacturing process at the Gladiator factory. Very few .30-06 Chauchats reached the front lines of northern France; however, when they did, it was reportedly not uncommon for U.S. units to simply discard their Chauchats in favor of M1903 Springfield rifles and cease to function as an auto-rifle squad altogether.Hoff, Thomas. US Doughboy 1916‚Äì19. Osprey, 2012. Whereas instruction manuals in both French and English for the 8mm Lebel Chauchat are still commonly found today, instruction manuals for the US 30-06 \\"American Chauchat\\" have never been seen in U.S. and French military archives or in private collections. Chauchat in American service 308th and 166th Infantry Regiments liberate a French town in 1918. The soldier on the left is carrying a Chauchat slung over his shoulder. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) arrived in France without automatic weapons or field artillery. Consequently, it turned to its French ally to purchase ordnance. General Pershing chose the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun and the Chauchat machine rifle (designated as \\"Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)\\" by the AEF and nicknamed the \\"Sho-Sho\\" by the troops) to equip U.S. infantry. Between August 1917 and the November 11, 1918 Armistice with Germany, the Gladiator factory delivered to the AEF 16,000 Chauchats in 8 mm Lebel and, late in 1918, 19,000 Chauchats in .30-06. While the performance of the M1915 Chauchat in 8 mm Lebel was combat-effective, judging by the numbers of decorated U.S. Chauchat gunners found in the U.S. Divisional Histories, the performance of the M1918 Chauchat in .30-06 was soon recognized as abysmal (and in large part the reason for the gun's bad reputation). The most common problem was a failure to extract after the gun had fired only a few rounds and became slightly hot. A modern-day test firing of the M1918 30-06 Chauchat was performed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in July 1973, but no particular problem was described in the official report, which is accessible on open file. Conversely, an exhaustive firing test of the M1918 Chauchat in .30-06 was also carried out in 1994 near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, by R. Keller and W. Garofalo. Their testing, which is reported in \\"The Chauchat Machine Rifle\\" volume, did expose severe extraction problems caused by incorrect chamber measurements and other substandard manufacturing. During World War I, in 1918, the preserved U.S. archival record also documents that American inspectors at the Gladiator factory had rejected about 40% of the .30-06 Chauchat production, while the remaining 60% proved problematic whenever they reached the front lines. Supplies of the newly manufactured and superior M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) were allocated sparingly and only very late, during the Meuse-Argonne offensive, which began in late September 1918. Therefore, about 75% of the U.S. Divisions were still equipped with the Chauchat ‚Äì in its original French M1915 version in 8 mm Lebel ‚Äì at the time of the Armistice of November 11, 1918. It is also well documented that General Pershing had been holding back on the BAR until victory was certain, for fear it would be copied by Germany. However, it is also known that the very first BARs delivered had improperly tempered recoil springs, and had these guns been prematurely introduced during the summer of 1918, their employment may also have been problematic. One of the most significant accounts of the Chauchat's poor performance was from then-lieutenant Lemuel Shepherd, who was quoted saying: As documented by World War I veteran Laurence Stallings (in The Doughboys, 1963) and by U.S. Divisional Histories, the Medal of Honor was awarded to three American Chauchat gunners in 1918: 1) Private Nels Wold (35th Division, 138th Infantry). 2) Private Frank Bart (2nd Division, 9th Infantry) and 3) Private Thomas C. Neibaur (42nd Division, 107th Infantry).Medal of Honor Recipients World War I army.mil =Improvements= Several prototypes of dirt-proof, fully enclosed Chauchat magazines were successfully tested in May and June 1918, but came too late to be placed into service. Stronger open- sided standard magazines, as well as tailored canvas gun covers protecting the gun against mud during transport, had previously been issued in late 1917. The initial two-man Chauchat team was also found insufficient and eventually grew to a four-man squad by October 1917 (the squad leader, the gunner, the assistant gunner who handled the magazines plus one additional magazine carrier). Both the gunner and the assistant gunner carried at all times a .32 ACP Ruby pistol with three magazines, each one loaded with 9 rounds, as part of their regular equipment. The squad leader and the magazine carrier were both equipped with a rifle or with a Berthier carbine. While the additional men provided assistance in carrying loaded magazines, helping manage malfunctions, and protecting the gunner, it also negated one of the Chauchat's primary innovations: the ability to provide highly mobile automatic fire without the need for the 4-man team inherent to the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. French Chauchat gunner (left) and VB grenade launcher (right), 1918. By mid-1918, with mobility returning to the war and the end of the stalemate on the Western Front, the war had moved out of the mud of the trenches and into open fields, thus making the guns more reliable and easier to maintain. Furthermore, French infantry regiments had been reorganized into multiple small (18 men) combat groups (\\"Demi-Sections de Combat\\"). Those were made up of a full Chauchat squad plus four VB rifle grenade specialists and eight conventional grenadiers/riflemen. At this point in time, in 1918, the French regimental records and the statistics of medals given to Chauchat gunners document that they were an essential contribution to the success of these updated infantry tactics. Those were applied to suppress enemy machine gun nests by the combined action of Chauchat automatic fire coming from the sides and VB rifle grenades lobbed from the front, within less than 200 yards (182.9 meters). =WWI German use= A number of captured Chauchats were used by German front-line infantrymen in flamethrower units because they had no light machine guns of their own until the portable Maxim MG 08-15 light machine guns were issued to them during early 1917. The German army tried to modify some of these guns to fire 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge. =Belgian use= A Belgian machine gunner armed with a Chauchat, guarding a trench The Belgian Army, which held a large sector of the Western Front, acquired nearly 7,000 Chauchats for its infantry. About half of those Belgian Chauchats were successfully converted to fire their standard 7.65 mm Mauser ammunition and were also fitted with better protections against mud and dust. Post-war modified guns were designated FM 15/27. They were kept in service into the 1930s. =Serbian use= The Royal Serbian Army received at least 1,400 Chauchat between December 1916 and April 1917. Some were modified to fire 8mm Mauser. =Greek use= Greek soldiers with a Chauchat LMG (center) during the Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar, 1922. Chauchat entered service with Hellenic Army in 1917. The guns fired the 6.5√ó54mm Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer cartridge, stored in semi-circular magazine. Turkish National Movement forces used captured guns during the Greco-Turkish War. The Chauchat was still in frontline use during the Greco-Italian War. =Polish use= Poland received French military assistance, notably infantry weapons and artillery, after World War I. As a part of those French weaponry transfers, Poland received over 2,000 Chauchats, which they used extensively during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (1919‚Äì1921). After that war, Poland bought more of them, and their numbers reached 11,869, becoming a standard Polish light machine gun (the RKM wz 15). Eventually, about half of them were successfully converted during the mid-1920s to 7.92√ó57mm Mauser (or 8mm Mauser) and kept in service until the early 1930s under the designation RKM wz 15/27. One remaining specimen of these Polish Chauchats in 8mm Mauser is preserved and visible in the MoD (Ministry of Defence) National Firearms Center which is a part of the Royal Armouries in Leeds, Great Britain. Later, in 1936‚Äì1937, some 2,650 Chauchats were sold abroad by Poland, some to the Mexican Army, others to Republican Spain and also on the international surplus weapon market.Andrzej Konstankiewicz, Bro≈Ñ strzelecka i sprzƒôt artyleryjski formacji polskich i Wojska Polskiego w latach 1914‚Äì1939, Lublin 2003, =Finnish use= During the Winter War between Soviet Union and Finland, over 5,000 surplus Chauchats were donated by France to Finland, which was short on automatic weapons. The weapons arrived too late to see action but were used in Continuation War, mostly on the home front. After the war they were warehoused until 1955 and sold to Interarmco in 1959‚Äì1960. =WWII use= French third-line units that faced the German breakthrough during the Fall of France in May and June 1940 were still equipped with Chauchat machine guns. Nazi Germany seized Chauchats from Poland, Belgium, France, Greece and Yugoslavia. Ex-French guns were designated LeMG 156(f), ex-Yugoslav and ex-Polish LeMG 147(j), ex-Greek LeMG 156(g) and ex-Belgian LeMG 126(b). A small number of Chauchats captured by the Germans were issued to the Hungarians. =Other uses= The Chauchat saw service by Syria in the 1948 Arab-Israel war. Some remnants of the Chauchat machine rifle are reported to have appeared in Vietnam during the 1960s in the Vietnam War. Comparison US soldiers practicing marching fire, Fort Custer Training Center, 1919. The Chauchat was not comparable to the submachine guns of World War I, which used pistol, rather than rifle, ammunition and were thus less powerful. Compared to the Chauchat, the early submachine guns were used in relatively small numbers (thousands, rather than hundreds of thousands) and had much shorter effective ranges. Unlike much heavier air- and water-cooled machine guns (such as the Hotchkiss machine gun and the various belt-fed Maxim gun derivatives), and like the Madsen machine gun and Lewis gun, the Chauchat was not designed for sustained defensive fire from fixed positions. The tactical edge expected from the light and portable Chauchat machine rifle was to increase the offensive firepower of advancing infantry during the assaults. This particular tactic became known as marching fire. Colonel Chauchat had already formulated this tactical vision since the early 1900s, in his many proposals to the highest levels of the French military command structure, including General Joffre.

Crown Prince Carol of Romania firing a Chauchat Replacement After the Armistice of November 11, 1918, the French military decided to upgrade to a more reliable light squad automatic weapon that would be designed and manufactured nationally. Experimentation was carried out at the Manufacture d'Armes de Ch√¢tellerault during the early 1920s, culminating in the adoption of the new light machine gun (in French: fusil-mitrailleur), the FM Mle 1924. Gas- operated, and using a new 7.5 mm rimless cartridge (that would evolve into the 7.5x54mm French), this finally corrected all the problems associated with the Chauchat, and was manufactured in large numbers (232,000) and widely used by the French Army until the late 1950s.

Nuclear chemistry is the sub-field of chemistry dealing with radioactivity, nuclear processes, and transformations in the nuclei of atoms, such as nuclear transmutation and nuclear properties. It is the chemistry of radioactive elements such as the actinides, radium and radon together with the chemistry associated with equipment (such as nuclear reactors) which are designed to perform nuclear processes. This includes the corrosion of surfaces and the behavior under conditions of both normal and abnormal operation (such as during an accident). An important area is the behavior of objects and materials after being placed into a nuclear waste storage or disposal site. It includes the study of the chemical effects resulting from the absorption of radiation within living animals, plants, and other materials. The radiation chemistry controls much of radiation biology as radiation has an effect on living things at the molecular scale, to explain it another way the radiation alters the biochemicals within an organism, the alteration of the bio-molecules then changes the chemistry which occurs within the organism, this change in chemistry then can lead to a biological outcome. As a result, nuclear chemistry greatly assists the understanding of medical treatments (such as cancer radiotherapy) and has enabled these treatments to improve. It includes the study of the production and use of radioactive sources for a range of processes. These include radiotherapy in medical applications; the use of radioactive tracers within industry, science and the environment; and the use of radiation to modify materials such as polymers. It also includes the study and use of nuclear processes in non-radioactive areas of human activity. For instance, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is commonly used in synthetic organic chemistry and physical chemistry and for structural analysis in macro- molecular chemistry. Nuclear chemistry concerned with the study of nucleus, changes occurring in the nucleus, properties of the particles present in the nucleus and the emission or absorption of radiation from the nucleus History After Wilhelm R√∂ntgen discovered X-rays in 1882, many scientists began to work on ionizing radiation. One of these was Henri Becquerel, who investigated the relationship between phosphorescence and the blackening of photographic plates. When Becquerel (working in France) discovered that, with no external source of energy, the uranium generated rays which could blacken (or fog) the photographic plate, radioactivity was discovered. Marie Curie (working in Paris) and her husband Pierre Curie isolated two new radioactive elements from uranium ore. They used radiometric methods to identify which stream the radioactivity was in after each chemical separation; they separated the uranium ore into each of the different chemical elements that were known at the time, and measured the radioactivity of each fraction. They then attempted to separate these radioactive fractions further, to isolate a smaller fraction with a higher specific activity (radioactivity divided by mass). In this way, they isolated polonium and radium. It was noticed in about 1901 that high doses of radiation could cause an injury in humans. Henri Becquerel had carried a sample of radium in his pocket and as a result he suffered a highly localized dose which resulted in a radiation burn. This injury resulted in the biological properties of radiation being investigated, which in time resulted in the development of medical treatment Ernest Rutherford, working in Canada and England, showed that radioactive decay can be described by a simple equation (a linear first degree derivative equation, now called first order kinetics), implying that a given radioactive substance has a characteristic \\"half-life\\" (the time taken for the amount of radioactivity present in a source to diminish by half). He also coined the terms alpha, beta and gamma rays, he converted nitrogen into oxygen, and most importantly he supervised the students who did the Geiger‚ÄìMarsden experiment (gold foil experiment) which showed that the 'plum pudding model' of the atom was wrong. In the plum pudding model, proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904, the atom is composed of electrons surrounded by a 'cloud' of positive charge to balance the electrons' negative charge. To Rutherford, the gold foil experiment implied that the positive charge was confined to a very small nucleus leading first to the Rutherford model, and eventually to the Bohr model of the atom, where the positive nucleus is surrounded by the negative electrons. In 1934 Marie Curie's daughter (Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie) and son-in-law (Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie) were the first to create artificial radioactivity: they bombarded boron with alpha particles to make the neutron-poor isotope nitrogen-13; this isotope emitted positrons. In addition, they bombarded aluminium and magnesium with neutrons to make new radioisotopes. Main areas Radiochemistry is the chemistry of radioactive materials, in which radioactive isotopes of elements are used to study the properties and chemical reactions of non-radioactive isotopes (often within radiochemistry the absence of radioactivity leads to a substance being described as being inactive as the isotopes are stable). For further details please see the page on radiochemistry. =Radiation chemistry= Radiation chemistry is the study of the chemical effects of radiation on the matter; this is very different from radiochemistry as no radioactivity needs to be present in the material which is being chemically changed by the radiation. An example is the conversion of water into hydrogen gas and hydrogen peroxide. Prior to radiation chemistry, it was commonly believed that pure water could not be destroyed. Initial experiments were focused on understanding the effects of radiation on matter. Using a X-ray generator, Hugo Fricke studied the biological effects of radiation as it became a common treatment option and diagnostic method. Fricke proposed and subsequently proved that the energy from X - rays were able to convert water into activated water, allowing it to react with dissolved species. =Chemistry for nuclear power= Radiochemistry, radiation chemistry and nuclear chemical engineering play a very important role for uranium and thorium fuel precursors synthesis, starting from ores of these elements, fuel fabrication, coolant chemistry, fuel reprocessing, radioactive waste treatment and storage, monitoring of radioactive elements release during reactor operation and radioactive geological storage, etc. =Study of nuclear reactions= A combination of radiochemistry and radiation chemistry is used to study nuclear reactions such as fission and fusion. Some early evidence for nuclear fission was the formation of a short-lived radioisotope of barium which was isolated from neutron irradiated uranium (139Ba, with a half-life of 83 minutes and 140Ba, with a half-life of 12.8 days, are major fission products of uranium). At the time, it was thought that this was a new radium isotope, as it was then standard radiochemical practice to use a barium sulfate carrier precipitate to assist in the isolation of radium. More recently, a combination of radiochemical methods and nuclear physics has been used to try to make new 'superheavy' elements; it is thought that islands of relative stability exist where the nuclides have half-lives of years, thus enabling weighable amounts of the new elements to be isolated. For more details of the original discovery of nuclear fission see the work of Otto Hahn.Meitner L, Frisch OR (1939) Disintegration of uranium by neutrons: a new type of nuclear reaction Nature 143:239-240 = The nuclear fuel cycle = This is the chemistry associated with any part of the nuclear fuel cycle, including nuclear reprocessing. The fuel cycle includes all the operations involved in producing fuel, from mining, ore processing and enrichment to fuel production (Front-end of the cycle). It also includes the 'in-pile' behavior (use of the fuel in a reactor) before the back end of the cycle. The back end includes the management of the used nuclear fuel in either a spent fuel pool or dry storage, before it is disposed of into an underground waste store or reprocessed.  Normal and abnormal conditions  The nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas, one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (more rarely) an accident is occurring. Without this process, none of this would be true. Reprocessing =Law= In the United States, it is normal to use fuel once in a power reactor before placing it in a waste store. The long-term plan is currently to place the used civilian reactor fuel in a deep store. This non-reprocessing policy was started in March 1977 because of concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. President Jimmy Carter issued a Presidential directive which indefinitely suspended the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the United States. This directive was likely an attempt by the United States to lead other countries by example, but many other nations continue to reprocess spent nuclear fuels. The Russian government under President Vladimir Putin repealed a law which had banned the import of used nuclear fuel, which makes it possible for Russians to offer a reprocessing service for clients outside Russia (similar to that offered by BNFL). =PUREX chemistry= The current method of choice is to use the PUREX liquid-liquid extraction process which uses a tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon mixture to extract both uranium and plutonium from nitric acid. This extraction is of the nitrate salts and is classed as being of a solvation mechanism. For example, the extraction of plutonium by an extraction agent (S) in a nitrate medium occurs by the following reaction. :Pu4+aq \\\\+ 4NO3‚àíaq \\\\+ 2Sorganic -> [Pu(NO3)4S2]organic A complex bond is formed between the metal cation, the nitrates and the tributyl phosphate, and a model compound of a dioxouranium(VI) complex with two nitrates and two triethyl phosphates has been characterised by X-ray crystallography.J.H. Burns, \\"Solvent-extraction complexes of the uranyl ion. 2. Crystal and molecular structures of catena-bis(.mu.-di-n-butyl phosphato-O,O')dioxouranium(VI) and bis(.mu.-di-n-butyl phosphato-O,O')bis[(nitrato)(tri-n-butylphosphine oxide)dioxouranium(VI)]\\", Inorganic Chemistry, 1983, 22, 1174-1178 When the nitric acid concentration is high the extraction into the organic phase is favored, and when the nitric acid concentration is low the extraction is reversed (the organic phase is stripped of the metal). It is normal to dissolve the used fuel in nitric acid, after the removal of the insoluble matter the uranium and plutonium are extracted from the highly active liquor. It is normal to then back extract the loaded organic phase to create a medium active liquor which contains mostly uranium and plutonium with only small traces of fission products. This medium active aqueous mixture is then extracted again by tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon to form a new organic phase, the metal bearing organic phase is then stripped of the metals to form an aqueous mixture of only uranium and plutonium. The two stages of extraction are used to improve the purity of the actinide product, the organic phase used for the first extraction will suffer a far greater dose of radiation. The radiation can degrade the tributyl phosphate into dibutyl hydrogen phosphate. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can act as an extraction agent for both the actinides and other metals such as ruthenium. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can make the system behave in a more complex manner as it tends to extract metals by an ion exchange mechanism (extraction favoured by low acid concentration), to reduce the effect of the dibutyl hydrogen phosphate it is common for the used organic phase to be washed with sodium carbonate solution to remove the acidic degradation products of the tributyl phosphate. =New methods being considered for future use= The PUREX process can be modified to make a UREX (URanium EXtraction) process which could be used to save space inside high level nuclear waste disposal sites, such as Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, by removing the uranium which makes up the vast majority of the mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as reprocessed uranium. The UREX process is a PUREX process which has been modified to prevent the plutonium being extracted. This can be done by adding a plutonium reductant before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and >95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides. The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to the extraction and scrubs sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the PUREX process. Adding a second extraction agent, octyl(phenyl)-N,N-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide (CMPO) in combination with tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process can be turned into the TRUEX (TRansUranic EXtraction) process this is a process which was invented in the US by Argonne National Laboratory, and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. The idea is that by lowering the alpha activity of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism. As an alternative to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process has the advantage of avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain. The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism. Selective Actinide Extraction (SANEX). As part of the management of minor actinides, it has been proposed that the lanthanides and trivalent minor actinides should be removed from the PUREX raffinate by a process such as DIAMEX or TRUEX. In order to allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel the lanthanides must be removed. The lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron-driven nuclear reaction. To date, the extraction system for the SANEX process has not been defined, but currently, several different research groups are working towards a process. For instance, the French CEA is working on a bis-triazinyl pyridine (BTP) based process. Other systems such as the dithiophosphinic acids are being worked on by some other workers. This is the UNiversal EXtraction process which was developed in Russia and the Czech Republic, it is a process designed to remove all of the most troublesome (Sr, Cs and minor actinides) radioisotopes from the raffinates left after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. The chemistry is based upon the interaction of caesium and strontium with poly ethylene oxide (poly ethylene glycol) and a cobalt carborane anion (known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide). The actinides are extracted by CMPO, and the diluent is a polar aromatic such as nitrobenzene. Other dilents such as meta-nitrobenzotrifluoride and phenyl trifluoromethyl sulfone have been suggested as well. Absorption of fission products on surfaces Another important area of nuclear chemistry is the study of how fission products interact with surfaces; this is thought to control the rate of release and migration of fission products both from waste containers under normal conditions and from power reactors under accident conditions. Like chromate and molybdate, the 99TcO4 anion can react with steel surfaces to form a corrosion resistant layer. In this way, these metaloxo anions act as anodic corrosion inhibitors. The formation of 99TcO2 on steel surfaces is one effect which will retard the release of 99Tc from nuclear waste drums and nuclear equipment which has been lost before decontamination (e.g. submarine reactors lost at sea). This 99TcO2 layer renders the steel surface passive, inhibiting the anodic corrosion reaction. The radioactive nature of technetium makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. It has also been shown that 99TcO4 anions react to form a layer on the surface of activated carbon (charcoal) or aluminium.Decontamination of surfaces, George H. Goodall and Barry. E. Gillespie, United States Patent 4839100 A short review of the biochemical properties of a series of key long lived radioisotopes can be read on line. 99Tc in nuclear waste may exist in chemical forms other than the 99TcO4 anion, these other forms have different chemical properties. Similarly, the release of iodine-131 in a serious power reactor accident could be retarded by absorption on metal surfaces within the nuclear plant.Gl√§nneskog H (2004) Interactions of I2 and CH3I with reactive metals under BWR severe- accident conditions.

Now, with many experts in these fields approaching retirement age, action is needed to avoid a workforce gap in these critical fields, for example by building student interest in these careers, expanding the educational capacity of universities and colleges, and providing more specific on-the-job training. Nuclear and Radiochemistry (NRC) is mostly being taught at university level, usually first at the Master- and PhD-degree level. In Europe, as substantial effort is being done to harmonize and prepare the NRC education for the industry's and society's future needs. This effort is being coordinated in a project funded by the Coordinated Action supported by the European Atomic Energy Community's 7th Framework Program.This project has set up a wiki dedicated to NRC teaching, NucWik at Wikispaces. Although NucWik is primarily aimed at teachers, anyone interested in nuclear and radiochemistry is welcome and can find a lot of information and material explaining topics related to NRC. Spinout areas Some methods first developed within nuclear chemistry and physics have become so widely used within chemistry and other physical sciences that they may be best thought of as separate from normal nuclear chemistry. For example, the isotope effect is used so extensively to investigate chemical mechanisms and the use of cosmogenic isotopes and long-lived unstable isotopes in geology that it is best to consider much of isotopic chemistry as separate from nuclear chemistry. = Kinetics (use within mechanistic chemistry) = The mechanisms of chemical reactions can be investigated by observing how the kinetics of a reaction is changed by making an isotopic modification of a substrate, known as the kinetic isotope effect. This is now a standard method in organic chemistry. Briefly, replacing normal hydrogen (protons) by deuterium within a molecule causes the molecular vibrational frequency of X-H (for example C-H, N-H and O-H) bonds to decrease, which leads to a decrease in vibrational zero- point energy. This can lead to a decrease in the reaction rate if the rate- determining step involves breaking a bond between hydrogen and another atom.Peter Atkins and Julio de Paula, Atkins' Physical Chemistry, 8th edn (W.H. Freeman 2006), p.816-8 Thus, if the reaction changes in rate when protons are replaced by deuteriums, it is reasonable to assume that the breaking of the bond to hydrogen is part of the step which determines the rate. = Uses within geology, biology and forensic science = Cosmogenic isotopes are formed by the interaction of cosmic rays with the nucleus of an atom. These can be used for dating purposes and for use as natural tracers. In addition, by careful measurement of some ratios of stable isotopes it is possible to obtain new insights into the origin of bullets, ages of ice samples, ages of rocks, and the diet of a person can be identified from a hair or other tissue sample. (See Isotope geochemistry and Isotopic signature for further details).  Biology  Within living things, isotopic labels (both radioactive and nonradioactive) can be used to probe how the complex web of reactions which makes up the metabolism of an organism converts one substance to another. For instance a green plant uses light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose by photosynthesis. If the oxygen in the water is labeled, then the label appears in the oxygen gas formed by the plant and not in the glucose formed in the chloroplasts within the plant cells. For biochemical and physiological experiments and medical methods, a number of specific isotopes have important applications. *Stable isotopes have the advantage of not delivering a radiation dose to the system being studied; however, a significant excess of them in the organ or organism might still interfere with its functionality, and the availability of sufficient amounts for whole-animal studies is limited for many isotopes. Measurement is also difficult, and usually requires mass spectrometry to determine how much of the isotope is present in particular compounds, and there is no means of localizing measurements within the cell. *2H (deuterium), the stable isotope of hydrogen, is a stable tracer, the concentration of which can be measured by mass spectrometry or NMR. It is incorporated into all cellular structures. Specific deuterated compounds can also be produced. *15N, a stable isotope of nitrogen, has also been used. It is incorporated mainly into proteins. *Radioactive isotopes have the advantages of being detectable in very low quantities, in being easily measured by scintillation counting or other radiochemical methods, and in being localizable to particular regions of a cell, and quantifiable by autoradiography. Many compounds with the radioactive atoms in specific positions can be prepared, and are widely available commercially. In high quantities they require precautions to guard the workers from the effects of radiation‚Äîand they can easily contaminate laboratory glassware and other equipment. For some isotopes the half-life is so short that preparation and measurement is difficult. By organic synthesis it is possible to create a complex molecule with a radioactive label that can be confined to a small area of the molecule. For short-lived isotopes such as 11C, very rapid synthetic methods have been developed to permit the rapid addition of the radioactive isotope to the molecule. For instance a palladium catalysed carbonylation reaction in a microfluidic device has been used to rapidly form amidesMiller PW et al. (2006) Chemical Communications 546-548 and it might be possible to use this method to form radioactive imaging agents for PET imaging. *3H (tritium), the radioisotope of hydrogen, is available at very high specific activities, and compounds with this isotope in particular positions are easily prepared by standard chemical reactions such as hydrogenation of unsaturated precursors. The isotope emits very soft beta radiation, and can be detected by scintillation counting. *11C, carbon-11 is usually produced by cyclotron bombardment of 14N with protons. The resulting nuclear reaction is 14N(p,Œ±)11C. Additionally, carbon-11 can also be made using a cyclotron; boron in the form of boric oxide is reacted with protons in a (p,n) reaction. Another alternative route is to react 10B with deuterons. By rapid organic synthesis, the 11C compound formed in the cyclotron is converted into the imaging agent which is then used for PET. *14C, carbon-14 can be made (as above), and it is possible to convert the target material into simple inorganic and organic compounds. In most organic synthesis work it is normal to try to create a product out of two approximately equal sized fragments and to use a convergent route, but when a radioactive label is added, it is normal to try to add the label late in the synthesis in the form of a very small fragment to the molecule to enable the radioactivity to be localised in a single group. Late addition of the label also reduces the number of synthetic stages where radioactive material is used. *18F, fluorine-18 can be made by the reaction of neon with deuterons, 20Ne reacts in a (d,4He) reaction. It is normal to use neon gas with a trace of stable fluorine (19F2). The 19F2 acts as a carrier which increases the yield of radioactivity from the cyclotron target by reducing the amount of radioactivity lost by absorption on surfaces. However, this reduction in loss is at the cost of the specific activity of the final product. = Nuclear spectroscopy = Nuclear spectroscopy are methods that use the nucleus to obtain information of the local structure in matter. Important methods are NMR (see below), M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy and Perturbed angular correlation. These methods use the interaction of the hyperfine field with the nucleus' spin. The field can be magnetic or/and electric and are created by the electrons of the atom and its sourrounding neighbours. Thus, these methods investigate the local structure in matter, mainly condensed matter in condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  NMR spectroscopy uses the net spin of nuclei in a substance upon energy absorption to identify molecules. This has now become a standard spectroscopic tool within synthetic chemistry. One major use of NMR is to determine the bond connectivity within an organic molecule. NMR imaging also uses the net spin of nuclei (commonly protons) for imaging. This is widely used for diagnostic purposes in medicine, and can provide detailed images of the inside of a person without inflicting any radiation upon them. In a medical setting, NMR is often known simply as \\"magnetic resonance\\" imaging, as the word 'nuclear' has negative connotations for many people.

This process is slow. Wood combustion has a high reaction rate. This process is fast. The reaction rate or rate of reaction is the speed at which a chemical reaction takes place. Reaction rate is defined as the speed at which reactants are converted into products. Reaction rates can vary dramatically. For example, the oxidative rusting of iron under Earth's atmosphere is a slow reaction that can take many years, but the combustion of cellulose in a fire is a reaction that takes place in fractions of a second. For most reactions, the rate decreases as the reaction proceeds. Chemical kinetics is the part of physical chemistry that studies reaction rates. The concepts of chemical kinetics are applied in many disciplines, such as chemical engineering, enzymology and environmental engineering. Formal definition Consider a typical chemical reaction: :{\\\\mathit{a}A} + {\\\\mathit{b}B} -> {\\\\mathit{p}P} + {\\\\mathit{q}Q} The lowercase letters (a, b, p, and q) represent stoichiometric coefficients, while the capital letters represent the reactants (A and B) and the products (P and Q). According to IUPAC's Gold Book definition the reaction rate v for a chemical reaction occurring in a closed system under isochoric conditions, without a build-up of reaction intermediates, is defined as: :v = - \\\\frac{1}{a} \\\\frac{d[\\\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = - \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\frac{d[\\\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = \\\\frac{1}{p} \\\\frac{d[\\\\mathrm{P}]}{dt} = \\\\frac{1}{q} \\\\frac{d[\\\\mathrm{Q}]}{dt} where [X] denotes the concentration of the substance X (= A, B, P or Q). Reaction rate thus defined has the units of mol/L/s. The rate of a reaction is always positive. A negative sign is present to indicate that the reactant concentration is decreasing. The IUPAC recommends that the unit of time should always be the second. The rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its stoichiometric number) and for a reactant A by minus the reciprocal of the stoichiometric number. The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3 then B is consumed three times more rapidly than A, but v = -d[A]/dt = -(1/3)d[B]/dt is uniquely defined. An additional advantage of this definition is that for an elementary and irreversible reaction, v is equal to the product of probability of overcoming the transition state activation energy and the number of times per second the transition state is approached by reactant molecules. When so defined, for an elementary and irreversible reaction, v is the rate of successful chemical reaction events leading to the product. The above definition is only valid for a single reaction, in a closed system of constant volume, an assumption which should be stated explicitly in the definition. If water is added to a pot containing salty water, the concentration of salt decreases, although there is no chemical reaction. For an open system, the full mass balance must be taken into account: :F_{\\\\mathrm{A}0} - F_\\\\mathrm{A} + \\\\int_{0}^{V} v\\\\, dV = \\\\frac{dN_\\\\mathrm{A}}{dt}, where FA0 is the inflow rate of A in molecules per second, FA the outflow, and v is the instantaneous reaction rate of A (in number concentration rather than molar) in a given differential volume, integrated over the entire system volume V at a given moment. When applied to the closed system at constant volume considered previously, this equation reduces to: :v= \\\\frac{d[A]}{dt}, where the concentration [A] is related to the number of molecules NA by [A] = . Here N0 is the Avogadro constant. For a single reaction in a closed system of varying volume the so-called rate of conversion can be used, in order to avoid handling concentrations. It is defined as the derivative of the extent of reaction with respect to time. :v =\\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{dt} = \\\\frac{1}{ u_i} \\\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\\\frac{1}{ u_i} \\\\frac{d(C_i V)}{dt} = \\\\frac{1}{ u_i} \\\\left(V\\\\frac{dC_i}{dt} + C_i \\\\frac{dV}{dt} \\\\right) Here ŒΩi is the stoichiometric coefficient for substance i, equal to a, b, p, and q in the typical reaction above. Also V is the volume of reaction and Ci is the concentration of substance i. When side products or reaction intermediates are formed, the IUPAC recommends the use of the terms the rate of increase of concentration and rate of the decrease of concentration for products and reactants, properly. Reaction rates may also be defined on a basis that is not the volume of the reactor. When a catalyst is used the reaction rate may be stated on a catalyst weight (mol g‚àí1 s‚àí1) or surface area (mol m‚àí2 s‚àí1) basis. If the basis is a specific catalyst site that may be rigorously counted by a specified method, the rate is given in units of s‚àí1 and is called a turnover frequency. Influencing factors Factors that influence the reaction rate are the nature of the reaction, concentration, pressure, reaction order, temperature, solvent, electromagnetic radiation, catalyst, isotopes, surface area, stirring, and diffusion limit. Some reactions are naturally faster than others. The number of reacting species, their physical state (the particles that form solids move much more slowly than those of gases or those in solution), the complexity of the reaction and other factors can greatly influence the rate of a reaction. Reaction rate increases with concentration, as described by the rate law and explained by collision theory. As reactant concentration increases, the frequency of collision increases. The rate of gaseous reactions increases with pressure, which is, in fact, equivalent to an increase in concentration of the gas. The reaction rate increases in the direction where there are fewer moles of gas and decreases in the reverse direction. For condensed-phase reactions, the pressure dependence is weak. The order of the reaction controls how the reactant concentration (or pressure) affects reaction rate. Usually conducting a reaction at a higher temperature delivers more energy into the system and increases the reaction rate by causing more collisions between particles, as explained by collision theory. However, the main reason that temperature increases the rate of reaction is that more of the colliding particles will have the necessary activation energy resulting in more successful collisions (when bonds are formed between reactants). The influence of temperature is described by the Arrhenius equation. For example, coal burns in a fireplace in the presence of oxygen, but it does not when it is stored at room temperature. The reaction is spontaneous at low and high temperatures but at room temperature its rate is so slow that it is negligible. The increase in temperature, as created by a match, allows the reaction to start and then it heats itself, because it is exothermic. That is valid for many other fuels, such as methane, butane, and hydrogen. Reaction rates can be independent of temperature (non-Arrhenius) or decrease with increasing temperature (anti- Arrhenius). Reactions without an activation barrier (e.g., some radical reactions), tend to have anti Arrhenius temperature dependence: the rate constant decreases with increasing temperature. Many reactions take place in solution and the properties of the solvent affect the reaction rate. The ionic strength also has an effect on reaction rate. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy. As such, it may speed up the rate or even make a reaction spontaneous as it provides the particles of the reactants with more energy. This energy is in one way or another stored in the reacting particles (it may break bonds, promote molecules to electronically or vibrationally excited states...) creating intermediate species that react easily. As the intensity of light increases, the particles absorb more energy and hence the rate of reaction increases. For example, when methane reacts with chlorine in the dark, the reaction rate is slow. It can be sped up when the mixture is put under diffused light. In bright sunlight, the reaction is explosive. The presence of a catalyst increases the reaction rate (in both the forward and reverse reactions) by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. For example, platinum catalyzes the combustion of hydrogen with oxygen at room temperature. The kinetic isotope effect consists in a different reaction rate for the same molecule if it has different isotopes, usually hydrogen isotopes, because of the relative mass difference between hydrogen and deuterium. In reactions on surfaces, which take place for example during heterogeneous catalysis, the rate of reaction increases as the surface area does. That is because more particles of the solid are exposed and can be hit by reactant molecules. Stirring can have a strong effect on the rate of reaction for heterogeneous reactions. Some reactions are limited by diffusion. All the factors that affect a reaction rate, except for concentration and reaction order, are taken into account in the reaction rate coefficient (the coefficient in the rate equation of the reaction). Rate equation For a chemical reaction a A + b B ‚Üí p P + q Q, the rate equation or rate law is a mathematical expression used in chemical kinetics to link the rate of a reaction to the concentration of each reactant. For a closed system at constant volume, this is often of the form :\\\\,v = k [\\\\mathrm{A}]^{n}[\\\\mathrm{B}]^{m} - k_r[\\\\mathrm{P}]^{i}[\\\\mathrm{Q}]^{j} For reactions that go to completion (which implies very small kr), or if only the initial rate is analyzed (with initial vanishing product concentrations), this simplifies to the commonly quoted form :\\\\,v = k(T)[\\\\mathrm{A}]^{n}[\\\\mathrm{B}]^{m} For gas phase reaction the rate equation is often alternatively expressed in terms of partial pressures. In these equations k(T) is the reaction rate coefficient or rate constant, although it is not really a constant, because it includes all the parameters that affect reaction rate, except for time and concentration. Of all the parameters influencing reaction rates, temperature is normally the most important one and is accounted for by the Arrhenius equation. The exponents n and m are called reaction orders and depend on the reaction mechanism. For an elementary (single-step) reaction, the order with respect to each reactant is equal to its stoichiometric coefficient. For complex (multistep) reactions, however, this is often not true and the rate equation is determined by the detailed mechanism, as illustrated below for the reaction of H2 and NO. For elementary reactions or reaction steps, the order and stoichiometric coefficient are both equal to the molecularity or number of molecules participating. For a unimolecular reaction or step the rate is proportional to the concentration of molecules of reactant, so that the rate law is first order. For a bimolecular reaction or step, the number of collisions is proportional to the product of the two reactant concentrations, or second order. A termolecular step is predicted to be third order, but also very slow as simultaneous collisions of three molecules are rare. By using the mass balance for the system in which the reaction occurs, an expression for the rate of change in concentration can be derived. For a closed system with constant volume, such an expression can look like :\\\\frac{d[\\\\mathrm{P}]}{dt} = k(T)[\\\\mathrm{A}]^{n}[\\\\mathrm{B}]^{m} =Example of a complex reaction: hydrogen and nitric oxide= For the reaction :2H2(g) + 2NO(g) -> N2(g) + 2H2O(g) the observed rate equation (or rate expression) is: v = k [\\\\ce{H2}] [\\\\ce{NO}]^2 \\\\, As for many reactions, the experimental rate equation does not simply reflect the stoichiometric coefficients in the overall reaction: It is third order overall: first order in H2 and second order in NO, even though the stoichiometric coefficients of both reactants are equal to 2. In chemical kinetics, the overall reaction rate is often explained using a mechanism consisting of a number of elementary steps. Not all of these steps affect the rate of reaction; normally the slowest elementary step controls the reaction rate. For this example, a possible mechanism is: # \\\\quad 2NO(g) <=> N2O2(g) \\\\qquad(fast\\\\ equilibrium) # \\\\quad {N2O2} + H2 -> {N2O} + H2O \\\\qquad(slow) # \\\\quad {N2O} + H2 ->{N2} + H2O\\\\qquad(fast) Reactions 1 and 3 are very rapid compared to the second, so the slow reaction 2 is the rate determining step. This is a bimolecular elementary reaction whose rate is given by the second order equation: : v = k_2 [\\\\ce{H2}] [\\\\ce{N2O2}] \\\\,, where k2 is the rate constant for the second step. However N2O2 is an unstable intermediate whose concentration is determined by the fact that the first step is in equilibrium, so that , where K1 is the equilibrium constant of the first step. Substitution of this equation in the previous equation leads to a rate equation expressed in terms of the original reactants : v = k_2 K_1 [\\\\ce{H2}] [\\\\ce{NO}]^2 \\\\, This agrees with the form of the observed rate equation if it is assumed that . In practice the rate equation is used to suggest possible mechanisms which predict a rate equation in agreement with experiment. The second molecule of H2 does not appear in the rate equation because it reacts in the third step, which is a rapid step after the rate-determining step, so that it does not affect the overall reaction rate. Temperature dependence Each reaction rate coefficient k has a temperature dependency, which is usually given by the Arrhenius equation: : k = A e^{ - \\\\frac{E_\\\\mathrm{a}}{RT} } Ea is the activation energy and R is the gas constant. Since at temperature T the molecules have energies given by a Boltzmann distribution, one can expect the number of collisions with energy greater than Ea to be proportional to e. A is the pre-exponential factor or frequency factor. The values for A and Ea are dependent on the reaction. There are also more complex equations possible, which describe temperature dependence of other rate constants that do not follow this pattern. Temperature Is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the reactants. As temperature increases this makes the kinetic energy of the reactants increase too meaning they move faster. With the reactants moving faster this allows more collisions to take place at a greater speed so the chance of reactants forming into products increases which in turn results in the rate of reaction increasing. A rise in 10 degrees Celsius results in around double the reaction rate. The minimum kinetic energy required for a reaction to occur is called the activation energy and this is denoted by Ea. The activated complex shown on the diagram below is the energy barrier that must be overcome when changing reactants into products. On an energy distribution graph we can see which molecules have enough energy to react. The molecules past the dotted line have a greater or equal energy level to the activation energy and so can react For a successful collision to take place the collision geometry must be right meaning the reactant molecules have to be facing the right way so that the activated complex can be formed. A chemical reaction takes place only when the reacting particles collide. However, not all collisions are effective in causing the reaction. Products are formed only when the colliding particles possess a certain minimum energy called threshold energy. As a rule of thumb, reaction rates for many reactions double for every 10 degrees Celsius increase in temperature, For a given reaction, the ratio of its rate constant at a higher temperature to its rate constant at a lower temperature is known as its temperature coefficient (Q). Q10 is commonly used as the ratio of rate constants that are 10 ¬∞C apart. Pressure dependence The pressure dependence of the rate constant for condensed-phase reactions (i.e., when reactants and products are solids or liquid) is usually sufficiently weak in the range of pressures normally encountered in industry that it is neglected in practice. The pressure dependence of the rate constant is associated with the activation volume. For the reaction proceeding through an activation-state complex: :A + B A‚ãØB‚Ä° ‚Üí P the activation volume, ŒîV‚Ä°, is: :\\\\Delta V^{\\\\ddagger} = \\\\bar{V}_{\\\\ddagger} - \\\\bar{V}_\\\\mathrm{A} - \\\\bar{V}_\\\\mathrm{B} where VÃÑ denotes the partial molar volume of a species and ‚Ä° indicates the activation-state complex. For the above reaction, one can expect the change of the reaction rate constant (based either on mole fraction or on molar concentration) with pressure at constant temperature to be: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ln k_x}{\\\\partial P} \\\\right)_T = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V^{\\\\ddagger}} {RT} In practice, the matter can be complicated because the partial molar volumes and the activation volume can themselves be a function of pressure. Reactions can increase or decrease their rates with pressure, depending on the value of ŒîV‚Ä°. As an example of the possible magnitude of the pressure effect, some organic reactions were shown to double the reaction rate when the pressure was increased from atmospheric (0.1 MPa) to 50 MPa (which gives ŒîV‚Ä° = ‚àí0.025 L/mol).

It is situated northeast of Ocala and lies between the towns of Sparr and Eureka on County Road 316 and is directly north of Silver Springs on County Road 315. The community is part of the Ocala Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Fort McCoy is located at . The community is located west of the Ocala National Forest. History Fort McCoy was originally named Fort Mackay. MacKay and MacCoy were both settlers in the area who were killed by Indians during the war. The town of Fort McCoy is named after the settler Jeb MacCoy but spelled differently. When hostilities with Native Americans worsened, Jeb MacCoy was killed by Indians while bringing his family into Fort Russell. Captain Mackay was head of the local militia, and was killed while surveying Itonia Scrub on March 20, 1839. Education The first school in Fort McCoy was supposedly a log cabin that was built near the fort; and it is thought to have been abandoned during the Second Seminole War. When the Union Church was built near the Fort McCoy Cemetery, it was used as the school, with church services on the weekends. Sometime between the 1890s and the first decade of the 1900s, a wooden building was built to serve as the school. In 1935, this building was destroyed in a fire. A small new school (to serve the approximate 75 pupils at the time) was built on the land donated by Dr Percy F. Lisk, which was right in front of the old schools location. The new brick school opened in 1936. The earliest known student grade levels are from the 1940s, when the school was known as Fort McCoy High School. Fort McCoy High School was closed in 1963 and re-opened soon after as Fort McCoy Elementary School. The population of Fort McCoy increased over the years, and by the 1980s the property was a vast land full of \\"portable classrooms\\". Due to the population increase and age of the building (50 years old), the Marion County School Board decided to have a new school built in 1986. The original brick building became the Fort McCoy Public Library in 1996, after a $60,000 renovation. In 1988, the new campus opened, renamed as Fort McCoy School, which now served elementary and middle school students (Pre-K to Eighth grade). That campus is still being used today, as well as the same grade levels being served. Most kids from kindergarten through eighth grade attend Fort McCoy School. Most high school students in Fort McCoy attend North Marion High School, while some attend Lake Weir High School.

Released by RKO Radio Pictures on April 18, 1953, the short is notable as the final regular entry in the Mickey Mouse theatrical cartoon series. Following this short, one-shot Mickey shorts were produced: the featurettes Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983) and The Prince and the Pauper (1990), and the shorts Runaway Brain (1995), and Get a Horse! (2013). Plot At the start of the cartoon, Mickey is seen whistling to the tune of the song \\"The Simple Things‚Äù while walking along a rocky seashore, fishing gear in hand. Pluto, sniffing behind him, spots a mussel as he tries to cover up miniature geysers along the way. The mussel then squirts water at him. Pluto barks at the mussel and the mussel barks back. The mussel gets trapped on Pluto's tail after they fight. He pulls the mussel up and attempts to shove it off his tail but instead he pulls the mussel up and down like a yo-yo. The mussel accidentally gets stuck in his mouth. Pluto then rushes to Mickey for assistance. At first Mickey thinks that Pluto is asking for food and feeds him a hot dog. The mussel then steals Mickey's sandwich and a full pepper shaker which causes the mussel to sneeze thus freeing itself from Pluto's mouth. The mussel bounces around sneezing and wakes up a seagull that decides to eat the mussel. The sneezing mussel escapes the seagull by entering the sea. The hungry seagull steals the hot dog that Mickey is feeding Pluto instead. The seagull then sets his sights on the fish bait Mickey is using and unsuccessfully attempts to steal the fish while the line is being cast. Dejected but determined, the seagull then sits on top of Mickey's hat and easily steals the fish as he is baiting the hook until Mickey shoos the seagull away. He then floats under the hat to the other bait bucket and again eats the fish until Pluto notices and shoos him away and the seagull by tying up Pluto using his own tail and ears. Mickey again catches the seagull in his bait and after the bird tries to fly away carrying the bait, Mickey throws a rock in it which weighs it down. To overcome this, the seagull spells out \\"FREE FRESH FISH\\" using flag semaphore to get the other seagulls to chase Mickey and Pluto away. The short ends with the seagull floating away with his portable radio and fish in his mouth singing the song \\"The Simple Things\\".

He first appeared in the 1950 Goofy cartoon Hold That Pose, in which Goofy tried to take his picture. After that he appeared in four classic Donald Duck cartoons: Rugged Bear (1953), Grin and Bear It (1954), Bearly Asleep (1955), and Beezy Bear (1955). Disney gave him his own series in 1955, but only two films resulted (Hooked Bear and In the Bag, both 1956) before Disney discontinued making theatrical short subjects. When the shorts division closed, Humphrey was the last of only seven Disney characters who had been given a series of their own, starring in cartoons who opened with their own logo (the six others were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n' Dale (counting as one), and Figaro). The Humphrey cartoons feature a broader, wilder style of comedy than the usually cute or coy Disney gags; critic Leonard Maltin described them as \\"belly-laugh comedies that can hold their own against the best of MGM and Warner Brothers.\\" Development The bear that would become Humphrey first appeared in the 1950 Goofy cartoon Hold That Pose! Three years later, Donald Duck series animator Jack Hannah revived the ursine character: Personality Humphrey is a big, opportunistic, neurotic brown bear who lives in Brownstone National Park. He is constantly trying different ways to catch food and/or shelter from unsuspecting visitors, often violating the park rules in the process. However, his habit of fulfilling his wants/needs in this manner is not entirely unjustified, as it is often shown that he is seldom rewarded when he follows the rules. Unlike most Disney characters, Humphrey does not speak, but instead makes an assortment of inarticulate sounds to convey his emotions; those grunts were supplied by Disney staffer Jimmy MacDonald. When stricken by worry or panic, Humphrey runs desperately in place, with his feet seemingly headed in all directions. Humphrey's foil is most often Donald Duck, one of his antagonists; otherwise it is typically an officious park ranger voiced by Bill Thompson. The ranger's name was never identified in the theatrical shorts, but when the films were re-edited into an hour-long Disney TV episode, he was referred to as J. Audubon Woodlore. Popularity The films were popular in theaters, and the character was familiar enough to be included in the Mickey Mouse Club opening (Humphrey is one of the characters who holds the trampoline that bounces Mickey Mouse in the air). Later appearances Although the series Humphrey starred in enjoyed only a short run, a later generation of Disney artists and directors remembered Humphrey fondly, and cast him in episodes of Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Goof Troop, Mickey Mouse Works, House of Mouse, and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Humphrey returned to the screen in three new shorts: Donald's Grizzly Guest and Donald's Fish Fry reunite Humphrey with Donald Duck, and in Hot Tub Humphrey Humphrey is once again in the title role, alongside Ranger Woodlore. In these appearances, his vocals alternated between Frank Welker and Jim Cummings. Due to adding Humphrey to these Disney programs he became a more current character and can be seen in more Disney-related merchandise such as watches, cards, pins, T-shirts, and posters. More recently, he has returned in the series Legend of the Three Caballeros, where he is re-imagined as a bear rug reanimated by the spark of life. He later made a cameo in Ralph Breaks the Internet, where he is seen doing a dance and picking up trash on the floor in the background.

Strobl also drew comic stories with Humphrey for the market outside of the US, most of them also featuring Grandma Duck. Ed Nofziger wrote scripts for many foreign market stories with Humphrey. Most of those ones were drawn by cartoonists of the Argentinian art studio Jaime Diaz Studio. Popular culture Jack Hannah, who directed the 1950s Humphrey shorts, revived the \\"dumb bear\\" idea for Walter Lantz's \\"Fatso the Bear\\" cartoons in 1960 and 1961. It would also seem probable that the Hanna-Barbera animation studio was somewhat inspired by Humphrey in its creation of the somewhat smarter Yogi Bear (from 1958), who lives at Jellystone Park, begs, steals, and plays tricks to steal picnic baskets from campers, and is constantly on the lookout for Ranger Smith. Humphrey is currently the spokescharacter for Disney's Wilderness Lodge Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida. He is featured on the totem pole in the lobby along with Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy. His merchandise is featured in the Briar Patch in the Magic Kingdom.

Each financial institution sets the terms and conditions for each type of account it offers, which are classified in commonly understood types, such as deposit accounts, credit card accounts, current accounts, loan accounts or many other types of account. A customer may have more than one account. Once an account is opened, funds entrusted by the customer to the financial institution on deposit are recorded in the account designated by the customer. Funds can be withdrawn from loan accounts. The financial transactions which have occurred on a bank account within a given period of time are reported to the customer on a bank statement, and the balance of the accounts of a customer at any point in time is their financial position with the institution. Nature of a bank account In most legal systems, a deposit of funds in a bank is not a bailment - that is, the actual funds deposited by a person in a bank cease to be the property of the depositor and become the property of the bank. The depositor acquires a claim against the bank for the sum deposited but not to the actual cash handed over to the bank. In accounting terms, the bank creates (‚Äúopens‚Äù) an account in the name of the depositor or a name directed by the depositor in which the amount received by it is recorded as a transaction. The deposit account is a liability of the bank and an asset of the depositor (the account holder). On the other hand, a bank can lend some or all of the money it has on deposit to a third party/s. Such accounts, generally called loan or credit accounts, are subject to similar but reverse principles of a deposit account. In accounting terms, a loan account is an asset of the bank and a liability of the borrower. Loan accounts may be unsecured or secured by the borrower, and they may be guaranteed by a third person, with or without security. Opening an account Each financial institution sets the terms and conditions for each type of account it offers, and when a customer applies for the opening of an account, and accepted by the institution, they form the contract between the financial institution and the customer in relation to the account. The laws of each country specify how bank accounts may be opened and operated. They may specify who may open an account, for example, how the signatories can identify themselves, deposit, withdrawal limits among other specifications. The minimum age for opening a bank account is most commonly 18 years of age. However, in some countries, the minimum age to open a bank account can be 16 years, and accounts may be opened in the name of minors but operated by their parent or guardian. In general, it is unlawful to open an account in a false name.  Account structure  From the customer‚Äôs point of view, bank accounts may have a positive, or credit balance, when the financial institution owes money to the customer; or a negative, or debit balance, when the customer owes the financial institution money. Broadly, accounts that hold credit balances are referred to as deposit accounts, and accounts opened to hold debit balances are referred to as loan accounts. Some accounts can switch between credit and debit balances. Some accounts are categorized by the function rather than nature of the balance they hold, such as savings account, which routinely are in credit. Financial institutions have an account numbering scheme to identify each account, which is important as a customer may have multiple accounts. Types of accounts Each financial institution has its own names for the various accounts it offers to customers, but these can be categorised as:  See also  * Bank card number * Banking in Switzerland * Bank secrecy * Bank statement * Chart of accounts * Financial privacy * International Bank Account Number * Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication * International Organization for Standardization ** ISO 639 ** ISO 3166 ** ISO/IEC 7064 ** ISO/IEC 7812 ** ISO 9362 ** ISO 13616 ** ISO 15924 * Money laundering * Telephone banking  References  Banking ","title":"Bank account"},{"id":"242026","text":"Hardee's Restaurants LLC, is an American fast-food restaurant chain operated by CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc. (\\"CKE\\") with locations primarily in the Southern and Midwestern United States. The company has evolved through several corporate ownerships since its establishment in 1960 in North Carolina. In April 1997, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr., paid $327 million to Montreal-based Imasco Limited for Hardee's. The merger created a chain of 3,828 restaurants ‚Äì 3,152 Hardee's outlets in 40 states and 10 foreign countries and 676 Carl's Jr. outlets, primarily in California. In June 2018, CKE CEO former Jason Marker announced that Carl's Jr. and Hardee's would become separate brands, claiming that CKE's racy advertising and marketing campaigns were incompatible with a family-oriented chain like Hardee's.\\"Hardee's, Carl's Jr. chains part ways in fast-food image shakeup.\\" USA Today. 2018-06-19. Retrieved 2018-03-07. In April 2019 Ned Lyerly, a 30-year veteran of the company & formerly President of CKE's International division, was named CEO replacing Jason Marker. History First Hardee's franchise, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, 1980s A Hardee's in Salem, Virginia Hardee's founder, Wilber Hardee, opened his first restaurant in Greenville, North Carolina, on September 3, 1960. After a year of success, Wilber decided to look into expanding his restaurant and opening another location so he met with James Gardner and Leonard Rawls to discuss doing so. Shortly thereafter, the first company store was opened in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in May 1961 by James Carson Gardner and Leonard Rawls on McDonald Street on North Church Street in Rocky Mount, known within the chain as building number 1. That location was demolished in 2007 and replaced with a veterans' park named for Jack Laughery, a former Hardee's chairman and military veteran. According to Wilbur Hardee, Gardner and Rawls won a controlling share of the company from him during a game of poker. After realizing that he had lost control over his namesake company, Hardee sold his remaining shares to them as well. However, this story has been disputed by Gardner & Rawls, who bought out Wilbur Hardee and began establishing franchises in 1961. \\"Leonard put together an organization with relatively little capital. If it weren't for him and Jim Gardner, there wouldn't be anything of Hardee's Food Systems.\\" - Jack Laughery (CEO of Hardee's from 1975 to 1990). Source: Hardee's Horizon quarterly publication December, 1982. Rawls and Gardner sold their first franchises to a small group of longtime friends and acquaintances who formed their own companies and over time, built hundreds more franchised locations. Hardee's Food Systems went public in 1963 with Rawls as president. Gardner, who was vice president, had political ambitions and left the company when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1966. The 1964 menu included: hamburger-15 cents, cheeseburger-20 cents, fries-10 cents, apple turnovers-15 cents, milk-12 cents, coffee-10 cents, Coke, Pepsi, root beer and orange soda-15 cents and 10 cents, and milkshakes (chocolate-strawberry- vanilla)-20 cents. Strawberry shakes were created from vanilla by addition of a berry syrup which had to be mixed with a spindle. At the end of the 1960s, the corporation operated nearly 200 restaurants in the Midwest and Southwestern U.S., as well as its first international locations in Germany. Around this same time, Hardee's began an expansion into the mid-Atlantic states, notably Southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. The expansion was done via the franchisee Hardee Northern, Inc, which was a subsidiary of Acme Markets, a prominent grocery store chain based in Philadelphia. Hardee's purchased Sandy's in 1972 with the last of the restaurants converting to Hardee's by 1979. During the mid-and-late 1970s, Hardee's saw rapid chain growth and high profits on the strength of its two key sandwiches: the \\"Big Twin\\" and the \\"Big Deluxe\\". Another acquisition occurred in the late 1970s when Hardee's purchased the Utah-based burger chain Dee's Drive-In. Hardee's logo, 1976‚Äì1999. Revived as part of a marketing campaign in 2018, alongside the current \\"Happy Star\\" logo. Hardee's was purchased by Canadian company Imasco Limited in 1981. In 1982, General Foods sold Burger Chef to Imasco for $44 million. Imasco converted many locations to Hardee's restaurants and let franchises and locations near existing Hardee's locations convert to other brands. Remaining restaurants that did not convert to Hardee's or new names and branding simply closed. A new management team, in the early 1980s, seeking to cut costs, changed the signature burger recipe and eliminated the flagship menu item, the Big Twin. The Big Deluxe continued to be offered throughout the 1990s. For a few years after acquiring the Roy Rogers Restaurants fast food chain in the early 1990s, Hardee's outlets sold the popular Roy Rogers Restaurant fried chicken recipe, hoping it could compete with KFC. In addition to Roy Rogers, Hardee's also owned Rax Roast Beef for a period of time and sold roast beef sandwiches throughout the Hardee's system. In April 1997, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr., bought Hardee's from Imasco for $327 million. The merger created a chain of 3,828 restaurants ‚Äì 3,152 Hardee's outlets in 40 states and 10 foreign countries and 676 Carl's Jr. outlets primarily in California. In 2001, Hardee's headquarters moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In 2005, Hardee's introduced Hand-Scooped Ice Cream Shakes & Malts. In September 2013, it was announced that Hardee's would expand into the Northeastern United States. In April 2015, Hardee's announced the opening of its 300th restaurant in the Middle East with longtime franchisee, The Americana Group. In 2015, Nation's Restaurant News ranked Hardee's as the No. 28 foodservice chain by sales in the United States through 2011. Carl's Jr. was ranked at No. 37. Combined sales would rank the two at No. 15. In 2013, QSR listed Hardee's at No. 20 and Carl's Jr. at No. 24; if combined they would have been listed at No. 14. In July 2015, Hardee's announced that it would be offering The All- Natural Burger, which launched at sister-chain Carl's Jr. restaurants in December 2014. As of March 2016, CKE has a total of 3,664 franchised or company-operated restaurants in 44 states and 37 foreign countries and U.S. territories. Controversies, disputes, and legal issues =Burger Chef trademark dispute= In January 2007, Hardee's had a challenge filed against it with the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office by River West Brands, LLC of Chicago for the use of the Burger Chef trademark and name. Shortly thereafter, Hardee's reissued the Burger Chef Big Shef sandwich in Terre Haute, Indiana, as a trial offering and later in additional Indiana markets and Dayton, Ohio for a limited time. The reissue of the Big Shef has also used the Burger Chef name and logo in advertisements in the markets in which it is offered, and has claimed to provide Burger Chef fans with their Big Shef \\"fix\\". On April 16, 2009, River West Brands dropped their petition for cancellation and both parties agreed to pay their own attorney's fees. =Harvey's controversy= Due to a trademark dispute with Canada's Harvey's burger chain, the Hardee's brand name cannot be used in the country. Instead, CKE Restaurants operates exclusively under the Carl's Jr. banner. Advertising A Hardee's in Hong Kong A new Hardee's logo was unveiled in 2006 that featured script lettering and retained the iconic Happy Star, further unifying the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. brands. Hardee's also marketed special Super Bowl celebratory pins in the early 1990s. =Controversy= Several Hardee's ad campaigns in the 2000s have been criticized by groups including Parents Television Council for their sexually suggestive nature. A campaign titled \\"More Than a Piece of Meat\\" featured scantily clad women appearing to receive sexual gratification from consuming Hardee's products, and \\"Name Our Holes\\" ‚Äî an ad campaign and website promoting Hardee's Biscuit Holes. In January 2015, Carl's Jr. released a commercial online featuring model Charlotte McKinney advertising its new All Natural Burger to air regionally during Super Bowl XLIX. The ad features McKinney walking around a farmers' market, implying that she is \\"all natural\\" and uses double entendres to suggest that she is naked with strategically placed items in the market until it reveals McKinney in a bikini eating the All Natural Burger. Critics suggest that the ad \\"sets feminism back four decades,\\" while others, including McKinney's elderly grandfather, enjoyed the ad. The ad now features Hardee's cobranding, as the All Natural Burger is now offered by Hardee's. As of March 2016, the ad has received over 4.5 billion media impressions worldwide and more than 12 million views on the chains‚Äô YouTube channel. = Carl Hardee Sr. Campaign= In March 2017, Hardee's began to move away from the sexualized ads by releasing a commercial featuring a white bearded character played by Charles Esten as \\"Carl Hardee Sr.\\" who had come back into the office (much to the delight of the employees) to find his son (Drew Tarver), a.k.a. \\"Carl Jr.\\" who was focusing on sex appeal over its food. The commercial marked a turning point in CKE's advertising, as the company wanted to move away from its provocative ads and focus more on food and as a competitor to Five Guys, Steak 'n Shake, and In-N-Out Burger. \\"Carl Hardee Sr.\\" was also expected to become the new company spokesperson. =Tastes Like America= In 2018, CKE resumed producing separate campaigns for their Hardee's and Carl's Jr. brands. For Hardee's, it started the Tastes Like America campaign with music by Big Wet. For this campaign, Hardee's restored its 1976 logo, now in white; however, the Happy Star still appears, replacing the A in \\"Tastes\\". The previous logo will also continue to be used as well. International franchises Many international Hardee's franchises are located in countries in the Middle East and Pakistan, most being owned and operated by Americana Group. The Americana Group opened the Middle East's first Hardee's restaurant in Kuwait in June 1980. As of 2016, there are over 300 Hardee's restaurants throughout Asia and the Middle East, specifically in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Singapore had a Hardee's franchise first opened in 1984, but the last three outlets closed in 1988. Hardee's opened a store in South Korea in 1990, but it pulled in 2004, due to poor performance. Hardees also used to operate in Hong Kong, but it pulled out in 2006, due to licensing issues with its US parent.https://www.scmp.com/article/576755/popular-burger-chain-closes-doors- last-time Specifically, in the Middle East, the Hardee's menu does not include any pork items and each beef is certified Halal due to religious and cultural beliefs. The same menu is offered at Hardee's locations in Pakistan, which opened its first location in the country in 2009 in Lahore. Hardee's currently has eighteen locations in Pakistan, with six in Lahore, four in Karachi, two each in Islamabad & Rawalpindi and one each in Faisalabad, Bhera, Peshawar and Multan. In 2014, it opened a restaurant in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan.

Oral tradition is cultural material and traditions transmitted by word of mouth through successive generations. Storytelling and oral tradition are forms of word of mouth that play important roles in folklore and mythology.

Oral storytelling remains the dominant medium of learning in some countries with low literacy rates. Oral tradition Oral tradition (sometimes referred to as \\"oral culture\\" or \\"oral lore\\") is cultural material and traditions transmitted orally from one generation to another.Vansina, Jan: \\"Oral Tradition as History\\", 1985, James Currey Publishers, , ; at page 27 and 28, where Vansina defines oral tradition as \\"verbal messages which are reported statements from the past beyond the present generation\\" which \\"specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken sung or called out on musical instruments only\\"; \\"There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation\\". He points out that \\"Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge.

Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted.\\" The messages or testimony are verbally transmitted in speech or song and may take the form, for example, of folktales, sayings, ballads, songs, or chants. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledges across generations without a writing system. Sociologists emphasize a requirement that the material is held in common by a group of people, over several generations, and thus distinguish oral tradition from testimony or oral history.Henige, David.

While in Kenya, Obote became involved in the national independence movement. Upon returning to Uganda in 1956, he joined the political party Uganda National Congress (UNC), and was elected to the colonial Legislative Council in 1957.\\"The Roots, Emergence, and Growth of the Uganda Peoples Congress, 1600‚Äì1985\\", Yoga Adhola, UPC Website. In 1959, the UNC split into two factions, with one faction under the leadership of Obote merging with Uganda People's Union to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC). Prime Minister In the runup to independence elections, Obote formed a coalition with the Buganda royalist party, Kabaka Yekka. The two parties controlled a Parliamentary majority and Obote became Prime Minister in 1962. He assumed the post on 25 April 1962, appointed by Sir Walter Coutts, then Governor-General of Uganda. The following year the position of Governor- General was replaced by a ceremonial presidency to be elected by the parliament. Mutesa, the Kabaka (King) of Buganda, became the ceremonial President, with Obote as executive prime minister. From left to right: Grace Ibingira, Obote, and John Kakonge in 1962 In January 1964, a mutiny occurred at the military barracks at Jinja, Uganda's second city and home to the 1st Battalion of the Uganda Army. There were similar mutinies in two other eastern African states; all three countries requested the support of troops from the British military. Before they arrived, however, Obote sent his defence minister Felix Onama to negotiate with the mutineers. Onama was held hostage, and agreed to many demands, including significant pay increases for the army, and the rapid promotion of many officers, including the future president Idi Amin. In 1965, Kenyans had been barred from leadership positions within the government, and this was followed by the removal of Kenyans en masse from Uganda in 1969, under Obote's guidance. As prime minister, Obote was implicated in a gold smuggling plot, together with Idi Amin, then deputy commander of the Ugandan armed forces. When the Parliament demanded an investigation of Obote and the ousting of Amin, he suspended the constitution and declared himself President in March 1966, allocating to himself almost unlimited power under state of emergency rulings. Several members of his cabinet, who were leaders of rival factions in the party, were arrested and detained without charge. Obote responded with an armed attack upon Mutesa's palace, which ended with Mutesa fleeing to exile. In 1967, Obote's power was cemented when the parliament passed a new constitution that abolished the federal structure of the independence constitution and created an executive presidency. Presidency =First term= In 1969, there was an attempt on Obote's life. In the aftermath of the attempt, all opposition political parties were banned, leaving Obote as an effectively absolute ruler. A state of emergency was in force for much of the time and many political opponents were jailed without trial for life. Obote's regime terrorised, harassed, and tortured people. His secret police, the General Service Unit, led by Obote's cousin, was responsible for many cruelties. In 1969‚Äì70, Obote published a series of pamphlets that were supposed to outline his political and economic policy. The Common Man's Charter was a summary of his approach to socialism, which became known as the Move to the Left. The government took over a 60% share in major private corporations and banks in the country in 1970. During Obote's regime, flagrant and widespread corruption emerged in the name of his version of \\"socialism\\". Food shortages sent prices through the ceiling. Obote's persecution of Indian traders contributed to this rise in prices. In January 1971, Obote was overthrown by the army while on a visit to Singapore to attend a Commonwealth conference, and Amin became President. In the two years before the coup Obote's relations with the West had become strained. Some have suggested that Western Governments were at least aware of, and may have aided, the coup.George Ivan Smith, Ghosts of Kampala: The Rise and Fall of Idi Amin (1980).G. S. K. Ibingira (1980), African Upheavals since Independence, Westview Press, Obote fled to Tanzania. The fall of Obote's regime was welcomed and celebrated by many Ugandans. =Second term= In 1979, Idi Amin was ousted by Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles. By 1980, Uganda was governed by an interim Presidential Commission. At the time of the 1980 elections, the chairman of the commission was a close associate of Obote, Paulo Muwanga. Muwanga had briefly been the de facto President of Uganda from 12‚Äì20 May 1980, as one of three presidents who served for short periods of time between Amin's ousting and the setting up of the Presidential Commission. The other two presidents were Yusuf Lule and Godfrey Binaisa. The elections in 1980 were won by Obote's Uganda People's Congress (UPC) party. However, the UPC's opposition believed that the elections were rigged and this led to a guerrilla war by Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) and several other military groups. Obote hold the additional title of Minister of Finance.https://www.newvision.co.ug/news/1010258/uganda-eur-finance-ministers- independence In 1983, the Obote government launched Operation Bonanza, a military expedition that claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced a significant portion of the population. The brunt of the blame for this massacre was placed on the people of northern Uganda for supporting the action of the Prime Minister which increased the existing regional tensions in the country. It has been estimated that approximately 100,000 to 500,000 people died as a result of fighting between Obote's Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) and the guerrillas.Henry Wasswa (10 October 2005), \\"Uganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80\\", Associated PressBercovitch, Jacob and Jackson, Richard (1997), International Conflict: A Chronological Encyclopedia of Conflicts and Their Management 1945‚Äì1995. Congressional Quarterly. .Uganda. CIA Factbook. On 27 July 1985, Obote was deposed again. As in 1971, he was overthrown by his own army commanders in a military coup d'√©tat; this time the commanders were Brigadier Bazilio Olara- Okello and General Tito Okello. The two men briefly ruled the country through a Military Council, but after a few months of near chaos, Museveni's NRA seized control of the country. By July 1985, Amnesty International estimated that the Obote regime had been responsible for more than 300,000 civilian deaths across Uganda. Abuses were particularly conspicuous in an area of central Uganda known as the Luweero Triangle.\\"Notes On Concealment Of Genocide In Uganda\\", Black Star News, 11 December 2008. Death in exile After his second removal from power, Obote fled to Kenya and later to Zambia. For some years, it was rumoured that he would return to Ugandan politics. In August 2005, however, he announced his intention to step down as leader of the UPC.\\"Uganda's exiled ex-president Obote to retire from party's presidency\\", Xinhua, 28 August 2005.

This high valley ranges in elevation from approximately 9,000 to 10,000 ft (3,000 m). It encompasses approximately 1,000 square miles (2,590 km¬≤ or 640,000 acres) around the headwaters of the South Platte River in Park County approximately 60 mi (100 km) southwest of Denver. It is the largest and southernmost of three similarly named high altitude basins in the Front Range of Colorado, the others being North Park and Middle Park. The largest town in the basin is Fairplay, with a population of 681. Geology Geologically, the valley is a wide faulted syncline of sedimentary rocks, sitting between the predominantly Precambrian igneous rocks of the Front Range to the east and the Sawatch Uplift to the west. The Mosquito Range forms a high barrier along the western side of the valley. The long-extinct Thirty-Nine Mile volcanic field is located just to the southeast. The valley is mostly underlain by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks concealed by a thin layer of gravel laid down by glaciation during Pleistocene time. The underlying rocks are dipping slightly to the east. The eastern (and newer) side of the valley is underlain primarily by Pierre Shale laid down during Cretaceous time. The western (and older) side of the valley, on the west side of Red Hill, is underlain primarily by Permian and Pennsylvanian rocks. Red Hill runs through the center of the valley as a hogback ridge of tilted Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary rocks. =Gold= Gold mining in South Park began in 1859. Extensive placer deposits were mined along the west side of the park, and lode deposits were mined in the Mosquito Range. The extensive gravel ridges east of Fairplay are the result of dredging for gold. (see Gold mining in Colorado). =Petroleum= Although South Park contains some of the same geologic formations that yield oil and gas in the Denver Basin further east, efforts to find commercial oil and gas in South Park have so far proven unsuccessful. =Uranium= A minor amount of uranium has been mined from sandstone in South Park (see Uranium mining in Colorado). Transportation U.S. Highway 285 in South Park The valley is traversed by several highways, including U.S. Highway 285, which enters the valley from the eastern side over the Front Range at Kenosha Pass, providing a vehicle link to Denver. The highway crosses Red Hill at Red Hill Pass. On its northern side, the valley is connected by several high mountain passes to the valley of the North Fork of the South Platte River (a tributary of the South Platte). It is also connected by CO Route 9 via Hoosier Pass to the valley to the Blue River near Breckenridge. To the west, the extremely high Mosquito Pass crosses the Mosquito Range to Leadville. (Mosquito Pass is no longer a practical transportation route, but is now a historical and recreation site.) On its southwestern side, at the southern end of the Mosquito Range, it is connected by Trout Creek Pass to the upper valley of the Arkansas River near Buena Vista. U.S. Highway 24 enters South Park from the east at Wilkerson Pass, where the highway provides vehicle access to Colorado Springs. To the very south, CO Route 9 crosses Currant Creek Pass, which marks the southern edge of the South Park region. History Like much of the mountainous areas of Colorado, the valley was inhabited by Utes before the arrival of white settlers in the middle 19th century. However, from the 1850s onward, the area was increasingly encroached on by Southern Arapaho bands, who came to cherish it as an important buffalo range after witnessing the continued degradation of their typical hunting grounds on the plains in the wake of white westward movement, and who repeatedly became entangled in skirmishes with the Utes over the territory. It was explored by John C. Fremont during his second expedition in 1844, at which time it was referred to as \\"Bayou Salade,\\" a corruption of Spanish \\"Valle Salado,\\" meaning salty valley.http://cozine.com/2006-september/the-source-of- bayou-salado/ In 1859 the discovery of placer gold in the streams of the valley during the Colorado Gold Rush led to an influx of prospectors and miners. The town of Fairplay was founded as a more law-abiding place to live than the older, nearby town of Tarryall during this time and continued to be a center of gold, and later silver mining up through the middle 20th century. South Park City, an open-air museum outside Fairplay, provides a historical recreation of the gold rush days. The basin was connected to Denver by railroad with the extension of the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad over Kenosha Pass in 1879.
