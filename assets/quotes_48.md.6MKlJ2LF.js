Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres Portrait of Madame Duvaucey is an 1807 oil on canvas painting by Jean-Auguste- Dominique Ingres. It shows Antonia Duvau√ßey of Nittis, the lover of Charles- Jean-Marie Alquier, then ambassador to the Holy See. Duvaucey is positioned in a flat pictorial space, gazing frontally at the viewer, dressed in lavish clothing and accessories. The portrait is the first female portrait painted during the artist's stay in Rome.Rosenblum, 62 Portrait of Madame Duvaucey is acclaimed for exhibiting her enigmatic charm, and as \\"not a portrait that gives pleasure..[but]...a portrait that gives rise to dreams\\".Stevens, Mark. \\"High and Low\\". New York Magazine, Retrieved 14 September 217 Ingres, Study for a Portrait of Madame Duvaucey. Graphite and black chalk. Duvaucey stares out directly at the viewer with a sly and suggestive smile. Set against a flat grey background, the perspective of the portrait is very shallow overall. It is framed by the inwards swoops of the cured rose and gold Louis XVI chair, and embroidered pale yellow and red silk shawl. She holds an expensive looking fan, and is adorned with three partly visible rings, an elegant thin necklace and elephant hair bracelets. Typical of Ingres' female portraits, her anatomy seems almost boneless. Her arms are out of proportion, with her left arm, at the viewer's right, far longer than her left. Her neck is too elongated and doesn't seem strong enough to support her head. In a prelude to his later \\"Odalisque\\" paintings, her facial features seem almost arabesque. The contemporary critic Th√©ophile Gautier wrote of her that \\"there is no woman that M. Ingres has painted, but the likeness of the ancient Chimera, in Empire dress.Betzer, 9 Grande Odalisque, 1814 Ingres was paid 500 francs for the commission. It was exhibited at the 1833 Salon and again in 1855,Betzer, 7 and while one critic complained of its \\"dry, shadow-less quality, and..the defective anatomy\\", the painting was a huge success - his most acclaimed at the 1833 Salon- and drew critical and popular admiration. Ingres was widely praised, especially for his skill with line and his \\"religion of form\\". It is today seen as groundbreaking in the development of portraiture.Tinterow,et al, 514 Forty years after its completion, Duvaucey was in urgent need of money, and visited Ingres in Paris to sell the painting. Ingres recognised her, and found a buyer in Fredric Reisit, whose collection became the Mus√©e Cond√©, Chantilly where the painting remains today. References Notes Sources *Betzer, Sarah.

Occupying the former Lonsdale Street site of Myer's Melbourne store, Emporium opened in 2014 following extensive redevelopment. The centre includes a food court, specialty stores and several multi-level anchor retailers, as well as a top floor extension of Myer's Bourke Street store. Emporium forms part of a precinct of linked shopping centres in the Melbourne CBD, which also includes the Myer and David Jones city stores, Melbourne Central, GPO and Elizabeth Street's The Strand.  History  From 1911 to 1934, Melbourne businessman Sidney Myer acquired and constructed 10 buildings between Lonsdale and Bourke streets in the central city while establishing his Myer chain of department stores. The first new building was completed facing Bourke Street in 1914, and the 8-storey structure was named the \\"Myer Emporium\\". In 1925, work began on a new, 11-storey building facing Lonsdale Street, designed by H.W. and F.B. Tompkins and influenced by Classical and Beaux-Arts architectural styles. This structure incorporated parts of previous buildings, which resulted in a complex layout and multiple mezzanine levels. In 1962, a pedestrian bridge was constructed between first, second and third storeys of the Bourke Street and Lonsdale Street buildings. In March 2007, Myer announced plans to close the Lonsdale Street store as part of a redevelopment in which it would sell both buildings and lease back the Bourke Street store. It was expected by Myer's real estate agents that the Lonsdale Street building would be converted into \\"a mixed-use development with retail, hotel and serviced-apartment components\\". By March 2009, the sale had not been finalised, with potential buyer and owner of Melbourne Central GPT Group concerned that the redevelopment of the Lonsdale Street site would interfere with pedestrian flows in the area . In August of that year, the Victorian Government approved a redevelopment of the Lonsdale Street site as a shopping centre name \\"Emporium Melbourne\\". It was speculated that an Apple Store would be the flagship retailer in the new centre, and that the project would be completed by December 2012. Construction commenced in August 2011, by which time developers Colonial First State Global Asset Management hoped for completion by Christmas 2013. Beginning on 22 August 2012, construction was delayed by strike action by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, who demanded the right for their members to elect shop stewards and display union regalia. The dispute continued when the union refused to comply with a Supreme Court of Victoria order to end the strike and workers from builder Grocon were escorted onto the site by Victoria Police. Despite the union's subsequent threats of a statewide building industry strike, the blockade ended on 7 September when Grocon agreed to further negotiations. The union was eventually forced to pay a $1.25 million fine and $3.5 million in a damages settlement over the incident. Emporium Melbourne was opened by then Premier of Victoria Denis Napthine in April 2014. The final cost of the project was estimated at $1.2 billion. A \\"gala opening\\" event in August was directed by Australian film director Baz Luhrmann.  Current centre  Emporium has 224 tenancies across 7 of the building's floors, with an eighth floor containing only management offices. Major tenants include Din Tai Fung, Muji, Superdry, Uniqlo and Coach. Other key tenants include Furla, Lancel, Brooks Brothers, Polo Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Mulberry, Aesop, Nespresso, Oroton, Victoria's Secret, Marimekko and Chanel Beauty. Level 4 is entirely occupied by a department of the Bourke Street Myer store, which, like levels Lower Ground, 1, 2 and 3, is connected by pedestrian bridge to the main Myer building. This extension, opened in May 2014, was marketed as the \\"Myer Emporium\\" and described by the company as \\"the final stage of the transformation of Myer Melbourne\\". A second footbridge from levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 also connects directly to the David Jones store which occupies the property next to Myer between Bourke and Little Bourke streets. A food court with approximately 30 food outlets is located on Level 3 and includes mostly independent food outlets. The food court has been described by managers as an attempt to appeal to \\"discerning\\" customers and consequently takes inspiration from luxury food courts in Asia.

Open source product development instantiate the concept of open-source model in the context of physical products.  Characteristics  OSPD is characterized by the simultaneity of two forms of openness: product openness (the development of open source hardware products as defined by the Open Source Definition) and process openness (the possibility for any interested person to take part in the collaborative development process). Generally, OSPD processes are relevant for complex products, whose definition requires the collaborative integration of inputs from multiple contributions. This, however, does not excludes the existence of OSPD processes for simple products. In that sense, OSPD specifies the concept of \\"open source innovation\\" as defined by HuizinghHuizingh, Eelko K. R. E. 2011. ‚ÄúOpen Innovation: State of the Art and Future Perspectives.‚Äù Technovation, Open Innovation - ISPIM Selected Papers, 31 (1): 2‚Äì9. in the case of complex tangible products. Process openness requires that the product development process is performed by a \\"community\\". The word \\"community\\" is used in contrast to \\"company\\" or \\"team\\" in order to highlight three fundamental differences with the governance of conventional industrial product development.see for example Demazi√®re, Didier, Fran√ßois Horn, and Marc Zune. ‚ÄúDes relations de travail sans r√®gles ?‚Äù Soci√©t√©s contemporaines, no. 66: 101‚Äì125. First, communities are groups of individual people whose affiliation to institutions or companies has little influence on the role they play in the product development project. Second, the participation of a member to a community is voluntary, that is, each member defines independently his/her degree of involvement and the delivered workload is generally not paid. Third, the composition of a community is not set at the beginning of the project but is open for the participation of any interested person and evolves along the self-defined involvement of the community members. OSPD is \\"collaborative\\" in that it is performed with a certain simultaneity or parallelity in the work provided by the community members. In other words, OSPD is characterized by \\"intention for co-development\\".Raasch, Christina, and Cornelius Herstatt. 2011. \\"Product Development in Open Design Communities: A Process Perspective.\\" International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management 08 (04): 557‚Äì575. Collaboration is defined as the coordinated work performed by a group using common material and following a common objective.Leimeister, Jan Marco, and Eva Alice Christiane Bittner. 2014. ‚ÄúCollaboration Engineering.‚Äù WiSt - Wirtschaftswissenschaftliches Studium 43 (5): 243‚Äì249. It therefore delineates with sequential development loops of open source designsfor a description of such iterative processes, see Kyriakou, Harris, Jeffrey V.

Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network. where a product is sequentially developed and released by an isolated member then reused, further developed and released again by another community member, and so on. Further characteristics * OSPD is mostly an internet phenomenon: continuity of work, acquisition of new members and collaboration in (eventually geographically distributed) communities is enabled by online data management and communication. The online platform has been described as the \\"core\\" of an OSPD project,Fjeldsted, A.S., G. Adalsteinsdottir, T. J. Howard, and T. C. McAloone. 2012. \\"Open Source Development of Tangible Products-from a Business Perspective.\\" In DS 71: Proceedings of NordDesign 2012, the 9th NordDesign conference, Aarlborg University, Denmark. 22-24.08.2012. whereas own research to be published shows that OSPD projects are not focused on one platform but tend to use several parallel tools and communication channels.Bonvoisin, J√©r√©my, Laetitia Thomas, Robert Mies, C√©line Gros, Rainer Stark, Karine Samuel, Roland Jochem, Jean- Fran√ßois Boujut. \\"Current state of practices in open source product development.\\" Accepted for publication at the ICED 2017 Conference (to be published) * In contrast to conventional industrial product development, the OSPD process is not characterized by clearly defined inputs, outputs and timelines, but is more an ongoing continuous improvement process. * OSPD projects are not embedded in formal organisations but are characterized by a low level of restrictions, self-motivation and self-selection of modular tasks that can be performed by one person. * OSPD processes not only aim at generating a functioning and convivial technology but equally at personal development and process learning. * The concept of OSPD implies the coexistence of three interwoven objects: a community involved in a project aiming at developing a product. While those three concepts are necessary for the emergence of OSPD, they do not necessarily have a 1:1 relation. There may be for example communities involved in different projects or projects aiming at developing different products.  Delineation with other terms  * Not all open source hardware projects are OSPD projects. OSPD projects are those of the open source hardware projects where a community-based collaborative product development process takes place. * OSPD delineates clearly with crowdsourcing. In crowdsourcing, the outcome of the collaborative product development process is protected and the process is per definition centralized around a company or an institution. In OSPD, the outcome of the process is open source and the community is not necessarily centred around a company. * The term open design may be used as an alternative to OSPD in literature. However, it is generally defined in less specific terms and is coined by conflicting definitions. Most of the available definitions do not refer simultaneously to product openness (the development of open source hardware products as defined by the Open Source Definition) and process openness (possibility to any interested person to take part in the collaborative development process). ** Brul√© and ValentinBrul√©, Emeline, and Fr√©d√©ric Valentin. 2016. \\"Of Open Bodies: Challenges and Perspectives of an Open Design Paradigm.\\" In 50th Anniversary Design Research Society Conference. Proceedings of DRS‚Äô16. Brighton, United Kingdom. define openness in the context of open design as \\"the inclusion of people and their values during the project framing and ideation process\\" and as \\"a space left to users in the formalization process (choice of functions, interactions, aesthetcics...)\\". Open design is in this sense the inclusion of the end user in the development of the artefact through the sharing of designs that are low constrained and can be customized. Although this definition refers in some way to both process and product openness, it is expressed in more generic terms than the provided OSPD definition. ** In the Open Design Manifesto,Ronen Kadushin, \\"Open Design Manifesto.\\" Kadushin defines open design as \\"a method consist[ing] of two preconditions: 1. An Open Design is CAD information published online under a Creative Commons license to be downloaded, produced, copied and modified. 2. An Open Design product is produced directly from file by CNC machines and without special tooling.\\" This definition does not refer to collaborative product development. This definition only refers to product openness. ** In the \\"Open Design Definition v. 0.5\\",Open Design Definition v. 0.5 Meninchinelli and colleagues define open design as \\"a design artifact project whose source documentation is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, prototype and sell the artifact based on that design. In this sense, the term open design is used as a synonym of open source hardware. It only refers to product openness. ** The definition of Aitamurto et al.Aitamurto, Tanja, D√≥nal Holland, and Sofia Hussain. 2015. \\"The Open Paradigm in Design Research. Design Issues 31 (4): 17‚Äì29. is the definition which is at the closest to the definition of OSPD provided here: open design is a \\"process provid[ing] public access to participation in the design process and to the product resulting from that process, as well as the data created in the design process, including technical details and other data and content gathered or generated during the process.\\" In that sense, OSPD is a specification of open design where the terms of product openness are specified by the open source definition. ** Ostuzzi et al.Ostuzzi, Francesca, Peter Conradie, Lieven De Couvreur, Jan Detand, and Jelle Saldien. 2016. ‚ÄúThe Role of Re-Appropriation in Open Design: A Case Study on How Openness in Higher Education for Industrial Design Engineering Can Trigger Global Discussions on the Theme of Urban Gardening.‚Äù The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning 17 (4). define open design as a product property, i.e. the spaces of freedom offered by a product so it can be reappropriated and adapted to another context than the original one. ** Buitenhuis and PearceBuitenhuis, A.

His childhood dream came through when he passed the exam. He married Hatice Halisdemir, with whom he had a daughter, Elifnur, and a son, Doƒüan Ertuƒürul. Military career In 1999, √ñmer Halisdemir joined the Turkish Armed Forces as a non-commissioned officer of the infantry. He served in southeastern Turkey in ≈ûƒ±rnak, Silopi and also outside the country in Northern Iraq and Afghanistan. He became a senior sergeant major (). He was a very successful serviceman fulfilling critical tasks, and was awarded various military decorations. Finally, he was deployed to a strategic position at the Turkish Army's elite Special Forces Command, stationed at the headquarters in Ankara, as the staff sergeant of the commander Major general Zekai Aksakallƒ± (born 1962). He served a long time as an aide for Gen. Aksakallƒ±.  2016 coup d'√©tat attempt, killing of Terzi, and death  On the night of July 15, the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt, Maj. Gen. Aksakallƒ± heard about the coup attempt as he was not present in the headquarters. His official car was intercepted by three military vehicles on the way to the Presidential Complex. He nevertheless managed to get away from the ambush of the pro-coup troops, which were seeking to capture him. He learned that Brigadier general Semih Terzi, commander of the 1st Special Forces Brigade in Silopi, southeastern Anatolia, was assigned by the coup plotters to take over the Special Forces Command. He quickly ordered his right-hand man, the staff sergeant Halisdemir by phone to take out Terzi in order to prevent this action. Halisdemir simply affirmed the order, which was a fatal task. He took a hiding position in the foliage at the front yard of the headquarters building. Brig. Gen. Terzi and ten heavily armed troops and officers escorting him, who flew in from a military base in Diyarbakƒ±r, landed with a helicopter outside the headquarters around 02:16 local time on July 16. Halisdemir came out from his hiding place and joined the crowd marching towards the entrance of the headquarters building. He drew his handgun and shot the general three times in the head, killing him. Halisdemir then tried to run away. Major Fatih ≈ûahin immediately responded with a barrage of fifteen rounds of gunfire, hitting Halisdemir twelve times in the back. Halisdemir's body was carried out of the way. As Lieutenant Mihrali Atmaca noticed that Halisdemir was still alive, he shot him once more, this time fatally. Brig. Gen. Terzi was rushed to the military hospital by helicopter. The capture plan turned into a disarray since the chain of command was broken. The whole event was captured on security cameras. Halisdemir's father later said that \\"his son served five years for Gen. Terzi, and Terzi thought he could easily take over the headquarters from Halisdemir.\\" Aftermath The coup attempt failed nationwide as the rebels were met with a fierce resistance from the public, police and loyalist military. The whole coup attempt was suppressed within the early hours of July 16. The pro-coup military personnel, who tried to capture the Special Forces Command and killed Sgt. Halisdemir, were arrested. Trial of the seventeen officers began on February 20, 2017. They are each facing a life sentence if found guilty. √ñmer Halisdemir was buried in his hometown, √áukurkuyu, on July 17, 2016. His funeral was attended by high-ranking local officials and thousands of others. Legacy A monument to commemorate Halisdemir and his bravery was erected in the front yard of the Special Forces Command headquarters, where he was killed, next to a spot which contains his preserved blood stain. A public outpouring of sympathy has met Halisdemir, whose grave is visited by a great number of people who come to pay their respects. A number of schools, parks and public places were named in honor of him. Niƒüde University, a high school in Etimesgut, Ankara, a middle school in Yunusemre, Manisa, a primary school in Kahramanmara≈ü, a conference hall in Malatya, ƒ∞mam Hatip high schools in ƒ∞zmir, Yenimahalle, Ankara and √áekmek√∂y, Istanbul bear his name.

Life  Uvo H√∂lscher was born, the younger of his parents' two recorded sons, in Halle. His father, Gustav H√∂lscher was a theologian. His mother, born Borghild Gjessing, was the daughter of a school director from Oslo. His grandfather, Wilhelm H√∂lscher, was also a theologian. Uvo H√∂lscher attended secondary schools in Marburg and Bonn. He moved on to T√ºbingen and Munich universities where he studied natural sciences and cultural sciences, then progressing to Frankfurt where he studied classical philology, enthused in particular by the lecturer Karl Reinhardt. It was at Reinhardt's regular Saturday morning gatherings that he met Max Kommerell and his student contemporary Dorothea Lohmeyer, whom in 1940 he married. In 1937 he received his doctorate for a dissertation on \\"The Philosophy of Empedocles\\", supervised for the work by Reinhardt. The next day he was conscripted for his military service. He nevertheless managed to receive his habilitation in 1944, during a brief vacation with Bruno Snell in Hamburg. However, his dissertation, which concerned the use of the Ekkyklema machine in Greek drama, was not published and he was obliged to provide the party with a statement that he would never apply to become a professor. After the war ended he was imprisoned under conditions that became particularly harsh after he tried to escape. He was released in 1946 and his habilitation was re-awarded, this time at Munich where for a time he was the sole representative of his discipline at the university, till he was joined by Friedrich Klingner and Rudolf Pfeiffer. After a period in England, in 1954 H√∂lscher was appointed a professor at the recently launched Free University of Berlin. He transferred to Heidelberg in 1962 and then, in 1970, returned as a professor to Munich. H√∂lscher's work followed the trajectory set by his mentor, Karl Reinhardt. His work covered early Greek epic poetry, especially that of Homer, and Pre-Socratic philosophy. His best known book is a justification for classical philology, \\"Die Chance des Unbehagens - Zur Situation der klassischen Studien\\" (1965). His formulation of the \\"adjacent stranger\\" is often cited when describing the relationship between the modern age and antiquity. His most important work is \\"Die Odyssee - Epos zwischen M√§rchen und Roman\\" (1988).  Memberships and honours  * Between 1969 and 1971 H√∂lscher was a full member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He remained a corresponding member after his move to Munich. * Between 1978 and 1990 he served as president of the H√∂lderlin Society. * In 1989 he was the winner of Pforzheim's Reuchlin Prize.

Dedicated to Saint Michael, it is one of the prominent works of 20th-century Slovenian architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik, and is listed in the Register of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Slovenia. History The church was commissioned on behalf of Trnovo parish, with support of the parish priest and writer Fran Sale≈°ki Fin≈ægar. In 1922, Fin≈ægar asked his neighbour Pleƒçnik to prepare some plans for the church. The task proved challenging due to the soft ground of the Ljubljana Marshes. Initial plans were scrapped due to extensive floods and economic recession in the 1920s, however, Pleƒçnik prepared new plans in 1935. Fin≈ægar retired in 1936 and the organizational tasks were taken over by Karel Matkoviƒç, Pleƒçnik's nephew. Following some initial disagreements with local landowners, the construction begun in 1937. The construction site specifics called for some innovative solutions by Pleƒçnik. The soft grounds required the church to be built on supports rammed into the mud. In addition, the bell-tower was constructed separately from the main building and its weight was reduced by arched openings. The church aisle itself is elevated, with a staircase leading to it. The basement is occupied by classrooms and priest's living quarters. Due to budget constraints, Pleƒçnik used local materials, such as the stone from the nearby Podpeƒç quarry and timber, donated by the locals. Pleƒçnik only used stone for the central part and for the four corners, while he used concrete sewer pipes and timber to fill in the empty spaces. He also used concrete roof tiles. The church was completed in 1939 and consecrated in 1940 by Ljubljana's bishop Gregorij Ro≈æman. The sanctuary has an unusual orientation:the altar is placed on the longer side of the nave, thereby reducing the distance between the priest and the church-goers. This is the approach that Pleƒçnik also took at the Church of St. Francis in Ljubljana. With the main altar placed almost in the centre, Pleƒçnik preceded the principles set by the Second Vatican Council by several decades, bringing a new design to the sanctuary. Today, the church is considered as one of Pleƒçnik's masterpieces and is, together with his other works, listed on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, as The timeless, humanistic architecture of Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik in Ljubljana and Prague.

Marjanoviƒá started his career in the mid-1950s, raising to fame in the late 1950s with his theatrical on-stage performance. During the 1960s he recorded a large number of hit songs and became the first superstar of the Yugoslav popular music, but also achieved large popularity in Soviet Union. Due to his on-stage performance and inclusion of foreign rock and roll hits into his repertoire, Marjanoviƒá is often described as one of the pioneers of the Yugoslav rock scene.\\"Rockovnik, Strana II, \\"Ljubav i moda\\" Beograd 1958‚Äì63\\", Rockovnik official YouTube channel During the 1970s and 1980s he managed to maintain a loyal fanbase. In 1990, he suffered a stroke on stage, from which he partially recovered, but decided to retire from the scene, to this day appearing live occasionally only. Early biography ƒêorƒëe Marjanoviƒá's father, Sveta Marjanoviƒá, was born in the village of Duboko, near the town Kuƒçevo in Eastern Serbia. He attended high school in Po≈æarevac, and when he was fifteen, he was among the civilians who followed the Serbian Army on its retreat through Albania. He was among the young men which the Serbian government in exile in Greece sent to the United Kingdom to receive education. He graduated from George Heriot's School and started his studies on the Manchester Metropolitan University, but returned home without graduating. He graduated from the Export Academy in Zagreb and returned to Kuƒçevo, where he started working as a bank clerk. ƒêorƒëe Marjanoviƒá was born on 30 October 1931 in Kuƒçevo. His mother died when he was only nine months old. After the death of his wife, Marjanoviƒá's father left the child with his wife's mother, who would raise him. Marjanoviƒá had a sister, Ljiljana, and a half-brother from his father's second marriage, Vojislav. Marjanoviƒá attended high school in Po≈æarevac. During high school years, he showed interest in theatre, directing and acting in his own plays. After graduating from high school, he moved to Belgrade, where he, in 1950, after grandmother's wish, started his studies of pharmacy. However, his grandmother died, and Marjanoviƒá was left without any funds to continue his studies. To earn money he did various jobs: he unloaded freight cars on railroad stations, worked as a subscription collector for Radio Belgrade, worked as a milkman, and appeared as a background actor in Yugoslav Drama Theatre and in several Yugoslav films: Svi na more (Everybody to the Seaside), Anikina vremena (Anika's Time), Sumnjivo lice (Suspicious Person), Pesma sa Kumbare (The Song from Kumbara). Despite his efforts, he never finished his studies. Musical career Early career Marjanoviƒá started his musical career in 1954, when he appeared on an audition for amateur singers, organised by Association of Jazz Musicians of Serbia, singing the songs \\"Mulen ru≈æ\\" (\\"Moulin Rouge\\") and \\"Usamljeni gauƒço\\" (\\"The Lonely Gaucho\\"). Reputedly, wandering Belgrade streets, Marjanoviƒá met an acquaintance who was going to the audition and asked Marjanoviƒá to keep him company. When they arrived at the audition, it was almost at its end. Someone invited all the people waiting in, including Marjanoviƒá, who did not get a chance to say he did not come for the audition. He decided to try to sing. After the audition, he was approached by Radio Belgrade host Du≈°an Vidak, who told him that he passed. During the following years, he would appear on pop concerts featuring him and other singers, usually performing songs originally recorded by Yugoslav schlager singers Du≈°ko Jak≈°iƒá, Bruno Petrali and Ivo Robiƒá. At the end of 1957, he started performing the song \\"Zvi≈æduk u 8\\" (\\"Whistle at 8 O'clock\\"), written by Darko Kraljiƒá in the early 1950s, but not performed by any other singer before Marjanoviƒá. This song would later become one of his biggest hits and trademark songs. During these years, Marjanoviƒá became the first Yugoslav pop singer to include theatrical moves into his performance and to dance on stage, the first Yugoslav pop singer to take the microphone off the stand and walk with it down from the stage and into the audience, and the first to take off his jacket and throw it into the audience. Late 1950s and 1960s: Rise to fame, nationwide popularity and success in Soviet Union The crucial moment of Marjanoviƒá's career was his performance on a 1958 concert in Ni≈°. He appeared as an outsider, but thrilled the audience with his theatrical performance. This event brought him attention of the media and audience across Yugoslavia. He was gaining more fans across the country, but saw criticism by a part of the media, who criticized his lack of vocal skills and his \\"clownish behavior\\" with which he, as one of the papers wrote, \\"reminded of tasteless moves of some domestic singers in their pitiable imitation of the West\\". The editors of Radio Belgrade refused to invite Marjanoviƒá to perform in their live program. Despite all that, the primo uomo of Belgrade Opera Darko Pivniƒçki, who worked with young talents, decided to give singing lessons to Marjanoviƒá for free. The large popularity Marjanoviƒá enjoyed enabled him to record his first release, the album Muzika za igru (Music for Dancing). Marjanoviƒá recorded the album with the band Plavi Ansambl (The Blue Ensemble), which at the time consisted of Eduard Saƒëil (tenor saxophone), Petar Sam (accordion), Tripo Simonuti (violin), ƒêorƒëe Debaƒç (piano), Vladimir Vitas (vibraphone), Sveta Jakovljeviƒá (guitar), Milan Mihajloviƒá (double bass), Aleksandar Kosanoviƒá (drums) and Rade Jovanoviƒá (bongo drums). At the time of the album release, Marjanoviƒá was serving his mandatory army stint in Ljubljana. Released by PGP- RTB record label in 1959, Muzika za igru was the first popular music album released by the label and the first popular music solo album released in Serbia.\\"Istorijat PGP RTS\\", rts.rs The album was released on Marjanoviƒá's birthday, 30 October. The song \\"Zvi≈æduk u 8\\" was the album's biggest hit. The first printing of the record was sold in a month. After his return from the army, Marjanoviƒá appeared at the Opatija Music Festival with the songs \\"Prodavac novina\\" (\\"Newspaper Seller\\") and \\"Pesma raznosaƒça mleka\\" (\\"The Milkman Song\\"), winning three awards. In March 1961, his performance on a Zlatni mikrofon (Golden Microhone) festival in Belgrade's Trade Union Hall caused a media scandal and what is often described as the first post-WWII street protest in Belgrade. The festival featured leading pop singers of Yugoslavia; Marjanoviƒá decided to appeare on the festival performing the songs \\"Zvi≈æduk u 8\\" and \\"Milord\\" (a cover of √âdith Piaf's \\"Milord\\"). However, he was soon instructed to pick another song instead of \\"Milord\\"; it was explained to him that \\"Milord\\" is \\"too dramatic\\" and that it would \\"hinder the jury in making an objective decision\\". Marjanoviƒá decided to perform the song \\"Carolina, dai!\\", which was two months earlier performed at the eleventh Sanremo Music Festival. The festival jury should have awarded five Golden Microphone Awards to five best singers, however, they decided there are not enough singers worthy of the award. Their decision was to award only three Golden Microphones, to Lola Novakoviƒá, Nada Kne≈æeviƒá and Anica Zuboviƒá. After the announcer Du≈°an Vidak red the jury's decision and the names of the awarded singers, the audience got enraged with the fact that Marjanoviƒá is not among them. The audience started booing, chanting Marjanoviƒá's name and leaving the Hall, while the confused announcer proclaimed that the radio and television transmission had to be interrupted due to technical problems. This caused a large number of people to go out of their homes and go towards the Hall to see what is really happening. About 7,000 people gathered in front of the Hall. Some time after midnight, Marjanoviƒá tried to slip away through the back door of the Hall. After spotting him, the crowd carried him on their hands to an automobile parked in front of Hotel Moskva. There they placed him on the roof of the car, where he started singing. The audience sang with him for the next two hours, while the traffic stood still. After this event, screenwriters Ljubi≈°a Kozomara, Gordan Mihiƒá and Milan Miliƒáeviƒá Lango and film director Sava Mrmak recorded the comedy film Zvi≈æduk u 8, starring Marjanoviƒá. The film was panned by the film critics, but had huge success with the audience. Concurrently with the film release, Marjanoviƒá held eleven sold-out concerts in a row in the Trade Union Hall. On his concerts he sang, danced and spoke poetry. For one of the concerts he received a letter from the First Lady of Yugoslavia, Jovanka Broz, which stated: \\"Dear ƒêorƒëe, please excuse me for not being able to attend your concert.\\" He dedicated a part of one of the concerts to rock and roll. He appeared on the stage dressed in leather, inspired by the image of Gene Vincent, performing foreign rock and roll hits. In this part of the concert he was accompanied by the members of the newly-formed beat band Siluete. In 1961, Marjanoviƒá released his second studio album, Mustafa, through PGP-RTB. He recorded the album with Plavi Ansambl and Predrag Ivanoviƒá Quartet. The album consisted of covers of foreign hits, with the title track being a cover of Bob Azzam's \\"Mustapha\\". The Serbo-Croatian lyrics for the songs were written mostly by Marjanoviƒá himself. In 1962 he appeared on the Belgrade Spring Festival, performing the song \\"Stjuardjesa\\" (\\"Stewardess\\"), which became another one of his hits. The new stage of his career started in 1963, when he went on his first Soviet Union tour. The Soviet audience, uncustomary with the stage performance resembling the performances of Western singers, accepted him immediately. He soon achieved large popularity in Soviet Union and started regularly going on Soviet Union tours. At the peak of his popularity in the Soviet Union he held fifteen concerts in a row on the Lenin Stadium in Moscow, performing every evening in front of approximately 15,000 people. During his tours in Soviet Union he performed French chansons, Italian canzones, but also covers of songs by Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Mamas & the Papas, The Animals and other rock acts. He was awarded for \\"empowerment of friendly relations between Soviet and Yugoslav youth\\" and in 1968 he was proclaimed the Honorary Member of Komsomol. During the 1960s, Marjanoviƒá remained one of the most popular singers in Yugoslavia, releasing hit songs \\"Potra≈æi me u pregraƒëu\\" (\\"Search for Me in the Suburbs\\"), \\"Da ƒçekiƒá imam ja\\" (\\"If I Had a Hammer\\"), \\"Medison u Meksiko\\" (\\"Madison in Mexico\\"), \\"Romana\\" and others. During the decade, he also had several appearances on the Sanremo Music Festival. 1970s and 1980s, retirement During the 1970s and 1980s, Marjanoviƒá's career moved in three main directions: he appeared on pop music festivals, held concerts in Trade Union Hall, where he performed for his faithful fans, nicknamed \\"ƒêokists\\" by the media, and held Soviet Union tours. In 1972, he was awarded with Order of Labor with Silver Wreath by the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito. In 1979 he released the album Hvala vam, prijatelji (Thank You, Friends), which featured songs written for Marjanoviƒá by various authors: \\"Zima u Budimpe≈°ti\\" (\\"Winter in Budapest\\"), written by ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá, \\"Moje ludo srce\\" (\\"My Crazy Heart\\"), written by Mladen Vrane≈°eviƒá, \\"Maestro\\", written by Vojkan Borisavljeviƒá, \\"Gramatika srca\\" (\\"Grammar of the Heart\\"), composed by Aleksandar Koraƒá and with lyrics written by Du≈°an Radoviƒá, \\"Aerodrom\\" (\\"Airport\\") and \\"Samo dugme na kaputu\\" (\\"Just a Button on the Coat\\"), both composed by Kornelije Kovaƒç and with lyrics written by Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá, and others. On a 1982 concert in the Trade Union Hall the audience by voting chose the songs to be released on the 1982 album Dvadeset nikada vi≈°e (Never Again Twenty).Dvadeset nikada vi≈°e at Discogs In 1989, to mark the 30th anniversary of Marjanoviƒá's debut release, PGP-RTB released the songs from Muzika za igru and Mustafa on the compilation album Milord za sva vremena (Milord for Eternity). During these two decades, he also performed in France, (Germany), Israel, Australia and United States of America. In 1990 Marjanoviƒá was awarded by the Order of Friendship of Peoples by Soviet head of state Mikhail Gorbachev. Later that year, Marjanoviƒá made a guest appearance on Lepa Brena concert in Melbourne. While performing the song \\"Mene nema ko da ≈æali\\" (\\"There's No One to Feel Sorry for Me\\"), he suffered a stroke. After the stroke he had difficulty speaking. He partially recovered, but decided to retire from the scene. During the following decades, Marjanoviƒá would not record new material and would appear live occasionally only, usually as a guest on other musicians' concerts.

The Jakkur lake is a 160-acre lake constructed over two centuries ago to cater to the water requirements of the Jakkur village. The lake, which was highly polluted by sewage and waste in 2005, was revived by treating the sewage water which enters the lake and then passing it through a man-made constructed wetland before it flowed through an algae pound that removed most of the nitrates and phosphates. However, in 2016, it was reported that the water quality has worsened due to increased levels of nitrates, phosphates, ammonia and algae. The lake is also a source of drinking water for nearby villages that do not have access to Cauvery water. The lake used to attract a large number of migratory birds from other countries and has seen a fall in this number in recent years.

Early life and family Pitts was born in south-east London, in Lambeth Walk, Lambeth, to Harry Pitts, who died in Parkhurst Prison in 1962, and Nell Taylor, an alcoholic. One brother, Henry \\"Adgie\\" Pitts, became a bank robber who died aged 29 in a car crash. She disowned another brother, Charlie, after he took part in a kidnap plot, for which he received a 15-year jail sentence. By the age of seven, Pitts was stealing milk and bread to provide food for her five siblings, after her mother sold their ration books and her father was imprisoned. She was evacuated to Yorkshire during the Second World War and spent her teenage years in reform schools. She was taught how to shoplift by the Forty Thieves, an all-female group of thieves founded in the Victorian era that persisted into the 1950s. Pitts had several relationships, which produced seven children by three fathers. Five children were from her relationship with Chris Hawkins, who ran a fruit-and-vegetable stall in Hoxton market. Hawkins beat her but stopped after a warning from the Kray twins. After he died, she adopted his name. Career By her early twenties, Pitts was one of the foremost shoplifters in Britain, running teams of \\"hoisters\\" that operated nationally. High-class shops in the West End of London were her main target, in particular Harrods, Harvey Nichols, and Selfridges, as these could supply her with the expensive clothes that she enjoyed wearing and that she could use to make a living. She also operated on continental Europe, taking teams of thieves to Paris and Geneva. Pitts used seven or eight aliases. Her shoplifting techniques included disguising herself using different wigs, stuffing stolen goods under her voluminous skirts, and the use of \\"magic bags\\": carrier bags lined with tin foil that prevented the detection of security tags when she left a shop with stolen goods. When she had finished with one shop she would sometimes leave the stolen goods in a car outside and enter another shop to see what she could steal.Gone Shopping launch pack. Bloomsbury, 2012. She was jailed three times and spent a total of three years in prison. She was one of the few women to escape a British prison by leaving a van that was taking her to court, ostensibly so that her daughter would not be born in prison. She prided herself on never informing or being involved in violence. Death and legacy Pitts died of breast cancer on 16 March 1992. After a blessing at the Roman Catholic Church of the Assumption in Chigwell, she was buried at Lambeth Cemetery in a ¬£5,000 blue Zandra Rhodes dress that the popular press speculated she may have stolen but that her friends insisted was bought. Her remains are interred in a plot near that of her brother Henry. Mourners were driven from her home in Chigwell, Essex, in a fleet of cars that included 15 black Daimlers. The great train robber Buster Edwards attended and messages of condolence were sent by the Kray twins and Ronnie Knight. Tributes were paid at the graveside to the fact that Pitts \\"never grassed\\" (informed). A floral tribute played on the words that she would use when she went to work, \\"Gone Shopping\\".\\"Queen of shoplifters goes to ground with fame in the bag and a fitting epitaph in flowers\\", Duncan Campbell, The Guardian, 26 March 1992, p. 22. She left an estate that was valued for legal purposes at less than ¬£125,000 and was probably much less. In the last years of her life she began to dictate her reminiscences to Lorraine Gamman. These formed the basis for Gamman's biography of Pitts, titled Gone shopping: The story of Shirley Pitts, Queen of thieves, which was published in 1996 by Signet/Penguin (2nd, Bloomsbury, 2012).Gamman, Lorraine.

It begins in the north as a straight extension of the Regerstra√üe, where it is a regular two-lane road until the Tegernseer Platz. At the Tegernseer Platz, a large branch of the Deutsche Post can be found. The building, nicknamed Tela- Post, was built in 1928 in the architectural style New Objectivity. The Hertie-store (which was for many years Karstadt), which was located at the Tegernseer Platz until the summer of 2009, was closed because of insolvency and demolished in 2010. Between 1976 and 2016, a branch of the city library was located across the street. There are efforts to strengthen the local economy and prevent vacancy of retail spaces around the Tegernseer Landstra√üe, which are funded by the federal government. Tegernseer Platz The stretch between Tegernseer Platz and Martin-Luther-Stra√üe accommodates tram tracks, and the traffic is restricted to one-way traffic for motor vehicles and cyclists. Across from the intersection with Martin-Luther-Stra√üe is Germany's first McDonald's branch which has been located there since 1971. Between Martin-Luther-Stra√üe and Candidstra√üe, in the southern direction, the road consists of five lanes (two left-turning, two straight-ahead and one right- turning lane). At the intersection of Candidstra√üe, the Tegernseer Landstra√üe makes a 90-degree curve to the southeast, and straight ahead, the Gr√ºnwalder Stra√üe begins. The part of the road between the intersection with Candidstra√üe at the Gr√ºnwalder Stadion and the St. Quirin Platz, where the Chiemgaustra√üe branches off, is a part of the Mittlerer Ring and dedicated as the Bundesstra√üe B 2R; it is also part of Europastra√üe 54. The McGraw trench facing the city center The Tegernseer Landstra√üe leads, in a southeastern direction, also through the McGraw trench, a section on which the road is lowered down at a length of about 300 m. The upper section serves as a driveway for residents, not the through traffic, and allows a direct access to Stadelheimer Stra√üe. In January 2018, the city council's CSU fraction proposed a cover over the McGraw trench in order to provide more space for the construction of apartments. Also, south of the Stadelheimer Stra√üe junction, the upper and lower parts of the road join back together. Above ground, in No. 210, was the former Reichszeugmeisterei of the SA/NSDAP, the successor institution of the NS-Wirtschaftsstelle located there since 1928/1929 in the barracks, which in the post-war period served the Americans under the name of McGraw-Kaserne. Today, a branch of the Munich Police Department is located there. The main building served as the administrative building of the United States Armed Forces (7th Army - USAREUR) from 1945 until 1992.

She suffered from bone cancer at age 11, uterine cancer at age 22 and finally breast cancer at age 33. Johnson founded the Love Your Sister charity in 2012 with her brother Samuel Johnson, aiming to raise $10 million for cancer research. At the time of her death the charity had raised almost $6 million. She was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia on 7 September 2017 and died the following day, aged 40. Biography Johnson was born in 1977 and grew up with older sister Hilde and younger brother Samuel. Their mother committed suicide when Connie was aged 4. She started at a new school almost every year; her father was a writer and moved around a lot so that he could write. At the age of 22 she met her husband Mike and in 2001 they moved to Canberra where they ran the Book Lore bookshop in Lyneham together. They married in 2004 and Mike took her name. They had two sons; Willoughby in 2006 and Hamilton in 2007. Johnson was first diagnosed with bone cancer in her leg at age 11. At the age of 22, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. Both tumours were detected early which aided successful treatment. In 2010, at the age of 33, after being misdiagnosed by three doctors, Johnson was told she had breast cancer. The cancer spread to her lungs, liver, spine, pelvis and knee. She was given six to twelve months to live. Johnson joined with her brother, Samuel Johnson, to start the Love Your Sister charity on New Years day 2012, and to co-write a book titled Love Your Sister: How far would you go for someone you love? which was published in November 2016. In April 2017 she announced that her body could no longer withstand her medications and she was ceasing all treatment, and withdrew from public life shortly afterwards. Johnson was presented with the Medal of the Order of Australia on 7 September 2017, by the Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove; for services to people with breast cancer. The medal was to be presented on Australia Day 2018, but the ceremony was brought forward due to Johnson's poor health. Johnson's death was announced by Samuel the following day on the Love Your Sister Facebook page. Love Your Sister Johnson started the Love Your Sister Charity on New Years Day 2012 with her brother Samuel. The charity supports the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and aimed to raise $AU10 million for cancer research. In February 2013 Samuel left Melbourne on his unicycle and rode a world record around Australia in an effort to raise one million dollars for Love Your Sister. The ride ended after 364 days in February 2014 and raised almost $1.5 million. The Big Heart Project aimed to break the record for the longest line of coins, but when they were inundated with donations the plans changed; they created a heart that people could fill with buckets of 5 cent coins. The project raised $2.535 million for the charity. $200,000 was donated to The Cancer Support Group (formerly The Eden Monaro Cancer Support Group). Charitable donations received via the Love Your Sister website and the Not Another XXXXing Swear Jar campaign increased the funds raised by the charity to $5.6 million at the time of Johnson's death.

The band's album Shin Jung Hyun & Yup Juns Vol. 1, released in 1974, sold more than one million copies. Its most popular song \\"The Beauty\\" (, Mi-in), was nicknamed \\"the song of thirty million\\" (, referring to South Korea's total population at the time). It was used as background music in the Lee Man-hee film A Girl Who Looks Like the Sun released that year, one of Lee's last before his death in 1975. The band's next album, Shin Jung Hyun & Yup Juns Vol. 2, was an implicit rebuke to the dictator Park Chung-hee: according to Shin's son Shin Daechul, Park had demanded that Shin make a song praising Park, but instead Shin and his fellow band members wrote the lyrics of the album's song \\"Beautiful Rivers and Mountains\\" (, Areumdaun Gangsan) about the beautiful natural landscapes of Korea. This led to increasing troubles for the band. In particular, \\"The Beauty\\" was banned on 9 July 1975, one of 45 songs banned that day by the Park dictatorship under the censorship provisions of the Yusin Constitution, and remained illegal until it was unbanned on 18 August 1987 just after the National Liberation Day celebrations. \\"The Beauty\\" was believed to have become a target for censorship not just due to the political troubles of the band itself and because of the dictatorship's general suspicion of youth culture, but because one line of the lyrics was a popular target for parodies among fans, by replacing \\"see\\" (Î≥¥Í≥†, bogo) with other words: Specifically, one parody replaced bogo with the light verb hago (ÌïòÍ≥†), which could be interpreted as merely obscene (\\"I want to do [her] once\\", etc.), or could be given a political slant by interpreting it as \\"I want to be [president] once, be [president] twice, keep on being [president]\\", a reference to the removal of presidential term limits in the earlier constitution which allowed Park to continue into his second decade as president. On 5 December 1975, the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office applied for an arrest warrant for band leader Shin Jung-hyeon on charges of violating of the Addictive Drugs Control Act (ÏäµÍ¥ÄÏÑ±ÏùòÏïΩÌíàÍ¥ÄÎ¶¨Î≤ï), specifically of having allegedly used marijuana beginning in October 1972, and of having supplied of marijuana to another singer. His trial began on 24 December, and he was forcibly committed to a mental institution for treatment. In January 1976, the Ministry of Culture and Public Information (Î¨∏ÌôîÍ≥µÎ≥¥Î∂Ä) announced an indefinite ban on public performances and album releases by 54 entertainers who had been linked to marijuana, Shin among them.

Biography  After completing his studies at Verviers and Namur, and then in the Vosges department at the Major Seminary of Saint-Di√© and the Faculty of Arts of Nancy, Carl de Nys was ordained priest in 1941 and taught literature and philology at √âpinal for a few years. Fascinated by music, he was immediately encouraged to devote himself to it by Bishop Monseigneur Blanchet, promoted rector of the Institut Catholique de Paris and sensitive to the spiritual influence that musical culture could have on him. From then on, it was in a veritable parallel career of musicologist that de Nys launched himself in the early 1950s, and his many activities in this field made him an essential figure of musical life in France during the second half of the twentieth century. A tireless worker, a methodical researcher, enthusiastic and often inspired, he travelled through the European libraries and exhumed a wealth of unpublished works, shedding light on so many forgotten composers, as well as some lesser-known pages of Bach and his sons, Joseph Haydn and Michael Haydn, and finally Mozart. Fascinated by Baroque and classical literature, he was nevertheless interested in all the repertoires, up to contemporary creation. Thus it was at his request that Andr√© Jolivet wrote in 1956 the oratorio La V√©rit√© de Jeanne.La V√©rit√© de Jeanne on Ircam Always eager to share his discoveries with the general public, he demonstrated remarkable pedagogical qualities and knew how to exploit them in multiple fields. He was the source of many concerts and festivals, including that of Epinal in the early 1950s. From that time onwards, he was also a radio man, producing programs at the Saarl√§ndischer Rundfunk and the Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise; he was thus the host of Sinfonia Sacra with Jean WitoldJean Witold on data.bnf.fr or else with Armand Panigel in the famous '.

Shot  In the photo, Jangju is crawling through muddy ground of the marshes in south of Iran while he is holding a rifle in ready state. The photograph was widely shared and was published in several media outlets both due to the special style of the soldier and it also attracted a lot of attention since the family name of the boy, \\"Jangju\\" meaning Warrior in Persian language was a good fit for the picture. Alfred Yaghobzadeh was working for the Gamma and Associated Press news agencies at the time of capturing the famous photograph. The same photo was used as propaganda for recruiting volunteers by the Iranian authorities during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war and afterwards.  Background  Jangju was a volunteer Basiji. He was killed in February 1984 during Operation Kheibar, which was part of the Battle of the Marshes, when Iran sent soldiers back over the Iraqi border, before they too became bogged down north of Basra.  Funeral and aftermath  The remains of his body was discovered and identified in the former Iran-Iraq war zone and sent back to Tabriz after 34 years on 5 September 2017. On 6 September 2017 the coffin of Hassan Jangju, which was draped in the Iranian flag, was borne through the streets by a huge crowd and laid to rest with full military honours.

Allegations regarding Hassan Rouhani's plagiarism were first raised in 2013 when it was claimed that he had probably \\"lifted\\" sentences from a book by Afghan author, Mohammad Hashim Kamali. Glasgow Caledonian University, Rouhani's graduation school, argued that the sentences were both cited properly. The issue was raised again amid 2017 Iranian presidential election when a student campaign claimed that they had for the first time investigated Rouhani's whole thesis using plagiarism detection tool iThenticate and that chapters one through four of Rouhani‚Äôs thesis had been plagiarized at least 39%, 43%, 40% and 82%, respectively. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Kalantari, a member of Assembly of Experts, Shiraz University faculty member and one of the alleged victims, said that \\"major segments\\" of Chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis had been translated from his book without being referenced. Sadegh Zibakalam, reformist political science professor at University of Tehran, accused Rouhani's rival of politicizing the case right before the elections. Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, head of Iranian Parliament's Commission on Education and Research, said that he had found major plagiarisms in chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis and that the case would be investigated in Education and Research Commission. 50 student-run organizations as well as Shiraz University faculty professors asked Ali Akbar Kalantari to prosecute the case in separate letters. Background According to the Telegraph in 2013, Hassan Rouhani had apparently plagiarized from a book by Afghan author, Mohammad Hashim Kamali. Glasgow Caledonian University said that they had found references to the mentioned book, both within the main body and the bibliography. After the allegations were raised by the western media, Glasgow Caledonian University published the abstracts of Rouhani's Master and PhD thesis. According to Foreign Policy, the sentences \\"...it leaves room for flexibility in the evaluation of its injunctions...The Qur‚Äôan is not specific on the precise value of its injunctions, and it leaves open the possibility that a command in the Qur‚Äôan may sometimes imply an obligation, a recommendation or a mere permissibility\\" and \\"As a characteristic feature of Qur‚Äôanic legislation, it may be stated here that commands and prohibitions in the Qur‚Äôan are expressed in a variety of forms which are often open to interpretation and ijtihad\\" which are found in Rouahni's thesis dated July 1998, were \\"lifted\\" from the work by Hashem Kamali first published in 1991: Sayed Hassan Amin, Rouhani‚Äôs doctoral thesis supervisor, denied the allegations in an interview with BBC Persian and said that there was \\"no doubt about the authenticity of the thesis.\\" 2017 presidential election The allegations were raised again by state news agencies amid the 2017 Iran presidential election. Student campaign A group of Iranian students based in Iran and the United States formed a campaign investigating the case. The campaign published the results of their investigation on their website and on Twitter. The nongovernmental organization Justice and Transparency Watch (DAAD) founded in 2015 by \\"a group of then-parliamentarians and conservative political figures\\" is described on the campaign's website as the backer of the campaign. According to the group, plagiarism detection tool iThenticate was used for the analysis of the thesis and the results reportedly showed that chapters one through four of Rouhani‚Äôs thesis have been plagiarized at least 39%, 43%, 40% and 82%, respectively. According to Keivan Ebrahimi, Iranian PhD student at Iowa State University and a member of the campaign, most parts of the Rouhani's thesis are copied from the works by Ebrahim Kalantari, Ziauddin Sardar, Noel James Coulson, Hamid Enayat, Wael Hallaq, Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi, Patrick Bannerman, Mohammad Hashim Kamali and William Montgomery Watt. In response to a question in this regard, Rouhani said that he had graduated from an international credible university and that he had not achieved his degree in exchange for land. Alef website published the final result of the investigations referring to the student campaign's website, Rouhanithesis. According to the word count results the whole thesis was consisted of 101500 words with 16700, 11000, 9400, 5400, 3000, 2250, 2075 and 1600 words being copied from the works by Ali Akbar Kalantari, Ahmad Hassan, Mohammad Hashim Kamali, Seyyed Abbas Salehi, Jom'e Meqdadi, Wael Hallaq, Chibli Mallat and Morteza Motahhari, respectively. Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor at Tehran University in Rouhani's camp, accused Rouhani's rival of politicizing the case. \\"If [members of the campaign and their backers] claim to be ethical, nonpolitical people, why didn‚Äôt they go after [plagiarism claims] before and [why did they only begin] to spread their accusations right before the election?\\" asked Zibakalam. According to Al- Monitor, the campaign seek \\"both political and academic objectives.\\" In response to the question asking Keivan Ebrahimi why they had raised the allegations right before the elections, he answered that there was no access on their part to the thesis full text from GCU until it was obtained prior to the elections from an Iranian institute affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Science. Prosecution by Ali Akbar Kalantari Ayatollah Ali Akbar Kalantari, a member of Assembly of Experts, said that \\"major segments\\" of Chapter 4 of Rouhani's thesis had been translated from his book \\"without any reference to the original text or the name of the author.\\" Mohammad Farhadi, Minister of Science, denied the allegation while Kalantari described Farhadi's reaction as \\"hasty\\". In a letter to Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, head of Iranian Parliament's Commission on Education and Research, Kalantari urged legal prosecution of what he described as Rouhani's plagiarizing his book. Zahedi said that he had personally put \\"enough time\\" on the \\"strong\\" documents he had been given and that as an academic, and not a politician, he believed that major parts in the fourth chapter of Rouhani's PhD thesis had been plagiarized from Kalantari's book. According to First Vice Chief Justice of Iran, Gholam- Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, the case may be addressed by the Special Clerical Court, if there's a private plaintiff. =Reactions= Various groups of Iranian student activists such as Student Basij and Islamic Society of Students addressed Kalantari by sending letters and asked him to prosecute the case. According to the Student News Network, Twitter hashtag #Plagiarism () became the first trend in Iran in 25 July 2017. On 8 August 2017, faculty professors from Shiraz University publicized a letter they had penned a week earlier to Iranian Parliament's Article 90 Commission along with a 250-page document. They called for action to preserve the rights of their colleague, Ali Akbar Kalantari. On 27 August 2017, they penned a second letter to Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, questioning Rouhani's qualifications to stand a second term as the nation's president.

July 1758 The Royal Barcelona Trading Company to the Indies (; ) also known as the Barcelona Company was a trading company in the 18th century chartered by the Spanish crown, operating from 1755 to 1785, and which had a monopoly on trade to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo and Margarita. The Company provided a legal framework and a focus for capital which enabled Catalan merchants to break free from the restrictions of the Cadiz monopoly on trade with the Indies, provided skills and contacts that enabled the development of free trade between Catalonia and the Americas to flourish after the Company's demise, and contributed to the development of the textile industry which later became the basis of industrialisation in Catalonia.  Historical context  Since 1503, under the Habsburg kings, all trade with America had been conducted through the port of Seville (and after 1717, C√°diz) under a monopoly that prevented other cities, including Barcelona, from trade with the Americas, or the Indies as they were known. Tentatively by the late 17th century Catalan goods had reached the Indies via the Spanish coastal trade to C√°diz and this grew slowly until by the mid 1740s entire ships were beginning to be fitted out in Barcelona for transatlantic commerce. The Barcelona Company was one of a number of chartered companies established by the Bourbon crown in the 18th century, part of the larger Bourbon Reforms, with the intention to reform Spanish commerce with the Americas, to integrate the economies at the peripheries of the American Empire and to reduce English and French piracy and contraband in the Eastern Caribbean. These new companies enjoyed commercial privileges (so sometimes called 'Privileged Companies' in Spanish) and included the Caracas Company, the Honduras Company, the Seville Company and the Havana Company. They strongly resembled the English, Dutch and French trading companies of the 17th century. Trading companies were not the only concerns with royal privileges chartered at this time; a number of were also established.  Activity  The Barcelona Trading Company was granted a monopoly on trade to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo and Margarita as well as being allowed ten annual visits to Guatemala and Honduras, trade with Cuman√° (north eastern Venezuela) and some limited trading with Havana. The Company exported principally wine and brandy and increasingly chintz (or printed calico ) as this industry grew in Barcelona. Imported products included raw cotton, indigo, brazilwood, cocoa, tobacco, sugar amongst others. The raw cotton and dyes assisted in the production of chintz that was then reexported to the Americas as well as the domestic (Spanish peninsula) market. As Ringrose says,  Dissolution  In 1778, King Charles III signed the 'Decree of Free Trade' between Spain and the Americas effectively removing the company's monopoly. The company was further weakened by losing half its ships through the Spanish involvement in the American Revolutionary War. The company was dissolved between 1784 and 1785 and merged with the Caracas Company to form the Royal Philippine Company.  Legacy  The Company provided a legal framework and a vehicle for the concentration of capital necessary to break free of the Cadiz monopoly (which had proven difficult to surmount through the action of individual merchants) and created the conditions that would later allow free trade with the colonies to flourish., These conditions included the focus of a large part of the economic activity of the principality of Catalonia upon trade with the Americas, the integration of the economy with that of the colonies and the building a base of knowledge, skill and commercial contacts amongst merchants who came to consider an Atlantic voyage as an everyday occurrence. The trade with the Americas also encouraged and fed the already growing industry of calico print production and, much later, spinning and weaving of cotton cloth (the was established in Barcelona in 1772 to spin American raw cotton). The textile industry became the basis of industrialisation in Catalonia in the 19th century, although to what extent colonial trade contributed to the industry's growth, there is some debate. In contrast to the greater part of the American empire which achieved independence from Spain in the first decades of the 19th century, Cuba, Santo Domingo and Puerto Rico were amongst those few possessions that remained within the empire. Consequently, the trading relationships with Catalonia continued to build upon those established by the Barcelona Company (Antilles trade with all Spanish ports rising 300% between 1850 and 1890 ) until these territories were finally lost in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898.

Racing only as a two-year-old in 1979 she won two of her five races including the Phoenix Stakes, which was then Ireland's premier race for juveniles. She was also placed in the Queen Mary Stakes and the Prix du Petit Couvert and ended the year as Ireland's top-rated two-year-old filly. She made no impact as a broodmare. Background Smokey Lady was a \\"compact\\" grey mare bred in Ireland. She was sent into training with Dermot Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare. She was ridden in most of her races by Wally Swinburn. She was from the seventh crop of foals sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British- raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Flying Water, Marwell, Rose Bowl and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Smokey Lady's dam A. 1 showed little ability as a racehorse but was a successful broodmare who produced several other winners including Steel Heart and was the female-line ancestor of King of Kings. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season After finishing unplaced on her first appearance, Smokey Lady recorded her first win in a maiden race over five furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in May, taking the race in impressive style by five lengths from Pitmarie. In the following month she was stepped up in class when she was sent to England and started second favourite for the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. She showed good early speed and led the field until the final furlong when she was overtaken and beaten into third place by Abeer and Teacher's Pet. Smokey Lady was then matched against colts in the Phoenix Stakes at Phoenix Park which was at the time the only Group 1 race in Ireland restricted to juveniles. In a finish dominated by fillies she prevailed by a lengths from the odds-on favourite Monroe, with Pitmarie half a length back in third. On 21 October the filly was sent to France and matched against older horses in the Prix du Petit Couvert over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse, a race which saw her start second favourite behind the three-year-old Sigy. She was among the leaders from the start and finished third of the eleven runners behind Manjam and Standaan. In the Irish Free Handicap for 1979, Smokey Lady was assigned a weight of 122 pounds, making her the top-rated two-year-old filly of the year in Ireland. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 109, making her eleven pounds inferior to their top juvenile filly Aryenne. Breeding record Smokey Lady did not race after the end of her two-year-old and was retired to become a broodmare.

The app clicks on web pages that use the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) billing method, and Xafecopy subscribes the phone to a number of services which charge money directly to the user's mobile phone bill. The technology is also able to bypass Captcha systems. Xafecopy has been found using JavaScript file names which was previously used by infamous Ztorg Trojan, triggering speculation of a possibility of code sharing between cyber criminal gangs.  Operation  Xafecopy disguises itself as a useful app, often a battery optimizer. It operates by clicking on web pages with WAP billing system which is a form of mobile payment system charged directly to the mobile bill. The malware works in WAP-enabled android devices over a GPRS or 3G wireless connection and is based on the Ubsod family. It was detected by Kaspersky Lab as Trojan-Clicker-AndroidOS.Xafekopy. Xafecopy receives the WAP billing URL addresses of the web pages through a command-and-control server. Once the URL address is received at the device, it clicks on the WAP billing links, which initiates a WAP session with the server, which then obtains the user's MSISDN and charges directly to the user's mobile carrier bill and subscribes to unwanted paid services. Xafecopy appears to use technology which bypasses captcha systems. According to Kaspersky Lab, it shares significant coding obtained from other significant malware. Modified versions of Xafecopy were also identified to have the capability of sending SMS from the device to premium-rate phone numbers, deleting incoming SMS from the mobile network provider, and hiding alerts about balance deduction by reading incoming messages and checking for words like \\"subscription\\". It is also capable of switching a user from WiFi connection to mobile data, as WAP billing works only when the user is connected to a mobile connection.

The stadium was in use between 1896 and 1915, and was located on the same site as the current Gamla Ullevi stadium. History The stadium was originally built as a combination of velodrome and football stadium by track cycling club G√∂teborgs Velocipedklubb in 1895‚Äì1896. Idrottsplatsen was opened on 28 June 1896, even though the curves of the velodrome were not fully completed until 1907. The centre field could be used for athletics as well, and during winter it was watered and used for ice skating in sub-zero conditions. The venue also featured an indoor tennis court and six outdoor courts, completed in 1901. Idrottsplatsen had one stand with room for 600 seated spectators. But many more could attend events; the wrestling exhibition match in 1896 between GAIS wrestler Carl Gustafsson and Ottoman royal court wrestler Memisch Effendi set a record attendance of 10,000. G√∂teborgs VK merged with IS Lyckans Soldater and Skridskos√§llskapet Norden in 1900 to form the new club G√∂teborgs IF, which took ownership of the venue. They offered IFK G√∂teborg to share the stadium in 1906, which was accepted. Due to a conflict in 1909, IFK temporarily moved to Balders Hage, but moved back to Idrottsplatsen the following year. The Swedish national team made their international debut in July 1908, winning 11‚Äì3 against Norway (who also made their international debut) in front of 2,000‚Äì3,000 people at Idrottsplatsen. Tough competition from Walhalla IP that opened in 1908 gradually worsened the economy of Idrottsplatsen, and plans for a more modern stadium materialised. In 1915, Idrottsplatsen was started to be demolished to make room for its replacement, Ullevi, which opened in 1916.

She co-founded the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association and served as its first president. Early life and education Sarah Burger was born in New York City on November 30, 1836. In 1845, her family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and later, to Cleveland, Ohio. Burger showed an early interest in woman's suffrage when she attended a national suffrage convention in Cleveland at age 14 where she heard talks by Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone, and other national leaders. In 1858, she organized twelve young women to make the first formal application, by women, for admission to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The reply they received was \\"It seems inexpedient, at present, for the University to admit ladies\\". Discussion continued until 1869 when women (but not Stearns) were admitted. Stearns accepted a position as a Greek and Latin teacher in an academy. After a year, she applied to University of Michigan again and was, again, refused. She entered and graduated from the State Normal School in Ypsilanti, Michigan. In 1863, she married Lieutenant Ozora P. Stearns whom she had met 5 years earlier. After marriage, while he was in the army, Sarah was preceptress in a seminary for young women in Monroe, Michigan. She also lectured for the benefit of the Soldiers' Aid Societies and the Sanitary Commission. She was invited to give a lecture to the Theodore Parker Fraternity (a social and religious society) in Boston; her lecture was titled, \\"Wrongs of Women and Their Redress \\". She also taught Freedmen where her husband (now Colonel Stearns) was stationed. Women's suffrage in Minnesota In 1866, the Stearnses moved from Michigan to Rochester, Minnesota, and Sarah continued to give lectures on subjects such as \\"Woman and Home\\" and \\"Woman and the Republic,\\" and wrote newspaper articles on education. Stearns and Mary Colburn (and \\"friends of equality\\") petitioned the legislature for an amendment to strike the word male from the section of the Minnesota State Constitution which enfranchised \\"every male person,\\" as a means to provide women with the right to vote. Stearns and Colburn were given a hearing before a legislative committee in 1867 but, ultimately, the bill failed in committee (by a majority of one) and no action was taken. In 1869, Susan B. Anthony traveled through the Midwest encouraging women to form local affiliates of the National Woman Suffrage Association. After her visit, Stearns and Colburn formed the first suffrage societies in Minnesota: Stearns in Rochester with 50 members and Colburn in Champlin. The Stearnses moved to Duluth, Minnesota, in 1872. Sarah organized another suffrage society, the Duluth Woman Suffrage Circle, and served as its president from 1881‚Äì1893. She supported temperance, served as a member of the Duluth school board for three years, and was the Minnesota vice-president for the Association for the Advancement of Women for several years. Stearns was characterized in a local newspaper as \\"a power in the young community [Duluth] as well as in the state of Minnesota\\". In 1875, the Minnesota constitution was amended to allow women of 21 years or older to vote in \\"any election held for the purpose of choosing any officers of schools, or upon any measure relating to schools, and may also provide that any such woman shall be eligible to hold any office pertaining solely to the management of school\\". Stearns, and other supporters, made no effort to campaign for votes in favor of the amendment because they were afraid that those efforts would simply rouse the opposition. Shortly before the election, Stearns contacted the editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press to request support in his paper; the editor admitted that he had forgotten all about the amendment. Stearns and her colleagues persuaded both political parties to phrase the ballot, \\"For the amendment of Article VII relating to electors‚ÄìYes\\". In order to vote against the amendment, voters had to cross out 'Yes' and write in 'No'. The amendment passed 24,340 to 19,468. As Stearns later stated, \\"our bitterest opponents forgot the question was to be voted upon, and the ignorant classes who could not, or did not read their ballots, voted unthinkingly for the measure\\". After passage of the amendment, Stearns spoke at women's meetings, informing them of their new rights and campaigning for two female candidates from Minneapolis. Stearns was the vice-president from Minnesota for the National Woman Suffrage Association for several years, and hosted Susan B. Anthony when Anthony visited Duluth. When an amendment to allow women to vote on matters relating to prohibition was voted down in 1877, Stearns and other woman leaders became convinced that a statewide organization was needed to move women's issues forward. Fourteen women met in Hastings, Minnesota, in 1881, and formed the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association (MWSA). Stearns became the first president. The association grew to 124 in its first year and doubled in number in the second year. In 1882, Stearns was unanimously re-elected as president of the MWSA at its first annual meeting. In 1883, she stepped down due to ill health but accepted presidency of the Equal Rights League in Duluth. Other activities Stearns played a vital role in the organization of a home for destitute women and children in 1885, which eventually developed into the Duluth Children's Home, and served as president of the society that maintained the home. After 5‚Äì6 years, a new home was built on property donated by two judges (Stearn's husband and Judge Ensign). The funds to build the home were donated by members of the society. Last years and legacy In 1894, the Stearnses moved to California for Ozora's health. Sarah was chair of the Los Angeles Suffrage League in 1900, and she continued to work for women's rights until her death on January 26, 1904. In her obituary, Stearns is called \\"one of the most prominent platform orators in the cause of woman suffrage and temperance\\". In 1996, a memorial garden was built on the grounds of the Minnesota State Capitol, to observe the 75th anniversary of the suffrage movement. The garden exhibit is called Garden of Time: Landscape of Change, and is planted with native flowers and grasses. A monument in the garden lists the names of 25 women active in the movement, including Stearns.

Thomas Krens, former director of the Guggenheim Museum who oversaw the creation of the Gehry- designed Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, and a Mass MoCA founder, is heading the creation of the new museum. The plan calls for an 83,000-square-foot museum to be built at an estimated cost to $65 million, featuring model trains running continuously past scale-models of buildings by notable architects including Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Frank Gehry. It will be built on publicly owned land overlooking a disused rail freight yard; the proposed Museum holds an option to purchase the land. About half of the financing is projected to come from state and local government funds allocated to support the growth of tourism, and half from private donations of which $2.5 million had been raised by August 2017.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It was designed by Ogden, Utah architects St. James, Woods & Co. It has a room on its third floor which was used for dances and other events. The building \\"is significant primarily for its association with the Mormon Church-sponsored Brigham City Mercantile and Manufacturing Association (the Co-op). The Co-op was a highly successful socio-economic system that dominated the local economy during most of its years of operation, 1864-1895. It was also a model for Mormon cooperatives established throughout the Utah Territory in the 1860s-80s. Most of the other co-ops failed quickly, and none approached the level of success attained in Brigham City.\\" A fire at the store on December 19, 1894 contributed to failure of the Co-op in 1895.

She spent time as an expatriate artist specifically in Europe. Burge was a painting companion of Frances Hodgkins who called Maude Burge a \\"charming changeable woman\\" in her published letters. They painted together at the Burge family home in St.Tropez and in Ibiza. Burge's paintings are held in the permanent collection of Auckland Art Gallery, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the National Art Gallery of New Zealand, the Fletcher Trust Collection, the National Library of New Zealand and among private art collectors in the northern and southern hemispheres. Burge exhibited her paintings at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts. Biography Maude Burge was born in Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand. Her career as an artist was part of the Modern Art movement. She created paintings in oils and watercolours. Burge painted portraits of the MƒÅori in a modernist style. While living in Europe she painted still lifes and landscape scenes. In New Zealand Burge was a pupil of James Nairn and trained under C.F. Goldie at his studio in Auckland. Burge painted one of Goldie's favourite early models Ina Te Papatahi, of the NgƒÅpuhi iwi tribe. While painting in Europe, Burge was as a pupil of English watercolourist Fred Mayer and was associated with British artists Frank Brangwyn and Philip Connard. Burge travelled extensively and painted watercolours of still lifes, market scenes and beach scenes in St. Tropez, Morocco and Dalmatia. Burge became a friend and painting companion of fellow New Zealand artist Frances Hodgkins. Hodgkins painted still lifes at Burge's garden in St. Tropez, 1931 and they painted together in Majorca and Ibiza. Hodgkins described Burge in her published letters as a \\"nervy changeable charming woman\\". One of Burge's prominent paintings is an oil on canvas titled 'Portrait of Lady Fergusson'. The subject was her own sister Githa, wife of Admiral Sir James Fergusson, the brother of Sir Charles Fergusson, Governor-General of New Zealand. C.F. Goldie described Burge as being a better portrait painter of the MƒÅori than himself. Burge's work has been sold through The International Art Centre in Parnell, Auckland and at Dunbar Sloane Art Auction house in Wellington. Burge exhibited in the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts under her maiden name, Williams, from 1883‚Äì1906; and then from 1926, under her married name. Burge spent many years abroad until the mid-1930s when she returned to live in New Zealand.

The Evening Post, 20 May 1912, page 3 They lived in Hobson Street, Thorndon, Wellington. The family homestead is now owned and occupied by Queen Margaret College, Wellington. Burge's paternal grandfather was Henry Williams (missionary) who translated the Treaty of Waitangi into MƒÅori language. Burge's maternal grandfather was William Beetham the portrait painter. Burge's paternal grandmother was Marianne Williams the pioneering educator in New Zealand. Maude Burge (n√©e Williams) married her husband George Aylesford Burge in New Zealand, 1909. George was the father of James Burge the English criminal law barrister who played a key role in court during the Profumo Affair. Maude and George travelled widely and lived and painted in locations such as St. Tropez, Cannes, Majorca, Ibiza, Morocco and Dalmatia, before returning to New Zealand in 1937. Mr and Mrs Burge settled at Taupo and than later at Cole Street in Masterton. Maude Burge died there in 1957 at the age of ninety-two and is buried at Masterton cemetery on Archer Street.

Early life Caswall was the son of George Caswall of London and Weybridge, son of Sir George Caswall an MP and banker. He joined the army in the 2nd Foot Guards (Coldstreams) and was Ensign in 1750 and lieutenant and captain in 1756. In 1758 at the Battle of St. Cast, he was wounded with both legs broken by a cannon ball. After being taken prisoner, he was held at St Malo languishing in great pain for four months. He was then brought back to England at great expense, where his wound was healed. Political career Caswall applied for promotion in the army or a government post but obtained neither. In the 1761 general election he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Hertford on the interest of Nathaniel Brassey, his uncle. He continued to seek a salaried government post, but having sold his commission in the army in 1762, he disqualified himself in the King‚Äôs opinion. He married Mary Constantia Rolt on 28 January 1762, daughter and heir of Thomas Rolt of Sacombe Park. Mary's brother Captain Thomas Rolt (1st Foot Guards) the only son of Thomas Rolt, died at the battle at the Battle of St. Cast. In 1768 Caswall was made deputy paymaster of the forces and did not stand at the general election of 1768. In 1771 he was elected MP for Brackley in the interest of the Duke of Bridgwater.

Originally a small auxiliary and self-defense group, QSF grew into relatively large and well-equipped paramilitary force that operated nationwide. Led by Firas Jaz'ah, the Qalamoun Shield Forces were closely affiliated with the 3rd Armoured Division.  History   Early history as Republican Guard auxiliaries  The origins of the Qalamoun Shield Forces lie in a small militia of the same name that was set up in al-Nabek after its capture from rebels during the Battle of Qalamoun (2013). Formed by \\"notables, retired officers and other locals\\" on 9 January 2014, this unit was designated as auxiliaries to the Republican Guard and was supposed to secure areas retaken from rebel groups. A Damascus native named Adel Ibrahim Dellah eventually became commander of the group. In course of 2015, the nascent QSF had significantly grown in numbers (claiming hundreds of members) and expanded its operations: Fighting at the side of the Republican Guard, the militia not only took part in further offensive operations in the western Qalamoun mountains, but also fought in the wider Rif Dimashq Governorate such as at Harasta, where they played a prominent role in retaking territory from insurgent groups. Later into the year, the Qalamoun Shield Forces even sent fighters to take part in the Battle of Aleppo and the Homs offensive (November‚ÄìDecember 2015) against ISIL. During these operations, the group began to closely cooperate with the 3rd Armoured Division, leading to the Qalamoun Shield Forces' loyalties shifting away from the Republican Guard. The Qalamoun Shield Forces also dispatched some troops to fight alongside the Republican Guard in the Siege of Deir ez-Zor (2014‚Äì17). These forces were eventually fully incorporated into the Republican Guard's 104th Brigade. In the first half of 2016, the militia became especially active in the Syrian steppe and Syrian Desert, fighting in the Palmyra offensive (March 2016), the Battle of al-Qaryatayn (March‚ÄìApril 2016) and the Al-Dumayr offensive (April 2016). Around this time, Syrian Army lieutenant colonel Firas Jaz'ah became the \\"general supervisor\\" of the militia, though Adel Ibrahim Dellah continued to serve as military commander of QSF.  Split and service with the 3rd Division  In May 2016, QSF finally split due to the group's divided loyalties: One faction under the militia's old commander Adel Ibrahim Dellah cut all ties with the 3rd Division and formed a new group, the \\"'Homeland Protection Forces\\". The other faction, led by Firas Jaz'ah, remained with the 3rd Division and continued to function under the name \\"Qalamoun Shield Forces\\". This group significantly expanded its recruitment efforts in the wider Qalamoun area, and also began to enlist hundreds of former Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels into its ranks as part of reconciliation agreements. Already by early 2017, some estimated that about 50% or more of QSF consisted of ex- insurgents; others however claimed that the numbers were closer to around 10%. Thus strengthened despite the Homeland Protection Forces' break-off, the Qalamoun Shield Forces further expanded their operations throughout Syria. In the Syrian Desert, QSF helped to defend the Tiyas Military Airbase from ISIL during the Palmyra offensive (December 2016), and then took part in numerous government (counter-)offensives which aimed at reclaiming all of central Syria from the ISIL and various FSA groups: The Eastern Homs offensive (2017), East Hama offensive (2017), the Syrian Desert campaign (May‚ÄìJuly 2017) and the Central Syria campaign (2017). The Qalamoun Shield Forces also helped to stall and/or defeat major rebel offensives in northern Hama Governorate in 2016 and mid-2017, and took part in government operations against rebel and ISIL forces in the Hama-Idlib-Aleppo Governorates border region in late 2017. Meanwhile, QSF continued to be active in its core regions in southwestern Syria, where it aided the government conquest of the Barada river valley in early 2017, and closely cooperated with Hezbollah to destroy the last holdouts of Tahrir al- Sham, the Syrian opposition, and ISIL at the Lebanese border. In course of these operations in the Qalamun Mountains, QSF recruited more ex-rebels into its ranks, allegedly promising some of them that they would only have to serve in their own home areas. Despite this, pro-rebel media claimed that QSF later forced several of these ex-rebels (from al-Tall) to fight against ISIL in the eastern desert. On 30 December 2017, QSF also sent one of its battalions to take part in the Battle of Harasta. In course of this battle, one Qalamoun Shield contingent which consisted of ex-rebels reportedly defected back to local insurgents, resulting in a temporary crisis for the government troops. As result of this event, QSF commander Firas Jaz'ah was dismissed by the 3rd Division.  Dissolution  From 2018, the Syrian government increasingly attempted to demobilize loyalist militias, fully integrate them into the regular armed forces, or reduce their quasi-autonomous powers in other ways. The Qalamoun Shield Forces were among the units affected by this development. In August 2018, the Political Security Directorate reportedly removed the militia's armed presence from al-Tall, suspended its local commander Nasir Shamu, and sent its fighters to Deir ez-Zor, where they would fight ISIL. QSF garrisons in other villages of the Qalamoun Mountains were allegedly sent to al-Qutayfah, where they were integrated into the 3rd Division. By fall 2018, the Syrian government fully dissolved the group, along with the Ba'ath Brigades and other pro-government paramilitary formations. The majority of its members entered into service with the regular 3rd Armoured Division. Despite this, QSF maintained at least some cohesion as separate unit within the 3rd Division.  Organization, support and funding  The Qalamoun Shield Forces were led by Firas Jaz'ah, a lieutenant colonel who is closely affiliated with the 3rd Division, and were organized into several sub-units according to their places of origin. Accordingly, the group maintains numerous bases in the region, most notably at al-Nabek and Yabroud. Though most of the militia's fighters were from the wider Qalamoun region, they were known to also have members from Damascus and the Golan Heights. In their core areas, QSF sometimes acts as police force, and also maintains posts along the border to Lebanon, most notably at Flitah. Though QSF was most closely connected to the 3rd Division, it never completely separated from the Republican Guard and also maintains links with the Air Force Intelligence and the Military Intelligence Directorates, as well as the Lebanese Hezbollah. The Military Intelligence Directorate and businessman George Haswani provided funding to the group. The Russian International Affairs Council claimed in 2017 that QSF had joined the Syrian Army's Fifth Corps. Other sources did not mention this, and it remains unclear whether the militia was actually part of the Fifth Corps at any point. The Qalamoun Shield Forces were relatively well equipped, using technicals, 9M113 Konkurs anti-tank missile, and Syrian \\"Bourkan\\" (Vulcano) rockets. In early 2017, all fighters of QSF were trained and equipped by the Russian Armed Forces. In regard to its combat capabilities, the QSF has been characterized by pro-government media both as auxiliary force for the regular army and as rapid reaction force.

Early life Stanley was born in Egham, near Windsor, England, the son of William Sexton and Ann Stanley. Sexton, who was the organist at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle (1801‚Äì1824), married Ann in 1819. After Sexton's death, Ann married William Best (1803‚Äì1880) in 1827. Best was an oboist or trumpeter with the King's Band (under the control of the Master of the King's Musick). Ann died on 14 May 1828, one month after giving birth to Stanley's half-sister, Emma.Edmund H Fellowes and Elizabeth R Poyser (eds), The Baptism, Marriage and Burial Registers of St George's Chapel, Windsor (1957) p. 44, p. 253. This left Stanley and two younger sisters in Best‚Äôs care. Stanley, under the name of Sexton, was a member of the choir of St George's Chapel, and is said to have sung at the funeral of King George IV there in 1830. Recognised as a musical prodigy at an early age (he could play complex compositions on the piano at sight), his step-father provided some instruction but, having a large family to support, could not afford the training Stanley required. By the age of 9 he composed a series of variations on \\"God Save the King\\".Windsor and Eton Express, 9 January 1830, p. 3. His step-father's connections with the Royal Household no doubt got him the opportunity to perform his own compositions before Queen Adelaide. In 1836, under his mother's name Stanley, he joined the 80th Regiment of Foot, which was given the duty of escorting convict transports to Australia and he arrived in Sydney in 1837. He was discharged from the Regiment in 1840. Australian career One of Stanley's earliest piano performances in Sydney was at the Royal Hotel on 17 October 1838. A concerto by Henri Herz showed him \\"at once to be a master of this instrument\\". He accompanied many visiting performers, including Sara Flower, Miska Hauser, and Anna Bishop. He was a church organist at a number of Sydney Anglican churches, including St John's, Parramatta, St Andrew's pro-cathedral, St Barnabas, Broadway, and Christ Church St Laurence (1870‚Äì1882).

The book challenges the hereditarians' argument that IQ is entirely or almost entirely heritable, and argues that nonhereditary factors play a more significant role than hereditarians assert. It also recommends how to tutor children so as to maximize their intelligence. The book also argues that IQ scores are a valid, though imperfect, indicator of general intelligence, while criticizing some of the assertions made about such scores in the 1994 book The Bell Curve. The book's appendix argues that racial differences in IQ are entirely due to environmental factors. Reviews Writing for The New York Times, philosopher Jim Holt described the book as \\"a meticulous and eye-opening critique of hereditarianism.\\" Psychologist Earl B. Hunt reviewed the book in the journal Intelligence, stating that \\"Nisbett is a very good writer, but he is a combative writer\\", and while \\"Nisbett is writing for a general audience\\" and \\"does so very well\\", Hunt argues that \\"Nisbett...goes too far in attacking discussions of the genetics of intelligence\\", that Nisbett's argument against the genetic origins of racial and ethnic differences was weakened by citing research on parenting practices without \\"[considering] the possibility that these practices may themselves be influenced by the parental genotype\\", and that Nisbett repeatedly attributed positions to unnamed \\"experts\\" without citation. Hunt concluded that \\"Presenting scientific findings, including controversies, to the general public is an honorable and important endeavor. In my opinion that goal is better served if the writer is specific about who said what, where, and is careful not to overstate his or her case.\\" Another review of the book published in Personality and Individual Differences by psychologist James J. Lee concluded that \\"Nisbett's arguments are consistently overstated or unsound\\" with regard to the heritability and mutability of IQ and racial differences in IQ. In Gifted Child Quarterly, Wendy Johnson described the book as \\"a fascinating example of a scholarly exercise in wishful thinking\\", and criticized Nisbett for ignoring studies with results different from those that he cites, disregarding the importance of replication, and forgetting the limitations and caveats raised by the authors that he cites.

He is the deputy director of the party's Machine Building Industry Department (MBID) and plays a key part in the country's nuclear weapons program. Hong rose to prominence after the 2011 death of Kim Jong-il and succession of Kim Jong-un, after which he has supervised various weapons tests, including the 2013 and January 2016 North Korean nuclear tests. Hong's involvement in weapons development has landed him on international sanctions lists. Career Hong was born on 1 January 1942. He was educated in Central and Eastern Europe, and possibly in the Soviet Union too. Hong plays an important role in North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and space programs. While Hong's responsibility includes conventional weapons, his work focuses on the nuclear weapons program in particular. Hong was formerly the chief engineer at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. Currently he is the deputy director of the party's Machine Building Industry Department (MBID), where he has worked since the mid-2000s. Since 2010, he has been the number two man of Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) secretary Pak To-chun. Hong's background is in manufacture and production rather than development and research, as opposed to his superior in the MBID, Ju Kyu-chang. Hong's career took off in earnest after the 2011 death of Kim Jong-il, the country's leader, and the succession of Kim Jong-un. Hong was number 126 on the funeral committee list of Kim Jong-il. Since 2012, he has accompanied Kim on the occasion of various rocket test launches, and on on-the-spot guidance tours since the beginning of 2013. , Hong is an alternate member of the Central Committee of the WPK. Hong played a key part supervising the 2013 and January 2016 North Korean nuclear tests. He has appeared in the North Korean media in connection to those tests, the December 2012 launch of the Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-3 satellite, and the country's 2017 nuclear test. Hong and his fellow associate in the nuclear weapons program, Ri Hong-sop, are known collectively as North Korea's \\"nuclear duo\\". The two were the first in line to receive a medal from Kim Jong-un for success in the January 2016 test. Hong's role in the nuclear program has landed him on the sanctions list of either the United Nations, United States, or South Korea. The European Union has added Hong on its \\"list of persons and entities responsible for the DPRK's nuclear- related, ballistic-missile-related or other weapons of mass destruction- related programmes or persons or entities acting on their behalf or at their direction, or entities owned or controlled by them, subject to restrictive measures\\". According to professor Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, Hong is \\"spearheading the nuclear development programme as a senior party official\\".

The highest are at Crackington Haven at 735 ft high. These cliffs are noted by students of geology due to the comparative ease of viewing otherwise hidden rock formations on the exposed faces.

Biography A native of Grinnell, Iowa, Kelsey was educated at Iowa College, Andover Theological Seminary, the University of G√∂ttingen, and the University of Pennsylvania. He began his career as a social worker in Helena, Montana in 1895, before moving to do the same job in Buffalo, New York, Boston, and Chicago. In 1903, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, and joined their faculty as an instructor the same year. He became an assistant professor there in 1904, and a full professor in 1907. From 1913 to 1925, he was the vice president of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and served as its secretary for many years. Work Kelsey's best known book is The Negro Farmer, originally published as his Ph.D. thesis in 1903. It argued that African American farmers were incompetent, in line with mainstream stereotypes at the time. He became active in the child welfare movement in the early 1900s. He helped establish the Philadelphia Training School for Social Work in 1908 and served as its consulting director for the following year. This school later became the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, which is one of the most prestigious social work programs in the United States. Though he originally believed in a Lamarckian view of human characteristics, this changed starting in 1907. That year, he became a prominent proponent of the Boasian view that all races were approximately equal in their mental ability, and that racial differences were \\"largely superficial\\".

Moore Chapin Sallie Flournoy Moore Chapin (March 30, 1830 - April 19, 1896) was an American author and temperance worker. Early life Sarah (\\"Sallie\\") Flournoy Moore was born on March 30, 1830, in Charleston, South Carolina. Her maternal ancestors, Elizabeth Martha Vigneron Simons, were Huguenots, who came to the Colonies in 1685 and settled in Rhode Island. Her two great-grandfathers, Vigneron and Tousager, were killed in the Revolutionary War. On her father's side, George Washington Moore, the origins were Scots from Northern Ireland. Her father was a Methodist minister of independent means but lost his home in Charleston fire of 1838, and he moved to the northern part of the State. Moore's father died in the pulpit at a union camp meeting, during the Civil War, after receiving a dispatch announcing the death of his son in a battle. Sallie Moore's sister, Georgia, was a writer and married Felix G. De Fontaine, a South Carolina journalist. Moore was reared and educated in Cokesbury, South Carolina, where she attended one of the best academy in the state. Career Sallie F. Chapin, Northern Illinois University Digital Library From early childhood she showed a fondness and talent for authorship. Chapin wrote much, but she published only one book, Fitzhugh St. Clair, the South Carolina Rebel Boy; or, It Is No Crime to Be Born a Gentleman (1872), dedicated to the children of the Confederacy. The war broke her family fortune: Leonard Chapin enlisted in the Fifth South Carolina Cavalry in 1861 and he served until October 1864, when he was wounded. He died in 1879 after the conflict ended. During the Civil War Sallie Chapin was a supporter of the Confederacy; she was president of the Soldiers' Relief Society and of the Ladies' Auxiliary Christian Association and worked day and night in the hospitals. After the war, she was active in the Ladies' Memorial Association and as president of the Ladies' Christian Association she was instrumental in saving the local YMCA from extinction. After attending a convention at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, in 1880, Chapin became involved in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In 1880 she organized the Charleston Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the first in the state and served as first State president elected in 1883, and she did much to extend that order in the South, where conservatism hindered the work for a long time. In 1881 she attended the convention in Washington, D. C., where she made a brilliant reply to the address of welcome on behalf of the South, ending with a telling poem setting forth the intentions of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She believed in prohibition as the remedy for intemperance. She was a forcible and brilliant writer and conversationalist. In the Chicago Woman's Christian Temperance Union convention, in 1882, when the Prohibition Home Protection Party was formed, she was made a member of the executive committee, and by pen and voice she popularized that movement in the South. She was at one time president of the Woman's Press Association of the South. In 1888 she campaigned to open a State Industrial School for Girls in South Carolina; her effort led to the opening of the South Carolina Industrial and Winthrop Normal College, later Winthrop University. At first against Women's suffrage in the United States, by 1891 she changed her position and avowed her support. In 1895, already burdened by a failing health, Chapin sent a petition to the State Constitutional Convention to raise the statutory age of consent for women to eighteen years (it was at the time set to ten years). The new constitution raised the age of consent to sixteen years. Personal life French Huguenot Church On August 12, 1847, Sallie Moore married Leonard Chapin while she was still a girl, and her married life was singularly happy. Her husband, of a prominent family of Springfield, Massachusetts, was one of the founders of YMCA of Charleston, and one of its chief officers for years. The Chapins adopted Elizabeth Vigneron, the daughter of Sallie Chapin's brother, James O.A. Moore. They also adopted George Mendenhall Chapin; George & Son, edited by Nancy Lu Wilson Rose in 2009, are the letters, poetry and diary of George Mendenhall Chapin and describes the difficult relationship with his adoptive mother, Sallie Chapin. George's son, Thurston Adger Wilson, was to become a leading figure in the North Carolina labor movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Sallie Chapin died on April 19, 1896. Her funeral was held at the Huguenot Church in Charleston and she was buried beside her husband in the Magnolia Cemetery (Charleston, South Carolina). Legacy The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union erected a granite monument over her grave at Magnolia Cemetery and in 1904 a drinking fountain at a busy intersection in Charleston was set up in her memory.

He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at birth, due to a lack of oxygen causing brain damage. He attended St. Mary's Primary School. In his home town of Reddish, where he grew up as a child. Joshua was born to parents Gary Howard and Yvonne Howard, after leaving Primary Education, Joshua went on to study at Reddish Vale High School and then processing on to Loreto College. Where he studied Media Studies as well as Film Studies.Athletics was not the only sport Howard took part in. Basketball was also one of Howard's favourite sports and at the age of 8 he Join his local team \\"TV Sharks\\". When Joshua was born his parents were told that he would not be able to live the life of a normal child, That encouraged them to push their son to the limits and always ensure he was staying active and healthy. Like many children, Joshua had to undergo speech therapy to strengthen his speech and also had eye sight issues causing him to have to wear an eye patch for most of his younger years.  Athletic career  Howard first became involved with the sport at a late stage when he was aged 11. His first club was Manchester Harriers, based at Sports City, Manchester. Howard got involved in multiple sports including football and basketball, he trained with Manchester Harriers for four years mainly focusing on the 100m and 200m events. In late 2015, after competing in no competitions, he joined Stockport Harriers where he was introduced to the long jump by Joe Frost. On 5 December, Howard competed in his first long jump competition at Loughborough University, securing a jump of 4.48m, which saw him break the T38 British record. On 30 January 2016, Howard went back to Loughborough University to compete in the 60m (securing a time of 8.36 seconds) including long jump, where he beat the British Athletics Paralympic Entry Standard with a first round jump of 5.09m.

She was probably the first woman in New Zealand to have been employed by a newspaper, editing the \\"Ladies' Page\\" of The Canterbury Times from May 1894. Biography Born in Christchurch on 25 November 1862, Dolce Ann Cabot was the daughter of Thomas Cabot, a farmer and teacher from Jersey, and his wife Louisa Augusta Kunkel of German extraction. She was brought up on the family farm at Otipua near Timaru where she was first educated privately. After spending two years at Christchurch Girls' High School (1878‚Äì80), she studied teacher training at Christchurch Normal School. She later became an extramural student at Canterbury College but did not complete the degree course. Cabot taught at Timaru Main School from 1880 to 1891. On the basis of a number of articles on woman's suffrage, she was employed by The Canterbury Times', a Christchurch newspaper, where she edited the Ladies' Page from 1894 to 1907. It is believed she was the first woman to join the staff of a New Zealand newspaper. Initially an ardent suffragist, her editorial emphasis was on education, good health and Christian values as priorities for women's successful development but she denounced child marriage in India and the wearing of sealskin coats. As time went by, she was less emphatic about the extension of women's rights, turning to the importance of a woman's role as a housewife and a mother. On 30 October 1907, she married Andrew Duncan, a station master. She left The Canterbury Times, moving with her husband to Greymouth (1910), Wellington (1912) and Auckland (1915). In 1922, she helped to launch Auckland's Ladies' Mirror, but only published three articles in the magazine. By and large, while married she discontinued her interest in writing and feminism, devoting her efforts to raising her seven stepchildren. On Duncan's retirement, the couple moved to Manurewa (1922) In 1928, they returned to Christchurch (1935) where Duncan died in 1935. Dulce Ann Cabot died in Christchurch on 31 May 1943.

Early life Victor Kraft was born Victor Hugo Etler on August 8, 1915, in Oneonta, New York, the son of Samuel Etler (born in New York City) and Bella Kraftsov (emigrated from Alexandrovsk, Russia). Kraft attended Public School 19 and DeWitt Clinton High School. He was a violinist prodigy and gave concerts as a child, later attending Juilliard School. He studied composition under Roger Sessions. He left music to pursue photography at the urging of Aaron Copland. Kraft and Aaron Copland met in 1932, when Kraft was 16 years old, and had a close relationship until Kraft's death in 1976. Copland called Kraft his \\"pupil, companion, secretary and friend.\\" In 1936 Kraft studied photography at the Santuario de Ocotlan in Tlaxcala and from December 1936 to April 1937 he covered the Spanish Civil War as a photojournalist for Louis Aragon's Ce Soir Career Victor Kraft contributed photographs to prominent publications like Life Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Junior Bazaar, The New York Times, Look and the French art journal L'Oeil. His portraits include, other than Aaron Copland, composers and performers of the American music scene, including Leonard Bernstein, Paul Bowles, Edwin Denby, Lukas Foss, Erik Johns, William Kapell, Dmitri Mitropoulos, and Robert Shaw. He also documented the Tanglewood Music Festival in the 1940s. During World War II he studied under Margaret Bourke- White and managed a concert tour for Prince George Chavchavadze. From 1945 to 1947 he worked for Harper's Bazaar, but he did not like it and was fired. During all his career as photographer, Kraft was also paid by Copland to be his secretary and chauffeur, and they lived together at Bernardsville, Ridgefield, Sneden's Landing, Ossining and Cortlandt Manor. They also travelled to Bemidji, Hollywood, Mexico and Cuba. A handsome man, with dark brown-hair and blue-gray eyes, Kraft posed for Cecil Beaton and Carl Van Vechten. Personal life The relationship between Copland and Kraft remained unknown to the general public until Copland's death in 1990. When Bernstein urged an aging Copland to come out, Copland replied: \\"I think I'll leave that to you, boy.\\" Victor Kraft traveled in Mexico in the 1930s and in Brazil from 1951 to 1953. In 1951 Kraft married Pearl Kazin, writer and sister of Alfred Kazin, a literary critic. The marriage lasted a few months. In 1960 Kraft married Rheba Robinson, a nurse. They moved to Croton-on-Hudson and Kraft found a house for Copland in near Cortlandt Manor. Copland was the godfather of Kraft's only child Jeremy Aaron, who was mentally handicapped. Kraft did not accept the situation and in 1968 he left his wife and took Jeremy with him, travelling around the world for eight years. Kraft died of a heart attack on July 2, 1976, and Jeremy returned to live with his mother. When Copland died in 1990, he left $25,000 ($45,110.61 in 2017) to Jeremy's mother, \\"to be used for the support and maintenance of my godson, Jeremy Aaron Kraft\\", the larger sum he left aside from that to his secretary, David Walker.

The visible spectrum is about 390 to 700 nm and the atlas covers from 361.2 to 877.1 nm (plus an appendix) so that the atlas has some coverage of the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum of sunlight. The atlas, compiled by Minnaert and his students Mulders and Houtgast, was published in 1940 shortly before the WWII invasion of the Netherlands. History In the early nineteenth century, Joseph von Fraunhofer made the first systematic inventory of spectral lines in sunlight. Full understanding of the significance of Fraunhofer lines required a huge amount of pioneering research in astrophysics and quantum theory. Cecilia Payne (1925) demonstrated that variations in stellar line strengths can be explained by the Saha ionization equation. Payne's work lead to a major study of the chemical abundances in the solar atmosphere undertaken by H. N. Russell, Walter S. Adams, and Charlotte Moore. Around 1930, the procedures developed by Russell, Adams, and Moore were adapted by Minnaert and Mulders for determining chemical abundances in stellar photospheres.

Neumann served for four years on the OECD's Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, and is a current consultant to UN Women on gender-based approaches to preventing and countering violent extremism. She is the author of the 2017 book Blood Profits: How American Consumers Unwittingly Fund Terrorists, as well as its 2018 Brazilian edition, Lucros de Sangue. During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, a plenary session of the Venezuelan National Assembly approved her appointment as ambassador for the acting President Juan Guaid√≥. She was appointed Ambassador and Chief of Mission for Venezuela to the Court of St. James's in the United Kingdom. The administration of Nicol√°s Maduro does not recognize Guaido's diplomats. In 2020, Neumann was a central figure in the historic (London) High Court decision that \\"unequivocally\\" recognized the legitimacy of the presidency of Juan Guaid√≥ over that of Nicol√°s Maduro. Early life Vanessa Neumann was born in Caracas, Venezuela to Michal (Miguel) Neumann (1947-1992) and Antonia Donnelly (1947-2015). Miguel Neumann was the son of entrepreneurs Hans and Milada Neumann, Jews who emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Venezuela in 1949. Antonia Donnelly de Neumann was an American of Irish and Italian descent. Neumann's grandfather, Hans Neumann, co-founded Corimon (Corporaci√≥n Industrial Montana), which had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange on March 23, 1993, and Fundaci√≥n Neumann, a philanthropic foundation with the twin missions of cultural education and poverty alleviation programs. They also established the Instituto de Dise√±o Neumann, and were co-founders of the and the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administraci√≥n (IESA), which, under the guidance of Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, taught American business administration. For a quarter century, Hans Neumann was also the major shareholder of the Mustique Company, which owns the island of Mustique. He also owned two newspapers in Venezuela: the English-language The Daily Journal, and Tal Cual. Mila Neumann was given the Order of Francisco de Miranda. Miguel Neumann founded Intercomunica, which produced a television series interviewing political leaders on the world stage and a series of books on Venezuelan cinema and culture. Miguel Neumann also owned the Spanish winery Vega Sicilia. As a child in Caracas, Neumann was educated at the Santiago de Le√≥n and then the Humboldt Schule, where she learned German.  Professional career  Neumann received her B.A. (1994), M.A. (1998), M.Phil. (2000), and Ph.D. (2004) from Columbia University, where she submitted her doctoral dissertation, \\"Autonomy and Legitimacy of States: A Critical Approach to Foreign Intervention,\\" under the tutelage of Rawlsian scholar Thomas Pogge. In the 1990s, Neumann worked as a journalist in Caracas for English-language newspaper The Daily Journal, and then in corporate planning and finance at Venezuelan petrochemicals conglomerate Corimon, the time of its ADR listing on the NYSE. After receiving her B.A.in 1994, she interned under Venezuela's Minister Counselor for Petroleum Affairs at the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, DC, and was part of the team that brought the first case before the World Trade Organization. She then returned to the private sector and New York City to work as a purchasing agent at Blue Channel Chemicals, which negotiated bulk purchases of raw materials for Corimon. While pursuing her doctorate, she volunteered for UNICEF for four years, starting in 2001, raising funds from individual and corporate donors and traveling to Tanzania to coordinate with the local health administration on tetanus vaccinations. At the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics (CAPPE) in Canberra, Australia, in 2006, she supported Thomas Pogge's research into reform of the global institutional order for the alleviation of extreme poverty. While working as adjunct assistant professor of philosophy at Hunter College of The City University of New York, she was also an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, where she conducted research into Latin American security, particularly the role of Venezuela in providing haven and funding for the Colombian FARC guerrilla movement. She became editor-at-large for Diplomat, a UK magazine on diplomacy in the UK and EU. In 2009 - 2010, Neumann worked in the field in Colombia on the reintegration of paramilitaries. In 2013, the year Vanessa Neumann, Inc. became Asymmetrica, Neumann was the academic reviewer for the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) teaching text on counterinsurgency in Colombia. Neumann's academic talks are centered on three areas of research: Venezuela, crime-terror pipelines, and foreign investment (particularly from China) in the Latin American energy sector. She is also a cited expert on illicit financial flows from Chinese counterfeiting. Neumann is a commentator on politics and a vocal critic of the Hugo Ch√°vez and Nicol√°s Maduro regimes, and she cites organized crime conducted by them as a cause of oppression in her native Venezuela. Her book Blood Profits: How American Consumers Unwittingly Fund Terrorists has drawn support from exiled Venezuelan opposition leaders and she cites organized crime by the Maduro regime as a cause of the economic collapse and human rights violations in her native Venezuela. Neumann has published articles in The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Beast, The (London) Sunday Times, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Weekly Standard, Standpoint and many other publications. She appears regularly on CNN, CNNE, Fox Business, Al Jazeera, NTN24, GloboTV, and other networks. She is a regular guest on Varney & Co..

Neumann was a central figure in a landmark trial on who controls Venezuela's national gold reserves held at the Bank of England (Nicol√°s Maduro or Juan Guaid√≥) that took place in London's High Court, 22-25 June 2020. On the day the trial started, Neumann stated clearly the purpose of the trial: ‚ÄúThe gold in the vaults in the Bank of England is our national reserves. It belongs to our people, to secure our nation‚Äôs future.‚Äù On 2 July 2020, Justice Nigel Teare issued his decision: Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom \\"unequivocally\\" recognizes Juan Guaid√≥ as the president of Venezuela. In The Wall Street Journal, Juan Guaid√≥ stated: ‚ÄúThis is a grand victory for us in the area of international law,\\" and Neumann stated: \\"It‚Äôs a national reserve, it‚Äôs safeguarded for the future, for the reconstruction of the country in the democratic system.‚Äù To the Financial Times, Neumann declared: \\"The verdict is a victory for the people of Venezuela and for the rule of law more generally.

The archaeology of Indonesia is the study of the archaeology of the archipelagic realm that today forms the nation of Indonesia, stretching from prehistory through almost two millennia of documented history. The ancient Indonesian archipelago was a geographical maritime bridge between the political and cultural centers of Ancient India and Imperial China, and is notable as a part of ancient Maritime Silk Road. The first government institution of archaeology was officially formed in 1913 with the establishment of Oudheidkundige Dienst in Nederlandsch-Indi√´ (Archaeological Service in the Dutch East Indies) under Professor Dr. N.J. Kromm. Today, the national institution of archaeology in Indonesia is the Pusat Arkeologi Nasional (National Archaeological Center). History Early period During the early period of archaeological discovery in Indonesia, from the 16th to the 18th century, ancient statues, temples, ruins and other archaeological sites and artifacts were usually left intact, undisturbed by locals. This was mainly due to local taboo and superstitious beliefs connecting statues and ancient ruins with spirits that might caused misfortune. For example, two old Javanese chronicles (babad) from the 18th century mention cases of bad luck associated with \\"the mountain of statues\\", which was actually the ruins of the Borobudur Buddhist monument. According to the Babad Tanah Jawi, the monument was a fatal factor for Mas Dana, a rebel who revolted against PakubuwonoI, the king of Mataram in 1709.Soekmono (1976), page 4. It was recorded that the \\"Redi Borobudur\\" hill was besieged and the insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by the king. In the Babad Mataram (or the History of the Mataram Kingdom), the monument was associated with the misfortune of Prince Monconagoro, the crown prince of the Yogyakarta Sultanate in 1757.Soekmono (1976), page 5. In spite of a taboo against visiting the monument, \\"he took what is written as the knight who was captured in a cage (a Buddha statue in one of the perforated stupas)\\". Upon returning to his palace, he fell ill and died a day later. Another example: the Prambanan and Sewu temple compound is connected to the Javanese legend of Roro Jonggrang; a wondrous folklore about a multitude of demons that built almost a thousand temples, and a prince who cursed a beautiful but cunning princess causing her to become a stone statue. Nevertheless, several Javanese Keratons did collect archaeological artifacts, including Hindu-Buddhist statues. For example, Keraton Surakarta, Keraton Yogyakarta, and Mangkunegaran collected archaeological artifacts in their palace museums. In areas where the Hindu faith survived, especially Bali, archaeological sites such as Goa Gajah cave sanctuary and the Gunung Kawi temples still served their original religious purposes as sacred places of worship. Dutch East Indies period Hindu- Buddhist sculptures in the Museum of the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (today the National Museum of Indonesia), Batavia, c.1896 Formal archaeological study in Indonesia has its roots in 18th-century Batavia, when a group of Dutch intellectuals established a scientific institution under the name Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, (Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences) on 24April 1778. This private body had the aim of promoting research in the field of arts and sciences, especially in history, archaeology, ethnography and physics, and publishing the various findings. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the Governor General of British Java (1811 to 1816) had a personal interest in the history, culture, and the antiquity of ancient Java, writing The History of Java, which was published in 1817.Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles: The History of Java; Black, Parbury and Allen for the Hon. East India Company 1817; reprinted in the Cambridge Library Collection, 2010 During his administration, the ancient ruins of Borobudur, Prambanan and Trowulan came to light. This sparked a wider interest in Javanese archaeology. A number of temple ruins were surveyed, recorded and catalogued systematically for the first time. However, by the 19th century, the sudden surge of interest in Javanese art had led to the looting of archaeological sites by \\"souvenir hunters\\" and thieves. This period saw the decapitation of a Buddha's head at Borobudur. Of the original 504 ancient Buddha statues in Borobudur, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless), and 43 are missing. The looted Borobudur Buddhas' heads were mostly sold abroad, ending up in private collections or acquired by Western museums such as the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and The British Museum in London. In 1901, the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies set up the Commissie in Nederlandsch Indie voor Oudheidkundige Onderzoek van Java en Madoera, headed by Dr J. L. A. Brandes. It was officially recognized on 14June 1913, with the formation of the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Nederlandsch-Indi√´ (Archaeological Service of the Dutch East Indies), often abbreviated as \\"OD\\", under Professor Dr. N.J. Kromm. Kromm is credited as the pioneer who established the organizational foundation of archaeological study in the East Indies. The object of this was to attempt to ensure that every archaeological find, discovery, exploration and study was conducted and recorded correctly and in accord with the scientific approach of modern archaeology. During Kromm's administration, numbers of journals, books and catalogues were composed and published which systematically recorded the archaeological finds in the colony. Several initial restoration works on the temple ruins of Java were also conducted during this period. Republic of Indonesia period After the turbulent period of World War II Pacific War (1941‚Äì45) and the ensuing Indonesian Revolution (1945‚Äì49) the Oudheidkundige Dienst (\\"OD\\") was nationalized by the newly recognized United States of Indonesia in 1950 as Djawatan Poerbakala Repoeblik Indonesia Serikat (Archaeological Service of the United States of Indonesia). In 1951, the organization of Djawatan Purbakala was improved as Dinas Purbakala as a part of Djawatan Kebudajaan Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudajaan (Cultural Service of Department of Education and Culture), with independent archaeological offices in Makassar, Prambanan and Bali. In 1953, two of the first native Indonesian archaeologists graduated, one of them was R. Soekmono, who subsequently succeeded Bernet Kemper as the chief of Djawatan Poerbakala Repoeblik Indonesia. Later the national archaeological institution changed to Lembaga Poerbakala dan Peninggalan Nasional (Institute of Archaeology and National Heritage) or LPPN. In 1975 the LPPN was separated into two institutions: Direktorat Pemeliharaan dan Pelestarian Peninggalan Sejarah dan Purbakala which focussed on preservation efforts; and Pusat Penelitian Purbakala dan Peninggalan Nasional which focussed on archaeological research. In 1980, the institution was changed to Pusat Penelitian Arkeologi Nasional (National Archaeological Research Center) under the Ministry of Education and Culture. In 2000 the institution was transferred to Ministry of Culture and Tourism. In 2005 the institution name was changed to Pusat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Arkeologi Nasional (National Archaeological Research and Development Center). In 2012 it changed again to Pusat Arkeologi Nasional (National Archaeological Center) with authority transferred back from the Ministry of Tourism to the Ministry of Education and Culture. Today, several Indonesian public universities have archaeology study programmes, including Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, University of Indonesia in Jakarta, Udayana University in Bali, Hasanuddin University in Makassar, Haluoleo University in Kendari and Jambi University in Jambi.

He was the nephew of his namesake, Karl Gatermann, also an artist.  Life  Gatermann trained as a decorator while working for his father in Zerbst. He attended art school at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Dessau with Wilhelm Danz in 1926, and from 1927 studied at Bauhaus Dessau with Walter Gropius, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and Lyonel Feininger. In 1928 he received a journeyman's certificate and he passed his Master's examination in 1933. Paying for his studies required occasionally working in the painting class of the Berufsschule in Zerbst. From 1935 until the beginning of World War II, he studied in Munich at the Academy of Fine Arts. His teachers there were Angelo Jank, Max Doerner, Adolf Schinnerer, Max Mayrshofer, and Emil Preetorius. As a set designer, he worked at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich as well as at the opera houses in Magdeburg and Bernburg; he also worked at Bavaria Film in Munich, on the sets of feature film ' with Theo Lingen. After the war, Gatermann mainly painted landscape oil paintings from the Munich area. The Munich art publishing house Emil K√∂hn purchased many of his mountain paintings and reproduced them as art postcards. Gatermann declared himself as the first painter of the Munich parkland. His style approached late- impressionism during this period.  Selected works  * Wide landscape with grazing cows , oil / board, signed K.

From 1919 onward, the Elder did not include the \\"Munich\\" notation, since he had returned to L√ºbeck. The Younger, on the other hand, usually added \\"Munich\\" beneath his signature, since he lived and worked there. Additionally, from around 1950, the Younger usually signed in printed letters, which the Elder never did.

The Annedal Church is visible in the background. The site was originally planned to house the new Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and the municipality bought the land in 1896 for that purpose. The plans were however changed and the land was instead converted to a playground for the planned √Ñngg√•rden garden city.

A memorial stone with the text \\"Here on Karlsrof√§ltet, IFK G√∂teborg played their first football match in the year 1904\\" () has been raised on the site as commemoration. The field was renovated in 1906, ensuring correct playing dimensions and regulation goalposts. It was mainly used for training and lower league games despite this, due to the lack of changing rooms and a very uneven pitch. IFK G√∂teborg stopped using the venue for training in 1910, but returned a final time in 1923 to play the season premiere at Karlsrof√§ltet in front of a crowd of 4,000. All official activity was moved from the field in the 1950s due to major traffic rerouting nearby claiming part of the ground, and in 1960 the pitch size was reduced from the previous full-size to seven-a-side measurements, due to further traffic projects in the area.

Northern Water works with the Colorado-Big Thompson Project to transfer water from the Colorado Western Slope over the Continental Divide for agricultural, industrial, and municipal water supply in northeastern Colorado. The District's offices are in Berthoud, Colorado. Water supply infrastructure Northern Water manages numerous water infrastructure projects, including reservoirs, pipelines and tunnels, dams, hydroelectric plants, and feeder canals. For example, the Alva B. Adams Tunnel brings water from the Upper Colorado River basin across the mountains to the South Platte River watershed in northern Colorado. Also, Horsetooth Reservoir, west of Fort Collins is among the more well-known reservoirs Northern Water manages. Northern Integrated Supply Project The Northern Integrated Supply Project is a project managed by Northern Water which proposes to build two new reservoirs in Northern Colorado. The proposed Glade Reservoir will take and store water from the Cache la Poudre River, and the proposed Galeton Reservoir will pull water from the South Platte River. However, the project faces organized opposition. Municipal Subdistrict The Municipal Subdistrict, a subordinate organization of Northern Water, was formed on July 6, 1970. The subdistrict was set up to take advantage of some unallocated Colorado River water that could also be piped over the divide for the benefit of Northern Waters customers. The Windy Gap Project, as it came to be called, provided for the construction of a diversion dam near Granby in Grand County. Now the Windy Gap Reservoir is able to divert about 48,000 acre feet of water each year to users within Northern Water's service area.Municipal Subdistrict.

Country According to Norman Tindale, the Kutjal's tribal territories embraced roughly , around the Upper Staaten and middle Einasleigh rivers. Their northern frontier was in the vicinity of the Lynd River, while their southern boundary was set approximately at Lane Creek and north of Georgetown. Beliefs According to Frederic Urquhart, who was a commissioner leading a unit of the Australian native police in the Kutjal territory, the Kutjal believed that:- > 'unless strong preventive measures are taken, the spirits of departed > members of the tribe rise from their graves and continually haunt and > otherwise annoy those who are still in the flesh. Accordingly, elaborate > precautions are adopted to keep the unfortunate ghosts confined in the grave > which holds their mortal clay. The modus operandi is as follows > On the death of a member of the tribe, his or her head is cut off and the > trunk placed in a grave in the usual squatting position, and covered up. A > fire is then lighted on the top, in which the head is roasted; when it is > thoroughly charred it is broken up into little bits amongst the hot coals, > and the fire is then left to die gradually out. The theory is that the > spirit rising from the grave to follow the tribe misses its head, and goes > groping about to find it; but being bereft of its head, it is of course > blind, and therefore, not being able to see the fire, gets burnt. This > frightens it so terribly that it retires into the grave again with all > expedition, and never again presumes to attempt a renewal of social > intercourse with the human denizens of this world.

Description  Interior part of the park A view of the park from above This mediterranean garden was created thanks to the approval of the project by the town administration, led by doctor Massimo Ferrara, Lord Mayor from 1993 to 2001. In the sixties, they had planned the creation of some outdoor sports facilities in this area; at the time Mr. Ludovico Corrao (later Lord Mayor of Alcamo from 1960 to 1962) was the Regional Minister for Public Works under the government of Silvio Milazzo. He got to realize some works in Alcamo, among which the bronze bas-reliefs of Porta Palermo, commissioned to the sculptor Nicola Rubino, representing \\"The poet Cielo d'Alcamo at Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor‚Äôs court\\" and \\"Active life in Alcamo\\". The park, with an area of about 12,000 square metres, is like a charming garden with various kinds of plants and trees, typical of the flora of macchia mediterranea. As soon as you get in, on the right you can see the memorial tree, dedicated to the two carabiniers killed on 27 January 1977 in the Strage di Alcamo Marina‚Äô slaughter: Carmine Apuzzo and Salvatore Falcetta. On 18 November 2014 the town administration, led by doctor Sebastiano Bonventre, by public invitation, entrusted it to Associazione Laurus, whose President was dottor Gianni Gervasi at that time; its volunteers soon provided to clean it and do the maintenance of the green. Moreover, they realized a playground for children, a little petting zoo and an easy access for disabled people.  Activity  During the school year, they make cultural and gaming activities for children, and various educational workshops for the pupils of primary school. In August, since 2010, \\"Alcart - legalit√† e cultura\\" organizes some events with different events (exhibitions, seminars, music, theatre etc.). On April 2016, there was another event called ‚ÄúFesta di Primavera‚Äù (Spring Festival): its aim was to let children approach nature; besides taking part in lessons and games, they also saw the planting of some little plants of flowers given by Associazione Laurus itself. On September 2016, the same association organized the Giornata Nazionale dei Giochi della Gentilezza (the National Day of the Games of Kindness), for kids aged 6-14: the aim of this activity was to reinforce interpersonal skills, accepting and collaborating with other people, and motivating to the use of kind words, being inspired by stories. Finally, in December, they realized the third edition of the event Natale al Parco (Christmas at the Park), with choruses, exhibitions, parades, Christmas markets and the Living Crib.

It teaches Philosophy, Theology, Classical Philology, Canon Law and Religion Sciences with official validity in all the universities of the Catholic Church. Its name is taken from the Pope Damasus I. It is located in the center of Madrid, in Spain, next to the famous basilica of San Francisco el Grande and contiguous to the Conciliar Seminary of Madrid, where is the headquarters of the library and the Faculty of classical and Christian Letters. Under the motto \\"Veritatis Verbum communicantes\\", the University performs a task of training aspirants to the priesthood or other forms of consecrated life, although it is open to anyone who wants to deepen scientifically and rigorously in the Catholic faith. In addition, he actively collaborates in different educational programs of the Archdiocese of Madrid, such as the permanent formation of priests and the School of pastoral agents. History The San Damaso University has more than a century of history behind it. It originated in the Conciliar Seminary of Madrid. In 1990 it is approved by the Congregation for the Catholic Education the Center of Studies San Damaso. Thanks to the efforts of the then Archbishop of Madrid, Antonio Mar√≠a Rouco Varela, it grew considerably and achieved ever more prestige and institutional consolidation. Thus, in 1996 he was erected in the Faculty of Theology. In that year he already had the Institute of Religious Sciences and the San Justino Institute associated with it. But from that moment on, he began to take steps in order to expand their teaching offer. In 2000, the Statutes of the Institute of Religious Sciences were approved, in 2007 the Institute of Canon Law was founded and in 2008 the Faculty of Philosophy. In 2010, the San Justino Institute becomes the Faculty of Christian and classical literature. Finally, in 2011 the Institute of Canon Law also became a Faculty of Law. In this same year, the Holy See, through the Congregation for Catholic Education erects \\"San Damaso\\" on June 28 as Ecclesiastical University. Javier Prades Lopez was appointed delegate of the archbishop of Madrid, Antonio Maria Rouco Varela. On the 3rd of October of the same year he presided the first solemn inauguration as a university in the company of Zenon Grocholewski, cardinal prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education, who gave the inaugural lesson. On December 22, 2011, the theologian Javier Maria Prades Lopez was appointed first rector of the Ecclesiastical University San Damaso, position of which takes possession on January 27, 2012. In 2012 is erected the new institute superior of Religious Sciences with two sections: face-to-face and distance. It is the result of the integration of the remote SCCRR San Agustin to the ISCCRR San Damaso. This university center has had a number of distinguished personalities and students, including the renowned Spanish philosopher Xavier Zubiri, who began his studies in what was then only Madrid Seminary. He had also studied there, after his conversion, the philosopher Manuel Garcia Morente. Outstanding were the visits of then Cardinal Ratzinger, then Pope Benedict XVI, the famous theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar or who later became secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer. Recently, on the occasion of his tragic demise, Spanish public opinion has known for years that he was dean of the Faculty of Theology, Pablo Dominguez Prieto. In their classrooms have also taught Julian Carron, who later became president of the fraternity Communion and Liberation and the well-known philosopher Juli√°n Mar√≠as. It is worth noting the large library, which has many volumes, some of a certain value and antiquity; many of them saved by Jose Maria Garcia Lahiguera during the course of religious persecution during the Spanish Civil War. The library fulfills, besides the academic functions, a mission of offering of the Christian culture to the contemporary world. Its catalog is accessible by internet. It has an Office of Research and International Relations that allows its own students to study in various universities in Europe and students in Europe in the San Damaso thanks to the Erasmus Programme.

According to Netflix, the series was viewed by 48 million people, in its first four weeks. Critical response For the first season, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes collected 84 critic reviews and identified 60% of them as positive, with an average rating of 6.19/10. The website's critics consensus states, \\"Ratched is undeniably stylish, but salacious plot holes and cartoonish characterizations undermine its gorgeous production and committed performances.\\" Metacritic assigned the season a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a 5/5 stars review, Nicholas Barber from BBC.com wrote, \\"Ratched ratchets up everything, from the deeply colourful design to the Bernard Herrmann-like music to noir-ish soap-opera plotting that drips with sex and violence. But it isn't pure camp. Romansky's superb scripts keep tight control of the characters and their intertwining stories, and there are some chillingly accurate depictions of brutal 1940s psychiatric treatment. Ratched is also oddly big-hearted for such a gruesome series. The characters are a crowd of villains, with next to no one who could be classed as heroic, but they are all vulnerable, and most of them are motivated by love ‚Äì even if that love inspires them to hire a hitman to decapitate an old enemy.\\" The Independents Alexandra Pollard, who rated it 4/5, found the origin story to be \\"thoughtful and beguiling\\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a C‚àí and described the series' clothes as \\"nice, but they're dressing a corpse.\\" Reviewing the series for The Hollywood Reporter, Inkoo Kang wrote that, \\"The performances are across-the-board fantastic, but Nixon‚Äîplaying Mildred's love interest‚Äîexhibits such frailty, sensuality and decency that her turn ultimately ends up feeling like it belongs in a much better production.\\" TVLine wrote that the series \\"might be [Ryan Murphy's] emptiest effort yet\\", giving it a D.

It is endemic to the island of Samar, the Philippines. It is only known from its type locality, the Taft Forest Reserve in Taft, Eastern Samar. The specific name bayani is derived from the Tagalog word meaning \\"highly respected\\", \\"heroic\\", or \\"hero\\". The name honors , in recognition of his \\"numerous contributions to Philippine herpetology and ‚Ä¶ lifelong commitment to the study of biodiversity in the SW Pacific.\\" Accordingly, common name Walter's limestone forest frog has been proposed for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is robust, and the head is broad. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers are slender, long, and bear greatly expanded terminal discs, as do the toes. The toes have some basal webbing. The dorsum and head are mottled light green, dark green, and black and bear low, salmon-colored tubercles. There is a distinct interorbital bar. The limbs have alternating dark brown and green transverse bars on their dorsal surfaces. The flanks have series of dark brown to black blotches and spots. The iris is mottled golden-brown and dark brown, with a bright gold ciliary ring surrounding the pupil. Habitat and conservation Platymantis bayani is known from primary- and secondary growth forest on karst substrate at above sea level. Both males and females were observed perched on top of limestone rocks within large rock formations in the forest; they were well camouflaged against this background. This species has never been observed perching in trees or shrubs, as most closely related species do. Breeding is probably direct, with eggs presumably deposited in limestone crevices and small caves. Platymantis bayani was quite common at the type locality. It is possible that it has a broader distribution, but its range is probably restricted by the presence of relatively undisturbed limestone formations with forest cover. It is primarily threatened by limestone quarrying and mining for the cement industry. Forest clearing for shifting agriculture, wood collection for firewood and charcoal production, and commercial illegal logging constitute additional threats.

The specific name citrinospilus is derived from the Greek words kitrinos (=\\"yellow\\") and pilos (=\\"spot\\" or \\"stain\\"), in reference to the distinctive bright yellow flank areolations characteristic of this species. Description Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length; females are unknown. The overall appearance is slender. The snout is moderate, bluntly round. The tympanum is distinct. The eyes protrude moderately beyond dorsal surface of the head in lateral aspect. The fingers and toes have widely expanded terminal disks but no webbing. Skin of dorsal surfaces is finely granular. The dorsum has dark brick reddish-brown ground coloration with extensive to nearly absent suffusion of light green pigment on upper surfaces of head, trunk and limbs. Juxtaposition with white dermal tubercles on dorsal surfaces gives an overall pale green lichenatious color results. A thin light cream to white vertebral stripe is present. The labial and postrictal region is bright immaculate white to yellow. The flanks and concealed posterior surfaces of the thighs have bold, bright yellow areolations. The ventrum is pale pink, with dark red throat. The male advertisement call is slow series of dull, medium-frequency notes, which to the human ear resemble the sound produced by striking together two pieces of wood.

It was released in May 2017 for the PlayStation 4, with PlayStation VR support available. A version for Microsoft Windows was released December 2018. The game takes its name and inspiration from the fictitious 1981 arcade game Polybius.  Gameplay  Llamasoft's Polybius is a fast-paced 3D shooting game with elements of racing games. The game's play was designed to minimize virtual reality sickness by the use of continuous forward motion with limited abrupt changes, and no interruptions to gameplay other than controlled breaks at the end of each level; however, the game does include intense visuals. Although designed as a VR game, Polybius is fully playable in 2D on a standard PlayStation 4, and also includes support for 3D television output.  Development and release  In 2016, Llamasoft announced a game called Polybius for the PlayStation 4 with support for the PlayStation VR. Polybius was added on the PlayStation store on Tuesday May 9, 2017. In early marketing, co-author Jeff Minter claimed to have been permitted to play the original Polybius arcade machine in a warehouse in Basingstoke. He later more realistically stated that the game was inspired by the urban legend, but does not attempt to reproduce its alleged gameplay. He said it was instead based on his interest in the ability of video games to induce the psychological state of flow (also called \\"being in the zone\\") and his own observations of positive psychological effects as a result of playing VR games, most notably the unreleased VR version of TxK. Minter also cited influence from multiple other classic games including Space Harrier, After Burner, the 1983 vector game Star Wars, S.T.U.N. Runner, Zarch and quite possibly NanoTek Warrior. . On July 13, 2017, industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails released a music video for the song \\"Less Than\\", featuring a woman playing Polybius. Llamasoft later described the version of the game used in the video, a custom build running on the PC with user configurable effect sequencing. As of November 7, 2018, the game page on the Steam store is live, with a Q4 release date, playable in VR or non-VR. On December 21st, 2018, the game released for PC.  Reception  Polybius received positive reviews from game critics. On review aggregator Metacritic, it holds an average score of 84 out of 100, based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Metro called it \\"one of the definitive action games of the current generation\\". Eurogamer awarded it a Recommended trophy, labeling it as \\"magical\\" as well as one of Llamasoft's best works. The website also ranked it 44th on their list of the \\"Top 50 Games of 2017\\".

These are the arms of de Quincy, adopted in lieu of his paternal arms (Vairy or and gules) by William Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Groby (1272-1325).Cokayne, G. E.; Gibbs, Vicary & Doubleday, H. A., eds. (1926). The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, extant, extinct or dormant (Eardley of Spalding to Goojerat). 5 (2nd ed.). London, p.343, note (c) He was the son and heir of Sir William de Ferrers (1240-1287) of Groby, the younger son of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (by his second wife Margaret de Quincy, daughter and heiress of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester (c.1195-1264)) who founded the line of Baron Ferrers of Groby, having been given Groby Castle by his mother Margaret de Quincy William Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby (1372‚Äì1445) was an English baron in the late middle ages. He was an important figure in Leicestershire society and took part in most of the royal commissions that were held there. He was also active at a national level and earlier in his career he took part in some of the crises in the reigns of both King Richard II and Henry IV. However, he supported the Lancastrian regime under Henry V and acted as a councillor to that King's baby son when the latter inherited the throne at the age of six months. Ferrers was married three times, twice to daughters of the peerage. Because his eldest son died before him, the Ferrers barony descended to his granddaughter's husband. Thus, when William Ferrers died, the Ferrers line, which had begun in England with the Norman conquest, after which they were first granted lands in Leicestershire came to an end. Early years and inheritance Ferrers was born at Hoo, Bedfordshire, and baptised there the same day, 25 April 1372. He was the only son and heir of Henry Ferrers, 4th Baron Ferrers of Groby and his wife, Jean, daughter of Sir Thomas Hoo of Luton Hoo. The bulk of the Ferrers' family landholding was in Leicestershire. In May 1394, Ferrers turned 21- the age of majority- and, on paying homage to King Richard II, received livery of his inheritance, the King's escheator taking his fealty in Warwickshire and Leicestershire. By July he had received his mother's dower lands, including the knight's fees and advowsons, and the following year he had received livery of manors in Suffolk. Career One of Ferrers' earliest acts of royal service was to join the King on his 1394-5 expedition to Ireland, where a by-now \\"resurgent\\" Irish nobility was threatening royal rule. Two years later, Ferrers was summoned to parliament for the first time, and would attend four more parliaments between then and January 1444. On at least two of those occasions he was appointed a trier of petitions. (n.(f) Although he had shown loyalty to the King in his early years, says the Ferrers family's most recent biographer, William's \\"political affiliations were flexible.\\" Ferrers took part in some of the momentous events of the last years of Richard II's turbulent reign. In September 1397 he was among those who swore, upon the shrine of Edward the Confessor in the Palace of Westminster, to uphold statutes. Two years later‚Äî after the usurpation of Henry IV ‚Äîhe was a member of the House of Lords that gave its assent to the secret imprisonment of the by-then deposed King Richard. In 1401 he was a member of the lords who condemned two members of the Holland family as traitors, John, Duke of Exeter and his nephew Thomas, Duke of Surrey, who had been executed the previous year for their part in the failed 'Epiphany Rising' of the previous year. Five years later, Ferrers also sealed the exemplifications of the Acts which settled the royal succession, in July and December 1406. Ferrers also joined the royal council in 1422, after the death of King Henry V in France, as the new King‚Äî also Henry ‚Äîwas a six- month-old baby. Ferrers' appointment, says Ralph Griffiths, \\"provided an injection of youth into discussions hitherto conducted by a rather elderly group\\"; in any case, it made the regency council \\"more fully and representatively attended.\\" However, Ferrers spent as much time as a local administrator and looking after his estates as he did involved in national politics. He was a justice of the peace and a commissioner of array in Leicestershire for most of his life. However, local politics was not always more peaceful than government. In 1426, for example, Sir William Bermingham, from Coventry, with a group of men, attacked Ferrers' house in Smethwick and killed two of Ferrers' servants in doing so.  Family  left Ferrers married three times. His first marriage was arranged whilst he was still a minor. At the age of sixteen, a few months after the death of his father, the right to dictate his marriage was conferred upon Roger, Lord Clifford. As was the custom of the time, Clifford arranged for Ferrers to marry Clifford's daughter Philippa, and this not only connected Ferrers to the Clifford noble house but also (through Clifford's marriage to Maud Beauchamp, daughter of Thomas) to the Earl of Warwick. Ferrers' second marriage was to a Margaret Montagu (died before October 1416), daughter of John, Earl of Salisbury, and his third was to Elizabeth Standisshe, daughter of Robert Standisshe of Lancashire. This last marriage had taken place by the end of October 1416, and had not received a royal licence; Ferrers was her third marriage also.  Death and will  Elizabeth predeceased him, dying in either January or February 1441; he outlived her by slightly over four years, dying on 18 May 1445 at his manor of Woodham Ferrers, Essex. His will had been written the day before. Ferrers left a bequest that his body be buried in Ulverscroft Priory, Leicestershire. Ferrers had had to take part in the Income tax of 1436, at which his estate was valued at ¬£666. Ferrers' heir, Thomas, was worth ¬£100 on top of this. However, although Thomas was his heir, he was only William's second son. Ferrers' eldest son and original heir, Henry, had died in 1425. As a result, the family caput honoris of Groby and its barony passed not to Thomas but to William Ferrers' granddaughter‚Äîand Henry's heiress‚ÄîElizabeth (1419‚Äì1483). She eventually married Sir Edward Grey in 1426 and thus conveyed the Barony of Groby away from the Ferrers family; this, historian K. B. McFarlane believed, was the point at which the Ferrers family line was finally extinguished.

The operation began early that morning in Villa Purificaci√≥n, where four Mexican Air Force and Federal Police (PF) helicopters spotted a CJNG convoy protecting El Mencho. As one of the helicopters flew over the convoy, the CJNG members shot it down using rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. Nine law enforcement officers died as a result of the attack, and multiple others were wounded. This was the first incident in the Mexican Drug War in which organized crime groups shot down an aircraft. As the government extended its crackdown on the CJNG, it issued its highest security alert level and coordinated municipal, state, and federal security forces. The CJNG responded to the offensive by hijacking 39 buses, trucks, and cars throughout western Mexico, setting them on fire, and using them to block roads and highways in multiple locations. They also burned several gas stations, banks, and businesses. Most of the attacks took place in Guadalajara, Jalisco's capital and the second-largest urban area in Mexico. According to the government, the scale and level of coordination by the CJNG in this attack had not been displayed by other crime groups in Mexico. The attacks garnered international headlines and reactions from the highest levels of the Mexican government, including President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, who promised the dismantling of the CJNG's leadership structure. Mexico's National Security Commission placed significant attention on El Mencho, and publicly announced that they were making his arrest a priority. Over the course of a year, violence and homicides increased in Jalisco. However, as the government shifted its attention in 2016 to re-apprehend Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, once Mexico's most-wanted drug lord, the CJNG readjusted its strategy and toned down its violent methods. Background and possible motives According to the Mexican government, the attacks were one of the most brazen moves by organized crime against Mexican security forces in the ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006‚Äìpresent). They were also unique in that a relatively new criminal group in Mexico like the CJNG was willing to confront the government head on. Though organized crime groups in Mexico had used rocket launchers against security forces in the past, it was the first time that one had shot down a military aircraft. This showed the Mexican government that the CJNG had the manpower and operational capacity to respond to government crackdowns. The CJNG's influence in Mexico's criminal landscape had grown significantly since 2009‚Äì2010. The group was formed as a splinter organization of the Milenio and Sinaloa Cartels after several of their leaders were arrested or killed. Their international drug trafficking operations, specifically for heroin and methamphetamine, increased the group's financial power and capacity. Their market share growth in Mexican territory was also correlated with the arrest and deaths of the leaders of rival criminal groups like the Knights Templar Cartel and Los Zetas. The CJNG's stronghold, Jalisco, gave the group a strategic advantage since Jalisco ranks high in industrial output and gross domestic product (GDP). Logo with the Spanish acronym of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), the criminal group responsible for the attacks The attack was covered in international media, prompting reactions at the highest levels of the Mexican government. President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto told the public that day through his Twitter account that the CJNG would be dismantled by the government. Mexico's security commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido Garc√≠a (es) told reporters in an interview after the helicopter attack that the government would spend significant resources to capture Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the top leader of the CJNG. The government's urgency to confront the CJNG had intensified the month before, when the CJNG ambushed and killed 15 policemen in Jalisco. The same day the attacks occurred, the government inaugurated Operation Jalisco, a military-led campaign to combat organized crime groups in Jalisco and capture their leaders. The new security operation was made up of the Army, the PF, the Attorney General's Office (PGR), and the Center for Research and National Security (CISEN), Mexico's national intelligence agency. The main target of the operation was the CJNG. Around 10,000 new troops and 300 armored vehicles were dispatched to the state for Operation Jalisco on 10 and 11 May. The helicopter attack and the roadblocks were a response by the CJNG to the attempted capture of El Mencho. The government stated that the violence in Jalisco was a reaction to Operation Jalisco. According to sources from the PF, prior to the helicopter attack, El Mencho was spotted in Tonaya, Jalisco, which prompted a law enforcement offensive to apprehend him. His gunmen defended him from the PF and he was able to escape. The helicopter that was shot down was equipped with parachutes that were intended to be used by the officers on board. They were planning to jump off and continue their operation on foot with the goal of capturing El Mencho. Unconfirmed federal and state sources said that someone within law enforcement notified the CJNG of the surprise operation. They said the government confirmed this through wiretapping. The sources stated that the CJNG had detected unusual law enforcement activity in the area where El Mencho was hiding, but they did not have clear information on the operative against him until it was leaked by an insider. When the roadblocks occurred, rumors circulated that El Mencho was arrested by security forces. Law enforcement confirmed that they were close to capturing El Mencho, but did not confirm him among the detainees arrested that day. The government considers El Mencho the main suspect and mastermind of the 1 May attacks. Helicopter attack Cougar EC725 of the Brazilian Air Force, a similar model to the one in the attack Before dawn at around 6:30 a.m. on 1 May 2015, an armed convoy from the CJNG made their way from Casimiro Castillo to Villa Purificaci√≥n via dirt roads. The vehicles drove with their headlights off to avoid detection by the Mexican Air Force and the Federal Police (PF), who were doing air surveillance of the area in four helicopters. One of the vehicles was equipped with rocket- propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. As the helicopters flew over the convoy, the CJNG units opened fire. One of the helicopters, a Cougar EC725 carrying eighteen passengers, was hit on its tail with a Russian-made RPG-27 rocket launcher. Once hit, the helicopter spun several times in the air as it tried to maneuver its way back into trajectory. It then fell at a distance from where it was struck and exploded. The assailants fired six missiles at the helicopter and hit it twice; the gunmen tried shooting down another helicopter, but missed. The CJNG gunmen then attempted to execute any remaining living passengers. However, military reinforcements in the air prevented the gunmen from getting close to the collision scene and forced them to retreat. Nine passengers were killed as a result of the airstrike: eight from the Mexican Army and one from the PF. Some of the soldiers killed were part of the Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales, the elite special forces unit of the Army. The other passengers were taken to the Regional Military Hospitals in Guadalajara to receive medical attention. Their health conditions were not made public. Logo of the Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales, the elite Army branch involved in the attack The day of the attack, the Mexican government confirmed that three military men were killed and three Army soldiers were missing, while the remaining twelve passengers (ten from the Army and two from the PF) were recorded as wounded. During the first 24 hours, their search was contained in a radius, but investigators widened the search area when the missing men were not found. On 4 May, the government confirmed that it had located the victims of the attack. They had to identify their corpses by conducting DNA tests as the bodies has been torn into pieces from the helicopter's explosion. This increased the death toll to six. On 6 May, the seventh passenger from the Army died of cardiac arrest as a result of the wounds he suffered from the helicopter's fall. The following day, one of the PF passengers died from his wounds. On 10 May, the ninth and final victim of the attack, a soldier from the Army, died at a hospital. Authorities confirmed that four other passengers had been discharged from the hospital after treatment. Five more remained in the hospital receiving medical attention. Following the helicopter attack, the PF and military personnel cordoned the area and conducted a thorough search of the premises. They initially discovered four abandoned vehicles that they suspected were owned by the perpetrators. In the vehicles, investigators discovered military uniforms with the insignia \\"CJNG Special Forces High Command\\" with five embedded stars. No immediate arrests were made. The Army seized 15 assault rifles, 6 handguns, 2 RPG launchers, 2 LAW rocket launchers, 10 rocket launcher missiles, 5 hand grenades, 92 chargers for multiple weapons, and 3,800 cartridges of different weapon calibers. Possession of several of the above weapons was illegal under Mexican law. Authorities also seized radio communication equipment, several bullet-proof vests, and nine vehicles. One of the vehicles was equipped with tools to carry a RPG launcher. Investigators handed these items over to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency. At the helicopter collision scene, several Army soldiers made a cross with wires and tied it to a tree close to where their comrades died. The cross had the logo of the special forces unit. The smoke from the helicopter's crash lasted a few hours, and several of the helicopter's pieces scattered as far as from each other. About 24 hours after the crash, the Army reached the crash site and cordoned off the area to allow investigators to collect forensic evidence. Soldiers established checkpoints around Villa Purificaci√≥n and searched vehicles leaving and entering the town. Other Army units patrolled the streets of the town and nearby highways in search of the suspects. Besides Villa Purificaci√≥n, which had the largest military presence, there were also significant numbers of soldiers in Autl√°n and Uni√≥n de Tula.  Roadblocks and arsons  Location of Guadalajara and its surrounding metropolitan area within Jalisco As the government deployed throughout Jalisco to crack down on the CJNG's offensive, violence erupted in 25 of its municipalities and in four surrounding states: Colima, Nayarit, Michoac√°n, and Guanajuato. In these areas, the CJNG hijacked 39 vehicles and established roadblocks using cars, trucks, and transportation buses. Thirty-six of the 39 hijacked vehicles were set on fire by the CJNG. According to eyewitnesses, the CJNG obtained the vehicles by pointing their weapons at drivers on the road and forcing them to a complete stop. They would then hijack the vehicles, spray them with gasoline on the inside, and set them on fire. Setting up roadblocks is a common tactic of the CJNG and other organized crime groups in Mexico; the CJNG had used roadblocks on a large scale at least three times since 2012 in an apparent attempt to create confusion after strategic arrests. Their purpose is to halt the mobility of security forces on the road and prevent them from making arrests. However, the attacks of 1 May surpassed the previous attacks in terms of magnitude and coordination. According to reports from the National Security Commission (CNS) (es), approximately 250 CJNG members participated in the attacks in an organized way; an unprecedented level of coordination. In addition to burning vehicles and setting up numerous blockades, the CJNG also burned several banks, gas stations, and businesses across western Mexico. Thousands of people were left stranded across major highways and streets since they were unable to get to their destinations because of the attacks. The roads in Guadalajara and the surrounding metropolitan area were the most affected by the attacks and roadblocks. Civilians posted videos and photos of the burning vehicles on social media, and government officials used this platform as well to update civilians and warn them of the risk situations. The government asked civilians to avoid rumors on social media and only rely on official information. The severity of the attacks forced the Government of Jalisco to activate its \\"red code\\" alert, a designation used to warn citizens of risk situations across the state. This is the highest level in the alert system and is used when the state is considered to be under great danger. With the activation of the red alert, Governor Jorge Arist√≥teles Sandoval D√≠az confirmed that municipal and state forces were coordinating efforts with the federal government. He told the public that he had informed President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto of the attacks early in the day, and that the President had assigned Secretary of Interior Miguel √Ångel Osorio Chong to communicate on his behalf. By the end of the day, Jalisco and the surrounding states were restored to normality, but Jalisco authorities recommended that its citizens remain indoors if possible. The red alert lasted until 3 May, and the government issued a preventative security phase following the alert's cancellation. The government clarified that the coordinated efforts of all three levels of government continued uninterrupted despite the cancellation. Governor Sandoval D√≠az denied that the additional federal forces in Jalisco meant that the state was being militarized. The government confirmed that in addition to the passengers killed in Villa Purificaci√≥n, eight suspected CJNG members and a state police officer from Autl√°n were killed in other clashes stemming from the 1 May attacks. Several state and federal police officers were reported wounded in confrontations in Jalisco and other states. The day of the attacks, the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara issued multiple security warnings through its Facebook page and on its website. It reported that there were several blockades across Jalisco and Colima, and that there were vehicles, gas stations, banks, and other buildings set on fire during the attacks. It warned its employees in Jalisco about the attacks and blockades, and asked them to remain at home until the situation was resolved by law enforcement. The warning also extended to American tourists planning to visit Jalisco, imploring them to avoid visiting the area and to observe public announcements by the Mexican government. The consulate was closed for International Workers' Day (1 May), but was open on Monday, 4 May. The warning concluded by encouraging U.S. citizens traveling or living in Mexico to consult the alerts and warnings page at the website of the U.S. Department of State. The Canadian Embassy also warned Canadians to stay home and limit their outdoor activities. Reactions Government Logo with the Mexican Air Force, the military branch that suffered the attack At 1 p.m. on 1 May, President Pe√±a Nieto made an official announcement on social media regarding the helicopter attack. He stated that he lamented the death of the soldiers killed \\"in the line of duty,\\" and thanked the courage of the federal forces in combating organized crime. The government confirmed that they were planning a ceremony to honor the servicemen killed in the attack. Osorio Chong also expressed his condolences through social media. In addition, several high- ranking officials in the Army and Air Force expressed their condolences to the families. In the following days, Pe√±a Nieto met with the families of the helicopter attack victims in private. On 4 May, the government held a ceremony at Campo Marte in Mexico City, where Pe√±a Nieto headed a flag ceremony with the Military Service volunteers. In his speech, he thanked the Mexican Armed Forces for \\"risking their lives\\" for working to maintain peace in Mexico, and stated that the attacks from organized crime only made the government's efforts stronger. He clarified that the government had arrested or killed in action most of Mexico's most-wanted criminals. Two days later, the President held another ceremony at the Campo Militar 1-F along with the special forces general Miguel √Ångel Aguirre Lara. Pe√±a Nieto offered his condolences to the family members and gave them a Mexican flag. In an interview at the World Economic Forum in the Riviera Maya on 7 May, Sandoval D√≠az stated that the attacks of 1 May were \\"acts of vandalism\\", not signs of narcoterrorism. He stated that the word \\"narcoterrorism\\" was not defined under Mexican law and thereby did not carry legal weight. He argued that the detainees arrested that day were under the influence of drugs and were paid between MXN$500 and MXN$1,000 to commit the attacks. When asked whether there was a leak of information from the police's side to the CJNG, he stated that he was not aware of any illegal intelligence sharing between law enforcement and organized crime. A reporter asked him whether the helicopter attack counted as vandalism too, and he clarified that that attack was different from the roadblocks and arson reported elsewhere in Jalisco. He also stated that it was not the government's intention to minimize the incidents of 1 May by not categorizing them as terrorist acts. Sandoval D√≠az argued that the CJNG placed roadblocks to create chaos among the civil population and to slow law enforcement's mobility. He explained that the roadblocks forced security forces to divide their units to restore order and clear up the streets, allowing the CJNG members to escape. He attributed the root cause of the violence to the balkanization of organized crime groups in Jalisco and the nearby regions. His remarks, however, drew criticism after the media considered that the government was being dismissive of the severity of the attacks. Jalisco Governor Jorge Arist√≥teles Sandoval D√≠az in a press conference On 8 May, suspected members of the CJNG put up a banner near a Los Ni√±os H√©roes monument in Autl√°n threatening federal forces stationed there. They gave an ultimatum saying that the forces had one month to leave the town before they would take action. \\"We will kill every soldier we see in the street,\\" the banner read. The government took the threat seriously and reacted by tightening security in Autl√°n, the coastal region of Jalisco, and in the southern part of the state. The banner was supposedly signed by four suspected CJNG local leaders known by the aliases \\"El 24,\\" \\"El 7,\\" \\"Japo,\\" and \\"Vaquero.\\" These banners are commonly used by organized crime groups as propaganda. On 10 May, federal forces revisited Villa Purificaci√≥n, where the attack occurred, in several helicopters. They were accompanied by additional troops on the ground. On 11 May, Governor Sandoval D√≠az held a meeting at El Grullo with several mayors from Regi√≥n Costa Sur and Regi√≥n Sierra de Amula (es), two regions in Jalisco. Among those present were Jalisco's secretary general Roberto L√≥pez Lara and Army General Miguel Gustavo Gonz√°lez Cruz, the head of Operation Jalisco. Outside of the building where they met, the police dispatched snipers on nearby roofs while the military mounted a checkpoint at the town's entrance. In the meeting, Sand√≥val D√≠az told the mayors that the Jalisco State Police was taking over the municipal police forces' duties under the rationale that the local police was not equipped to deal with organized crime infiltration. On 8 June, the Army issued a posthumous promotion to eight of its members who were killed in the helicopter attack. Among them were two Army infantry captains, an Air Force pilot, an Army infantry lieutenant, an Air Force sub-lieutenant, two-second-degree Army infantry sergeants, and another Air Force member. The promotion also included another military-police member killed in an unrelated incident in Tamaulipas. This action was signed and approved by Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, the head of the Secretariat of National Defense. The victims were granted this promotion because the government considered that their \\"exceptionally meritorious\\" service prior to their death showed that they were loyal to their duty. The purpose of the promotion was to provide moral and economical support to the victim's families, as well as to highlight the commitment of the troops. On 23 December, Pe√±a Nieto awarded Iv√°n Morales Corrales, one of the PF survivors, a medal for his heroism. Morales suffered burns on 70% of his body and nearly died from damage to his internal and external organs. The ceremony took place at the National Auditorium in Mexico City with over 10,000 PF members in attendance, in addition to the victim's family members. Peaceful protests Statue of La Minerva in Guadalajara, where one of the protests took place On 9 May, around 1,000 civilians in Guadalajara dressed in white and conducted a silent march. The march started in the Providencia neighborhood in western Guadalajara and ended at La Minerva (es), one of the city's main monuments. It was organized online under the hashtag #CaminataPorLaPazGDL. According to the march organizers, the purpose of the movement was to bring peace awareness in light of the incidents that occurred on 1 May. They also asked citizens to self-reflect on their behavior in society and analyze what they have done to promote change. The organizers stated that they were not part of any belief system, foundation, political group, or organization. Several celebrities from Guadalajara promoted the march through social media. The march included people from various age groups; entire families were also recorded in attendance. There were also several sports, business, and religious groups present. They were guarded by the Guadalajara Municipal Police, the Jalisco State Police, and the Civil Protection and Fire Brigade corporations. Once civilians reached La Minerva, they adorned it with flowers and candles. There were about 1,500 civilians by the end of the march. Several of the activists present spoke to the media and explained that they or their family members were victims of violence in Jalisco in the past. Others explained that they were marching because they were tired of the violent incidents in their home state. The movement ended after those present sang the Mexican National Anthem and played a video recording of a child who advocated honesty as a means for peace. \\"Peace starts in each and everyone one of us,\\" was the final quote of the recording. On 14 May, multiple civil organizations got together in Mexico City and announced their plan to organize another silent march for Jalisco in the city on 31 May. This announcement was made two days after the PGR confirmed that the CJNG operated in Mexico City. The groups responsible for organizing the event issued a declaration for why they were joining the cause. The declaration said that they repudiated the violence caused by the CJNG in Jalisco, and acknowledged that the attacks they carried out against the Mexican government on 1 May were serious and dangerous. They also expressed their solidarity with the families of the passengers killed in the helicopter attack, and stated their support of the Mexican Armed Forces in their combat against organized crime to restore peace in Jalisco and the rest of Mexico. Aside from supporting the government's cause, the organizers also asked federal and states authorities to fight impunity and corruption. On the day of the march, 300 civilians gathered at the Angel of Independence statue and started their march through Paseo de la Reforma and headed towards Campo Marte, where they ended their march at the newly inaugurated Memorial to Victims of Violence with a moment of silence for the passengers killed.  Continued violence  On 19 May 2015, rumors spread that the Army was involved in a shootout with suspected organized crime members in Villa Purificaci√≥n. The death toll that circulated was eight civilians dead. The state government clarified that those killed were involved in the attacks of 1 May. According to accounts from several families from Villa Purificaci√≥n, however, some of their relatives went missing after the 1 May attacks. They suspected that the eight civilians reported as \\"killed\\" that day were possibly related to this incident. According to their testimonies, the Army was involved in several shootouts with suspected organized crime members in their town after 1 May, resulting in dozens of locals killed. The families claimed that the Army took the corpses of the civilians killed‚Äîclose to 40‚Äîand piled them in the wilderness for two weeks. One of the family members said she tried to go to the area where the bodies were reportedly located, but several soldiers prevented her from going any further and threatened to arrest her. The families said that their relatives were not involved with organized crime and had nothing to do with the 1 May attacks. One of the family members told investigators that civilians in Villa Purificaci√≥n were scared to reach out to the government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on 1 May in Villa Purificaci√≥n. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Pe√±a Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One of the family members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could get close to the bodies to see if any of them were her missing relative, the soldier told her that the relatives were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot. She claimed that the soldier told her that they killed those people because they were responsible for the deaths of their comrades. Villa Purificaci√≥n, Jalisco (in green), where the helicopter attack took place This case was first reviewed by the PGR in Jalisco, and was then sent to the SEIDO in Mexico City as the agency responsible for investigating this case. The lawyer for the families criticized the government's decision to move the case to the SEIDO because it \\"victimized\\" them. He also stated that the families were poor and did not have the resources to go to Mexico City. The lawyer stated that the families went to the forensic medical services installations in Guadalajara to see several bodies the government had sent from Villa Purificaci√≥n. Although they gave DNA samples at the PGR offices in Jalisco to see if any of the corpses at the morgue were relatives, investigators told them that they lacked legal jurisdiction and that the DNA results could only be given to them in Mexico City. The lawyer stated that there were verbal accounts that civilians in Villa Purificaci√≥n were tortured and extrajudicially killed by security forces. He also questioned the government's delay in bringing the bodies to Guadalajara, since this gave investigators an excuse to not investigate the highly decomposed bodies. He also stated that it would be impossible for investigators to prove that those killed used any weapons on 1 May or were part of the CJNG. On 21 May, the families attempted to put forward a writ of amparo and accused the government of violating their rights by putting up unnecessary barriers by forcing them to visit Mexico City to see the results of the DNA samples. On 24 May, the families pushed their case to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) to help them retrieve the DNA samples from the PGR in Jalisco. The CNDH told the lawyer that the families no longer had to go to Mexico City for the DNA samples and that they could do the procedures in Jalisco. The government was able to confirm the identity of three of the eight civilians killed. The government stated that their DNA samples matched those of the family members, but clarified that these people were killed in clashes with security forces on 1 May and not on 19 May. The families of Villa Purificaci√≥n contested the government's final decision, and stated that between May and 19 May, dozens of people were killed in the town. They claimed that the Army safeguarded the morgues to prevent civilians from seeing the bodies and identifying them. On 22 May, the families of the missing people returned to Villa Purificaci√≥n. According to the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences, a branch of the Government of Jalisco, violence between organized crime groups and security forces increased in Jalisco after 1 May. From that date to 25 April 2016, Jalisco registered 1,195 homicides. The year before the attacks, from 1 May 2014, to 30 April 2015, only 1,094 homicides were registered. This meant that violence in Jalisco increased nine percent in the year after the 1 May attacks. According to the state government, the increase in violence was a result of the arrests carried out by security forces against the criminal groups' leadership structures, as organized crime groups are destabilized and have to restructure ‚Äì often violently ‚Äì after their leaders are taken down. In 2016 alone, Jalisco recorded 1,152 homicides, compared to 1,017 in 2015. Of the 2016 homicides, 786 of them were done with firearms: 223 of them were recorded in Guadalajara, 123 in Zapopan, 94 in Tlajomulco de Z√∫√±iga, 62 in Tlaquepaque, and the remaining figures in other municipalities. In addition, around 5,000 car thefts were reported in Jalisco that year. Investigation and crackdowns Following the attacks of 1 May, the government arrested 19 people suspected of participating in the attacks. One of the suspects was injured after engaging in a gunfight with an officer from the Jalisco State Police, and was under arrest at the hospital. He was shot in the head after reportedly hijacking and setting a vehicle on fire. The officer who confronted him was injured in the thorax but was reported as stable. A few days later, the state government confirmed that the number of detainees was down to 11, which included one minor. The Jalisco Attorney General, Luis Carlos N√°jera Guti√©rrez de Velasco, confirmed that the eight other detainees were released after they were found not guilty. Of the 11 detainees, 6 were accused of terrorism and organized crime charges for participating in the car hijackings and arson. Four additional suspects were charged with the theft of oil for use in arson. On 6 May, the PGR formally charged five suspects for illegal possession of exclusively military firearms, attempted murder, and involvement in organized crime. The next day, a judge ordered the release of three suspects after concluding that they were arrested illegally and not given a right to counsel during their confessions. On 22 July, another suspect was arrested in Tlaquepaque for his suspected participation in the 1 May attacks. Uni√≥n de Tula, Jalisco (in green), where the disarmament took place On 15 May, the Government of Jalisco disarmed the municipal police forces of Villa Purificaci√≥n and Uni√≥n de Tula. Villa Purificaci√≥n had 19 police officers and one police chief, while Uni√≥n de Tula had 11 police officers and one police chief. All of them were ordered to appear in court. Legally, the state government has the power to disarm municipal forces because it has the right to grant and revoke licenses for bearing arms. Governor Sandoval explained that this non-violent procedure took three hours and was done in light of the measures proposed through Operation Jalisco and the attacks of 1 May. He also explained that the state government conducted a large-scale investigation and discovered that organized crime groups had infiltrated the police. Around 150 state officials were disarmed. Jalisco's security commissioner Francisco Alejandro Solorio Ar√©chiga informed the press that they retrieved 36 rifles (20 from Villa Purificaci√≥n and 16 from Uni√≥n de Tula), 46 handguns (20 from Villa Purificaci√≥n and 26 from Uni√≥n de Tula), and nine vehicles (four from Villa Purificaci√≥n and five from Uni√≥n de Tula). In a communiqu√©, the state government explained that public security duties would fall under state and federal authorities. On 18 November, federal authorities arrested Iv√°n Cazar√≠n Molina (alias \\"El Tanque\\") in Tlajomulco de Z√∫√±iga for his alleged involvement in the helicopter attack. At the building where he was arrested, authorities confiscated four assault rifles, three handguns, a package of cocaine, four vehicles, and radio communication equipment. According to PF chief Enrique Francisco Galindo Ceballos (es), El Tanque was a high-ranking leader of the CJNG and reported directly to El Mencho as the group's second-in-command following the arrest of El Mencho's son Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez (alias \\"El Menchito\\"). The PF also suspected that his center of operations was in Guadalajara, where he used money laundering proceeds to further his criminal activities. They believed he was also responsible for drug trafficking, extorting businesses, leading oil theft rings, and homicides in Jalisco and Veracruz. Prior to his arrest, the PF carried out several covert operations over six months and eventually found their way to El Tanque's inner circle, where they discovered that he frequented a location that the CJNG used as one of its centers of operations and as a recreation spot. The police highlighted that no shots were fired in the operation, partly because El Tanque and his three accomplices were drinking alcohol and were not prepared to defend themselves when the police raided the building. On 2 August 2018, the Mexican government arrested six people for their alleged participation in the helicopter attack and in the ambush in Ocotl√°n. The men were arrested at a ranch in Jalisco that was thought to be owned by the CJNG and used as a distribution hub. Renato Salas Heredia, the CNS commissioner, stated that investigators believed these men were part of the inner circle of the CJNG's leadership. Salas explained that these arrests were carried out as part of a PF effort known as Operation Escudo Tit√°n. That same day, the PF also arrested eight CJNG members in Quintana Roo. Security forces considered both Jalisco and Quintana Roo as major hubs for the CJNG and hot spots of the Mexican Drug War. Multiple vehicles and ammunition were confiscated at both crime scenes.  Aftermath  After the 1 May attacks, the Mexican government placed significant attention on El Mencho. In other violent events in the Mexican Drug War, the government has swiftly responded against sensational acts of violence, often leading to the arrest or death of drug kingpins. Pe√±a Nieto said after the attacks that the CJNG was going to be treated in similar fashion. CNS chief Rubido Garc√≠a also told reporters that the government was concentrating efforts to capture El Mencho. The reaction from the government was intensive because the attacks were unprecedented in the Mexican Drug War; before the attacks, the government had not seen that aggressive of a response from organized crime. According to investigators, the CJNG was able to carry out the attacks because they had territorial knowledge and control, and because they were able to manage resources, logistics, and intelligence information in their favor. In addition, the CJNG was suspected of having well-trained foot soldiers, likely with former police and military training, who employed paramilitary tactics during the 1 May attacks. The attention shifted from El Mencho on 15 July 2016, when the suspected Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, once on Mexico's most-wanted list, escaped from prison a second time. This event embarrassed the Mexican government, which reallocated resources to apprehend El Chapo. This was important for the CJNG because it allowed El Mencho to re-evaluate the group's violent methods against security forces. Over time, ambushes and attacks against law enforcement declined, and the CJNG began to focus on fighting rival criminal groups and incursions into their turf.

Wivenhoe Park by John Constable, 1816 Early life Rebow was born on 28 November 1731, the son of Isaac Lemyng Rebow, MP and his wife Mary Martin, daughter of Captain Matthew Martin, MP. He was educated at Eton College from 1745 to 1748 and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 8 December 1748. He was awarded BA in 1753. He succeeded his father in 1735, inheriting Wivenhoe Park near Colchester, and in 1759 commissioned Thomas Reynolds to build a house there. Career In the 1754 general election Rebow stood for Parliament at Colchester and was defeated by a narrow margin. However the poll was conducted in a scandalous manner and Rebow was seated as Member of Parliament on petition in 1755. The main local issue was the loss of the Borough's charter and the campaign to regain it. The displaced member Charles Gray was chastened by the experience but in the 1761 general election they agreed to cooperate and were returned unopposed. They managed to obtain a new charter in 1763 in the same form as the previous one and in it Rebow was named as Recorder of Colchester. He held the post until his death. Rebow and Gray oversaw almost twenty years of compromise and in a contest at Colchester in the 1768 general election they saw off a third candidate, Rebow topping the poll. Family life Rebow married his cousin Mary Martin, daughter of Thomas Martin of Alresford Hall, Essex at St Margaret's Westminster on 27 August 1772. He had previously been in a relationship with another cousin Sophia Christianna de Hopman with whom he had had an illegitimate child but he continued to support her after his marriage. Later life Rebow and Gray were both returned unopposed in the 1774 general election but by July 1780 Rebow was in a very poor state of health and it was uncertain whether he would stand for parliament again. Nevertheless, he was returned again for Colchester in 1780 after a contest. Though active locally, Rebow was inactive in Parliament and the King wrote in 1781 with regard to some changes made at Colchester that ‚ÄùRebow was so bad an attender and so doubtful in his conduct that the change seems advantageous.‚Äù Rebow died on 3 October 1781 and was buried at St Mary's, Colchester, leaving 3 daughters. Wivenhoe Park passed to his daughter Mary Hester, who married General Francis Slater, who then took the surname Rebow.

Nevertheless, Donald Lang is convicted and sent to a mental institution. After several years of appeals, Myers finally manages to have his client released making an eloquent appeal to the state Supreme Court that a deaf mute is entitled to the same rights as one not impaired.

His Albert Medal was translated to the George Cross in 1971. Ellis was born in Surbiton in Surrey in 1890, the son of Henry Charles Ellis and May (n√©e Bennett). He was educated at Salisbury Cathedral School and at the Montpelier School at Paignton in Devon. The family lived at Home Cottage in Roundwell in Bearsted. Ellis had one brother, Charles Harold. His great- grandfather, Charles Ellis was the Mayor of Maidstone in 1860, and his grandfather Charles junior was also Mayor of Maidstone three times: in 1864, 1872 and 1878. When World War I broke out in 1914 Ellis was working at the Union of London and Smith‚Äôs Bank in Maidstone. He enlisted with the Public Schools Corps in September 1914 as a Private and arrived in France with them in November 1915, serving in the trenches for six months opposite the Hohenzollern Redoubt. He returned to England and trained as a bomb instructor at Oxford following which he was given a commission before being gazetted to the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), going with his battalion to India and then to Mesopotamia. According to The London Gazette of 18 July 1919: 'On 21 August 1918, Lieutenant Ellis was with a party at Shahraban under instruction in the firing of rifle grenades. A volley was fired, but one of the grenades, owing to a defective cartridge, did not leave the rifle, but fell back into the barrel with the fuse burning. The firer lost his head and dropped the rifle and grenade in the trench, but Lieutenant Ellis, who was separated from the man by four other men in a narrow trench, at once forced his way past them and seized the rifle. Failing to extract the grenade, he dropped the rifle and placed his steel helmet over the grenade, which at once exploded, severely injuring him. There can be no doubt that his prompt and courageous action greatly minimised the force of the explosion and saved several men from death or injury'.The medals of Bernard George Ellis in the National Army Museum Ellis survived his injuries and was invalided back to India, where he served as Captain of the Guard to Lord Willingdon, Governor of Bombay. Despite 350 pieces of the exploded grenade being in his body, 77 of them in his right arm, Ellis remained a keen sportsman. In 1971 he was among the surviving recipients of the Albert Medal and the Edward Medal who accepted the offer to exchange their awards for the George Cross.

Early life  Born to an English mother and a Welsh father, Bowen spent his earliest years on his family's farm, Pentrebach in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School, and left with a higher school certificate. In 1940 he started studying history at University College, Aberystwyth. From there he was awarded a Welsh Church Scholarship to read history at Oxford University (College unknown). In 1941 he suffered a bad fall while training with the Officer Training Corps in Aberystwyth, which triggered the rheumatic condition ankylosing spondylitis. He was bed-ridden initially while he was treated in Cardiff Hospital in 1941, then in the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in 1942. He was consequently unable to take up his place at Oxford and this experience gave him the idea of a national charity to assist young rheumatism sufferers with their educational ambitions. Bowen continued to struggle with his own education while also garnering support for his idea of a charity. He began a course in architecture in 1943 which he had to abandon because of his health. In 1946 he graduated from the University of London with a BA in Economics, Constitutional Law and History.  British Rheumatism and Arthritis Association (arthritis care)  Bowen conceived the idea of a national charity to assist young arthritis and rheumatism sufferers with their education in 1942. He spent most of the time he was in hospital lobbying MPs, medics, the press and various members of the aristocracy, which led to the formation of the British Rheumatism and Arthritis Association in 1947. In 1949 Bowen took on the formal role of Executive Vice-President, and in 1976 became the charity's honorary legal adviser. In 2017 Arthritis Care was the largest UK charity delivering services to arthritis sufferers, with 170 branches, over 10,000 members and ¬£5.5 million of assets.Charity Commission Website. \\"Arthritis Care Charity Information\\"  Other philanthropic activities  From 1943 to 1945 Bowen campaigned for Further Education for disabled ex-service men and women. He initiated a number of smaller-scale organisations, including the \\"BRA Holiday Hotel scheme\\" (1956), the BRA Home South-West (1973), the National Disabled Youth Centre Trust (1975), the Torbay Arthritis Clinic (1970) and the Torbay Sheltered Workshop (1972). He was the chairman of the Torbay and District Disablement Advisory Committee (Dept. of Employment) 1969 - 1975. He was also a trustee of the Pinder Children's Trust and the Open University Medical Society (dates unknown).  Personal life  Bowen was married to Helen Patricia Cope, an occupational therapist, on 29 August 1953. They had one daughter Philippa, and one son Jonathan born in 1962. He died on 31 January 1980.

The eleventh generation of the iPhone, it was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017. The iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and \\"bezel-less\\" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a \\"chin\\", unlike many Android phones. It was the first iPhone to use an OLED screen. The home button's fingerprint sensor was replaced with a new type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan the user's face to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes. The iPhone X received positive reviews. Its display and build quality were universally praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. However, the sensor housing \\"notch\\" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method were polarizing for critics and consumers. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience in their apps and games. Face ID facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct eyes on the screen, though that option can be disabled within the system preferences. Along with the iPhone 6s, its Plus variant, and the first-generation iPhone SE, the iPhone X was discontinued on September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest ever tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone. On November 22, 2018, Apple reportedly resumed production of the iPhone X due to weak sales of its successors. The iPhone X remains discontinued, but as of February 2019, Apple started selling refurbished models starting at $769. The price was subsequently lowered to $599 in November 2019, and $549 in October 2020. History The technology behind the iPhone X was in development for five years, as far back as 2012. Rumors of a drastic iPhone redesign began circulating around the time of iPhone 7 announcement in the third quarter of 2016, and intensified when a HomePod firmware leak in July 2017 suggested that Apple would shortly release a phone with a nearly bezel-less design, lack of a physical home button, facial recognition, and other new features. A near-final development version of the iOS 11 operating system was also leaked in September 2017, confirming the new design and features. On August 31, 2017, Apple invited journalists to a September 12 press event, the first public event held at the Steve Jobs Theater on the company's new Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California. The iPhone X was unveiled during that keynote. Its US$999 starting price is the most expensive iPhone launch price. The price is even higher in international markets due to currency fluctuations, import fees and sales taxes. An unlocked version of the phone was made available for purchase in the United States on December 5, 2017. In April 2018, the Federal Communications Commission divulged images of an unreleased gold-colored iPhone X model. As opposed to the space gray and silver color options that the iPhone X ships with, it was divulged that there were initial plans to release a gold option for the device. However, it was put on hold due to production issues. Apple released a revised B model for the iPhone X that fixed NFC issues for users in Japan, China, and the United States. Specifications Hardware =Display= The iPhone X has a 5.85 inch (marketed as 5.8 inch) OLED color-accurate screen that supports DCI-P3 wide color gamut, sRGB, and high dynamic range, and has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1. The Super Retina display has the True Tone technology found on the iPad Pro, which uses ambient light sensors to adapt the display's white balance to the surrounding ambient light. Although the iPhone X does not feature the same \\"ProMotion\\" technology used in the displays of the second-generation iPad Pro, where the display delivers a refresh rate of 120 Hz, it does sample touch input at 120 Hz. OLED screen technology has a known negative trend of \\"burn-in\\" effects, in which particular elements consistently on the screen for long periods of time leave a faint trace even after new images appear. Apple acknowledged that its OLED screens were not excluded from this issue, writing in a support document that \\"This is also expected behavior\\". Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing, told Tom's Guide that the OLED panels Apple used in the iPhone X had been engineered to avoid the \\"oversaturation\\" of colors that using OLED panels typically results in, having made color adjustments and \\"subpixel\\"-level refinements for crisp lines and round corners. For out-of- warranty servicing for damages not relating to manufacturing defects, screen repairs of iPhone X cost US$279, while other damage repairs cost US$549. =Color options= The iPhone X has two color options; silver and space gray. The sides of the phone are composed of surgical-grade stainless steel to improve durability, and the front and back are made of glass. The design is intended to be IP67 water and dust resistant. =Chipsets= The iPhone X contains Apple's A11 Bionic system-on-chip, also used in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which is a six-core processor with two cores optimized for performance (25% faster than the A10 Fusion processor), along with four cores optimized for efficiency (70% faster than the previous generation). It also features the first Apple-designed graphics processing unit and a Neural Engine, which powers an artificial intelligence accelerator. =Biometric authentication= Face ID replaces the Touch ID authentication system. The facial recognition sensor consists of two parts: a \\"Romeo\\" module that projects more than 30,000 infrared dots onto the user's face, and a \\"Juliet\\" module that reads the pattern. The pattern is sent to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip to confirm a match with the phone owner's face. By default, the system will not work with eyes closed, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access but this requirement can be disabled in settings. =Cameras= The iPhone X has two cameras on the rear. One is a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/1.8 aperture, with support for face detection, high dynamic range and optical image stabilization. It is capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30 or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second. A secondary, telephoto lens features 2√ó optical zoom and 10√ó digital zoom with an aperture of f/2.4 and optical image stabilization. A Portrait Mode is capable of producing photos with specific depth-of-field and lighting effects. It also has a quad-LED True Tone flash with 2√ó better light uniformity. Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412√ó1920) can be captured during video recording. On the front of the phone, a 7-megapixel TrueDepth camera has an f/2.2 aperture, and features face detection and HDR. It can capture 1080p video at 30 frames per second, 720p video at 240 frames per second, and exclusively allows for the use of Animoji; animated emojis placed on top of the user's face that intelligently react to the user's facial expressions. =Wireless charging= iPhone X also supports Qi-standard wireless charging. In tests conducted by MacRumors, the iPhone X's charging speed varies significantly depending on what types of cables, powerbanks, adapters, or wireless chargers are used. Software Due to its different screen layout, iOS developers are required to update their apps to make full use of the additional screen real estate. Such changes include rounded corners, sensor \\"notch\\" at the top of the screen, and an indicator area at the bottom for accessing the home screen. Apple published a \\"Human Interface Guidelines\\" document to explain areas of focus, and discouraged developers from attempting to mask or call special attention to any of the new changes. Additionally, text within the app needs to be configured to properly reference Face ID rather than Touch ID where the authentication technology is used on iPhone X. In anticipation of the release of the phone, most major apps were quickly updated to support the new changes brought by iPhone X, though the required changes did cause delayed app updates for some major apps. The traditional home button, found on all previous devices in the iPhone lineup, has been removed entirely, replaced by touch- based gestures. To wake up the device, users can tap the display or use the side button; to access the home screen, users must swipe up from the bottom of the display; and to access the multitasking window, users must swipe up similarly to the method of accessing the home screen, but stop while the finger is in the middle of the screen, causing an app carousel to appear. Reception General reviews iPhone X's rear camera received an overall rating of 97 from DxOMark, a camera testing company, short of the highest score of 99, awarded to Samsung's Galaxy S9+ smartphone. Google's Pixel 2 received a rating of 98. Consumer Reports, a non-profit, independent organization aiming to write impartial reviews of consumer products, ranked iPhone X below iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, as well as below Samsung's Galaxy S8, S8+ and Note 8, due to less durability and shorter battery life, although it praised the X's camera as \\"the highest-rated smartphone camera\\" it had ever tested. Nilay Patel of The Verge praised the display, calling it \\"polished and tight and clean\\" and \\"bright and colorful\\". He criticized the repeated lack of a headphone jack, the device's fragility despite Apple's claims of durability, and the sensor notch, calling it \\"ugly\\". Patel highlighted the fact that apps required updates to fit the new screen, writing that not all popular apps had received updates by the time of the review, resulting in some apps with \\"huge black borders\\" resembling iPhone 8. He especially criticized the positioning of the sensor notch while holding the phone in landscape mode, causing the notch to go \\"from being a somewhat forgettable element in the top status bar to a giant interruption on the side of the screen\\". The cameras were given positive feedback for maintaining detail in low-light. Patel particularly praised Animoji, calling it \\"probably the single best feature on the iPhone X\\", writing that \\"they just work, and they work incredibly well\\". Finally, he wrote that Face ID was the whole foundation of iPhone X, and stated that it \\"generally works great\\", though acknowledging the occasional misstep, in which users must \\"actively move the phone closer to your face to compensate\\". He specifically criticized the limited range of Face ID, with authentication only working when holding the phone 25‚Äì50 centimeters away from the face. Chris Velazco of Engadget also praised the display, writing that, in his experience, the sensor \\"notch\\" goes from being \\"weird at first\\" to not being noticeable due to action in videos usually happening in the center. The build quality was given particular acclaim, being called \\"a beautifully made device\\" with a construction that \\"seamlessly\\" connects the front and back glass with the stainless-steel frame. Velazco noted that the new gesture-based interaction takes time getting used to, particularly the Control Center being moved from the bottom to the top right of the display. The camera, processor performance, and battery life were also given positive thoughts. The cost of repairing an iPhone is also very large compared to its predecessors. If the iPhone X is damaged by user damage (not a manufacturing defect), screen repairs cost USD$279, and other repairs like replacing iPhone X batteries are more expensive. In a heavily negative review, Dennis Green of Business Insider significantly criticized the impossible one-handed use of iPhone X, writing that the new gestures to use the phone, such as swiping from the top down to access notifications and the Control Center, did not work when using the phone with only one hand due to not being able to reach the top. His review sparked outrage among Twitter users, many of whom used condescending tones, which Green reasoned as \\"I don't know whether the anger was directed toward me out of loyalty to Apple or to justify their own choice to spend $1,000 on a phone. It was obvious that much of the criticism came from people who had never used the phone\\". Macworlds Roman Loyola praised the Face ID authentication system, writing that the setup process was \\"easy\\" and that its system integration was \\"more seamless\\" than the Touch ID fingerprint authentication of the past. That said, Loyola did note the \\"half-second\\" slower unlocking time than Touch ID as well as needing to look directly at the screen, making it impossible to unlock with the phone next to the user on a desk. Face ID security and privacy concerns Face ID has raised concerns regarding the possibility of law enforcement accessing an individual's phone by pointing the device at the user's face. United States Senator Al Franken asked Apple to provide more information on the security and privacy of Face ID a day after the announcement, with Apple responding by highlighting the recent publication of a security white paper and knowledge base detailing answers. Inconsistent results have been shown when testing Face ID on identical twins, with some tests showing the system managing to separate the two, while other tests have failed. However, despite Apple's promise of increased security of Face ID compared to the Touch ID fingerprint authentication system, there have been multiple media reports indicating otherwise. The Verge noted that courts in the United States have granted different Fifth Amendment rights in the United States Constitution to biometric unlocking systems as opposed to keycodes. Keycodes are considered \\"testimonial\\" evidence based on the contents of users' thoughts, whereas fingerprints are considered physical evidence, with some suspects having been ordered to unlock their phones via fingerprint. Many attempts to break through Face ID with sophisticated masks have been attempted, though most have failed. A week after iPhone X was released, Vietnamese security firm Bkav announced in a blog post that it had successfully created a $150 mask that tricked Face ID, though WIRED noted that Bkav's technique was more of a \\"proof-of-concept\\" rather than active exploitation risk, with the technique requiring a detailed measurement or digital scan of the iPhone owner's face, putting the real risk of danger only to targets of espionage and world leaders. Additionally, Reuters reported in early November 2017 that Apple would share certain facial data on users with third-party app developers for more precise selfie filters and for fictional game characters to mirror real-world user facial expressions. Although developers are required to seek customer permission, are not allowed to sell the data to others nor create profiles on users nor use the data for advertising, and are limited to a more \\"rough map\\" rather than full capabilities, they still get access to over 50 kinds of facial expressions. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Democracy and Technology raised privacy questions about Apple's enforcement of the privacy restrictions connected to third-party access, with Apple maintaining that its App Store review processes were effective safeguards. The \\"rough map\\" of facial data third-parties can access is also not enough to unlock the device, according to Reuters. However, the overall idea of letting developers access sensitive facial information was still not satisfactorily handled, according to Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU, with Stanley telling Reuters that \\"the privacy issues around of the use of very sophisticated facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone have been overblown. ... The real privacy issues have to do with the access by third-party developers\\". Sensor housing controversy Much of the debate about the iPhone X has revolved around the design of the sensor housing, dubbed \\"notch\\" by the media, at the top of the display. The Outline described it as \\"a visually disgusting element\\", and The Verge posted a report focusing on public criticism and people mocking Apple's \\"odd design choice\\", but not every reviewer was equally negative in their opinions. Third-party iOS developers interviewed by Ars Technica said that, despite the work of restructuring design elements in their apps, the notch did not cause any problems, with some even arguing that the notch was a good push to simplify their designs. Just two weeks after iPhone X's release, Apple approved a \\"notch remover\\" app through the App Store, that places black bars across the top of the home screen to make the notch visually disappear. The approval was done despite the company's user interface guidelines discouraging developers from specifically masking the design. iPhone X was not the first device with a notch‚Äìboth the Essential Phone and Sharp Aquos S2 were announced before it and had a display notch, albeit much smaller, but the iPhone X arguably popularized it. Issues Early activation issues In November 2017, early adopters of the new phone reported that they were experiencing activation issues on certain cellular carriers, most notably AT&T.; AT&T; announced within hours that the issue had been fixed on their end, and a spokesperson for the Verizon carrier told the media none of its customers were affected despite some reports of problems. Cold weather issues In November 2017, iPhone X users reported on Reddit that the device's screen would become unresponsive after experiencing rapid temperature drops. Apple released the iOS 11.1.2 update on November 16, 2017, fixing the issue. Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly reported in March 2018 that over 1,000 users experienced problems using camera flash in cold weather, with the problem still persisting as of iOS 11.3 beta 1. Cellular modem differences Apple has been engaged in a legal battle with Qualcomm over allegedly anti-competitive practices and has been dual-sourcing cellular modem chips to reduce reliance on the semiconductor manufacturer. Starting with iPhone 7 in 2016, Apple has used about half Qualcomm modem chips and half Intel. Professional measurement tests performed by wireless signal testing firm Cellular Insights indicated that, as in the previous-gen iPhone 7, Qualcomm's chips outperform Intel's in LTE download speeds, up to 67% faster in very weak signal conditions, resulting in some sources recommending the purchase of an unlocked iPhone X or one bought through cellular carrier Verizon, in order to get the models featuring the faster Qualcomm modem. Additionally, CNET reported in September 2017 that the new iPhone models, including X, 8 and 8 Plus, do not have the ability to connect to the next- generation of wireless LTE data connection, despite 10 new Android devices, including flagships from main smartphone competitor Samsung, all having the capability to do so. While Apple's new smartphones have support for \\"LTE Advanced\\", with a theoretical peak speed of 500 megabits per second, the Android models have the ability to connect to \\"Gigabit LTE\\", allowing theoretical speeds up to 1 gigabit per second, doubling Apple's speed. NFC problems After releasing the iPhone X in Japan and China, customers experienced issues related to the phone's NFC while trying to access public transit smart card readers. In April 2018, Apple released a revision to the iPhone X, that included a vastly improved NFC chip. This solved the problem of NFC reader errors in most cases. Previously around 1 out of 3 NFC attempts would fail after initial reports. This issue also affected users in America. Display Module Replacement Program Apple has determined an issue with certain iPhone X devices where the display wouldn't respond to the user's touch, due to a component that might fail on the display module. Apple stated that they will repair the affected devices, free of charge.

His recordings span country, rhythm and blues, soul, and doo wop. He was an early influence on Elvis Presley. Jimmy and Elvis Jimmy's main claim to fame is as an influence to the young Elvis and that he was the mystery singer on a demo disk played to Elvis by Sam Phillips. An enduring myth from the fifties is that the young unknown Elvis was daunted by the performance on record of an (unknown) singer. The story is that Elvis as an undiscovered 18 year old was introduced to a demo record of \\"Without You\\" by Sam Phillips on 24 Jun 1954. (Elvis had already visited Sun before that to record two sessions for personal use, and Marion Keisker had taken note of his potential). Sam had a stack of demos that had been sent into him, one was a disk of an unknown ballad \\"Without You\\", by an unknown singer with guitar. The song began: \\"Always at twilight I wish on a star, I ask the lord \\"to keep you wherever you are...\\" Sam had been impressed by it, but was unable to ascertain the name of the singer; nevertheless he toyed with releasing it as a single. Marion, (Sam's business associate) intervened with the idea to get Elvis to sing it as a debut record. Despite a spirited attempt at recording it Elvis felt he could not better the performance on the demo, and went on to work on \\"That's All Right\\", released in July 1954. The Sweeney demo remained privately in Marion's hands, its existence became an urban myth. The singer was not identified, till heard by Christopher Kennedy in early 2017, his suspicions were confirmed by Jimmy's daughter Eugenia, amongst others. The demo disc label identifies it as \\"Without You\\", \\"Audiodisc 3324\\", recorded at 78 rpm. The writer of the song has never been identified. Earlier to these events in January 1954, Elvis had in the second of two (self paid) private sessions cut a second acetate at Sun Records of \\"I'll Never Stand In Your Way\\" and \\"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\\". The latter a Fred Rose, Jimmy Wakely song. That song and the Sweeney demo have no similarity. Later in 1960 Jimmy Sweeney made an original recording in 1960 of \\"She Wears My Ring\\", a F. Bryant, B. Bryant adaptation of an old Mexican song \\"La Golondrina\\". This particular record had been Jimmy's most successful reaching number 5 on the Canadian Billboard, and in July 1962 number 24 on the American chart. Coincidentally Elvis was to cover it in 1973, on the Good Times album on RCA Records issued in 1974. It was a long time favourite of his, he had also (again coincidentally) made a home recording of it in November 1960 at 565 Perugia Way in Los Angeles, officially released on \\"Follow That Dream Records\\" label, In a Private Moment album. Roy Orbison recorded it for Monument Records in 1964. Life and career Early life Named after his father, who was born in Nashville; he was of West Indian descent. The second child of thirteen. A gifted American football player as a boy, he was a self-taught guitarist. He was born, raised, and based in Nashville, Tennessee all of his life. In 1943 he was drafted as Private into the US Army, at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, and was eventually honourably discharged. He married his wife Elsie in Jan 1941, and made ends meet as a carpenter. Solo career He recorded under various names; Jimmy Sweeney, Jimmy Bell and Jimmy Destry. He was the lead singer of \\"The Five Bars\\", who later changed their name to \\"The Varieteers\\". On the 8 Jul 1948 the Varieteers appeared as guests on the \\"Appointment With Music\\" (an NBC radio show originating from WSM, Nashville). The Varieteers, sang \\"All Dressed Up With A Broken Heart\\"... The host was Snooky Lanson, with Dorohy Dillard & Beasley Smith and his orchestra. In Oct 53, the Varieteers were at Ciro's in Hollywood. They performed in the intermissions between sets of Xavier Cugat and Abbe Lane. He travelled throughout the U.S. and Canada promoting his recordings gathering a legion of fans. However great success was to elude him. For a time he worked in Western Canada for C.P.Rail \\"She Wears My Ring\\" charted at #5 on CHUM, Toronto, in May 1961. Then, at the height of it all in 1962, aged 40, he opted out and returned home to Nashville; for a state government job. A period of inactivity followed, before he started again to write, penning songs for Columbia. Marty Robbins in particular recorded his songs. Most of his recordings were with the Hickory label. Associated labels were: *Bullet Records a \\"country and western\\" label owned by Jim Bulleit and located in Nashville, from 1946. Another artist on the Bullet label was B.B. King. *Buckley label, Louis Buckley's tiny Buckley label, Louis operated Buckley's Records (shop) in Nashville. *Chic Records of Thomasville, Georgia.

Mittank was vacationing at the Golden Sands resort, where he was involved in a fight, and was subsequently unable to fly home with his friends for health reasons. Mittank was witnessed acting strangely while alone in Bulgaria, and days later disappeared into the forest around Varna Airport for reasons unknown.  Mysterious behaviour and disappearance  On June 30, 2014, 28-year-old Lars Mittank traveled to the seaside resort of Golden Sands, Bulgaria on a vacation with a group of friends. On July 6, 2014, Mittank got into a fight with four other men after a disagreement over football: Mittank, a fan of the football club Werder Bremen, had differences with fans of Bayern Munich. The fight resulted in Mittank suffering a ruptured ear drum. At the end of his trip, a doctor advised Lars not to fly due to his injury, and prescribed the antibiotic Cefuroxime (500 mg). That doctor later referred him to a hospital. Mittank's friends wanted to stay with him, but he insisted he was fine on his own. Mittank stayed in Bulgaria without his friends, and checked into the Hotel Color Varna. However, a day after his friends left, Mittank began to act oddly, and his erratic behavior was recorded by the hotel's closed-circuit television security cameras. He spent only one night in the hotel, during which he appeared paranoid and frightened. While at the hotel, Mittank called his mother. In a whisper, he stated that four men were coming to kill him, and that she should cancel his credit cards. Mittank was last seen at Varna Airport, the airport that serves Golden Sands in the nearby city of Varna. He was consulting with the airport doctor when they were interrupted by a man who was a part of a construction crew. He then fled the building. He was captured by airport security cameras running away. Once outside the airport, he was seen climbing a fence, running into a meadow, and disappearing into an adjacent field of sunflowers near Bulgarian national highway A2. He has not been seen since.

During World War I, Rorty served as a stretcher bearer on the Argonne front, an experience that led him to become a \\"militant pacifist.\\" Rorty worked as a journalist and poet for more than sixty years. He considered himself \\"the last of the muckrakers,\\" as a combatant against social injustice in America. During World War I, Rorty moved to San Francisco to continue his career in advertising and to write experimental poetry. In 1925, Rorty moved to New York City, where he was a founding editor (with Michael Gold, Joseph Freeman, Hugo Gellert, John Sloan, and others) of the New Masses, a Communist literary magazine, which launched the following year. However, Rorty left that next year when fellow editors rejected his publication of Robinson Jeffers's poem \\"Apology for Bad Dreams.\\" In 1927, Rorty was one of many arrested during protests against the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. To earn money, he also worked as an editor, journalist, advertising copy writer, and consultant for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In 1932, he supported and then quit the campaign to support William Z. Foster (CPUSA) for U.S. president. Personal life and death Around 1919, Rorty married Maria Ward Lambin; they were divorced in 1928. The same year, he married writer Winifred Rauschenbush (daughter of Christian socialist Walter Rauschenbusch); they had one son, philosopher Richard Rorty. He suffered from depression. Rorty died at age 82 on February 26, 1973, in Sarasota, Florida. Works In the mid-1950s, Rorty co-authored with Moshe Decter a book attacking McCarthyism called McCarthy and the Communists, supported by the American Committee for Cultural Freedom.

He has been credited with writing 21 films and producing eight films. Hemberg is best known for writing many screenplays for the director Schamyl Bauman including Witches' Night (1937) starring G√∂sta Ekman, P√• Solsidan for Gustaf Molander, starring Ingrid Bergman, and The Girls' Alfred (1935) for Edvin Adolphson, starring Sture Lagerwall. He also wrote the screenplay for the Danish film Idag Begynder Livet for Lau Lauritzen Jr. and Alice O'Fredericks. Furthermore, Hemberg produced several films for Gustaf Molander, including Paresiennes, and His English Wife, as well as Bara en danserska by Olof Molander.  Career  Oscar Hemberg commenced his journalistic career in 1897, covering the 'Sj√∂bom murders' for two Swedish evening newspapers. He then began working as a volunteer at Sk√•ne Tidningen, which was dissolved the following year. Hemberg began his studies in Lund, but after a couple of years he dropped out and in 1901 once again ventured into journalism, this time for Malm√∂tidningen, as its police correspondent. During this time period he first started to appear in 'Dagens Nyheter', one of the largest Swedish newspapers. A few years on Hemberg became Dagens Nyheter's Malm√∂ correspondent. He eventually moved to the newspapers head office in Stockholm, as deputy editor. He is recognised, together with Anton Karlgren, to have radically modernised Dagens Nyheter's layout, and format. In 1909 he was integral to the launching of a new front page format which consisted of large images and sensational headlines, instead of advertisements. Furthermore, Hemberg was one of the first in Swedish press to realise the newsworthiness of sports, and organised sports tournaments under the newspaper's banner. He also added business and finance news, a Sunday paper, and expanded the special interest section for female readers. Hemberg was deeply inspired by British press, as well as the Danish paper 'Politiken'. Ellen Rydelius described Oscar Hemberg as \\"a mix between a snake charmer and a slave driver\\". Though Hemberg has authored theatre pieces during his time in Malm√∂, in 1916, he began focusing completely on writing film scripts. In total he authored 21 films, and produced eight films. Furthermore, he authored several plays including: \\"H√§r ska valsas\\" put up on Folkteatern in 1911, and \\"K√∂r fram till stora trappan\\" put up at Oscarsteatern in 1911. Hemberg also wrote \\"schlager\\" songs for Sigurd Wall√©n and Ernst Rolf, as well as couplets for Hansy Petra. In 1920‚Äì21 he served as the head of acquisitions for Svensk Filmindustri (SF), 1922‚Äì26 head of SF's theatres in Stockholm, 1926‚Äì27 the CEO of Filmab Isepa, and in 1928 executive producer for Deutsche Filmunion in Berlin. Oscar Hemberg notably wrote the film script for \\"P√• Solsidan\\" starring Ingrid Bergman, together with G√∂sta Stevens and Helge Krog. He also produced \\"The Ingmar Inheritance\\" in 1925 starring Conrad Veidt, directed by Gustaf Molander, which was an adaptation of Selma Lagerl√∂f's 'Jermusalem' novels. Hemberg worked frequently with Gustaf Molander and his brother Olof Molander, producing the films Parisiennes in 1928, F√∂rseglade l√§ppar and His English Wife in 1927, and Bara en danserska and Till √∂sterland in 1926. Hemberg notably wrote \\"The Girls' Alfred\\" in 1935, directed by Edvin Adolphson, starring Sture Lagerwall, and in 1940 \\"Stora Famnen\\", starring Sigurd Wallen.  Personal life  Olof Oscar Hemberg was born on 26 July 1881 in √ñstraby to the farmer Anders, and his wife Anna, and died on 14 May 1944 in Stockholm. Hemberg married Clara Laurentia Antonsson on 31 March 1904 in Malm√∂. His second wife was Emmy Hildur Elisabeth Holgersson, whom he married on 20 December 1904 in Stockholm.

It was elevated to a species in 2010, after previously being considered a subspecies of Geoffroy's tailless bat (A. geoffroyi). The females are larger than the males. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1844 by Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob von Tschudi. Tschudi initially placed it in the genus Glossophaga and the subgenus Choeronycteris, with a scientific name of Glossophaga (Choeronycteris) peruana. Beginning in 1878 at latest, it was published as synonymous with Geoffroy's tailless bat. In 2010, however, researchers concluded that A. peruana was morphologically distinct enough to be considered a full species. Its species name \\"peruana\\" means \\"Peruvian.\\" Description Several characters were used to differentiate A. peruana from Geoffroy's tailless bat. A. peruana has a larger skull; its zygomatic arches are incomplete; its uropatagium is smaller; and its fur is darker. Biology and ecology It is a nectarivorous species of bat. Species of flowers that it visits includes Siphocampylus giganteus, Bomarea multiflora, Leonotis nepetifolia, and Lamourouxia virgata. It could be an important pollen disperser in its ecosystem, as large amounts of pollen have been detected on individuals. Range and habitat It is found in several countries in South America, including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is found at mid- to high-elevation regions of the Andes.

He wrote Tre Canti di Leopardi in 1965 as a setting of three poems in Italian from the collection Canti by Giacomo Leopardi. He wrote the work for baritone and orchestra. The songs take about 14 minutes to perform. # ' (The Infinite) # ' (To Himself) # ' (To the Moon) From the expansive collection, Killmayer chose three poems from different periods. For the first song, he selected the early ' (The Infinite, 1819), which begins \\" (It was always dear to me, this solitary hill,). He marked his setting \\"Moderato, tranquillo\\". For the second song, he selected the later ' (To Himself, 1833), which has been described as a \\"suicidal assessment\\", written in concise lines of sometimes only one to three words per line. Beginning (Now you will rest forever), it talks about the death of the ultimate illusion. For the third song, he selected another early poem, ' (To the Moon, 1819). The beginning, \\" (O lovely moon, now I am reminded), has been described as an address to a light both ideal (\\"graziosa luna\\") and beloved (\\"mia diletta luna\\").

It is endemic to the Philippines and known with certainty only from the island of Mindoro, although it might also occur on the nearby Semirara Island. Even though this species was formally described only in 2010, Edward Harrison Taylor had already in 1920s recognized that it is distinct from Leptobrachium hasseltii, the name used for Philippine Leptobrachium at the time. Common name Mindoro litter frog has been coined for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is stocky. The head is wider than the body. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is obliquely ovoid and weakly distinct. The fingers and the toes have rounded, slightly to moderately expanded tips and no webbing. The dorsum is brown or gray, with variable markings. In some individuals, these markings consist of several large, darker, irregular blotches and semicircular spots with black borders, while in others, they are limited to the posterior portions of the head or the interorbital region. The darker dorsal coloration fades on the flanks. In most individuals, the venter is uniform dark gray with minute white spots on the warts. Some individuals, however, have white or cream ventral coloration, with distinctive dark gray marbling. Most individuals have dark transverse bars on dorsal surfaces of their limbs. The eyes are black with a deep blue scleral arc under the eyelid The call is an elongate series of low- frequency paired grunts, which to the human ear sound like slow gurgling, \\"wher-err, wher-err, wher-err, ‚Ä¶\\". Habitat and conservation Leptobrachium mangyanorum occurs in a wide variety of habitats, from pristine higher elevation forests to highly disturbed, near coastal regions; its elevational range is above sea level. Males seem to tolerate exposure and call from perches such as stumps and rocks, or on open forest floor or leaf litter. Male choruses are loose aggregations that stretch over some distance on the forest floor. The species is common along clear mountain streams and rivers, and seems to tolerate a degree of habitat disturbance. Nevertheless, habitat loss caused by shifting, slash-and-burn agriculture and small-scale wood collection is threatening this species. Furthermore, tadpoles are locally harvested for human consumption. It is present in the Mount Calavite Wildlife Sanctuary and Mounts Iglit‚ÄìBaco National Park.

Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The head is dorsoventrally flattened. The snout is rounded in dorsal view; males typically have more than 160 tiny black spines on the upper lip, whereas females have small white markings in generally similar positions. The tympanum is indistinct. The eyes are large and protuberant. The fingers have tapered tips and lateral fringes but no webbing. The toes have basal webbing and distinct lateral fringes. The dorsum is reddish brown to gray-brown with irregularly shaped black spots. The chest and throat are mostly white with some black mottling and many tiny dark-brown points. The iris is bicolored with light blue upper half and black lower half. Males have a single, internal subgular vocal sac. Habitat and conservation Leptobrachium promustache is known from slow-flowing forested streams: a pair was found under a stone within the stream at the type locality, and calling males were found beside the stream, usually from just beneath the soil surface. The Vietnamese specimens were found in leaf litter on the forest floor; the identity of the tadpoles from nearby streams needs confirmation. The elevational range of this species is above sea level.
