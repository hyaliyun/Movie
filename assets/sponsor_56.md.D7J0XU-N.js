Dal Riata, as a kingdom, appeared in Argyll in the early centuries AD, after the Romans had abandoned Scotland. Rulers of Argyll were Gaelic speakers. Dunadd is a hill on which they built a citadel. Description Dunadd is a rocky crag that may have been one time an island and now lies inland near the River Add, from which it takes its name, a little north of Lochgilphead (NR 836 936). The surrounding land, now largely reclaimed, was formerly boggy and known as the M√≤ine Mh√≤r 'Great Moss' in Gaelic. This no doubt increased the defensive potential of the site.Alan Lane and Ewan Campbell, Dunadd: An early Dalriadic capital (Oxbow Books, Oxford, 2000). Detailed analysis of sea-level changes in the region argue that the Dun was an island or promontory into historic times, and that receding sea levels left the fortification open to siege and seizure in the 6th to 7th centuries History alt=Boar carving in rock near top of the hill fort. Originally occupied in the Iron Age, the site later became a seat of the kings of D√°l Riata. It is known for its unique stone carvings below the upper enclosure, including a footprint and basin thought to have formed part of D√°l Riata's coronation ritual. On the same flat outcrop of rock is an incised boar in Pictish style, and an inscription in the ogham script. The inscription is read as referring to a Finn Manach and is dated to the late 8th century or after. Dunadd is mentioned twice in early sources. In 683 the Annals of Ulster record: \\"The siege of D√∫n At and the siege of D√∫n Duirn\\" without further comment on the outcome or participants. In the same chronicle the entry for 736 states: \\"Aengus son of Fergus, king of the Picts, laid waste the territory of D√°l Riata and seized D√∫n At and burned Creic and bound in chains two sons of Selbach, i.e. Donngal and Feradach.\\"The Annals of Ulster The site was occupied after 736, at least into the 9th century. It is mentioned twice in later sources, suggesting that it retained some importance. In 1436, it is recorded that \\"Alan son of John Riabhach MacLachlan of Dunadd\\" was made seneschal of the lands of Glassary; the chief place of residence of the MacLachlans of Dunadd lay below the fort. In June 1506, commissioners appointed by James IV, including the earl and bishop of Argyll, met at Dunadd to collect rents and resolve feuds. The site is an Ancient Monument, under the care of Historic Scotland, and is open to the public (open all year; no entrance charge). Excavations Because Dunadd is mentioned in early sources, and is readily identifiable, it has been excavated on several occasions (1904‚Äì05, 1929, 1980) and has one of the most important ensembles of finds from any early medieval site in Scotland. Finds range from the 6th to the 8th centuries AD. These include tools, weapons, quernstones, imported pottery and motif-pieces and moulds for the manufacture of fine metalwork (especially jewellery).  In fiction  In Rosemary Sutcliff's 1965 novel The Mark of the Horse Lord the Dal Riada undergo an internal struggle for control of royal succession, with Dun Monaidh central to the conflict, including a depiction of royal coronation and use of carved footprint. Dunadd is the location for Claire R. McDougall's novel \\"Veil of Time,\\" in which a modern-day woman is transported back to Dunadd's heyday in the 8th century. All the features of Dunadd, including the footprint, the boar, the well and the tumble down ruins are features of the story, as are the modern farm and cottages . Other ancient sites in the Kilmartin Valley also play a part in the narrative.

Calenberg was ruled by the House of Hanover from 1635 onwards; the princes received the ninth electoral dignity of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. Their territory became the nucleus of the Electorate of Hanover, ruled in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1714 onwards. The principality received its name from Calenberg Castle, a residence of the Brunswick dukes.  Territory  Coat of arms of the Calenberg-Grubenhagensche Landschaft on a building in G√∂ttingen When Duke Eric I of Brunswick-L√ºneburg chose the Principality of Calenberg as his part of the inheritance in 1495, he described it as \\"the land between the River Leine and the Deister\\". This geographical description, however, was never totally correct. In fact, the Principality extended west of the Leine from Schulenburg as far as Neustadt am R√ºbenberge in the north and thus much further north than the foothills of the Deister. To the south-west the territory stretched as far as Hamelin on the Weser, well beyond the Deister. The city of Hanover was largely independent of Welf territorial lordship, even though it was not formally a free imperial city. Not until George of Calenberg, who had been a successful general in the Thirty Years War, chose the city as his Residenz in 1636 could Hanover also be viewed as part of the Principality of Calenberg. Calenberg Castle was demolished and slighted between 1692 and 1694. Because of the link that had existed since 1463 between the principalities of Calenberg and G√∂ttingen, the latter was also sometimes referred to as Calenberg. Today the term Calenberg Land is usually only used for the region between Hanover and the Deister. History = Origins and foundation of Calenberg Castle = The remains of Calenberg Castle. Here, the battery tower at the main entrance Originally the territory belonged to the Duchy of Saxony but in 1180, after the imperial ban had been imposed on the Welf prince, Henry the Lion, he lost his ducal lands in Saxony and Bavaria. However, in 1235, Henry's grandson, Otto the Child, was promoted to the rank of prince as a result of the reconciliation between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Welf and was given the allodial estates of the family claimed by them in the area between L√ºneburg and Brunswick as the new and independent Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In the region west of Hanover, the Welfs had but few allodial possessions and so that area was disputed between the House of Welf and the bishops of Hildesheim and Minden. It was largely ruled by comital dynasties, such as the counts of W√∂lpe in the northwest, the counts of Hallermund in the southwest and the counts of Rhoden in the west and in Hanover. In 1292 Duke Otto the Strict from the L√ºneburg line of the Welfs subjugated the region. Earlier, he had yielded to the Bishop of Hildesheim and accepted the city of Hanover as his fief. However, he shook off his allegiance and founded Calenberg Castle, just 13 km west of Hildesheim, in a countermove in order to further reduce the power of the Bishop of Hildesheim in the Hanover area. Administratively, this area was initially still called the Vogtei of Lauenrode, after Lauenrode Castle on the outskirts of Hanover, from where, the Welfs ruled the territory. With the extinction of the L√ºneburg line of the Welfs, the L√ºneburg War of Succession, broke out (1371‚Äì88) during which Lauenrode Castle was stormed by the citizens of Hanover and destroyed. The Vogtei was then moved to Calenberg Castle. = Welf inheritance divisions = The Welf dukes did not inherit their land by primogeniture and this resulted in the late Middle Ages in numerous Welf estates and a great fragmentation of Welf territory. In 1400 the Vogtei of Calenberg went to the Wolfenb√ºttel line of the Welfs. In 1408 and 1409 they were able to purchase the county of Everstein and the lordship of Homburg after the extinction of their reigning families. These were added to the Vogtei of Calenberg. In a further Welf inheritance in 1432 - the ninth according to Gudrun Pischke - the area was divided again by the Welf dukes William the Victorious and Henry the Peaceful who had hitherto ruled jointly in the Principality of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel.The House of Brunswick at Leibnitiana. Retrieved on 25 Jun 2010. While Henry retained the Wolfenb√ºttel lands, William was compensated with the newly created Principality of Calenberg. At that time, the lordship given to William had no name. It consisted of the rights formerly owned by the Principality of L√ºneburg between the Deister range and the Leine river, as well as the former County of W√∂lpe, the lordship of Hallermund near Springe and the Homburg and Everstein dominions. As the Welf princes all carried the ducal title and the territories they ruled were principalities within the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, their dominions were named after the main castle or town. William spent most of his time at Calenberg Castle from where he administered the territory. As a result, it is probable that the name of the Principality of Calenberg emerged during this time. = Unification with G√∂ttingen = Between 1442 and 1463 William succeeded in taking over the rule over the Brunswick Principality of G√∂ttingen. Although unification with Calenberg initially came about purely by chance, it lasted nonetheless. In order to distinguish the two areas which were physically separated by the foothills of the uplands in the Leine valley, Calenberg in the north was usually referred to as Unterwald (\\"Lower Forest\\"), whilst the G√∂ttingen region was called the Oberwald (\\"Upper Forest\\"). When in 1473 William also inherited the Principality of Wolfenb√ºttel from his brother Henry who had left no heirs, he ceded sovereignty over Calenberg to his sons William the Younger and Frederick III, known as \\"the Restless\\" or \\"Turbulentus\\". After the death of William the Victorious in 1482 both sons shared the regency. In an agreement dated 1 August 1483, however, they split the rights of use (Mutschierung). The younger son, Frederick the Restless, was awarded the rights of use over Calenberg and G√∂ttingen, and his brother William the Younger was awarded the rule over Wolfenb√ºttel. Nevertheless, in 1484/85 William deposed his brother Frederick and declared him insane. The reasons for his removal are debated; perhaps by his participation in many armed conflicts, Frederick was seen to pose a threat to Welf rule in Calenberg and G√∂ttingen. So William succeeded - albeit only briefly - in re-uniting the entire territory of the principalities of Calenberg, Brunswick-G√∂ttingen and Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. After Frederick's death in 1495, however, William again divided his territories and left the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel to his elder son Henry V. = Under Eric I, Elisabeth and Eric II = Elisabeth ca. 1530 The younger son, Eric I received Calenberg and G√∂ttingen and thus founded the Calenberg line of the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In the new territory so formed, the name Calenberg was increasingly used for both parts of the state. For the period under Eric I and his son, Eric II, however, the name \\"Principality of Calenberg-G√∂ttingen\\" was also used a lot. The principality had separate parliamentary Estates and separate councils for each part. The chancellery for Unterwald was established in Neustadt on R√ºbenberge and that for Oberwald in M√ºnden. There were also separate residences, lordly castles or manor houses and palaces in each town as well as separate repositories for their records. Under Eric I, Calenberg Castle was expanded into a strong fortress. Another heavily fortified castle, which he had built, was the Erichsburg near Dassel on which construction began in 1527. In the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud in 1519 he was initially defeated militarily in the Battle of Soltau. Diplomatically, however, he was able to win a ruling from the Emperor Charles V that saw a large part of the Bishopric of Hildesheim added to his domain. Eric I was hostile to the emerging Protestant Reformation. His second wife, Elisabeth of Brandenburg, however, whom he married in 1525, switched over to the new doctrine in 1535 and promoted it at the court, which then resided at M√ºnden. After Eric's death in 1540 she took over the government for their underage son, Eric II, and implemented the Reformation in the Principality with the state superintendent Antonius Corvinus she had appointed. Eric II, however, converted to Roman Catholicism in 1547 even though he was raised as an Evangelical by his mother. He was not able to reverse the Reformation in the Principality however. His power in the principality was already very weak. He spent most of his time as a mercenary leader abroad, and was financially dependent on the towns. In 1553 he had to secure the financial aid of his towns by approving evangelical preaching. From 1574 he had Neustadt am R√ºbenberge developed as a fortified town and built Landestrost Castle within its walls as a Renaissance chateau, integrated into a bastion fortress based on the Italian model. In 1582 when the counts of Hoya died out, the larger part of the county went to Calenberg. In 1584 Calenberg also acquired the Diepholz. = Thirty Years' War = After Eric's death in 1584 Calenberg- G√∂ttingen was again ruled by the Wolfenb√ºttel line of the Welfs. In the Thirty Years' War the brother of Duke Frederick Ulrich, \\"mad\\" Christian, brought the war to the state. After Danish troops under King Christian IV, who was then commander of the Lower Saxon Circle, was defeated by the general of the Catholic League, Tilly in the Battle of Lutter, Tilly occupied the whole principality in 1626. Only the cities of Brunswick and Hanover could not be captured. When Duke Frederick Ulrich died childless in 1634 the Wolfenb√ºttel line of the Middle House of Brunswick ended with him. In 1635 Duke Augustus the Elder from the Middle House of L√ºneburg received the Principality of Calenberg-G√∂ttingen.Georg (George) of Calenberg at Leibnitiana. Retrieved on 25 Jun 2010. After his death in 1636 his younger brother George became its ruler. He was successful as a general on the Swedish side and he also succeeded in 1637 in recovering the country and especially the towns for the Welfs. He initially ruled out of occupied Hildesheim, but then moved his residence to Hanover, which he also had built as a fortress. After his death in 1641 a separate peace was hastily concluded with the emperor, which had to be paid for by the return of the land acquired during the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud. George's sons, Christian Louis, George William, John Frederick and Ernest Augustus then ruled the Principality of Calenberg-G√∂ttingen in succession. = Elevation to an electorate = In 1665 the Principality of Grubenhagen, whose line had died out in 1596 and over which the lines of L√ºneburg and Wolfenb√ºttel had long fought in the Imperial Chamber Court, was also finally added to the Calenberg dynasty. George's youngest son, Ernest Augustus, who ruled from 1679, carried on the successful policies of his father and his brothers. In 1689 the Calenbergs also inherited Saxe-Lauenburg. Ernest Augustus switched to the side of the Emperor and introduced primogeniture, contrary to the direction of his father. In 1692 for his services to the Emperor, Ernest Augustus was rewarded after a long struggle with the title of the ninth electorate. Officially he was now the Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and his government was called the \\"Electoral Brunswick- L√ºneburg Government\\".\\"the electors themselves placed great value on the title \\"Brunswick-L√ºneburg\\", a description which is almost always used in the official titles and documents of the electorate, Niemeyer / Ortenburg 1976: 7. Unofficially, it was also referred to as the Electorate of Hanover or Kurhannover In 1705 it was enhanced further by the inheritance of the Principality of L√ºneburg, whereby all the estates of the Welfs, apart from the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, became united under the line also known as the House of Hanover from which the British royal throne are descended.  Economic and social history  The Principality of Calenberg was initially a rather insignificant territory and Welf lordship developed here quite late. By the reign of George of Calenberg in 1636, the principality had experienced 140 years of almost continuously poor government that cared little about the state. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the cultural centres lay outside Calenberg in the towns of Brunswick, Hildesheim and L√ºneburg. New centres were created at the residences of Wolfenb√ºttel and Celle. Even the city of Hanover was not governed by the Calenberg princes until 1636. The other towns remained unimportant. Only after the reign of George of Calenberg and its subsequent elevation to the electorate did the former Principality of Calenberg become the nucleus of what later became the German state of Lower Saxony. Industrialization had already begun during the liberal French period. The industrialist, Johann Egestorff (1772‚Äì1834), used the economic opportunities of the years from 1803 to 1813 and was able to purchase limestone quarries on the hill of the Lindener Berg, west of Hanover. To burn the lime he had coal mined in the Deister hills. His son, Georg Egestorff, started an iron foundry and engineering company. The Calenberg village of Linden then developed into an industrial town. The population of Calenberg in 1846 was 186,000.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vo.IV, (1848) London, Charles Knight, p.38 Princes of Calenberg * William the Victorious 1432-1473, acquired the Principality of G√∂ttingen in 1463, became Prince of Wolfenb√ºttel in 1473 =House of Calenberg= * Eric I 1494-1540, grandson, G√∂ttingen annexed in 1495, remained part of the Calenberg lands thereafter * Eric II 1545-1584, son On Eric II's death, Calenberg was acquired by the descendants of Henry IV who ruled in Wolfenb√ºttel: =House of Wolfenb√ºttel= * Julius 1584-1589, grandson of Henry IV * Henry Julius 1589-1613, son * Frederick Ulrich 1613-1634, son Upon Frederick Ulrich's death, his lands were divided between the houses of L√ºneburg and Dannenberg, the former gaining Calenberg and the latter Wolfenb√ºttel. =House of L√ºneburg= * George of L√ºneburg-Celle, 1635‚Äì1641 * Christian Louis, 1641‚Äì1648, son * George William 1648-1665, brother * John Frederick 1665-1679, brother * Ernest Augustus 1679-1698, brother (designated as the first new prince-elector) * George Louis 1698-1705, son -- became George I of Great Britain.

It is also the seat of the Regional Municipality of Niagara. The Welland Canal passes through the centre of the city, and the Twin Flight Locks, located downtown, attract thousands of tourists annually. History The first survey of Thorold, or Township 9 as it was known then, occurred in 1788. The earliest communities in what is now Thorold emerged at Beaverdams, DeCew Falls and St. Johns but, after the opening of the First Welland Canal in 1829, they were superseded by the new canal villages of Thorold, Allanburg and Port Robinson. In 1846, the community had a population of about 1,000 and there were three churches or chapels and a post office. Various types of tradesmen worked here. Industry included two grist mills, a cement mill, a brewery and three wagon makers. There were seven taverns. Thorold, located on the brow of the Niagara Escarpment, soon became dominant and was incorporated as a village in 1850 and as a town in 1870. When the Regional Municipality of Niagara was formed in 1970, the Town of Thorold expanded to include the former Thorold Township. In 1975 the town became incorporated as the City of Thorold. Thorold is also the location of the War of 1812 battle site, Beaverdams, where, on June 25, 1813, Colonel Charles Boerstler and his American troops were defeated by a force of 80 British regulars and 300 Caughnawaga Mohawks. Geography The city includes the neighbourhoods of Allanburg, Beaverdams, Confederation Heights, Port Robinson, St. Johns, Rolling Meadows, Thorold South and Turner's Corners. St. Johns was one of the first areas in the interior of Niagara Peninsula to be settled by Europeans. The first Europeans settled in the area about 1792, when a sawmill was built on St. Johns Creek, a tributary of the Twelve Mile Creek. It was one of only two mills in Niagara at the time. In 1804, St. Johns became home to the first free school in Upper Canada, housed in a single-room, wooden schoolhouse. By the time a post office was established in 1831, the community included a woollen factory, a tannery, a foundry, stores, and a number of mills. Eventually, the hydro power offered by the site became less of a commodity. As industry in surrounding towns grew, St. Johns' affluence declined. Arts and culture Thorold is home to several festivals and annual events. Included are: * Mountain Top Ceremony - Held at the Lock 7 Viewing Complex, this annual celebration marks the opening of the Welland Canal shipping season with the arrival of the first ship of the year through Lock 3. Usually held in late March. * The Canal Bank Shuffle - A three-day annual festival of music and dance in the downtown core. Features blues musicians. * The Can-View 4 drive-in theatre complex, located near the intersection of highways 20 and 406, is the only one of its kind in the Niagara Region. Attractions =Trails= The Welland Canal Parkway Trail is a paved recreational path beginning in St. Catharines at Lake Ontario and ending at Lake Erie in Port Colborne.

DeCou. It served as the area's British headquarters during the War of 1812. On June 22, 1813, Laura Secord journeyed from Queenston to DeCew House to warn Lieutenant James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack. FitzGibbon and his men were able to capture the American force and help turn the tide of the war. The house was destroyed by fire in 1950 but the site is commemorated by the rebuilt foundation and a plaque. The Old Fire Hall At 12 Albert Street West, was constructed next to the Second Welland Canal in 1878. This building once housed Thorold's police force and, to this day, contains a jail in the basement. For many years, the fire bell tolled for the town's strictly enforced nine o'clock curfew. The Old Firehall was designed by the architect John Latshaw and built for $2,483. It has a combination bell tower and hose tower, yellow and red brickwork, semi-circular wood windows, and a circular wood window in the gable end at the tower. Decorative yellow brick arches frame each window. The bell which hung in its tower remained in use until 1964, when the fire department moved into its new hall on nearby Towpath Street. In 1967 the old bell was installed outside the new firehall. The \\"Old Hall\\" was used as the Thorold YMCA for several years thereafter. Chestnut Hall At 14 Ormond Street North, is a carefully restored 1862 building that was once home to John McDonagh, a lumber merchant and mayor of the Town of Thorold from 1881‚Äì1884. Chestnut Hall currently houses the Thorold & Beaverdams Historical Society, in addition to the Thorold Museum and part of the Thorold Public Library. St. Johns School House On Hollow Road, is a single-room wooden school house located in the west portion of Thorold. Opening in 1804, it was the first free school in Upper Canada. The first teacher at the school was Samuel Birdsall. The enrolment in 1826 was recorded as 29 students. The building was fully restored in 1974. Maplehurst At 14 Saint David's Road West, is a Thorold landmark and the former home of Jacob Keefer. The mansion sits on the highest rise in the city offering a commanding view of the community below. Built by Hugh Keefer in 1885, this red stone structure with elaborate gables and dormers has been variously used in the past as a residence, a hospital, and a private nursing home. Maplehurst was recently restored to its original condition and is currently known as the Keefer Mansion, a 10-room inn. Welland Mills At 20 Pine Street North, was constructed in 1846 on the bank of the second Welland Canal by Jacob Keefer and, at that time, it contained the largest watermill in Canada. The Keefers were entrepreneurs and are considered one of Thorold's founding families. At its height, the mill was capable of manufacturing 300 barrels (89 tonnes) of flour per day and storing 70,000 bushels (1,900 tonnes) of wheat and 5,000 barrels (440 tonnes) of flour. Today, the Welland Mills building has been restored offering commercial space on the ground floor and residential apartments above. Beaverdams Methodist Church and Cemetery On Marlatt's Road, was constructed in 1832. Beaverdams Church is the oldest Methodist Church still standing in Ontario. The first minister to preach in the chapel was Reverend Egerton Ryerson, who is largely responsible for founding the province of Ontario's education system. Soldiers' Monument A war memorial monument that commemorates World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Located in Memorial Park, at the corner of Albert and Chapel streets, it was unveiled on Sunday, October 30, 1921 and was erected by the citizens of Thorold to: \\"Honour the Memory of the Men of Thorold, who gave their lives for the cause of freedom in the great war, and in grateful remembrance of those who shared its dangers.\\" The Old Public Library At 1 Ormond Street South, is one of 156 Carnegie libraries to have been funded in Canada. The building, designed by architect A.E. Nicholson, was opened in 1912. The library moved from here to its present home in Chestnut Hall in 1983. The building now serves as office space.

Unlike the standard system, it maintains the \\"n\\" even when it's followed by \\"homorganic consonants\\" (e.g., shinbun, not shimbun). The Kenmu Restoration was an effort made by Emperor Go-Daigo to overthrow the ruling Kamakura Shogunate and restore the Imperial House to power in Japan, returning to civilian government after 148 years of de facto military government from Kamakura.Sansom 1977: 22-42. Go-Daigo launched the Genk≈ç War in 1331 against the Kamakura Shogunate but was defeated and exiled to the Oki Islands. Go-Daigo launched a second uprising and with the assistance of the defected Kamakura general Ashikaga Takauji defeated the Kamakura Shogunate at the Siege of Kamakura in 1333. The Imperial House was restored to power but Go-Daigo's policies failed to satisfy his samurai supporters and most Japanese people. The Kenmu Restoration was ultimately overthrown when Takauji became Sh≈çgun and founded the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1336, beginning the \\"Northern and Southern Courts\\" period and the Muromachi period. The Kenmu Restoration was the last time the Emperor of Japan had any power until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.  Background  The Emperor's role had been usurped by the Minamoto and H≈çj≈ç families ever since Minamoto no Yoritomo had obtained from the Emperor the title of sh≈çgun in 1192, ruling thereafter from Kamakura. For various reasons, the Kamakura shogunate decided to allow two contending imperial lines‚Äîknown as the Southern Court or junior line, and the Northern Court or senior line‚Äîto alternate on the throne. The method worked for several successions until a member of the Southern Court ascended to the throne as Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo wanted to overthrow the shogunate and openly defied Kamakura by naming his own son his heir. In 1331 the shogunate exiled Go-Daigo but loyalist forces, including Kusunoki Masashige, rebelled and came to his support. They were aided by, among others, future sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji, a samurai who had turned against Kamakura when dispatched to put down Go-Daigo's rebellion. At roughly the same time, Nitta Yoshisada, another eastern chieftain, attacked the shogunate's capital. The shogunate tried to resist his advance: Yoshisada and shogunate forces fought several times along the Kamakura Kaid≈ç, for example at , (both near today's Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture), and Bubaigawara, in today's Fuch≈´, ever closer to Kamakura. The city was finally reached, besieged, and taken. Kamakura would remain for one century the political capital of the Kant≈ç region, but its supremacy was over.  Objectives of the restoration  When Emperor Go-Daigo ascended the throne in 1318, he immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura. Historical documents show that, disregarding evidence to the contrary, he and his advisers believed that a revival of the Imperial House was possible, and that the Kamakura's shogunate was the greatest and most obvious of the obstacles. Another situation that begged for a solution was the land-ownership problem posed by the manors and their lands (see the article sh≈çen). The great landowners (shugo (governors) and jit≈ç (manor's lord)), with their political independence and their tax exemptions were impoverishing the government and undermining its authority, and Kitabatake Chikafusa, Daigo's future chief adviser, discussed the situation in his works on succession. Chikafusa admitted that nobody had any intention of abolishing those privileges, so the hope of success on this front was from the beginning clearly very dim. What he planned to replace shugo and jit≈ç with is unclear, but he surely had no intention of sharing power with the samurai class. However serious the land ownership problem, Daigo and his advisers made no serious effort to solve it, partly because it was samurai from the manors in the western provinces that had defeated the shogunate for him. In such a situation, any effort to regulate the manors was bound to cause resentment among key allies.  Failure of Go-Daigo's policies  Emperor Go-Daigo The Emperor reclaimed the property of some manors his family had previously lost control of, rewarding with them, among others, Buddhist temples like T≈ç-ji and Daitoku-ji in the hope to obtain their support. He however failed to protect the rights of tenants and workers, whose complaints poured into the monasteries. He did not understand the importance to him of the warrior class either, because he never properly rewarded his minor samurai supporters, as he could have done using lands from the confiscated H≈çj≈ç lands, indulging instead in favoritism. These errors are the key to understanding the events of the next few decades. After rewarding religious institutions, he prepared to redistribute H≈çj≈ç lands, and samurai came to him in great numbers to lay their claims. The biggest rewards were given to samurai, among them Nitta Yoshisada, the man who had destroyed the Kamakura shogunate, and Ashikaga Takauji. In so doing, however, he failed to return control of the provinces to civilians. But he made his greatest error when he failed to properly reward minor warriors who had supported him. The tribunals set up to the purpose were inefficient and too inexperienced for the task, and corruption was rife. Samurai anger was made worse by the fact that Go-Daigo, wanting to build a palace for himself but having no funds, levied extra taxes from the samurai class. A wave of enmity towards the nobility started to run through the country, growing stronger with time. The Taiheiki also records that, although Takauji and Yoshisada were richly rewarded, the offices of shugo and jito in more than fifty provinces went to nobles and court bureaucrats, leaving no spoils for the warriors.Hall and Duus 1990: 184-7. By the end of 1335 the Emperor and the nobility had lost all support of the warrior class.  Rise of the Ashikaga brothers  A portrait of Ashikaga Takauji bearing his son Yoshiakira's cipher Go-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending a sh≈çgun there, as this was seen as still too dangerous. As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to Mutsu Province (the eastern part of today's T≈çhoku region, stretching from Fukushima Prefecture in the south to Aomori Prefecture in the north) and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and Dewa Provinces. In an obvious reply to this move, Ashikaga Takauji's younger brother Tadayoshi without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old Nariyoshi (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as Governor of the K≈çzuke Province with himself as a deputy and de facto ruler.Kamakura Sh≈çk≈ç Kaigijo 2008: 24‚Äì25. The appointment of a warrior to an important post was intended to show the Emperor that the samurai class was not ready for a purely civilian rule. Later, a third son of Go- Daigo's, Prince Morinaga, was appointed sei-i taish≈çgun together with his brother Norinaga, a move that immediately aroused Ashikaga Takauji's hostility.Shirai 1976: 301‚Äì302.In his \\"History of Japan\\" (see references), George Sansom states that Prince Morinaga was not in fact appointed sh≈çgun. This is surely an error, because contradicted by more recent and reliable sources both in English and Japanese, for example Shirai and Hall. Takauji believed the military class had the right to rule and considered himself not a usurper but, since the Ashikaga descended from a branch of the Minamoto clan, rather a restorer of Minamoto power. When the H≈çj≈ç garrison at Rokuhara was destroyed in 1333, he immediately stepped in and installed there his office (bugy≈çsho). It kept order in the city and in general took over the original's function. Extending its authority to controlling travel along highways, issuing passports and exercising rights previously belonging to the shogunate's deputies (the Rokuhara Tandai), Takauji showed he believed that samurai political power must continue. His setting himself apart as a representative of the military made him an aggregation point for the warriors' discontent. Samurai saw him as the man who could bring back the shogunate's heyday, and therefore his strength was superior to that of any other samurai, Nitta Yoshisada included. His only obstacle to the shogunate was Prince Morinaga.  Prince Morinaga  Prince Morinaga's statue at Kamakura-g≈´ in Kamakura Prince Morinaga, with his prestige and his devotion to the civilian government cause, was Takauji's natural enemy and could count therefore on the support of his adversaries, among them Nitta Yoshisada, whom Takauji had offended. Tension between the Emperor and the Ashikaga gradually grew, until Takauji had Morinaga arrested on a pretext and first confined him in Kyoto, then transported him to Kamakura, where the Prince was kept prisoner until late August 1335. The situation in Kamakura continued to be tense, with H≈çj≈ç supporters staging sporadic revolts here and there. In the course of the same year H≈çj≈ç Tokiyuki, son of last regent Takatoki, tried to re-establish the shogunate by force and defeated Tadayoshi in Musashi, in today's Kanagawa Prefecture. Tadayoshi had to flee, so before leaving he ordered the beheading of Prince Morinaga. Kamakura was therefore temporarily in Tokiyuki's hands. Heard the news, Takauji asked the Emperor to make him sei-i tai-sh≈çgun so that he could quell the revolt and help his brother. When his request was denied, Takauji organized his forces and returned to Kamakura without the Emperor's permission, defeating the H≈çj≈ç. He then installed himself in Kamakura's Nikaid≈ç neighborhood.Sansom says Ashikaga was staying at a temple called Eifuku-ji. This is an error, because Takauji in 1335 is known to have stayed at the bett≈ç's residence at , a famous temple in Nikaid≈ç built by Minamoto no Yoritomo which disappeared at some point during the 15th century. Y≈çfuku-ji was a traditional vacation residence of the sh≈çguns, and the characters in its name are indeed usually read \\"Eifuku-ji\\". See the article Nikaid≈ç. When invited to return to Kyoto, he let it be known through his brother Tadayoshi that he felt safer where he was, and started to build himself a mansion in ≈åkura, where first Kamakura sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoritomo's residence had been.  Civil war  Kyoto by then was aware that Takauji had assumed wide powers without imperial permission, for example nominating an Uesugi clan member to the post of Constable of K≈çzuke, Nitta Yoshisada's native province. By late 1335 several thousand of the emperor's men were ready to go to Kamakura, while a great army at the command of K≈ç no Moroyasu was rushing there to help it resist the attack. On November 17, 1335, Tadayoshi issued a message in his brother's name asking all samurai to join the Ashikaga and destroy Nitta Yoshisada. The Court, meanwhile, had done the opposite, ordering samurai from all provinces to join Yoshisada and destroy the two Ashikaga. The war started with most samurai convinced that Takauji was the man they needed to have their grievances redressed, and most peasants were persuaded that they had been better off under the shogunate. The campaign was therefore enormously successful for the Ashikaga, with huge numbers of samurai rushing to join the two brothers. By February 23 of the following year Nitta Yoshisada and the Emperor had lost, and Kyoto itself had fallen. On February 25, 1336, Ashikaga Takauji entered the capital and the Kenmu Restoration ended.  Calendrical peculiarities of the era  The Kenmu era is in the anomalous condition of having two different durations. Because Japanese era names (neng≈ç) change with the Emperor and the Imperial House split in two after 1336, the Kenmu era was counted by the two sides in two different ways. \\"Kenmu\\" is the era after the Genk≈ç era, and it is understood to have spanned the years 1334 through 1336 before the beginning of the \\"Engen\\" era, as time was reckoned by the Southern Court; and it is concurrently said to have spanned the years 1334 through 1338 before Ryaku≈ç, as time was reckoned by the rival Northern Court. Because the Southern Court, the loser, is nonetheless considered the legitimate one, its time reckoning is the one used by historians.

Neuerburg went down with his boat. Design German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-869 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged.

She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-869 was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a Flak M42 as well as two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of 48. Service history U-869 conducted one World War II war patrol without success. It suffered no casualties to its crew until it was lost in February 1945, with all but one of 56 crew members dead. The surviving crew member, Herbert Guschewski, was not on board, as he became ill just before the patrol. Robert Kurson chronicled the story of U-869s finding in the book Shadow Divers (2004). =Supposed sinking off Africa= On 28 February 1945, the American destroyer escort and the French submarine chaser L'Indiscret conducted a depth charge attack on a submerged contact in the Atlantic, near Rabat, and reported a kill, although little visible evidence was presented to confirm the kill. Based on the information provided, U.S. Naval Intelligence rated the attacks \\"G‚ÄîNo Damage\\". U-869 had been previously ordered by Karl D√∂nitz to move its area of operations from the North American coast to the Gibraltar area. Postwar investigators upgraded the rating from \\"G‚ÄîNo Damage\\" to \\"B‚ÄîProbably Sunk\\", leading to an erroneous historical record that U-869 was sunk near Gibraltar. For many years this attack was assumed to have been its end. =Discovery off U.S. coast= In 1991, Bill Nagle, a former wreck diver and the captain of Seeker, learned about a wreck off New Jersey and decided to mount a diving expedition to the site. On 2 September 1991, an unidentified U-boat wreck was discovered 73 meters (240 feet) deep (a hazardous depth for standard scuba diving) off the coast of New Jersey. Nicknamed U-Who, the exact identity of the wreck was a matter of frequent debate, and initially the wreck was thought to be either or . The discoverers of U-Who, John Chatterton, Richie Kohler, and Kevin Brennan, continued to dive the wreck for the next several years, taking considerable risks. (Three divers, Steve Feldman, Chris Rouse and \\"Chrissy\\" Rouse, died exploring U-869.) Eventually, the team recovered a knife inscribed with \\"Horenburg\\", a crew member's name. However, they learned at the U-boat archives that U-869 was supposedly sent to Africa, so this piece of evidence was initially disregarded. A few years later, they found part of the UZO torpedo aiming device, and spare parts from the motor room engraved with serial and other identifying numbers. On 31 August 1997 they concluded that the boat they found was U-869. The location of the wreck is approximately . =Cause of sinking= The men who found U-869 believed it was a victim of its own torpedo, which may have become a \\"circle-runner\\". Torpedoes manufactured later in the war had acoustical seeking capability. It was theorized that the torpedo was initially fired in a turning pattern and when it missed its target, it picked up the sound of the submarine's propeller. At least two other German U-boats supposedly have been lost due to their own torpedoes: in 1944 and in late 1943. Chatterton and Kohler based their theory largely on a lack of evidence to support other causes for sinking. They claimed there was no reported naval activity in the vicinity, thereby ruling out a sinking by attack. Moreover, the damage to the hull was from the outside and thereby ruled out an internal explosion. This problem also affected the US submarine force at least twice, as seen with and . Gary Gentile, a noted wreck diver, researcher, and author, rejects Chatteron and Kohler's theory. He cites attack logs and eyewitness accounts from the crew of two destroyer escorts suggesting that the U-boat was initially damaged with a hedgehog launched by the and then subsequently damaged with a depth charge by the accompanying . The United States Coast Guard, in its official evaluation of the evidence, discarded the circle- running torpedo theory and awarded the sinking to the two destroyers. This was confirmed by Marlyn Berkey, who was on a destroyer as part of the Pacific fleet entering New York Harbor after the war's end; the submarine showed up on sonar, Berkey's destroyer depth charged the sub, it sank as evidenced by oil and debris that floated on the surface; the destroyer's crew was allowed to place a broom upside down atop the mainmast coming into New York, which meant \\"clean sweep\\". Contributing to their findings are two damage holes in the wreck of U-869, which are more consistent with the attack reports that cited two explosions than with the circle runner theory which would only explain one hole. The official records state that U-869 was destroyed on 11 February 1945 by two U.S. destroyer escorts, Howard D. Crow and Koiner. John Chatterton, one of the divers who discovered U-869 in 1991, states in Wreck Diving Magazine his belief that the two U.S. destroyer escorts attacked the wreck of U-869 after the U-boat had been struck by its own torpedo. Only one crew member survived by virtue of not having been aboard. Second Radio Officer Herbert Guschewski came down with pneumonia and pleurisy shortly before the boat's departure. Like the families of the crew, Guschewski did not know what happened to his fellow sailors until 1999. He watched a program which eventually became the PBS NOVA episode \\"Hitler's Lost Sub\\" and contacted the producers shortly afterward, who interviewed him and placed a portion of it in the 2000 American broadcast.

It is the largest town in and seat of Northumberland County. Its nearest neighbour is Port Hope, to the west. It is located along Highway 401 (exits 472 and 474) and the former Highway 2 (now Northumberland County Road 2). To the south, Cobourg borders Lake Ontario. To the north, east and west, it is surrounded by Hamilton Township. History The land which present-day Cobourg occupies was previously inhabited by Mississauga (Anishinaabe-speaking) peoples.Copy of the treaty made October 31, 1923 between his Majesty the King and the Chippewa Indians of Christian Island, Georgina Island and Rama Reprinted 1967. ¬©Roger Duhamel, F.R.S.C..

Some of the founding fathers and early settlers were Eliud Nickerson, Joseph Ash, Zacheus Burnham and Asa Allworth Burnham. The Town was originally a group of smaller villages such as Amherst and Hardscrabble, which were later named Hamilton. In 1808 it became the district town for the Newcastle District. It was renamed Cobourg in 1818, in recognition of the marriage of Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who would later become King of Belgium). By the 1830s, Cobourg had become a regional centre, much due to its fine harbour on Lake Ontario. In 1835 the Upper Canada Academy was established in Cobourg by Egerton Ryerson and the Wesleyan Conference of Bishops. On 1 July 1837, Cobourg was officially incorporated as a town. In 1841 the Upper Canada Academy's name was changed to Victoria College. In 1842 Victoria College was granted powers to confer degrees. Victoria College remained in Cobourg until 1892, when it was moved to Toronto and federated with the University of Toronto. In 1842, John Strachan founded the Diocesan Theological Institute in Cobourg, an Anglican seminary that became integrated into the University of Trinity College in Toronto in 1852. =The Railway to Rice Lake = The timber and other resources of Cobourg's large hinterland were identified as the key to its prosperity, and if they could be brought to the harbour, Lake Ontario opened up a large and prosperous market. Peterborough to the north, founded in 1825 by Peter Robinson, had become the principal source area, and in the 1830s the waterways were still the prime method of bulk transport. Rice Lake and the Otonabee River were brought into use when James Gray Bethune established a steamer running across the lake and up the Otonabee which was navigable through to Peterborough. This meant goods and passengers could be brought at least to the south shore of Rice Lake. The remaining 8 miles of rough tracks was viable for passengers and light goods, but no use for the valuable timber and mine products. By 1835, only 10 years after the first steam railway in the world, there was active discussion about building a railway up to what later became Harwood. However, the townspeople invested instead in a plank road, using 300,000 feet of 3-inch wooden planks, allowing horse-drawn vehicles to haul heavy goods. By 1850 the plank road was breaking up, and was impassible in wet conditions, so the railway scheme was revived. By 1852 there was considerable enthusiasm for the railway project within the town. Unfortunately river traffic had become seen as yesterday's solution by this time, so the plans were expanded to include a long bridge across Rice Lake, to take the railway right up to Peterborough. By 1854 the rails reached the shore of the lake, and it found good work transporting passengers and nearly 2 million feet of lumber from the Rice Lake down to Cobourg that summer. However, all the revenue had to ploughed into building an ill-fated bridge, using hundreds of wooden trestles, 31 Burr Truss spans, and a centre-pivot swing bridge to allow boats to pass. The prime mover locally for getting the Railway company off the ground was D'Arcy E. Boulton, a lawyer based in Cobourg, who enthused the town with the plan. They agreed to begin funding the scheme that was initially expected to cost ¬£150,000, but ended leaving many people with worthless railway bonds and the town council with a debt that was only finally repaid in the 1930s. The man appointed to manage the project was Samuel Zimmerman, who had previously been instrumental in building the Great Western Railway (Ontario). The bridge was constructed over the summer of 1854 and was officially opened on 29 December that year. Three days later it collapsed when ice movements shifted the trestles out of line, splintering the Burr Truss sections. The proposed solution was to stabilise the trestles (or 'stilts' as their critics dubbed them) by an infill of soil, which did happen on the southern side, still visible as a strip of land still remaining running into the lake near Harwood. But funds were not forthcoming for the northern side, and winter ice and shifting lake mud meant that it was frequently unusable. A further problem emerged when Port Hope, not far along the coast, pursued its own plans for a Railway to Peterborough. In 1857 the Port Hope and Lindsay line was constructed, and the following year opened a branch to Peterborough, going round the western end of the lake, in direct competition with the struggling Cobourg route. The response of the Cobourg directors was to oust D.E. Boulton, who then invested in the Port Hope line. Conflicts of interest among various personnel resulted in deliberately removing the bolts on sections of the bridge in early 1861, ensuring that the ice again the bridge was destroyed, and this time it was left unrepaired. The railway reverted to linking Cobourg harbour with Harwood and the Rice Lake water traffic. In 1865 the railway was bought by a consortium of Pittsburgh steel manufacturers, who had already bought the Marmora Iron quarries north-east of Rice Lake, who set up an iron-ore supply route in barges up the Trent River and across Rice Lake to the railway at Harwood. From there it was brought along the Railway to Cobourg Harbour, for shipment across Lake Ontario to feed the steel mills of America. This provided a steady income for the railway and the town until the ore ran out in 1878. It also had two longer term spin-offs in the form of a rail car company and the beginnings of a tourist industry. Crossen Car Works When the iron ore scheme was getting underway, a small iron foundry based in Cobourg, was approached to cast the wheels and frames of wagons to move the Marmora iron ore down to the harbour. James Crossen saw an opportunity to combine his cast-iron products with the abundant local timber to produce railway rolling stock. With the foundry located near both the Cobourg line and train station of the Grand Trunk Railway, which had been built along the shore of Lake Ontario in 1856, it was well placed to expand as Canada's railway network grew. It was later named the Crossen Car Manufacturing Company and went on to become the largest builder of timber- framed rail cars in Canada, making everything from coal and freight wagons through to dining cars and first-class carriages. By 1910 wood was going out of date, when all-steel cars took over, and in 1915 the company, unable to adapt, went into liquidation, and parts of the site reverted to being an iron foundry. A replica of one of the Crossen ore cars was built in 2016 and is on display near Cobourg waterfront. Wealthy Americans The connections and trade links which developed through the iron shipments brought many American industrialists to Cobourg, which became a popular summer destination. High class hotels were established, followed in the late 19th century and early 20th century by enormous summer homes for wealthy Americans, a few of which still stand today. One notable home, on King Street East, became the Brookside School - now a youth detention centre. A major ferry service connected Cobourg and Rochester, New York from 1907 to 1952, transporting passengers and cargo across Lake Ontario, allowing Americans to reach the town more readily. =Victoria Hall= For a brief moment in 1856 the town, with both its new railway link to the interior and an east-west rail connection along the Grand Trunk Railway, was feeling secure in its future prosperity, and thought a new Town Hall would encourage further investment and be an asset to the area. Victoria Hall stands at the heart of the downtown, a building that now serves as the town hall, as well as home of the Art Gallery of Northumberland, the Cobourg Concert Hall, and an Old Bailey-style courtroom that is now used as the Council chamber. Victoria Hall was designed by architect Kivas Tully. The landmark is known for its impressive stone work. Charles Thomas Thomas (1820-1867), an English-born master stonecarver and building contractor, executed the fine stone carvings, including the bearded faced keystone over the main entrance into the building. Victoria Hall was officially opened in 1860 by the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VII. At that time, Cobourg was a significant town in the Province of Canada, and some townspeople felt that Cobourg would be a suitable capital for the newly united provinces; this privilege went to Ottawa, Ontario, however. =Heritage Centre= One of the oldest buildings in the town was for many years known as The Barracks, suggesting military connections. However it is equally likely that it was built for industrial uses, either in the very early 1800s or as a malting house and brewery by James Calcutt in the early 1830s. It probably served that purpose until a larger brewery was built by the McKechnies in 1863. The old stone-built building had a variety of industrial and storage purposes, and twenty different owners. In 2000 it was acquired in a run-down state by the Cobourg Museum Foundation, who have restored it and it is now open as the Sifton-Cook Heritage Centre. =Crash landing= On 20 December 1951, Cobourg experienced media attention as a chartered Curtiss C-46 Commando airplane, bound for Newark, New Jersey, made an emergency landing in local farmer Charles Wilson's field, alongside Highway 2 and Roger's Road. The pilot had lost his way after losing radio contact, and unwittingly drifted north. The 44 passengers and three crew escaped unhurt, but extremely cold in the sub-zero temperatures. The plane, having crash landed on deep snow, was able to be repaired and the field smoothed out enough for it to get airborne again. Cobourg was the site of No. 26 Ordnance Depot, later Canadian Forces Station Cobourg, from 1953 to 1971. =Regeneration= Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, the town invested heavily in purchasing property along the waterfront and beautifying the area. A boardwalk was developed to connect the harbour and large sandy beach while further pathways were created to encompass Victoria Park and the historic downtown. Because of this renewal and revitalization, many community activities now revolve in and around these spaces. Climate Cobourg has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with warm summers and cold winters. Transportation Highway 401 and Northumberland County Road 2 (formerly Highway 2) pass through town. County Road 45 (formerly Highway 45) begins in Cobourg and heads north-east to Norwood. The Canadian Pacific and Canadian National main railway lines (Toronto ‚Äì Ottawa/Montreal) traverse the town. Via Rail offers passenger service to Cobourg railway station with multiple daily departures on the Toronto ‚Äì Ottawa/Montreal route. Cobourg Transit is a fully accessible community transit system that provides daily bus service to the town. The community transit system ends its runs by 7pm, which can hamper travel for those without other means of transportation. It formerly ran until 9:30pm however the hours were reduced. The Ontario Waterfront Trail passes through Cobourg and cyclists can be found moving through daily during the warmer months. Demographics 2006 census.

The downtown is a well-preserved example of a traditional small-town main street. Victoria Hall, the town hall completed in 1860, is a National Historic Site of Canada. The oldest building in the town is now open as the Sifton Cook Heritage Centre and operated by the Cobourg Museum Foundation. Downtown Cobourg, Ontario, Canada. Aerial View taken from a DJI Phantom Vision Cobourg has several parks. The Cobourg Waterfront Festival, held in Victoria Park and the nearby beach and harbour, is an annual arts and crafts event occurring on Canada Day. It began in 1987 as part of the town's sesquicentennial celebrations, and was conceived by the Art Gallery of Northumberland's former Director/Curator Peter Tulumello and former Concert Hall Manager Mark Finnan. Cobourg's oldest annual event, the Cobourg Highland Games, was started in 1963 in Donegan Park by Dave Carr to celebrate the Scottish culture in the area. The event was moved to Victoria Park in 2013, where it continues each June. Cobourg's beach, Victoria Park Beach, is used as a location for volleyball tournaments, events, beach days, family picnics and other events. The beach is equipped with a splash park, playground set, park area for eating, local restaurants and a pier. There are lifeguards on duty some days and it is safe to swim and play in. Close to the downtown, tourists can shop in local shops and eat out at many of Cobourg's restaurants. Cobourg is home to the Port Hope Drive-In, Canada's oldest drive-in.

The nearest cities are Woodstock to the east and London to the west. Ingersoll is situated north of and along Highway 401. Oxford County Road 119 (formerly Ontario Highway 19) runs north diagonally through the town. A Canadian National rail line bisects the town east to west through its centre. Passenger service from the Ingersoll train station is provided to other stops in Southwestern Ontario by Via Rail. To the south is a CPR line, with spurs into local industries, which provides freight service to points in the region. The local high school is Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute. The Ingersoll area was first settled in the 1790s by families from New England, became famous for homemade cheese production before the War of 1812,Describing Oxford (Oxford-on-the-Thames) township in a book written in 1812, author Michael Smith, a Methodist missionary, summed it up: \\"This township lies west of Blenheim and Burford, is rich, well watered, thickly timbered, settled and well improved by industrious people, from the states of New York and Vermont. The people in this town are famous for making butter and cheese.\\" Geographical View of the Province of Upper Canada (New York, 1813) and its surrounding County of Oxford was home to the first cheese factories in Canada, starting in 1864. In 1866, through collaboration by the town's businessmen, a giant wheel of cheese weighing was produced at the James Harris Cheese Factory just south of Ingersoll, for promotion of the area's cheese industry. The \\"Mammoth Cheese\\" was exhibited at the New York State Fair in Saratoga, NY, and then in England.Heather Menzies, By the Labour of their Hands, the Story of Ontario Cheddar Cheese (Kingston, 1994), 26‚Äì38. It was a Eureka! accomplishment applauded by the whole country, and in 1867 the Canadian Dairymen's Association was established in Ingersoll, attended by nearly two hundred dairymen from across Canada, followed by annual conventions long thereafter. A booming cheese export industry in the millions of pounds grew from Ingersoll to many parts of the world, and the town's name became synonymous with quality products.A 25-year retrospective of all these developments is contained in the Dept. of Agriculture's Annual Reports of the Dairymen's Associations (Toronto, 1892), available online. The Canadian Museum of History provides a comprehensive 'virtual museum' online titled Ingersoll's Mammoth Cheese and the History of Cheese Making in Oxford County (link deleted by Wiki editor) CAMI Automotive is the largest industrial company in Ingersoll today. Ingersoll also developed as an industrial centre. During the late 19th century, the town's largest industries were Noxon Bros., a manufacturer of farm implements (1856-1916) and the Ingersoll Packing Co., a cheese-exporting and pork-packing firm (1880-1920s). The Noxons' firm was shuttered in 1916, but other large industries took root during the early 20th century, including the St. Charles Condensing Co. (later Borden's Condensed Milk), the Morrow Screw & Nut Co., the Ingersoll Machine and Tool Co., and the Ingersoll Cream Cheese Company.a photo and text compendium of Ingersoll's industrial history can be found on the website Ingersoll Historical Photo Gallery created by the Ingersoll Public Library; for summary see In the 21st century heavy manufacturing is Ingersoll's largest industry, including CAMI Automotive, a General Motors car manufacturing plant, originally a joint venture established in 1986 with Suzuki Motors of Canada, that has produced millions of vehicles. Ingersoll is twinned with Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Early history Portion of Thomas Ingersoll sculpture at Town Hall Ingersoll from the sky - a forested community amidst the farming area it serves - GM plant to the left, old Hwy 19 running north into town on right, water tower in centre, village of Salford in foreground Ingersoll's founder, Thomas Ingersoll (1749‚Äì1812), was a native of Westfield, Massachusetts who moved to Great Barrington, Massachusetts in the early 1770s, and then to Queenston in the Niagara District, Upper Canada in 1795, where he operated an inn while organizing his grand venture to create a new settlement deep in the Upper Canadian wilderness. In 1793 he and associates had received grant of Oxford township, which became the site of the community of Oxford-on-the-Thames, and where he opened roads, established a farm for his family and settled dozens of other families on their own farms nearby. Further rights to the township were revoked in 1798, and Ingersoll's own grant was limited to 1200 acres (486 ha). Discouraged by this and the resulting slow pace of the settlement, Thomas withdrew his family from Oxford in 1806 and took up operation of a government- owned inn and ferry at Port Credit, but after his death the family decided to return to the Oxford homestead, at first Thomas Jr. (1796-1847) with James (1801-1886) in 1818, then his widow Sarah and his other children in 1821 along with eldest son Charles (1791-1832) and Charles' wife and children. Together Thomas Ingersoll's four sons laid the foundations for the hamlet of Ingersoll. Thomas's eldest daughter, Laura Secord (1775-1868), who had married in 1797, had distinguished herself as a heroine of the War of 1812, and remained with her husband and children in Queenston. The hamlet of Ingersoll was proclaimed a village in 1852 and a town in 1865. Whereas Woodstock, the County seat, was Oxford County's administrative centre, Ingersoll became the county's principal industrial centre, in 1871 home to all four of the County's industries that had 50 or more hands. Noxon Brothers and the Eastwood foundry, both manufacturers of agricultural implements, employed 103 and 70 hands respectively. With 4,022 in population in 1871, Ingersoll's population surpassed that of Woodstock (3,982), although its advantage was not to last. By the 1860s, dairying was an emerging industry, sparked farm-wife production of cheese and butter, and then by the introduction of the factory system of cheese production in 1864. In 1866, to promote Ingersoll cheese as a high- quality, standardized brand, a cheese producer, James Harris, and local businessmen produced a 7,300-pound mammoth cheese, exhibited it at the New York State Fair in Saratoga, N.Y., and then exported it to England.James Sinclair, A History of the Town of Ingersoll (Ingersoll, 1924);  Annual town events  Downtown business area along Thames, King and Oxford streets in Ingersoll, Ontario.

Ingersoll was home to the fall fair of the Ingersoll, North and West Oxford Agricultural Society (founded 1847) for more than a century. In 1967 it was succeeded by the Ingersoll Cheese and Wine Festival, which continued for two decades, featuring a variety of events, zaniest of which was the Mayors' Grape Stomp contest, in which the mayors from other communities, appearing in a boxing ring at the town's arena in front of cheering crowds, competed with Ingersoll's mayor to stomp the greatest quantity of juice from each one's bathtub full of grapes. From this later came Harvest Fest, a multi-day event which has now been divided into Harvest Fest, Pumpkin Fest and Kiwanis Rural Urban Dinner Night events. In 1999 a free folk festival was launched which continues each July as the Canterbury Folk Festival. For a number of years there was a Ribfest and an arts program known as the Halls Creek Festival. The year ends off with Santa's Village weekends and parade and Winter Lights Festival.

The museum showcases the town's unique history. The Sports Hall of Fame showcases the town's athletic history. \\"Path of the Giants\\" ‚Äì a 20-foot (6 m) \\"fully round\\" wood carved scene by the late Wilson Johnston, depicting the pioneer trek of his ancestors, the \\"Dunkards\\" from Lancaster, Pennsylvania to Cambridge, Ontario in the 1700s. The agricultural barns were built from lumber and timbers taken from barns found in Oxford County. Reg Knox was the construction manager for this project. It required the barn board and beams to be reclaimed from three existing barn buildings in the area. The buildings were disassembled by Reg and his crew and materials transported to the site where these building now stand. Construction was done by hand like the original process. No power tools were used in the construction of these buildings. Reg worked from a single photograph of the original Old Ingersoll Cheese Factory. The buildings were completed within 3 months by a crew of approximately 6 people from the Ingersoll area. = Ingersoll Creative Arts Centre = Started in 1972, this active arts centre features an exhibit gallery as well as offering classes in a variety of arts and crafts in pottery, painting and fibre arts studios. This arts centre is located at 125 Centennial Lane. = Ingersoll Public Library = A branch of the Oxford County Library. It is located in the Ingersoll Municipal Building. War Memorial and Honour Roll are located on the south side of the Town Centre. In the lobby are a statue and plaque to honour Thomas Ingersoll, the founder of Ingersoll. The former library was a Carnegie library located near the corner of Thames and Charles Streets. = Ingersoll Theatre of Performing Arts = Several amateur productions are presented each year by ITOPA in the former Park Place Theatre, the town's second cinema, which has received several upgrades since 2011 to help improve the experience of its patrons. = Media = The young village's first newspaper was the Ingersoll Chronicle, begun as a weekly in 1853 and operating as both a weekly and daily starting in the 1890s, by which time it was the second-largest in the county. It ceased publication in 1919 and its offices became the Ingersoll branch of the Woodstock Sentinel-Review, the county's largest and only other daily newspaper. Starting from the 1860s, Ingersoll always had more than one newspaper published in town, sometimes several. The longest-running was the Oxford Tribune, later renamed the Ingersoll Tribune, which published as a weekly from the 1870s to the 1970s. It succumbed to competition from the Ingersoll Times, a weekly which operated for nearly fifty years before ceasing publication in 2018. A complete archive of bound volumes of the Ingersoll Chronicle which was being housed in the lower level of the Carnegie Library building was destroyed by flooding in 1976. An online archive of the Ingersoll Times spanning the internet era disappeared when its website was shut down by the newspaper's owner, Sun Media, soon after print publication ceased. As of 2018, Ingersoll is served with a monthly public announcements newsletter published in Thamesford, the Village Voice page.Elsie Sumner, Newspapers of Oxford County (1940) Social, Sports and Music Groups website links: * Ingersoll and District Historical Society * Ingersoll and District Horticultural Society * Ingersoll Basketball Association * Ingersoll Brownies, Sparks, Pathfinders and Guides * Ingersoll Choral Society * Ingersoll Coin Club * Ingersoll Cubs, Scouts and Beavers * Ingersoll District Chamber of Commerce * Ingersoll District Curling Club * Ingersoll District Minor Hockey Association * Ingersoll District Nature Club * Ingersoll Golf Leagues * Ingersoll Ministerial Association, Ingersoll and District Inter-Church Committee * Ingersoll Minor Baseball Association * Ingersoll NBC Hockey League * Ingersoll Pipe Band * Ingersoll Safe Cycling Committee * Ingersoll Skating Club * Ingersoll Slo-Pitch Leagues * Ingersoll Soccer Club * Ingersoll Speed Sharks Swimming Team * Kiwanis Club * Knights of Columbus * Lions Club * Masonic Temple - King Hiram Lodge, St Johns Lodge, Oxford Harris Chapter Royal Arch Lodge * Rotary Club * Royal Canadian Legion Branch 119 Transportation Ingersoll is served by Via Rail Canada at Ingersoll station on the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor.

Sports and Recreation Facilities The town of Ingersoll maintains more than 20 parks with various playgrounds, baseball diamonds, basketball courts and tennis courts as well as several nature trails. It also has several indoor facilities. = Ingersoll District Memorial Centre = For nearly sixty years the home of hockey and large-gathering indoor events in Ingersoll, this facility has a regulation-size rink, change rooms, shops, and an upstairs auditorium. The boys hockey and girls hockey leagues use the largest blocks of available ice time and also make use of available time at the arena buildings in nearby Thamesford and Embro. Planning is underway in Ingersoll for a new facility which eventually will have two rinks, an upper level walking track, and an indoor basketball court. = Victoria Park Community Centre = Ingersoll displays its spirit of renaissance with construction of this indoor pool and fitness complex at Victoria Park, a rebuild and renovation of the original pool built in the 1940s from public donations. The town publishes a full range of aquatics and fitness programs based at this facility. = Ingersoll Seniors Resource Centre = Operating from a former residential and recreation complex built for Suzuki employees involved in management in the early years at the CAMI auto plant, the Seniors Resource Centre provides support services for senior citizens. Demographics Education Public education is managed by the Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB), who oversee three elementary schools; (Harrisfield Public School (formerly Harris Heights Public School), Royal Roads Public School (formerly Princess Anne Public School)Skiing accident claims Ingersoll teen. Woodstock Sentinel Review (2012-02-22). Retrieved on 2013-10-05. and Laurie Hawkins Public School. The TVDSB also manages Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute. The current building for IDCI opened in 1954. It replaced the older, smaller building of the Ingersoll Collegiate. As a district school, it draws students from outlying rural and village communities, transported into Ingersoll by school bus. Catholic education is under the administration of the London District Catholic School Board, who manage one elementary school in Ingersoll; St. Jude's Catholic School. = Historical schools = * Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute: The initial section of the current building was constructed in 1953, and large extensions were added in the 1960s and the 1970s, raising its capacity to serve more than a thousand students drawn by bus from a large radius inside and outside town. The original school from the 1870s was demolished in 1954. A cairn and plaque mark its original location in the front parking lot. The gymnasium building from the original school was saved and moved to a site on Kensington Avenue where it became the Peoples Revival Centre. It was demolished in 2015 to make way for eight new houses. * Princess Elizabeth Public School: It originally opened in the same year as Canada's Confederation ‚Äì 1867. The current building includes the one that opened as a replacement in 1909. This school was closed and was taken over by Vedic Institute of Canada in May, 2014. * Victory Memorial Public School: Built in 1920, Victory Memorial School was named in honour of Canada's participation and victory in the First World War. It replaced Central Public School, built in 1850.Ingersoll Chronicle, Dec. 16, 1915. The property had served as the site of Ingersoll's first school starting in the 1820s. Victory Memorial was closed in 2015, and the building has been repurposed as a seniors residence. The two cannons mounted in front were a gift to the town from the federal government in the early 1900s. They were cast in England and date from the War of 1812.  Social Issues  =Ingersoll Train Station= Ingersoll has been losing its historic landmarks to the process of 'demolition by neglect'. The proud old 19th century CN passenger station in the middle of town has deteriorated to the verge of collapse. =Carmeuse Environmental Issues/Walker Megadump= Residents of Ingersoll and surrounding area have been in a militant state of opposition since the announcement in 2012 that the international conglomerate Carmeuse intends to give a 20-year lease to Walker Industries to operate a megadump taking in garbage from Toronto and London to fill the spent portion of the limestone quarry operated by Carmeuse on nearly 2,000 acres (809 ha) stretching east and north from Ingersoll's eastern boundary. Walker has referenced plans to use the quarry site for a multi-use 'campus' for garbage and recycling operations. Carmeuse has also announced plans to switch to burning garbage in its kilns, which must be heated to 1,000 ¬∞C to process limestone into industrial lime. As a preliminary step, it will conduct a pilot Alternative Low-Carbon Fuels (‚ÄúALCF‚Äù) project to assess pollution levels that result from burning 'engineered' garbage to be trucked in from New York state. Longterm, ALCF garbage to be burned would include non-recyclable paper and plastic packaging materials, cardboard/paper sludge, non-recyclable rubber and plastic from automotive manufacturing, nylon tire fluff/belting, waste materials from diaper manufacturers, and wood refuse. This could also include farm waste. The impact of all this on quality of life for the surrounding human population will be immense, and could continue for centuries.  Historical figures  * Thomas Ingersoll (1749‚Äì1812) b. Westfield, Mass,. removed to Great Barrington, Berkshire County, Mass. in the early 1770s where his uncles were already prominent citizens, and then to Queenston, Niagara District, Upper Canada in 1795. While in Great Barrington he married three times, was involved in a number of businesses including partnership in a mill, joined the Episcopal (Anglican) church, and rose through the ranks of the local militia, achieving the rank of Major. With associates from Berkshire County he received grant of Oxford-on-the-Thames township in Upper Canada in 1793, and from his new base as an innkeeper at Queenston devoted his energy and resources for the next five years to opening the Oxford wilderness for dozens of families to settle there. Started his own farm within the settlement on land along the creek best suited to a millsite, which became the site of the modern town of Ingersoll. His township rights were revoked in 1798 and reduced to a grant of 1200 acres (486 ha). Discouraged, he ceased his promotion of settlement in Oxford in 1806, moved the family and launched a new career as the government innkeeper and ferryman at Port Credit, but his sons returned to the family homestead in Oxford starting in 1818 and laid the foundations for the hamlet of Ingersoll. * Laura Ingersoll Secord (1775‚Äì1868). Daughter of Thomas Ingersoll and wife of James Secord, who served in the militia under Isaac Brock. The couple lived in St. Davids (now Queenston) where American troops stopped at their home seeking supplies during the War of 1812. On June 21, 1813, Laura Secord overheard plans of a surprise attack on British Troops led by Lt. James Fitzgibbon at Beaver Dams. Secord was responsible for walking 20 miles (32 km) through the woods, in newly controlled American territory in the Niagara Peninsula, to Beaver Dams to warn the British. As a result of this information Lt. Fitzgibbon's small British troop and a larger contingent of allied Mohawk warriors were able to intercept and defeat the attack. Although not initially recognized for her role, Lt. James Fitzgibbon later certified that the informant was Laura Secord. Secord's story has often been embellished over the years but her role in Canadian history has since been established by various historians. Secord was never a resident of Oxford County, and possibly never visited Ingersoll, although she and her kin were highly mobile. On hearing her father had suffered a massive stroke in early 1812, she hurriedly made the 60-mile (96 km) journey to Port Credit and arrived the day before his death.Hemmings, David F. Laura Ingersoll Secord, a Heroine and Her Family (Niagara, 2010) p. 7 In the fall of 1818, her home in Queenston became the focus of many family gatherings as Thomas Ingersoll's brother-in-law John Whiting visited from Great Barrington, Massachusetts, travelled to Port Credit to visit his sister Sarah (Thomas Ingersoll's widow), and took Sarah back with him to Great Barrington for further family reunions (it is believed that her son Charles Ingersoll went to Great Barrington in early 1819 to accompany his mother back to Canada, while sons Thomas Ingersoll Jr. and James Ingersoll were busy rebuilding the family farm in Oxford).Currie, Emma. The Story of Laura Secord and Canadian Reminiscences (second edition, Toronto, 1913) * Hall, Canfield, Whiting, Carroll and Harris families. On the departure of Thomas Ingersoll and family from the Oxford settlement in 1806, leadership passed to the other New England families he had encouraged to settle near him within what became the first town boundaries (roughly Harris Street in the east to Whiting Street in the west). Command of the neighbourhood within the Oxford Militia passed to Captain Ichabod Hall (1774-1814), who with brother Samuel had come with Ingersoll from the Great Barrington area in 1797. Ichabod was also W.M. of the Masonic Lodge in the settlement at the time of his death, which came two weeks after his involvement in a skirmish between Upper Canada militia and American raiders in what is now London, Ontario.Your Village News, LONDON BECAME BATTLEFIELD DURING WAR OF 1812 By John M. Milner Ichabod's son Elisha Hall (1800-1868) eventually took over the family farm, which included the land which is now Centennial Park and Victoria Park. Ichabod's daughter Clarissa (1803-1884) married Daniel Carroll (1805-1873), and their son Dr. D.W. Carroll (1838-1912) made creation of Memorial Park possible. The remains of Charles Ingersoll's headstone, relocated to the vestibule of St James Anglican Church in 1948 with permission from Ingersoll's descendants * Charles Ingersoll (1791‚Äì1832), Thomas Ingersoll Jr. (1796-1847), James Ingersoll (1801‚Äì1886) and Samuel Ingersoll (1806-1861). Sons of Thomas Ingersoll. Thomas Jr. and James were the first to return in 1818, constructing a mill pond, spillway, and raceway to drive a sawmill, which was put into operation for the first time in April 1819, lumber from which was then used to build a new family home. Charles was a comrade-in-arms, business partner and brother-in-law of William Hamilton Merritt, the St. Catharines merchant, miller, canal promoter, Tory politician, and Charles's financial backer. Charles was MP for the Oxford riding 1824‚Äì28 and 1830‚Äì32. Died of cholera in 1832. During the 1820s, the Ingersoll brothers established businesses ‚Äì a grist mill, a store, a distillery, and an ashery ‚Äì which became the nucleus for the hamlet of Ingersoll (a village 1852 and a town, 1865). James was appointed county land registrar in 1835, which eventually necessitated his move to Woodstock when it became the county seat in the 1840s. Thomas Jr. and Samuel were invited by the Canada Company in 1839 to build the first mills in Blanshard Township at St. Marys, and they again became town founders there. Hotel 'omnibuses' awaiting passenger train in Ingersoll c. 1900, on the railway line for which planning began in the 1830s * McNab, Crotty, Carnegie, Holcroft and Rothwell families. By the start of the 1830s the hamlet had extended beyond the Ingersoll family ventures clustered around their millpond, and families from Ireland, Scotland and England were setting down roots, particularly on the vacant land north of it, which had remained dormant in the hands of speculators until then. Between them, Crotty (from Ireland, 1831), Carnegie (Scotland, 1834) and Rothwell (Ireland, 1834) became the owners of most of it. McNab, from Scotland via Ireland, probably came with or around the same time as Crotty. McNab and wife fell victim to the same cholera epidemic that took Charles Ingersoll in 1832. James Ingersoll became guardian of the five orphaned McNab children. Holcroft, from England, had commanded the Royal Artillery regiment in Upper Canada during the War of 1812, and became owner of large blocks of land including what is now the Ingersoll golf course. These families soon joined in collaboration with the Ingersolls and others to steer projects to improve the community. Crotty in particular led the effort in the 1840s to ensure the area's first railway would be built through the centre of the growing village rather than bypassing it.James Sinclair, A History of the Town of Ingersoll (1924) Charles.

Owner of the factory in which was built Ingersoll's famous Mammoth Cheese, 7,300 pounds, in 1866. Sponsorship of the venture came from a newly formed private corporation, the Ingersoll Cheese Company, whose shareholders included Harris, farmers who supplied the milk and expertise for construction of the mammoth, and businessmen. The cheese was exhibited at the New York State Fair at Saratoga in 1866, and then exported to England. * Adam Oliver (1823‚Äì1882). Born Scotch Lake settlement, near Fredericton, NB in 1823. Moved with his family to Middlesex County, Upper Canada, in 1819. Moved to nearby Ingersoll, 1850. There he established himself as a lumberman, mill owner, contractor, and politician.

James Noxon House, after it was acquired by the town for its hospital * James Noxon (1833‚Äì1906). Born Bloomfield, Prince Edward County, Upper Canada. Moved to Ingersoll, Canada West, 1856. With his brothers and his father's financial backing, he established one of the largest manufactory of agricultural implements in the province (Noxon Company Ltd.) and the chief industry in Ingersoll. In 1878 he built a mansion which was later to become the town's Alexandra hospital (1909). Mayor of Ingersoll, 1884‚Äì85 and 1887. As president of the firm and its largest shareholder, James lived beyond his means, running up credit and draining the company's resources to pay the bank interest. To save the firm, his brothers ousted him in 1887. He removed to Woodstock to become plant manager of Patterson & Brother, an agricultural implements firm (1887‚Äì1891) and then to Toronto, to serve as provincial Inspector of Prisons and Charities (1891‚Äì1905). Meanwhile, in Ingersoll, the Noxon Company's Noxon-family ownership ended in 1898, the company lost its prominence of early years, and the company was shuttered in 1916. * James McIntyre (1828-1906). Born in Scotland, moved to Canada 1841, and to Ingersoll, 1854. Cabinetmaker and undertaker, proprietor of furniture factory.

Robert's extended family of origin comprised three Stuart brothers who emigrated to Canada from Banffshire, Scotland, and had businesses in Ingersoll John, a miller (1825‚Äì1899), Peter, a miller (1827‚Äì98), and Robert, a grocer (1834‚Äì1913). Robert's father, John Stuart, operated mills in Embro and Ayr during the early 1850s. In 1858 he bought Elisha Hall's sawmill in Ingersoll, which he converted into an oatmeal mill (named North Star Oatmeal Mills). In 1873 John sold North Star Oatmeal Mills to his brother, Peter; moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with his son, Robert; and opened a second North Star Oatmeal Mills in Cedar Rapids. In 1874 John and Robert entered into partnership with a railroader, George Douglas Sr., of Cedar Rapids. In 1876 Robert married Maggie Shearer, a niece of George Douglas. In 1877 Robert Stuart & George Douglas of Cedar Rapids Iowa became co-partners with the father, John Stuart, and an Ingersoll miller, W.S. King, in founding new steam mill in Ingersoll, on north side of the River Thames. The father and son team, John and Robert, later opened a second mill in Chicago. There in 1899 Robert became a co-founder of the American Cereal Company, which was renamed the Quaker Oats Company in 1901. Robert's progeny did well with that company. His son, Robert Douglas Stuart (1886‚Äì1975), became CEO of Quaker Oats in 1922 and served as United States ambassador to Canada from 1953 to 1956. His grandson, Robert Douglas Stuart Jr. (1916‚Äì2014), was CEO of Quaker Oats from 1966 to 1981 and served as United States Ambassador to Norway from 1984 to 1989.  Historical landmarks  Demolished May 2017 Elisha Hall house in the Rebellion era = Elisha Hall House = The first constructed of brick in the hamlet of Ingersoll in the 1830s and the centrepiece of a large property near to what is now Royal Roads Public School (210 King Street East), this was the home of Elisha Hall (1800-1868), rival to James Ingersoll for title of first child born in village, farmer and sawmill owner, local rebel leader in the Rebellion of 1837, confidant of William Lyon Mackenzie during his exile, W.M. of local Masonic lodge, advocate for emancipation of slaves and fair treatment of local black community, and figurehead of the Reform party in Oxford for the remainder of his years. His house was demolished in 2017 without public comment, a sad example of the lack of protection for heritage properties in Ingersoll. = Rothwell House, 1835 = Rothwell House, 1835 and commemorative stone Located on Cemetery Lane, this was the home of Rev. John Rothwell and family, and is one of the few heritage properties for which documentation survives describing its construction, being letters written at the time to family back in Ireland by Rothwell's wife.Ingersoll Cheese and Agriculture Museum, Rothwell file The Rothwells were landholders in County Meath, north of Dublin, and it may have been their promise of employment for tradesmen to construct their home which drew Edward Comiskey, a carpenter from their hometown who later had a hand in the construction of the first St. James Anglican Church. = Elm Hurst = Now the hub of the Elm Hurst Inn and Spa (Harris Street at 401), this was the home of James Harris (1824-1885), who operated the Maple Leaf Cheese Factory on the same property, where the world-famous Mammoth Cheese was manufactured in 1866. 1862 ad for Christopher Brothers, master builders during Ingersoll's boomtown years = Christopher Brothers Residences = Building contractors and operators of a steam saw mill and lumber export business in Ingersoll's boom years in the 1860s and 1870s, the four Christopher brothers built palatial residences for themselves, each distinguished with a central tower. Two still stand - one serves as the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 119 (211 Thames Street North) and the other as Oxford Manor (276 Oxford Street). The two which have been lost to the wrecker's hammer were nearby the Legion property on Thames Street North. = Norsworthy House = Norsworthy House (250 King St. E.) was home to the family of James Counter Norsworthy (1846‚Äì1936). James, native of Devonshire, England, had moved to the Thamesford area in 1852, entered the insurance business, and in 1876 removed to Ingersoll, where he became an inspector for the North British Mercantile Insurance Co. Norsworthy acquired his house in 1878, as part of a dowry from his marriage to Mary Jane Cuthbert (1853‚Äì91). James had four sons and a daughter by his first wife, Mary Jane. After her death in 1891, at the age of 38, he remarried to Mrs. John T. MacDonald of Sarnia in 1895. Today, the Norsworthy family is known for its family home, a stately Victorian mansion. styled \\"Norleigh.\\" James enlarged the house to add an office and a separate entrance for clients and a large front porch; and he added ornate features such as stained glass windows and finely-carved fireplaces, and an upper-story tank to supply the house with water in a gravity system. The family is remembered for its outstanding contribution to Canada's war effort during the First World War. All four Norsworthy sons enlisted as officers, and two of them, Edward and Fred, were killed in action. After the loss of his sons, J.C. Norsworthy became an expert historian on the war and travelled extensively to speak on the subject. The house is rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of Norsworthy's first wife, Mary Jane, who died in 1891 after nursing her children back to health from diphtherias. Perhaps the ghostly Mary Jane's target was the second wife, the replacement mother for her children. That said, the current owners have never seen the Lady in Grey or anything else that could be considered ghostly. Neither have any of the guests who have stayed with them through the bed and breakfast they operate.Ingersoll Tribune, 12 November 1936;Ingersoll Times, 28 October 2006, article by John Tapley  Natural areas and parks  = Victoria Park = Ingersoll's first park, established in 1869. It was known as the Town Park until 1882 when, on the occasion of the town's Queen's Birthday Celebration, it was named Victoria. This park lies adjacent to Centennial Park and is home to the Victoria Park Community Recreation Centre. = Soldiers' Carroll Memorial Park = Ingersoll's second oldest park and, unlike Victoria Park, located near the centre of the town (north of Canterbury Street and east of Thames Street). Formerly the site of Partlo's mill pond. The town established Soldiers' Carroll Memorial Park in 1919, using a bequest from Dr. D.W. Carroll (1838‚Äì1912), by purchasing and draining of Partlo's mill pond. Hall's Creek, which formerly flowed into the pond, continued, butits course was changed and widened; rustic bridges were erected and other improvements made, including the installation of a swimming pool for children.Toronto Globe, 17 December 1920, p. 6. Also about 1920, the Lady Dufferin Chapter, Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire, erected a Park Cenotaph to honour Ingersoll men who gave their lives and served the Empire in two World Wars and the Korean War. Thus, many townspeople have referred to Carroll's Park as Memorial Park. In 2006 a Town by-law renamed Memorial Park honour of Yvonne Holmes Mott (1934-2005) for \\"outstanding contributions to the Town and its people over her lifetime.\\" Each July the Park serves as the main venue for the annual Canterbury Folk Festival, with the main stages, seating area, beverage tents, and craft vendors located there. = Centennial Park = This eight-acre park was created as a Canada Centennial project in 1967. The Ingersoll Cheese Factory Museum and the Creative Arts Centre are located at the upstream end of the former Stuart's Millpond (1822-1909). Centennial is a long and narrow, grass-lined park with a variety of young and older trees. There is a small cheese-themed playground with benches and a walking bridge over a small babbling brook. The playground and benches are constructed of natural wood and bright yellow 'cheese slices'. The backs of the benches look like pieces of Swiss Cheese with the requisite holes. Camping is allowed in the summer with basic toilet facilities at a cost of $15.00 per night. In the winter, there is a charming display of lights that runs the length of the park from the entrance on Harris Street to the exit on Wellington Street. = John Lawson Park and Trail = Located along the south bank of the Thames River, this park contains walking trails in a natural area. Accessed from Charles St. West, at the bottom of Wonham St. South. = Smith's Pond Park = This park is a natural area with walking trails, tall grass, and an annual fishing derby. Its location on the south side of Canterbury Street is the former site of Smith's mill pond. This pond vanished on 5 March 1976 when its swollen waters broke through the embankment supporting Smith's dam. The park was established in 2000. The park includes the ruins of the old cement dam and a new, much smaller pond, created by splitting the flow of Hall's Creek. One fork of the creek runs through the pond, the other fork alongside it. = 19th-century millponds = Early mills required water power, which was obtained by damming steams to create millponds and mill races. Thus, Ingersoll's first pond most likely dated from the years 1818-1819, when Thomas Ingersoll Jr. and James Ingersoll built a saw mill on the family farm, fulfilling their father's vision when he chose the site for his family in 1793. Construction of a dam, spillway, raceway and millwheel machinery and structures was a complex process, but the saw mill was finally put into operation by April 1819. This was followed by construction of a grist mill as the family ventures grew. By the 1850s Ingersoll had five ponds whose mill races delivered power to grist mills, flour mills, saw mills and a woollen mill. All five ponds were located south of the River Thames, four of them using water from two north-flowing tributaries of the Thames River and one using water from the Thames itself. Three mill ponds were located along Hall's Creek,For the name, Hall's Creek, see Tremaine's 1857 map of Oxford County. which flowed swiftly northward from Elisha Hall's farm: Hall's Pond (later Stuart's Pond), Smith's Pond,named for James Smith (1825‚Äì1920), miller. Directory of Oxford County, 1857‚Äì58; manuscript census for Ingersoll, 1871; Death Registration, Ingersoll, 1920. and Smith's \\"lower pond\\" (later Partlo's Pond).named for William Partlo, miller on Mill Street. See Town of Ingersoll Directory, 1894‚Äì95. Manuscript Censuses for Ingersoll, 1881, 1891. In time, Partlo's Pond was drained to create Dr. Carroll's Park (Memorial Park). To the west was Benson's Pond (later King's Pond) on Whiting Creek.For the name, Whiting Creek, see Tremaine's 1857 map of Oxford County. The owner of the Whiting-Creek dam was James Rea Benson, possibly in partnership with Thomas Rodman Merritt. Both were businessmen and sometime partners in St. Catharines, with connections to Ingersoll. Benson‚Äôs wife was a daughter of Charles Ingersoll. In September, 1857, Benson and Merritt sold 150 Ingersoll lots by auction. Benson Street and Merritt Street lie on either side of the mill pond. See Wikipedia, James Rea Benson (180785); Directory of Oxford County 1857‚Äì58; Ingersoll Chronicle 18 September 1857. Lastly, there was Carroll's pond, just south of the River Thames.Pond named for Daniel Carroll, land owner and miller (1795‚Äì1878). Shenston‚Äôs Gazetteer. Doug Palmer, \\"Daniel Carroll,\\" in Retrospect, Official Bulletin of the Ingersoll & District Historical Society, Vol 1, No.3, November, 1994, 40‚Äì41; Manuscript Census for Ingersoll, 1852; Directory of Oxford County, 1857‚Äì58; Chronicle Feb 12, 1873 To make this pond, Daniel Carroll diverted water from the west-flowing Thames to create an artificial, west-flowing creek; then he damned the creek to create the pond and mill race, which delivered power to two grist mills; the outflow of water from these mills returned the creek water to the River Thames.The last of the ponds, Smith's Pond, came to an end in 1976. The advent of steam power in the 1850s freed industries from dependence on water power and proximity to mill ponds. This allowed new industries to locate on the north side of the Thames and other hitherto neglected places.Tremaine's Map of Oxford County, 1857;Historical Map of Oxford County, 1876; Bird's-Eye Map of Ingersoll, 1887; J.C.

Historical churches  Nathan Bangs, Methodist missionary who claimed the Ingersolls as converts in 1801Abel Stevens, Life and times of Nathan Bangs, D.D. (New York, 1863) From the earliest days, the people of the Oxford settlement were drawn to evangelicals and evangelism. The families brought in by Thomas Ingersoll were active in an era when Puritanism (Congregational Church) was still the official religion in most of New England, and a great many could not abide the extreme self-denial preached by such men as the pastor at Great Barrington, one of many who have been described by historians as \\"Puritans gone haywire\\".The American Historical Review, Volume 87, Issue 3, 1 June 1982, Pages 846‚Äì847 The Anglican, Methodist and Baptist forms of worship had become popular alternatives. Thomas Ingersoll's associate, Rev. Gideon Bostwick was so popular that the people of Great Barrington refused to make any further payments to support the Congregational pastor, although required by law. Bostwick's missionary circuit from Great Barrington grew to include parts of Vermont, Connecticut, New York state, and the whole western end of Massachusetts.L.H. Sahler, THE EARLIEST RECORDS OF SAINT JAMES EPISCOPAL CHURCH, GREAT BARRINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS (Great Barrington, 1903) In his journeys he preached in the same frontier towns as Baptist and Methodist missionaries. After Bostwick's unexpected death in 1793, at least five Baptist preachers were amongst the Thomas Ingersoll settlers, and Methodist missionaries won the hearts of two of Ingersoll's daughters. All of the churches established in the hamlet of Ingersoll had their origin in such missionary work. As the community grew, it raised its own missionaries who went out into the wider world, including the first mayor's daughter Dr. Belle Chone Oliver, and most famous of all, Aimee Semple McPherson. = First Baptist Church = Without any resident clergy, the Oxford settlement relied on visiting missionaries for spiritual guidance in its earliest years. Amongst the first of these to make the journey were sent by Baptist associations in the state of Vermont, where families such as the Canfields and Burdicks, who were headed by Baptist preachers, had spent time before their move to Canada in the 1790s. Ely Harris and his wife Lucretia Abigail Ransom with their family of three daughters and nine sons, four of whom were Baptist preachers, arrived in the Ingersoll area in 1802.Wikitree, Ely Harris (1755 - 1813) Members of the first Baptist congregations joined in covenants to watch over each other. By the 1850s there were several such separate congregations in the Ingersoll area.Zella Hotson, Pioneer Baptist Work in Oxford County (Woodstock, 1939) A Baptist Meeting House opened \\"on the side of a hill in Albert Street, near the English [Anglican] Church\\" in June, 1858. This came from ongoing efforts to unite the separate congregations, which continued for the next four decades under pastors such as Rev. John Dempsey(1822-1899). A graduate of the first Baptist College in Canada which operated in Montreal in the 1840s, Dempsey was appointed pastor in several communities in Quebec and Ontario (including Ingersoll) during his career, and after retiring to Ingersoll, he continued with efforts to develop a Baptist College in Oxford, at Woodstock (later moved to Toronto, then to Hamilton, as the nucleus of today's McMaster University).E.R. Fitch, The Baptists of Canada; a history of their progress and achievements (Toronto, 1911) The fully united congregation in Ingersoll constructed a red brick church building in 1896, on what is now the northeast corner of Thames Street South and Canterbury Street. This building was destroyed by fire following a lightning strike in 1898, but was immediately re-built on the existing site. It is still an active, community-oriented, Christian Church.Ingersoll Chronicle, 4 June 1858 = British Methodist Episcopal Church = During the 1850s and 1860s a congregation of escaped slaves from the American south grew up in Ingersoll who were served by this church, which owned a building on Catherine Street from about 1860 to 1900. Its most famous pastor was the Rev. Solomon Peter Hale (1815-1903), whose flamboyant sermons drew the attention of newspapers in the area.Joyce A. Pettigrew, A Safe Haven - The Story of the Black Settlers of Oxford County (Otterville, 2006) = Ingersoll Christian Reformed Church = The church's original congregation came from the Netherlands in the mid 1850s. In 1955, a barn was renovated into a church on King Street. In 1973 the barn was sold and later burned in 1975. In 1976, the congregation decided to rebuild on 1.6 ha (4 ac) just west of the first church. = Peoples Revival Centre = In 1942, the congregation bought the collegiate gym and moved the complex to its present location. = Princess Elizabeth Community Centre = In 2012, Princess Elizabeth Public School was purchased by a charity named the Vedic Institute of Canada and has been converted to Vedic Ashram or Retreat Centre. = Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church = The congregation was established in 1838, served by missionaries. The first church, a wooden building, was built on John Street in 1850. It was raised to parish status in 1864. The brick church building on the corner of Thames Street North and Bell Street was built in 1879, and is one of the tallest structures in the town. = Salvation Army = The congregation was established in 1884 and the church was built in 1935. = St. James Anglican Church = Ordination of Gideon Bostwick On granting the township of Oxford-on-the-Thames to Thomas Ingersoll's associates in 1793, Governor Simcoe had hoped the new settlement would be led by the Rev. Gideon Bostwick (1742-1793), who had been ordained by the Bishop of London at St. James Palace in 1770 and by 1793 had a large and well-known missionary circuit extending many miles north, south and east from St. James Episcopal (Anglican) Church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. (He had presided over each of Thomas Ingersoll's marriages there). Bostwick was named first amongst Thomas Ingersoll's associates, and his \\"well known suffering\\" for the church caused Simcoe to note him just the type who should be encouraged to settle here. Bostwick made strenuous preparations for the move but died suddenly from pneumonia before seeing his new home in Upper Canada. His sons and daughters made the move a few years later, and son Henry Bostwick (1782-1816) was appointed by Isaac Brock to command the Oxford Militia in the War of 1812. The Oxford settlement later hamlet of Ingersoll did not have a resident Anglican clergyman until forty years after Gideon's death, although it was included on the Bishop's occasional circuits through the province until then. The congregation was formally established in 1834 with the arrival of Rev. John Rothwell (1797-1866), ordained following his graduation from Trinity College, Dublin. Rather than appointed by the Bishop, Rothwell himself chose the hamlet of Ingersoll as his new home, purchasing farm land for his family and volunteering his services for the first five years without asking compensation, encouraging the congregation to concentrate instead on building a suitable first church for the community, using land donated by the Ingersolls on its highest hill (now the site of the senior citizens apartment building on Earl Street), finally completed and consecrated in 1840.A visitor described the Rothwells' journey this way: \\"When he arrived he found no prospect of employment; and therefore purchased some wild land, and got up a log house, consisting of two rooms, in which himself and Mrs. Rothwell had to live, and in which she had to prepare single-handed the meals for themselves and their work-people; for, at first, owing to the antipathy of the neighbouring Wesleyans and Romanists to the Church, she could get no servant whatever. It may be supposed that a person of good education and some accomplishment, would find this a state of great hardship; but, as she assured me, it turned out much less than she had expected. In time they got a frame house erected: Mr. Rothwell was requested by some church-people to officiate, and by degrees made his way amongst them. After a while he put himself in communication with the bishop, and went on under his sanction; and, subsequently, was placed on the list of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and had a salary assigned him. Now they have a good farm around them, another inferior one in the hands of a tenant, and a very respectable little church.\\" Beaven, Recreations of a long vacation (1843) The present church building on Oxford Street near the Town Hall was erected in 1868 - contractors were the Christopher Brothers. = St. Paul's Presbyterian Church = The congregation was established in 1846. It was originally named Knox Presbyterian until the union of a number of parishes - Knox, Erskine and St. Andrews - at what became St. Paul's in 1889. A fascinating description (available onlineA BOY‚ÄôS LIFE IN INGERSOLL IN THE 1850s, from Francis Huston Wallace‚Äôs \\"Memories: A Family Record\\" (1922) available on the Oxford County Library website) of the early days of the Knox congregation and the interplay between the Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists and Anglicans in Ingersoll in the 1840s and 1850s was written by the son of the first pastor of Knox Church, Rev. Robert Wallace (1820-1897). The Presbyterian church sometimes drew followers who could not abide the \\"ranters\\" presiding at the other churches. Rev Luke Hitchcock (1813-1898), Methodist Episcopal Church, grandson of Thomas Ingersoll, son of Julius and Myra (Ingersoll) Hitchcock = Trinity United Church = The United Church was formed in 1925 to complete the national movement underway for decades to unite Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches across Canada. The Methodists were originally reformers in the Church of England (Anglican Church) in the 1700s who formed their own church movement when reforms were rejected. The earliest Methodist missionaries to the Oxford settlement came with permission from Thomas Ingersoll, who mourned the loss of Gideon Bostwick's evangelical powers, but saw the need for other forms of spiritual leadership. Two of his daughters eventually married Methodist missionaries. As the hamlet of Ingersoll grew in the 1820s, Methodists used the log schoolhouse on Oxford Street for worship, and shared it with the Anglicans when Rev. John Rothwell arrived in 1834. Two branches of the Methodists developed in the hamlet, each with its own church building by the 1850s (Episcopal Methodists on Charles Street at the foot of Oxford Street, and Wesleyan Methodists on Oxford Street across from the Town Hall). The original \\"Two Tower\\" church on King Street West was built in 1865 for the Wesleyans. With expansions over the years it eventually became the home of both Methodist congregations along with some of the Presbyterians in the town. The three-portal entranceway that was added to it and the name Trinity were symbolic of the union.Descriptions of the early Methodists and the separate churches that grew up in Ingersoll can be found in Industrial Ingersoll Illustrated, 1907, available online.  Sports history  = Baseball = Oscar 'Lefty' Judd (1908-1995) returned to Ingersoll after his pro ball career The New England settlers of Oxford-on-the-Thames brought with them an early version of the stick and ball game now known as baseball. This was played in the Great Barrington area in the 1790s, and was a part of the Queen's Birthday celebrations in pioneer Oxford, as immortalized in the writings of Dr. Ford which gave nearby Beachville its fame as the birthplace of baseball in Canada. By the 1860s a Canadian championship circuit had been developed from Oxford. Ingersoll's team took the title in 1868 and went on to display its prowess in matches against American teams in the 1870s. By the 1930s Ingersoll had a semi-pro team that recruited Oscar 'Lefty' Judd (1908-1995), a phenomenal pitcher from Nissouri township who helped propel the team to the provincial championship before launching his career as a professional player in the United States. = Hockey = The greatest year for organized hockey in Oxford was arguably the 1954-55 season, when Woodstock's Warriors recruited the sensational young Bobby Hull for its Junior B team and went on to win the provincial championship. The energy was infectious. Bobby was known to hang out at the pool hall in downtown Ingersoll and players in town as well as in Tillsonburg got stoked, carrying their own teams to new heights. Ingersoll's Reems captured the Junior C provincial championship that same year, while Tillsonburg topped the Intermediate A ranks. = Cycling = When bicycling exploded in popularity in the 1890s, the sign of prowess was to complete a 'century' during free time on the weekend, meaning completion of at least 100 miles of travel. The town's undisputed all-time great was Doug Carr (1910-1994), who made a round-the-world bicycle tour of over 60,000 miles from 1937 to 1939, followed by a speaking tour celebrating the feat, before settling into his career as a book and china store operator in Ingersoll. The physical artifacts he saved are housed at the Ingersoll Cheese and Agricultural Museum; his diaries, photographs and papers from his years of adventure are at the Ontario Archives. An online archive has been created from a presentation at the HASTAC 2013 conference at York University, Toronto, and numerous other online summaries are available. = School athletics = Through much of the last century the elementary schools in Ingersoll joined each year in presenting a May Festival program of dancing and singing for entertainment of parents at the town arena, and a Field Day program when all the schools paraded to Victoria Park for a day of athletic competitions on the playing fields in front of the covered grandstands. At the high school level, the school boards collaborated in organizing competitions between teams from all the high schools in the county. In 1958 this was expanded to create tri-county athletics championship competitions amongst the high schools of Oxford, Elgin and Norfolk counties, as a preliminary to determining entry in the Western Ontario Secondary School Athletics Association (WOSSAA) championship. When the school boards were merged to form the current Thames Valley District School Board in 1998, the tri-county competition was modified to include Oxford, Elgin and Middlesex as the championship series preliminary to WOSSAA. Ingersoll earned its first tri-county championship in football with a string of IDCI Blue Bombers senior team victories in 1968. The IDCI girls hockey team has reached the WOSSAA championship level three years in a row as of 2018. Rankings, standings and championship holders are all provided on the Thames Valley Regional Athletics website.http://tvraa.com  Plaques and monuments  = The Big Cheese = Located south of Ingersoll, at the Elm Hurst Inn off Road 119; first exit north of Highway 401. This plaque marks the site of James Harris's co-operative cheese factory, in which was constructed a giant 7,300-pound \\"Big Cheese.\\" The mammoth cheddar was made in eight days and cured in three months in a specially built shed. In August, 1866, the \\"Big Cheese\\" was transported on a modified wagon by six horses to the train station in Ingersoll. It was exhibited at the New York State Fair in Saratoga and then shipped to England, where it was bought by a Liverpool merchant. = First cheese factory = Located at the Ingersoll Post Office, a historical plaque commemorates the establishment of the first cheese factory in Canada near the Oxford County village of Norwich in 1864. The rapid, widespread adoption of the co-operative factory system across Ontario marked the beginning of the modern dairy industry in Canada. The Canadian Dairymen's Association was founded in Ingersoll in 1867. = Founders of Ingersoll = Located on the south east corner of the Thames Street bridge. Commemorates Major Thomas Ingersoll and his son Charles who were responsible for the first major settlement of the Townships of East, West and North Oxford and who founded the community of Ingersoll in 1793. = Site of Thomas Ingersoll's log cabin = This plaque, situated on a pavilion, marks the former location of Thomas Ingersoll's log cabin, circa 1795. Located between 131 and 147 Thames Street, Ingersoll. = The old town halls and the present-day one = Ingersoll Town Hall in 2009 The original market house and town hall, constructed of wood in 1853 on the southeast corner of King and Oxford streets, was destroyed by fire in April, 1856. The village council replaced it with a brick building in 1857, at a cost of ¬£2,700, and paid ¬£8 15s to have its image displayed on Tremaine's 1857 Map of Oxford County. The town demolished that building in 1990 and replaced it with the present-day town hall, on the southwest corner of King and Oxford streets. A Saturday-morning farmer's market operates seasonally on the town hall square, situated on original site of the town hall. An historical plaque marking the second building vanished with its demolition. Notable people * Elizabeth 'Betty' Gardner Taylor, (1916‚Äì77), born in Ingersoll.

As a variant of the letter e, it also appears in Acehnese, Afrikaans, Dutch, Filipino, French, Luxembourgish, the Abruzzese dialect of the Neapolitan language, and the Ascolano dialect. The letter is also used in Seneca, Taiwanese Hokkien, Turoyo and Uyghur when written in Latin script. Usage in various languages =Acehnese= In Acehnese, √´ is used to represent (schwa), a mid central vowel. =Afrikaans= In Afrikaans, the trema (Afrikaans: deelteken, ) is mostly used to indicate that the vowel should not be diphthongised, for example ge√´r (\\"giver\\") is pronounced , whilst geer (a wedge-shaped piece of fabric) is pronounced . There are some cases where the deelteken does nothing to the pronunciation, like in re√´n (\\"rain\\"), which is pronounced . The non-existent word *reen would be pronounced the same. The deelteken in this case has only a historical background; the archaic form of re√´n is regen and the deelteken indicates that the g was removed. Some older people still pronounce re√´n in two syllables (). The deelteken does exactly what it says (deelteken being Afrikaans for \\"separation mark\\"). It separates syllables, as it indicates the start of a new one. An example of this is the word vo√´l (\\"bird\\"), which is pronounced in two syllables. Without it, the word would become voel (\\"feel\\"), which is pronounced in one syllable. =Albanian= √ã is the 8th letter of the Albanian alphabet and represents the vowel . It is the most commonly used letter of the language, comprising 10 percent of all writings. =Ascolano= √ã is a phonetic symbol also used in the transcription of Abruzzese dialects and in the Province of Ascoli Piceno (the ascolano dialect). It is called \\"mute E\\" and sounds like a hummed √©. It is important for the prosody of the dialect itself. = Emilian-Romagnol = √ã is used in Romagnol to represent […õÀê~…õ…ô], e.g. frad√´l [fraÀàd…õ…ôl~fraÀàd…õÀêl] \\"brother\\". In some peripheral Emilian dialects, √´ is used to represent […ô], e.g. str√´tt [str…ôtÀê] \\"narrow\\". =English= Use of the character √ã in the English language is relatively rare. Some publications, such as the American magazine The New Yorker, use it more often than others.The New Yorker ‚Äì Style Notation It is used to indicate that the e is to be pronounced separately from the preceding vowel (e.g. in the word \\"re√´ntry\\", the feminine name \\"Chlo√´\\" or in the masculine name \\"Rapha√´l\\"), or at all - like in the name of the Bront√´ sisters, where without diaeresis the final e would be mute. =Filipino= =French and Dutch= √ã appears in words like French No√´l and Dutch koloni√´n. This so-called trema is used to indicate that the vowel should not be monophthonged. For example, No√´l is pronounced , whilst *Noel would be pronounced . Likewise, \\"koloni√´n\\" is pronounced , whilst \\"*kolonien\\" would be pronounced . =Hungarian= √ã does not belong to the official Hungarian alphabet, but is usually applied in folklore notations and sometimes also in stylistic writing, e.g. is extensively used in the vocal oeuvre of Kod√°ly. The reason is that open e (close to English hat, cat, cap) and closed √´ (close to Spanish e) are distinguished in most spoken dialects, but is not indicated in writing because of the history of writing and due to little but observable areal variation. =Kashubian= √ã is the 9th letter of the Kashubian alphabet and represents . =Ladin= Although not used in standard Ladin, √ã is used in some local dialects. It represents . =Latin= In many editions of Latin texts, the diaeresis is used to indicate that ae and oe form a hiatus, not a diphthong (in the Classical pronunciation) or a monophthong (in traditional English pronunciations). Examples: a√´r \\"air\\", po√´ta \\"poet\\", co√´rcere \\"to coerce\\". =Lenape= In the Lenape language, the letter √´ is used to represent the schwa vowel. An example of its use is the word mikw√´n, which means \\"feather\\". It can also be found in more complex words, such as nt√´mp√´m, which means \\"my brain\\". =Luxembourgish= In Luxembourgish, is used for stressed schwa like in the word √´mmer (\\"always\\"). It is also used to indicate a morphological plural ending after two such as in ee√´r (\\"eggs\\") or lee√´n (\\"lay\\"). =Mayan languages= In the modern orthography of Mayan languages, the letter √ã represents . =Russian= In some Latin transliterations of Russian, √´ is used for its homoglyph —ë, representing a , as in Pot√´mkin to render the Cyrillic –ü–æ—Ç—ë–º–∫–∏–Ω. Other translations use yo, jo or (ambiguously) simply e. =Syriac= In the romanization of Syriac, the letter √ã gives a schwa. In some grammatical constructions, it is a replacement for the other, original vowels (a, o, e, i, u). Example words that have √ã: kno·π≠√´r (\\"he is waiting\\"), kr√´h·π≠i (\\"they are running\\"), kr√´qdo (\\"she is dancing\\"), ≈ù√´rla (\\"she has closed\\"), gfol√´·∏• (\\"he will work\\"), mad√´n·∏•o (\\"east\\"), m√´n (\\"what\\"), a≈°√´r (\\"believe\\"). Turoyo and Assyrian languages may utilize this diacritic, albeit rarely. =Seneca= In Seneca, the letter √ã is used to represent , a close- mid front unrounded nasalized vowel. =Tagalog= In Tagalog and its standardized form Filipino, √ã is used to represent the schwa, particularly in words originating from other Philippine languages, for instance Maranao (M√´ranaw), Pangasinan, Ilocano, and Ibaloi. Before introduction of this letter, schwa was ambiguously represented by A or E. =Uyghur= √ã is the 6th letter of the Uyghur Latin alphabet and represents close-mid front unrounded vowel .

History =Formation and Cruz Records years= All formed in suburban Los Angeles in 1987 when Milo Aukerman, the lead singer of the Descendents, left to pursue a graduate degree in biochemistry, forcing the band into a hiatus. The remaining members, guitarist Stephen Egerton, bassist Karl Alvarez, and drummer Bill Stevenson decided to carry on as a band, adopting the title of the Descendents‚Äô last studio album, All, as their official moniker. Enlisting former Dag Nasty and DYS singer Dave Smalley on vocal duties, All released their first two albums in 1988: Allroy Sez and the EP Allroy for Prez (both distributed by Cruz Records) to critical acclaim. In 1989, Smalley left the band, and new vocalist Scott Reynolds joined. With Reynolds, All released four more albums: 1989's Allroy's Revenge (which included the single She's My Ex), 1990's Allroy Saves, 1992's Percolater, and the 1990 live album Trailblazer. Also during this time, the band recorded New Girl, Old Story, an album with former Descendents member Tony Lombardo under the band name Tonyall. The band lived in a small office complex (as referenced in the Scott Reynolds-penned song \\"Box\\"), and toured nearly nonstop. Following a brief stint in rural Brookfield, Missouri, the band eventually relocated to Fort Collins, Colorado: the centrally-located city made touring the west and east coasts of the country considerably easier. Reynolds left the band in 1993, and was replaced by vocalist Chad Price. The album Breaking Things was released in 1993 to generally positive reviews, and the songs Guilty and Shreen were released as singles. =Interscope/Epitaph years= All briefly joined major label Interscope Records for 1995's Pummel, but disputes over marketing and promotion of the album ended their relationship quickly. The song \\"Million Bucks\\" was released as a single and a video, but the album ultimately received rather mixed reviews from fans and critics alike. The band was signed by Epitaph Records shortly after. At this time, Milo Aukerman, now a full-time biochemist, returned to the Descendents and recorded their 1996 comeback album Everything Sucks, also on Epitaph. Stevenson, Alvarez, and Egerton continued to tour and record with both bands, eventually releasing All's critically acclaimed 1998 album Mass Nerder, 2000's Problematic, and the 2001 Descendents/All live split Live Plus One. According to a 2004 interview with Bill Stevenson, All is no longer under contract with Epitaph Records, and any new All material will be released on their own label, Owned & Operated Records =Hiatus= The band has previously talked about having two albums in the works, however there has not been any news on them in some time. One album, which was written and partially recorded in early 2002 while the band was recording the Descendents‚Äô album Cool To Be You, is reported to consist of all new material with the familiar All sound, while the other is planned to be much more experimental, with a heavier emphasis on instrumental compositions. All went through a multi-year period of inactivity, with members working on other projects across the country. Bill Stevenson and Karl Alvarez both live in Fort Collins, Colorado; Stevenson is currently playing with Only Crime and The Lemonheads, and running his own recording studio, The Blasting Room, while Alvarez has contributed bass to The Lemonheads‚Äô 2006 album, Underminer, and has toured with Gogol Bordello. Stephen Egerton currently lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his family, running his own studio, Armstrong Records. Stephen has several music projects in the works. The first, 40Engine, is with former vocalist Scott Reynolds; another is an instrumental band named Slorder, and he also plays bass and drums with a guitarist named Jason Crowley under the name Crowley/Egerton. Chad Price is playing in the Colorado alt-country band Drag the River and tours playing bass for Rocky Votolato. =Reunion= On January 26, 2008, Egerton, Stevenson, and Alvarez reunited with Scott Reynolds to play a set of All songs as an opening act for Drag the River at the Aggie in Fort Collins. In mid-April of that year, the band announced that they would be reuniting once again with Reynolds for Chicago, Illinois's 'Riot Fest' on October 12. They performed at the Congress Theater in Chicago, playing for less than an hour before Chicago police shut down the show. Additionally, All performed two warm up shows; one in Japan in July 2008 and the other at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, on August 29, 2008. The DNC show was cut short and the band completed an additional set that evening at the 3 Kings Tavern in downtown Denver. In July 2009 the band completed a short tour with fellow Cruz Records alums Big Drill Car, going across Southern California. Former Descendents bandmate Tony Lombardo joined the band on stage July 18 and 19 of that tour for two songs, to a very welcoming crowd. In an interview with RiotFest.org, Scott Reynolds does not rule out the possibility of writing new material but sets three conditions that need to be present: People want to hear new music, he feels the need to create, and the \\"bro\\" factor between the bandmates needs to be there. All played a one-off performance in Portland, Oregon, at Dante's on October 3, 2009. In the beginning of 2010, the band was set to perform a short tour on the east coast, with Off with Their Heads and Shot Baker. However, the shows were postponed due to health issues with Bill Stevenson, but they were never rescheduled. At the 2011 punk Rock Bowling, the band played a set with all three of their singers, Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds and Chad Price. From 2011 to 2014 the band played various shows around the U.S. On February 16, 2013, the band performed at The Mohawk in Austin, Texas, as part of a cancer benefit. On July 24, 2014, All played a dual set with both Chad and Scott, followed by A Descendents karaoke part where both Chad and Scott sang songs. Throughout The ' touring cycle from 2016 to 2018, both Chad and Scott have performed songs with the band at various shows. On August 3, 2018, during a show in Buffalo, New York, the band performed two songs after bringing out Scott Reynolds as a special guest. On November 18, 2018, ALL played a show to celebrate The ending their 2018 \\"Tourage\\" where they played a dual set with both Scott and Chad on vocals in Tulsa. Allroy Allroy as drawn by artist Chris SharyAll's mascot is Allroy, a yellow- or green-skinned cartoon character with spiked hair, whorls for eyes, and a large, toothy grin, often depicted engaged in conflict with an anthropomorphic musical note. Allroy was created by bassist Karl Alvarez, based on a caricature he had drawn of guitarist Stephen Egerton for the Descendents' 1987 \\"FinALL\\" tour posters. \\"When they go out on tour, Stephen likes to be the one that drives\\", said artist Chris Shary. \\"Well, he'd been up for a while, just pounding coffee, and Karl was in the back, and Stephen just turned back to look at him and it was this crazed [look], like almost the eyes spinning, and the big grin, and so Karl drew that out and that was the FinALL tour drawing. It just kind of went from there and got tweaked a little bit, and there was Allroy.\\" Meant to be All's equivalent to the Descendents' Milo character, Allroy is \\"representative of all things Allular\\", said Alvarez, adding \\"I swear to God I'd never seen The Simpsons when I drew that design\\", noting the character's resemblance to Bart Simpson (the Simpson family characters debuted April 19, 1987, on The Tracey Ullman Show, while Allroy debuted a year later on the cover of All's debut album Allroy Sez). Allroy is the eponymous character of All's early releases Allroy Sez (1988), Allroy for Prez (1988), Allroy's Revenge (1989), and Allroy Saves (1990), and appears on the covers of these releases in illustrations done by Alvarez. Allroy was absent from the band's cover art for much of the 1990s before being revived for Mass Nerder (1998), as drawn by Chris Shary. Shary also drew Allroy for the cover of the compilation album All (1999), and he and Alvarez together illustrated the character for the cover of Problematic (2000).

Doulos SIL glyphs for Majuscule and minuscule √Æ. French √é is a letter which appears in several French words, like ' (to be born), ' (abyss), ' (master), ' and more. Unlike √Ç, √ä, and √î, the circumflex does not alter the pronunciation of √Æ or √ª. The circumflex usually denotes the exclusion of a letter (usually an s) that was in a prior version of the word: * ' became '. * ' became ' and then '. * ' became ' and then '. The 1990 spelling reforms removed the accents if they are not required to distinguish between homonyms and so ', ', ' and ' no longer take the circumflex. ', however, (meaning 'your one' as a pronoun) uses the circumflex to distinguish it from ' (meaning 'your' as a possessive determiner). Friulian √é is used to get a longer value of I, becoming . It can be found for example in all verbs of the fourth conjugation: ' , (to revel). Another use of √é (and also the other long vowels), is dued to Latin derivation. Instead of preserving the last vowel, in Friulian it was used to give a longer value to the penultimate vowel, ending the word with a consonant: gliru(m) < ', (dormouse), where the ending u disappeared. Italian In Italian the circumflex accent is an optional accent. While the accent itself has many uses, with the letter \\"i\\" it is only used while forming the plural of male nouns ending in ' in order to minimize both ambiguity and the stressing of the wrong syllable: ' (principle) has the plural ' , and ' (prince) has ' as plural. In this situation it can be replaced with a double \\"i\\" (E.g \\"principii\\" ), with an i followed by a j (E.g \\"principij\\"), with a single j (E.g \\"principj\\") or, more simply, with a single \\"i\\" (E.g \\"principi\\"). In contemporary usage is utilized mostly the single \\"i\\" while the other variants are seen as archaic and overly formal. Kurdish √é is the 12th letter of the Kurdish alphabet and represents : ' (, 'Kurdish language'). Romanian √é is the 12th letter of the Romanian alphabet and denotes . This sound is also represented in Romanian as letter √¢. The difference is that √¢ is used in the middle of a word, as in ', but √Æ is used at the beginning or the end of a word: ' (understanding), ' (to hate). A compound word starting with the letter √Æ retains it, even if it is in the middle of the word: ' (misunderstanding). However, if a suffix is added, the √Æ changes into √¢, as in the example: ' (to hate), ' (hated). Turkish In Turkish, √Æ can indicate the sound in Arabic loanwords where it is used as an adjectival suffix that makes an adjective from a noun: asker√Æ (military), mill√Æ (national), d√¢hil√Æ (internal) etc. Welsh In Welsh, √Æ is used to represent long stressed i when, without the circumflex, the vowel would be pronounced as short (' , the mutated form of \\"team\\"), as opposed to ' \\"no, nought, nothing\\".

It was constructed in 1949, by husband-and-wife design pioneers Charles and Ray Eames, to serve as their home and studio. The house is also known as Case Study House No. 8 because it was commissioned by Arts & Architecture magazine as part of a program challenging architects to design progressive, but modest, homes in Southern California.Sarah Amelar (October 5, 2011), Two Eames Grandchildren on Charles and Ray‚Äôs Living Room New York Times. Charles and Ray moved into the home on Christmas Eve in 1949 and never moved out (Charles died in August 1978 and Ray died in August 1988). Charles's daughter, Lucia Eames, inherited the home and created the non-profit organization, the Eames Foundation, in 2004. Still a historic house museum maintained by the Eames Foundation, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006Nancy Kenney (April 15, 2019), The Getty Conservation Institute maps out a plan to preserve the Eames House The Art Newspaper. and serves as a pilgrimage site for nearly 20,000 visitors a year (reservations are required). Design and history Rendering of the residence and studio In the early 1940s, John Entenza, the owner of Arts & Architecture magazine and Case Study Program founder, purchased 5 acres of land on a wooded bluff that was once part of Will Rogers' large estate. He sold 1.4 acres of this land to Charles and Ray in 1945. Their home's design was first sketched out by Charles Eames with fellow architect Eero Saarinen in 1945 as a raised steel and glass box projecting out of the slope and spanning the entrance drive before cantilevering dramatically over the front yard. The structure was to be constructed entirely from \\"off-the-shelf\\" parts available from steel fabricator catalogs. Immediately after the war, though, these parts were in very short supply. By the time the materials arrived three years later, much pre-construction time had been spent picnicking at and exploring the lot where the house would stand. After a period of intense collaboration between Charles and Ray, the scheme was radically changed to sit more quietly in the land and avoid impinging upon the pleasant meadow that fronted the house. Although Eero Saarinen did not have any contribution to the Eames House as built, he did co-design the Entenza House (Case Study House #9) with Charles Eames next door for John Entenza. Eames House from Eames Studio The new Eames House design featured a residence building and a studio building tucked into the landscape's slope, with an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall by 200 foot (60 m) long concrete retaining wall. The lower level of the residence features a living room with alcove, hall with closets and spiral staircase, kitchen, and utility space. The upper level holds two bedrooms and overlooks the double- height living room in mezzanine fashion. The residence's second story also boasts two bathrooms, multiple hallways filled with aluminum closets, and a wire-embedded skylight. The studio building has a similar mezzanine, but is much shorter in length. The studio's ground floor features a utility sink, bathroom, dark room for processing photographs, and a large open space with double-volume height. The upper floor was primarily used as storage, but occasionally became guest quarters. A courtyard was also introduced, separating the residence from the studio space. This revised scheme required only one additional beam. The 17 foot (5.1 m) tall facade is broken down into a rigidly geometric composition of brightly-colored and neutral-colored panels between thin steel columns and braces, painted \\"a warm grey\\". Over time, painting schemes allowed the grey to become black. The entry door is marked with a gold-leaf panel above. Planted in the 1880s by Abbot Kinney, an existing row of eucalyptus trees was preserved along the exposed wall of the house, providing some shading and a visual contrast with the house's bold facade. As for the interior design, the Eameses' collection includes, among others: an Isamu Noguchi floor lamps, folk and Abstract Expressionist art, Japanese kokeshi dolls, Chinese lacquered pillows, Native American baskets, Thonet chairs, and numerous Eames furniture designs (some of which never made it past the prototype stage). The maximalist interiors were grouped by the Eameses in idiosyncratic tableaux and the home's interior decorating has sparked conversation of the Eameses \\"humanizing\\" modernism. Eames Studio Of the twenty-five Case Study Houses built, the Eames house is considered the most successful both as an architectural statement and as a comfortable, functional living space. The brash sleekness of the design made it a favorite backdrop for fashion shoots in the 1950s and 1960s for publications such as Vogue. Perhaps the proof of its success in fulfilling its program is the fact that it remained at the center of the Eameses' life and work from the time they moved in (Christmas Eve 1949) until their deaths. Eames House is one prominent architectural example with the influence of the De Stijl Movement outside Europe. The sliding walls and windows give it the trademark versatility and openness of the De Stijl Movement. After the Eameses died, the house was largely unchanged. The Eames Foundation The Eames House is operated by The Eames Foundation, a non-profit foundation established in 2004 by Lucia Eames, Charles Eames‚Äôs daughter from his first marriage. The Eames Foundation's corporate sponsors are the Eames Office, Herman Miller, and Vitra. On September 20, 2006, the Eames House was designated a National Historic Landmark (and administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day). In 2011, the contents of the living room were reassembled at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as a centerpiece of the exhibition ‚ÄúCalifornia Design, 1930-1965: Living in a Modern Way‚Äù.Christopher Hawthorne (September 30, 2011), Review: 'California Design 1930-1965: Living in a Modern Way' at LACMA Los Angeles Times. Also in 2011, the Eames Foundation hired Los Angeles architectural firm Escher GuneWardena to develop a plan for the house, one that would restore and preserve the house as it was in 1988. In 2012, the Getty Conservation Institute pledged about $250,000 to preservation-related research work at the Eames House.Christopher Hawthorne (March 21, 2012), New Getty initiative aims to boost preservation of modern architecture Los Angeles Times. In 2013, the Eames Foundation teamed up with the digital marketing agency Nebo to produce limited-edition prints for auction with a goal of raising $150,000; every donation will be matched by an Authenticity Fund created by modern furniture manufacturers Herman Miller and Vitra.Ellen Himelfarb (February 22, 2013), Eames Foundation sells prints in fundraising bid to save Eames House Wallpaper. Lucia Eames passed away in 2014, leaving her five children as the Board of Directors of the Eames Foundation. Together, with the help of staff and docents, they oversee the ownership, conservation, and visitor services of the two structures, landscaping, and Charles and Ray's belongings. The Eames Foundation's 250 Year Project hopes to conserve and care for the home for 250 years into the future. The Eames House is open to the public five days a week for reservations, which include exterior self-guided visits, private interior tours, picnics, events, and more.Eames House and Studio Literature In February 2010 LAS Magazine posted an article about the building's history and current significance to the Eames Century Modern Collection, a typography project by design studio House Industries.LAS House Industries Eames Century Modern article In April 2019, the Getty Conservation Institute released the Conservation Management Plan (CMP) of the Eames House. This publication spanned over 200 pages and featured Eames House history, current use of the property, potential damage and ecological risks, and mitigations for conservation. This publication will aid the Eames Foundation's 250 Year Project for conservation and serves as a tool for other stewards of modern architecture around the globe.

It represents in Crimean Tatar, Malay, Nauruan and romanized Quenya. In Breton and in Rohingya, it denotes nasalization of the preceding vowel. Unlike many other letters that use diacritic marks (such as √ú in Catalan, Spanish and German and √á in Catalan, French and Portuguese), √ë in Spanish, Galician, Basque, Asturian, Leonese, Guarani and Filipino is considered a letter in its own right, has its own name (in Spanish: '), and its own place in the alphabet (after N). Historically it came from a doubled N. Its alphabetical independence is similar to the Germanic W, which came from a doubled V. History In medieval times, \\"~\\" was a shorthand for an extra \\"N\\". Thus, this inscription is read \\"Tanto monta\\" (\\"it amounts as much\\"). It was engraved in Alhambra after Reconquista by the Catholic Kings, meaning that both Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon were equivalent in power (\\"Tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando\\"). Historically, √± arose as a ligature of nn; the tilde was shorthand for the second n, written over the first;Buitrago, A., Torijano, J. A.: \\"Diccionario del origen de las palabras\\". Espasa Calpe, S. A., Madrid, 1998. compare umlaut, of analogous origin. This is a letter in the Spanish alphabet that is used for many words, for example, the Spanish word a√±o (anno in Old Spanish) meaning \\"year\\" and derived from Latin annus. Other languages used the macron over an n or m to indicate simple doubling. Already in medieval Latin palaeography, the sign that in Spanish came to be called virgulilla (meaning \\"little comma\\") was used over a vowel to indicate a following nasal consonant (n or m) that had been omitted, as in t√£tus for tantus or qu√£ for quam. This usage was passed on to other languages using the Latin alphabet although it was subsequently dropped by most. Spanish retained it, however, in some specific cases, particularly to indicate the palatal nasal, the sound that is now spelt as √±. The word tilde comes from Spanish, derived by metathesis of the word t√≠tulo as tidlo, this originally from Latin TITVLVS \\"title\\" or \\"heading\\"; compare cabildo with Latin CAPITULUM.Oxford English Dictionary From spellings of anno abbreviated as a√±o, as explained above, the tilde was thenceforth transferred to the n and kept as a useful expedient to indicate the new palatal nasal sound that Spanish had developed in that position: a√±o. The sign was also adopted for the same palatal nasal in all other cases, even when it did not derive from an original nn, as in le√±a (from Latin ligna) or se√±or (from Latin SENIOR). Other Romance languages have different spellings for this sound: Italian and French use gn, a consonant cluster that had evolved from Latin, whereas Occitan, Vietnamese and Portuguese chose nh and Catalan (ny) even though these digraphs had no etymological precedent. When Morse code was extended to cover languages other than English, the sequence ( ‚Äî ‚Äî ¬∑ ‚Äî ‚Äî ) was allotted for this character. Although √± is used by other languages whose spellings were influenced by Spanish, it has recently been chosen to represent the identity of the Spanish language, especially as a result of the battle against its obliteration from computer keyboards by an English-led industry.  Cross-linguistic usage  The letter √± used in the word pi√±ata In Spanish and some other languages (such as Philippine languages, Aymara, Quechua, Mapudung√∫n, Guarani, Basque, Chamorro, Leonese and Yavapai), whose orthographies have some basis in that of Spanish, it represents a palatal nasal. In Galician, it represents such a sound, but it was probably not adopted from Spanish, as evidenced by its presence in the first Galician- Portuguese written in Galicia conserved text (', written in 1228). In Tetum, it was adopted to represent the same sound in Portuguese loanwords represented by nh, although this is also used in Tetum, as is ny, influenced by Indonesian. Other Romance languages also have the sound, written nh in Occitan (espahn√≤l/espanh√≤u) and Portuguese (espanhol), gn in Italian (spagnolo) and French (espagnol), and ny in Catalan and Aragonese (espanyol). The accented letter ≈Ñ used in Polish, the caroned letter ≈à (used in Czech and Slovak) and the digraph «å used in Serbo-Croatian are also equivalent to the Spanish letter √±. The same sound is written ny in Indonesian, Zhuang, and Hungarian, and nh in Vietnamese and Portuguese. In Tagalog, Visayan, and other Philippine languages, it is also written as ny for most terms. The conventional exceptions (with considerable variations) are proper names, which usually retain √± and their original Spanish or Hispanicised spelling (Santo Ni√±o, Para√±aque, Ma√±alac, Malaca√±an). It is collated as the 15th letter of the Filipino alphabet. In old Filipino orthography, the letter was also used, along with g, to represent the velar nasal sound (except at the end of a word, when ng would be used) if appropriate instead of a tilde, which originally spanned a sequence of n and g (as in nÕ†g), such as panÕ†galan (\\"name\\"). That is because the old orthography was based on Spanish, and without the tilde, pangalan would have been pronounced with the sequence (therefore pang-GAlan). The form √±g became a more common way to represent nÕ†g until the early 20th century, mainly because it was more readily available in typesets than the tilde spanning both letters. It is also used to represent the velar nasal in Crimean Tatar, Malay and Nauruan. In Latin-script writing of the distantly- related Tatar language, √± is sometimes used as a substitute for n with descender, which is not available on many computer systems. In the Breton language, it nasalises the preceding vowel, as in Ja√± , which corresponds to the French name Jean and has the same pronunciation. It is used in a number of English terms of Spanish origin, such as jalape√±o, pi√±a colada, pi√±ata, and El Ni√±o. The Spanish word ca√±√≥n, however, became naturalized as canyon. Until the middle of the 20th century, adapting it as nn was more common in English, as in the phrase \\"Battle of Corunna\\". Now, it is almost always left unmodified. The Society for the Advancement of Spanish Letters in the Anglo Americas (SASLAA) is the preeminent organization focused on promoting the permanent adoption of √± into the English language. In Gilbertese, √± and √±g represents nn and ngng. In the orthography for languages of Senegal, √± represents the palatal nasal. Senegal is unique among countries of West Africa in using this letter. The Lule Sami language uses the letter ≈Ñ, which is often written √± on computers, since √± but not ≈Ñ was available on keyboards and in the Latin-1 character set. The nj in West Frisian language has a sound somewhat like the √ë in Spanish  Cultural significance  Serial letter '√ë' Potez 540 plane of the Spanish Republican Air Force The letter √ë has come to represent the identity of the Spanish language. Latin publisher Bill Teck labeled Hispanic culture and its influence on the United States \\"Generation √ë\\" and later started a magazine with that name. Organizations such as the Instituto Cervantes and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists have adopted the letter as their mark for Hispanic heritage. It was used in the Spanish Republican Air Force for aircraft identification. The circumstances surrounding the crash of serial '√ë' Potez 540 plane that was shot down over the Sierra de G√∫dar range of the Sistema Ib√©rico near Valdelinares inspired French writer Andr√© Malraux to write the novel L'Espoir (1937), translated into English as Man's Hope and made into the movie named Espoir: Sierra de Teruel.Forging Man's Fate in Spain, The Nation, March 20, 1937 In 1991, a European Community report recommended the repeal of a regulation preventing the sale in Spain of computer products not supporting \\"all the characteristics of the Spanish writing system,\\" claiming that it was a protectionist measure against the principles of the free market. This would have allowed the distribution of keyboards without an \\"√ë\\" key. The Real Academia Espa√±ola stated that the matter was a serious attack against the language. Nobel Prize winner in literature Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez expressed his disdain over its elimination by saying: \\"The '√ë' is not an archaeological piece of junk, but just the opposite: a cultural leap of a Romance language that left the others behind in expressing with only one letter a sound that other languages continue to express with two.\\" Among other forms of controversy are those pertaining to the anglicization of Spanish surnames. The replacement of √± with another letter alters the pronunciation and meaning of a word or name, in the same manner that replacing any letter in a given word with another one would. For example, Pe√±a is a common Spanish surname and a common noun that means \\"rocky hill\\"; it is often anglicized as Pena, changing the name to the Spanish word for \\"pity\\", often used in terms of sorrow. When Federico Pe√±a was first running for mayor of Denver in 1983, the Denver Post printed his name without the tilde as \\"Pena.\\" After he won the election, they began printing his name with the tilde. As Pe√±a's administration had many critics, their objections were sometimes whimsically expressed as \\"√ëO.\\" Since 2011, CNN's Spanish- language news channel incorporates a new logo wherein a tilde is placed over two Ns. Another news channel, TLN en Espa√±ol, has \\"tl√±\\", with an √± taking the place of the expected n, as its logo. The city council of A Coru√±a changed the placement of the tilde from over the to over the initial to create a logo,http://www.coruna.gal/ in a way similar to what was done by the city of G√∂teborg that changed the dieresis of the to a colon (). The is however not used in the URL.  Computer usage  √ë is to the right of L on a Spanish keyboard layout. In Unicode √ë has the code U+00D1 (decimal 209) while √± has the code U+00F1 (decimal 241). Additionally, they can be generated by typing N or n followed by a combining tilde modifier, ÃÉ, U+0303, decimal 771. In HTML character entity reference, the codes for √ë and √± are \`&Ntilde;\` and \`&ntilde;\` or \`&#209;\` and \`&#241;\`. √ë and √± have their own key in the Spanish and Latin American keyboard layouts (see the corresponding sections at keyboard layout and Tilde#Role of mechanical typewriters). The following instructions apply only to English-language keyboards. On Android devices, holding n or N down on the keyboard makes entry of √± and √ë possible. On Apple Macintosh operating systems (including Mac OS X), it can be typed by pressing and holding the Option key and then typing N, followed by typing either N or n. On the iPhone and iPad, which use the Apple iOS operating system, the √± is accessed by holding down the \\"n\\" key, which opens a menu (on an English- language keyboard). Apple's Mac OS X 10.7 Lion operating system also made the \\"√±\\" available in the same way. The lowercase √± can be made in the Microsoft Windows operating system by doing or on the numeric keypad (with Num Lock turned on);Note that this depends on locale. E.g. will generate ≈Ñ in some eastern European locales, and there is no alternative keystroke for √± in these locales. The same applies to uppercase √ë. the uppercase √ë can be made with or . Character Map in Windows identifies the letter as \\"Latin Small/Capital Letter N With Tilde\\". A soft (not physical) Spanish-language keyboard is easily installed in Windows. In Microsoft Word, √ë can be typed by pressing Control-Shift-Tilde (~) and then an N. On Linux it can be created by pressing Ctrl+Shift+U and then typing '00d1' or '00f1', followed by space or Ctrl to end the character code input. This produces √ë or √±. Another option (for any operating system) is to configure the system to use the US-International keyboard layout, with which √± can be produced either by holding Alt Gr and then pressing N, or by typing the tilde (~) followed by n. Yet another option is to use a compose key (hardware-based or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then ~, and then n results in √±. A capital N can be substituted to produce √ë, and in most cases the order of ~ and n can be reversed. = Use in URLs = The letter √ë may be used in internationalized domain names, but it will have to be converted from Unicode to ASCII during the registration process (i.e. from www.pi√±ata.com to www.xn--piata- pta.com).http://mct.verisign-grs.com/convertServlet?input=pi%C3%B1ata In URLs (except for the domain name), √ë may be replaced by \`%C3%91\`, and √± by \`%C3%B1\`. This is not needed for newer browsers. The hex digits represent the UTF-8 encoding of the glyphs √ë and √±. This feature allows almost any Unicode character to be encoded, and it is considered important to support languages other than English.

Early life and education Born in Germany, he developed his first game at the age of eight. He gained a Master of Science from Syracuse University in the United States and a doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Ulm in Germany. He went on to manage a two-billion-dollar financial company. Career Knizia has been a full-time game designer since 1997, when he quit his job from the board of a large international bank. Knizia has been living in England since 1993. In addition to having designed over 600 published games, Knizia is highly acclaimed as a designer, having won the Deutscher Spiele Preis four times, a Spiel des Jahres (in addition to a Kinderspiel des Jahres and a special award), and numerous other national and international awards. At the Origins Game Fair in 2002 he was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame. His games frequently make appearances on various \\"top games\\" lists, including the GAMES 100 list, the BoardGameGeek top 100, and the Internet Top 100 Games List. Several gaming conventions host \\"Kniziathons\\", which are tournaments dedicated to celebrating Knizia-designed games. Reiner Knizia started developing games for his play-by-mail game zine Postspillion, founded in 1985. The zine still exists, and the game Bretton Woods (also a Reiner Knizia design), which was started in 1987, is still going. One of Knizia's best selling games is Lord of the Rings, published in 17 languages with over one million copies sold. His dice game Pickomino has also reached 1 million copies sold and his Keltis sold over 600,000 copies. His game Ingenious has been published in over 20 languages. In 2011, Knizia designed a Star Trek-themed game for NECA/WizKids, based on the 2009 film that 'reset' the Star Trek universe. In 2015 Ravensburger released Star Wars VII - Galaxy Rebellion based on the popular movie franchise. A number of Knizia designs have been redeveloped for the electronic gaming & console markets. Ingenious (aka Einfach Genial) and Keltis have both appeared in CD-ROM versions; Lost Cities was adapted for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. An original game for the Nintendo DS, Dr. Reiner Knizia's Brainbenders was published in 2008; Keltis for the NDS followed in 2009. Other mobile implementations of Knizia titles include Lost Cities, Battle Line, Kingdoms, Medici, Ra, Through the Desert, Samurai and Tigris and Euphrates. Knizia has also designed various game applications specifically for the iPhone, including Robot Master, Dice Monster, Labyrinth and Pipes. Over several years Knizia has developed a number of hybrid boardgames with electronic components, most notably with German publisher Ravensburger. The first of these was the King Arthur adventure game in 2003, later updated for use with the iPhone in 2014. Other titles include Die Insel, the award-winning Wer War's?, Der Drei ??? and in 2015 Captain Black (notable for a talking ghost pirate captain and a 90 cm - 3 feet - 3D ship). Game characteristics Knizia's games cover many board game genres. He has designed small two-player card games, children's games, simple games, sophisticated games, and even a live-action roleplaying game. One element of modern game design that Reiner Knizia has pioneered is abstract theme. Older themed games like Monopoly have traditionally developed their themes by trying to model or emulate the environment or situation they are thematically tied to. So Monopoly has players buying and developing properties as a real estate developer might. Knizia's thematic game designs tend not to try to model a specific environment, but instead try to invoke the thought and decision- making processes that are key to the theme. For example, Knizia's game Medici has a fairly abstract game system of drawing and buying cards that does not try to model any particular environment, but in the game-world, the players are always attempting to price risk, the key success factor in the investment banking business in which the Medicis made their fortune. A further example of this can be found in Knizia's game, Tigris and Euphrates. The players each take control of one of four different dynasties of Mesopotamia around 3,000 B.C. Each dynasty has priests, farmers, traders, and kings who are placed strategically on the board. The players take turns expanding their dynasties, controlling rivers, building temples, and attacking the other players' dynasties. Instead of Tigris and Euphrates having many complicated rules, the game is relatively simple and has very streamlined rules that does not attempt to emulate the real-life conflicts but rather abstracts this out, allowing for the players to focus on strategic decision making. This approach has allowed Knizia to develop games that are comparatively simple but require thoughtful game-play, while still retaining strongly thematic elements.

Before the 1930s, Belchite was a growing city, with many services. As a consequence of the Battle of Belchite, during the Spanish Civil War, the city was totally destroyed. Instead of a reconstruction, Franco decided to keep the ruins of the old town of Belchite intact as a memorial of the battle. As of 1964, the town was totally deserted, the inhabitants having been removed to Belchite Nuevo, on the side of the old town. The ruins, which are not accommodated for tourism, are visited by more than 10,000 tourists annually. It is also a well-known meeting point for Francoist nostalgics, especially Falangists. * Granadilla, Extremadura * Aldealcardo, Soria * La Cornudilla, Valencia * Erillcastell, near El Pont de Suert, Catalonia * Esperan, near El Pont de Suert, Catalonia * J√°novas, Fiscal * Lacort, Fiscal * Llombai in the Vall de Gallinera, Alacant * Ochate, Condado de Trevi√±o, Burgos, Castille and Leon * Peranera, near El Pont de Suert, Catalonia * Pernui in Sort, Lleida, Catalonia * Viuet, near El Pont de Suert, Catalonia =Ukraine= After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, hundreds of settlements within the exclusion zone were evacuated.

(1998). \\"Johnny PayCheck is a fictional Name for the GTA serie where he uses his name Johnny Pay check to resemble Johnny cash and make remixed music based on Johnny cash's music\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 408. was an American country music singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and Grand Ole Opry member notable for recording the David Allan Coe song \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\". He achieved his greatest success in the 1970s as a force in country music's \\"outlaw movement\\" popularized by artists Hank Williams Jr., Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver, and Merle Haggard. In the 1980s, his music career slowed due to drug, alcohol and legal problems. He served a prison sentence in the early 1990s and his declining health effectively ended his career in early 2000. In 1980, Paycheck appeared on the PBS music program Austin City Limits (season 5). Early career Johnny Paycheck was born Donald Eugene Lytle on May 31, 1938, in Greenfield, Ohio. By age 9, Lytle was already playing in talent contests. His big break came in the early 1960s when he convinced country music legend George Jones to hire him. Paycheck provided harmony vocals as well as bass and steel guitar for Jones. He later co-wrote Jones's hit song \\"Once You've Had the Best.\\" Paycheck was a tenor harmony singer with numerous hard country performers in the late 1950s and early 1960s including Ray Price. Paycheck, along with Willie Nelson, worked in Price's band the Cherokee Cowboys. He is featured as a tenor singer on recordings by Faron Young, Roger Miller, and Skeets McDonald. In 1960, he reached Top 35 status in Cashbox magazine's country charts as Donny Young with the tune \\"Miracle Of Love\\". From the early to mid-1960s, he also enjoyed some success as a songwriter for others, with his biggest songwriting hit being \\"Apartment No. 9\\", which served as Tammy Wynette's first chart hit in December 1966. In 1964, he changed his name legally to Johnny Paycheck, taking the name from Johnny Paychek, a top ranked boxer from Chicago (and not directly as a humorous alternative to Johnny Cash as is commonly believed) who once fought Joe Louis for the heavyweight title.\\"Obituary: 'Johnny Paycheck: Hell-raising country singer'\\", independent.co.uk, February 21, 2003; accessed March 26, 2015. He first charted under his new name with \\"A-11\\" in 1965. His best- selling single from this period was \\"She's All I Got\\", which reached No. 2 on the U.S. country singles charts in 1971 and made it onto the Billboard Hot 100. His \\"Mr. Lovemaker\\" also reached No. 2 on the U.S. country singles chart in 1973. But with the popularity of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings in the mid 1970s, Paycheck changed his image to that of outlaw, with which he was to have his largest financial success. It was his producer Billy Sherrill who helped revive his career by significantly changing his sound and image. Sherrill was best known for carefully choreographing his records and infusing them with considerable pop feel. The Paycheck records were clearly based on Sherrill's take on the bands backing Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson on records. A member of the Grand Ole Opry, Paycheck is best remembered for his 1977 hit single, \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\", written by David Allan Coe. The song sold over two million copies, and inspired a motion picture of the same name. \\"Colorado Kool-Aid\\", \\"Me and the IRS\\", \\"Friend, Lover, Wife\\", \\"Slide Off of Your Satin Sheets\\", and \\"I'm the Only Hell (Mama Ever Raised)\\" were other hits for Paycheck during this period. He received an Academy of Country Music Career Achievement award in 1977. Later life In 1981 Paycheck appeared on an episode of the television show The Dukes of Hazzard as himself. The scene had him playing \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\" and arguing with Boss Hogg when the sheriff tried to give him a citation over the content of the song. In December 1985, Paycheck was convicted and sentenced to seven years in jail for shooting a man at the North High Lounge in Hillsboro, Ohio; he fired a .22 pistol and the bullet grazed the man's head. Paycheck claimed the act was self-defense. After several years spent fighting the sentence, he began serving his sentence in 1989, spending 22 months in prison before being pardoned by Ohio Governor Richard Celeste.Paul W. Dennis, \\"Forgotten Artists: Donald Lytle, aka Donny Young\\", the9513.com, March 4, 2010. The most successful of his later singles, released during his appeal, was \\"Old Violin\\", which reached # 21 on the country chart in 1986. His last album to chart was \\"Modern Times\\" in 1987. He continued to release albums, the last of which, Remembering, appeared in 2002. In 1990, he filed for bankruptcy after tax problems with the IRS. Although Paycheck was addicted to drugs and alcohol during his career, he later was said to have \\"put his life in order\\"Profile, CNN.com, February 19, 2003. after his prison stay. He continued to perform and tour until the late 1990s. Shortly before his retirement, in 1997, he was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry; in a rare exception to protocol, Opry general manager Bob Whittaker personally invited Paycheck to join instead of having another member do the invitation. Illness and death After 2000, his health would only allow for short appearances. Contracting emphysema and asthma after a lengthy illness, Paycheck died at Nashville's Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2003, aged 64. He was buried in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville, in a plot donated by George Jones. He is survived by his wife Sharon Rae Paycheck and son Jonathan Paycheck. He had two brothers, Jeff and Bud Lytle who are both deceased. Little Darlin' Records With his producer, Aubrey Mayhew, Paycheck co-owned his record company, Little Darlin' Records. Paycheck's Little Darlin' recordings featured the pedal steel guitar work of Lloyd Green. By the end of the 1960s, Little Darlin' Records folded. Mayhew and Paycheck soon set up shop under the name Certron Records, the newly formed recording company owned by Certron (a manufacturer of audio and video tape). The label was able to sign Bobby Helms, Ronnie Dove, Clint Eastwood, Pozo-Seco Singers (as Pozo Seco), and Paycheck. The label was a failure and closed by 1972. In the late 1990s, after taking them for granted for years, country music historians began to recognize the distinctive and sharp-edged sound of the Little Darlin' recordings as unique in their time, Paycheck's in particular. Legacy A tribute album, Touch My Heart: a Tribute to Johnny Paycheck, was released in 2004 on the Sugar Hill Label. Produced by Robbie Fulks, the album features George Jones, Marshall Crenshaw, Hank Williams III, Al Anderson, Dallas Wayne, Neko Case, Gail Davies and Fulks himself covering some of Paycheck's best-known songs. In his song \\"Grand Ole Opry (Ain't So Grand Anymore)\\", Hank Williams III praises Paycheck (along with Waylon Jennings) as a \\"real rebel\\" the Grand Ole Opry only reluctantly inducted. His song \\"It Won't Be Long (And I'll Be Hating You)\\" appeared in the video game Grand Theft Auto V.

For much of its length the river forms part of the border between England and Wales. The Wye Valley (lower part) is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Wye is important for nature conservation and recreation but is severely impacted by pollution. Etymology The meaning of the name is not clear. Possibly the earliest reference to the name is Guoy in Nennius' early 9th Century Historia Brittonum and the modern Welsh name is Gwy. The Wye was much later given a Latin name Vaga, an adjective meaning 'wandering'. The Tithe map references a Vagas Field in both Whitchurch and Chepstow.The Tithe map (1844) Philologists such as Edward Lye and Joseph Bosworth in the 18th and early 19th centuriesBosworth, Joseph A Dictionary of the Anglo-saxon Language (1838) suggested an Old English derivation from w√¶g, \\"wave\\". Description The source of the Wye is in the Welsh mountains at Plynlimon. It flows through or past several towns and villages including Rhayader, Builth Wells, Hay-on-Wye, Hereford (the only city on the River Wye), Ross-on-Wye, Symonds Yat, Monmouth and Tintern, meeting the Severn estuary just below Chepstow. Its total length is . The lower of the river from Redbrook to Chepstow forms the border between England and Wales. Conservation The River Wye is protected by two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, one covering the Upper Wye (Gwy Uchaf) above Hay-on-Wye, and one covering the Lower Wye (Gwy Isaf) downstream to Chepstow. The criteria for inclusion of the river as an SSSI include geology, topography, flora, mammals, invertebrates, fish and birdlife, as the river and its tributaries constitute a large linear ecosystem. The Lower Wye SSSI is itself divided into seven units of assessment set by Natural England, and administrative responsibilities are shared between the councils of Powys, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and Monmouthshire. The Wye abuts a range of other SSSIs in England and Wales, including the Upper Wye Gorge and Lower Wye Gorge. It is also a Special Area of Conservation and one of the most important rivers in the UK for nature conservation. It is an important migration route and wildlife corridor, as well as a key breeding area for many nationally and internationally important species. The river supports a range of species and habitats covered by European Directives and those listed under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. In Powys the river lies within the Radnorshire Environmentally Sensitive Area. Much of the lower valley is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. =Salmon= The Lower Wye has been designated as a salmonid fishery under the EC Freshwater Fish Directive. The Wye is largely unpolluted and used to be considered one of the best rivers for salmon fishing in the United Kingdom, outside Scotland. In the 1980s and 1990s salmon in the Wye declined dramatically. In 1967 the Wye rod catch was 7,864, and as recently as 1988 it was 6,401; but by 2002 it was only 357. It is now recovering from this low in response to the extensive habitat improvement work carried out by the Wye and Usk Foundation, set up to restore the spring salmon runs. In 2015 the five-year average once again climbed above 1,000 and it is now the third best salmon river in England and Wales, surpassed only by the Tyne and Wear. The Wye was particularly famous for its large \\"spring\\" salmon that had spent three or more years at sea before returning to spawn. They used to enter the river between January and June and sometimes reached weights of over , the largest recorded being landed after a long fight by Miss Doreen Davey from the Cowpond Pool at Winforton on 13 March 1923. The last recorded rod-caught salmon from the Wye was taken in 1963 by Donald Parrish and weighed . Since the early 2000s the spring catch has been steadily recovering and salmon of over have been reported every year since 2011.  Pollution  Pollution has severely impacted the river, the Wye does not meet European and national standards on river health. Pollution from chicken and dairy farms has become so bad the Wye has been used as an example of river pollution in the UK on Countryfile and in several national newspapers of including The Times, The Guardian and the Daily Mail. This pollution causes algal blooms several times a year with increasing frequency and length, depleting the oxygen in the water causing fish like brown trout, chubb and barbel as well as aquatic invertebrates and plants to suffocate to death. Fish and aquatic invertebrates are the main food source for otters, kingfishers, herons, eels and other protected species. Along with many other rivers the Wye is being heavily polluted by manure from the 10 million free range chickens for eggs and meat in intensive poultry units (IPUs) in Powys and Herefordshire, contaminating the Wye's tributaries. There are over 110 IPUs in Powys, each with over 40,000 birds. In addition runoff from dairy farms, farm slurry and silage liquor are entering the Wye, a study by the Welsh government found that only 1% of farm slurry stores in Wales met regulations and that farms were purposely spreading slurry on fields before high rainfall leading to increased run off into waterways. An investigation by Greenpeace found that Environment Agency staff cuts from austerity had reduced pollution inspections by up to one third. An internal report by the Environment Agency showed that the use of a ‚Äúvoluntary approach‚Äù by government was leading to increased levels of river pollution across the UK. Powys County Council approved the construction of 20 new free- range chicken sheds in 2019 and continues to license new chicken farms behind closed doors. History The Wye at Chepstow, showing the castle and the road bridge linking Monmouthshire (on the left) with Gloucestershire The Romans constructed a bridge of wood and stone just upstream of present-day Chepstow. The River Wye has been navigable up to Monmouth since at least the early 14th century. It was improved from there to a short distance below Hereford by William Sandys in the early 1660s with locks to enable vessels to pass weirs. According to Herefordshire Council Archaeology, these were flash locks. The work proved to be insufficiently substantial and in 1696 a further Act of Parliament authorised the County of Hereford to buy up and demolish the mills on the Wye and Lugg. All locks and weirs were removed, except that at New Weir forge below Goodrich, which survived until about 1815. This was paid for by a tax on the county. Weirs were removed all along the Wye in Herefordshire, making the river passable to the western boundary, and beyond it at least to Hay on Wye. A horse towing path was added in 1808, but only up to Hereford; previously, as on the River Severn, barges were man-hauled. Money was spent several times improving the River Lugg from Leominster to its confluence with the Wye at Mordiford, but its navigation is likely to have been difficult. The Wye remained commercially navigable until the 1850s, when commercial traffic moved to railways. It is still used by pleasure craft. Navigation and sport Kayaking near Hay-on-Wye The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the river. The Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river is Bigsweir and navigation below this point is under the control of the Gloucester Harbour Trustees as Competent Harbour Authority. There is a public right of navigation downstream from Hay-on-Wye. Canoes are generally permitted at and downstream of Glasbury, so long as they do not disturb anglers.

The River Wye provides for canoeing and kayaking as it has sections suitable for all ranges of skills and free access all the way downstream from Hay to Hereford and Monmouth, and the tidal Wye to Chepstow and the Severn Estuary. There are a wide range of canoe hire and supervised trips, as well as campsites at key points on the river. Symonds Yat has a particularly popular series of rapids that was purchased by the British Canoe Union in 2003 to preserve the rapids for recreational use, canoe trips through the rapids stop next at Monmouth. There are three rowing clubs on the river at Hereford, Ross- on-Wye and Monmouth. Annual regattas are held at Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth for rowers and scullers of all abilities, next to the local rowing club. In 2017 more than 600 people took to the River Wye in inflatables ranging from dinghies to paddling pools during the event WYE FLOAT, opened by former Olympic ski jumper Eddie the Eagle. Walkers can enjoy the Wye Valley Walk which follows the route of the River Wye from Coed Hafren, near Plynlimon, to Chepstow along a series of well-maintained way-marked paths. A viewpoint near The Biblins on the Wye is known as 'Three Counties View', the meeting place of the counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire. Tributaries The Wye's tributaries include the river Lugg, Elan, Dulas, Irfon, Marteg, Monnow, Trothy, Ithon, Llynfi, Letton Lake, Tarennig (the Wye's first tributary) and Bidno.

The central part of South Wales was particularly affected. The river over-topped its banks and caused flash flooding in several areas including Hay-on-Wye, Hereford, Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth. Much of Hereford was flooded with homes inundated. Churches and leisure centres were opened to accommodate evacuated residents. The river at Monmouth reached its highest level ever recorded.\\"Storm Dennis: Herefordshire flooding updates\\", Hereford Times, 18 February 2020[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51540009 \\"Storm Dennis: Flood warnings as River Wye reaches record high\\", BBC News, 18 February 2020 Cultural references The Romantic poet William Wordsworth includes an apostrophe to the Wye in his famous poem \\"Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey\\" published 1798 in Lyrical Ballads: > How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, > O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods, > How often has my spirit turned to thee! Nelson travelled down the Wye in 1802, along with Lady Hamilton and her husband, Sir William Hamilton. They sailed from Ross-on-Wye to Monmouth, to be greeted by a cannonade and the band of the Monmouthshire Militia playing See, the Conquering Hero Comes. Nelson expressed surprise that he was known at \\"such a little gut of a river as the Wye\\".

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times.  Life  Meredith was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, a son and grandson of naval outfitters. His mother died when he was five. At the age of 14 he was sent to a Moravian School in Neuwied, Germany, where he remained for two years. He read law and was articled as a solicitor, but abandoned that profession for journalism and poetry. He collaborated with Edward Gryffydh Peacock, son of Thomas Love Peacock, in publishing a privately circulated literary magazine, the Monthly Observer. He married Edward Peacock's widowed sister Mary Ellen Nicolls in 1849 when he was twenty-one years old and she was twenty-eight. Meredith collected his early writings, first published in periodicals, in an 1851 volume, Poems. In 1856 he posed as the model for The Death of Chatterton, a notable painting by the English Pre-Raphaelite painter Henry Wallis (1830‚Äì1916). His wife ran off with Wallis in 1858; she died three years later. The collection of sonnets entitled Modern Love (1862) emerged from this experience as did The Ordeal of Richard Feverel, his first major novel. Meredith married Marie Vulliamy in 1864 and settled in Surrey, first in Norbiton and then, at the end of 1867, near Box Hill. He continued writing novels and poetry, often inspired by nature. He had a keen understanding of comedy and his Essay on Comedy (1877) remains a reference work in the history of comic theory. In The Egoist, published in 1879, he applies some of his theories of comedy in one of his most enduring novels. Some of his writings, including The Egoist, also highlight the subjugation of women during the Victorian period. During most of his career, he had difficulty achieving popular success. His first successful novel was Diana of the Crossways published in 1885. The Death of Chatterton by Henry Wallis, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery version, for which Meredith posed in 1856 Meredith supplemented his often uncertain writer's income with a job as a publisher's reader. His advice to Chapman and Hall made him influential in the world of letters. His friends in the literary world included, at different times, William and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Cotter Morison,Meredith's place in the circles of Rosetti, Swinburne, Morison, Sir Alexander Duff-Gordon and Sir William Hardman is described in S. M. Ellis, A Mid-Victorian Pepys, The Letters and Memoirs of Sir William Hardman, M.A., F.R.G.S (Cecil Palmer, London 1923), which includes an early photograph of George Meredith with his son Arthur Meredith, facing p. 50. Leslie Stephen, Robert Louis Stevenson, George Gissing and J. M. Barrie. Gissing wrote in a letter to his brother Algernon that Meredith's novels were 'of the superlatively tough species'.Letters of George Gissing to members of his family, collected and arranged by Algernon and Ellen Gissing. London: Constable, 1927, letter dated 12 June 1884. His contemporary Sir Arthur Conan Doyle paid him homage in the short-story \\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\", when Sherlock Holmes says to Dr. Watson during the discussion of the case, \\"And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\\" Oscar Wilde, in his dialogue \\"The Decay of Lying\\", implies that Meredith, along with Balzac, is his favourite novelist, saying \\"Ah, Meredith! Who can define him? His style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning\\". In 1868 Meredith was introduced to Thomas Hardy by Frederic Chapman of Chapman & Hall the publishers. Hardy had submitted his first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady. Meredith advised Hardy not to publish his book as it would be attacked by reviewers and destroy his hopes of becoming a novelist. Meredith felt the book was too bitter a satire on the rich and counselled Hardy to put it aside and write another 'with a purely artistic purpose' and more of a plot. Meredith spoke from experience; his first big novel, The Ordeal of Richard Feverel, was judged so shocking that Mudie's circulating library had cancelled an order of 300 copies. Hardy continued in his attempts to publish the novel: however it remained unpublished, though he clearly took Meredith's advice seriously.Tomalin, Claire. Thomas Hardy: The Time Torn Man. New York: Penguin, 2007. Meredith's politics were those of a Radical Liberal and he was friends with other Radicals such as Frederick Maxse and John Morley. Before his death, Meredith was honoured from many quarters: he succeeded Lord Tennyson as president of the Society of Authors; in 1905 he was appointed to the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. In 1909, he died at his home in Box Hill, Surrey. He is buried in the cemetery at Dorking, Surrey.Dorking Museum Personal life Meredith had two wives and three children. He outlived both wives and one child. On 9 August 1849, Meredith married Mary Ellen Nicolls (n√©e Peacock), a beautiful widow with a daughter. They had one child, Arthur (1853‚Äì1890). In 1858 she ran off with the painter Henry Wallis, shortly before giving birth to a child assumed to be Wallis's. Mary Ellen died in 1861. On 20 September 1864, Meredith married Marie Vulliamy. She died of cancer in 1886. Meredith had three children: with Mary Ellen * Arthur Gryffydh (1853‚Äì1890) with Marie * William Maxse (1865‚Äì1937) * Marie Eveleen (known as Mariette) (1871‚Äì1933).

His works were popularized by French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot; the Julia and Mandelbrot fractals are closely related. Military service Julia was born in the Algerian town of Sidi Bel Abbes, at the time governed by the French. During his youth, he had an interest in mathematics and music. His studies were interrupted at the age of 21, when France became involved in World War I and Julia was conscripted to serve with the army. During an attack he suffered a severe injury, losing his nose. His many operations to remedy the situation were all unsuccessful, and for the rest of his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been. Career in mathematics Julia gained attention for his mathematical work after the war when a 199-page article he wrote was featured in the Journal de Math√©matiques Pures et Appliqu√©es, a French mathematics journal. The article, which he published in 1918 at the age of 25, titled \\"M√©moire sur l'it√©ration des fonctions rationnelles\\" described the iteration of a rational function. The article gained immense popularity among mathematicians and the general population as a whole, and so resulted in Julia's later receiving of the Grand Prix de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences. Despite his fame, his works were mostly forgottenAri Ben-Menahem: Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Springer, , p. 3427 until the day Benoit Mandelbrot mentioned them in his works. On 19 March 1978, Julia died in Paris at the age of 85.

The label was known for producing one-sided records with abbreviated versions of songs at a very low price. History Little Wonders were manufactured by the Columbia Phonograph Company, and were distributed exclusively by music publisher Henry Waterson (the business partner of Irving Berlin) in their early years (1914‚Äì1916) ‚Äì an arrangement that has only recently been discovered as the original contract stipulated that both parties were to keep this relationship a secret.Brooks, Tim, with Merle Sprinzen, Little Wonder Records and Bubble Books, An Illustrated History and Discography, p. 8, Denver: Mainspring Press, 2011. Artists are generally uncredited on Little Wonder labels, which simply give recordings general attributions such as \\"band\\", \\"tenor\\", \\"quartette\\", or \\"accordion solo\\". Little Wonders were lateral-cut single sided inch gramophone records. The records contained only about to 2 minutes of music. The small size of the discs (together with the cherubic face on later versions of the label) has led some record collectors to incorrectly assume that Little Wonders were made as children's records; they were actually made for the general audience looking for low-priced recordings. The records retailed for ten cents each, some of the lowest priced recordings available at the time. This price point revolutionized popular recorded music, significantly expanding the market. The audio fidelity is average to slightly above average for the time, with rather narrow grooves (best played with a smaller stylus than contemporary discs). An estimated forty million of these records were sold,Brooks and Sprinzen, p. 27. principally through the sheet music counters of many five and ten cent store chains of the time and through Sears Roebuck catalogs, rather than in record stores. Image:LittleWonderBlueGoose.jpg All known Little Wonders were made by artists who also recorded for Columbia.Brooks and Sprinzen, p. 55. One account says that recording artists would visit the Little Wonder recording studio on one floor of the Woolworth Building before or after making records at the Columbia studio on a higher floor of the same building. There has been some speculation that the masters for Little Wonders were actually warm-up balance checks recorded as tests at the beginning of Columbia recording sessions; if such tests happened to record a usable performance, they would be leased to Little Wonder.Brooks and Sprinzen, p. 56. However, court papers from an early lawsuit between Waterson and Victor Emerson indicate that performers were paid separately and specifically to record for Little Wonder records. Little Wonder #1 was \\"Ben Bolt\\", sung by Henry Burr, who would make more recordings for the label than any other artist. The vaudevillian Sam Ash made the most recordings as a solo artist, beginning with Little Wonder #98, a version of \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\". Al Jolson recorded a version of \\"Back to the Carolina You Love\\" (1914) on the label; Jolson was a Columbia artist, but this was his only Little Wonder recording. Other noted artists of the day whose performances were released (uncredited) on Little Wonder include Gene Greene, Wilbur Sweatman, Billy Murray, Vernon Dalhart, Frank Crumit, the Louisiana Five and the California Ramblers. Beginning in 1916 Columbia took full control of Little Wonder, and in 1917 it began issuing records for children in the same size and using the same numerical series as the ongoing Little Wonders. These discs were enclosed in small illustrated children's books called \\"Bubble Books\\", and were also best sellers.Brooks and Sprinzen, p. 31-48. Much later Columbia also issued various promotional discs in the same \\"small disc\\" numerical series, but these should not be confused with the Little Wonder label. Little Wonder #339, \\"The Camp Meeting Jubilee\\" by a male vocal \\"quartette\\", issued in 1916, contains the lyrics \\"We've been rockin' an' rolling in your arms / Rockin' and rolling in your arms / In the arms of Moses.\\" This is believed to be one of the earliest uses in an audio recording of the phrase \\"rock ... and roll\\", albeit in the context of a religious spiritual.

A prolific author, in 1865 he was appointed editor of the magazine Fun. He founded Tom Hood's Comic Annual in 1867. Biography Hood was born at Lake House, Leytonstone, England, the son of the poet Thomas Hood and his wife. After attending University College School and Louth Grammar School, he entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1853. There he studied for the Church and passed all the examinations for the degree of BA, but did not graduate. At Oxford he wrote his Farewell to the Swallows (1853) and Pen and Pencil Pictures (1854). He began to write for the Liskeard Gazette in 1856, and edited that paper in 1858‚Äì1859. In 1861 he wrote Quips and Cranks, and Daughters of King Daher, and other Poems.The Daughters of King Daher, a Story of the Mohammedan Invasion of Scinde; and other Poems, Saunders, Otley, and Co. 1861. The next year, he published Loves of Tom Tucker and Little Bo-Peep, a Rhyming Rigmarole, followed in 1864 by Vere Vereker's Vengeance, a Sensation, and in 1865 by Jingles and Jokes for the Little Folks. His novels included A Disputed Inheritance (1863), A Golden Heart (1867),A Golden Heart: A Novel, Vol. II, Vol. III, Tinsley Brothers, 1867. The Lost Link (1868),The Lost Link: A Novel, Vol. II, Vol. III, Tinsley Brothers, 1868. Captain Masters's Children (1865),Captain Master's Children: A Novel, Vol. II, Vol. III, Sampson Low, Son, and Marston, 1865. and Love and Valour (1872).Love and Valor, James R. Osgood and Company, 1872. In 1866 he translated Ernest L'√âpine's La L√©gende de Croquemitaine.The Days of Chivalry, or the Legend of Croquemitaine, Cassell, Petter and Galpin, 1866. He also wrote two books on English verse composition, several children's books (in conjunction with his sister, Frances Freeling Broderip), and a body of magazine and journal articles. Hood drew with considerable facility, and illustrated several of his father's comic verses, some of which were collected in his father's book, Precocious Piggy.\\"Clever and kindly Tom Hood, not long before he died, gave me a bound copy of that droll yet sympathetic nursery story, written by his distinguished father the poet and wit, entitled ' The Headlong Career and Woeful Ending of Precocious Piggy.' Tom Hood often told me how, as a little boy, he had enjoyed the comical history, when it was related to him by his father, who had written it especially for the amusement of his children, and who were all, more or less, deeply interested in Piggy's adventures. I have drawn many a laugh and many a tear from the little ones to whom I have read the story, and my copy, a gift from the son, who so cleverly illustrated his father's quaint fancy, is much prized by me.\\" ‚Äî Squire & Effie Bancroft, Mr. & Mrs. Bancroft on and off the Stage, Vol. II, Chap. 1, Richard Bentley & Son, 1888, p. 13. Meanwhile, in 1860, the younger Hood obtained a position in the War Office, which he served for five years. In 1865 he left when selected as editor of Fun, the comic paper, which became very popular under his direction. In private life, Hood's geniality and sincere friendliness secured him the affection and esteem of a wide circle of acquaintance.\\"Tom Hood had an influence among the younger writers and artists of his day that cannot be over-rated. He was the most unselfish and least jealous of men. He loved to get his friends about him to talk shop, and to encourage one another in their various callings. Every Friday night of his life, though not particularly blest with this world's riches, he gave a cheery Bohemian supper-party, to which the best fellows in the world were invited. Who that was privileged to attend them can have forgotten Tom Hood's \\" Friday nights\\" in South Street, Brompton, where after a pipe and music, conversation, and poetry readings, we sat down to a homely meal of cold joint and roast potatoes, and discussed all the wonderful things that we youngsters intended to do in the future.\\" ‚Äî Clement Scott, Thirty Years at the Play, The Railway and General Automatic Library, 1891, pp. 20‚Äì21.

Clockwise from top left: Lincoln's Inn, Middle Temple, Gray's Inn, Inner Temple. The Inns of Court in London are the professional associations for barristers in England and Wales. There are four Inns of Court ‚Äì Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, Inner Temple and Middle Temple. All barristers must belong to one of them. They have supervisory and disciplinary functions over their members. The Inns also provide libraries, dining facilities and professional accommodation. Each also has a church or chapel attached to it and is a self-contained precinct where barristers traditionally train and practise, although growth in the legal profession, together with a desire to practise from more modern accommodations and buildings with lower rents, caused many barristers' chambers to move outside the precincts of the Inns of Court in the late 20th century. History During the 12th and early 13th centuries the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. But a papal bull in 1218 prohibited the clergy from practising in the secular courts (where the English common law system operated, as opposed to the Roman civil law favoured by the Church). As a result, law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of by clerics. To protect their schools from competition, first Henry II and later Henry III issued proclamations prohibiting the teaching of the civil law within the City of London. The common law lawyers worked in guilds of law, modelled on trade guilds, which in time became the inns of court., pp. 32, 36 In the earliest centuries of their existence, beginning with the 14th century, the Inns were any of a sizable number of buildings or precincts where lawyers traditionally lodged, trained and carried on their profession. Over the centuries, the four Inns of Court became where barristers were trained, while the more numerous Inns of Chancery ‚Äì which were affiliated to the Inns of Court ‚Äì were responsible for the training of solicitors. The four Inns of Court are: * The Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn * The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple * The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple * The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn There have been lawyers in the Temple since 1320. In 1337 the premises were divided into Inner Temple, where the lawyers resided, and Middle Temple, which was also occupied by lawyers by 1346. Lincoln's Inn, the largest, is able to trace its official records to 1422. The records of Gray's Inn begin in 1569, but teaching is thought to have begun there in the late fourteenth century. In 1620 it was decided at a meeting of senior judges that all four inns would be equal in order of precedence. In the 16th century and earlier, students or apprentices learned their craft primarily by attending court and sharing both accommodations and education during the legal terms. Prior to the English Civil War in 1642, this training lasted at least seven years; subsequently, the Inns focused their residency requirements on dining together in the company of experienced barristers, to enable learning through contact and networking with experts. In the mid-18th century, the common law was first recognized as a subject for study in the universities, and by 1872, bar examinations became compulsory for entry into the profession of law. =Importance in English Renaissance theatre= The Inns played an important role in the history of the English Renaissance theatre. Notable literary figures and playwrights who resided in the Inns of Court include John Donne, Francis Beaumont, John Marston, Thomas Lodge, Thomas Campion, Abraham Fraunce, Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Thomas More, Sir Francis Bacon, and George Gascoigne. Plays written and performed in the Inns of Court include Gorboduc, Gismund of Salerne, and The Misfortunes of Arthur. An example of a famous masque put on by the Inns was James Shirley‚Äôs The Triumph of Peace. Shakespeare‚Äôs The Comedy of Errors and Twelfth Night were also performed at the Inns, although written for commercial theatre. =Military tradition= Since at least 1584, members of the Inns of Court have rallied to the defence of the realm during times of crisis. That tradition continues to this very day, in that 10 Stone Buildings in Lincoln's Inn has been the permanent home of the Inns of Court & City Yeomanry since the building was freed up by the abolition of the Clerks of Chancery in 1842. Membership and governance Each of the four Inns of Court has three ordinary grades of membership: students, barristers, and masters of the bench or \\"benchers\\". The benchers constitute the governing body for each Inn and appoint new members from among existing barrister members. As a rule, any barrister member of the inn is eligible for appointment. In practice, appointments are made of senior members of the Bar, usually QCs, or High Court judges or those who carry out work on behalf of the Inn, be it on committees or through the training of students and other junior members. The senior bencher of each Inn is the Treasurer, a position which is held for one year only. Each Inn usually also has at least one royal bencher. They may also appoint honorary benchers, from academics, the world of politics and overseas judiciary. The Inns of Court no longer provide all the education and training needed by prospective barristers, who must pass the Bar Professional Training Course, but do provide supplementary education during the 'Bar School' year, pupillage and the early years of practice. All prospective Bar School students must be a member of one of the four Inns, and must attend ten (formerly twelve)\\"Education and Qualification Rules\\" at the Middle Temple website. (Retrieved 9 October 2020.) 'qualifying sessions' before being eligible to qualify as a barrister. Qualifying sessions traditionally comprise formal dinners followed by law- related talks, but increasingly the inns offer training weekends that may count for several sessions' worth of attendance. The Inns still retain the sole right to call qualified students to the bar, which is associated with a graduation ceremony ('Call Day'). Prospective students may choose which Inn to apply to for membership, but can only apply to one Inn for scholarships. It makes no long-term difference which Inn a barrister joins; an applicant might, for example, choose a particular inn because he or she knows someone already a member, or it has a student association at their university. The inns' disciplinary functions are carried out by a joint Council of the Inns of Court, which administers the disciplinary tribunals. Barristers are prosecuted by the Bar Standards Board. Location and layout The four inns are located near one another in central London, near the western boundary of the City of London. Nearby are the Royal Courts of Justice, which were moved for convenience from Westminster Hall to the legal quarter of London in 1882. Middle Temple and Inner Temple are liberties of the City of London, which means they are within the historic boundaries of the City but are not subject to its jurisdiction. They operate as their own local authorities. These two Inns neighbour each other and occupy the core of the Temple area. The closest Tube station is Temple. Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn are in the London Borough of Camden (formerly in the Borough of Holborn) near the boundary with the City of London. They do not have the status of a local authority. The nearest Tube station is Chancery Lane. Each Inn is a substantial complex with a great hall, chapel, libraries, sets of chambers for many hundreds of barristers, and gardens, and covers several acres. The layout is similar to that of an Oxbridge college. The chambers were originally used as residences as well as business premises by many of the barristers, but today they serve as offices with only a small number of apartments.https://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/the- bar/the-inns-of-court-compared Historically related Inns =Serjeants' Inn= Another important inn, Serjeants' Inn, was dissolved in 1877 and its assets were, controversially, distributed amongst the existing members. The membership of the Inn had consisted of a small class of senior barristers called serjeants-at-law, who were selected from the members of the other four inns and had exclusive rights of audience in certain Courts. Their pre- eminence was affected by the new rank of Queen's Counsel, which was granted to barristers who were not serjeants. The serjeant's privileges were withdrawn by the government in the 19th century, no more serjeants were appointed, and they eventually died out. The area now known as Serjeants' Inn, one of two sites formerly occupied by the Serjeants, the other being in Chancery Lane, was purchased by the Inner Temple in 2002. It was formerly the custom for senior judges to join Serjeants' Inn, thereby leaving the Inn in which they had practised as barristers. This meant that the Masters of the Bench of the four barristers' Inns of Court were mostly themselves barristers. Since there is now no Serjeants' Inn, judges remain in the Inns which they joined as students and belonged to as barristers. This has had the effect of making the majority of the Masters of the Bench senior judges, either because they become benchers when appointed as judges, or because they become judges after being appointed as benchers. =Inns of Chancery= There were also Inns of Chancery, including Clement's Inn, Clifford's Inn and Lyon's Inn (attached to the Inner Temple); Strand Inn and New Inn (attached to the Middle Temple); Furnival's Inn and Thavie's Inn (attached to Lincoln's Inn); and Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn (attached to Gray's Inn). There were and are only four Inns of Court, which have a special and historic status including, for example, the authority to call members to the Bar and therefore confer on them rights of audience in the High Court. The other Inns (none of which continues to function) were not Inns of Court. =Irish Inns of Court= There is also an Inn of Court of Northern Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, there is only one Inn of Court, the Honorable Society of King's Inns. American Inns of Court From the late 1970s, U.S. Chief Justice Warren Burger led a movement to create Inns of Court in the United States, loosely modelled after the traditional English Inns. In 1985, he and others established the American Inns of Court Foundation to promote and formally charter local Inns of Court across the United States. Each local Inn is devoted to promoting professionalism, civility, ethics, and legal skills amongst the American bench and bar, in a collegial setting, through continuing education and mentoring. At present, each major American city has more than one Inn of Court; for example, one Inn may be affiliated with a local law school, and another may be associated with a specific field of legal practice. American Inns of Court do not possess any real property. They are groups of judges, practicing attorneys, law professors and students who meet regularly (usually monthly) to discuss and debate issues relating to legal ethics and professionalism. American Inn of Court meetings typically consist of a shared meal and a programme presented by one of the Inn's pupillage teams. The U.S. does not require attorneys to be members of an Inn of Court, and many of the equivalent functions are performed by state bar associations. Some states require attorneys to belong to the official bar association, e.g., the State Bar of Michigan, while other states, such as Illinois, do not make membership of an official bar association a compulsory condition of licensure. Neither voluntary professional associations (including the American Inns of Court) nor mandatory bar associations typically have any role in training or licensing of law students that would be comparable to that function of the four English Inns of Court in selection and training of new barristers. While the American Inns of Court share a collegial relationship with the English Inns, there is no formal or legal relationship. A Declaration of Friendship was signed by the English and American Inns of Court, establishing visitation procedures under which American Inn members can acquire a letter of introduction that will officially introduce them to the Inns in England and Ireland, with reciprocal procedures available for English and Irish barristers. An annual six-week exchange program, known as the Pegasus Scholarships, was created to provide for young English barristers to travel to the United States, and young American Inn of Court members to travel to London, to learn about the legal system of the other jurisdiction.

Hood wrote regularly for The London Magazine, Athenaeum, and Punch. He later published a magazine largely consisting of his own works. Hood, never robust, had lapsed into invalidism by the age of 41 and died at the age of 45. William Michael Rossetti in 1903 called him \\"the finest English poet\\" between the generations of Shelley and Tennyson.Rossetti, W. M. Biographical Introduction, The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood. (London, 1903). Hood was the father of the playwright and humorist Tom Hood (1835‚Äì1874). Early life Plaque in Cheapside, City of London, marking the site of the house where Thomas Hood was born He was born in London to Thomas Hood and Elizabeth Sands in the Poultry (Cheapside) above his father's bookshop. Hood's paternal family had been Scottish farmers from the village of Errol near Dundee. The elder Hood was a partner in the business of Verner, Hood and Sharp, a member of the Associated Booksellers. Hood's son, Tom Hood, claimed that his grandfather had been the first to open up the book trade with America and he had great success with new editions of old books.J. C. Reid, p. 10. \\"Next to being a citizen of the world,\\" writes Thomas Hood in his Literary Reminiscences, \\"it must be the best thing to be born a citizen of the world's greatest city.\\" On the death of her husband in 1811, his mother moved to Islington, where Thomas Hood had a schoolmaster who in appreciating his talents, \\"made him feel it impossible not to take an interest in learning while he seemed so interested in teaching.\\" Under the care of this \\"decayed dominie\\", he earned a few guineas ‚Äì his first literary fee ‚Äì by revising for the press a new edition of the 1788 novel Paul and Virginia. Hood left his private schoolmaster at 14 years of age and was admitted soon after into the counting house of a friend of his family, where he \\"turned his stool into a Pegasus on three legs, every foot, of course, being a dactyl or a spondee.\\" However, the uncongenial profession affected his health, which was never strong, and he began to study engraving. The exact nature and course of his study is unclear: various sources tell different stories. Reid emphasizes his work under his maternal uncle Robert Sands,J. C. Reid, p. 19. but no deeds of apprenticeship exist and we also know from his letters that he studied with a Mr Harris. Hood's daughter in her Memorials mentions her father's association with the Le Keux brothers, who were successful engravers in the City.Memorials, p. 5. The labour of engraving was no better for his health than the counting house had been, and Hood was sent to his father's relations at Dundee, Scotland. There he stayed in the house of his maternal aunt, Jean Keay, for some months and then, on falling out with her, moved on to the boarding house of one of her friends, Mrs Butterworth, where he lived for the rest of his time in Scotland.His living situation in Dundee was pieced together by George Maxwell in Hood in Scotland. See particularly Chapter III. In Dundee, Hood made a number of close friends with whom he continued to correspond for many years. He led a healthy outdoor life but also became a wide and indiscriminate reader. During his time there, Hood began seriously to write poetry and appeared in print for the first time, with a letter to the editor of the Dundee Advertiser. Literary society Before long Hood was contributing humorous and poetical pieces to provincial newspapers and magazines. As a proof of his literary vocation, he would write out his poems in printed characters, believing that this process best enabled him to understand his own peculiarities and faults, and probably unaware that Samuel Taylor Coleridge had recommended some such method of criticism when he said he thought, \\"Print settles it.\\" On his return to London in 1818 he applied himself to engraving, which enabled him later to illustrate his various humours and fancies. In 1821, John Scott, editor of The London Magazine, was killed in a duel, and the periodical passed into the hands of some friends of Hood, who proposed to make him sub-editor. This post at once introduced him to the literary society of the time. In becoming an associate of John Hamilton Reynolds, Charles Lamb, Henry Cary, Thomas de Quincey, Allan Cunningham, Bryan Procter, Serjeant Talfourd, Hartley Coleridge, the peasant-poet John Clare and other contributors, he gradually developed his own powers. Family life Thomas Hood's wife, Jane Hood married in May 1824,In Memorials, p. 17, his daughter Francis gives the date of her parents' marriage as 5 May 1824. J. C. Reid, p. 67, on the other hand, gives 5 May of the following year. and Odes and Addresses ‚Äì his first volume ‚Äì was written in conjunction with his brother-in-law John Hamilton Reynolds, a friend of John Keats. Coleridge wrote to Lamb averring that the book must be the latter's work. Also from this period are The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies (1827) and a dramatic romance, Lamia, published later. The Plea was a book of serious verse, but Hood was known as a humorist and the book was ignored almost entirely. Hood was fond of practical jokes, which he was said to have enjoyed perpetrating on members of his family. In the Memorials there is a story of Hood instructing his wife to purchase some fish for the evening meal from a woman who regularly came to the door selling her husband's catch. But he warns her to watch for plaice that \\"has any appearance of red or orange spots, as they are a sure sign of an advanced stage of decomposition.\\" Mrs Hood refused to purchase the fish- seller's plaice, exclaiming, \\"My good woman... I could not think of buying any plaice with those very unpleasant red spots!\\" The fish-seller was amazed at such ignorance of what plaice look like.Memorials, pp. 23‚Äì24. The series of the Comic Annual, dating from 1830, was a kind of publication popular at that time, which Hood undertook and continued almost unassisted for several years. Under that title he treated all the leading events of the day in caricature, without personal malice, and with an undercurrent of sympathy. Readers were also treated to an incessant use of puns, of which Hood had written in his own vindication, \\"However critics may take offence,/A double meaning has double sense\\", but as he gained experience as a writer, his diction became simpler. Later writings In another annual called the Gem appeared the verse story of Eugene Aram. Hood started a magazine in his own name, which was mainly sustained by his own activity. He conducted the work from a sick-bed from which he never rose, and there also composed well-known poems such as \\"The Song of the Shirt\\", which appeared anonymously in the Christmas number of Punch, 1843 and was immediately reprinted in The Times and other newspapers across Europe. It was dramatised by Mark Lemon as The Sempstress, printed on broadsheets and cotton handkerchiefs, and was highly praised by many of the literary establishment, including Charles Dickens. Likewise \\"The Bridge of Sighs\\" and \\"The Song of the Labourer\\", which were also translated into German by Ferdinand Freiligrath. These are plain, solemn pictures of conditions of life, which appeared shortly before Hood's own death in May 1845. Hood was associated with the Athenaeum, started in 1828 by James Silk Buckingham, and he was a regular contributor for the rest of his life. Prolonged illness brought on straitened circumstances. Application was made by a number of Hood's friends to the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel to grant Hood a civil list pension, with which the British state rewarded literary men. Peel was known to be an admirer of Hood's work and in the last few months of Hood's life he gave Jane Hood the sum of ¬£100 without her husband's knowledge to alleviate the family's debts.Clubbe, p. 181. The pension that Peel's government bestowed on Hood was continued to his wife and family after his death. Jane Hood, who also suffered from poor health and had expended tremendous energy tending to her husband in his last year, died only 18 months later. The pension then ceased, but Peel's successor Lord John Russell, grandfather of the philosopher Bertrand Russell, made arrangements for a ¬£50 pension for the maintenance of Hood's two children, Frances and Tom.Clubbe, p. 196. Nine years later, a monument raised by public subscription in Kensal Green Cemetery was unveiled by Richard Monckton Milnes. Thackeray, a friend of Hood's, gave this assessment of him: \\"Oh sad, marvellous picture of courage, of honesty, of patient endurance, of duty struggling against pain! ... Here is one at least without guile, without pretension, without scheming, of a pure life, to his family and little modest circle of friends tenderly devoted.\\"J. C. Reid, p. 235. The house where Hood died, No. 28 Finchley Road, in the St John's Wood area of London, now has a blue plaque. Examples of his works Hood wrote humorously on many contemporary issues. One of the most important issues in his time was grave robbing and selling of corpses to anatomists (see West Port murders). On this serious and perhaps cruel issue, he wrote wryly, > Don't go to weep upon my grave, > And think that there I be. > They haven't left an atom there > Of my anatomie. November in London is usually cool and overcast, and in Hood's day subject to frequent fog and smog. In 1844 he wrote, > No sun ‚Äì no moon! > No morn ‚Äì no noon ‚Äì > No dawn ‚Äì no dusk ‚Äì no proper time of day. > No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease, > No comfortable feel in any member ‚Äì > No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees, > No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds ‚Äì > November! An example of Hood's reflective and sentimental verse is the famous \\"I Remember, I Remember\\", excerpted here: > I remember, I remember > The house where I was born, > The little window where the sun > Came peeping in at morn; > He never came a wink too soon > Nor brought too long a day; > But now, I often wish the night > Had borne my breath away. I remember, I remember > The roses, red and white, > The violets, and the lily-cups > Those flowers made of light! > The lilacs where the robin built, > And where my brother set > The laburnum on his birth-day, > The tree is living yet! I remember, I remember > Where I used to swing, > And thought the air must rush as fresh > To swallows on the wing; > My spirit flew in feathers then > That is so heavy now, > And summer pools could hardly cool > The fever on my brow. I remember, I remember > The fir trees dark and high; > I used to think their slender tops > Were close against the sky: > It was childish ignorance, > But now 'tis little joy > To know I'm farther off from Heaven > Than when I was a boy. Hood's most widely known work during his lifetime was \\"The Song of the Shirt\\", a verse lament for a London seamstress compelled to sell shirts she had made, the proceeds of which lawfully belonged to her employer, in order to feed her malnourished and ailing child. Hood's poem appeared in one of the first editions of Punch in 1843 and quickly became a public sensation, being turned into a popular song and inspiring social activists in defence of countless industrious labouring women living in abject poverty. An excerpt: > With fingers weary and worn, > With eyelids heavy and red, > A woman sat, in unwomanly rags, > Plying her needle and thread-- > Stitch! stitch! stitch! > In poverty, hunger, and dirt, > And still with a voice of dolorous pitch > She sang the \\"Song of the Shirt.\\" \\"Work! work! work! > While the cock is crowing aloof! > And work‚Äîwork‚Äîwork, > Till the stars shine through the roof! > It's Oh! to be a slave > Along with the barbarous Turk, > Where woman has never a soul to save, > If this is Christian work!\\" Modern references *Metro-Land ‚Äì John Betjeman (1973) *\\"Opus 4\\" ‚Äì The Art of Noise (album: In Visible Silence, 1986) *The Piano ‚Äì Jane Campion (1993) *So Much Blood ‚Äì Simon Brett (1976) Works by Thomas Hood The list of Hood's separately published works is as follows: *Odes and Addresses to Great People (1825) *Whims and Oddities (two series, 1826 and 1827) *The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies, hero and Leander, Lycus the Centaur and other Poems (1827), his only collection of serious verse *The Epping Hunt illustrated by George Cruikshank (1829) *The Dream of Eugene Aram, the Murderer (1831) *Tylney Hall, a novel (3 vols., 1834) *The Comic Annual (1830‚Äì1842) *Hood's Own, or, Laughter from Year to Year (1838, second series, 1861) *Up the Rhine (1840) *Hood's Magazine and Comic Miscellany (1844‚Äì1848) *National Tales (2 vols., 1837), a collection of short novelettes, including \\"The Three Jewels\\". *Whimsicalities (1844), with illustrations from John Leech's designs *Many contributions to contemporary periodicals.

Although Herbert enjoyed important careers as a cello soloist and conductor, he is best known for composing many successful operettas that premiered on Broadway from the 1890s to World War I. He was also prominent among the Tin Pan Alley composers and was later a founder of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). A prolific composer, Herbert produced two operas, a cantata, 43 operettas, incidental music to 10 plays, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions and numerous songs, choral compositions and orchestrations of works by other composers, among other music. In the early 1880s, Herbert began a career as a cellist in Vienna, Austria, and Stuttgart, Germany, during which he began to compose orchestral music. Herbert and his opera singer wife, Therese F√∂rster, moved to the U.S. in 1886 when both were engaged by the Metropolitan Opera. In the U.S., Herbert continued his performing career, while also teaching at the National Conservatory of Music, conducting and composing. His most notable instrumental compositions were his Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30 (1894), which entered the standard repertoire,\\"Sullivan's only concerto a classic\\", The Los Angeles Daily News, March 13, 1987, reprinted at julianlloydwebber.com and his Auditorium Festival March (1901). He led the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1898 to 1904 and then founded the Victor Herbert Orchestra, which he conducted throughout the rest of his life. Herbert began to compose operettas in 1894, producing several successes, including The Serenade (1897) and The Fortune Teller (1898). Some of the operettas that he wrote after the turn of the 20th century were even more successful: Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle. Modiste (1905), The Red Mill (1906), Naughty Marietta (1910), Sweethearts (1913) and Eileen (1917). After World War I, with the change of popular musical tastes, Herbert began to compose musicals and contributed music to other composers' shows. While some of these were well-received, he never again achieved the level of success that he had enjoyed with his most popular operettas.

In Stuttgart he received a strong liberal education at the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium, which included musical training. Herbert initially planned to pursue a career as a medical doctor. Although his stepfather was related by blood to the German royal family, his financial situation was not good by the time Herbert was a teenager. Medical education in Germany was expensive, and so Herbert focused instead on music.Mott, Alyce. \\"Victor Herbert ‚Äì The Early Years\\", Victor Herbert Renaissance Project website, March 8, 2008, accessed March 16, 2011 He initially studied the piano, flute and piccolo but ultimately settled on the cello, beginning studies on that instrument with Bernhard Cossmann from age 15 to age 18.Waters, p. 7Kaye, pp. 25‚Äì26 He then attended the Stuttgart Conservatory. After studying cello, music theory and composition under Max Seifritz, Herbert graduated with a diploma in 1879.Ledbetter, Steven. \\"Victor Herbert\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy, accessed February 11, 2009 =Early career and the move to the U.S.= Concert poster for Eduard Strauss's orchestra Even before studying with Cossmann, Herbert was engaged professionally as a player in concerts in Stuttgart. His first orchestra position was as a flute and piccolo player, but he soon turned solely to the cello. By the time he was 19, Herbert had received engagements as a soloist with several major German orchestras. He played in the orchestra of the wealthy Russian Baron Paul von Derwies for a few years and, in 1880, was a soloist for a year in the orchestra of Eduard Strauss in Vienna. Herbert joined the court orchestra in Stuttgart in 1881, where he remained for the next five years. There he composed his first pieces of instrumental music, playing the solos in the premieres of his first two large-scale works, the Suite for cello and orchestra, Op. 3 (1883) and the Cello Concerto No. 1, Op. 8. In 1883, Herbert was selected by Johannes Brahms to play in a chamber orchestra for the celebration of the life of Franz Liszt, then 72 years old, near Zurich. In 1885 Herbert became romantically involved with Therese F√∂rster (1861‚Äì1927), a soprano who had recently joined the court opera for which the court orchestra played. F√∂rster sang several leading roles at the Stuttgart Opera in 1885 through the summer of 1886. After a year of courtship, the couple married on August 14, 1886. On October 24, 1886, they moved to the United States, as they both had been hired by Walter Damrosch and Anton Seidl to join the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Herbert was engaged as the opera orchestra's principal cellist, and F√∂rster was engaged to sing principal roles with the Met. During the voyage to America, Herbert and his wife became friends with their fellow passenger and future conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Anton Seidl, and other singers joining the Met.Herbert, Victor. Anton Seidl: a memorial by his friends, ed. Henry Theophilus Finck, C. Scribner's Sons, 1899, pp. 123‚Äì25, accessed November 4, 2009 =Initial musical life in New York City= Seidl became an important mentor to Herbert and took a particular interest in fostering Herbert's skills as a conductor. Upon arriving in New York, Herbert and F√∂rster became active members of New York's German music community, socializing and networking at cafes such as Luchow's. At these cafes, Herbert handed out business cards saying, \\"solo cellist from the Royal Orchestra of his Majesty, the King of Wurtemberg. Instructor in cello, vocal music and harmony.\\"Mott, Alyce. \\"Setting the Stage in America\\", Victor Herbert Renaissance Project website, March 8, 2008, accessed November 9, 2009 Herbert hoped to pick up extra income teaching, since he was earning only $40 to $50 a week as a cellist in the Met's orchestra. Meanwhile, in her first season at the Met, 1886‚Äì87, F√∂rster sang several roles in German, including the title role of the Queen of Sheba in Goldmark's Die K√∂nigin von Saba, Elsa in Lohengrin, Irene in Wagner's Rienzi, the title role in the Met premiere of Verdi's Aida and Elizabeth in Tannh√§user. She earned praise from critics and audiences alike and was featured on the cover of the Musical Courier, a major music magazine of the day. The next season, she repeated the role of Elsa but then left the Met and then sang with the German-language Thalia Theatre, again earning good reviews. Although she sang for several more years, her career did not progress. Nevertheless, happy in New York, Herbert and F√∂rster decided to remain in America after their first season at the Metropolitan Opera and eventually became citizens.Waters, p. 234 Anton Seidl, Herbert's mentor and friend Herbert quickly became prominent in New York City's musical scene, making his first American solo appearance on the cello in a performance of his own Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3, with Walter Damrosch conducting the Symphony Society of New York at the Metropolitan Opera House on January 8, 1887. The New York Herald said of the event, \\"[Herbert's] style is infinitely more easy and graceful than that of most cello players\\". This warm reception quickly led to more solo engagements that year, including performances of his own Berceuse and Polonais. Herbert continued to appear as a cello soloist with major American orchestras into the 1910s. In the fall of 1887, he formed his own 40-piece orchestra, the Majestic Orchestra Internationale, which he conducted and in which he served as cello soloist. Although the orchestra survived for only one season, it performed in several of New York's most important concert halls. The same year, he founded the New York String Quartet together with violinists Sam Franko and Henry Boewig, and violist Ludwig Schenck. The group's first concert was on December 8, 1887, and it continued to give free- admittance concerts for several years at Steinway Hall, earning enthusiastic critical praise.Waters, pp. 39‚Äì40 During the Summer of 1888, Herbert became Seidl's assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic's ten-week summer concert seasons on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach, a prestigious post. Seidl's concert seasons made Brighton Beach an important New York musical venue each summer. Herbert conducted the 80-piece orchestra in lighter works paired with more serious repertoire at summer concerts and festivals over the next few years. Herbert's association with the New York Philharmonic ended in 1898, after eleven seasons, serving variously as an assistant conductor, guest conductor and solo cellist. In Fall 1888, soprano Emma Juchs hired Herbert to music direct a \\"concert party\\" tour of cities and towns in the midwest that had seen little art music, presenting a quartet of singers in varied programs of songs, operatic scenes and arias to new audiences. The accompaniment was usually pianist Adele Aus de Ohe and Herbert at the cello. The group presented their concerts to wealthy patrons at fashionable private parties and at mostly smaller venues to local audiences, educating them about opera, art songs and contemporary music. =Conducting and composing successes= On December 1, 1888, Seidl programmed Herbert's Serenade for String Orchestra, Op. 12 as part of a concert at Steinway Hall, with the composer conducting. In January 1889, Herbert and violinist Max Bendix were the soloists in the American premiere of the challenging Double Concerto, Op. 102 for Violin, Cello and Orchestra by Brahms. Conductor Theodore Thomas then invited Herbert to conduct and perform with him in Chicago. In 1889, Herbert formed the Metropolitan Trio Club with Bendix and pianist Reinhold L. Herman. The Musical Courier gave effusive praise to both Herbert's compositions (\\"refined taste, abundant melodic invention\\") and his playing: \\"As a violoncellist, Mr. Herbert ranks with the foremost alive\\". Seidl brought Herbert, F√∂rster, Bendix, Juchs, Ohe and Lilli Lehmann, together with a large orchestra and 500-voice chorus, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in May 1889 as part of a big music festival to celebrate the new Exposition Building. Herbert also played and conducted for the Worcester Music Festival, where he returned repeatedly through the 1890s. In the autumn of 1889, Herbert also joined the faculty of the National Conservatory of Music, where he taught cello and music composition for several years. In 1890, he was appointed the conductor of the Boston Festival Orchestra, serving there in seasons through 1893, in addition to all of his conducting commitments elsewhere.Waters, p. 57 In 1891, Herbert premiered an ambitious cantata, The Captive, for solo voices, chorus and full orchestra. His Irish Rhapsody (1892), written for the Gaelic Society of New York enjoyed a brief but intense period of popularity. He became director of the 22nd Regimental Band of the New York National Guard in 1894, succeeding its founder, Patrick Gilmore and Gilmore's unsuccessful immediate successor David Wallis Reeves. Herbert toured widely with the 22nd Regimental Band through 1900, performing both his own band compositions and works from the orchestral repertory that he transcribed for the band.Gould, pp. 66‚Äì83 Beginning in 1894, when he began composing operettas, Herbert's band marches were sometimes derived from material from the operettas. Throughout his career, Herbert was well liked by orchestra players for his modesty and unpretentiousness. Herbert continued to compose orchestral music, writing one of his finest works, the Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30, which premiered in 1894. In 1898, Herbert became the principal conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony, a position he held until 1904. Under his leadership, the orchestra became a major American ensemble and was favorably compared by music critics with ensembles like the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra toured to several major cities during Herbert's years as conductor, notably premiering Herbert's Auditorium Festival March for the celebration of the twelfth anniversary of Chicago's Auditorium Theatre in 1901. After a disagreement with the management of the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1904, Herbert resigned, founding the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He conducted their programs of light orchestral music paired with more serious repertoire (as he had done earlier with Anton Seidl's Brighton Beach orchestra concerts) at summer resorts and on tours for most of his remaining years. His orchestra made many acoustical recordings for both Edison Records, from 1909 to 1911, and the Victor Talking Machine Company, from 1911 to 1923. Herbert was also a cello soloist in several Victor recordings as well.Waters, p. 405 =Activist for the legal rights of composers= In the early years of the twentieth century, Herbert championed the right of composers to profit from their works. In 1909, he testified before the United States Congress, influencing the formation and development of the Copyright Act of 1909. This law helped to secure the rights of composers to charge royalties on the sales of sound recordings. A photo from the original 1894 production of Prince Ananias, Herbert's first operetta. Herbert led a group of composers and publishers in founding the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) on February 13, 1914,Billboard, February 16, 1974, p. 10 becoming its vice-president and director until his death in 1924. The organization has historically worked to protect the rights of songwriters and music publishers and continues to do this work today. In 1917, Herbert won a landmark lawsuit before the United States Supreme Court that gave composers, through ASCAP, a right to charge performance fees for the public performance of their music.Victor Herbert profile at the Songwriters' Hall of Fame website, accessed November 11, 2009 ASCAP commissioned a bust in Herbert's honor in New York City's Central Park, erected in 1927.\\"Victor Herbert Statue: Central Park\\", NYC Parks Dept. website, accessed November 11, 2009 =Operetta, opera and musical theatre= In 1894 Herbert composed his first operetta, Prince Ananias, for a popular troupe known as The Bostonians. The piece was well received, and Herbert soon composed three more operettas for Broadway, The Wizard of the Nile (1895), The Serenade (1897), which enjoyed international success, and The Fortune Teller (1898), starring Alice Nielsen. Although these achieved popularity, Herbert did not produce any more stage works for several years, focusing on his work with the Pittsburgh Symphony until 1904. Just before leaving that orchestra, he returned to Broadway with his first major hit, Babes in Toyland (1903). Two more successes followed, Mlle. Modiste (1905) and The Red Mill (1906), which solidified Herbert as one of the best-known American composers. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1908.Waters, p. 315 Sheet music for the title song from Sweethearts Although Herbert's reputation lies with his operettas, he also composed two grand operas. He searched for several years for a libretto that appealed to him, finally finding one by Joseph D. Redding called Natoma that concerned a historical story set in California. He composed the work from 1909 to 1910, and it premiered in Philadelphia on February 25, 1911 with soprano Mary Garden in the title role and the young Irish tenor John McCormack in his American operatic debut. Herbert's score was well received, and the opera was repeated as part of the company's repertory during the next three seasons. It also enjoyed performances in New York City, making its debut there on February 28, 1911. Herbert's other opera, Madeleine, was a much lighter work in one act.Vocal score for Madeleine, adapted from the French of Decourcelles & Thibaut by Grant Stewart. On January 24, 1914, it had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, but it was not revived beyond that season.Waters, p. 399 During this period, Herbert continued to compose operettas, producing two of his most successful works, Naughty Marietta (1910) and Sweethearts (1913). He also became progressively more involved with Irish- American organizations: in 1908 he joined the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick (becoming president in 1916), the oldest Irish association in New York, and in 1911 he became a member of the American Irish Historical Society. In early 1916, he became the founding president of the Friends of Irish Freedom and became active in the cause of Irish nationalism. Another operetta, Eileen (1917, originally entitled Hearts of Erin), was the fulfillment of Herbert's desire to compose an Irish-themed operetta and a tribute to his grandfather's novel Rory O'More. The piece is set during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and contains a rich score; it debuted in time to mark the first anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland. This was the end of Herbert's greatest period of producing full scores for operettas. In late 1916 Herbert also orchestrated \\"Soldiers of Erin\\",\\"Soldiers of Erin\\", Irish Sheet Music Archives, accessed July 14, 2019 an English language version of what would later be adopted as the Irish national anthem; it was widely performed in the US from early 1917. Herbert at the height of his success By World War I, with the birth of jazz, ragtime and new dance styles like the foxtrot and tango, Herbert reluctantly switched to writing musical comedies. These featured less elaborate ensembles and simpler songs for less classically trained singers than the European-style operettas that had dominated his earlier career. Herbert, during the last years of his career, was frequently asked to compose ballet music for the elaborate production numbers in Broadway revues and the shows of Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern, among others. He was also a contributor to the Ziegfeld Follies every year from 1917 to 1924.Gould, p. 567Waters, p. 591 Death and legacy A healthy man throughout his life, Herbert died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 65 on May 26, 1924 shortly after his final show, The Dream Girl, began its pre-Broadway run in New Haven, Connecticut.Gould, p. 521 He was survived by his wife and two children, Ella Victoria Herbert Bartlett and Clifford Victor Herbert.Tubb, Benjamin Robert. \\"The Music of Victor August Herbert\\", PD Music site (2007)Victor Herbert at the NNDB website, accessed November 11, 2009 He was entombed in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.Victor Herbert at Findagrave, accessed November 11, 2009 Herbert and his music are celebrated in the 1939 film The Great Victor Herbert, where he was portrayed by Walter Connolly and which also featured Mary Martin.The Great Victor Herbert at the Mary Martin website He was also portrayed by Paul Maxey in the 1946 film Till the Clouds Roll By.

He also composed The Fall of a Nation (1916), one of the first original orchestral scores for a full-length film. The score was thought to be lost, but it turned up in the film-music collection of the Library of Congress. It was given a recording in 1987. As a composer, Herbert is chiefly remembered for his operettas. Of his instrumental works, only a few remained consistently within the concert repertoire after Herbert's death. However, some of his forgotten works have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity within the last couple decades.Gould, p. 530 =Operettas and other stage music= A \\"toy soldier\\" from the original 1903 production of Babes in Toyland, Herbert's first major success.

As Broadway increasingly became essential to commercial theatrical success, Herbert designed his shows to appeal specifically to New York sensibilities. Although consistently praised for his music, many of Herbert's operettas were criticized by theatre critics for their weak librettos and conventional lyrics.Waters, p. 574 By the mid-20th century, revivals of Herbert's works were relatively rare. His shows were revived occasionally on Broadway until 1947, but not thereafter.\\"Victor Herbert\\" at the IBDB database, accessed November 4, 2009 In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the operettas began to be revived more frequently, albeit often with heavily rewritten librettos, by companies like the Light Opera of Manhattan and Ohio Light Opera, and revivals continue today.See, e.g., Light Opera of New York website , noting productions of Herbert operettas in 2010 =Herbert's style= American musical theatre composers of the late nineteenth century tended to imitate either Viennese operetta or the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Many American theatre companies, such as The Bostonians, were established for the purpose of performing Gilbert and Sullivan's operas, such as H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado, and adaptations of Karl Mill√∂cker's operettas, such as Der Bettelstudent, or Franz von Supp√©'s Boccaccio, all of which became popular in America. Herbert tailored his operettas to be performed by companies that performed these works. His background made him intimately familiar with Viennese operetta. Indeed, the most characteristic Herbert song was the waltz, and many of his waltzes became highly popular in spite of their high musical demands. The Fortune Teller drum corps Herbert is also known for his \\"variation\\" songs, which consist either of a series of refrains displaying different styles, or of several variations of the same melody. For example, \\"Serenades of All Nations\\" from The Fortune Teller demonstrates serenades from colourful national traditions, sung and danced by a ballerina. \\"The Song of the Poet\\" from Babes in Toyland provides variations on the lullaby \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\" by presenting it first as a brassy march, then in Neapolitan style, and finally as a cakewalk. The best of Herbert's operetta music is challenging, calling for trained singers. He often wrote his operettas with a particular singer in mind. During his career he had occasion to work with three great prima donnas: Alice Nielsen, Fritzi Scheff, and Emma Trentini. For them, he wrote leading parts in The Fortune Teller and The Singing Girl (Nielsen), Babette, Mlle. Modiste, The Prima Donna and Mlle Rosita (Scheff), and Naughty Marietta (Trentini). He would also write shows for popular comedians of the day or noted producers. Some of these were spectacular successes (The Red Mill, written for the comedy team of David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone, was Herbert's most financially successful show.Waters, p. 302), while others were dismal failures (When Sweet Sixteen, written for Joe Weber, who pulled out of the production, which lasted only twelve performances on Broadway.Waters, p. 366). Although Herbert had not been exposed to Gilbert and Sullivan before his arrival in the U.S. in 1886, their popularity led him to adopt some of their musical and dramatic sensibilities. An example of this is the quintet \\"Cleopatra's Wedding Day\\" from The Wizard of the Nile.Gould, p. 238 One of his early successes, The Serenade, borrows many of its situations from Ruddigore, Iolanthe and The Pirates of Penzance. The work's librettist, Harry B. Smith, went on to steal more Gilbertian ideas for future operettas with Herbert, who often would complement these ideas with music reminiscent of Sullivan. The Singing Girl, co-written by Smith and Stanislaus Stange, recalls The Mikado, and includes the plot element of a law against kissing without a licence.Gould, p. 302 Sheet music from The Red Mill Herbert tended to use a slightly larger orchestra than Sullivan did in his comic operas, mostly through use of more types of percussion and occasionally by adding a harp. He generally wrote his own orchestrations, which were admired by music critics and other composers. In revivals of his works, however, new orchestrations have substituted saxophones and brass for strings. For many years, the only recording available of a Herbert show using his original orchestrations was one of Naughty Marietta, produced by the Smithsonian in 1981.Smithsonian LP label N 026 Only recently have more recordings of his operettas appeared with the original orchestrations intact. These include Naughty Marietta, Mlle. Modiste, Eileen, Sweethearts and The Red Mill by Ohio Light OperaOhio Light Opera Gift Shop and The Fortune Teller by The Comic Opera Guild, which also has recorded numerous Herbert operettas live in concert with two-piano accompaniment.The Comic Opera Guild Recordings Like Sullivan, Herbert also frequently evokes and imitates music from distant places in his operettas. He uses elements of Spanish music in The Serenade, Italian music in Naughty Marietta, Austrian music in The Singing Girl and Eastern music in The Wizard of the Nile, The Idol's Eye, The Tattooed Man and other works set in places like Egypt and India. The Fortune Teller includes an energetic Hungarian cs√°rd√°s. He also frequently interpolated Irish-style songs into his operettas which, with the exception of those in Eileen, rarely advanced the plot.Purdy, pp. 41‚Äì49 By World War I, musical tastes were shifting in America, and Herbert was forced to compose in a simpler musical style. Many of his later works, such as The Velvet Lady and Angel Face (both 1919), imitated popular new song- types like the foxtrot, ragtime and the tango.IBDB entry on The Velvet LadyIBDB entry on Angel Face Even in some of his earlier works, such as The Red Mill (1906), Herbert was already adopting elements that would later become associated with musical comedy in America. His collaboration on The Century Girl (1916) with Irving Berlin displayed this simpler style. Although these later shows introduced some memorable numbers, they did not enjoy the enduring popularity of his most popular operettas. The most successful work of his later career was Orange Blossoms (1921),IBDB entry on Orange BlossomsVocal score for Orange Blossoms which included the popular waltz song, \\"A Kiss in the Dark\\".Waters, p. 501 =Operas= Mary Garden in the title role of Natoma Although his success had been in light music, like Sullivan, Herbert aspired to compose serious operas. Approached by Oscar Hammerstein I to write a grand opera, Herbert jumped at the chance. Hammerstein announced, in the April 13, 1907 issue of Musical America, a $1,000 prize for the best libretto submitted, fueling public enthusiasm and high expectations. Joseph Redding's libretto for Natoma, set in 1820s California, is a love story between an American naval officer and a Native American princess. The cast included such distinguished singers as John McCormack and Mary Garden, but the 1911 premiere in Philadelphia was only a moderate success. Critics praised the music, including its effective melodies and leitmotifs set off by orchestral counterpoint. They complained, however, about the libretto and the casting of foreign singers in what was supposed to be an \\"American opera\\".Gould, p. 416 Madeleine, his only other opera, is based on a French play and tells the equable little story of an operatic prima donna whose friends and acquaintances, one by one, decline her invitation to dine with her on New Years Day. The work is in one act and premiered in 1914 in a double bill with Enrico Caruso in the leading tenor role in Pagliacci. The opera featured Frances Alda in the title role. It failed to make an impression and received only six performances. Its conversational style is complemented by orchestral motivic commentary. Just before the work opened, Herbert added \\"A Perfect Day\\" at Alda's request. Although not a success, because of Herbert's popularity, G. Schirmer took the unprecedented step of publishing the work in full score. =Instrumental music= After Herbert's death, little of his instrumental music continued to be performed, but within the last couple of decades it has begun to enjoy revivals in concert and recordings. His Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30, is an exception to this. First performed in 1894, it was received enthusiastically at its premiere and shows the influence of Franz Liszt. Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, a colleague of Herbert's at the National Conservatory, was inspired to compose his Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104, after hearing its premiere.Purdy, p. 115 The concerto has been recorded by cellists such as Yo- Yo Ma (with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic), Lynn Harrell (with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields), Julian Lloyd Webber (with Sir Charles Mackerras and the London Symphony Orchestra),Cello Concerto no. 2 review and an early rare recording by Bernard Greenhouse (with Max Sch√∂nherr and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra).American Recording Society ARS-111, 1953 180px More recently, two of Herbert's earlier compositions for cello and orchestra have regained a place in the concert repertory. The Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3 (1884), his earliest known composition despite its designation as Op. 3, has been performed by several ensembles in recent years. The work foreshadows the light music of Herbert's later compositions. Another work that has been revived is his Cello Concerto No. 1, which was first performed by the composer in Stuttgart shortly before he came to the U.S. For many years, the work was unpublished and apparently unperformed, surviving only in manuscript. It was recorded for the first time in 1986 and has since been published. The composition is admired for achieving an effective balance between its virtuosic elements and its lyricism. Of his large-scale orchestral works, Herbert's tone poem Hero and Leander (1901) is his most important. Composed for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra while Herbert was their conductor, the work displays an affinity with both Wagner and Liszt. Another important work that Herbert wrote for the PSO is Columbus, Op. 35, a four-movement programmatic suite. The first and final movements of the suite were composed in 1893 as part of a theatrical spectacle intended for the Colombian Exposition in Chicago. However, Herbert never completed that project, and the central two movements were not composed until 1902. The PSO premiered the work in 1903, and it was the last large-scale symphonic work that Herbert composed.Waters, p. 237 Herbert also composed a considerable body of smaller-scale works, often writing music for his own performance on the cello or producing individual songs for the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He published some of his dance music compositions under the pseudonym Noble MacClure.Purdy, p. 211 During the last decade of his life, he composed a number of overtures for feature films, although The Fall of a Nation was his only complete film score. On February 12, 1924, Herbert was one of the featured composers at New York's Aeolian Hall, in an evening entitled An Experiment in Modern Music that included the world premiere of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue by the Paul Whiteman orchestra.Wood, p. 81Jablonski, Edward. \\"Glorious George\\", Cigar Aficionado January/February 1999 Herbert's contribution for the evening, A Suite of Serenades, was his last work to premiere with him in attendance.

The liquorice plant is a herbaceous perennial legume native to the Western Asia and southern Europe. It is not botanically related to anise, star anise or fennel, which are sources of similar flavouring compounds. Liquorice is used as a flavouring in candies and tobacco, particularly in some European and West Asian countries. Liquorice extracts have been used in herbalism and traditional medicine. Excessive consumption of liquorice (more than 2 mg/kg/day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a liquorice component) may result in adverse effects, such as hypokalemia, increased blood pressure, and muscle weakness.  Etymology  The word \\"liquorice\\" is derived (via the Old French licoresse) from the Greek Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œåœÅŒπŒ∂Œ± (glykorrhiza), meaning \\"sweet root\\",Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œåœÅŒπŒ∂Œ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus from Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œçœÇ (glukus), \\"sweet\\"Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œçœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and œÅŒØŒ∂Œ± (rhiza), \\"root\\",·ø•ŒØŒ∂Œ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus<liquorice, on Oxford Dictionaries the name provided by Dioscorides.google books Maud Grieve, Manya Marshall - A modern herbal: the medicinal, culinary, cosmetic and economic properties, cultivation and folk- lore of herbs, grasses, fungi, shrubs, & trees with all their modern scientific uses, Volume 2 Dover Publications, 1982 & Pharmacist's Guide to Medicinal Herbs Arthur M. Presser Smart Publications, 1 April 2001 2012-05-19 It is spelled \\"liquorice\\" in most of the Commonwealth, but \\"licorice\\" in Canada as well as the United States.  Description  Liquorice is a herbaceous perennial, growing to in height, with pinnate leaves about long, with 9‚Äì17 leaflets. The flowers are long, purple to pale whitish blue, produced in a loose inflorescence. The fruit is an oblong pod, long, containing several seeds.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. The roots are stoloniferous.Brown, D., ed. (1995). \\"The RHS encyclopedia of herbs and their uses\\".  Chemistry  Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin The scent of liquorice root comes from a complex and variable combination of compounds, of which anethole is up to 3% of total volatiles. Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30‚Äì50 times the sweetness of sugar. The sweetness is very different from sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer. The isoflavene glabrene and the isoflavane glabridin, found in the roots of liquorice, are phytoestrogens.  Cultivation and uses  Liquorice, which grows best in well-drained soils in deep valleys with full sun, is harvested in the autumn two to three years after planting. Countries producing liquorice include India, Iran, Italy, Afghanistan, the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Pakistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Turkey.M & F Worldwide Corp., Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2010. The world's leading manufacturer of liquorice products is M&F; Worldwide, which manufactures more than 70% of the worldwide liquorice flavours sold to end users.M & F Worldwide Corp., Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2001. =Tobacco= Liquorice is used as a flavouring agent for tobacco for flavour enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco.Erik Assadourian, Cigarette Production Drops , Vital Signs 2005, at 70. Liquorice provides tobacco products with a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour that blends readily with the natural and imitation flavouring components employed in the tobacco industry. As of 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of any \\"characterizing flavors\\" other than menthol from cigarettes, but not other manufactured tobacco products. =Food and confectionery= Dried sticks of liquorice root Liquorice flavour is found in a wide variety of candies or sweets. In most of these candies, the taste is reinforced by aniseed oil so the actual content of liquorice is very low. Liquorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in Europe, but are also popular in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand. In the Netherlands, liquorice confectionery (drop) is one of the most popular forms of sweets. It is sold in many forms. Mixing it with mint, menthol, aniseed, or laurel is quite popular. Mixing it with ammonium chloride (salmiak) is also popular as it is in Finland. A popular example of salmiak liquorice in the Netherlands is known as zoute drop (salty liquorice), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride. the online Dutch food composition database] Strong, salty sweets are also popular in Nordic countries where liquorice flavoured alcohols are also popular, particularly in Denmark and Finland. Dried sticks of the liquorice root are also a traditional confectionery in their own right in the Netherlands as were they once in Britain although their popularity has waned in recent decades. They were sold simply as sticks of zoethout ('sweet wood') to chew on as a candy. Through chewing and suckling, the intensely sweet flavour is released. The sweetness is 30 to 50 times as strong as sucrose, without causing damage to teeth. Since about the 1970s, zoethout has become rarer and been replaced by easier to consume candies (including 'drop'). Pontefract in Yorkshire, England, was the first place where liquorice mixed with sugar began to be used as a sweet in the same way it is today. Pontefract cakes were originally made there. In County Durham, Yorkshire and Lancashire, it is colloquially known as 'Spanish', supposedly because Spanish monks grew liquorice root at Rievaulx Abbey near Thirsk. In Italy (particularly in the south), Spain and France, liquorice is popular in its natural form. The root of the plant is simply dug up, washed, dried, and chewed as a mouth freshener. Throughout Italy, unsweetened liquorice is consumed in the form of small black pieces made only from 100% pure liquorice extract. In Calabria a popular liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract. Liquorice is used in Syria and Egypt, where it is sold as a drink, in shops as well as street vendors. Liquorice root chips =Research= Properties of glycyrrhizin are under preliminary research, such as for hepatitis C or topical treatment of psoriasis, but the low quality of studies as of 2017 prevents conclusions about efficacy and safety. =Traditional medicine= In traditional Chinese medicine, a related species G. uralensis (often translated as \\"liquorice\\") is known as \\"gancao\\" (), and is believed to \\"harmonize\\" the ingredients in a formula. Liquorice has been used in Ayurveda in the belief it may treat various diseases, although there is no high-quality clinical research to indicate it is safe or effective for any medicinal purpose. =Toxicity= Its major dose-limiting toxicities are corticosteroid in nature, because of the inhibitory effect that its chief active constituents, glycyrrhizin and enoxolone, have on cortisol degradation, and include edema, hypokalaemia, weight gain or loss, and hypertension. The United States Food and Drug Administration believes that foods containing liquorice and its derivatives (including glycyrrhizin) are safe if not consumed excessively. Other jurisdictions have suggested no more than 100 mg to 200 mg of glycyrrhizin per day, the equivalent of about of liquorice confectionery. Liquorice should not be used during pregnancy. Liquorice poisoning Liquorice is an extract from the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant which contains glycyrrhizic acid, or GZA. GZA is made of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid. The extracts from the root of the plant can also be referred to as liquorice, sweet root, and glycyrrhiza extract. G. glabra grows in subtropical climates in Europe and Western Asia. When administered orally, the product of glycyrrhetic acid is found in human urine whereas GZA is not. This shows that glycyrrhetic acid is absorbed and metabolized in the intestines in humans. GZA is hydrolyzed to glycyrrhetic acid in the intestines by bacteria. For thousands of years G. glabra has been used for medicinal purposes including indigestion and stomach inflammation. Some other medicinal purposes are cough suppression, ulcer treatment, and use as a laxative. Also, salts of GZA can be used in many products as sweeteners and aromatizers. The major use of liquorice goes towards the tobacco industry, at roughly 90% of usage. The rest is split evenly between food and pharmaceutics, at 5% of usage each (Federal Register, 1983). Liquorice extract is often found in sweets and many candies, some drugs, and beverages like root beer. It can also be used in chewing gum, tobacco products like snuff, and toothpaste. An increase in intake of liquorice can cause many toxic effects. Hyper-mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can occur when the body retains sodium, loses potassium altering biochemical and hormonal activities. Some of these activities include lower aldosterone level, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis. Some other symptoms of toxicity include electrolyte imbalance, edema, increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Individuals will experience certain symptoms based on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, kidney failure, and paralysis. At least one death has been attributed to excessive licorice consumption. Many adverse effects of liquorice poisoning can be seen and most are attributed to the mineralocorticoid effects of GZA. Depending on the dose and intake of liquorice, serious problems and even hospitalization can occur. People with previously existing heart or kidney problems may be more susceptible to GZA and liquorice poisoning. It is important to monitor the amount of liquorice consumed in order to prevent toxicity. It is difficult to determine a safe level, due to many varying factors from person to person. In the most sensitive individuals, daily intake of about 100 mg GZA can cause problems. This is equivalent to 50 g liquorice sweets. However, most people can consume up to 400 mg before experiencing symptoms, which would be about 200 g liquorice sweets. A rule of thumb is that a normal healthy person can consume 10 mg GZA a day. In 2020, physicians reported a case of a man who died of cardiac arrest as a result of drastically low potassium levels. He had been eating a bag of black licorice a day for three weeks previously.

Rutherford began a career in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895.An Encyclopedia of Religion, by Vergilius Ferm, 1945, p. 674; New York Times, January 7, 1917, Section I, p. 9. He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931.P.S.L. Johnson, The Present Truth and Herald of Christ's Epiphany, April 1927, p. 66: \\"Since the Fall of 1923 ... from 20,000 to 30,000 Truth people the world over have left the Society.\\" Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.\\"Postwar Enlargement of the Theocratic Organization\\", The Watchtower, July 15, 1950, p. 217 Rutherford introduced many organizational and doctrinal changes that helped shape the current beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses. He imposed a centralized administrative structure on the worldwide Bible Student movement, which he later called a theocracy, requiring all adherents to distribute literature via door to door preaching and to provide regular reports of their preaching activity.\\"Testing and Sifting in Modern Times\\", The Watchtower, June 15, 1987, p. 17 He also instituted training programs for public speaking as part of their weekly meetings for worship.

He condemned the observance of traditional celebrations such as Christmas and birthdays, the saluting of national flags and the singing of national anthems. He introduced the name \\"Jehovah's witnesses\\" in 1931 and the term \\"Kingdom Hall\\" for houses of worship in 1935. He wrote twenty-one books and was credited by the Society in 1942 with the distribution of almost 400 million books and booklets.Consolation, May 27, 1942, p. 6. It is not clear from this publication whether this included the distribution of Russell's earlier writings. Despite significant decreases during the 1920s, overall membership increased more than sixfold by the end of Rutherford's 25 years as president.\\"Part 1‚ÄîUnited States of America\\", 1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, p. 94, \\"...earthwide report shows that the Memorial of Jesus Christ's death on April 5, 1917, was attended by 21,274.Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, pp. 312‚Äì313: Memorial attendance figures in Rutherford's final years were 98,076 (1941) and 140,450 (1942) Early life Rutherford was born on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as Boonville, Missouri, but according to his death certificate he was born in Versailles, Missouri..Dept. of Public Health, San Diego California, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, Certificate of Death issued February 6, 1942 Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16.. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer. =Law career= Rutherford spent two years as a judge's intern, became an official court reporter at age 20, and was admitted to the Missouri bar in May 1892 at age 22. He became a trial lawyer for a law firm\\"Modern History of Jehovah's Witnesses\\", Watchtower, March 15, 1955, p. 175. and later served for four years in Boonville as a public prosecutor. He campaigned briefly for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan.Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Visions of Glory ‚Äì A History and Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses, Simon & Schuster, 1978, chapter 6.

As a result of this appointment he became known by the sobriquet Judge Rutherford. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1909 and admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States the same year. Watch Tower Society Joseph F. Rutherford (1911) In 1894 Rutherford purchased the first three volumes of Charles Taze Russell's Millennial Dawn series of Bible study textbooks from two colporteurs who visited his office. Rutherford, who then viewed all religions as insincere, shallow and hypocritical, was struck by Russell's sincerity and his sentiments towards religion, which mirrored his own view. Wills (p. 131) claims Rutherford had never doubted God's existence, but Wills does not cite a source for that claim.The Watchtower (October 1, 1997, p. 6) cites a 1913 newspaper interview wherein Rutherford describes becoming an atheist after a Baptist minister claimed Rutherford's wife Mary would go to Hell because she had not been baptized. Rutherford immediately wrote to the Watch Tower Society to express appreciation for the books. He was baptized twelve years later and he and his wife began holding Bible classes in their home. In 1907, he became legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society at its Pittsburgh headquarters, and from around that time began to give public talks as a \\"pilgrim\\" representative of the Society. As Russell's health deteriorated, Rutherford represented him on trips to Europe\\"British Branch report\\", Watch Tower, January 15, 1915, p. 26, Reprints 5616. and in April 1915 he was deputized to speak at a major debate with Baptist preacher J. H. Troy over four nights in Los Angeles before an audience of 12,000, debating various subjects, including the state of the dead, hellfire and Christ's Second Coming.Yearbook, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1991, p. 73. Rutherford wrote a pamphlet, A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens, in defense of Russell\\"Judge Rutherford's Spicy Defense\\", Watch Tower, May 1, 1915, p. 130. R5685. and served as chairman of the Bible Students' Los Angeles convention in September 1916. =Board of directors= By 1916 Rutherford had become one of the seven directors of the Watch Tower Society; when Russell died on October 31, 1916 he joined vice-President Alfred I. Ritchie and Secretary-Treasurer William E. Van Amburgh on a three-man executive committee that ran the Pennsylvania corporation until a new president was elected at the annual general meeting the following January. He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run The Watch Tower from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's will, drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death;Russell's Last Will and Testament, The Watch Tower, December 15, 1916. Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose. Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, who served as an aide to the executive committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: \\"A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held a large number of votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office.\\" Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, \\"Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself had nothing to do with it.\\" =Presidency dispute= On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, was elected president of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide. By June, four of the seven Watch Tower Society directors‚ÄîRobert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright‚Äî had decided they had erred in endorsing Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president. Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The Watch Tower Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford;Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose (1959) p. 71, col. 2 however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's.Light After Darkness (September 1, 1917) p. 11Facts for Shareholders (November 15, 1917) p. 14 On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office. The controversy fractured the Bible Student movement and some congregations split into opposing groups loyal either to Rutherford or those he had expelled.Proclaimers of God's Kingdom (1993) identifies opposing sides as \\"those loyal to the Society and those who were easy prey to the smooth talk of the opposers\\" (p. 68). Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses (1975) dismisses the four ousted directors as \\"rebellious individuals who claimed to be board members\\" (p. 87) and men who \\"ambitiously sought to gain administrative control of the Society\\" (p. 92). By mid-1919 about one in seven Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford's leadership, and over the following decade they helped form or joined other groups including the Stand Fast Movement, the Layman's Home Missionary Movement, the Dawn Bible Students Association, the Pastoral Bible Institute, the Elijah Voice Movement, the Concordant Publishing Concern, and the Eagle Society. The Finished Mystery In late 1916 Fisher and another prominent Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J. Woodworth, sought the Executive Committee's approval to produce a book about the prophecies of the books of Revelation and Ezekiel based primarily on Russell's writings. Work on the book, The Finished Mystery, proceeded without the knowledge of the full Board of Directors and Editorial Committee and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors. \\"The Finished Mystery\\"‚Äîvol. 7 of \\"Studies in the Scriptures\\" The book, which was misleadingly labeled as the posthumous seventh volume of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures,Lawson, John D., American State Trials, vol 13, Thomas Law Book Company, 1921, p. viii: \\"After his death and after we were in the war they issued a seventh volume of this series, entitled \\"The Finished Mystery,\\" which, under the guise of being a posthumous work of Pastor Russell, included an attack on the war and an attack on patriotism, which were not written by Pastor Russell and could not have possibly been written by him.\\"Crompton, Robert. Counting the Days to Armageddon. Cambridge: James Clarke & Co. 1996. pp 84‚Äì85: \\"One of Rutherford's first actions as president ... was, without reference either to his fellow directors or to the editorial committee which Russell had nominated in his will, to commission a seventh volume of Studies in the Scriptures. Responsibility for preparing this volume was given to two of Russell's close associates, George H. Fisher and Clayton J. Woodworth. On the face of it, their brief was to edit for publication the notes left by Russell ... and to draw upon his published writings ... It is obvious ... that it was not in any straightforward sense the result of editing Russell's papers, rather it was in large measure the original work of Woodworth and Fisher at the behest of the new president.\\" was denounced by Rutherford's opponents, but became a best-seller and was translated into six languages and serialized in The Watch Tower. Expecting God's Kingdom to establish rule on earth and for the saints to be raised to heaven in 1918, Rutherford wrote in January of that year: \\"The Christian looks for the year to bring the full consummation of the church's hopes.\\"Watch Tower, October 1, 1917, January 1, 1918. He embarked on a vast advertising campaign to expose the \\"unrighteousness\\" of religions and their alliances with \\"beastly\\" governments, expanding on claims in The Finished Mystery that patriotism was a delusion and murder. The campaign attracted the attention of governments and on February 12, 1918 the book was banned by the Canadian government for what a Winnipeg newspaper described as \\"seditious and antiwar statements\\". On February 24 in Los Angeles Rutherford gave a talk entitled \\"The World Has Ended‚ÄîMillions Now Living May Never Die\\" (subsequent talks in the series were renamed, \\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die\\")The initial delivery was entitled \\"The World Has Ended‚ÄîMillions Now Living May Never Die\\". See: \\"Noteworthy Events in the Modern-day History of Jehovah's Witnesses\\", Jehovah's Witnesses ‚Äì Proclaimers of God's Kingdom\\", 1993 Watch Tower, p. 719, \\"1918 The discourse \\"The World Has Ended‚ÄîMillions Now Living May Never Die\\" is first delivered, on February 24, in Los Angeles, California. On March 31, in Boston, Massachusetts, the talk is entitled \\"The World Has Ended‚ÄîMillions Now Living Will Never Die\\" [emphasis added]Los Angeles Morning Tribune, February 25, 1918, as recorded in Faith on the March by A. H. Macmillan, 1957, p. 86 in which he attacked the clergy, declaring: \\"As a class, according to the Scriptures, the clergymen are the most reprehensible men on earth for the great war that is now afflicting mankind.\\" Three days later the Army Intelligence Bureau seized the Society's Los Angeles offices and confiscated literature. =Imprisonment and release= In early May 1918 US Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory condemned The Finished Mystery as \\"one of the most dangerous examples of ... propaganda ... a work written in extremely religious language and distributed in enormous numbers\\". Warrants were issued for the arrest of Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower directors, who were charged under the 1917 Espionage Act of attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty, refusal of duty in the armed forces and obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service of the U.S. while it was at war. On June 21 seven of them, including Rutherford, were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Rutherford feared his opponents would gain control of the Society in his absence, but on January 2, 1919 he learned he had been re-elected president at the Pittsburgh convention the day before, convincing him that God wanted him in the position. On 26 March 1919 the directors were released on bail after an appeals court ruled they had been wrongly convicted; in May 1920 the government announced that all charges had been dropped. Reorganization =Administrative changes= Following his release from prison, Rutherford began a major reorganization of Bible Student activities. At a May, 1919 convention in Ohio he announced the publication of a new magazine, The Golden Age (later renamed Awake!). Because Russell's will had decreed the Society should publish no other periodicals the new magazine was at first published by \\"Woodworth, Hudgings & Martin\\", with a Manhattan (rather than Brooklyn) address.The Golden Age, volume 1, number 1, October 1, 1919, cover, As Retrieved 2010-02-16 Within months Bible Students were organized to distribute it door-to-door. He expanded the Society's printing facilities, revived the colporteur work and in 1920 introduced the requirement for weekly reports of Bible Students' preaching activity.\\"Annual report for 1920\\", The Watchtower, December 15, 1920, \\"At the beginning of the fiscal year there were only 225 active colporteurs in the field. The number has now increased to 350, all of whom are devoting their entire time to the service ... In addition to the colporteurs there are reported to this office 8,052 class workers.\\" He expanded and reorganized overseas branch offices in what he regarded as a \\"cleansing\\" and \\"sifting\\" work. J.F. RutherfordBeginning with an eight-day convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922 Rutherford, launched a series of major international conventions under the theme \\"Advertise the King and Kingdom\\", attracting crowds of up to 20,000. Audiences were urged to \\"herald the message far and wide\\". He stressed that the primary duty of all Bible Students was to become \\"publicity agents\\" in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14, especially in the form of door-to-door evangelism with the Society's publications.Watchtower March 1, 1925 p. 72 col 2 In 1928 Rutherford began to teach that the Cedar Point convention and the events resulting from it fulfilled the prophecy of the 1290 days at Daniel 12:11.Watchtower December 15, 1929 pp 371‚Äì77: \\"Briefly, then, these prophecies and the dates of their fulfilment are as follows, to wit: The fixed \\"time of the end\\" is October 1, 1914 A.D. The 1260-day period ended in April, 1918. The 1290-day period ended September, 1922. The 1335-day period of blessedness began May, 1926, and goes on for ever.\\"The Harp of God, 1928 edition In 1920, Rutherford published a booklet, Millions Now Living Will Never Die, and a year later published his first hardcover book, The Harp of God. This was followed by a further nineteen hardcover books, each with one-word titles, such as Creation (1927), Jehovah (1934) and Children (1941). His publications reached a total printing of 36 million copies. In 1925 he gained full control over what doctrines would be taught in Watch Tower Society publications, overruling the refusal by the five-man Editorial Committee to publish his article, \\"Birth of the Nation\\",Watchtower, March 1, 1925 pp 67‚Äì74. In the content list on the cover the article is entitled Birth of a Nation, but the article itself on page 67 is entitled Birth of the Nation which contained significant doctrinal changes. Rutherford later claimed Satan had \\"tried to prevent the publication of that article ... but failed in that effort\\";Watchtower, July 1, 1938, p. 201. In 1927 the Watch Tower Society ceased printing of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures.WTB&TS;, \\"God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached\\" (1973) p. 347 The Editorial Committee was dissolved in 1931, after which Rutherford wrote every leading article in The Watch Tower until his death. The 1933 Watch Tower Society Yearbook observed that the demise of the Editorial Committee indicated \\"that the Lord himself is running his organization\\".Yearbook, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1933, p. 11. Rutherford expanded his means of spreading the Watch Tower message in 1924 with the start of 15-minute radio broadcasts, initially from WBBR, based on Staten Island, and eventually via a network of as many as 480 radio stations. A 1931 talk was broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the NBC and BBC radio networks banning his broadcasts. In 1928 Rutherford began to abolish the system of electing elders by congregational voting, dismissing them as \\"haughty\\" and \\"lazy\\", and finally asserting in 1932 that electing elders was unscriptural. He impressed on elders the need to obey the Society's \\"regulations\\", \\"instructions\\" and \\"directions\\" without complaint. Service directors, who reported back to Brooklyn, were appointed in each congregation and a weekly \\"service meeting\\" introduced to meeting programs. In 1933 Rutherford claimed that abolishing elective elders was a fulfillment of the prophecy of 2300 days at Daniel 8:13‚Äì14, and that God's sanctuary (the Watch Tower Society) was thereby cleansed.Watchtower July 15, 1933 pp. 214-15: \\"Beginning to count from the transgression resulting by reason of the League of Nations, and the giving of notice, which must begin May 25, 1926, the twenty-three hundred days, or six years, four months, and twenty days, would end October 15, 1932...What, then, took place at the end of the twenty-three- hundred-day period? The Watchtower, issues of August 15 and September 1, 1932, brought before God's people the Scriptural proof that the office of \\"elective elder\\", chosen or selected by vote of creatures, does not Scripturally exist, and that therefore the selection of elders by such means should end.\\" In 1971 the Watchtower Society changed the interpretation ending the 2300 days in 1944 rather than 1932. At a 1931 Bible Student assembly in Columbus, Ohio Rutherford proposed a new name for the organization, Jehovah's witnesses, to differentiate them from the proliferation of other groups that followed Russell's teachings. Bible Students who opposed or abandoned Rutherford to form new groups were increasingly described as the \\"evil servant class\\" by The Watchtower, which said it was wrong to pray for those who were \\"unfaithful\\".Watchtower, February 15, 1933. Four years later the term \\"Kingdom Hall\\" was introduced for the local meeting place of congregations.Jehovah's Witnesses ‚Äì Proclaimers of God's Kingdom chap. 20 p. 319, 721 In 1937, the door-to-door preaching program was extended to formally include \\"back calls\\" on interested people and Witnesses were urged to start one-hour Bible studies in the homes of householders.\\"Testing and Sifting in Modern Times\\", The Watchtower, June 15, 1987, p. 18. In the late 1930s, he advocated the use of \\"sound cars\\" and portable phonographs with which talks by Rutherford were played to passersby and householders. In 1938 he introduced the term \\"theocracy\\" to describe the denomination's system of government, with Consolation explaining: \\"The Theocracy is at present administered by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, of which Judge Rutherford is the president and general manager.\\"Consolation, September 4, 1940, p. 25, as cited by Penton, p. 61. \\"Zone servants\\" (now known as circuit overseers) were appointed to supervise congregations. In a Watchtower article Rutherford declared the need for congregations to \\"get in line\\" with the changed structure.Watchtower, June 15, 1938. By 1942, the year of his death, worldwide attendance at the annual Memorial of Christ's death was 140,450 though his restructuring of the Bible Student community coincided with a dramatic loss of followers during the 1920s and 1930s. Worldwide attendance of the annual Memorial of Christ's death fell from 90,434 in 1925 to 17,380 in 1928. Memorial attendance figures did not surpass 90,000 again until 1940. Author Tony Wills, who analyzed attendance and \\"field worker\\" statistics, suggests it was the \\"more dedicated\\" Bible Students who quit through the 1920s, to be replaced by newcomers in larger numbers, although Rutherford dismissed the loss of the original Bible Students as the Lord \\"shaking out\\" the unfaithful.1931 Yearbook, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, p. 57. In the 1942 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, Rutherford wrote that the year's achievements \\"would, on the face of it, show that the Theocratic witness work on earth is about done\\".Yearbook, 1942, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, p. 29. =Doctrinal changes= In July 1917, Rutherford had The Finished Mystery published as a seventh volume of the Studies in the Scriptures series. The volume, though written by Fisher and Woodworth, was advertised as Russell's \\"posthumous work\\" and \\"last legacy\\"The Finished Mystery, 1917, p. 2: \\"POSTHUMOUS WORK OF PASTOR RUSSELL His Last Legacy to the Dear Israel of God (Matt. 20:9)\\"The Bible Students Monthly, December 1917, vol. 9 no. 9, p. 1: \\"The following article is extracted mainly from Pastor Russell's posthumous volume entitled \\"THE FINISHED MYSTERY,\\" the 7th in the series of his STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES and published subsequent to his death... In this posthumous volume, which is called his \\"last legacy to the Christians of earth\\" is found a thorough exposition of every verse in the entire Book of Revelation.\\" but contained several interpretations and viewpoints not espoused by Russell,Tony Mills, A People for His Name, 2007, pp 97‚Äì8: \\"While he keeps faithfully to Russell's comments in most cases, there are a few times when he goes beyond Russell's plainly stated interpretation. In some of the chapters of Revelation on which Russell left no comments his imagination wandered free. He ridicules John Wesley, whom Russell admired, and his Methodist movement. He calls Europeans \\"the most cruel, bloodthirsty, quarrelsome, rapacious people on earth,\\" a thought Russell denied. He ridicules Calvinists by saying that they have \\"lost their manhood, reason and common sense.\\" He ridicules politics, patriotism, religion and almost everything the world holds holy, without (as Russell was careful to do) presenting the good along with the bad.\\"Bible Students Tract Society, Notes and Comments on the Finished Mystery, Feb. 1919, pp 6‚Äì7: \\"Thus we have Bro. Woodworth's distinct statement that none of these interpretations of Revelation are Pastor Russell's, but another's (presumably his own)... Have Pastor Russell's interpretations been followed? To this we reply that in many cases they have not. On the contrary, entirely contradictory ones are frequently given.\\" including an urging of all Bible Students to cast judgment upon Christendom and its clergy, the adoption of new dates for the fulfillment of particular prophecies, a claim that salvation is tied to membership within the Watch Tower Society, as well as shunning and censuring any who reject the interpretations given in the volume or related articles in Zion's Watch Tower magazine. \\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die\\" contains some of the earliest doctrinal changesNewspaper advertisement for Rutherford's \\"Millions\\" lecture.In the February 1918 discourse \\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die\\" (printed in booklet form in May 1920) a revision of Russell's calculation of a \\"Jubilee type\\" was presented, changing it from 1875 to 1925,The Time is at Hand, 1889, p. 183: \\"Reckoned from the beginning of the seventy years desolation under Babylon, the great cycle [50x50] ends with the year A.D. 1875.\\"Millions Now Living Will Never Die!, 1920, p.88 : \\"A simple calculation of these jubilees brings us to this important fact: Seventy jubilees of fifty years each would be a total of 3500 years. That period of time beginning 1575 before A.D. 1 of necessity would end in the fall of the year 1925.\\" despite Russell's rejection of such a change a few months prior to his death.The Watch Tower April 15, 1916 p. 127: \\"We cannot help it that many of the dear friends continue to tell what THE WATCH TOWER believes, and to misrepresent its teachings. Our kindest thought must be that they are not giving much heed to its teachings. Otherwise they would know from its columns that we are not looking forward to 1925, nor to any other date. As expressly stated in THE WATCH TOWER, we are simply going on, our last date or appointment having been passed more than a year ago...we have no different time in mind from the Scriptures on the subject and do not expect to have any.\\" In October 1920 the Society published a new edition of Russell's 1881 Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices. It included an appendix introducing many alterations or reinterpretations of Russell's original views on the death of Jesus and the role of Christ's followers in heaven as typified in the ceremonies of the Jewish tabernacle.Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices, 1920, Appendix of Notes pp 133‚Äì155: \\"Thirty-nine years have passed since the publication of this little booklet; and during that time some of the teachings herein contained have come to be seen in clearer light ‚Äì even as the details of a mountain become more discernible the closer one draws to it. In harmony with these clearer understandings we suggest the following alterations in appendix form, leaving the text intact out of deference to the honored and beloved writer of the booklet.\\" At the 1922 Cedar Point convention Rutherford began teaching that Christ's reign had begun in 1914,Watchtower, December 15, 1922, p. 394. and not 1878 as Russell had taught.\\"How Long, O Lord?\\", Zion's Watch Tower, January 1881. Rutherford expanded on this view in the March 1, 1925 issue of The Watch Tower in the article \\"Birth of The Nation\\", which he later acknowledged \\"caused a real stir or shake-up within the ranks.\\" In 1927 he moved the date of the resurrection of the \\"sleeping saints\\" (all Christians who had died since Jesus' time) from 1878 to 1918Watchtower June 1, 1927 p. 166.Light by J. F. Rutherford, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1930, p 226. and as early as 1930 began to dismiss the year 1874 as the date for the invisible presence of Christ in favor of the year 1914.The Golden Age May 7, 1930 p. 503The Golden Age March 14, 1934 p 380 \\"Prior to 1914 and years thereafter we thought that our Lord's return dated from 1874; and we took it for granted that the parousia or presence of our Lord dated from that time. An examination of the scriptures containing the word parousia shows that the presence of the Lord could not date prior to 1914.\\" From 1925 he developed the view of the battle of Armageddon as a universal war waged by God rather than Russell's belief that it was the decline of human society into social, political and religious anarchy. Rutherford based his interpretations on the books of Exodus, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Psalms as well as additional material from the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles.\\"Can This World's Armageddon Be Avoided?\\", Watchtower, December 1, 1966, p. 730. An article in the January 1, 1926 Watch Tower introduced new emphasis on the importance of the name \\"Jehovah\\"; from 1929 Rutherford taught that the vindication of God's name‚Äîwhich would ultimately occur when millions of unbelievers were destroyed at Armageddon‚Äîwas the primary doctrine of Christianity and more important than God's display of goodness or grace toward humankind.J.F. Rutherford, Prophecy, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1929, pp. 319, 328‚Äì333J.F. Rutherford, Vindication, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1931, pp. 9‚Äì14, 65‚Äì68, 135. In 1932 he published an interpretation of a passage in Ezekiel describing the attack on Jerusalem by Gog of Magog, in which he predicted an intensification of persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses that would culminate in God intervening on their behalf to begin the battle of Armageddon, which would destroy all opposers of God's organization. In 1926 he discredited Russell's teaching on the importance of Christian \\"character development\\" or personal \\"sanctification\\"\\"Character or Covenant ‚Äì Which?\\", The Watchtower, May 1, 1926 and a year later discarded the teaching that Russell had been the \\"faithful and wise servant\\" of Matthew 24:45‚Äì47, warning that the desire to revere men was a snare set by the Devil.Watchtower, January 1, 1927, p. 7. In May 1926 Rutherford released his book Deliverance at the Bible Student's convention in Kensington, England later interpreting the event as the fulfillment of the 1335 days of Daniel 12:12.Watchtower July 15, 1933 p. 214 col 2 In 1927, Christmas was declared to be of pagan origin, and the following year its celebration by Bible Students was condemned as supporting \\"Satan's organization\\".The Golden Age, December 14, 1927, \\"The Origin of Christmas\\", pp 178‚Äì791975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, 1974, p. 147 Mother's Day was condemned in 1931,Vindication book 1, 1931, pp 158‚Äì60: \\"On the face of it the arrangement of \\"Mother's Day\\" seems harmless and calculated to do good. But the people are in ignorance of Satan's subtle hand in the matter, and that he is back of the movement, to turn the people away from God... Neither the man nor the woman should be worshiped for doing right, because such doing of right is their duty. Creature worship of any kind is wrong and an abomination in the sight of God.\\" with other holidays as well as birthdays officially renounced in subsequent years.George Chryssides, Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses, 2008, p. 21Jehovah's Witnesses: Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, 1993, p. 199 In 1928 Rutherford discarded Russell's teaching that the natural Jews would be restored to Palestine and return to God's favor, despite having declared ten years earlier that prophecies of their restoration were already being fulfilled with the British takeover of Palestine from Turkey during World War I. He denied there was a role for Jews in God's Kingdom arrangement and by 1933 he had reversed Russell's earlier teaching, claiming that prominent Jewish business leaders were \\"arrogant, self-important and extremely selfish,\\" and would gain no favored standing with God.J. F. Rutherford, Favored People, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, as cited by Wills, 2007, p. 129. The teaching that God would restore the Jews to Palestine was discontinued around the same time. Russell's teaching that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built under God's direction was overturned in 1928, when Rutherford asserted that it had been built under the direction of Satan for the purpose of deceiving God's people in the last days.The Messenger, August 5, 1928 p. 1: \\"When the Lord spoke of hiding his people in his secret place he was not talking about any chambers in the pyramid, built by the Devil himself.\\"The Watch Tower, November 15, 1928 The announcement prompted further defections among long-time Bible Students.Great Pyramid Passages, 1924, reprint by Portland Area Bible Students, 1988, pp i‚ÄìxxxviiiThe Messenger, August 5, 1928 p. 2: \\"It sure did set the tongues wagging at the Fair Grounds and resulted in another overhauling of the old trunk wherein are kept a few choice relics of what, until recently, we honestly believed the Bible teaches.\\" In 1930, Rutherford published a systematic reinterpretation of the book of Revelation.Light book 1 and 2, 1930 Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928.Light book 1, 1930, p. 106 These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as the historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.The Finished Mystery, 1917Gruss, p. 172The Watch Tower, Nov 15, 1916, p. 343 At a Washington, D.C. convention in 1935, Rutherford rejected Russell's teaching that the \\"great company\\" of Revelation 7:9 was a \\"secondary spiritual class\\" composed of millions of Christians who would be resurrected to heaven apart from the 144,000 \\"elect\\", and instead argued that the \\"great multitude\\", the \\"sheep\\" of Matthew 25 and the \\"Jonadabs\\" of 2 Kings chapter 10 all picture the people who could potentially survive Armageddon and receive everlasting human life on earth if they became Jehovah's Witnesses before it began. In 1935, Rutherford objected to U.S. state laws requiring school students to salute the flag as a means of instilling patriotism; in the 1936 Yearbook he declared that baptized Jehovah's Witnesses who did salute the flag were breaking their covenant with God and were thus \\"guilty of death\\".Yearbook, 1936, p. 22, \\"The saluting of or salutation to a flag means this: 'I depend on what the flag represents for my salvation. Those who know and serve God in spirit and in truth look to Jehovah God for salvation, and not to any man or any man-made organization. It therefore follows that the saluting of any flag by those who are in covenant with Jehovah God to do his will constitutes the breaking of that covenant with God, and such covenant breakers are guilty of death.\\" In 1940, children in 43 states were expelled for refusing to salute the flag and the Watch Tower Society took most cases to court, with Rutherford personally leading the unsuccessful case of Minersville School District v. Gobitis. Controversy over the flag salute issue escalated and mob attacks became prevalent in many U.S. states until 1943 when the court overruled its previous decision in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. A U.S. law magazine noted how Jehovah's Witnesses had helped shape the course of constitutional law, remarking: \\"Through almost constant litigation this organization had made possible an ever-increasing list of precedents concerning the application of the 14th amendment to freedom of speech and religion\\".American Bar Association's Bill of Rights Review, Vol 2, No.4, Summer 1942, p. 262. In 1936, Rutherford rejected the belief that Jesus had been executed on a Roman cross, in favor of an upright stake or \\"tree.\\"Riches, 1936, p. 27: \\"Jesus was crucified, not on a cross of wood, such as is exhibited in many images and pictures, and which images are made and exhibited by men; Jesus was crucified by nailing his body to a tree.\\" Character and attitudes Rutherford with Cadillac V-16 from the Watchtower publication The Messenger (1931)Biographers describe Rutherford as tall and solidly built with a senatorial demeanor,Herbert H. Stroup, The Jehovah's Witnesses, Columbia University Press, 1945, p. 16. and a strong booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford \\"has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker\\". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford \\"was warm and generous toward his associates but he was also a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense.\\" Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, \\"His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood.\\" Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford \\"spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that what he had to say was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death.\\" Macmillan added, \\"He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth.\\" Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper,P.S.L. Johnson's Harvest Siftings Reviewed (1917, p.17) relates an incident in which an enraged Rutherford rushed at him in a confrontation in Brooklyn Bethel, grabbed at his arm and \\"almost jerked me off my feet\\". Johnson complains that in an earlier hearing of complaints against him, Rutherford treated him to \\"sneers, sarcasm and ridicule. His face expressed more contempt than that of any other face upon which I have ever looked.\\"(p.14) with \\"a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil\\", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a \\"dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance.\\" Rutherford's confrontation with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness of his personality and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played \\"hard-fisted church politics\\" and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using The Watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At the heart of his opponents' complaints was his \\"autocratic\\" behavior as he strove to \\"exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs.\\" Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency‚Äîincluding his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish The Finished Mystery‚Äîas high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, \\"It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord.\\" Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and \\"did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter\\". A 1940 Rutherford booklet \\"exposing\\" a Catholic campaign of mob violence against Jehovah's WitnessesAccording to Wills, Rutherford emerged from prison in 1919 bitter against the world and the collusion he saw between the clergy and military that had secured his imprisonment. Soon after his release he coined the term \\"Satan's organization\\" to refer to this supposed conspiracy. In Watchtower articles Rutherford was similarly scathing towards big business, politics and the League of Nations. Rogerson describes Rutherford's attitude towards the clergy‚Äîhis avowed enemies‚Äîas \\"unadulterated hatred\\". His attacks on clergymen, particularly those of the Catholic Church, from the late 1920s were strong enough to attract a ban on his broadcasts by the NBC radio network, which condemned his \\"rabid attack upon organized religion and the clergy\\".Yearbook, 1930, p. 38 He also applied criticizing terms to those who had deserted Watch Tower ranks, calling them the \\"evil servant\\".The term was drawn from the account of the \\"faithful servant\\" and \\"evil servant\\" of Matthew 24:45‚Äì51. He urged readers to view with contempt anyone who had \\"openly rebelled against God's order or commandments\\"Watchtower, February 15, 1933, p. 55. and also described elective elders of the 1930s who refused to submit to Watch Tower Society administrative changes as \\"despicable\\".Watchtower, March 15, 1938, p.87 Wills states that Rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. He claims that towards the close of his ministry Rutherford spent about half of each year's Watchtowers writing about Armageddon. According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity‚Äîevidenced by his distaste for Christmas, birthday parties and other popular customsJ.F.Rutherford, Vindication, Vol I, pp. 188, 189, as cited by Wills, p. 139. that were described as of pagan origin or that encouraged creature worship and were not to be observed‚Äîled in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings;, \\"singing in local congregations was largely dispensed with in about 1938\\"The Watchtower, May 1, 1938, p 139, \\"At all study meetings...the one presiding at the study might well, as a prelude to the meeting, briefly state God's purpose which is now being performed... two minutes might well be devoted to such at the beginning of all meetings for study [by] the one presiding... A few words like the above pronounced at the beginning of the study would be far more beneficial than to occupy the same time in singing songs, which often express much that is out of harmony with the truth\\" singing was reinstated soon after his death.\\"Music's Place in Modern Worship\\", The Watchtower, February 1, 1997, pp 26‚Äì27, \\"In 1938 singing at congregation meetings was largely dispensed with. However, the wisdom of following apostolic example and direction soon prevailed. At the 1944 district convention, F. W. Franz...announced the release of the Kingdom Service Song Book for use at the weekly service meetings.\\" Rutherford's books and magazine articles reveal his strong views on \\"the proper place of women\\" in the church and society. In a 1931 book he linked the post-1919 rise of women's movements that encouraged equality of the sexes with satanic influence,J.F.Rutherford, Vindication, Vol I, pp. 155‚Äì159, as cited by Wills, p. 139. and claimed the custom of men tipping their hats to women or standing when a woman approached was a scheme of the devil to turn men from God and indicated an effeminate streak in men who practiced the custom. Mother's Day was similarly described as part of a plan to turn people away from God.J.F.Rutherford, Vindication, Vol I, pp. 155‚Äì157, as cited by Wills, p. 139. In 1938 he urged adherents to delay marriage and child-bearing until after Armageddon,Watchtower, November 15, 1938, p. 346. which Wills claims prompted a strong community bias among Witnesses against marriage. Those who did marry, says Wills, were considered to be weak in faith. At a 1941 convention in Missouri he quoted Rudyard Kipling's description of women as \\"a rag and a bone and a hank of hair\\".Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Visions of Glory ‚Äì A History and Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses, Simon & Schuster, 1978, chapter 3. Former Jehovah's Witness and former Governing Body member Raymond Franz claimed there was no evidence Rutherford engaged in door-to-door ministry despite his assertion that it was a requirement and sacred duty of all Witnesses. Franz claimed to have heard Rutherford's associates say his responsibilities as president \\"do not permit his engaging in this activity\\".Raymond Franz, In Search of Christian Freedom, Commentary Press, 2007, pp. 191‚Äì192 Macmillan, however, related details of Rutherford's home preaching in 1905 or 1906 when he was baptized,\\"Part 1‚ÄîUnited States of America\\", 1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, 1975 Watch Tower, p 83 and a 1975 article quoted several Witnesses relating their experiences with Rutherford in the house-to-house ministry in the 1920s.\\"Part 2‚ÄîUnited States of America\\", 1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, 1975 Watch Tower, p 133 The official history of Jehovah's Witnesses also notes, \\"Rutherford personally shared with other conventioners as they engaged in the work of Kingdom proclamation from house to house.\\"\\"Conventions Proof of Our Brotherhood\\", Jehovah's Witnesses ‚Äì Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, 1993 Watch Tower, p 260 On August 2, 1928 in a meeting with the Bible Student elders who had attended a general convention in Detroit, Michigan Rutherford listed his responsibilities and concluded \\"when I have attended to many other details, I have not had very much time to go from door to door.\\"The Messenger, August 3, 1928 p. 5: \\"Frequently some elder says: \\"The president of the Society does not go from house to house selling books. Why should I?\\" ... When I have looked after the management of the work at headquarters with its many departments; when I have given attention to a voluminous mail; when I have managed thirty odd branch offices in different parts of the earth and kept in close touch with them by correspondence and examination of their reports, and given advice and counsel as to what shall be done; when I have given attention to may legal matters that have arisen against members of the Society by reason of the opposition of the enemy; when I have given counsel to the various parts of the radio work; when I have prepared copy for The Watch Tower and other publications; and occasionally written a book or booklet and followed its progress through the manufacturing thereof; and when I have attended to many other details, I have not had very much time to go from door to door.\\" Authors William Whalen and James Penton have claimed that Rutherford was to Russell what Brigham Young was to Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. Penton contends that both Russell and Smith were capable religious leaders but naive visionaries, while Rutherford and Young were \\"hard-bitten pragmatists who gave a degree of permanency to the movements they dominated\\".Prof. William J. Whalen, Armageddon Around the Corner: A report on Jehovah's Witnesses, John Day, New York, 1962, page 67 Personal life Beth Sarim was built in San Diego, California in 1929.

(1919‚Äì1941)\\", Jehovah's Witnesses ‚Äì Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, 1993 Watch Tower, p 75 In 1929, a residence named Beth Sarim (literally, House of Princes) was constructed at San Diego, California for Rutherford's use, (17MB)1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, 1974 Watch Tower, p 194, \\"In time, a direct contribution was made for the purpose of constructing a house in San Diego for Brother Rutherford's use.\\" initially as winter accommodation and later as a full-time residence.New York Times Deeds San Diego Home To Kings of Israel; Judge Rutherford in the Interim Occupies the House and Drives the Cars March 19, 1930 p. 31 He died at the property in 1942. The villa was sold in 1948, with The Watchtower declaring, \\"It had fully served its purpose and was now only serving as a monument quite expensive to keep.\\"Watchtower, December 15, 1947, as cited by Proclaimers, 1993, p. 76. The standard of Rutherford's accommodation and his personal conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of \\"luxurious\\" and \\"expensive\\" residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), as well as two CadillacsThe Watchtower, May 15. 1937, p 159Jehovah's Witnesses and the Third Reich by M. James Penton, University of Toronto Press, 2004, p 368; though Salter's letter was dated \\"April 1, 1937\\", Penton writes, \\"Salter had broken with the Watch Tower Society and had been excommunicated from the Witness community at the time he wrote the letter.\\" and alleged that on more than one occasion he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from \\"drink to drink\\"'.Letter to Rutherford by Walter Salter, reproduced in Jehovah's Witnesses and the Third Reich: sectarian politics under persecution by M. James Penton, University of Toronto Press, 2004, pp. 365-7., \\"I, at your orders would purchase cases of whiskey at $60.00 a case, and cases of brandy and other liquors, to say nothing of untold cases of beer. A bottle or two of liquor would not do... [Rutherford] sends us out from door to door to face the enemy while he goes from 'drink to drink,' and tells us if we don't we are going to be destroyed.\\" In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing \\"the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren.\\" Moyle also accused Rutherford of \\"unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language\\" and condemned his allowing the \\"glorification of alcohol\\" at Bethel.Moyle letter to Rutherford, July 21, 1939.Society directors defended Rutherford in an October 1939 Watchtower article, accusing Moyle of lies and \\"wicked slander\\" and claimed he was a \\"Judas\\" trying to cause division. Moyle successfully sued the board of directors for libel, collecting $15,000 plus court costs. See Penton, pp. 80‚Äì83 and Wills, pp. 202‚Äì205. Penton notes that Moyle was a \\"teetotaller\\" and \\"puritanical\\", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were \\"notorious\\" and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.: \\"Although Jehovah's Witnesses have done everything possible to hide accounts of the judge's drinking habits, they are simply too notorious to be denied. Former workers at the Watch Tower's New York headquarters recount tales of his inebriation and drunken stupors. Others tell stories of how difficult it sometimes was to get him to the podium to give talks at conventions because of his drunkenness. In San Diego, California, where he spent his winters from 1930 until his death, an elderly lady still speaks of how she sold him great quantities of liquor when he came to purchase medicines in her husband's drugstore.\\" Death and burial From the age of 70, Rutherford underwent several medical treatments for cancer of the colon. This included an operation on November 5, 1941, which found \\"carcinoma of the rectal sigmoid\\". Doctors gave him less than six months to live. Rutherford died at Beth Sarim on January 8, 1942 at the age of 72. Cause of death was \\"uraemia due to carcinoma of the rectum due to pelvic metastasis.\\" A Watch Tower Society staff member said of the announcement of Rutherford's death, \\"It was at noontime when the family was assembled for lunch. ... The announcement was brief. There were no speeches. No one took the day off to mourn. Rather, we went back to the factory and worked harder than ever.\\" Rutherford's burial was delayed for five months due to legal proceedings arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters. According to Consolation, \\"Judge Rutherford looked for the early triumph of 'the King of the East', Christ Jesus, now leading the host of heaven, and he desired to be buried at dawn facing the rising sun, in an isolated part of the ground which would be administered by the princes, who should return from their graves.\\"Consolation, May 27, 1942. Based on his claims that resurrected biblical characters would live at Beth Sarim, Rutherford concluded that it was appropriate that his bones be buried on the property. The legal problem arose because Beth Sarim was not a legally zoned cemetery. Witnesses collected more than 14,000 signatures for two petitions‚Äîone supporting his burial at Beth Sarim, another for a second preferred site on a nearby Watch Tower Society property named Beth-Shan‚Äîthat Rutherford's dying wish might be granted.\\"San Diego officials line up against New Earth's princes\\", Consolation, May 27, 1942, pp. 6,9 Consolation condemned San Diego County officials for their refusal to grant a permit for Rutherford's burial at either property, stating \\"It was not the fate of the bones which they decided, but their own destiny. Nor is their blood on anyone else's head, because they were told three times that to fight against God, or to tamper with His servant's bones even, would bring upon them the condemnation of the Lord. ... So their responsibility is fixed, and they followed the course of Satan.\\" Speculation that Rutherford was secretly buried at Beth Sarim has been called \\"private rumor\\", 'frequently disproven', and \\"myth\\". The May 4, 1942 issue of Time magazine noted Rutherford's burial at Rossville, New York, on Staten Island; a private burial plot for Watch Tower branch volunteers is on Woodrow Road.\\"Announcements\\", The Watchtower, October 1, 1966, p 608 In 2002, a caretaker at the immediately adjoining graveyard answered an inquiry about Watch Tower's graveyard by noting, \\"I couldn't tell you who is buried on it because it has absolutely no markers or headstones\\". Rutherford was succeeded by Nathan Homer Knorr as president of the Watch Tower Society.

However, when King Chungsuk fathered Buddhashri (King Chunghye), √ñljeyit√º forced to abdicate from crown prince, but King Chungseon transferred his post of King of Shen to him instead. The title of King of Shen was originally given to King Chungseon by Khayishan (K√ºl√ºg Khan) after his support of Khayisan's succession in 1307. √ñljeyit√º married with a daughter of Sungshan (ÊùæÂ±± songshan), King of Liang (Á≤±Áéã) of the imperial family. When Sidibala (Gegeen Khan) ascended to the throne in 1320, √ñljeyit√º began a campaign to become the King of Goryeo. By his scheme, the Khan banished Chungseon to Tibet in 1320 and interned King Chungsuk in 1321. However, Sidibala was assassinated in 1323 and √ñljeit√º's plan was aborted. King Chungsuk, who was allowed to return to Goryeo in 1325, passed the throne to Buddhashri in 1330 but was reinstated after two years because Buddhashri was deposed by Yuan.

She is known for having walked out of American- occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack. Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime, but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada. Though Laura Secord had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her with the Laura Secord Chocolates company, named after her on the centennial of her walk. Laura Secord's father, Thomas Ingersoll, lived in Massachusetts and fought on the side of the Patriots during the Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783). In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of Upper Canada after he had applied for and received a land grant. Shortly after, Laura married Loyalist James Secord, who was later seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights early in the War of 1812. While he was still recovering in 1813, the Americans invaded the Niagara Peninsula, including Queenston. During the occupation, Secord acquired information about a planned American attack, and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant James FitzGibbon in the territory still controlled by the British. The information helped the British and their Mohawk allies repel the invading Americans at the Battle of Beaver Dams. Her effort was forgotten until 1860, when Edward, Prince of Wales awarded the impoverished widow ¬£100 for her service on his visit to Canada. The story of Laura Secord has taken on mythic overtones in Canada. Her tale has been the subject of books, plays, and poetry, often with many embellishments. Since her death, Canada has bestowed honours on her, including schools named after her, monuments, a museum, a memorial stamp and coin, and a statue at the Valiants Memorial in the Canadian capital. Personal history =Family history and early life= Thomas Ingersoll (1749‚Äì1812) married seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Dewey on 28 February 1775. Their first child, Laura, was born in Great Barrington in the colonial Province of Massachusetts Bay on 13 September 1775. Thomas's family had lived in Massachusetts for five generations. His paternal immigrant ancestor was Richard Ingersoll, who had arrived in Salem, Massachusetts, from Bedfordshire, England, in 1629. Thomas was born in 1749 in Westfield, Massachusetts. Elizabeth, daughter of Israel Dewey and his wife, was also born in Westfield, on 28 January 1758. Thomas moved to Great Barrington in 1774, where he settled into a house on a small piece of land by the Housatonic River. Over the next several years, his success as a hatmaker allowed him to marry, increase his landholdings, and expand his house as his family grew. He spent much time away from home, as he rose through the ranks in the military on the side of the American revolutionaries during the American Revolutionary War. Upon his return to Great Barrington, he was made a magistrate. Elizabeth gave birth to three more girls: Elizabeth Franks on 17 October 1779; Mira (or Myra) in 1781; and Abigail in September 1783. They gave up Abigail for adoption in 1784 to an aunt with the surname Nash. Elizabeth Ingersoll died 20 February 1784. Thomas remarried the following year to Mercy Smith, widow of Josiah Smith, on 26 May 1785. Mercy had no children. She has been credited with teaching her stepdaughters to read and do needlework before her death from tuberculosis in 1789. By adolescence, the eldest daughter Laura was caring for her sisters and looking after the household affairs. Thomas remarried four months after Mercy's death, on 20 September 1789, to Sarah \\"Sally\\" Backus, a widow with a daughter, Harriet. The couple had an additional four girls and three boys. The first boy, Charles Fortescue, was born on 27 September 1791. Charlotte (born 1793) and Appolonia (born 1794) were the last members of this branch of the Ingersoll family to be born in Massachusetts. Thomas helped suppress Shays' Rebellion in 1786, which earned him the rank of major. In the years following, he witnessed and was offended by the continuing persecution of Loyalists in Massachusetts. He realized that in the depressed economic conditions that followed the Revolutionary War, and with his own deep debts, he was unlikely to see his former prosperity again. In 1793, Thomas met in New York City with Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, who offered to show him the best land for settlement in Upper Canada, where the Crown was encouraging development. He and four associates travelled to Upper Canada to petition Lieutenant Governor John Simcoe for a land grant. They received in the Thames Valley, and founded Oxford-on-the-Thames (later known as Ingersoll, Ontario), on condition that they populate it with forty other families within seven years. After winding up their affairs in Great Barrington, the Ingersoll family moved to Upper Canada in 1795. =Upper Canada, marriage and children= Thomas Ingersoll supported his family in their early years in Upper Canada by running a tavern in Queenston while land was being cleared and roads built in the settlement. The family stayed in Queenston until a log cabin was completed on the settlement in 1796. After Governor Simcoe returned to England in 1796, opposition grew in Upper Canada to the \\"Late Loyalists\\", such as Thomas, who had come to Canada for the land grants. The grants were greatly reduced, and Thomas's contract was cancelled for not having all of its conditions fulfilled. Feeling cheated, in 1805 he moved the family to Credit River, close to York (present-day Toronto), where he successfully ran an inn until his 1812 death following a stroke. Sally continued to run it until her own death in 1833. Laura Ingersoll remained in Queenston when the family moved. She married the wealthy James Secord, likely in June 1797. The Secord family originated in France, where the name was spelled D'Secor or Sicar. Five Secord brothers, who were Protestant Huguenots, fled from persecution in France and founded New Rochelle, New York in 1688. At the time of the American Revolution, Loyalist members of the family anglicized their surname to Secord. The Secord couple lived in a house built in , the first floor of which was a shop. Secord gave birth to her first child, Mary, in St. in 1799. Mary was followed by Charlotte (1801), Harriet (10 February 1803), Charles Badeau (1809 ‚Äì the only male child) and Appolonia (1810). =War of 1812= James Secord served in the 1st Lincoln Militia under Isaac Brock when the War of 1812 broke out. He was among those who helped carry away Brock's body after Brock was killed in the first attack of the Battle of Queenston Heights in October 1812. James himself was severely wounded in the leg and shoulder during the battle. Laura heard of his predicament and rushed to his side. Some sources suggest that she found three American soldiers preparing to beat him to death with their gunstocks. She begged them to save her husband's life, reportedly offering her own in return, when American Captain John E. Wool happened upon the situation and reprimanded the soldiers. This story may have been a later embellishment and may have originated with her grandson, James B. Secord. When the Secords arrived home, they found that the house had been looted in Laura's absence. Spending the winter in St. , Laura spent the next several months nursing her wounded husband back to health. On 27 May 1813, the American army launched an attack across the Niagara River, and captured Fort George. Queenston and the Niagara area fell to the Americans. Men of military age were sent as prisoners to the U.S., though the still-recuperating James Secord was not among them. That June, a number of U.S. soldiers were billeted at the Secords' home. =Secord's walk= Secord warns British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams (Lorne Kidd Smith, ) On the evening of 21 June 1813, Laura Secord heard of plans for a surprise American attack on Lieutenant James FitzGibbon's British troops at Beaver Dams, which would have furthered American control in the Niagara Peninsula. It is unclear how she became aware of these plans. According to tradition she overheard a conversation among the billeted Americans as they ate dinner. As her husband was still recovering from his October injuries, Secord set out early the next morning to warn the Lieutenant. She reportedly walked from present-day Queenston through St. , Homer, Shipman's Corners and Short Hills at the Niagara Escarpment before she arrived at the camp of allied Mohawk warriors, who led her the rest of the way to FitzGibbon's headquarters at the DeCew House. Based on her warning, a small British force and a larger contingent of Mohawk warriors were readied for the American attack. They defeated the Americans, most of whom were casualties or taken prisoner in the Battle of Beaver Dams on 24 June. No mention of Secord was made in reports that immediately followed the battle. =Post-war years= After the war, with the Secords' Queenston store in ruins, the family was impoverished. Only James's small war pension and the rent from 200 acres of land they had in Grantham Township supported them. The Secords' sixth child, Laura Anne, was born in October 1815, and their last child, Hannah, was born in 1817. The Secords' eldest daughter Mary wedded a doctor, William Trumball, on 18 April 1816. On 27 March 1817, Mary gave birth in Ireland to Elizabeth Trumball, the first of Laura and James's grandchildren. Mary had another daughter, also named Mary, in Jamaica. Following her husband's death, Mary returned to Queenston with her children in 1821. Secord was promised a position at Brock's Monument, but the position was given to another woman. (1840 painting by Philip John Bainbrigge) The struggling James petitioned the government in 1827 for some sort of employment. Lieutenant-Governor Peregrine Maitland did not offer him a position, but offered something to Laura. He asked her to be in charge of the yet-to-be-completed Brock's Monument. At first, she turned it down, but then reluctantly accepted it. When Brock's Monument opened in 1831, Secord learned the new Lieutenant-Governor, John Colborne, intended to give the keys to the widow of a member of the monument committee who had died in an accident. On 17 July 1831, Secord petitioned Colborne to honour Maitland's promise, and included another certificate from FitzGibbon attesting her contribution to the war. She wrote that Colonel Thomas Clarke had been told by Maitland, \\"it was too late to think of [the committee member's widow] Mrs. Nichol as I have pledged my word to Mrs. Secord that as soon as possible she should have the key.\\" Despite her pleas, Secord did not receive the keys to the monument. In 1828, the Secords' daughter, Appolonia, died at 18 of typhus, and James was appointed registrar of the Niagara Surrogate Court. He was promoted to judge in 1833, and his son Charles Badeau Secord took over the registrar position. Charles Badeau Secord's first son, Charles Forsyth Secord, was born 9 May 1833. His is the only line of Secords that survived into the 21st century. James became a customs collector in 1835 at the port of Chippawa. The position came with a home in Chippawa, into which the family moved. Charles Badeau Secord took over the Queenston home. Daughter Laura Ann and her son moved into the home in 1837 following her husband's death. =Later life and death= Statue of Laura Secord at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa James Secord died of a stroke on 22 February 1841. He was buried, according to his wishes, at Drummond Hill (now in Niagara Falls). James's death left Laura destitute. When his war pension ended, she was unable to maintain her land as profitable and sold off much of it. Governor-General Sydenham denied a 27 February 1841 petition which she sent, seeking to have her son to take over James's customs position. Sydenham also denied a petition she sent that May for a pension for herself, as James had received a pension for decades. Possibly with help from better-off members of the family, Secord moved to a red brick cottage on Water Street in November 1841. Daughter Harriet and her own two daughters joined her in May 1842, after Harriet's husband died of alcohol poisoning. The three shared quarters with Secord for the rest of her life. Youngest daughter Hannah also moved in when she was widowed in 1844, and brought two daughters with her. Though she lacked training, for a short time Laura Secord ran a small school out of the home in an effort to support herself. This venture came to an end when the public common school system was introduced in the 1840s. Over the years, the Secords unsuccessfully petitioned the government for some kind of acknowledgement. In 1860, when Secord was 85, the Prince of Wales heard of her story while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he learned of Laura Secord's plight as an aging widow and sent an award of ¬£100 (). It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime. Laura Secord died in 1868 at the age of 93. She was interred next to her husband in the Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls. Her grave is marked by a monument with a bust on top, and is close to a monument marking the Battle of Lundy's Lane. The inscription on her grave marker reads: Memory and legend Her granddaughter described Secord as being with brown eyes and a fair complexion. James FitzGibbon wrote she was \\"of slight frame and delicate appearance\\". She was skilled at needlework, dressmaking and cooking. According to biographer Peggy Dymond Leavey, her many grandchildren enjoyed hearing their grandmother tell stories of her early life, and her Anglican faith increased with age. In his report of the battle, FitzGibbon stated only that he \\"received information\\" about the threat; it is possible he omitted mention of Secord to protect her family during wartime. He first wrote of Secord in a certificate dated 26 February 1820, in support of a petition by her husband for a licence to operate a stone quarry in Queenston. In 1827 FitzGibbon wrote: Mohawk warriors (Henry Sandham, ) FitzGibbon wrote in a certificate dated 23 February 1837 that Secord did \\"acquaint\\" him with the Americans' intentions, but does not state whether he used the information. A diary entry of Mohawk chief John Norton talks of \\"a loyal Inhabitant brought information that the Enemy intended to attack\\", but does not name the \\"Inhabitant\\". Dominique Ducharme, leader of the Caughnawaga Mohawk in the Battle of Beaver Dams, made no mention of Secord in his reports, nor of receiving information from either Secord or FitzGibbon about the impending American attack. Secord wrote two accounts of her walk, the first in 1853, and the second in 1861. Neither account contains details that can be corroborated with military accounts of the battle, such as specific dates or details about troops. Her account changed throughout her life. Historian Pierre Berton noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of the impending attack. She told FitzGibbon that her husband had learned about it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord's informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with treason had Secord revealed her source. In the 1860s, as Secord's story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her. A number of historians have questioned Secord's account. W. Stewart Wallace, in his 1932 book, The Story of Laura Secord: A Study in Historical Evidence, concluded her story was mostly myth, and that she played no significant role in the outcome of the Battle of Beaver Dams. Historian George Ingram contended in his 1965 book The Story of Laura Secord Revisited that Secord's debunking had been taken too far. Ruth MacKenzie also burnished Secord's reputation with Laura Secord: The Legend and the Lady in 1971. The question of Secord's actual contribution to the British success has been contested. In the early 1920s, historians suggested that Native scouts had already informed FitzGibbon of the coming attack well before Secord had arrived on 23 June. Historian Ernest Cruikshank wrote in 1895 that \\"Scarcely had Mrs Secord concluded her narrative, when [Ducharme's] scouts came in ... they had encountered the advance guard of the enemy.\\" Later, two testimonials were found which FitzGibbon wrote in 1820 and 1827, which supported Secord's claim. FitzGibbon asserted that Laura Secord had arrived on 22 June (not 23 June), and that \\"in consequence of this information\\", he had been able to intercept the American troops. Legacy Laura Secord Homestead in Queenston According to legend, \\"it took her approximately 17 hours to travel the distance to warn James FitzGibbon of the impending American attack\\". She has often been depicted as \\"a lone figure bravely travelling through approximately 30 km of wilderness from her home at Queenston to a British military detachment camped in DeCew House in what is today Thorold, Ontario.\\" Historian Cecilia Morgan argues that the Secord story became famous in the 1880s when upper-class women sought to strengthen the emotional ties between Canadian women and the British Empire. She writes that they needed a female heroine to validate their claims for women's suffrage. The first product of their campaign was Sarah Anne Curzon's verse drama Laura Secord: The Heroine of 1812 in 1887. The play was a catalyst for \\"a deluge of articles and entries on Secord that filled Canadian histories and school textbooks at the turn of the 20th century\\". Although critics gave the play negative reviews, it was the first full work devoted to Secord's story and popularized her image. Secord has been compared to French-Canadian heroine Madeleine de Verch√®res and to American Revolution hero Paul Revere. Her story has been retold and commemorated by generations of biographers, playwrights, poets, novelists and journalists. Laura Secord Monument in Queenston Heights After discovering a newspaper clipping of the events, early feminist Emma Currie began a lifelong interest in Secord's life. She tracked down information from Laura's relatives as far away as Great Barrington, and published a biographical account in 1900 called The Story of Laura Secord. She later successfully petitioned to have a Secord memorial erected in Queenston Heights. The cut stone granite monument stands and was dedicated in 1901. In 1905, Secord's portrait was hung in Parliament. Playwright Merrill Denison wrote a radio play of her story in 1931 which mixed serious history with parody. On the centennial of Secord's walk in 1913, and to capitalize on Canadian patriotic feelings, Frank O'Connor founded Laura Secord Chocolates. The chain's first location opened on Yonge and Elm streets in Toronto. The chocolates were packaged in black boxes adorned with a cameo of Secord. By the 1970s, the company had become the largest candy retailer in Canada. Among most Canadians, the name Laura Secord is more strongly associated with the chocolate company than with the historical figure. During the War of 1812, the Secords' Queenston homestead was fired upon and looted. It was restored in the late 20th century and given to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1971. It is now operated as a museum and gift shop at Partition and Queen streets in Queenston. The \\"Laura Secord Legacy Trail\\" covers the 32 kilometer route of the journey she undertook from her homestead in Queenston to DeCew House in Thorold where she delivered her message to Lt. Fitzgibbon on 22 June 1813. Thomas Ingersoll's old home on Main Street in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Laura Secord's birthplace, was used as the town's Free Library from 1896 until 1913. The Mason Library replaced it and was built on the site. The Great Barrington Historic District Commission made 18 October 1997 Laura Secord Day, and dedicated a plaque in her honour at the site of the Mason Library. Laura Secord Chocolates commemorated Secord on the centennial of her walk. Laura Secord is the namesake of a number of schools, including Laura Secord Public School (also known as Laura Secord Memorial School, 1914‚Äì2010) in Queenston, √âcole Laura Secord School in Winnipeg, Manitoba (built 1912), Laura Secord Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario and Laura Secord Elementary School in Vancouver, British Columbia. Beaver Dams Battlefield Park has a plaque dedicated to Secord. In 1992, Canada Post issued a Laura Secord commemorative stamp. In 2003, the Minister of Canadian Heritage declared Secord a \\"Person of National Historical Significance\\", and in 2006 Secord's was one of fourteen statues dedicated at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of her walk, Secord's image adorned a circulation quarter issued by the Royal Canadian Mint and a postage stamp from Canada Post.

It can also be the initial tomb for a person who has since been reinterred elsewhere. Although the vast majority of cenotaphs honour individuals, many noted cenotaphs are instead dedicated to the memories of groups of individuals, such as the lost soldiers of a country or of an empire. History and etymology The English word \\"cenotaph\\" derives from the kenotaphion (Œ∫ŒµŒΩœåœÇ kenos, meaning \\"empty\\", and œÑŒ¨œÜŒøœÇ taphos, \\"tomb\\"). Cenotaphs were common in the ancient world. Many were built in Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and across Northern Europe (in the shape of Neolithic barrows). The cenotaph in Whitehall, London ‚Äî designed in 1919 by Sir Edwin Lutyens ‚Äî influenced the design of many other war memorials in Britain and in the British sectors of the Western Front, as well as those in other Commonwealth nations. Lutyen's cenotaph was chosen as a deliberately secular monument. The Church of Santa Engr√°cia, in Lisbon, Portugal, turned into a National Pantheon in 1966, holds six cenotaphs, namely to Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, Afonso de Albuquerque, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, Vasco da Gama and Henry the Navigator. The Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Italy, contains a number of cenotaphs, including one for Dante Alighieri, who is buried in Ravenna. Regional =Africa= South Africa A cenotaph is the focal point of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, South Africa. It is situated below the other main point of interest, a marble Historical Frieze in the Hall of Heroes, and is visible through a round opening in the floor. The Hall of Heroes itself has a dome from the summit of which one can view the interior of the monument. At noon on 16 December each year the sun shines through another opening in the dome onto the middle of the cenotaph, where the words ' (from Die Stem van Suid-Afrika; Afrikaans for \\"We for Thee, South Africa\\") are inscribed. The ray of sunshine symbolises God's blessing on the lives and endeavours of the Voortrekkers. 16 December is the date in 1838 that the Battle of Blood River was fought. Durban, South Africa, has a striking and unusual cenotaph made of granite and lavishly decorated with brightly coloured ceramics. Port Elizabeth, South Africa, has a cenotaph. Located on the edge of St George's Park in Rink Street, it was designed by Elizabeth Gardner to commemorate the men who died in the First World War (1914 - 1918) and was erected by the monumental mason firm of Pennachini Bros. On either side of the central sarcophagus are statues by Technical College Art School principal, James Gardner, who served in the trenches during the war. One depicts St George and the Dragon, the other depicts the sanctity of family life. Surrounding the sarcophagus are a number of bas-relief panels depicting scenes and people during the First World War. It was unveiled by Mrs W F Savage and dedicated by Canon Mayo on 10 November 1929. A surrounding memorial wall commemorates the men and women killed during World War II. Zambia In Livingstone there is a cenotaph at the Eastern Cataract of The Victoria Falls with the names of the men of Northern Rhodesia who died during the Great War 1914‚Äì18. It was unveiled by Prince Arthur of Connaught on 1 August 1923. There is also a cenotaph in Lusaka at Embassy Park, opposite the Cabinet Office along Independence Avenue, and commemorates those Zambians who fought and died in World Wars I & II. The cenotaph was commemorated in 1977.The Zambian Freedom Trail Project, pamphlet phase 1 published with support by U.S. Embassy, Lusaka, Zambia =The Americas= Argentina Monumento a los ca√≠dos en Malvinas (Monument for the fallen in the Falklands War) is located in Plaza San Martin. A monument which has come to be known to as the \\"Cenotaph\\" was erected in Plaza San Mart√≠n, in downtown Buenos Aires, to commemorate the Argentinian soldiers who died during the Falklands War, in 1982. The monument consists of a series of plaques of black marble with the names of the fallen, surrounding a flame, and during the day is guarded by two soldiers. Another cenotaph, which is a replica of the Argentine Military Cemetery in Darwin on the Falkland Islands, exists in Campo de Mayo, a large Army facility and training field just outside Buenos Aires. Bermuda A limestone replica of the Cenotaph at Whitehall in London was erected outside the Cabinet Building in Hamilton, Bermuda in 1920. Canada In Canada, major cenotaphs commemorating the nation's war dead in World War I and later conflicts include the National War Memorial (a cenotaph surmounted by a bronze sculpture entitled \\"The Response\\") in Ottawa; Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, Victoria, St. John's, Halifax, and the Victory Square Cenotaph, in Vancouver, British Columbia. and in Midland Ontario. Falkland Islands Stanley, overlooking Stanley Harbour. In the Falkland Islands, there are several war memorials to commemorate those killed in the Falklands War in 1982. The main memorial for Falkland Islanders is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, a cenotaph erected in Stanley in 1984 which lists all the British Army regiments, RAF squadrons, Royal Navy vessels and the Royal Marine formations and units that took part in the conflict. The names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war are listed on ten plaques behind the Memorial, divided into the service branches. Services are held at the Memorial each year on 14 June (Liberation Day) and on Remembrance Sunday, with wreaths being laid at the foot of the Memorial. United States In the United States, a cenotaph in Yale University's Hewitt Quad (or Beinecke Plaza) honours men of Yale who died in battle. The John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial in Dallas is often described as a cenotaph. The Battle Monument in Baltimore, Maryland commemorates the Battle of Baltimore, the Battle of North Point on 12 September 1814, the Bombardment of Fort McHenry on 13‚Äì14 September, and the stand-off on Loudenschlager's Hill (now Hampstead Hill in Patterson Park). It has an Egyptian Revival cenotaph base, surmounted by a fasces bound together with ribbons bearing the names of the dead. It was designed by French √©migr√© architect Maximilian Godefroy in 1815, and construction was completed in 1827. It is considered the first war memorial in America, and an early example of a memorial to individual soldiers. The Monument appears on the Seal and the Logo of the City of Baltimore, and serves as a symbol for any agencies of the municipal government.Dorsey, John & Dilts, James D., Guide to Baltimore Architecture (1997) p. 145‚Äì146.

Atop War Memorial Chapel at Virginia Tech, there is a cenotaph honouring all Virginia Tech cadets who have been killed in battle. Inscribed upon the cenotaph are the names of the seven Virginia Tech alumni who have been awarded the Medal of Honor. The United States Capitol was constructed with the intention that it house the tomb of George Washington and contains a crypt and burial chamber directly below its rotunda. Due to a disagreement between his family, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the federal government, his body was never moved there, making it a de facto cenotaph. =Asia= In Asia, the Cenotaph in Central District of Hong Kong Island, cenotaphs in Kuala Lumpur, George Town, Ipoh, Seremban and Jesselton in Malaysia, the Cenotaph in Singapore, the Cenotaph in Colombo and the stone Cenotaph in the new Allenby Square, Romema, Jerusalem - were erected as memorials to the war dead of World War I. Various cenotaphs in Asia have also been erected to commemorate the dead from events outside conventional Western coverage. The concrete Memorial Cenotaph at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was designed by Kenzo Tange to commemorate the victims of the August 1945 atomic bomb attacks. The cenotaph at the 228 Peace Memorial Park in Taipei, Taiwan was erected as a memorial to the February 28 incident. In the Philippines, a cenotaph was erected inside the Manila North Cemetery in honour of the 24 Scouts who died in a plane crash en route to the 11th World Scout Jamboree. =Europe= Armenia Tsitsernakaberd Genocide Memorial - The Armenian Genocide memorial complex is Armenia's official memorial dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, built in 1967 on the hill of Tsitsernakaberd (‘æ’´’Æ’•’º’∂’°’Ø’°’¢’•÷Ä’§) in Yerevan.

France Cenotaph of Michel de Montaigne, Museum of Aquitaine, Bordeaux. In the Museum of Aquitaine, in Bordeaux, there is the famous cenotaph of Michel de Montaigne, a French Renaissance writer and philosopher. The tomb was sculpted in 1593, a year after his death on the request of his wife, Fran√ßoise de la Chassaigne, probably by Prieur and Guillerman, two Bordeaux ornamentists.http://www.musee- aquitaine-bordeaux.fr/en/article/montaignes-tomb On the cenotaph, next to the coat of arm, there are two epitaphs, in Greek and in Latin.

It was intended to commemorate specifically the victims of the First World War, but is used to commemorate all of the dead in all wars in which British servicemen and women have fought. The dates of the First World War and the Second World War are inscribed on it in Roman numerals. The design was used in the construction of many other war memorials throughout the British Empire. =Belfast= The Cenotaph in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is located in the grounds of Belfast City Hall and is set within a Garden of Remembrance. It is about high and presents several carvings including laurel wreaths, symbolising victory and honour. The Cenotaph is the site of the annual Northern Ireland memorial held on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November (Armistice Day). =The Middle East= Jerusalem Ottoman-ruled Jerusalem surrendered to the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force under General Edmund Allenby during the Battle of Jerusalem in December 1917 during World War I. A cenotaph was erected in 1920 at the historical site of the surrender, later to be named Allenby Square. The inscription dedicates it to the fallen of the 60th London Division. =Oceania= Australia In Australia, Anzac Day commemorations are usually held at all of the nation's many war memorials, but not all of them are cenotaphs. Cenotaphs include the Hobart Cenotaph and the Sydney Cenotaph. New Zealand Anzac Day commemorations are usually held at local war memorials as in Australia. Cenotaphs include the Dunedin Cenotaph and the Wellington Cenotaph. Cenotaphs for the missing Although most notable cenotaphs commemorate notable individuals buried elsewhere, many cenotaphs pay tribute to people whose remains have never been located, particularly those lost at sea. Some such cenotaphs are dedicated to victims of the RMS Titanic whose bodies were not recovered after the sinking. Although Isidor Straus's body was recovered, Ida Straus's body was not, and a cenotaph at the Straus Mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx is dedicated to Isidor and Ida together. Its inscription reads: \\"Many waters cannot quench love - neither can the floods drown it.\\"\\"Many Waters Cannot Quench Love\\" http://www.straushistoricalsociety.org/documents.html () The striking cenotaph of Major Archibald Butt, aide to U.S. President William Taft, is located at Arlington National Cemetery. In Inishmore, one of the Aran Islands of Ireland, drowning was formerly such a common cause of death for island fishermen that each family had a memorial to those lost at sea known as leachta√≠ cuimhneach√°in (memorial cairns). Most were erected in the 19th century, although some date back to the eighteenth. A modern memorial was erected in 1997. Chhatris Moosi Rani ki Chatri, Alwar In India, cenotaphs are a basic element of Hindu architecture, later used by Moghuls as seen in most of the mausoleums of Mughal Emperors which have two burial chambers, the upper one with a cenotaph, as in Humayun's Tomb, Delhi, or the Taj Mahal, Agra, while the real tomb often lies exactly below it, or further removed. The term chhatri, used for these canopylike structures, comes from Hindustani word literally meaning umbrella, and are found throughout the northwestern region of Rajasthan as well as in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, chhatris are built on the cremation sites of wealthy or distinguished individuals. Chhatris in Shekhawati may consist of a simple structure of one dome raised by four pillars to a building containing many domes and a basement with several rooms. In some places, the interior of the chhatri is painted in the same manner as the Haveli. Art Cenotaphs have also been the subject of a number of illustrations including: * The Cenotaph to Reynold's Memory (John Constable, c. 1833) * Elevation for Newton's Cenotaph, Perspective (Etienne-Louis Boull√©e, c. 1785) * The Cenotaph of Jean Jacques Rousseau (Hubert Robert, 1794) Poetry Cenotaph is used in Henry Ellison's (1833) poem, Scientific Theories: O Science! proud Iconoclast, thy way Is strewed with fragments of our reverence And love‚Äîidols with small or no pretence, Right oft, upon their pedestals to stay, The light oft intercepting of God's day, E'en in His Temple! Light too pure, intense, Which puts the eye out, dazzles the weak sense Of mere Humanity, after its clay Shaping its images. But take thou good heed Thou dost not, in self-blindness and self- pride, Pluck down the Temple's self, and, in its stead And on its ruins, strewed far and wide, Building as not for Living but True-dead, A cenotaph for Man's lost Soul provide! Mentioned in Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf Digital and astronomical In the Internet age, virtual cenotaphs are common in the game World of Warcraft. and in The Elder Scrolls Series games though modding add ons. They have also been created in the augmented reality game Ingress in honour of the slain MIT police officer Sean Collier and in memory of the victims of the 1942 Struma disaster.

In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in each of London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (Le Bon March√©) and in New York (Stewart's).Gunther Barth, \\"The Department Store,\\" in City People: The Rise of Modern City Culture in Nineteenth-Century America. (Oxford University Press, 1980) pp 110‚Äì47, Today, departments often include the following: clothing, furniture, home appliances, toys, cosmetics, houseware, gardening, toiletries, sporting goods, do it yourself, paint, and hardware. Additionally, other lines of products such as food, books, jewelry, electronics, stationery, photographic equipment, baby products, and products for pets are sometimes included. Customers generally check out near the front of the store in discount department stores, while higher-end traditional department stores include sales counters within each department. Some stores are one of many within a larger retail chain, while others are independent retailers. In the 1970s, they came under heavy pressure from discounters, and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since 2010. Types In the United States, department stores are categorized into the following types: * Mainline department store or simply, the traditional department store, offering mid- to high-end goods, most or at least some of the time at the full retail price. Examples are Macy's, Bloomingdales, J.C. Penney and Belk. **Junior department store, a term used principally in the second part of the 20th century for a smaller version of a mainline department store. These were usually either independent stores, or chains that specialized in cosmetics and wearing apparel and accessories, with few home goods. such as Boston Store and Harris & Frank * Discount department store, a large discount store selling apparel and home furnishings at a discount, either selling overstock from mainline department stores, or merchandise especially made for the discount department store market. Examples are Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off 5th, Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less, and Kohl's.http://finance.yahoo.com/news/off-price-black- retailers-202300176.html Some sources may refer to the following types of stores as department stores, even they are not generally considered as such: *Hypermarkets (discount superstores with full grocery offerings, such as Target, Walmart and Carrefour)‚ÄùHypermarket‚Äù, Investopedia *Variety stores, also known in the U.S. as five and dimes History Harding, Howell & Co., a contender for the title of first department store in the world The origins of the department store are disputed. Some sources consider the origins to be dry goods stores in general, a type of store that has roots in many countries. As these dry-goods stores became larger and more complex and more aspirational, the inspiration was especially the department stores of Paris, such as The Bon March√© opened in 1852, Printemps (1865) and the Samaritaine (1869).\\"Department store\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica However BBC contends that the first department store was Harding, Howell & Co.‚Äôs Grand Fashionable Magazine at 89 Pall Mall in St James's, London.\\"A History of the Department Store\\", BBC Culture, 2015 =Origins in England, 1700s= One of the first department stores may have been Bennett's in Derby, first established as an ironmonger (hardware shop) in 1734. It still stands to this day, trading in the same building. However, the first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell & Co., which opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London. An observer writing in Ackermann's Repository, a British periodical on contemporary taste and fashion, described the enterprise in 1809 as follows: > The house is one hundred and fifty feet in length from front to back, and of > proportionate width. It is fitted up with great taste, and is divided by > glazed partitions into four departments, for the various branches of the > extensive business, which is there carried on. Immediately at the entrance > is the first department, which is exclusively appropriated to the sale of > furs and fans. The second contains articles of haberdashery of every > description, silks, muslins, lace, gloves, &etc.; In the third shop, on the > right, you meet with a rich assortment of jewelry, ornamental articles in > ormolu, French clocks, &etc.; and on the left, with all the different kinds > of perfumery necessary for the toilette. The fourth is set apart for > millinery and dresses; so that there is no article of female attire or > decoration, but what may be here procured in the first style of elegance and > fashion. This concern has been conducted for the last twelve years by the > present proprietors who have spared neither trouble nor expense to ensure > the establishment of a superiority over every other in Europe, and to render > it perfectly unique in its kind. This venture is described as having all of the basic characteristics of the department store; it was a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century. Increasingly, women became the main customers.Alison Adburgham, Shops and Shopping, 1880‚Äì1914: Where and in What Matter the Well-Dressed Englishwoman Bought Her Clothes (2nd ed. 1981) Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal's, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser. The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796. Harrods of London can be traced back to 1834, though the current store was built between 1894 and 1905. Liberty & Co. gained popularity in the 1870s for selling Oriental goods.Iarocci, L., Visual Merchandising: The Image of Selling, Ashgate Publishing, 2013, p. 128 =Origins in Parisian magasins de nouveaut√©s= Au Bon March√© The Paris department stores have roots in the magasin de nouveaut√©s, or novelty store; the first, the Tapis Rouge, was created in 1784,. They flourished in the early 19th century. Balzac described their functioning in his novel C√©sar Birotteau. In the 1840s, with the arrival of the railroads in Paris and the increased number of shoppers they brought, they grew in size, and began to have large plate glass display windows, fixed prices and price tags, and advertising in newspapers. A novelty shop called Au Bon March√© had been founded in Paris in 1838 to sell items like lace, ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, and umbrellas. It grew from and 12 employees in 1838 to and 1,788 employees in 1879. Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; extensive newspaper advertising; entertainment for children; and six million catalogs sent out to customers. By 1880 half the employees were women; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors. Au Bon March√© soon had half a dozen or more competitors including Printemps, founded in 1865; La Samaritaine (1869), Bazaar de Hotel de Ville (BHV); and Galeries Lafayette (1895).Fierro (1996), pages 911‚Äì912Michael B. Miller, Bon March√©: Bourgeois Culture and the Department Store, 1869‚Äì1920 (1981) The French gloried in the national prestige brought by the great Parisian stores.Heidrun Homburg, \\"Warenhausunternehmen und ihre Gr√ºnder in Frankreich und Deutschland Oder: Eine Diskrete Elite und Mancherlei Mythen,\\" [Department store firms and their founders in France and Germany, or: a discreet elite and various myths]. Jahrbuch fuer Wirtschaftsgeschichte (1992), Issue 1, pp 183‚Äì219. The great writer √âmile Zola (1840‚Äì1902) set his novel Au Bonheur des Dames (1882‚Äì83) in the typical department store, making it a symbol of the new technology that was both improving society and devouring it.Frans C. Amelinckx, \\"The Creation of Consumer Society in Zola's Ladies' Paradise,\\" Proceedings of the Western Society for French History (1995), Vol. 22, pp 17‚Äì21. =First American department stores (1825‚Äì1858)= Arnold Constable was the first American department store. It was founded in 1825 as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War, Arnold Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis. The store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this ‚ÄúPalace of Trade‚Äù expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914. Financial problems led to bankruptcy in 1975.\\"The Arnold Constable & Company Buildings\\" May 16, 2013 In New York City in 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established the \\"Marble Palace\\" on Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets. He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing \\"free entrance\\" to all potential customers. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block uptown between 9th and 10th streets, with eight floors. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. In 1858, Rowland Hussey Macy founded Macy's as a dry goods store. =Innovations 1850-1917= Marshall Field's State Street store \\"great hall\\" interior around 1910 Marshall Field & Company originated in 1852. It was the premier department store on the busiest shopping street in the Midwest at the time, State Street in Chicago.Lloyd Wendt and Herman Kogan, Give the Lady What She Wants: The Story of Marshall Field & Company (1952) Marshall Field's served as a model for other department stores in that it had exceptional customer service. Marshall Field's also had the firsts; among many innovations by Marshall Field's were the first European buying office, which was located in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. The company was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, and that service was provided without charge in every Field's store, until the chain's last days under the Marshall Field's name. It was the first store to offer revolving credit and the first department store to use escalators. Marshall Field's book department in the State Street store was legendary; it pioneered the concept of the \\"book signing\\". Moreover, every year at Christmas, Marshall Field's downtown store windows were filled with animated displays as part of the downtown shopping district display; the \\"theme\\" window displays became famous for their ingenuity and beauty, and visiting the Marshall Field's windows at Christmas became a tradition for Chicagoans and visitors alike, as popular a local practice as visiting the Walnut Room with its equally famous Christmas tree or meeting \\"under the clock\\" on State Street.Wendt and Kogan, Give the Lady What She Wants: The Story of Marshall Field & Company (1952) In 1877, John Wanamaker opened what some claim was the United States' first \\"modern\\" department store in Philadelphia: the first to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination (1878), the telephone (1879), and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents (1880) to the department store business.Robert Sobel, The Entrepreneurs: Explorations Within the American Business Tradition (1974), chapter 3, \\"John Wanamaker: The Triumph of Content Over Form\\" Selfridges, Oxford Street in London, 1944 Another store to revolutionize the concept of the department store was Selfridges in London, established in 1909 by American-born Harry Gordon Selfridge on Oxford Street. The company's innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through paid advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and \\"Colonial\\" customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise.J.A. Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks, Oxford University Press, 1981 Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; in 1909, Louis Bl√©riot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Bl√©riot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925. Utagawa Hiroshige designed an ukiyo-e print with Mt. Fuji and Echigoya as landmarks. Echigoya is the former name of Mitsukoshi named after the former province of Echigo. The Mitsukoshi headquarters are located on the left side of the street. In Japan, the first \\"modern-style\\" department store was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. Matsuzakaya corporate history These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or instead displayed, luxurious products, which contributed to their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of the Japanese department store is from railway companies. There have been many private railway operators in the nation and, from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' termini. Seibu and Hankyu are typical examples of this type. =Innovation (1917-1945)= =Expansion to malls= =Expansion worldwide= =Current situation= Around the world See also * Department stores around the world * List of department stores by country * Distribution, Retail, Marketing * History of retailing in the modern era * Types of retail outlets References Further reading * Abelson, Elaine S.

Thus it was an example of an embodied agent. It came preinstalled as part of Windows 98 through Windows Vista. It was not included with Windows 7 but can be downloaded from Microsoft. It was completely discontinued in Windows 8. Microsoft Agent functionality was exposed as an ActiveX control that can be used by web pages. The theory behind this software came from work on social interfaces by Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information. Version history Interactive character technology was first introduced in Microsoft Bob, which used an early version of Agent technology internally referred to as \\"Microsoft Actor.\\" It was the code used in initial version of the Office Assistant in Office 97. Microsoft Agent was subsequently created by Tandy Trower in an attempt to offer technology that was more flexible and available to third-party developers to include in their applications and web pages. The software release also included four interactive characters as well as a utility that enables developers to assemble their own characters and interactions. Microsoft Agent replaced the original Microsoft Bob code in Office 2000, although this use did not include Agent's much-touted speech synthesis or recognition capabilities or any of the four Microsoft Agent characters. Instead the Office team created their own characters including one dubbed \\"Clippit\\" or \\"Clippy\\". However, Bob Actors or Office 97 assistants are incompatible with Office 2000 and later versions, and vice versa. The current version of Microsoft Agent was quietly released on MSDN in 1997. Technology Microsoft Agent characters are stored in files of the .ACS extension, and can be stored in a number of compressed .ACF files for better World Wide Web distribution. Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Bob Actor characters are stored in files of the .ACT extension. The speech engine itself is driven by the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4 and above. Microsoft SAPI provides a control panel for easily installing and switching between various available Text to Speech and Speech to Text engines, as well as voice training and scoring systems to improve the quality and accuracy of both engines. Microsoft provides four agent characters for free, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft Agent website. These are called Peedy, Merlin, Genie, and Robby. Some characters also shipped with Microsoft Office up to version 2003 as the Office Assistants and with Windows XP as search assistants. New Agent characters can also be created using Microsoft's development tools, including the Agent Character Editor. Agents can be embedded in software with Visual Basic for Applications and in web pages with VBScript, and automated tools for the purpose of simplifying this exist. However, web page agents are only compatible with Internet Explorer, since alternative browsers like Opera or Mozilla Firefox do not support ActiveX. Additionally, users of Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP and later or owners of Microsoft Office 2000 and later are the only ones who have Agent software pre-loaded on their computers; others have to download the software and install it manually. Support after Windows XP In Windows Vista, Microsoft Agent uses Speech API (SAPI) version 5.3 as its primary text-to- speech provider. (In previous versions of Windows, Agent uses SAPI version 4, which is not supported in Windows Vista and later.) Beginning with Vista, multilingual features of Microsoft Agent under a particular language version of the OS are not supported; that is, Agent will function in other languages only under a localized Windows version of the same language. Microsoft announced in April 2009 that all Microsoft Agent development and support will be discontinued with the release of Windows 7. Microsoft is no longer offering licenses or distributing the SDK. However, due to customer feedback, Microsoft has provided an installation package of the Microsoft Agent core components for use on Windows 7. The download supports SAPI 5.3 compatible speech engines, and also contains the character ‚ÄúMerlin‚Äù, which shipped with Windows Vista.

The fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that there is a unique connection which satisfies these properties. In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds the term covariant derivative is often used for the Levi-Civita connection. The components of this connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called Christoffel symbols. History The Levi-Civita connection is named after Tullio Levi-Civita, although originally \\"discovered\\" by Elwin Bruno Christoffel. Levi-Civita, along with Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, used Christoffel's symbols to define the notion of parallel transport and explore the relationship of parallel transport with the curvature, thus developing the modern notion of holonomy.See The Levi-Civita notions of intrinsic derivative and parallel displacement of a vector along a curve make sense on an abstract Riemannian manifold, even though the original motivation relied on a specific embedding :M^n \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{R}^{\\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}, since the definition of the Christoffel symbols make sense in any Riemannian manifold. In 1869, Christoffel discovered that the components of the intrinsic derivative of a vector transform as the components of a contravariant vector. This discovery was the real beginning of tensor analysis. It was not until 1917 that Levi-Civita interpreted the intrinsic derivative in the case of an embedded surface as the tangential component of the usual derivative in the ambient affine space. =Remark= In 1906, L. E. J. Brouwer was the first mathematician to consider the parallel transport of a vector for the case of a space of constant curvature. In 1917, Levi-Civita pointed out its importance for the case of a hypersurface immersed in a Euclidean space, i.e., for the case of a Riemannian manifold embedded in a \\"larger\\" ambient space. In 1918, independently of Levi-Civita, Jan Arnoldus Schouten obtained analogous results. In the same year, Hermann Weyl generalized Levi-Civita's results. Notation * denotes a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold. * is the tangent bundle of . * is the Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric of . * are smooth vector fields on , i. e. smooth sections of . * is the Lie bracket of and . It is again a smooth vector field. The metric can take up to two vectors or vector fields as arguments. In the former case the output is a number, the (pseudo-)inner product of and . In the latter case, the inner product of is taken at all points on the manifold so that defines a smooth function on . Vector fields act (by definition) as differential operators on smooth functions. In a local coordinates (x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n) , the action reads :X(f) = X^i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i}f = X^i\\\\partial_i f where Einstein's summation convention is used. Formal definition An affine connection is called a Levi-Civita connection if # it preserves the metric, i.e., . # it is torsion- free, i.e., for any vector fields and we have , where is the Lie bracket of the vector fields and . Condition 1 above is sometimes referred to as compatibility with the metric, and condition 2 is sometimes called symmetry, cf. Do Carmo's text. Fundamental theorem of (pseudo) Riemannian Geometry Theorem Every pseudo Riemannian manifold (M,g) has a unique Levi Civita connection abla. proof: If a Levi-Civita connection exists, it must be unique. To see this, unravel the definition of the action of a connection on tensors to find : X\\\\bigl(g(Y,Z)\\\\bigr) = ( abla_X g)(Y, Z) + g( abla_X Y, Z) + g( Y, abla_X Z). Hence we can write condition 1 as : X\\\\bigl(g(Y,Z)\\\\bigr) = g( abla_X Y, Z) + g( Y, abla_X Z). By the symmetry of the metric tensor g we then find: : X \\\\bigl(g(Y,Z)\\\\bigr) + Y \\\\bigl(g(Z,X)\\\\bigr) - Z \\\\bigl(g(Y,X)\\\\bigr) = g( abla_X Y + abla_Y X, Z) + g( abla_X Z - abla_Z X, Y) + g( abla_Y Z - abla_Z Y, X). By condition 2, the right hand side is therefore equal to : 2g( abla_X Y, Z) - g([X,Y], Z) + g([X,Z], Y) + g([Y,Z], X), and we find the Koszul formula : g( abla_X Y, Z) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{ X \\\\bigl(g(Y,Z)\\\\bigr) + Y \\\\bigl(g(Z,X)\\\\bigr) - Z \\\\bigl(g(X,Y)\\\\bigr) + g([X,Y],Z) - g([Y,Z], X) - g([X,Z], Y) \\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. Hence, if a Levi-Civita connection exists, it must be unique, because Z is arbitrary, g is non degenerate, and the right hand side does not depend abla. To prove existence, note that for given vector field X and Y, the right hand side of the Koszul expression is function-linear in the vector field Z, not just real linear. Hence by the non degeneracy of g, the right hand side uniquely defines some new vector field which we suggestively denote abla_X Y as in the left hand side. By substituting the Koszul formula, one now checks that for all vector fields X, Y,Z, and all functions f : g( abla_X (Y_1 + Y_2), Z) = g( abla_X Y_1, Z) + g( abla_X Y_2 , Z) : g( abla_X (f Y), Z) = X(f) g(Y, Z) + f g( abla_X Y,Z) : g( abla_X Y, Z) + g( abla_X Z, Y) = X\\\\bigl(g(Y,Z)\\\\bigr) : g( abla_X Y, Z) - g( abla_Y X, Z) = g([X,Y], Z). Hence the Koszul expression does, in fact, define a connection, and this connection is compatible with the metric and is torsion free, i.e. is a (hence the) Levi-Civita connection. Note that with minor variations the same proof shows that there is a unique connection that is compatible with the metric and has prescribed torsion. Christoffel symbols Let abla be an affine connection on the tangent bundle. Choose local coordinates x^1, \\\\ldots, x^n with coordinate basis vector fields \\\\partial_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\partial_n and write abla_j for abla_{\\\\partial_j}. The Christoffel symbols \\\\Gamma^l_{jk} of abla with respect to these coordinates are defined as : abla_j\\\\partial_k = \\\\Gamma^l_{jk} \\\\partial_l The Christoffel symbols conversely define the connection abla on the coordinate neighbourhood because : abla_X Y = abla_{X^j\\\\partial_j} Y = X^j abla_j Y = X^j abla_j(Y^k\\\\partial_k) = X^j\\\\bigl(\\\\partial_j(Y^k)\\\\partial_k + Y^k abla_j\\\\partial_k\\\\bigr) = X^j\\\\bigl(\\\\partial_j(Y^k)\\\\partial_k + Y^k\\\\Gamma^l_{jk}\\\\partial_l\\\\bigr) = X^j\\\\bigl(\\\\partial_j(Y^l) + Y^k\\\\Gamma^l_{jk}\\\\bigr)\\\\partial_l ie. : ( abla_j Y)^l = \\\\partial_jY^l + \\\\Gamma^l_{jk} Y^k An affine connection abla is compatible with a metric iff : \\\\partial_i \\\\bigl(g(\\\\partial_j, \\\\partial_k) \\\\bigr) = g( abla_i\\\\partial_j, \\\\partial_k) + g(\\\\partial_j, abla_i\\\\partial_k) = g(\\\\Gamma^l_{ij}\\\\partial_l, \\\\partial_k) + g(\\\\partial_j, \\\\Gamma_{ik}^l\\\\partial_l) i.e. iff : \\\\partial_i g_{jk} = \\\\Gamma^l_{ij}g_{lk} + \\\\Gamma^l_{ik}g_{jl}. An affine connection is torsion free iff : abla_i\\\\partial_j - abla_j \\\\partial_i = (\\\\Gamma^l_{jk} - \\\\Gamma^l_{kj})\\\\partial_l = [\\\\partial_i, \\\\partial_j]= 0. i.e. iff :\\\\Gamma^l_{jk} = \\\\Gamma^l_{kj} is symmetric in its lower two indices. As one checks by taking for X, Y, Z, coordinate vectorfields \\\\partial_j, \\\\partial_k, \\\\partial_l (or computes directly), the Koszul expression of the Levi-Civita connection derived above is equivalent to a definition of the Christoffel symbols in terms of the metric as :\\\\Gamma^l_{jk} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} g^{lr} \\\\left( \\\\partial _k g_{rj} + \\\\partial _j g_{rk} - \\\\partial _r g_{jk} \\\\right) where as usual g^{ij} are the coefficients of the dual metric tensor, i.e. the entries of the inverse of the matrix g_{kl}. Derivative along curve The Levi- Civita connection (like any affine connection) also defines a derivative along curves, sometimes denoted by . Given a smooth curve on and a vector field along its derivative is defined by :D_tV= abla_{\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t)}V. Formally, is the pullback connection on the pullback bundle . In particular, \\\\dot\\\\gamma(t) is a vector field along the curve itself. If abla_{\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}(t)}\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}(t) vanishes, the curve is called a geodesic of the covariant derivative. Formally, the condition can be restated as the vanishing of the pullback connection applied to \\\\dot\\\\gamma: :\\\\left(\\\\gamma^* abla\\\\right) \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}\\\\equiv 0. If the covariant derivative is the Levi-Civita connection of a certain metric, then the geodesics for the connection are precisely those geodesics of the metric that are parametrised proportionally to their arc length. Parallel transport In general, parallel transport along a curve with respect to a connection defines isomorphisms between the tangent spaces at the points of the curve. If the connection is a Levi-Civita connection, then these isomorphisms are orthogonal ‚Äì that is, they preserve the inner products on the various tangent spaces. The images below show parallel transport of the Levi-Civita connection associated to two different Riemannian metrics on the plane, expressed in polar coordinates. The metric of left image corresponds to the standard Euclidean metric ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\\\theta^2, while the metric on the right has standard form in polar coordinates, and thus preserves the vector {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} tangent to the circle. This second metric has a singularity at the origin, as can be seen by expressing it in Cartesian coordinates: : dr = \\\\frac{xdx + ydy}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} : d\\\\theta = \\\\frac{xdy - ydx}{x^2 + y^2} : dr^2 + d\\\\theta^2 = \\\\frac{(xdx + ydy)^2}{x^2+y^2} + \\\\frac{(xdy - ydx)^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2} Example: the unit sphere in  Let be the usual scalar product on . Let be the unit sphere in . The tangent space to at a point is naturally identified with the vector subspace of consisting of all vectors orthogonal to . It follows that a vector field on can be seen as a map , which satisfies :\\\\bigl\\\\langle Y(m), m\\\\bigr\\\\rangle = 0, \\\\qquad \\\\forall m\\\\in \\\\mathbf{S}^2. Denote as the covariant derivative of the map in the direction of the vector . Then we have: :Lemma: The formula ::\\\\left( abla_X Y\\\\right)(m) = d_mY(X) + \\\\langle X(m),Y(m)\\\\rangle m :defines an affine connection on with vanishing torsion. :Proof: It is straightforward to prove that satisfies the Leibniz identity and is linear in the first variable. It is also a straightforward computation to show that this connection is torsion free. So all that needs to be proved here is that the formula above does indeed define a vector field. That is, we need to prove that for all in ::\\\\bigl\\\\langle\\\\left( abla_X Y\\\\right)(m),m\\\\bigr\\\\rangle = 0\\\\qquad (1). :Consider the map that sends every in to , which is always 0. The map is constant, hence its differential vanishes. In particular ::d_mf(X) = \\\\bigl\\\\langle d_m Y(X),m\\\\bigr\\\\rangle + \\\\bigl\\\\langle Y(m), X(m)\\\\bigr\\\\rangle = 0. :The equation (1) above follows. Q.E.D. In fact, this connection is the Levi- Civita connection for the metric on inherited from . Indeed, one can check that this connection preserves the metric.

In other words, it is a small airport suitable for use by helicopters and some other vertical lift platforms. Designated heliports typically contain one or more touchdown and liftoff area and may also have limited facilities such as fuel or hangars. In some larger towns and cities, customs facilities may also be available. Early advocates of helicopters hoped that heliports would become widespread, but they have become contentious in urban areas due to the excessive noise caused by helicopter traffic. Other terms used to refer to a heliport are: * Helistop - A term sometimes used to describe a minimally developed heliport for boarding and discharging passengers or cargo. * Helipad - A term oftentimes confused with heliport or helistop. The only reference of this term in the U.S. by the FAA is found in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) Pilot/Controller Glossary of Terms, which says: A small, designated area, usually with a prepared surface, on a heliport, airport, landing/takeoff area, apron/ramp, or movement area used for takeoff, landing, or parking of helicopters. In other words, the TLOF. * Helideck - Used to describe the landing area on a vessel or offshore structure on which helicopters may land and take off.  Heliport airspace  The airspace immediately surrounding the heliport is called the Primary Surface. This area coincides in shape and size with the designated take-off and landing area. This surface is a horizontal plane equal to the elevation of the established heliport elevation. The Primary Surface is further broken down into three distinct regions. These are, the Touchdown and Liftoff (TLOF) area, the Final Approach and Takeoff (FATO) area and the Safety Area. The TLOF is a load- bearing, generally paved area, normally centered in the FATO, on which the helicopter lands and/or takes off. The FATO is a defined area over which the pilot completes the final phase of the approach to a hover or a landing and from which the pilot initiates takeoff. The FATO elevation is the lowest elevation of the edge of the TLOF. The Safety Area is a defined area on a heliport surrounding the FATO intended to reduce the risk of damage to helicopters accidentally diverging from the FATO. Purpose Rooftop hospital heliport In a large metropolitan and urban areas a heliport can serve passengers needing to quickly move within the city or to outlying regions. Generally heliports can be situated closer to a town or city center than an airport for fixed-wing aircraft. The advantage in flying by helicopter to a destination or even to the city's main airport is that travel can be much faster than driving. As an example, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in New York City provides scheduled service to John F. Kennedy International Airport and is used to move wealthy persons and important goods quickly to destinations as far away as Maryland. Some skyscrapers feature rooftop heliports or helistops to serve the transport needs of executives or clients. Many of these rooftop sites also serve as Emergency Helicopter Landing Facilities (EHLF) in case emergency evacuation is needed. The U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles is an example. Police departments use heliports as a base for police helicopters, and larger departments may have a dedicated large heliport facility dedicated such as the LAPD Hooper Heliport. Heliports are common features at hospitals where they serve to facilitate Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) and MEDEVACs for transferring patients into and out of hospital facilities. Some large trauma centers have multiple heliports while most small hospitals have just one. Heliports allow hospitals to accept patients that may be flown in from remote accident sites where there are no local hospitals or facilities capable of providing the level of emergency care required. The National EMS Pilots Association (NEMSPA) has published multiple white papers, surveys and safety recommendations for the enhancement of hospital heliport operations to improve patient safety. Heliport markings  Heliport markings While heliports can be oriented in any direction they will generally have very definitive approach and departure paths. However, heliports are not numbered in the same way that runways at airports are. Recommended standard practice by both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is to orient an H in the center of the TLOF in line with the preferred approach/departure direction. An information box should also be included in the TLOF area which provides the maximum gross weight the heliport is rated for as well as the maximum size helicopter the heliport has been designed to accommodated which is based on the Rotor Diameter and Overall Length of the largest design helicopter that will service the heliport. Under normal conditions it is standard practice to paint the maximum gross weight a heliport is designed to support in thousands of pounds. along with the maximum helicopter dimensions in feet. Arrows are oftentimes painted on the heliport to indicate to pilots the preferred approach/departure paths. Other common markings can include ownership, radio frequencies, company logos and magnetic north. Lighting To conduct nighttime operations at a heliport it must have lighting installed that meets specific aeronautical standards. Heliport perimeter lights are generally installed around the TLOF area and may be flush mounted on the TLOF itself or mounted just off the TLOF perimeter on short metal or concrete extensions. One alternative to lighting the TLOF if certain criteria is met is to light the area of the FATO instead. Some locations, due to environmental conditions, illuminate the TLOF and FATO. Lighting should never constitute an obstruction that a helicopter may impact and for this reason in the U.S. heliport lighting is not allowed to extend above the TLOF or FATO more than 2 inches. Current standards recommend that all perimeter lighting be green. Prior standards recommended amber lighting for perimeter lights however this wavelength has been shown to interfere with night vision goggle (NVG) operations when used with older incandescent lighting. In the past lighting has been traditionally incandescent but increasingly light emitting diodes (LEDs) are being incorporated due to lower power requirements and increased life. While flood lights may be used to enhance surface operations they should not interfere with flight crew night vision and should be kept off during flight operations and only used when conducting ground movement operations. To conduct night operations a lighted wind cone is also required. At ground-based heliports, lead-in lights may be incorporated to identify the preferred approach/departure direction. Visual slope guidance systems (such as HAPI, PAPI, etc.) are recommended options in both ICAO and FAA document. While airports commonly use 6.6A direct current power, heliport lighting is normally AC powered. Radio control of the lighting by the pilot via an automated ground-based controller is also common.  Approach/departure airspace  To provide for a safe environment to perform normal helicopter landing and takeoff operations each heliport must have unobstructed approach/departure paths. At a minimum the FAA recommends that there should be two approach departure path so that pilots have viable unobstructed routes into and out of a heliport under multiple wind conditions. The minimum recommended separation between flight paths is 135 degrees. A heliport approach path is broken down into two distinct airspace surfaces, the Approach Surface and the Transitional Surface. The approach surface begins at each end of the heliport primary surface with the same width as the primary surface, and extends outward and upward for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet where its width is 500 feet. The slope of the approach surface is 8 to 1 for civil heliports. The Transitional Surfaces extend outward and upward from the lateral boundaries of the primary surface and from the approach surfaces at a slope of 2 to 1 for a distance of 250 feet measured horizontally from the centerline of the primary and approach surfaces. Approach paths can either be straight or curved to accommodate obstructions and avoidance areas.

April is a fictional character in the Star Trek universe. April is listed in the Star Trek Chronology, The Star Trek Encyclopedia and at startrek.com as the Enterprise's first commanding officer, preceding Captain Christopher Pike. The character's only television/movie appearance is in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"The Counter-Clock Incident\\", in which he is voiced by James Doohan and portrayed as the first captain of the USS Enterprise. Initially, the decision was made by Paramount Pictures, studio owners of the franchise, and series creator Gene Roddenberry not to consider the animated series to be part of the official Star Trek canon; that decision, for the longest time, had led to debate as to whether April's place as first captain is actually a part of Star Trek continuity. However, \\"April, Robert\\" is listed in an alphabetical list of most-decorated Starfleet captains in the Star Trek: Discovery 2017 episode \\"Choose Your Pain\\". On June 27, 2007, Star Treks official site incorporated information from The Animated Series into its library section, clarifying, finally, that the animated series is indeed part of the Star Trek canon. Both David Gerrold and D. C. Fontana have stated that the animated series is essentially the fourth season that fans wanted originally.Silverman, D. S. (2015). \\"Always Bring Phasers to an 'Animated' Canon Fight: Star Treks Animated Adventures on Saturday Mornings\\". In D. Brode & S. Brode (Eds.) Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek: The Original Cast Adventures. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow. April appears in the novels Final Frontier and Best Destiny by Diane Carey as the captain of the Enterprise. Pilot development A collage in the Star Trek Encyclopedia depicts Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry as Robert April When Roddenberry submitted his first proposal for Star Trek to MGM Studios in 1964, his name for the starship commander was \\"Robert M. April\\" (another name, Captain James Winter, was also considered). The proposal was rejected, and Star Trek did not become a television reality until later that year when NBC accepted the premise, by which time the captain was changed to \\"Christopher Pike\\". Character history =\\"The Counter-Clock Incident\\"= Fred Bronson (writing as John Culver) created the character Commodore Robert April for his episode \\"The Counter-Clock Incident\\". Bronson came up with the idea of the Enterprise having a first Captain, a predecessor to Christopher Pike. He selected the name \\"Robert April\\" from the list of names from which Roddenberry selected the name of the Enterprise Captain, as published in the book The Making of Star Trek. In \\"The Counter-Clock Incident\\", the character's middle initial is T and not M as in Roddenberry's original proposal. In the episode, the Enterprise crew begins to rapidly age in reverse. The old age of Commodore April and his wife Sarah (voiced by Nichelle Nichols) affords them more time at maturity, allowing them to save the crew and undo the reverse aging process. The episode establishes that Sarah was the chief medical officer of the Enterprise during Robert April's time as the ship's commanding officer. =In print= Carey's books indicate that April comes from Coventry in England. He wears various cardigan sweaters over his uniform due to a rare blood disorder that causes him to feel slightly chilly most of the time. Commander George Kirk, father of future Enterprise commanding officer James T. Kirk, serves as April's executive officer. Carey's books also feature Sarah as the ship's chief medical officer. However, Crisis on Vulcan by Brad and Barbara Strickland portrays Pike as first officer under April when Spock visits the ship. =In comics= A unique version of April appeared in the final issues of Star Trek: Early Voyages where he appeared as a stubborn and extremely militaristic person, who ordered an attack against an unknown ship that was making provocative moves against the Enterprise, despite the fact that Number One was in command. The enemy counter-attacked, leaving Number One injured and April in command. The ending is unknown since the series ended on a cliffhanger. Another version of April appears in the new J. J. Abrams Star Trek continuity in a comic prologue to Star Trek Into Darkness, \\"Countdown to Darkness\\". =In computer games= Commodore Robert April is mentioned in the computer game Star Trek: Legacy during the early part of the TOS campaign, where he is still in Starfleet service in 2270. In the series, it would be between seasons 4 and 5, though the Commodore is only mentioned in the missions. =Star Trek: Discovery= In the fifth episode of Star Trek: Discovery, \\"Choose Your Pain\\", he is included in an alphabetical list from the Starfleet Database as one of Starfleet's most decorated Captains as of 2256. Also included in the list are: Jonathan Archer, Matthew Decker, Philippa Georgiou, and Christopher Pike. Other references to Robert April by Gene Roddenberry In the late 1950s, Gene Roddenberry wrote two episodes of Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel featuring a prison chaplain named Robert April. In the first episode, ‚ÄúThe Hanging of Roy Carter‚Äù, John Larch portrayed April, who faced the question of whether to intervene to delay an unjust hanging. During the second episode, ‚ÄúThe Return of Roy Carter‚Äù, April is portrayed by Larry J. Blake, and Paladin (Richard Boone) refers to April as being one of the finest men he has ever known. The episode ends with April dying while saving the life of a criminal trying to escape justice.

A corporation sole is one of two types of corporation, the other being a corporation aggregate. Ecclesiastical origins Most corporations sole are church related (for example, the Archbishopric of Canterbury),Terms and Conditions of churchofengland.org although some political offices of the United Kingdom (e.g., many of the Secretaries of State), Canada, and the United States are corporations sole. The concept of corporation sole originated as a means for orderly transfer of ecclesiastical property, serving to keep the title within the denomination or religious society. In order to keep the religious property from being treated as the estate of the vicar of the church, the property was titled to the office of the corporation sole. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, ecclesiastical property is usually titled to the diocesan bishop, who serves in the office of the corporation sole. The Roman Catholic Church continues to use corporations sole in holding titles of property: as recently as 2002, it split a diocese in the US state of California into many smaller corporations sole and with each parish priest becoming his own corporation sole, thus limiting the diocese's liability for any sexual abuse or other wrongful activity in which the priest might engage. This is, however, not the case everywhere, and legal application varies. For instance, other U.S. jurisdictions have used corporations at multiple levels. In the jurisdictions of England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland, a Roman Catholic bishop is not a corporation sole, and real property is held by way of land trusts, a tradition dating back to the suppression of Roman Catholicism by Henry VIII during the English Reformation and the Penal Laws of Ireland. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses the corporation sole form for its president, which is legally listed as \\"The Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\".Legal Names of Separately Incorporated Charities Affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‚Äêday Saints Iglesia ni Cristo was registered as corporation sole with the Insular Government of the Philippines in 1914 and with the People's Republic of China in 2014. The corporation sole form can serve the needs of a religious organization by reducing its complexity to that of a single office and its holder, thereby eliminating the need for by-laws and a board of directors. The Crown Within most constitutional monarchies, notably the Commonwealth realms, the Crown is a nonstatutory corporation sole. Although conceptually speaking, the office and officeholder retain dual capacities in that they may act both in a corporate capacity (as monarch) and in an individual capacity (as a private person), they are inseparably fused in law; there is no legal distinction between the office and the individual person who holds it. The Crown (state) legally acts as a person when it enters into contracts and possesses property. As a person, the monarch (officeholder) may hold properties privately, distinct from property he or she possesses corporately, and may act as monarch separate from their personal acts. For example, Elizabeth II as a natural person holds several separate offices, such as Queen of the United Kingdom, Queen of Canada, Queen of Australia, and Supreme Governor of the Church of England, all of which are distinct corporations sole, even as she acts as a natural person in her private capacities separate and apart from her role filling these various offices (corporations). Likewise, the office of prime minister has use of certain properties and privileges, such as an official residence and decision-making powers, that remain with the office once the officeholder leaves, even as the officeholder may own property in a private capacity. The sovereign's status as a corporation sole ensures that all references to the Queen, the King, Her Majesty, His Majesty, and the Crown are synonymous, referring to exactly the same legal personality over time.Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c I-21, as it appeared on 2020‚Äë03‚Äë05, ¬ß 35. While natural persons who serve as sovereign pass on, the sovereign never legally dies; thus the corporate nature of the office of sovereign ensures that the authority of the state continues uninterrupted. In other words, the sovereign is made a corporation sole to prevent the possibility of disruption or interregnum, thereby preserving the stability of the Crown (state). For this reason, at the moment of the demise of the sovereign, a successor is immediately and automatically in place.Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21, as it appeared on 2020‚Äë03‚Äë05, ¬ß 46. As a corporation sole, the legal person of the sovereign is the personification of the state and consequently acts as guarantor of the rule of law and the fount of all executive authority behind the state's institutions.McAteer et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2013 ONSC 5895 (CanLII), Morgan J. As certain countries have federal systems of government, the sovereign in these cases also possesses capacities as distinct corporation sole in right of each of the Australian states and Canadian provinces; for example, as Her Majesty the Queen of Australia in Right of Queensland and Her Majesty the Queen of Canada in Right of Alberta. Secular application in the United States Every state of the United States recognizes corporations sole under common law, and about a third of the states have specific statutes that stipulate the conditions under which that state recognizes the corporations sole that are filed with that state for acquiring, holding, and disposing of title for church and religious society property. Almost any religious society or church can qualify for filing as a corporation sole in these states. There can be no legal limitation to specific denominations, therefore a Buddhist temple or Jewish Community Center would qualify as quickly as a Christian church. Some states also recognize corporations sole for various other non- profit purposes including performing arts groups, scientific research groups, educational institutions, and cemetery societies.

Both steaks include a \\"T\\"-shaped lumbar vertebra with sections of abdominal internal oblique muscle on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon (called fillet steak in Commonwealth countries and Ireland), especially if cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin. There is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The United States Department of Agriculture's Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least wide at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least wide. However, steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \\"T-bone\\" in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse. Owing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin. In the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173. In British usage, followed in the Commonwealth countries, \\"porterhouse\\" often means a British sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone.Great Berwick Organics: Porterhouse Steak Linked 2017-05-16 However, nowadays some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.Farmison & Co: Porterhouse Steak Linked 2017-05-16 In New Zealand and Australia, a Porterhouse is sirloin steak (strip steak in USA) off the bone. \\"Porterhouse\\" etymology Porterhouse steak The origin of the term \\"porterhouse\\" is contentious, with several cities and establishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in his Pearl Street (Manhattan) \\"Porter House\\" around 1814, while noting the lack of contemporary evidence to support the tale.OED Online says \\"frequently supposed to derive its name from a well-known porterhouse in New York in the early 19th Century, although there is apparently no contemporary evidence to support this\\" This origin story gained traction in the late 19th century. Some sources contend a Cambridge, Massachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent his name to the cut of beef. In that era (late 18th to early 20th century), Porter Square was flanked by cattle yards that used the Porter rail head to transport their beef throughout the US. Still others claim the steak takes its name from various other 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter House, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.e.g. Zachariah B. Porter of the defunct Porter House hotel in Porter Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts ; Martin Morrison of a New York City porter- house proprietor, ; the Porter House Hotel of Flowery Branch, Georgia ; Anatomy of the T-bone To cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen. Preparation Florentine steak in Florence, Italy T-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. There is some contention as to whether the bone conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking,Delia Smith:Lamb LBC:Cooking in the credit crunch or the meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip. =Bistecca alla fiorentina= Bistecca alla fiorentina, or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, \\"Bistecca\\" are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.Waverly Root, The Food of Italy, 1971, . =Cotoletta di Vitello alla Milanese= The same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for Cotoletta alla milanese, which consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.

Earldoms named after Rutland have been created three times; the ninth earl of the third creation was made duke in 1703, in whose family's line the title continues. The heir apparent to the dukedom has the privilege of using the courtesy style/title of the Marquis/Marquess of Granby. Earldom of Rutland =First creation= The title Earl of Rutland was created on 25 February 1390 for Edward of Norwich (1373‚Äì1415), son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and grandson of King Edward III. Upon the Duke's death in 1402 Edward became Duke of York. The title Earl of Rutland fell into disuse upon his death at the Battle of Agincourt, and was assumed by other members of the House of York including the first earl's nephew Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, the father of King Edward IV. =Second creation= The title Earl of Rutland was created on 29 January 1446 for Edmund (1443‚Äì1460), second son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York (and younger brother of the future King Edward IV). =Third creation= Thomas Manners (c. 1488‚Äì1543), son of the 11th Baron de Ros of Hamlake, Truibut and Belvoir, was created Earl of Rutland in the Peerage of England in 1525. He was the great-grandson of Richard Plantagenet. The barony of 'de Ros of Hamlake, Truibut and Belvoir' (sometimes spelled Ros, Roos or de Roos) was created by Simon de Montfort with a writ of summons to the House of Lords for Robert de Ros (1223‚Äì1285) in 1264. The title may pass through the female line when there is no male heir, and accordingly, when the 3rd Earl, Edward Manners (c. 1548‚Äì1587), left no sons, the barony of Ros passed to the family of his daughter Elizabeth (died 1591) who became the wife of the 2nd Earl of Exeter. The 3rd Earl was succeeded as 4th Earl by his brother John (died 1588). The barony of Ros was restored to the Manners family when Francis Manners, the 6th Earl (1578‚Äì1632), inherited it in 1618 from his cousin William Cecil (1590‚Äì1618). However, Francis died without male issue and the assumption of the courtesy title of Lord Ros for the eldest son of subsequent earls appears to have had no legal basis. On the death of the seventh Earl in 1641 the Earldom passed to his distant cousin John Manners of Haddon Hall, grandson of the second son of the first Earl. Dukedom of Rutland In 1703, the ninth Earl of Rutland was created Duke of Rutland and Marquess of Granby by Queen Anne. =Marquess of Granby= The most notable Marquess of Granby was John Manners (1721‚Äì1770), eldest son of the third Duke. He was an accomplished soldier and highly popular figure of his time; in 1745 he became a colonel; his military career flourished during the Seven Years' War. At the Battle of Minden (8 August 1759), although his role was small, he commanded the reserve cavalry. In 1760, at the Battle of Warburg, he led a cavalry charge which routed the French, losing his hat and wig in the process. In recognition of this, soldiers of the Blues and Royals (his former regiment) have the unique privilege in the British Army of being permitted to salute while not wearing headgear. Granby's losing his helmet and wig in the charge gave rise to the expression 'going bald-headed' at something. In 1758, the King made him Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards and in 1766, as Lieutenant- General, he became Commander-in-Chief (a basically political appointment). His title was honoured by being used by a large number of pubs throughout Britain, although the reason is little known. As Colonel, he provided for his most capable soldiers such that when they could no longer be of service to the Regiment, he would \\"grub-stake\\" them to start a pub, the sole condition being that the Pub was to be named \\"The Marquis of Granby\\" after him. The towns of Granby, Quebec in Canada and Granby, Massachusetts and Granby, Connecticut in the United States as well as Granby Street in Norfolk, Virginia, USA were also named after him. He died before his father, and therefore did not become Duke. =Subsidiary titles= The subsidiary titles of the dukedom are: Marquess of Granby (created 1703), Earl of Rutland (1525), Baron Manners, of Haddon in the County of Derby (1679), and Baron Roos of Belvoir, of Belvoir in the County of Leicester (1896). The title Baron Roos of Belvoir is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; the remaining titles being in the Peerage of England. The most senior subsidiary title, Marquess of Granby, is the courtesy title used by the Duke's eldest son and heir. =Family seat= Haddon Hall, Nether Haddon, Derbyshire The Manners family own medieval Haddon Hall, Derbyshire and Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire that were successively extended and rebuilt until the 19th century. Some rooms in both buildings are open to the public.Haddon Hall ‚Äì Grade I ‚Äì They are Grade I in architecture, set in listed parks, woodland and gardens and span a central water feature, which acted as models for other landscaped estates.Belvoir Castle ‚Äì Grade I ‚Äì In 2009, to mark 500 years of the occupancy of Belvoir Castle by the family two aircraft from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, bore the Duke of Rutland's Coat of Arms.

Since elevation to the dukedom in 1703 most Dukes have been buried in the grounds of the mausoleum at Belvoir Castle. The mausoleum at Belvoir Castle was built by John Henry Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, following the death of his wife, Elizabeth Howard (1780‚Äì1825), daughter of the 5th Earl of Carlisle. After its construction, most of the 18th century monuments in Belton Church were moved to the mausoleum which then became the family's main place of burial. =Literature= Jorge Luis Borges recalls the duke of Rutland in his story \\"A Survey of the Works of Herbet Quain\\" in the book The Garden of Forking Paths.

In computer science, the clique problem is the computational problem of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other, also called complete subgraphs) in a graph. It has several different formulations depending on which cliques, and what information about the cliques, should be found. Common formulations of the clique problem include finding a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size. The clique problem arises in the following real- world setting. Consider a social network, where the graph's vertices represent people, and the graph's edges represent mutual acquaintance. Then a clique represents a subset of people who all know each other, and algorithms for finding cliques can be used to discover these groups of mutual friends. Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics, and computational chemistry. Most versions of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation. To find a maximum clique, one can systematically inspect all subsets, but this sort of brute- force search is too time-consuming to be practical for networks comprising more than a few dozen vertices. Although no polynomial time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the Bron‚ÄìKerbosch algorithm can be used to list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and it is also possible to list them in polynomial time per clique. History and applications The study of complete subgraphs in mathematics predates the \\"clique\\" terminology. For instance, complete subgraphs make an early appearance in the mathematical literature in the graph-theoretic reformulation of Ramsey theory by . But the term \\"clique\\" and the problem of algorithmically listing cliques both come from the social sciences, where complete subgraphs are used to model social cliques, groups of people who all know each other. used graphs to model social networks, and adapted the social science terminology to graph theory. They were the first to call complete subgraphs \\"cliques\\". The first algorithm for solving the clique problem is that of ,; . who were motivated by the sociological application. Social science researchers have also defined various other types of cliques and maximal cliques in social network, \\"cohesive subgroups\\" of people or actors in the network all of whom share one of several different kinds of connectivity relation. Many of these generalized notions of cliques can also be found by constructing an undirected graph whose edges represent related pairs of actors from the social network, and then applying an algorithm for the clique problem to this graph. Since the work of Harary and Ross, many others have devised algorithms for various versions of the clique problem. In the 1970s, researchers began studying these algorithms from the point of view of worst-case analysis. See, for instance, , an early work on the worst-case complexity of the maximum clique problem. Also in the 1970s, beginning with the work of and , researchers began using the theory of NP- completeness and related intractability results to provide a mathematical explanation for the perceived difficulty of the clique problem. In the 1990s, a breakthrough series of papers beginning with and reported in The New York Times, showed that (assuming P ‚â† NP) it is not even possible to approximate the problem accurately and efficiently. Clique-finding algorithms have been used in chemistry, to find chemicals that match a target structure and to model molecular docking and the binding sites of chemical reactions. They can also be used to find similar structures within different molecules.. See in particular pp. 35‚Äì36. In these applications, one forms a graph in which each vertex represents a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms in which all the matches are compatible with each other.. See in particular pp. 6‚Äì7. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product. In automatic test pattern generation, finding cliques can help to bound the size of a test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.The Keller graph used by has 1048576 vertices and clique size 1024. They described a synthetic construction for the clique, but also used clique-finding algorithms on smaller graphs to help guide their search. simplified the proof by finding a clique of size 256 in a 65536-vertex Keller graph. Definitions The graph shown has one maximum clique, the triangle {1,2,5}, and four more maximal cliques, the pairs {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}. An undirected graph is formed by a finite set of vertices and a set of unordered pairs of vertices, which are called edges. By convention, in algorithm analysis, the number of vertices in the graph is denoted by and the number of edges is denoted by . A clique in a graph is a complete subgraph of . That is, it is a subset of the vertices such that every two vertices in are the two endpoints of an edge in . A maximal clique is a clique to which no more vertices can be added. For each vertex that is not part of a maximal clique, there must be another vertex that is in the clique and non-adjacent to , preventing from being added to the clique. A maximum clique is a clique that includes the largest possible number of vertices. The clique number is the number of vertices in a maximum clique of . Several closely related clique-finding problems have been studied.; . *In the maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a maximum clique in the graph. If there are multiple maximum cliques, one of them may be chosen arbitrarily. *In the weighted maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique problem is the special case in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied. *In the maximal clique listing problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a list of all its maximal cliques. The maximum clique problem may be solved using as a subroutine an algorithm for the maximal clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the maximal cliques. *In the -clique problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number . The output is a clique with vertices, if one exists, or a special value indicating that there is no -clique otherwise. In some variations of this problem, the output should list all cliques of size . *In the clique decision problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number , and the output is a Boolean value: true if the graph contains a -clique, and false otherwise. The first four of these problems are all important in practical applications. The clique decision problem is not of practical importance; it is formulated in this way in order to apply the theory of NP-completeness to clique-finding problems. The clique problem and the independent set problem are complementary: a clique in is an independent set in the complement graph of and vice versa., Exercise 34-1, p. 1018. Therefore, many computational results may be applied equally well to either problem, and some research papers do not clearly distinguish between the two problems. However, the two problems have different properties when applied to restricted families of graphs. For instance, the clique problem may be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs; . while the independent set problem remains NP-hard on planar graphs. Algorithms =Finding a single maximal clique= A maximal clique, sometimes called inclusion-maximal, is a clique that is not included in a larger clique. Therefore, every clique is contained in a maximal clique.See, e.g., . Maximal cliques can be very small. A graph may contain a non-maximal clique with many vertices and a separate clique of size 2 which is maximal. While a maximum (i.e., largest) clique is necessarily maximal, the converse does not hold. There are some types of graphs in which every maximal clique is maximum; these are the complements of the well-covered graphs, in which every maximal independent set is maximum. However, other graphs have maximal cliques that are not maximum. A single maximal clique can be found by a straightforward greedy algorithm. Starting with an arbitrary clique (for instance, any single vertex or even the empty set), grow the current clique one vertex at a time by looping through the graph's remaining vertices. For each vertex that this loop examines, add to the clique if it is adjacent to every vertex that is already in the clique, and discard otherwise. This algorithm runs in linear time., p. 526. Because of the ease of finding maximal cliques, and their potential small size, more attention has been given to the much harder algorithmic problem of finding a maximum or otherwise large clique than has been given to the problem of finding a single maximal clique. However, some research in parallel algorithms has studied the problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) has been shown to be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem is unlikely to be solvable within the parallel complexity class NC. =Cliques of fixed size= One can test whether a graph contains a -vertex clique, and find any such clique that it contains, using a brute force algorithm. This algorithm examines each subgraph with vertices and checks to see whether it forms a clique. It takes time , as expressed using big O notation. This is because there are subgraphs to check, each of which has edges whose presence in needs to be checked. Thus, the problem may be solved in polynomial time whenever is a fixed constant. However, when does not have a fixed value, but instead may vary as part of the input to the problem, the time is exponential.E.g., see . The simplest nontrivial case of the clique-finding problem is finding a triangle in a graph, or equivalently determining whether the graph is triangle-free. In a graph with edges, there may be at most triangles (using big theta notation to indicate that this bound is tight). The worst case for this formula occurs when is itself a clique. Therefore, algorithms for listing all triangles must take at least time in the worst case (using big omega notation), and algorithms are known that match this time bound. provide an algorithm with running time that finds a triangle if one exists but does not list all triangles; list all triangles in time . For instance, describe an algorithm that sorts the vertices in order from highest degree to lowest and then iterates through each vertex in the sorted list, looking for triangles that include and do not include any previous vertex in the list. To do so the algorithm marks all neighbors of , searches through all edges incident to a neighbor of outputting a triangle for every edge that has two marked endpoints, and then removes the marks and deletes from the graph. As the authors show, the time for this algorithm is proportional to the arboricity of the graph (denoted ) multiplied by the number of edges, which is . Since the arboricity is at most , this algorithm runs in time . More generally, all -vertex cliques can be listed by a similar algorithm that takes time proportional to the number of edges multiplied by the arboricity to the power . For graphs of constant arboricity, such as planar graphs (or in general graphs from any non-trivial minor-closed graph family), this algorithm takes time, which is optimal since it is linear in the size of the input.. If one desires only a single triangle, or an assurance that the graph is triangle- free, faster algorithms are possible. As observe, the graph contains a triangle if and only if its adjacency matrix and the square of the adjacency matrix contain nonzero entries in the same cell. Therefore, fast matrix multiplication techniques such as the Coppersmith‚ÄìWinograd algorithm can be applied to find triangles in time . used fast matrix multiplication to improve the algorithm for finding triangles to . These algorithms based on fast matrix multiplication have also been extended to problems of finding -cliques for larger values of .; ; ; ; . =Listing all maximal cliques= By a result of , every -vertex graph has at most maximal cliques. They can be listed by the Bron‚ÄìKerbosch algorithm, a recursive backtracking procedure of . The main recursive subroutine of this procedure has three arguments: a partially constructed (non-maximal) clique, a set of candidate vertices that could be added to the clique, and another set of vertices that should not be added (because doing so would lead to a clique that has already been found). The algorithm tries adding the candidate vertices one by one to the partial clique, making a recursive call for each one. After trying each of these vertices, it moves it to the set of vertices that should not be added again. Variants of this algorithm can be shown to have worst-case running time , matching the number of cliques that might need to be listed. Therefore, this provides a worst-case-optimal solution to the problem of listing all maximal cliques. Further, the Bron‚ÄìKerbosch algorithm has been widely reported as being faster in practice than its alternatives.; . However, when the number of cliques is significantly smaller than its worst case, other algorithms might be preferable. As showed, it is also possible to list all maximal cliques in a graph in an amount of time that is polynomial per generated clique. An algorithm such as theirs in which the running time depends on the output size is known as an output-sensitive algorithm. Their algorithm is based on the following two observations, relating the maximal cliques of the given graph to the maximal cliques of a graph formed by removing an arbitrary vertex from : *For every maximal clique of , either continues to form a maximal clique in , or forms a maximal clique in . Therefore, has at least as many maximal cliques as does. *Each maximal clique in that does not contain is a maximal clique in , and each maximal clique in that does contain can be formed from a maximal clique in by adding and removing the non-neighbors of from . Using these observations they can generate all maximal cliques in by a recursive algorithm that chooses a vertex arbitrarily and then, for each maximal clique in , outputs both and the clique formed by adding to and removing the non-neighbors of . However, some cliques of may be generated in this way from more than one parent clique of , so they eliminate duplicates by outputting a clique in only when its parent in is lexicographically maximum among all possible parent cliques. On the basis of this principle, they show that all maximal cliques in may be generated in time per clique, where is the number of edges in and is the number of vertices. improve this to per clique, where is the arboricity of the given graph. provide an alternative output-sensitive algorithm based on fast matrix multiplication. show that it is even possible to list all maximal cliques in lexicographic order with polynomial delay per clique. However, the choice of ordering is important for the efficiency of this algorithm: for the reverse of this order, there is no polynomial-delay algorithm unless P = NP. On the basis of this result, it is possible to list all maximal cliques in polynomial time, for families of graphs in which the number of cliques is polynomially bounded. These families include chordal graphs, complete graphs, triangle-free graphs, interval graphs, graphs of bounded boxicity, and planar graphs. In particular, the planar graphs have cliques, of at most constant size, that can be listed in linear time. The same is true for any family of graphs that is both sparse (having a number of edges at most a constant times the number of vertices) and closed under the operation of taking subgraphs. =Finding maximum cliques in arbitrary graphs= It is possible to find the maximum clique, or the clique number, of an arbitrary n-vertex graph in time by using one of the algorithms described above to list all maximal cliques in the graph and returning the largest one. However, for this variant of the clique problem better worst-case time bounds are possible. The algorithm of solves this problem in time . It is a recursive backtracking scheme similar to that of the Bron‚ÄìKerbosch algorithm, but is able to eliminate some recursive calls when it can be shown that the cliques found within the call will be suboptimal. improved the time to , and improved it to time, at the expense of greater space usage. Robson's algorithm combines a similar backtracking scheme (with a more complicated case analysis) and a dynamic programming technique in which the optimal solution is precomputed for all small connected subgraphs of the complement graph. These partial solutions are used to shortcut the backtracking recursion. The fastest algorithm known today is a refined version of this method by which runs in time . There has also been extensive research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound,; ; ; ; ; ; ; . local search,; . greedy algorithms,; . and constraint programming. Non- standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing. Although the title refers to maximal cliques, the problem this paper solves is actually the maximum clique problem. and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem was the subject of an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992‚Äì1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge, which is publicly available.DIMACS challenge graphs for the clique problem , accessed 2009-12-17. =Special classes of graphs= In this permutation graph, the maximum cliques correspond to the longest decreasing subsequences (4,3,1) and (4,3,2) of the defining permutation. Planar graphs, and other families of sparse graphs, have been discussed above: they have linearly many maximal cliques, of bounded size, that can be listed in linear time. In particular, for planar graphs, any clique can have at most four vertices, by Kuratowski's theorem. Perfect graphs are defined by the properties that their clique number equals their chromatic number, and that this equality holds also in each of their induced subgraphs. For perfect graphs, it is possible to find a maximum clique in polynomial time, using an algorithm based on semidefinite programming. However, this method is complex and non-combinatorial, and specialized clique-finding algorithms have been developed for many subclasses of perfect graphs. In the complement graphs of bipartite graphs, K≈ënig's theorem allows the maximum clique problem to be solved using techniques for matching. In another class of perfect graphs, the permutation graphs, a maximum clique is a longest decreasing subsequence of the permutation defining the graph and can be found using known algorithms for the longest decreasing subsequence problem. Conversely, every instance of the longest decreasing subsequence problem can be described equivalently as a problem of finding a maximum clique in a permutation graph., p. 159. provide an alternative quadratic-time algorithm for maximum cliques in comparability graphs, a broader class of perfect graphs that includes the permutation graphs as a special case. In chordal graphs, the maximal cliques can be found by listing the vertices in an elimination ordering, and checking the clique neighborhoods of each vertex in this ordering., Lemma 4.5, p. 19. In some cases, these algorithms can be extended to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood.; , p. 247. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices. The algorithmic problem of finding a maximum clique in a random graph drawn from the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model (in which each edge appears with probability , independently from the other edges) was suggested by . Because the maximum clique in a random graph has logarithmic size with high probability, it can be found by a brute force search in expected time . This is a quasi-polynomial time bound. Although the clique number of such graphs is usually very close to , simple greedy algorithms as well as more sophisticated randomized approximation techniques only find cliques with size , half as big. The number of maximal cliques in such graphs is with high probability exponential in , which prevents methods that list all maximal cliques from running in polynomial time. Because of the difficulty of this problem, several authors have investigated the planted clique problem, the clique problem on random graphs that have been augmented by adding large cliques., Example 18.2, pp. 362‚Äì363. While spectral methods and semidefinite programming can detect hidden cliques of size , no polynomial-time algorithms are currently known to detect those of size (expressed using little-o notation). =Approximation algorithms= Several authors have considered approximation algorithms that attempt to find a clique or independent set that, although not maximum, has size as close to the maximum as can be found in polynomial time. Although much of this work has focused on independent sets in sparse graphs, a case that does not make sense for the complementary clique problem, there has also been work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.; ; . describes a polynomial time algorithm that finds a clique of size in any graph that has clique number for any constant . By using this algorithm when the clique number of a given input graph is between and , switching to a different algorithm of for graphs with higher clique numbers, and choosing a two-vertex clique if both algorithms fail to find anything, Feige provides an approximation algorithm that finds a clique with a number of vertices within a factor of of the maximum. Although the approximation ratio of this algorithm is weak, it is the best known to date.: \\"In terms of the number of vertices in graphs, Feige shows the currently known best approximation ratio\\". Liu et al. are writing about the maximum independent set but for purposes of approximation there is no difference between the two problems. The results on hardness of approximation described below suggest that there can be no approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio significantly less than linear. Lower bounds =NP-completeness= The 3-CNF Satisfiability instance (x ‚à® x ‚à® y) ‚àß (~x ‚à® ~y ‚à® ~y) ‚àß (~x ‚à® y ‚à® y) reduced to Clique. The green vertices form a 3-clique and correspond to a satisfying assignment.Adapted from The clique decision problem is NP-complete. It was one of Richard Karp's original 21 problems shown NP-complete in his 1972 paper \\"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\\". This problem was also mentioned in Stephen Cook's paper introducing the theory of NP-complete problems. Because of the hardness of the decision problem, the problem of finding a maximum clique is also NP-hard. If one could solve it, one could also solve the decision problem, by comparing the size of the maximum clique to the size parameter given as input in the decision problem. Karp's NP-completeness proof is a many-one reduction from the Boolean satisfiability problem. It describes how to translate Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) into equivalent instances of the maximum clique problem. gives essentially the same reduction, from 3-SAT instead of Satisfiability, to show that subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete. Satisfiability, in turn, was proved NP-complete in the Cook‚ÄìLevin theorem. From a given CNF formula, Karp forms a graph that has a vertex for every pair , where is a variable or its negation and is a clause in the formula that contains . Two of these vertices are connected by an edge if they represent compatible variable assignments for different clauses. That is, there is an edge from to whenever and and are not each other's negations. If denotes the number of clauses in the CNF formula, then the -vertex cliques in this graph represent consistent ways of assigning truth values to some of its variables in order to satisfy the formula. Therefore, the formula is satisfiable if and only if a -vertex clique exists. Some NP-complete problems (such as the travelling salesman problem in planar graphs) may be solved in time that is exponential in a sublinear function of the input size parameter , significantly faster than a brute-force search.. However, it is unlikely that such a subexponential time bound is possible for the clique problem in arbitrary graphs, as it would imply similarly subexponential bounds for many other standard NP-complete problems. =Circuit complexity= A monotone circuit to detect a -clique in an -vertex graph for and . Each input to the circuit encodes the presence or absence of a particular (red) edge in the graph. The circuit uses one internal and-gate to detect each potential -clique. The computational difficulty of the clique problem has led it to be used to prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super- polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices.. For earlier and weaker bounds on monotone circuits for the clique problem, see and . Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial.. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size. used communication complexity to prove this result. =Decision tree complexity= A simple decision tree to detect the presence of a 3-clique in a 4-vertex graph. It uses up to 6 questions of the form \\"Does the red edge exist?\\", matching the optimal bound n(n ‚àí 1)/2. The (deterministic) decision tree complexity of determining a graph property is the number of questions of the form \\"Is there an edge between vertex and vertex ?\\" that have to be answered in the worst case to determine whether a graph has a particular property. That is, it is the minimum height of a boolean decision tree for the problem. There are possible questions to be asked. Therefore, any graph property can be determined with at most questions. It is also possible to define random and quantum decision tree complexity of a property, the expected number of questions (for a worst case input) that a randomized or quantum algorithm needs to have answered in order to correctly determine whether the given graph has the property.See , Chapter 12, \\"Decision trees\\", pp. 259‚Äì269. Because the property of containing a clique is monotone, it is covered by the Aanderaa‚ÄìKarp‚ÄìRosenberg conjecture, which states that the deterministic decision tree complexity of determining any non-trivial monotone graph property is exactly . For arbitrary monotone graph properties, this conjecture remains unproven. However, for deterministic decision trees, and for any in the range , the property of containing a -clique was shown to have decision tree complexity exactly by . Deterministic decision trees also require exponential size to detect cliques, or large polynomial size to detect cliques of bounded size.. The Aanderaa‚ÄìKarp‚ÄìRosenberg conjecture also states that the randomized decision tree complexity of non-trivial monotone functions is . The conjecture again remains unproven, but has been resolved for the property of containing a clique for . This property is known to have randomized decision tree complexity .For instance, this follows from . For quantum decision trees, the best known lower bound is , but no matching algorithm is known for the case of .; . =Fixed-parameter intractability= Parameterized complexity is the complexity-theoretic study of problems that are naturally equipped with a small integer parameter and for which the problem becomes more difficult as increases, such as finding -cliques in graphs. A problem is said to be fixed- parameter tractable if there is an algorithm for solving it on inputs of size , and a function , such that the algorithm runs in time . That is, it is fixed-parameter tractable if it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed value of and moreover if the exponent of the polynomial does not depend on .. Technically, there is usually an additional requirement that be a computable function. For finding -vertex cliques, the brute force search algorithm has running time . Because the exponent of depends on , this algorithm is not fixed-parameter tractable. Although it can be improved by fast matrix multiplication the running time still has an exponent that is linear in Thus, although the running time of known algorithms for the clique problem is polynomial for any fixed , these algorithms do not suffice for fixed-parameter tractability. defined a hierarchy of parametrized problems, the W hierarchy, that they conjectured did not have fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. They proved that independent set (or, equivalently, clique) is hard for the first level of this hierarchy, W[1]. Thus, according to their conjecture, clique has no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. Moreover, this result provides the basis for proofs of W[1]-hardness of many other problems, and thus serves as an analogue of the Cook‚ÄìLevin theorem for parameterized complexity. showed that finding -vertex cliques cannot be done in time unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. Again, this provides evidence that no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is possible. Although the problems of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques are unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter , they may be fixed-parameter tractable for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems are known to be fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the degeneracy of the input graph.. =Hardness of approximation= A graph of compatibility relations among 2-bit samples of 3-bit proof strings. Each maximal clique (triangle) in this graph represents all ways of sampling a single 3-bit string. The proof of inapproximability of the clique problem involves induced subgraphs of analogously defined graphs for larger numbers of bits. Weak results hinting that the clique problem might be hard to approximate have been known for a long time. observed that, because of the fact that the clique number takes on small integer values and is NP-hard to compute, it cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began to make connections between the approximation of maximum cliques and probabilistically checkable proofs. They used these connections to prove hardness of approximation results for the maximum clique problem.; ; ; . After many improvements to these results it is now known that, for every real number , there can be no polynomial time algorithm that approximates the maximum clique to within a factor better than , unless P = NP. showed inapproximability for this ratio using a stronger complexity theoretic assumption, the inequality of NP and ZPP. described more precisely the inapproximability ratio, but with an even stronger assumption. derandomized the construction weakening its assumption to P ‚â† NP. The rough idea of these inapproximability results is to form a graph that represents a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof if and only if it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial- time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low. To transform a probabilistically checkable proof system of this type into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined by one of the possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. It can be represented by a partial word with a 0 or 1 at each examined position and a wildcard character at each remaining position. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has only a small number of checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P = NP.This reduction is originally due to and used in all subsequent inapproximability proofs; the proofs differ in the strengths and details of the probabilistically checkable proof systems that they rely on.

NP-complete problems Computational problems in graph theory fr:Clique (th√©orie des graphes)#Probl√®me de la clique ","title":"Clique problem"},{"id":"249266","text":"Waitangi Day (), the national day of New Zealand, marks the anniversary of the initial signing ‚Äì on 6 February 1840 ‚Äì of the Treaty of Waitangi, which is regarded as the founding document of the nation. The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974. In present-day New Zealand, the anniversary is observed annually on 6 February and the day is usually recognised as a public holiday (unless the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, when the Monday that immediately follows becomes the public holiday). Ceremonies take place at Waitangi and elsewhere to commemorate the signing of the treaty. A variety of events are staged, including parties, MƒÅori hui (social gatherings), reflections on New Zealand history, official awards and citizenship ceremonies. The commemoration has also been the focus of protest by MƒÅori activists, and is often marred by controversy. History Treaty House and grounds at Waitangi, where the treaty was first signed. The first Waitangi Day was celebrated in the grounds on 6 February 1934. The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed on 6 February 1840 on the grounds of James Busby's house‚Äînow known as Treaty House‚Äîat Waitangi, in the Bay of Islands. The treaty was signed by representatives acting on behalf of the British Crown and, initially, about 45 MƒÅori chiefs. Over the course of the next seven months, copies of the treaty were toured around the country to give other chiefs the opportunity to sign. The signing had the effect of securing British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand, which was officially proclaimed on 21 May 1840. =Previous celebrations= Prior to 1934, most celebrations of New Zealand's founding as a colony were held on 29 January, the date on which William Hobson arrived in the Bay of Islands to issue the proclamation of his appointment, which had been prepared by colonial office officials in England. Hobson had no draft treaty. From the British perspective the proclamation was the key legal document, \\"what the treaty said was less important\\".Before Hobson.pp 159‚Äì260 T. Simpson. Blythswood Press.2015. In 1932, Governor-General Lord Bledisloe and his wife purchased and presented to the nation the run-down house of James Busby, where the treaty was initially signed. They subsequently donated to restore the building. The Treaty House and grounds were made a public reserve, which was dedicated on 6 February 1934. This event is considered to be the first Waitangi Day. In 1940, another event was held at the grounds, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing. The event was a success and helped raise the profile of the treaty and its day of observance in the national consciousness. =Annual commemorations= Annual commemorations of the treaty signing began in 1947. The 1947 event was a Royal New Zealand Navy ceremony centring on a flagpole which the Navy had paid to erect in the grounds. The ceremony was brief and featured no MƒÅori. The following year, a MƒÅori speaker was added to the line-up, and subsequent additions to the ceremony were made nearly every year. From 1952, the governor-general attended, and from 1958 the prime minister also attended, although not every year. From the mid-1950s, a MƒÅori cultural performance was usually given as part of the ceremony. Many of these early features remain a part of Waitangi Day ceremonies, including a naval salute, the MƒÅori cultural performance (now usually a p≈çwhiri, a ceremonial welcome), and speeches from a range of MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ dignitaries. =Proposed as public holiday= The Labour Party stated in its 1957 election manifesto that it would make Waitangi Day a public holiday. After winning that year's election, the party said that the country could not afford another public holiday. The Waitangi Day Act of 1960 allowed localities to transfer the holiday from their existing regional public holiday to Waitangi Day. In 1963, after a change of government, the passing of the Waitangi Day Amendment Act transferred the holiday observed in Northland on Auckland Anniversary Day (the Monday closest to 29 January) to Waitangi Day, 6 February. This made Waitangi Day a holiday in Northland only. =Transition to public holiday= Norman Kirk and a MƒÅori boy on Waitangi Day, 1973 Waitangi Day became a nationwide public holiday on its observance in 1974 by first undergoing a name change. In 1971 the Labour shadow minister of MƒÅori Affairs, Matiu Rata, introduced a private member's bill to make Waitangi Day a national holiday, to be called New Zealand Day. This was not passed into law. After the 1972 election of the third Labour government under Prime Minister Norman Kirk, it was announced that from 1974, Waitangi Day would be a national holiday known as New Zealand Day. The New Zealand Day Act legislation was passed in 1973. For Kirk, the change was simply an acceptance that New Zealand was ready to move towards a broader concept of nationhood. Diplomatic posts had for some years marked the day, and it seemed timely in view of the country's increasing role on the international stage that the national day be known as New Zealand Day. At the 1974 commemorations, the Flag of New Zealand was flown for the first time at the top of the flagstaff at Waitangi, rather than the Union Flag, and a replica of the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand was also flown. The election of the third National government in 1975 led to the day being renamed Waitangi Day because the new prime minister, Robert Muldoon, did not like the name \\"New Zealand Day\\" and many MƒÅori felt that it debased the treaty. Another Waitangi Day Act was passed in 1976 to change the name back to Waitangi DayWaitangi Day at NZhistory.net.nz and restore Northland's anniversary day holiday to that of Auckland. Waitangi Day underwent 'Mondayisation' in legislation enacted in 2013, shifting the public holiday to Monday if 6 February falls on a Saturday or Sunday. Commemorations =At Waitangi= The challenge at Waitangi Day, 1976, with Prime Minister Robert Muldoon present Commemorations at Waitangi usually commence the previous day, 5 February, at the NgƒÅpuhi marae Te Tii, when political dignitaries are welcomed onto the marae and hear speeches from the local iwi. These speeches often deal with the issues of the day, and vigorous and robust debate occurs. Politicians are usually granted speaking rights, but on occasion, the privilege has been withdrawn, as with Leader of the Opposition Helen Clark in 1999, Prime Minister John Key in 2016 (when one faction indicated it would even block him from entering the marae), and Prime Minister Bill English in 2017. In 2018, Jacinda Ardern was the first Prime Minister to attend the ceremony in three years. At dawn on Waitangi Day, the Royal New Zealand Navy raises the New Zealand Flag, Union Flag and White Ensign on the flagstaff in the treaty grounds. The ceremonies during the day generally include a church service and cultural displays such as dance and song. Several waka and a navy ship also re-enact the coming ashore of Governor Hobson to sign the treaty. The day closes with the flags being lowered by the Navy in a traditional ceremony. =Elsewhere in New Zealand= Prime Minister Helen Clark being welcomed onto Hoani Waititi Marae, in West Auckland, Waitangi Day 2006 Some marae use the day as an open day and an educational experience for their local communities, giving them the opportunity to experience MƒÅori culture and protocol, or as an opportunity to explain where they see MƒÅori are and the way forward for MƒÅori in New Zealand. Commemorations are largely muted in comparison to those seen on the national days of most countries. There are no mass parades or firework displays, nor truly widespread commemorations. At Government House in Auckland, citizenship ceremonies are usually held. As the day is a public holiday, and coincides with the warmest part of the New Zealand summer, many people take the opportunity to spend the day at the beach ‚Äì an important part of New Zealand culture. Since 2014, the New Zealand Society of Authors awards the Waitangi Day Literary Honours on Waitangi Day. = In Australia = At the Kingston Butter Factory in Kingston, Queensland, Australia, the Te Korowai Aroha (Cloak of Love) Association held a multicultural festival to mark Waitangi Day annually from 2002. In Sydney, an estimated 8,000 people attended the 2013 Waitangi Day Festival at Holroyd Gardens, Merrylands, an annual event in its fifth year. The festival featured displays of artefacts, performance of the haka, MƒÅori cuisine and culture, tattooing and wood carving. 6 February 2015 saw the inaugural Waitangi Day Commemoration held at Nurragingy Reserve, where the focus is more on the document itself, the Treaty process and the significance to MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ today. It was co-hosted by the Blacktown City Council and the New South Wales MƒÅori Wardens. =In the United Kingdom= In London, England, which has one of the largest New Zealand expatriate populations, the occasion is commemorated by the Waitangi Day Ball, held by the New Zealand Society UK. The focus of the event is a commemoration of New Zealand's unity and diversity as a nation. The Ball also hosts the annual UK New Zealander of the Year awards, cultural entertainment from London-based MƒÅori group NgƒÅti RƒÅnana and fine wine and cuisine from New Zealand. A service is also held by the society at the church of St Lawrence Jewry. A tradition, observed for more than 30 years , takes place on the closest Saturday to 6 February: Kiwis participate in a pub crawl using the London Underground's Circle Line. = Elsewhere in the world = In many other countries with a New Zealand expatriate population, Waitangi Day is commemorated privately. The day is officially commemorated by all New Zealand embassies and high commissions. For Waitangi Day 2007, Air New Zealand commissioned a number of New Zealanders living in Los Angeles and Southern California to create a sand sculpture of a silver fern on the Santa Monica Beach, creating a stir in the surrounding area.YouTube.com, Waitangi Day in Los Angeles Controversy and protest The flagstaff at Waitangi, the focus of significant protest. On the flagstaff is flown, from left, the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand; the Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Navy, and the Union Flag. By 1971, Waitangi and Waitangi Day had become a focus of protest concerning treaty injustices, with NgƒÅ Tamatoa leading early protests. Activists initially called for greater recognition of the treaty, but by the early 1980s, they were also arguing that it was a fraud and the means by which PƒÅkehƒÅ had conned MƒÅori out of their land. Attempts were made by groups, including the Waitangi Action Committee, to halt the commemorations.Hazlehurst, Kayleen M. (1995), 'Ethnicity, Ideology and Social Drama: The Waitangi Day Incident 1981' in Alisdair Rogers and Steven Vertovec, eds, The Urban Context: Ethnicity, Social Networks and Situational Analysis, Oxford and Washington D.C., p.83; Walker, Ranginui (1990), Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou: Struggle without End, Auckland, p.221. This led to confrontations between police and protesters, sometimes resulting in dozens of arrests. When the treaty gained greater official recognition in the mid-1980s, emphasis switched back to calls to honour it, and protesters generally returned to the aim of raising awareness of it and what they saw as its neglect by the state. Some New Zealand politicians and commentators, such as Paul Holmes, have felt that Waitangi Day is too controversial to be a national day and have sought to replace it with Anzac Day. Others, for example the United Future Party's Peter Dunne, have suggested that the name be changed back to New Zealand Day. =Recent protests= MƒÅori protestors in 2006 Several hundred protesters often gather at Waitangi to reflect long-standing frustrations manifested among MƒÅori since the signing of the treaty. Although not part of government commemorations, MƒÅori-sovereignty activists often fly the Tino Rangatiratanga flag from the flagstaff. Attempts at vandalism of the flagstaff are often an objective of these protests, carrying on a tradition that dates from the 19th century when Hone Heke chopped down the British flagstaff in nearby Russell. In 2004, protesters succeeded in flying the Tino Rangatiratanga flag above the other flags on the flagstaff by flying it from the top of a nearby tree. Because of the level of protest and threats that had previously occurred at Waitangi, Prime Minister Helen Clark did not attend in 2000. The official commemorations were shifted from Waitangi to Wellington for 2001. Some MƒÅori felt that this was an insult to them and to the treaty. In 2003 and 2004, the anniversary was again officially commemorated at the Treaty House at Waitangi. In 2004, Leader of the Opposition Don Brash was hit with mud as he entered the marae as a response to his controversial Orewa Speech that year. On 5 February 2009, the day before Waitangi Day, as then Prime Minister John Key was being escorted onto a marae, he was challenged and jostled by Wikitana and John Junior Popata, nephews of then MƒÅori Party MP Hone Harawira. Both admitted to assault and were sentenced to 100 hours of community service. In 2011, Wikitana and John again heckled Key as he entered the marae. A wet T-shirt thrown at Queen Elizabeth II and other attacks on various prime ministers at Waitangi on 6 February have resulted in a large police presence and a large contingent of the armed forces. In 2016 a nurse protesting against the proposed signing of the TPPA trade agreement threw a rubber dildo at Steven Joyce, the MP representing Prime Minister John Key, who had refused to attend, having been denied normal speaking rights. The woman was arrested but later released. In 2018, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visited Waitangi for five days, the longest any prime minister has stayed. Titewhai Harawira, a MƒÅori activist, greeted Ardern and escorted her onto the Treaty grounds holding hands, a significant change from her response to Helen Clark's visit in 1998, which brought Clark to tears. Ardern is also the first female prime minister to be given speaking rights on the marae by NgƒÅpuhi, who also offered to bury her child's placenta on the tribunal grounds. Ardern was praised for her speech during her visit where she said \\"one day I want to be able to tell my child that I earned the right to stand here, and only you can tell me when I have done that\\". Wally Haumaha, assistant commissioner, told the New Zealand Herald it was the best Waitangi Day commemoration he had attended in over a decade, saying, \\"I can retire gracefully and know that we saw this day where the government was treated with respect and dignity\\".

Date unknown. Woodcut of Li Hongzhang with Otto von Bismarck in Friedrichsruh in 1896. Li Hongzhang, Marquess Suyi (also romanised as Li Hung-chang; 15 February 1823 ‚Äì 7 November 1901) was a Chinese politician, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty. He quelled several major rebellions and served in important positions in the Qing imperial court, including the Viceroy of Zhili, Huguang and Liangguang. Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonised the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favour with the Chinese after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military defeats and praise on the other for his success against the Taiping Rebellion, his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernisation. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria. The French newspaper Le Si√®cle described him as \\"the yellow Bismarck.\\"  Names  Li Hongzhang was also known by other names. His courtesy names were Zifu () and Jianfu (). His art names were Shaoquan (), Yisou () and Shengxin (). The posthumous name awarded to him by the Qing government was Wenzhong (). He was also referred to as Li Zhongtang () and Li Fuxiang (); \\"Zhongtang\\" and \\"Fuxiang\\" referred to his honorary appointments as Grand Secretary and Crown Prince's Grand Tutor respectively. He also held the noble peerage First Class Count Suyi () and was posthumously honoured as First Class Marquis Suyi (). Biography =Early life and career= Li was born in a scholar-gentry family in Qunzhi Village (), Modian Township (), northeast of central Hefei, Anhui Province, China. In 1843, he sat for the entry-level imperial examination in Lu Prefecture and obtained a yougong (ÂÑ™Ë≤¢; or gongsheng Ë≤¢Áîü) position. His father, who was serving as an official in the imperial capital Beijing, was eager to see his son succeed, so he encouraged his son to come to Shuntian Prefecture to take the district-level examination. Li then travelled to Beijing. Along the way, he wrote ten poems under the collection Entering the Capital () to express his feelings. In 1844, Li obtained a juren () position in the district-level examination, but failed to make it in the metropolitan-level examination. He then started taking classes under Zeng Guofan. In 1847, he sat for the metropolitan-level examination again and obtained a jinshi () position at the young age of 24, and was admitted to the Hanlin Academy as a shujishi (). At the same time, he also continued taking classes under Zeng Guofan to improve his knowledge. Three years later, he took the sanguan () examination in the academy and earned the position of a bianxiu (Á∑®‰øÆ; an editor). =Suppressing the Taiping Rebellion= In January 1851, the God Worshipping Society led by Hong Xiuquan started the Taiping Rebellion in Guangxi Province. Within about two years, the rebels had conquered many territories in southern China and established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with Nanjing as their capital. In 1853, the rebels, advancing from Wuhan, captured Anqing and killed Jiang Wenqing (), the xunfu of Anhui Province. The Xianfeng Emperor commissioned L√º Xianji (), the Left Vice Secretary of Works, to travel to Anhui Province and recruit civilians to form militias to counter the rebels. L√º Xianji knew that Li was familiar with the local situation in Anhui Province so he secured permission from the imperial court to bring Li along with him as an adviser and assistant. Li was later ordered to remain in Anhui to oversee the militia. In late 1853, the Taiping rebels defeated imperial forces and captured Shucheng County; L√º Xianji committed suicide. In the following year, Jiang Zhongyuan (), the xunfu of Anhui Province, committed suicide after Lu Prefecture fell to the rebels. Li then became a subordinate of Fuji (), the new xunfu, who ordered him to lead troops to attack the rebels. Li recaptured two counties and Lu Prefecture from the rebels within the following year. For his achievements, he earned the appointment of a daotai (ÈÅìÂè∞; circuit administrator) and the privilege of wearing a single-eyed peacock feather in his hat. Later, he led troops into the Huai River area, but could not get along with his subordinates and was forced to abandon his mission. In the winter of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where he was in charge of drafting documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, \\"Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the only thing that matters to us here.\\" Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: \\"It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [to point out the failures of my colleague.] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige.\\" Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit () in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng. In 1860, Li was put in command in the naval forces in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces to counter the Taiping rebels. After Zeng Guofan's Xiang Army recaptured Anqing from the rebels in 1861, Zeng wrote a memorial to the imperial court to praise Li, calling him \\"a talent with great potential\\", and sent Li back to Hefei to form a militia. Li managed to recruit enough men to form five battalions in 1862. Zeng Guofan ordered him to bring his troops along with him to Shanghai. Li and his men sailed past rebel-controlled territory along the Yangtze River in British steamboats ‚Äì the rebels did not attack because Britain was a neutral party ‚Äì and arrived in Shanghai, where they were commissioned as the Huai Army. Zeng Guofan recommended Li to serve as the xunfu of Jiangsu Province. After gaining ground in Jiangsu, Li focused on enhancing the Huai Army's capabilities, including equipping them with Western firearms and artillery. Within two years, the Huai Army's strength increased from 6,000 to about 60‚Äì70,000 men. Li's Huai Army combined forces later with Zeng Guofan's Xiang Army and Charles George Gordon's Ever Victorious Army and prepared to attack the Taiping rebels. From 1863 to 1864, Li led the Huai Army to attack and recapture Suzhou, Changzhou and other rebel-controlled territories. For his contributions, Li was awarded the honorary appointment Crown Prince's Grand Protector () and an imperial yellow jacket. After retaking Changzhou, and capturing and executing the rebel leader Chen Kunshu, Li received a jiduwei peerage in recognition of his achievements. An incident connected with the surrender of Suzhou soured Li's relationship with Gordon. According to an earlier arrangement with Gordon, the rebel leaders agreed to yield Nanjing to imperial forces on the condition that their lives would be spared. However, after the capture of Nanjing, Li ordered the rebel leaders to be executed. This breach of faith infuriated Gordon so much that he grabbed a rifle and wanted to shoot Li, but Li fled. By the end of 1864, the Taiping Rebellion had basically been suppressed by imperial forces. Li was awarded a noble peerage as \\"First Class Count Suyi\\" () and the privilege of wearing a double-eyed peacock feather in his hat. =As Viceroy of Zhili= After the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion in 1864, Li assumed a civil office as the xunfu of Jiangsu Province for about two years. However, on the outbreak of the Nian Rebellion in Henan and Shandong provinces in 1866, he was ordered to lead troops into battle again. After some misadventures, Li managed to suppress the movement. In recognition of his contributions, he was appointed as Assistant Grand Secretary (). In 1867, Li was appointed as the Viceroy of Huguang, where he remained until 1870, when the Tianjin Massacre necessitated his transfer to Tianjin to handle the diplomatic crisis with the French. He was given the concurrent appointments as Viceroy of Zhili Province and Beiyang Trade Minister () to oversee various issues in Zhili, Shandong and Fengtian provinces, including trade, tariffs, diplomacy, coastal defence, and modernisation. He was also conferred the honorary position of \\"Grand Secretary of Wenhua Hall\\" (). From the time he became Viceroy of Zhili and Beiyang Trade Minister until his death, with a few intervals of retirement, he shaped the Qing Empire's foreign policy to a large extent. In 1876, he signed the Yantai Treaty with Sir Thomas Wade to end a diplomatic crisis with Britain caused by the murder of Augustus Raymond Margary in Yunnan Province. He also arranged treaties with Peru and the Tianjin Convention with Japan, and directed Chinese foreign policy in Korea. Among Li's projects to open China to the world on Chinese terms was support for the Chinese Educational Mission, which sent Chinese boys to the United States for education, starting in 1872. The mission was aborted in 1881. On the death of the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875, Li introduced a large army into the capital and effected a coup which placed the Guangxu Emperor on the throne under the regency of the Empress Dowagers Ci'an and Cixi. In 1879, Li was awarded the honorary appointment Crown Prince's Grand Tutor (). In 1886, on the conclusion of the Sino-French War, Li arranged a treaty with the French. Li was impressed with the necessity of strengthening the Qing Empire, and while he was Viceroy of Zhili, he raised a large well- drilled and well-armed force, and spent vast sums both in fortifying Port Arthur and the Dagu forts and in strengthening the navy. For years, he had watched the successful reforms effected in Japan and had a well-founded dread of coming into conflict with the Japanese. =Establishing military academies= A painting of Li Hongzhang In 1885, Li founded the Tianjin Military Academy () to train Chinese military officers as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Huai Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Huai Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematics and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German military officers. Another programme was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new military officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects, sciences, foreign languages, Chinese classics and history were taught at the school. Students also took exams. The Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools copied the Tianjin Military Academy's curriculum. The maritime defence fund supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. =First Sino-Japanese War= Li Hongzhang in U. S. Government engraved portrait Because of his prominent role in Chinese diplomacy in Korea and strong political connections in Manchuria, Li found himself directing Chinese forces during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895. In fact, it was mostly the armies that he established and controlled that did the fighting, whereas other Chinese troops led by his political rivals did not come to their aid. Rampant corruption further weakened the Chinese military. For instance, one official misappropriated ammunition funds for personal use. As a result, shells ran out during battle, forcing one navy captain, Deng Shichang, to resort to ordering his ship to ram an enemy ship. The defeat of Li's modernised armed forces by the Japanese undermined his political standing, as well as the wider cause of the Self- Strengthening Movement. Li had received the privilege of wearing a three-eyed peacock feather in his hat ‚Äì a rare exception because three-eyed peacock feathers had previously been restricted to only members of the imperial clan ‚Äì during Empress Dowager Cixi's 60th birthday celebrations in 1894. However, after the Chinese defeat in the war, Li was disgraced and stripped of his peacock feather. The Qing imperial court initially wanted to send Zhang Yinhuan () and Shao Youlian () as their representatives to negotiate with the Japanese, but the Japanese rejected them. Li was selected to take on this mission and was given back his peacock feather. On 24 March 1895, while negotiating with Japan's Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi and Foreign Affairs Minister Mutsu Munemitsu in Shimonoseki, Li was attacked by an assassin, Koyama Toyotar≈ç (), who shot him in the left cheek. Koyama was arrested by Japanese police later and he claimed that he desired for the war to continue. Due to the public embarrassment caused by the attack, the Japanese agreed to the immediate ceasefire Li had urged in the days before.Mutsu, Munemitsu. (1982). Kenkenroku, p. 174. On 17 April 1895, Li signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki with the Japanese, thus ending the First Sino-Japanese War. =Tour of Russia, Europe and North America= Guth in Vanity Fair, 13 August 1896 Hongzhang's arrival at Vancouver in 1896, in the British library In 1896, Li attended the coronation of Nicholas II of the Russian Empire on behalf of the Qing Empire and toured Europe, Canada and the United States, where he advocated reform of the American immigration policies that had greatly restricted Chinese immigration after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (renewed in 1892). In a famous interview published by The New York Times on September 3, 1896, Li was asked whether he favored the introduction of the newspaper into China as developed in the U.S. or in Europe. Li's answer was stunningly honest: \\"There are newspapers in China, but the Chinese editors, unfortunately, do not tell the truth. They do not, as your papers, tell 'the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth.' The editors in China are great economizers of the truth; they tell only a part of it. They do not have, therefore, the great circulations that your papers have. Because this economy of the truth, our papers fail in the mission of a great press, to be one of the means of civilization.\\" While in Britain, he toured parts of the country by train, keeping with his desire to inspire railway development in his own country while constantly fighting against the prejudices of conservative leaders. He visited the industrial area in Barrow, North West England, and toured Lake Windermere on the steamer Tern operated by the Furness Railway Company. He also witnessed the 1896 Royal Naval Fleet Review at Spithead. It was during his visit to Britain in 1896 that Queen Victoria made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.Antony Best, \\"Race, Monarchy, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, 1902‚Äì1922,\\"Social Science Japan Journal 2006 9(2):171‚Äì186 =Boxer Rebellion and death= In 1900, Li once more played a major diplomatic role in negotiating a settlement with the Eight-Nation Alliance forces which had invaded Beijing to put down the Boxer Rebellion. His early position was that the Qing Empire was making a mistake by supporting the Boxers against the foreign powers. During the Siege of the International Legations, Sheng Xuanhuai and other provincial officials suggested that the Qing imperial court give Li full diplomatic power to negotiate with foreign powers. Li telegraphed back to Sheng Xuanhuai on 25 June, describing the declaration of war a \\"false edict\\". This tactic gave the \\"Southeast Mutual Protection\\" provincial officials a justification not to follow Empress Dowager Cixi's declaration of war. Li refused to accept orders from the government for more troops when they were needed to fight against the foreigners, which he had available. Li controlled the Chinese telegraph service, whose despatches asserted falsely that Chinese forces had exterminated all foreigners in the siege and convinced many foreign readers. In 1901, Li was the principal Chinese negotiator with the foreign powers which captured Beijing. On 7 September 1901, he signed the Boxer Protocol ending the Boxer Rebellion, and obtained the departure of the Eight-Nation Alliance at the price of huge indemnities for the Chinese. Exhausted from the negotiations, he died from liver inflammation two months later at Xianliang Temple in Beijing. The Guangxu Emperor posthumously honoured Li as Marquis Suyi of the First Class (). This peerage was inherited by Li Guojie, who was assassinated in Shanghai on 21February 1939, allegedly as a result of his support for the Nanking Reformed Government. Family Li's ancestral family name was actually X«î (). His ancestors had migrated from Hukou, Jiangxi Province to Hefei, Anhui Province. Li's eighth-great-grandfather, Xu Yingxi (), had given up his second son, Xu Shen (), for adoption by a relative, Li Xinzhuang (). Xu Shen and his descendants had taken Li () to be their family name since then. Li's father, Li Wen'an (ÊùéÊñáÂÆâ; 1801‚Äì1855), obtained a jinshi degree in the imperial examination in 1838 ‚Äì the same year as Zeng Guofan. Li Wen'an also served as a langzhong () in the Ministry of Justice. Li had one elder brother and four younger brothers; he was the second son in his family. His elder brother, Li Hanzhang (ÊùéÁÄöÁ´†; 1821‚Äì1899), served as a xunfu and zongdu in a number of provinces. His third brother, Li Hezhang (ÊùéÈ∂¥Á´†; 1825‚Äì1880), served as a military officer. His fourth brother was Li Yunzhang (), his fifth brother was Li Fengzhang (), and his sixth brother was Li Zhaoqing (ÊùéÊò≠ÊÖ∂; 1835‚Äì1873). Li's first primary spouse, Lady Zhou (), bore him a son, Li Jingyu (), who died prematurely. Lady Zhou died of illness in 1861. Li's second primary spouse, Zhao Xiaolian (), bore him another son, Li Jingshu (). Li Jingshu inherited his father's peerage as Marquis Suyi (), but died early. Li Jingshu's son, Li Guojie (ÊùéÂúãÂÇë; 1881‚Äì1939), inherited the Marquis Suyi peerage and served in a number of official positions in the final years of the Qing dynasty. He became an official and industrialist in the Republic of China later. Li Guojie also married the daughter of Natong (ÈÇ£Ê°ê; 1857‚Äì1925), who served in the Grand Secretariat and Grand Council. Li's secondary spouse, Lady Mo (), bore him three sons: Li Jingyuan (), Li Jingmai (ÊùéÁ∂ìÈÇÅ; 1876‚Äì1938) and Li Jingjin (). Among the three, only Li Jingmai survived into adulthood. He served as the Qing Empire's Ambassador to Austria-Hungary and a Right Vice Secretary () in the Ministry of Civil Affairs (). Li had three daughters. One of them, Li Ju'ou (), married Zhang Peilun (1848‚Äì1903) and bore the father of the writer Eileen Chang (1920‚Äì1995). The other two daughters married Guo Enhou (), the magistrate of Weifang County, and Ren Dehe (), the zhushi () of Yixing County. Li also adopted Li Jingfang (1855‚Äì1934), a son of his sixth brother Li Zhaoqing. Li Jingfang served as the Qing Empire's Ambassador to Japan and a Left Vice Secretary () in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (). Li's brother Li Hanzhang () had a daughter named Li Peisheng (). Honours * Order of the Double Dragon (China) * Royal Victorian Order (United Kingdom) * Order of the Red Eagle (Germany) Legacy and assessment Li left a word as his self-evaluation: \\"To know me and judge me is a task for the next millennium\\" (). Because of Li's reputation for welcoming foreign influence and his 1896 visit to the United States, he was regarded favourably there. He was wrongly credited with inventing the American Chinese dish chop suey during that visit. In 1913, William Francis Mannix wrote and published a fabricated Memoirs of Li Hung Chang which received widespread praise before being exposed as a forgery in 1923. William J. Hail said Li \\"did perhaps all he could for a land where the conservatism of the people, a reactionary officialdom, and unrestrained international rivalry made each step forward a matter of great difficulty,\\" and praised him as \\"always progressive, yet patient and conciliatory, it was his fate to bear blame for failures which might have been avoided if he had had his way.\\" The leader of China's New Culture Movement, Hu Shih was also sympathetic, remarking that if Li had been allowed the opportunity, his achievement for China might have equalled the achievement of his Japanese counterpart, It≈ç Hirobumi, at the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki. Chinese nationalists criticised Li's relations with the Western powers and Japan. Liang Qichao's 1902 biography of Li blamed him for China's woes and set the tone for further castigation. In Liang's view, Li was the chief culprit for the Self-Strengthening Movement, which these nationalists condemned for collaborating with the European imperialists and suppressing the masses. Liang Qichao's son, Liang Sicheng, denounced Li in 1951 for \\"selling out\\" the country. History textbooks in the People's Republic of China labelled Li as a \\"feudalist\\" and a traitor to the Chinese people. It was not until the 1980s that mainland historians began a serious debate of the sort which had been taking place in Taiwan. =Bribery controversy= Sergei Witte dismissed some rumours during Li's visit to Europe that Li was bribed. However, according to the Russian account, Li had urged the Russian government to build a three- million rubles' \\"Li Hongzhang Foundation\\" to make Li and Zhang Yinheng to support the Sino-Russia railway treaty and Lushun-Dalian Rent Treaty, and a payment of 0.5 million rubles was confirmed.„Ää‰øÑÂõΩÁöÑËøú‰∏úÊîøÁ≠ñ--1881~1904„Äã ÔºàÂïÜÂä°Âç∞‰π¶È¶Ü 1977Ôºâ Ma Wenzhong questioned whether the Russian account is reliable.„ÄäÊóÖÂ§ßÁßüÂÄü‰∫§Ê∂â‰∏≠ÊùéÈ∏øÁ´†„ÄÅÂº†Ëç´Ê°ìÁöÑ‚ÄúÂèóË¥ø‚ÄùÈóÆÈ¢ò Ôºà„ÄäÂ≠¶ÊúØÁïå„Äã2003Âπ¥Á¨¨2ÊúüÔºâ Works * Trade Charter Precedents Collection (ÈÄöÂïÜÁ¥ÑÁ´†ÊàêÊ°àÂΩôÁ∑® 1886)  See also  * Battle of Shanghai (1861) * Beiyang Army * Military history of China (pre-1911) * Self- Strengthening Movement * Tune of Li Zhongtang Notes References  * Further reading Words on Li Hung Chang from the Papers of Charles Daniel Tenney * Reminiscences of Li Hung Chang from the Papers of Charles Daniel Tenney 1823 births 1901 deaths Politicians from Hefei Chinese people of the Boxer Rebellion People of the First Sino-Japanese War People of the Sino-French War Political office-holders in Guangdong Political office- holders in Hubei Political office-holders in Tianjin Qing dynasty diplomats Qing dynasty politicians from Anhui Recipients of the Order of the Double Dragon Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Qing dynasty governors of Jiangsu Members of the Xiang Army Huai Army personnel Grand Secretaries of the Qing dynasty Assistant Grand Secretaries Viceroys of Huguang Viceroys of Liangguang Viceroys of Zhili Viceroys of Liangjiang Chinese nobility Beiyang Fleet personnel Ministers of Zongli Yamen ","title":"Li Hongzhang"},{"id":"249268","text":"A group is a set together with an associative operation which admits an identity element and such that every element has an inverse. Throughout the article, we use e to denote the identity element of a group.  A   C   D   F   G   H   I   L   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T  Basic definitions Subgroup. A subset H of a group (G, *) which remains a group when the operation * is restricted to H is called a subgroup of G. Given a subset S of G. We denote by ~~the smallest subgroup of G containing S. ~~is called the subgroup of G generated by S. Normal subgroup. H is a normal subgroup of G if for all g in G and h in H, g * h * g^{-1}also belongs to H. Both subgroups and normal subgroups of a given group form a complete lattice under inclusion of subsets; this property and some related results are described by the lattice theorem. Group homomorphism. These are functions f\\\\colon (G,*) \\\\to (H,\\\\times) that have the special property that : f(a * b) = f(a) \\\\times f(b), for any elements a and b of G. Kernel of a group homomorphism. It is the preimage of the identity in the codomain of a group homomorphism. Every normal subgroup is the kernel of a group homomorphism and vice versa. Group isomorphism. Group homomorphisms that have inverse functions. The inverse of an isomorphism, it turns out, must also be a homomorphism. Isomorphic groups. Two groups are isomorphic if there exists a group isomorphism mapping from one to the other. Isomorphic groups can be thought of as essentially the same, only with different labels on the individual elements. One of the fundamental problems of group theory is the classification of groups up to isomorphism. Direct product, direct sum, and semidirect product of groups. These are ways of combining groups to construct new groups; please refer to the corresponding links for explanation. Types of groups Finitely generated group. If there exists a finite set S such that ~~=G, then G is said to be finitely generated. If S can be taken to have just one element, G is a cyclic group of finite order, an infinite cyclic group, or possibly a group \\\\\\\\{e\\\\\\\\} with just one element. Simple group. Simple groups are those groups having only e and themselves as normal subgroups. The name is misleading because a simple group can in fact be very complex. An example is the monster group, whose order is about 1054. Every finite group is built up from simple groups via group extensions, so the study of finite simple groups is central to the study of all finite groups. The finite simple groups are known and classified. The structure of any finite abelian group is relatively simple; every finite abelian group is the direct sum of cyclic p-groups. This can be extended to a complete classification of all finitely generated abelian groups, that is all abelian groups that are generated by a finite set. The situation is much more complicated for the non-abelian groups. Free group. Given any set A, one can define a group as the smallest group containing the free semigroup of A. The group consists of the finite strings (words) that can be composed by elements from A, together with other elements that are necessary to form a group. Multiplication of strings is defined by concatenation, for instance (abb)*(bca)=abbbca. Every group (G, *) is basically a factor group of a free group generated by G. Please refer to presentation of a group for more explanation. One can then ask algorithmic questions about these presentations, such as: * Do these two presentations specify isomorphic groups?; or * Does this presentation specify the trivial group? The general case of this is the word problem, and several of these questions are in fact unsolvable by any general algorithm. General linear group, denoted by GL(n, F), is the group of n-by-n invertible matrices, where the elements of the matrices are taken from a field F such as the real numbers or the complex numbers. Group representation (not to be confused with the presentation of a group). A group representation is a homomorphism from a group to a general linear group.

It is generally less preferred than the tetracycline doxycycline. It is also used for the treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, allergic reactions, and kidney problems. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, a lupus-like syndrome, and easy sunburning. Use in the later part of pregnancy may harm the baby and safety during breastfeeding is unclear. It works by decreasing a bacterium's ability to make protein thus stopping its growth. Minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£14 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$12. In 2017, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses Minocycline 100-mg capsules manufactured by Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals =Acne= Minocycline and doxycycline are frequently used for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Both of these closely related antibiotics have similar levels of efficacy, although doxycycline has a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. Historically, minocycline has been an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, acne that is caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. In Europe and North America, a number of people with acne no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily Cutibacterium acnes) that are resistant to these antibiotics. In order to reduce resistance rates as well as increase the effectiveness of treatment, oral antibiotics should be generally combined with topical acne creams such as benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid (tretinoin, adapalene, etc.). Minocycline itself is used both orally and topically in the treatment of acne. =Infections= Minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as Lyme disease, as the one pill twice daily 100-mg dosage is far easier for patients than the four times a day required with tetracycline or oxytetracycline. Its superior ability to cross the blood-brain barrier adds to its effectiveness against Lyme disease. Although minocycline's broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against Neisseria meningitidis, its use for prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo). It may be used to treat certain strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and a disease caused by drug- resistant Acinetobacter spp. A list of uses includes: * Amoebic dysentery * Anthrax * Bubonic plague * Cholera * Ehrlichiosis * Gonorrhea (when penicillin cannot be given) * Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome (confluent and reticulated papillomatosis) * Hidradenitis suppurativa * For use as an adjuvant to HAART * Periodontal disease * Perioral dermatitisU.S. National Library of Medicine (2009, Dec 11) 'Perioral dermatitis'. Retrieved 7 August 2010. * Respiratory infections such as pneumonia * Rocky Mountain spotted fever * Rosacea * Syphilis (when penicillin cannot be given) * Urinary tract infections, rectal infections, and infections of the cervix caused by certain microbes =Other= Both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune-suppressing effects. Minocycline and doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline. Recent research indicate that centrally infused minocycline attenuates brain microglial activation, neuroinflammation and sympathetic activation during pulmonary hypertension Contraindications The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics, as there is complete cross sensitivity in this group. It is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment and after the 16th week of pregnancy. Side effects Minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, headache, and vomiting. It increases sensitivity to sunlight, and may affect the quality of sleep and rarely causes sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline can lead to blue-gray staining of skin, fingernails, and scar tissue. This staining is not permanent, but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; however, a muddy brown skin color in sun- exposed areas is usually permanent. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.MedicineNet: Minocycline Oral (Dynacin, Minocin) - side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions Occasionally, minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug-related lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, which usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline-induced lupus; however, women are more likely to develop minocycline-induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline-induced autoimmune problems within a period of a few weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy, but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances with dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, and tinnitus. These effects are thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50 to 70% of women receiving minocycline. As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage if not recognized early and treated. Contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis. Minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension, which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. Brain swelling and rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects of minocycline in some people. Minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date.\\"Principles and methods for the assessment of nephrotoxicity associated with exposure to chemicals\\". Environmental health criteria: 119. World Health Organization (WHO). . ISSN 0250-863X. 1991 While most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. Expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline. Minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly. Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep.Drugs.com 'Minocycline Disease Interactions'. Retrieved 12 February 2017. A 2007 study suggested that minocycline harms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. The effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses. Interactions The combination of minocycline with dairy, antacids, calcium and magnesium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness by forming chelates. Combining it with isotretinoin, acitretin or other retinoids can increase the risk for intracranial hypertension. Minocycline significantly reduces concentrations of the anti-HIV drug atazanavir in the body. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= =Pharmacokinetics= Minocycline is quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. Taking it together with food, including milk, has no relevant influence on resorption. It reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after one to two hours and has a plasma protein binding of 70‚Äì75%. The substance penetrates into almost all tissues; very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder and liver. It crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier better than doxycycline and other tetracyclines, reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and also in inflamed meninges. Minocycline is inactivated by metabolization in the liver to about 50%. The rest is predominantly excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels) and eliminated via the feces. About 10‚Äì15% are eliminated via the kidneys. The biological half-life is 14‚Äì22 (11‚Äì26) hours in healthy people, up to 30 hours in those with kidney failure, and significantly longer in those with liver disease. Chemistry The drug is used in form of minocycline hydrochloride dihydrate, which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Minocycline reacts acidic in aqueous solution. History Minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. A topical foam for treatment of acne was approved in 2019. Society and culture =Trade names= Many forms of minocycline are no longer covered by patent, so it is marketed under a variety of trade names: * Minomycin * Minostad (in Europe, for the treatment of acne) * Akamin * Minocin * Minoderm * Cyclimycin * Arestin (1-mg doses administered locally into periodontal pockets, after scaling and root planing, for treatment of periodontal disease.) * Aknemin * Solodyn (extended-release, for the treatment of acne) * Dynacin * Sebomin * Mino-Tabs * Acnamino * Minopen (in Japan) * Maracyn 2 (for treatment of bacterial infections in aquarium fish and amphibians) * Quatrocin (in Syria) * Minox (in Ireland) * Minoz (in India and Romania) * Divaine (in India) * Dentomycin (2% minocylcine gel for use in periodontal pockets) StoneBridge Pharma also markets Minocycline as Cleeravue-M in combination with SteriLid eyelid cleanser in the treatment of rosacea blepharitis. =Cost= It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£14 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$12. In October 2015, a bottle of 30 of tablets of one brand cost $1,040.41 wholesale. Expensive medications like this were sold through the specialty pharmacy Philidor by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in a 2015 controversial legal tangle involving both companies. Research Early research has found a tentative benefit from minocycline in schizophrenia, with several trials underway. A 2014 meta- analysis found minocycline may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated. Current research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As mentioned above, minocycline harms ALS patients. Minocycline is also known to indirectly inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase. A trial found no difference between minocycline and placebo in people with Alzheimers' disease. Minocycline also has been used as a \\"last-ditch\\" treatment for toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Minocycline is somewhat neuroprotective in mouse models of Huntington's disease. A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three- month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS. The overall antidepressant effect size of minocycline compared to placebo in a meta-analysis was -0.78, indicative of a potential antidepressant effect. =Data from cellular and animal models= * PARP1 inhibition Ki = 13.8 nM * Neuroprotection IC50 = 10 nM * Microglia full inhibition = 20 nM * Suppression of the mouse's locomotor activity = 0.5 mg/kgminomycin-if References External links * Anti-acne preparations Hepatotoxins Neuroprotective agents NMDA receptor antagonists PARP inhibitors Tetracycline antibiotics Triketones Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Minocycline"},{"id":"249272","text":"The red-necked wallaby or Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) is a medium-sized macropod marsupial (wallaby), common in the more temperate and fertile parts of eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Red-necked wallabies have been introduced to several other countries, including New Zealand, the United Kingdom (in England and Scotland), Ireland, the Isle of Man, France and Germany. Description The skull of a red-necked wallaby Red-necked wallabies are distinguished by their black nose and paws, white stripe on the upper lip, and grizzled medium grey coat with a reddish wash across the shoulders. They can weigh and attain a head-body length of , although males are generally bigger than females. Red-necked wallabies are very similar in appearance to the black-striped wallaby (Macropus dorsalis), the only difference being that red-necked wallabies are larger, lack a black stripe down the back, and have softer fur. Red-necked wallabies may live up to 9 years. Distribution and habitat Red-necked wallabies are found in coastal scrub and sclerophyll forest throughout coastal and highland eastern Australia, from Bundaberg, Queensland to the South Australian border; in Tasmania and on many of the Bass Strait islands. It is unclear which of the Tasmanian islands have native populations as opposed to introduced ones. In Tasmania and coastal Queensland, their numbers have expanded over the past 30 years because of a reduction in hunting pressure and the partial clearing of forest to result in a mosaic of pastures where wallabies can feed at night, alongside bushland where they can shelter by day. For reasons not altogether clear, they are less common in Victoria. Behaviour Two adult males fighting Red-necked wallabies are mainly solitary but will gather together when there is an abundance of resources such as food, water or shelter. When they do gather in groups, they have a social hierarchy similar to other wallaby species. A recent study has demonstrated that wallabies, as other social or gregarious mammals, are able to manage conflict via reconciliation, involving the post-conflict reunion, after a fight, of former opponents, which engage in affinitive contacts.Cordoni, G., Norscia, I., 2014: Peace-Making in Marsupials: The First Study in the Red-Necked Wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) PLOS One 9(1): e86859. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086859 Red-necked wallabies are mainly nocturnal. They spend most of the daytime resting. A female's estrus lasts 33 days. During courting, the female first licks the male's neck. The male will then rub his cheek against the female's. Then the male and female will fight briefly, standing upright like two males. After that they finally mate. A couple will stay together for one day before separating. A female bears one offspring at a time; young stay in the pouch for about 280 days, after which females and their offspring stay together for only a month. However, females may stay in the home range of their mothers for life, while males leave at the age of two. Also, red-necked wallabies engage in alloparental care, in which one individual may adopt the child of another. This is a common behavior seen in many other animal species like wolves, elephants, and fathead minnows.Riedman, Marianne L. (December 1982). \\"The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds\\". The Quarterly Review of Biology 57 (4): 405-435 =Diet= Red-necked wallabies diets consists of grasses, roots, tree leaves, and weeds. Subspecies There are three subspecies. *red-necked wallaby (M. r. banksianus) (Quoy & Gaimard, 1825) * M. r. fruticus (Ogilby, 1838) *Bennett's wallaby (M. r. rufogriseus) (Desmarest, 1817) The Tasmanian subspecies, Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus, usually known as Bennett's wallaby, is smaller (as island subspecies often are), has longer, darker and shaggier fur, and breeds in the late summer, mostly between February and April. They have adapted to living in proximity to humans and can be found grazing on lawns in the fringes of Hobart and other urban areas. The mainland Australian subspecies, Macropus rufogriseus banksianus, usually known as the red-necked wallaby, breeds all year round. Captive animals maintain their breeding schedules; Tasmanian females that become pregnant out of their normal season delay birth until summer, which can be anywhere up to 8 months later. Introductions to other countries albino Bennett's wallabies (M. r. rufogriseus) live on Bruny Island There are significant introduced populations in the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island. In 1870, several Bennett's wallabies were transported from Tasmania to Christchurch, New Zealand. Two females and one male from this stock were later released about Te Waimate, the property of Waimate's first European settler Michael Studholme. The year 1874 saw them freed in the Hunters Hills, where over the years their population has dramatically increased. Bennett's wallabies are now resident on approximately 350,000 ha of terrain centred upon the Hunters Hills, including the Two Thumb Ranges, the Kirkliston Range and the Grampians. They have been declared an animal pest in the Canterbury region and land occupiers must contain the wallabies within specified areas.Bennett's wallaby is now widely regarded as a symbol of Waimate. There are also colonies in Englandin the Peak District, Derbyshire, and the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex. These were established ca. 1900. There are also other smaller groups frequently spotted in West Sussex and Hampshire. There is a small colony of red-necked wallabies on the island of Inchconnachan, Loch Lomond in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. This was founded in 1975 with two pairs taken from the Whipsnade Zoo, and had risen to 26 individuals by 1993. There is a large group of approximately 250 red-necked wallabies living wild on the Isle of Man, which are the descendants of a pair that escaped from a wildlife park on the island in the 1970s, as well as from subsequent escapes. The Baring family, who owned Lambay Island (), off the eastern coast of Ireland introduced red- necked wallabies to the island in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1980s, the red- necked wallaby population at the Dublin Zoo was growing out of control. Unable to find another zoo to take them, and unwilling to euthanize them, zoo director Peter Wilson donated seven individuals to the Barings. The animals have thrived since then and the current population is estimated to be between 30 and 50. In France, in the southern part of the Forest of Rambouillet, west from Paris, there is a wild group of around 50-100 Bennett's wallabies. This population has been present since the 1970s, when some individuals escaped from the zoological park of √âmanc√© after a storm. In Germany, around 10 wallabies live as a wild population in the federated state of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern since 2001.as of 2. Dezember 2014. In October 2014, three captive Bennett's wallabies escaped into the wild in northern Austria and one of them roamed the area for three months before being recaptured, surprisingly surviving the harsh winter there. The case attracted media attention, as it humorously defeated the popular slogan \\"There are no kangaroos in Austria.\\" Gallery Wallaby joey face in pouch.jpgA joey in a pouch Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus Juvenile 2.jpgA juvenile Bennett's wallaby (M. r. rufogriseus) File:Red necked wallaby444.jpgA red-necked wallaby (M. r. banksianus) References Macropods Mammals described in 1817 Mammals of Tasmania Mammals of South Australia Mammals of New South Wales Mammals of Queensland Mammals of Victoria (Australia) Marsupials of Australia Waimate District ","title":"Red-necked wallaby"},{"id":"249274","title":"Mike Rossman"},{"id":"249282","text":"Arms of de Vere: Quarterly gules and or, in the first quarter a mullet argent heraldic achievement of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, with Latin canting motto Vero Nihil Verius (\\"Nothing more true than truth\\") Earl of Oxford is a dormant title in the Peerage of England, first created for Edgar the Atheling and held by him from 1066 to 1068, and later offered to Aubrey III de Vere by the Empress Matilda in 1141, one of four counties he could choose if Cambridgeshire was held by the King of Scotland. On Aubrey's acceptance, his family was to hold the title for more than five and a half centuries, until the death of the 20th Earl in 1703. The de Veres were also hereditary holders of the office of Master Chamberlain of England from 1133 until the death of the 18th Earl in 1625. Their primary seat was Hedingham Castle in Essex, but they held lands in southern England and the Midlands, particularly in eastern England. The actual earldom was called 'Oxenford' until at least the end of the 17th century. Medieval sources thus refer to 'my lord of Oxenford' when speaking of the earl. Earls of Oxford (1141) Hedingham Castle in Essex, primary seat of the Earls of Oxford Soon after his father's death in 1141, Aubrey III de Vere was recruited by Empress Matilda. Aubrey's brother-in-law, Geoffrey de Mandeville first earl of Essex, apparently negotiated the offer of the earldom of Cambridge, with a secondary offer of one of four counties if Cambridgeshire was claimed by her kinsman. Aubrey held no land in Oxfordshire at the time, but his eldest son Aubrey IV was to marry an heiress with manors in that county. Aubrey IV was supposedly an ally of King John, while his brother Robert, the 3rd Earl was one of the 25 barons of Magna Carta. His descendant, another Robert, the 9th Earl, was a favourite of King Richard II who created him Duke of Ireland. John the 13th Earl was a Lancastrian during the War of the Roses and Henry Tudor's commander at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.G. E. Cokayne, et al., eds., The Complete Peerage, 2nd ed., vol. 10. The 17th Earl has become the most famous of the line because of his emergence as a popular alternative candidate as the actual author of the works of William Shakespeare (see Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship). The 17th Earl was a ward and later son-in-law of Lord Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's Secretary of State. On the death of the 20th Earl, without identifiable heirs male, the title became dormant. The Earls of Oxford held no subsidiary titles, and so their heirs apparent were styled by invented courtesy titles: initially Lord Vere, and later Viscount Bolebec (sometimes spelled Viscount Bulbeck). The principal Oxford coat of arms or shield was quarterly gules and or (red and yellow) with an argent (white) five-pointed star called a mullet or molet in the first canton. By De Vere family tradition this molet is said to refer to a reappearance of the Star of Bethlehem which showed itself to an earlier De Vere while on a Crusade and thus led him to victory. In the 14th and 15th centuries the family livery worn by their retainers was orange/tawney decorated with a white molet. A later badge associated with the De Veres is a blue boar. A later shield variation of the De Vere white molet has a smaller blue molet located within the white one but this may be a simple cadency mark ‚Äì in heraldry the molet is also used in any family to indicate the third son of a title holder. The third son bears his father's arms differenced with a molet. A confusion between the De Vere white molet and Edward IV's sunburst and white rose is said to have led to the friendly fire incident between Neville men and De Vere's men at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. Fighting in fog, the Nevilles (former Yorkists) fired on their De Vere (staunch Lancastrian) allies and thus brought about the collapse of the Lancastrian centre and right.

This was followed by a single, \\"Broke\\", recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman Seasick Steve) under Sub Pop records at Moon Studios in Olympia, Washington. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, Sad Sappy Sucker, but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten.

The 1997 album, The Lonesome Crowded West (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following, and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock. During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP The Fruit That Ate Itself.

The album would later receive further acclaim. The band licensed \\"Gravity Rides Everything\\" for a Nissan Quest minivan advertisement, a move that Brock has publicly acknowledged as blatantly commercial but necessary to achieve financial stability. Regarding the commercial, Brock stated, \\"People who don't have to make their living playing music can bitch about my principles while they spend their parents' money or wash dishes for some asshole.\\" In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks, a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of The Moon and Antarctica.

KƒÅwanatanga was first used in the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand, 1835. It reappeared in 1840 when the Treaty of Waitangi was being translated from English into MƒÅori. It was used there to translate the concept of sovereignty. Some historians believe that there was no existing suitable word in the MƒÅori language at the time; however, many MƒÅori believe that the word mana would have provided appropriate meaning. One supposition is that if mana had been used instead of the new, transliterated kƒÅwana tanga, the treaty would never had been signed. Origin and etymology The first part of the word, KƒÅwana, is a transliteration into MƒÅori of the English word governor. The suffix -tanga is very similar in meaning and use to the English suffix -ship, for example rangatiratanga (chieftainship) and kƒ´ngitanga (kingship). So a literal translation of the word would be governorship. From an idiomatic perspective, this word had little meaning to the chiefs signing the treaty, since the concept of being governed by an overseeing authority was alien to MƒÅori. What understanding MƒÅori may have had of the term was derived principally from the Bible and in particular Herod's Governorship.Maori Bible, Matthew 2 (this text does not use macrons, thus kƒÅwana appears as kawana) At the time the Bible was one of few long printed texts in MƒÅori enjoying wide distribution. Use in the Treaty of Waitangi The meaning attached to this word, and in particular how it relates to rangatiratanga is vital to discussion of the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is still vitally important in modern New Zealand, and remains the object of much controversy and political debate. MƒÅori constitutional lawyer Moana Jackson has stated that, because the New Zealand Government (identified as \\"Kawanatanga\\" in the Treaty text) is the body politic enforcing the Treaty and making settlements, \\"Kawanatanga\\" is the actual party to the Treaty, not the Crown.Republicanism in New Zealand, Dunmore Press, 1996: page 119 See also * Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi * List of English words of MƒÅori origin References Constitution of New Zealand MƒÅori politics Treaty of Waitangi MƒÅori words and phrases mi:KƒÅwanatanga ","title":"KƒÅwanatanga"},{"id":"249295","text":"The North Atlantic is the portion of the Atlantic Ocean which lies north of the Equator.

Zhu means \\"swine\\" and Bajie means \\"eight precepts\\". Buddhist scholars consider that both expressions are related to \\"≈öƒ´la pƒÅramitƒÅ\\". In many English versions of the story, Zhu Bajie is called \\"Pigsy\\" or \\"Pig\\". Zhu Bajie is a complex and developed character in the novel. He looks like a terrible monster, part human and part pig, who often gets himself and his companions into trouble through his laziness, gluttony, and propensity for lusting after pretty women. He is jealous of Sun Wukong and always tries to bring him down. His Buddhist name \\"Zhu Wuneng\\", given by Bodhisattva Guanyin, means \\"pig (reincarnated) who is aware of ability\\" or \\"pig who rises to power\\", a reference to the fact that he values himself so much as to forget his own grisly appearance. Tang Sanzang gave him the nickname BƒÅji√® which means \\"eight restraints\\" or \\"eight commandments\\" to remind him of his Buddhist diet. In the original Chinese novel, he is often called dƒÅizi (ÂëÜÂ≠ê), meaning \\"idiot\\". Sun Wukong, Tang Sanzang, and even the author consistently refers to him as \\"the idiot\\" over the course of the story. Bodhisattvas and other heavenly beings usually refer to him as \\"Heavenly Tumbleweed\\", his former name when he was a heavenly marshal. Character Zhu Bajie originally held the title of TiƒÅnp√©ng Yu√°nshu√†i (Â§©Ëì¨ÂÖÉÂ∏Ö; lit. \\"Marshal Canopy\\"), commander-in-chief of 80,000 Heavenly Navy Soldiers. However, he was later banished for misbehavior. At a party organized for all the significant figures in Heaven, Bajie saw the goddess of the Moon for the first time and was captivated by her beauty. Following a drunken attempt to seduce her, she reported this to the Jade Emperor and thus he was banished to Earth. In popular retellings, Zhu Bajie was sentenced to a thousand lives where each life would end in a love tragedy. In some retellings of the story, his banishment is linked to Sun Wukong's downfall. In any case, he was exiled from Heaven and sent to be reincarnated on Earth, where by mishap he fell into a pig well and was reborn as a man-eating pig-monster known as Zh≈´ GƒÅngli√® (Áå™ÂàöÈ¨õ the \\"strong-maned pig\\"). In the earlier portions of Journey to the West, Wukong and Tang Sanzang come to Gao village and find that a daughter of the village elder had been kidnapped and the abductor left a note demanding marriage. In some versions of the story Bajie has convinced the elder to allow him to marry the daughter based on his ability to do large amounts of hard work due to his prodigious strength. The elder recants when he discovers that, although Zhu Bajie manages to do quite a lot of work in the fields, he manages to eat so much that the farm is losing money anyway. After some investigations, Wukong found out that Bajie was the \\"villain\\" behind this. He fought with Wukong, who learns after beating him that he has also been recruited by Guanyin to join their pilgrimage and make atonements for his past sins. At the end of the novel, most of Bajie's fellow pilgrims achieve enlightenment and become arhats, but he does not; although much improved, he is still too much a creature of his base desires. He is instead rewarded for his part in the pilgrimage's success with a job as \\"Cleanser of the Altars\\" () and all the leftovers he can eat. However, his actual rank in relation to the others is unclear, but possibly the lowest. Pre-existence In traditional Chinese Taoism, there is a divine goddess named Doumu Yuanjun (ÊñóÂßÜÂÖÉÂêõ) who was acclaimed as the mother of all the constellations, even the Emperor Zi-Wei is her son. She has four faces while one of them is akin to a pig's face. TiƒÅnp√©ng Yu√°nshu√†i (Â§©Ëì¨ÂÖÉÂ∏Ö; lit. \\"Marshal Heavenly Mugwort\\") is one of her most significant understrappers, which is the head general of the North Pole.Von Glahn, Richard. The Sinister Way: The Divine and the Demonic in Chinese Religious Culture. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004, p. 121 Â§©ÁØ∑ÂÖÉÂ∏• (Tian Peng Yuan Shuai) According to the depiction in the chapter 217 of „ÄäÈÅìÊ≥ï‰ºöÂÖÉ„Äã, a biography of Taoism and Chinese mythical stories compiled in Ming Dynasty; TiƒÅnp√©ng Yu√°nshu√†i was a blazing powerful marshal in the North Pole. A phrase depicts his appearance as: He was scarily imposing with three heads and six arms, red hair, red armor all over; Holding a magic seal, an axe, a firm rope in left hands and a convulsion bell, a symbolic artifact of constellations and a long sword in right. He leads 360,000 warriors; travels along with scary and dark gas, in which there is a five-colored cloud. Numerous deities with great respect always greet his arrivals. Under his reign, there are a mass of strong myrmidons, with a piece of description withdrawn from ancient books and records of Taoism, three of the most outstanding ones are: # \\"Mahatma of heaven\\": with height of over a hundred feet, wearing a light-colored gown, disheveled long hair, could create incantatory power with his fingers, holding a sharp sword in his right hand. # \\"The Great General of mixed pneuma\\": Wearing a high crest and golden corselet the whole body, equipped by a bow, an arrow, and a halberd. # \\"Four-eyed thunder marshal\\": Aged, with four eyes and a walks with a crutch. Accompanied by two august emissaries. Also, there are 36 generals and a group of Divine warriors under his dominion; anyhow, as is depicted in myth of Chinese Taoism, he is the commander of a huge deity system in the Northern Pole, in which a great number of valiant deity generals and warriors who all controlled by the Emperor Zi-Wei. The golden statues at the Rua Yai City Pillar Shrine in Suphan Buri, Thailand In the novel, after he is punished and becomes Zhu Bajie, there is an obvious recession in both his confidence and power which makes him less militant and lazier as we can find in many parts in the original passage. However, with the remains of power he used to have in his preexistence, he is still capable of fighting against most of the devils appear in their way of journey and in this regard, Sun Wukong always prefers to bring him together when having battles with enemies although they have intermittent personal conflicts all the way. Nine-toothed rake The nine-toothed rake (Traditional ) is the primary weapon of Zhu Bajie. This phrase depicts the first point in which Bajie's legendary nine-toothed rake had been used: > The fierce and murderous ogre; > Huian, imposing and able. > The iron staff could pulverize the heart; > The rake struck at the face. > The dust thrown up darkened Heaven and Earth; > The flying sand and stones startled gods and ghouls. > The nine‚àítoothed rake > Gleamed and flashed > As its pair of rings resounded; > The lone staff > Was ominously black > As it whirled in its owner's hands. > One was the heir of a Heavenly King, > One defended the Law on Potaraka Island. > The other was an evil fiend in a mountain cave. > In their battle for mastery, > None knew who the winner would be. In another passage, Pig tells of his legendary rake while battling against Sun Wukong: > This was refined from divine ice‚àíiron, > Polished till it gleamed dazzling white, > Hammered by Lord Lao Zi himself, > While Ying Huo fed the fire with coal‚àídust. > The Five Emperors of the Five Regions applied their minds to it, > The Six Dings and Six jias went to great efforts. > They made nine teeth of jade, > Cast a pair of golden rings to hang beneath them, > Decorated the body with the Six Bright Shiners and the Five planets, > Designed it in accordance with the Four Seasons and the Eight Divisions. > The length of top and bottom match Heaven and Earth. > Positive and Negative were to left and right, dividing the sun and moon. > The Six Divine Generals of the Oracular Lines are there, following the > Heavenly Code; > The constellations of the Eight Trigrams are set out in order. > It was named the Supremely Precious Gold‚àíimbued Rake, > And served to guard the gates of the Jade Emperor's palace. > As I had become a great Immortal, > I now enjoyed eternal life, > And was commissioned as Marshal Tian Peng, With this rake to mark my > imperial office. > When I raise it, fire and light stream forth; > When I lower it, a snowy blizzard blows. > It terrifies the Heavenly Generals, > And makes the King of Hell too quake with fear. > There is no other weapon matching it on Earth, > Nor iron to rival it throughout the world. > It changes into anything I like, > And leaps about whenever I say the spell. > For many a year I've carried it around, > Keeping it with me every single day. > I will not put it down even to eat, > Nor do I when I sleep at night. > I took it with me to the Peach Banquet, > And carried it into the celestial court. > When I sinned my sin in drunken pride, > I used it to force compliance with my evil will. > When Heaven sent me down to the mortal dust, > I committed all kinds of wickedness down here. > I used to devour people in this cave, > Until I fell in love and married in Gao Village. > This rake has plunged beneath the sea to stir up dragons, > And climbed high mountains to smash up tigers' dens. > No other blade is worth a mention > Besides my rake, the sharpest weapon ever. > To win a fight with it requires no effort; Of course it always brings me > glory. > Even if you have an iron brain in a brazen head and a body of steel, > This rake will scatter your souls and send your spirit flying. Ë±¨ÂÖ´ÊàíÊñ¨Â¶ñ During their journey, he atrociously kills many demons with his rake, usually with nine blood-spurting holes in their head. Personality =Merits= Respectful Despite his previous identity as a great marshal who was in charge of 80,000 celestial marines, he always claims Sun Wukong as \\"brother\\" with awe and respect while Sun has conflicts with him and often makes fun of him all the way. Of course, another reason for it is he already knows Sun's reputation of being a great fighter in his preexistence. Soft-hearted During the journey, many demons change their appearances into children and beautiful women, pretending to be in trouble to confuse them with the intention of eating their master Tang Sanzang. However, though Sun Wukong is capable of detecting demons, Zhu Bajie always manages to persuade his brother to release them rather than capturing or killing them, although his kindness often causes trouble and leads to disaster. Optimistic Cartoons of Zhu Bajie & Sha Wujing on the streets of Lianyungang Though he is constantly captured by numerous demons throughout the journey, he still behaves normally; even when he is about to be eaten, he does not seem to be anxious compared to his other two mates. This is also related to his background as a marshal in preexistence; rich experience in coping with various incidents makes his emotions fluctuate less. In some readings of this book, it is said that Zhu Bajie deliberately does not use his real power on the journey as he knows every time Monkey King would come and save them all. Even if not, other deities would come and help them. =Demerits= Gluttony As the proverb goes, eating is the most important thing in daily lives. Zhu Bajie in this regard is the best of the best. For example, in one part of the book, he obtains a watermelon and splits it into four pieces to share with his colleagues equally. When he finds watermelon too delicious after finishing his own slice, he finds excuses to eat each piece one by one until he finishes the whole watermelon. He has a big appetite, which is fairly visible in many parts of the story. Laziness Zhu Bajie is given to laziness. He seemingly never cares about their troubles and works, and always finds excuses to procrastinate their expedition. Every time the four of them arrive in another country, the local people always welcome them with food and accommodation because they come from the Great Tang Empire, which was both culturally and economically influential to all the surrounding areas at that time.Introduction to the Tang Empire Zhu Bajie hence tends to find excuses to persuade his master to stay several more days for better abodes and food due to his greediness. Lust When he was a marshal in heaven, he dallied with Chang'e, which was the reason for his banishment. After his reincarnation he drools everytime he meets beauties. Because of his lust the group often sinks into various troubles and even disasters. All in all, he was given a name that means \\"eight resistances\\", which reminded him to resist temptations of the flesh, including women, laziness, gluttony, and avarice.

They were, however, able to use the legislature as a forum for debating the ruling KMT. Members of the Tangwai movement formed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 1986.

Personal  Born in South Bronx, New York, Mamby, the child of mother, Victoria, of Spanish descent and father, Robert, from Jamaica, converted to Judaism at age 4. He went to Hebrew School at the Bronx's Mount Horeb Synagogue. Mamby became interested in boxing while on vacation in Jamaica. He began his boxing career in 1963 at the age of sixteen, fighting in the Golden Gloves in 1965 and 1966. He compiled an amateur record of 25‚Äì5 before turning pro in 1969. Mamby was a soldier in the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in 1968.The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Blady, Ken, (1988) Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., New York, New York, pp. 298-9  Boxing career  He held the WBC super lightweight title once, starting his -year reign in February 1980 by going to South Korea to stop titlist Kim Sang-Hyun in the 14th round. After that, he made five successful defenses, travelling to Indonesia and Nigeria in the process. He stopped former WBC lightweight champion Esteban De Jes√∫s in the 13th round in July 1980 on the Holmes-LeDoux undercard and decisioned Termite Watkins over 15 on the Holmes-Ali undercard. He won a 15-round nod over Jo Kimpuani on yet another undercard for a Larry Holmes fight against Leon Spinks. He then went to Indonesia to decision Thomas Americo. In his last bout leaving the ring as champion, he decisioned Obisia Nwankpa in Nigeria. He was to fight WBA champion Aaron Pryor in the summer of 1982 for a unification bout in the super lightweight division, but instead fought and lost his WBC title by split decision to Leroy Haley in June of that year. He would play the role of world title challenger twice more, once in a rematch with Haley in February 1983 which he lost in a 12-round unanimous decision. He then challenged new champion Billy Costello in November 1984 but lost another 12-round unanimous decision. Other boxers Mamby fought include Roberto Dur√°n to whom he lost by points in a non-title fight in 1976, and Saengsak Muangsurin to whom he lost in a 15-round decision in Thailand in 1977 in an attempt to win Muangsurin's WBC title. Mamby continued to fight into his 50s, and was forced to retire by the California State athletic commission following his last loss in 2000. = Comeback at 60 = At the age of 60, Mamby announced a comeback which was to have taken place in Lapwai, Idaho at the Pi-Nee-Waus Community Center of the Nez Perce Tribe, in a card that was subsequently canceled. Mamby fought several weeks later, weighing 149 pounds (67 kilograms) and lost a ten-round decision to journeyman fighter Anthony Osbourne in the Cayman Islands. As a result, Mamby became one of the oldest boxers to appear in an officially sanctioned bout. It was Mamby's eleventh loss in his last 14 fights. Mamby was known for his ability to take punches well; in 85 professional bouts, he was stopped only once, that by an opponent who was several years younger, Derell Coley, in 1993.http://boxrec.com/boxer/3472  See also  * List of WBC world champions *List of select Jewish boxers  References   External links  * 1947 births 2019 deaths Boxers from New York (state) Military personnel from New York City Converts to Judaism African-American Jews Jewish American boxers Jewish boxers Light-welterweight boxers Welterweight boxers World light-welterweight boxing champions World Boxing Council champions Sportspeople from the Bronx American army personnel of the Vietnam War American people of Spanish descent American people of Jamaican descent American male boxers United States Army soldiers Jewish American military personnel ","title":"Saoul Mamby"},{"id":"249306","text":"Sorcerer may refer to: Magic * Sorcerer (paranormal), a practitioner of magic, the ability to attain objectives or acquire knowledge or wisdom using supernatural means * Sorcerer (fantasy), someone who uses or practices magic that derives from supernatural or occult sources Film * The Sorceror (film), a 1932 German film * The Sorcerers, a 1967 British science fiction/horror film * Sorcerer (film), a 1977 jungle adventure film * Highlander III: The Sorcerer, a 1994 U.S. fantasy action film Games * Sorcerer (board game), a 1975 board wargame * Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons), a character class in the game Dungeons & Dragons * Sorcerer (role-playing game), a 2002 tabletop role playing game made by Ron Edwards * Sorcerer (video game), a 1984 interactive fiction computer game made by Infocom Music * Sorcerer (band), a Swedish epic doom band from Stockholm * Sorcerer (Miles Davis album), 1967 * Sorcerer (soundtrack), performed by Tangerine Dream for the film of the same name * \\"Sorcerer\\" (Stevie Nicks song), a 1984 song * The Sorcerer, an 1877 comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan * The Sorcerer (album), a 1967 album by G√°bor Szab√≥ * \\"The Sorcerer\\", a song by Herbie Hancock from his album Speak Like a Child Animals * Sorcerer (horse) (1796‚Äì1821), British Thoroughbred racehorse * Sorcerer (moth), of the family Noctuidae Computing * Sorcerer (Linux distribution), Linux distribution * Exidy Sorcerer, a home computer system released in 1978 Other uses * The Sorcerer (cave art), cave painting in 'The Sanctuary' cavern, Ari√®ge, France * The Dark Tower: The Sorcerer, a comic book * The Sorceror, a 2002 fantasy novel by Troy Denning See also * Sourceror (disambiguation) * Sorceress (disambiguation) * Sorcery (disambiguation) * Magician (disambiguation) * Warlock (disambiguation) * Wizard (disambiguation) * Witch (disambiguation) ","title":"Sorcerer"},{"id":"249313","text":"Lysimachus (Greek: ŒõœÖœÉŒØŒºŒ±œáŒøœÇ, Lysimachos; c. 360 BC ‚Äì 281 BC) was a Macedonian officer and diadochus (i.e. \\"successor\\") of Alexander the Great, who became a basileus (\\"King\\") in 306 BC, ruling Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon. Early life and career Lysimachus was born in circa 360 BC, to a family of Thessalian Greek stock. He was the second son of AgathoclesLund, Lysimachus: A Study in Early Hellenistic Kingship, p. 3 and his wife; there is some indication in the historical sources that this wife was perhaps named Arsinoe, and that Lysimachus' paternal grandfather may have been called Alcimachus. His father was a nobleman of high rank who was an intimate friend of Philip II of Macedon, who shared in Philip II‚Äôs councils and became a favourite in the Argead court.Lund, Lysimachus: A Study in Early Hellenistic Kingship, p.2 Lysimachus and his brothers grew up with the status of Macedonians; all these brothers enjoyed with Lysimachus prominent positions in Alexander‚Äôs circle and, like him, were educated at the Macedonian court in Pella.Heckel, Who‚Äôs who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander‚Äôs empire, p. 153Lysimachus had an elder brother called Alcimachus of Apollonia and had two younger brothers called Autodicus and Philip. He had two known nephews through his brother Alcimachus called Alcimachus and Philip; his known great-nephew was Lysippus the grandson of his brother Alcimachus and his known sister-in- law was Adeia the wife of Autodicus The historian Justin relates the story that Lysimachus smuggled poison to a person Alexander had condemned to a slow death and was himself thrown to a lion as punishment, but overcame the beast with his bare hands and became one of Alexander's favorites.http://www.attalus.org/translate/justin1.html#15.1 Justin, Epitome of Pompey Trogue‚Äôs ‚ÄúPhilippic histories‚Äù, XV, 3, 1‚Äì9: Retrieved 18 January 2019 Pausanias writes that Lysimachus was one of Alexander's body-guards, whom Alexander once in anger shut up in a chamber with a lion but he won the lion and after that Alexander treated him with respect, and honored him as much as the noblest Macedonians.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 1.9.5 Some coins issued during Lysimachus's appointment had his image on one side and a lion on the other. He was probably appointed Somatophylax during the reign of Philip II. During Alexander's Persian campaigns, in 328 BC he was one of his immediate bodyguards. In 324 BC, in Susa, he was crowned in recognition for his actions in India.Heckel, Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great: Prosopography of Alexander's Empire pp. 153-154. \\"Near Sangala in India some 1,200 of Alexander's troops were wounded, among them Lysimachus the Somatophylax. He had earlier boarded a thirty-oared vessel at the Hydaspes (in the company of two other Somatophylakes), before the battle with Porus, though his role in the actual battle is not attested; presumably he fought in the immediate vicinity of Alexander himself. When Alexander decided to sail down the Indus river system to the Ocean, Lysimachus was one of those from Pella charged with a trierarchy in the Attic fashion. He is named by Arrian in the only complete list of Somatophylakes. At Susa in spring 324 BC, Lysimachus and the rest of the Somatophylakes were crowned by Alexander, though unlike Leonnatus, Lysimachus appears to have earned no special distinction.\\" After Alexander's death in 323 BC, he was appointed to the government of Thrace as strategosHeckel, Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great: Prosopography of Alexander's Empire p. 155.\\" In 323 Lysimachus was assigned control of Thrace, and was probably strategos rather than satrap. The subordinate position of strategos may account for the failure of the sources to mention Lysimachus in the settlement of Triparadeisus; his brother Autodicus was, however, named as a Somatophylax of Philip III at that time.\\" although he faced some difficulties from the Thracian king Seuthes. Diadochi Obverse of coin of Lysimachus: The horned Alexander appears as the king's divine patron. In 315 BC, Lysimachus joined Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus against Antigonus, who, however, diverted his attention by stirring up Thracian and Scythian tribes against him. However, he managed to consolidate his power in the east of his territories, suppressing a revolt of the cities on the Black Sea coast. In 309 BC, he founded Lysimachia in a commanding situation on the neck connecting the Chersonese with the mainland, forming a bulwark against the Odrysians. In 306/305 BC, Lysimachus followed the example of Antigonus and assumed the royal title.Heckel, Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great: Prosopography of Alexander's Empire, p. 155. \\"In 306 or 305 BC, he assumed the title of \\"King\\", which he held until his death at Corupedium in 282/1 BC.\\" In 302 BC, when the second alliance between Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus was made, Lysimachus, reinforced by troops from Cassander, entered Asia Minor, where he met with little resistance. On the approach of Antigonus he retired into winter quarters near Heraclea, marrying its widowed queen Amastris, a Persian princess. Seleucus joined him in 301 BC, and at the Battle of Ipsus Antigonus was defeated and slain. Antigonus' dominions were divided among the victors. Lysimachus' share was Lydia, Ionia, Phrygia and the north coast of Asia Minor.Williams, Henry Smith. Historians History of the World (Volume 4), p. 450. thumbright300px Other diadochi Other Feeling that Seleucus was becoming dangerously powerful, Lysimachus now allied himself with Ptolemy, marrying his daughter Arsinoe II of Egypt. Amastris, who had divorced herself from him, returned to Heraclea. When Antigonus' son Demetrius I renewed hostilities (297 BC), during his absence in Greece, Lysimachus seized his towns in Asia Minor, but in 294 BC concluded a peace whereby Demetrius was recognized as ruler of Macedonia. He tried to carry his power beyond the Danube, but was defeated and taken prisoner by the Getae king Dromichaetes (or Dromihete), who, however, set him free in 292 BC on amicable terms in return for Lysimachus surrendering the Danubian lands he had captured. Demetrius subsequently threatened Thrace, but had to retire due to a sudden uprising in Boeotia and an attack from King Pyrrhus of Epirus. In 287 BC, Lysimachus and Pyrrhus in turn invaded Macedonia and drove Demetrius out of the country. Lysimachus left Pyrrhus in possession of Macedonia with the title of king for around seven months before Lysimachus invaded. For a short while the two ruled jointly but in 285 BC Lysimachus expelled Pyrrhus, seizing complete control for himself.Williams, Henry Smith. Historians History of the World (Volume 4), p. 454.

Later years Domestic troubles embittered the last years of Lysimachus‚Äô life. Amastris had been murdered by her two sons; Lysimachus treacherously put them to death. On his return, Arsinoe II asked the gift of Heraclea, and he granted her request, though he had promised to free the city. In 284 BC Arsinoe, desirous of gaining the succession for her sons in preference to Lysimachus‚Äô first child, Agathocles, intrigued against him with the help of Arsinoe's paternal half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos; they accused him of conspiring with Seleucus to seize the throne, and Agathocles was put to death. This atrocious deed by Lysimachus aroused great indignation. Many of the cities of Asia Minor revolted, and his most trusted friends deserted him. The widow of Agathocles and their children fled to Seleucus, who at once invaded the territory of Lysimachus in Asia Minor. In 281 BC, Lysimachus crossed the Hellespont into Lydia and at the decisive Battle of Corupedium was killed. After some days his body was found on the field, protected from birds of prey by his faithful dog.Williams, Henry Smith. Historians History of the World (Volume 4), p. 505. Lysimachus' body was given over to another son, Alexander, by whom it was interred at Lysimachia.

A golden wreath and ring from the burial of an Odrysian Aristocrat at the Golyamata Mogila in the Yambol region of Bulgaria. Mid 4th century BC. A wreath () is an assortment of flowers, leaves, fruits, twigs, or various materials that is constructed to form a ring. In English-speaking countries, wreaths are used typically as household ornaments, most commonly as an Advent and Christmas decoration. They are also used in ceremonial events in many cultures around the globe. They can be worn as a chaplet around the head, or as a garland around the neck. Wreaths have much history and symbolism associated with them. They are usually made from evergreens and symbolize strength, as evergreens last even throughout the harshest winters. Bay laurel may also be used; bay laurel wreaths are known as laurel wreaths.  Etymology  The word wreath comes from Middle English wrethe and from Old English writha, band.  History  = Ancient Etruscan wreaths = Wreath with ivy leaves and berries, a satyr's head at either end. Gold sheet, Etruscan artwork, 400‚Äì350 BC. From a tomb near Tarquinia. Wreaths were a design used in ancient times in southern Europe. The most well-known are pieces of Etruscan civilization jewelry, made of gold or other precious metals. Symbols from Greek myths often appear in the designs, embossed in precious metal at the ends of the wreath. Ancient Roman writers referred to Etruscan corona sutilis, which were wreaths with their leaves sewn onto a background. These wreaths resemble a diadem, with thin metal leaves being attached to an ornamental band. Wreaths also appear stamped into Etruscan medallions. The plants shown making the wreaths in Etruscan jewelry include ivy, oak, olive leaves, myrtle, laurel, wheat and vines. Wreaths were worn as crowns by Etruscan rulers. The Etruscan symbolism continued to be used in Ancient Greece and Rome. Roman magistrates also wore golden wreaths as crowns, as a symbolic testament to their lineage back to Rome's early Etruscan rulers. Roman magistrates also used several other prominent Etruscan symbols in addition to a golden wreath crown: fasces, a curule chair, a purple toga, and an ivory rod. = Ancient Greece and Rome = A replica bust of Apollo wearing a laurel wreath. In the Greco-Roman world, wreaths were used as an adornment that could represent a person‚Äôs occupation, rank, their achievements and status. The wreath that was commonly used was the laurel wreath. The use of this wreath comes from the Greek myth involving Apollo, Zeus‚Äô son and the god of life and light, who fell in love with the nymph Daphne. When he pursued her she fled and asked the river god Peneus to help her. Peneus turned her into a laurel tree. From that day, Apollo wore a wreath of laurel on his head. Laurel wreaths became associated with what Apollo embodied; victory, achievement and status and would later become one of the most commonly used symbols to address achievement throughout Greece and Rome. Laurel wreaths were used to crown victorious athletes at the original Olympic Games and are still worn in Italy by university students who just graduated. Other types of plants used to make wreath crowns also had symbolic meaning. For example, oak leaves symbolized wisdom, and were associated with Zeus, who according to Greek mythology made his decisions while resting in an oak grove. The Twelve Tables, dating to 450 BC, refer to funeral wreaths as a long-standing tradition. Olive wreath was the prize for the winner at the ancient Olympic Games.ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒØ ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩŒµœÇ: ŒüŒπ œÑŒπŒºŒ≠œÇ œÉœÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫ŒµœÇ.  Modern wreaths  = Harvest wreath = A Scandinavian-style harvest wreath made of woven straw. Harvest wreaths, a common household decoration today, are a custom with ancient roots in Europe. The creation of harvest wreaths in Europe can be traced back to ancient times, and is associated with animistic spiritual beliefs. In Ancient Greece, the harvest wreath was a sacred amulet, using wheat or other harvested plants, woven together with red and white wool thread. The harvest wreath would be hung by the door year-round. Harvest wreaths were an important symbol to the community in Ancient Greece, not merely to the farmer and his family. The festivals devoted to Dionysus, the Oschophoria and Anthesteria, included a ritual procession called the eires√Æon√™. A harvest wreath was carried to Pyanopsia and Thargelia by young boys, who would sing during the journey. The laurel or olive wreath would be hung at the door, and then offerings were made to Helios and the Hours. It was hoped that this ritual would bring protection against crop failure and plagues. In Poland, the harvest wreath (wieniec) is a central symbol of the Harvest Festival, Dozynki. Wreaths are made of different shapes and sizes, using harvested grain plants, fruit and nuts. The wreath is then brought to a church for a blessing by a priest. The tradition includes a procession to the family home from the church, with a girl or young woman leading the procession and carrying the wreath. The procession is followed with a celebration and feast. Ukraine, Hungary, and other Eastern Europe cultures also have similar rituals that began as part of pre-Christian culture. = Advent and Christmas wreaths = In Christianity, wreaths are used to observe the Advent season, in preparation for Christmastide and Epiphanytide, as well as to celebrate the latter two liturgical seasons.\\"Advent\\", Harper's Magazine (New York: Harper and Brothers Publishing, 1896) p. 776 These wreaths, as with other Advent and Christmas decorations, are often set up on the first Sunday of Advent, a custom that is sometimes done liturgically, through a hanging of the greens ceremony. The Advent wreath was first used by Lutherans in Germany in the 16th century, and in 1839, Lutheran priest Johann Hinrich Wichern used a wreath made from a cart wheel to educate children about the meaning and purpose of Christmas, as well as to help them count its approach, thus giving rise to the modern version of the Advent wreath. For every Sunday of Advent, starting with the fourth Sunday before Christmas, he would put a white candle in the wreath and for every day in between he would use a red candle. The use of the Advent wreath has since spread from the Lutheran Church to many Christian denominations, and some of these traditions, such as the Catholic Church and Moravian Church, have introduced unique variations to it. All of the Advent wreaths, however, have four candles, and many of them have a white candle in the centre, the Christ candle, which is lit on Christmas Day. Advent and Christmas wreaths are constructed of evergreens to represent everlasting life brought through Jesus and the circular shape of the wreath represents God, with no beginning and no end. Advent and Christmas wreaths are now a popular symbol in preparation for and to celebrate the coming of Christ, with the former being used to mark the beginning of the Christian Church‚Äôs liturgical year and both serving as d√©cor during Advent and Christmas festivities. While Advent wreaths are erected on stands or placed on tables, Christmas wreaths are often hung on doors or walls. Within Advent, the Church observes Saint Lucy's Day, the memorial of Saint Lucy, who is said to have brought \\"food and aid to Christians hiding in the catacombs\\" using a candle-lit wreath to \\"light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible\\"; as such, on this day, many young Christian girls dress as Saint Lucy, wearing a wreath on their head. = Funeral and memorial wreaths = A sculpted wreath on the South African War Memorial, Richmond Cemetery Wreaths laid at war memorials in Australia Wreaths are mounted on frames near the Moscow grave of Russian intellectual Andrei Sakharov, 1990 The symbolism of wreaths has been used at funerals since at least the time of Ancient Greece, to represent a circle of eternal life. Evergreen wreaths were laid at the burial place of early Christian virgin martyrs in Europe, the evergreen representing the victory of the eternal spirit over death. In early modern England, a wreath custom existed for the funerals of \\"young maidens\\". A young woman of the same age as the one being mourned would lead the funeral procession, carrying a wreath of white flowers to represent the purity of the deceased, and \\"that eternal crown of glory reserved for her in heaven\\". By the Victorian era, the symbolism of flowers had grown to become an elaborate language, and the symbolism of funeral wreaths was no exception. Flowers represented life and resurrection. Specific flowers were used in funeral wreaths to represent particular sentiments. Cypress and willow were used for crafting wreath frames, and were associated with mourning by the Victorians. Wreaths are commonly laid at the tombs of soldiers and at memorial cenotaphs during Memorial Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies. Wreaths may also be laid in memory of persons lost at sea, either from an accident or due to navy action. In a memorial service at sea, the wreath is lowered to the water and set adrift.  Wreaths worn as crowns  A wreath may be used as a headdress made from leaves, flowers and branches. It is typically worn in festive occasions and on holy days. Wreaths originally were made for use with pagan rituals in Europe, and were associated with the changing seasons and fertility. Christianity accepted the symbolism of the wreath based upon its Roman association with honour and moral virtue. During the Middle Ages, Christian art featured depictions of the Virgin Mary and various saints crowned with wreaths, much as figures from Roman and Greek mythology were depicted wearing wreaths, as well as Roman and Greek rulers and heroes. = Maypole wreath = A Maypole with wreaths, raised for Midsummer celebrations in √ñstra Insj√∂, Dalarna, Sweden Wreath customs in Europe have survived over many centuries. The observance of May Day in England includes Maypole festivities, culminating in a race by young unmarried men to climb to the top of the Maypole to capture the May Day wreath perched at the top of the pole. The winner of this contest would wear the wreath as his crown, and would be recognized as the May Day King for the rest of the holiday. Plants traditionally used to make Midsummer wreaths and garlands include white lilies, green birch, fennel, St. John's Wort, wormwood, vervain and flax. The flowers used in making the Midsummer wreath had to be picked early in the morning before the dew had dried; the belief was that once the dew dried, the magical properties of the plants evaporated with the dew. Midsummer celebrations are still observed in Germany and Scandinavia as well, with Maypoles and wreaths playing a prominent role, similar to England. = Wreath symbolism in England = By the Renaissance period, wreaths became symbols of political and religious alliances in England. Protestant reformers such as the Puritans saw wreaths and the holidays they were associated with, such as May Day, as being pagan corrupting influences that destroyed healthy Christian morality. Soldiers confiscated wreaths in Oxford on May Day of 1648. During the Interregnum following the overthrow of Charles I of England, wreaths symbolized Royalist sympathies. In Bath, Somerset, the coronation of Charles II of England was marked with a procession of 400 maidens in white and green, carrying \\"gilded crowns, crowns made of flowers, and wreaths made of laurel mixed with tulips\\", and led by the mayor's wife. Wreath thrown in water on Ivan Kupala Day Feast of St. John the Baptist, in Russia = Saint Lucy's Day crown = Saint Lucy is traditionally depicted in Christian artwork wearing a wreath as a crown, and on the wreath stand lit candles symbolizing the light of the world represented by Christ. Sweden in particular has a long history of observing Saint Lucy's Day (St. Lucia's Day). \\"St. Lucia's crowns\\", made of a brass wreath holding candles, are part of the customs associated with this holiday. Wreath laying ceremonies Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow, May 2008 Group of wreaths laid during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony in London A wreath laying ceremony is a traditional practice during which funeral wreaths are laid at a grave or memorial site. It is done as a formal sign of respect towards a particular tribute (e.g. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, National Memorial). These are formal ceremonies that involve high ranking dignitaries such as heads of state. Once a wreath is laid, the person who lays the wreath goes a few steps back to bow/salute the memorial. During wreath laying ceremonies of a military nature, bugle calls such as \\"Last Post\\", \\"Taps\\", or \\"Sunset\\" are played.https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Visit/Events- and-Ceremonies/Ceremonies-and-Traditions/Wreath-Layings In the Netherlands, wreath laying () is usually held during the National Remembrance Day celebrations on 4 May. During state visits, a wreath is laid out at the National Monument in Amsterdam. In Russia, it is tradition to lay wreaths at war memorials on Days of Military Honour and commemorative military holidays, such as Defender of the Fatherland Day and Victory Day. One of the more notable laying of wreaths takes place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow's Alexander Garden, where the President of Russia, the Prime Minister of Russia, members of the Federal Assembly, military officers, religious leaders in the Russian Orthodox Church and other dignitaries are led to lay a funeral wreath close to the eternal flame. A moment of silence is then conducted, which is usually followed by a solemn march of an honour guard passes. In the United Kingdom, wreaths, are most notably laid at the Cenotaph during the National Service of Remembrance on Remembrance Day.

Besides public spending (by governments and other public bodies), private spending via tuition payments are the largest revenue sources for education institutions in some countries. In most developed countries, especially countries in Scandinavia and Continental Europe, there are no or only nominal tuition fees for all forms of education, including university and other higher education.Garritzmann, Julian L., 2016. The Political Economy of Higher Education Finance. The Politics of Tuition Fees and Subsidies in OECD countries, 1945-2015. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.  Payment methods  Some of the methods used to pay for tuition include: * Scholarship * Bursary * Company sponsorship or funding * Grant * Government student loan * Educational 7 (private) * Family (parental) money * Savings  By location  Countries such as South Africa, the United States and the United Kingdom have \\"up-front tuition policies.\\"Marcucci, Pamela N. and D. Bruce Johnstone, \\"Tuition Fee Policies in a Comparative Perspective: Theoretical and Political Rationales\\", Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, Volume 29, Number 1 (2007), pp. 25-40. (Taylor & Francis Online, retrieved 13 March 2012) These policies generally include a tuition fee that is large enough to give parents or guardians \\"a responsibility to cover some portion of their children‚Äôs higher education costs.\\" This responsibility can make it difficult for a low-income student to attend college without requiring a grant or one or more loans. College tuition in the United States is one of the costs of a post-secondary education. The total cost of college is called the cost of attendance (or, informally, the \\"sticker price\\") and, in addition to tuition, can include room and board and fees for facilities such as books, transportation, or commuting provided by the college. In Europe the first cycle is free in several countries: Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey. In Hungary the annual tuition at a public university may exceed 15,000 euros. Only 32 percent of the students pay tuition that averages 1,428 euros for a year at a 1st-degree level and 1,552 for a year at the 2nd-degree level. It is important to note that a student in Hungary has an opportunity to receive a scholarship of up to 3,000 euros for living expenses and nearly 4,000 euros for good grades. In Lithuania the highest tuition is nearly 12,000 euros and 37 percent of the students pay. Tuition fees in the United Kingdom were introduced in 1998, with a maximum permitted fee of ¬£1,000. Since then, this maximum has been raised to ¬£9,000 (more than ‚Ç¨10,000) in most of the United Kingdom, however, only those who reach a certain salary fresh hold pay this fee through general taxation. The UK state pays for the poorest or low income to access a university, thus university attendance remains high. There are record levels of disadvantaged people accessing a university. Scotland has abolished tuition. There are no scholarships and the only assistance is a possible loan from the government. French tuition fees are capped based on the level of education pursued, from 183 Euros per year for undergraduate up to 388 for doctorates. Some public universities have autonomous status, meaning that they can charge much higher tuition, and all private universities charge tuition. In the German education system almost all universities and most universities of applied sciences are funded by the state and do not charge tuition fees. In exceptional cases universities may offer courses for professionals (e.g. executive MBA programs), which may require tuition payment. Some local governments have recently decided that students from non-EU countries can be charged, although ERASMUS students, students from developing countries and other special groups are exempt. In addition, some private institutions of higher education run on a tuition-based model. All Nordic countries provide higher education free of charge to their own citizens. The Nordic education systems are almost entirely publicly funded. In Nordic countries education is seen as a civil right and a public service rather than a commodity. The issue of education is seen in these countries as an issue of equality. This is in part because high levels of education are a benefit to the development of society, including business and industry. In Greece there are no tuition fees as Bachelor-level higher education and Master-level post-graduate education is provided for free to all Hellene (Greek) citizens as a benefit of citizenship paid by taxes. However, universities accept very few students who have excelled at high school, with the selection being done through the Panhellenic Examinations, a system of state-administered examinations in which the chance of failure is very high and thus only a small percentage of students is able to pass and there is a limit to the number of students that can be accepted each year. Furthermore, it is difficult for mature students to be accepted at universities. Doctorate- level higher education is often also provided for free, but some universities may charge fees for PhD degrees. Students who are unable to pass the Panhellenic Examinations in a few attempts are effectively banned for life from the Greek university system and those who want a higher education must resort to registering at private universities (called colleges, Œ∫ŒøŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒπŒ±), which charge tuition fees, or emigrate to other countries in order to get an education. Some students who excel academically in school but fail to get a good \\"ethics performance mark\\" are disqualified from entering the Panhellenic Examinations because of non-academic factors, since the Greek educational system also marks the student's \\"ethics performance\\" (Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒÆ, dialogi) rather than only academic performance. An unruly student or a student caught cheating or drinking may receive a disqualifying mark in her \\"ethics performance\\", which can disqualify the student from entering university (or in extreme cases from continuing high school) even if the student has excellent academic skills.  By institution  Tuition is charged at different rates from one type of institution to the next. Net tuition indices mark an increase in the \\"relative real burden\\" for payments at various types of institutions for higher education; in the period between 1980 and 1995; example, this burden increased by approximately 80 percent for students at public universities and by 148 percent for students at private universities.Martin, Robert E., \\"Why Tuition Costs Are Rising So Quickly\\", Challenge, Volume 45, Number 4 (2002), pp. 88-108. (JSTOR, retrieved 13 March 2012) Most students or their families who pay for tuition and other education costs do not have enough savings to pay in full while they are in school.http://news.salliemae.com/files/doc_library/file/HowAmericaPaysforCollege2014FNL.pdf Some students must work or borrow money to afford an education. In the United States, student financial aid is available to defray the cost of a post- secondary education: \\"Financial aid is typically thought to exert the most influence in [attendance], when admitted students consider whether to enroll in a particular institution.\\"DesJardins, Stephen L., \\"Assessing the Effects of Changing Institutional Aid Policy\\", Research in Higher Education, Volume 42, Number 6 (2001), pp. 653-78. (JSTOR, retrieved 13 March 2012) It is often the case that the lower the cost of the school, the more likely a student is to attend. Developed countries have adopted a dual scheme for education; while basic (i.e. high-school) education is supported by taxes rather than tuition, higher education usually requires tuition payments or fees. People may purchase tuition insurance to protect themselves from fees related to involuntary withdrawal (illness, death of a parent or guardian, etc.)  History  Study comparing college revenue per student by tuition and state funding in 2008 dollars.Delta Cost Project, \\"Trends in College Spending 1998-2008 \\". In medieval Europe, universities were mainly institutions of the Catholic Church. As they mainly trained clergy, most of these universities did not have any need to exact fees from the students with one notable exception: during the 12th century, while under the supervision of Pierre le Mangeur, the University of Paris began collecting two sous weekly in tuition. Later, the main duty of universities in most Protestant countries was the training of future civil servants. Again, it was not in the interest of the state to charge tuition fees, as this would have decreased the quality of civil servants. On the other hand, the number of students from the lower classes was usually kept in check by the expenses of living during the years of study, although as early as the mid-19th century there were calls for limiting the university entrance by middle-class persons. A typical family, however, could not afford educating a child or young adult, even if the education itself was free. A similar situation exists today in many Third World countries, where the expenses of \\"free\\" schooling (food, books, school uniform, etc.) prevent some children from attending any school. After World War II the tuition systems of all of today's advanced democracies still were highly similar: Education institutions in all countries charged no or only very low tuition fees. It was not before the 1950s that the countries' education systems developed in different directions. Some countries, especially the Anglo-Saxon countries (for example the United States) but also Asian countries such as Japan, introduced considerable tuition payments already in the early post-war period. Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and continental Europe, in contrast remained tuition-free. These developments were unrelated to the massive educational expansion that took place at the same time. Since the early 1970s, the average cost of tuition has steadily outpaced the growth of the average American household. This trend continued particularly under President Reagan's higher education policies in the 1980s. Likewise, there has been a steady decrease in federal funding for grants and a rise in the interest rates of most major student loans, leaving many students struggling to pay debt for years after graduation. =College tuition for undocumented students= The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate. It would allow the estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented students in the United States to gain in-state tuition as well as a path towards American citizenship. The Act would apply only to those students with tangible proof of residence in the United States before the age of 18. This Act has stirred debate in numerous groups, including institutions, families, and the Senate itself. As of March 2013, undocumented students in most States were required to pay the higher out-of-state students' tuition charged at public universities, often between $20,000 and $35,000 at a local public university. In addition, these students were denied federal assistance as they lacked valid Social Security numbers. Because such students often come from comparatively poor families, the costs are too high to allow many undocumented students to seek university education in the United States.

The most common feature of tales involving Koschei is a spell which prevents him from being killed. He hides his soul inside nested objects to protect it. For example, the soul may be hidden in the needle that is hidden inside the egg which is carried by the duck that flies away whenever anyone tries to catch it. Usually he takes the role of a malevolent rival father figure, who competes for (or entraps) a male hero's love interest. The origin of the tales is unknown. The archetype may contain elements derived from the 12th-century pagan Cuman-Kipchak (Polovtsian) leader Khan Konchak, who is recorded in The Tale of Igor's Campaign; over time a balanced view of the non-Christian Cuman khan may have been distorted or caricatured by Christian Slavic writers. Historicity and folk origins By at least the 18th century, and likely earlier, Koschei's legend had been appearing in Slavic tales. For a long period no connection was made with any historical character. =Origin in Khan Konchak= The origin of the tale may be related to the Polovtsian (Cuman) leader Khan Konchak, who dates from the 12th century.Konchak is an important antagonist in the Tale of Igor's Campaign In The Tale of Igor's Campaign Konchak is referred to as a koshey (slave).In Leonard A. Magnus's translation : \\"Shoot, my liege, the heathen Konctik the slave\\" Konchak is thought to have come/returned from Georgia (the Caucasus) to the steppe c.1126‚Äì1130; by c.1172 he is described in Russian chronicles as a leader of the Polovtsi, and as taking part in an uprising. There is not enough information to reconstruct further details of Konchak's appearance or nature from historical sources; though unusual features or abnormalities were usually recorded (often as epithets) by chroniclers, none are recorded for Konchuk. The legendary miserliness (love of gold) of Koschei is speculated to be a distorted record of Konchak's role as the keeper of the Kosh's resources. Koschei's epithet \\"the immortal\\" may be a reference to Konchak's longevity. He is last recorded in Russian chronicles during the 1203 capture of Kiev, if the record is correct this gives Konchak an unusually long life ‚Äì possibly over 100 years ‚Äì for the time this would have been over six generations. Koschei's life-protecting spell may be derived from traditional Turkic amulets, not only were these oval (egg) shaped, but they would often contain arrowheads (cf. the needle in Koschei's egg). It is thought that many of the negative aspects of Koschei's character are distortions of a more nuanced relationship of Khan Konchak with the Christian Slavs, such as his rescuing of Prince Igor from captivity, or the marriage between Igor's son and Konchak's daughter. Konchak, as a pagan, could have been demonised over time as a stereotypical villain. =Naming and etymology= Numerous variant names and spellings have been given to Koschei ‚Äì these include Kashchei, Koshchai, Kashshei, Kovshei, Kosh, Kashch, Kashel, Kostei, Kostsei, Kashshui, Kozel, Koz'olok, Korachun, Korchun bessmertnyi, Kot bezsmertnyi, Kot Bezmertnyi, Kostii bezdushnyi; in bylinas he also appears as Koshcheiushko, Koshcheg, Koshcherishcho, Koshchui, Koshel. Kachtche√Ø is the standard French transliteration. The term Koshey appears in Slavic chronicles as early as the 12th century to refer to an officer or official during a military campaign. Similar terms include the Ukrainian –ö–æ—à–æ–≤–∏–π (Koshovoy) for the head of the 'Kosh' (military) (see also Kosh otaman.) In Old Russian 'Kosh' means a camp, while in Belarussian a similar term means 'to camp' and in Turkic languages a similar term means 'a wanderer'. The use as a personal name is recorded as early as the 15th century on Novogrodian birch bark manuscripts. In The Tale of Igor's Campaign a similar sounding term is used, recorded being inscribed on coins, deriving from the Turkic for 'captive' or 'slave'. The same term also appears in the Ipatiev Chronicle, meaning 'captive'. A second mention of the term is made in The Tale of Igor's Campaign when Igor is captured by the Polovtsi; this event is recorded as a riddle: \\"And here Prince Igor exchanged his golden saddle of a prince for the saddle of a Koshey (slave).\\" Nikolai Novikov also suggested the etymological origin of koshchii meaning \\"youth\\" or \\"boy\\" or \\"captive\\", \\"slave\\", or \\"servant\\". The interpretation of \\"captive\\" is interesting because Koschei appears initially as a captive in some tales. In folk tales Koschei is a common antihero in east-Slavic folk tales. Often tales involving him are of the type AT 302 'The Giant Without A Heart' (see Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification systems); and he also appears in tales resembling type AT 313 'The Magic Flight'. He usually functions as the antagonist or rival to a hero. Love rivalry and related themes are common. The typical feature of tales concerning Koschei is his protection against being killed (AT 302) ‚Äì to do so he has hidden his soul inside an egg, and further nested the egg inside various animals, and then in protective containers and places. In other tales, Koschei can cast a sleep spell that can be broken by playing an enchanted gusli. Depending on the tale he has different characteristics: he may ride a three- or seven-legged horse; may have tusks or fangs; and may possess a variety of different magic objects (like cloaks and rings) that a hero is sent to obtain; or he may have other magic powers. In one tale he has eyelids so heavy he requires servants to lift them (cf. the Celtic Balor or Ysbaddaden, or Serbian Vy). Psychologically, Koschei can represent an initially benevolent, but later malevolent, father (to a bride) figure. The parallel female figure, Baba Yaga, as a rule does not appear in the same tale with Koschei, though exceptions exists where both appear together as a married couple, or as siblings. Koschey revived by Ivan with water, from Marya Morevna (The Red Fairy Book, 1890) =Marya Morevna= Also known as \\"The Death of Koschei the Deathless\\", Ivan Tsarevitch encounters Koschei chained in his wife's (Marya Morevna's) dungeon. He releases and revives Koschei, but Koschei abducts Marya. Ivan goes to rescue Marya several times, but Koschei's swift horse allows him to easily catch up with the escaping lovers; each time the magical horse informs Koschei that he will be able to carry out several activities first and still be able to catch up. After the third unsuccessful escape, Koschei cuts up Ivan and throws his parts into the sea in a barrel. Ivan is revived with the aid of the water of life. He seeks Baba Yaga for a suitably swift horse. After trials he steals a horse and rescues Marya. =Tsarevich Petr and The Wizard= Tsar Bel-Belianin's wife the Tzaritza is abducted by Koschei (the Wizard). The Tsar's three sons attempt to rescue her. The first two fail to reach the wizard's palace, but the third, Petr, succeeds. He reaches the Tzaritza, conceals himself, and learns how the wizard hides his life. Initially he lies, but the third time he reveals it is in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, that nests in a hollow log, that floats in pond, found in a forest on the island of Bouyan. Petr seeks the egg, freeing animals along the way - on coming to Bouyan the freed animals help him catch the wizard's creatures and obtain the egg. He returns to the wizard's domain and kills him by squeezing the egg - every action on the egg is mirrored on the wizard's body. =The Snake Princess= In 'The Snake Princess' (Russian –¶–∞—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∞-–∑–º–µ—è), Koschei turns a princess who does not want to marry him into a snake. =Ivan Sosnovich= The Koschei hears of three beauties in a kingdom. He kills two and wounds a third, puts the kingdom to sleep (petrifies), and abducts the princesses. Ivan Sosnovich (Russian –ò–≤–∞–Ω –°–æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á) learns of Koschei's weakness: an egg in a box hidden under a mountain, so he digs up the whole mountain, finds the egg box and smashes it, and rescues the princess. He also appears as a miser in Pushkin's Ruslan and Ludmila, though this interpretation does not reflect previous folk tale representations. Related folklore figures The Serbian Ba≈° ƒåelik (Head of Steel); Hungarian 'Lead- Headed Monk'; and Slovak 'Iron Monk' also all hide their weakness inside a series of nested animals.

It is not saut√©ed or otherwise hard cooked, because the intention is to sweeten the ingredients rather than caramelize them. It is a long-standing cooking technique in French cuisine. When the mirepoix is not precooked, the constituent vegetables may be cut to a larger size, depending on the overall cooking time for the dish. Usually the vegetable mixture is onions, carrots, and celery (either common 'pascal' celery or celeriac), with the traditional ratio being 2:1:1, two parts onion, one part carrot, and one part celery. Mirepoix is the flavor base for a wide variety of Western dishes: stocks, soups, stews and sauces. Similar flavor bases include the Italian , the Spanish and Portuguese / (braised onions, garlic and tomato), as well as the Turkish variation with tomato paste instead of fresh tomato of the eastern Mediterranean/Balkan region, the German (leeks, carrots and celeriac), the Polish (leeks, carrots, celery root and parsley root), the Russian/Ukrainian or (onion, carrot and possibly celery, beets or pepper), the United States Cajun/Creole holy trinity (onions, celery and bell peppers), and possibly the French duxelles (mushrooms and often onion or shallot and herbs, reduced to a paste). History Though the cooking technique is probably older, the word mirepoix dates from the 18th century and derives, as do many other appellations in French cuisine, from the aristocratic employer of the cook credited with establishing and stabilizing it: in this case, Charles-Pierre- Gaston Fran√ßois de L√©vis, duc de L√©vis-Mirepoix (1699‚Äì1757), French field marshal and ambassador and a member of the noble family of L√©vis, lords of Mirepoix in Languedoc (nowadays in the department of Ari√®ge) since the 11th century.French Wikipedia: Maison de L√©vis. According to Pierre Larousse (quoted in The Oxford Companion to Food), the unfortunate Duke of Mirepoix was \\"an incompetent and mediocre individual ... who owed his vast fortune to the affection Louis XV felt toward his wife and who had but one claim to fame: he gave his name to a sauce made of all kinds of meat and a variety of seasonings\\". The term is not encountered regularly in French culinary texts until the 19th century, so it is difficult to know what a dish was like in 18th-century France. Antoine Beauvilliers,French cuisine ¬ßFood establishments ¬ßHistory. for instance, in 1814, gives a short recipe for a which is a buttery, wine-laced stock garnished with an aromatic mixture of carrots, onions, and a . Marie-Antoine Car√™me, in 1816, gives a similar recipe, calling it simply \\"Mire-poix\\". By the mid-19th century, Jules Gouff√© refers to mirepoix as \\"a term in use for such a long time that I do not hesitate to use it here\\". His mirepoix is listed among essences and, indeed, is a meaty concoction (laced with two bottles of Madeira), which, like all other essences, was used to enrich many a classic sauce. By the end of the 19th century, the mirepoix had taken on its modern meaning. Joseph Favre, in his Dictionnaire universel de cuisine (circa 1895, reprinted 1978), uses the term to describe a mixture of ham, carrots, onions, and herbs used as an aromatic condiment when making sauces or braising meat.Alan Davidson, Oxford Companion to Food (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 509. The is very similar to the mirepoix, except that the is designed to be brought to the table and eaten with the dish or alone as a side dish. According to the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique, a mirepoix may be prepared (with meat) or ('lean'). Since the 17th century, recipe books in France had been organized so readers could plan meals in accordance with prescribed days for fasting according to the Catholic liturgical calendar. See Sean Takats, The Expert Cook in Enlightenment France (Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press) p. 110. is sometimes called a Larousse Gastronomique, Montagn√©, Prosper, and Gottschalk, eds., introduction by A. Escoffier and Phil√©as Gilbert (Paris: Librerie Larousse, 1938), p. 690. (though strictly speaking this term more accurately merely designates the technique of dicing with a knife). A contains diced ham or pork belly as an additional ingredient. Similar combinations, both in and out of the French culinary repertoire, may include leeks, parsnips, garlic, tomatoes, shallots, mushrooms, bell peppers, chilies, and ginger, according to the requirements of the regional cuisine or the instructions of the particular chef or recipe.The 1938 Larousse (op. cit.) recommends the addition of thyme and powdered bay leaf to the , for example. The analogous (frequently containing parsley) is the basis for many traditional dishes in classic Italian cuisine, and the serves a similar purpose in Spanish cuisines. In Cajun and Creole cuisine, a mirepoix or (jocularly so-called) \\"holy trinity\\" is a combination of onions, celery, and bell peppers. Traditionally, the weight ratio for mirepoix is 2:1:1 of onions, celery, and carrots; the ratio for bones to mirepoix for stock is 10:1. When making a white stock, or , parsnips are used instead of carrots to maintain the pale color. International versions =German = ' means 'soup greens' in German; the Dutch equivalent is . Soup greens usually come in a bundle and consists of a leek, a carrot, and a piece of celeriac. It may also contain parsley, thyme, celery leaves, rutabaga (swede), parsley root, and onions.

Large chunks of vegetables are slow cooked to make flavorful soups and stocks, and are discarded when the vegetables have given up most of their flavor.

A native of Camden, South Carolina and three-sport all-state athlete while in high school in Paterson, New Jersey, Doby accepted a basketball scholarship from Long Island University. At 17 years of age, he began his professional baseball career with the Newark Eagles as the team's second baseman. Doby joined the United States Navy during World War II. His military service complete, Doby returned to baseball in 1946, and along with teammate Monte Irvin, helped the Eagles win the Negro League World Series. In July 1947‚Äîthree months after Jackie Robinson made history with the Brooklyn Dodgers‚ÄîDoby broke the MLB color barrier in the American League when he signed a contract to play with Bill Veeck's Cleveland Indians. Doby was the first player to go directly to the majors from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians took the crown in 1948. He helped the Indians win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954, finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting and was the AL's RBI leader and home run champion. He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player in 1962. Doby later served as the second black manager in the majors with the Chicago White Sox, and in 1995 was appointed to a position in the AL's executive office. He also served as a director with the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 by the Hall's Veterans Committee and died in 2003 at the age of 79. Early life Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina, to David Doby and Etta Brooks. Doby's father served in World War I. He worked as a horse groomer and played semi-pro baseball, but drowned in an accident at age 37 in New York state. Doby's mother, who had divorced David before his death, moved to Paterson, New Jersey; Doby remained in Camden. He lived with his grandmother before moving to live with his father's sister and brother-in-law from 1934 to 1938. He attended Jackson School, which was segregated under South Carolina state law. His first opportunity to play organized baseball came as a student at Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy, a private school affiliated with the Methodist church. Richard Dubose, who had managed Doby's father and was known locally in African-American circles for his baseball expertise, gave Doby some of his first baseball lessons. Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina, including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats, Doby said, \\"Growing up in Camden, we didn't have baseball bats. We'd use a tree here, a tin can there, for bases.\\" After completing eighth grade, Doby moved north to Paterson at the age of 14 to be reunited with his mother; she visited him weekly while he lived with one of her friends. At Paterson Eastside High School, Doby was a multi-sport athlete; as well as playing baseball and basketball, he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track. After winning a state football championship, the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida, but the promoters would not allow Doby, the only black player on the team, to participate. Consequently, the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture of support for Doby. During summer vacation Doby played baseball with a black semi-pro team, the Smart Sets, where he played with future Hall of Fame shortstop Monte Irvin. He also had a brief stint with the Harlem Renaissance, a professional basketball team, as an unpaid substitute player. Upon completing high school, he accepted an athletic scholarship to play basketball at Long Island University Brooklyn (LIU). Doby had been dating Eastside classmate Helyn Curvy since his sophomore year and, according to Doby, being able to remain close to Paterson was the \\"main reason\\" he selected LIU. In the summer before he enrolled at LIU, Doby accepted an offer to play for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League (NNL) for the remainder of the 1942 season, and he transferred to Virginia Union University as a result. Negro leagues and World War II Negro league umpire Henry Moore advised Newark Eagles' owners Abe and Effa Manley to give Doby a tryout at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, which was successful; Doby joined the Eagles in 1942 at the age of 17 for $300. The contract stated Doby would play until September when he would start classes at college; to protect his amateur status he signed using the alias \\"Larry Walker\\" and local reporters were told he originated from Los Angeles, California. On May 31, Doby appeared in his first professional game when the Eagles played against the New York Cubans at Yankee Stadium. In the 26 games where box scores have been found, Doby's batting average was .391. Doby recalled a game against catcher Josh Gibson and pitcher Ray Brown of the Homestead Grays: > My first time up, Josh said, 'We're going to find out if you can hit a > fastball.' I singled. Next time up, Josh said, 'We're going to find out if > you can hit a curveball.' I singled. Third time up, Josh said, 'We're going > to find out how you do after you're knocked down.' I popped up the first > time after they knocked me down. The second time, I singled. Doby's career in Newark was interrupted for two years for service in the United States Navy. Doby spent 1943 and part of 1944 at Camp Robert Smalls at the Great Lakes Naval Training School near Chicago. He appeared on an all- black baseball squad and maintained a .342 batting average against teams composed of white players, some of which featured major leaguers. He then went to Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco Bay, California. Before serving in the Pacific Theater of World War II, Doby spent time at Navy sites in Ogden, Utah and San Diego, California. He was stationed on Ulithi in the Pacific Ocean in 1945. Doby heard of Jackie Robinson's minor league contract deal with the Montreal Royals of the International League from his base on Ulithi listening to Armed Forces Radio, and as a result Doby saw real hope in becoming a Major League baseball player. While in Hawaii, Doby met fellow Navy man and future teammate Mickey Vernon. Vernon, then with the Washington Senators, was so impressed with Doby's skills he wrote to Senators owner Clark Griffith, encouraging Griffith to sign Doby should the MLB ever allow integration. During his time in the Navy, Doby was described by his colleagues as quiet. Doby was discharged from the Navy in January 1946. In the summer of that year, Doby and Helyn Curvy were married. After playing for the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico, Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946. He made the All- Star roster, batted .360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six). Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles, including Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit .372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering a career in the MLB, Doby said, \\"I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought that that was the way it was going to be. There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in '46.\\" Major League Baseball career =Integration of American League (1947)= Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, which had been informally segregated since the turn of the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues. Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, reported Doby's off-field behavior was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect. But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, \\"One afternoon when the team trots out on the field, a Negro player will be out there with it.\\" While Rickey declined to pay for the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played for the Kansas City Monarchs, Veeck was \\"determined to buy Doby's contract from the Eagles\\" and had no problem paying purchasing rights. Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, believed her club's close relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform, but they did not take interest in him. Veeck finalized a contract deal for Doby with Manley on July 3. Veeck paid her a total of $15,000 for her second baseman‚Äî$10,000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $5,000 once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days. After Manley agreed to Veeck's offer, she stated to him, \\"If Larry Doby were white and a free agent, you'd give him $100,000 to sign as a bonus.\\" The press were not told that Doby had been signed by the Indians as Veeck wanted to manage how fans in Cleveland would be introduced to Doby. \\"I moved slowly and carefully, perhaps even timidly\\", Veeck said. The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby, who had a .415 batting average and 14 home runs to that point in the season, only played in the first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member, Louis Jones, for Doby. The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day. On July 5, with the Indians in Chicago in the midst of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black baseball player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. \\"I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here\\", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm- ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team. Doby entered the game in the seventh inning as a pinch- hitter for relief pitcher Bryan Stephens and recorded a strikeout. In the 1949 movie The Kid from Cleveland, Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate at-bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate. However, Doby's second strike was the result of a foul ball, both the Associated Press and Chicago Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three, and in addition, Gordon was standing on third base during Doby's at-bat. From Pride and Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby: > After the game, Doby quickly showered and dressed without incident in the > Cleveland clubhouse. His escort, Louis Jones, then took him not to the Del > Prado Hotel downtown, where the Indians players stayed, but to the black > DuSable Hotel in Chicago's predominantly black South Side, near Comiskey > Park. The segregated arrangement established a pattern, on Doby's first day, > that he would be compelled to follow, in spring training and during the > regular season, in many cities, throughout his playing career. The Indians had a doubleheader against the White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; it was estimated that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park. Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including first baseman Eddie Robinson, whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day. Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman's mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected. The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player. Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby, but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged. It was the only game Doby started for the remainder of the season. Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 5‚Äì1 Indians win. A columnist wrote in the Plain Dealer on July 8: \\"Cleveland's man in the street is the right sort of American, as was evidenced right solidly once more by the response to the question: 'How does the signing of Larry Doby by the Indians strike you? Said the man in the street: Can he hit? ... That's all that counts.\\" Conversely, Doby was criticized from players both active and retired. Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said, after watching Doby play one time in 1947: > Bill Veeck did the Negro race no favor when he signed Larry Doby to a > Cleveland contract. If Veeck wanted to demonstrate that the Negro has no > place in major league baseball, he could have used no subtler means to > establish the point. If he were white he wouldn't be considered good enough > to play with a semi-pro club. He is fast on his feet but that lets him out. > He hasn't any other quality that could possibly recommend him. In his rookie year, Doby hit .156 (5-for-32) in 29 games. He played four games at second base and one each at first base and shortstop. Throughout the season he talked with Robinson via telephone, the two encouraging each other. \\"And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble‚Äîor we'd both be out of the big leagues, just like that. We figured that if we spoke out, we would ruin things for other black players.\\" After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948. He was the first black player to join the league. =Cleveland Indians= 1948‚Äì1950 In 1948, Doby experienced his first spring training with the Indians in Tucson, Arizona. Unlike their white teammates, Doby, along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Mi√±oso, were not permitted to stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed with a local black family and used a rental car provided by the Indians for transportation. During spring training, Doby read books concerning outfield play, and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians manager Tris Speaker and Indians' farm system director Hank Greenberg. Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust to the majors and learning the outfield. In an exhibition game in Houston against the New York Giants, Doby hit a home run that \\"may have traveled 500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field.\\" As Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, \\"With that home run, all doubts that Doby would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished. That year, he played in 121 games and hit .301 for the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs. Throughout the regular season Doby was racially abused by opposing teams, and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players to rein in their animosity towards Doby. Doby played a major role in Cleveland's World Series victory against the Boston Braves. In Game 4 on October 9, Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World Series history. A picture featuring an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek, who had pitched a complete game that day, was on the cover of the next day's Plain Dealer. Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the photograph \\"a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball.\\" Of the picture, Doby said, \\"The picture was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run. The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me.\\" The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it, Cleveland had its first World Series championship since the 1920 season. Doby's .318 batting average during the Series led the Indians. Nationally syndicated columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden, who had won 20 games that year, the Indians would have finished in fourth or fifth place. After the Series, Doby received a celebratory parade in Paterson, New Jersey, and during the offseason he, along with other teammates, appeared in the 1949 film The Kid From Cleveland. With additional income available due to the post-season run and Series championship, Doby and his wife attempted to buy a home in Paterson in an all-white neighborhood but were kept out by a petition from members of the community. The Dobys were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor intervened on their behalf. right During the 1949 season, Doby was selected to his first MLB All-Star Game. He was one of five Indians selected by Boudreau and joined Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe as the first black players to be amongst those chosen to participate in the 1949 All-Star Game. Boudreau fined Doby after he attempted to steal home with no outs and bases loaded in a game against the Yankees on July 20. Of the fine, Boudreau said, \\"It was not based only on that attempt to steal home. Larry has taken several unnecessary chances lately. This should make him more careful.\\" His home run (24) and RBI (85) totals increased during the 1949 season, and by 1950, he was considered the best center fielder in the game by The Sporting News. By the first week in July, Doby's .370 batting average trailed only 1949 AL batting champion George Kell, who had a .375 average. He earned career-bests in batting average (.326), hits (164) and on-base percentage (OBP) (.442), while playing in 142 games. Doby hit the 100-RBI mark (102) for the first time in his career while his OBP led the AL. He finished eighth in AL MVP voting, highest among outfielders. At the end of the season, Cleveland signed him to a new, more lucrative contract. Doby was named by Cleveland sports writers as the Cleveland Baseball Man of the Year after the season, the first time a black player was chosen. 1951‚Äì1955 Doby hit 20 home runs and 69 RBIs in 1951, both fewer than the previous season, and his batting average improved to .295. His 21-game hit-streak was the second-longest for the Indians that season, behind Dale Mitchell's mark of 23 games in a row. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby's salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby, who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs, stating he would not accept a pay cut. Indians manager Al L√≥pez confirmed that Doby was injury-riddled throughout the season, stating that he \\"was beset by first one injury and then another\\" including \\"a muscle tear in his thigh, a groin pull, an ankle twist.\\" Doby received blame for the Indians' failure to win the AL pennant and was labeled a \\"loner\\" by some in the press, including Plain Dealer sports editor Gordon Cobbledick who in an article in Sport wrote \\"Larry's a mixed-up guy‚Äîa badly mixed-up guy\\" stemming from \\"the emotional impact of discovering racial prejudice against him.\\" Cobbledick also took issue with Doby's assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby being black. The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy, who wrote in the Baltimore Afro-American, \\"Statistics show that eight colored players in the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 1951 campaign, an average of times per man. No other player was hit as many as eight times in the season.\\" One month before spring training for the 1952 season, Doby employed former Olympic track and field athlete Harrison Dillard to come to his home in New Jersey to prepare his legs in hopes of eliminating injuries, which had affected him the previous season. Dillard and the Indians' team doctor prescribed lower-body warm-ups to Doby before the start of each game. Leg injuries continued to bother Doby during the start of the season. On June 4, 1952, he hit for the cycle. By the end of the 1952 season, Doby was second in the AL in RBIs to teammate Al Rosen by one, 105 to 104. His .541 slugging percentage, runs scored (104), strikeout (111), and home run (32) totals were all highest in the AL. Leading up to the 1953 season, Doby asked Greenberg and Indians management for a pay raise after earning $22,000 the previous season. In early March, the raise was granted, and he was slated to make $28,000 that year. For 1953, Doby had a .263 batting average, which was his lowest since joining the league in 1947. He led the AL in strikeouts for the second and final time in his career, a career-high 121 times, but hit 29 home runs and 102 RBIs on the year. He also had 96 walks, which was third in the AL. For the sixth time in his major league career, Doby was named an All- Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and featured the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 9‚Äì9; the AL squad went on to win, 11‚Äì9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All- Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants. In his last full season with the Indians in 1955, Doby was selected for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected him severely at this point in his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting .291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: \\"He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates ... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league.\\" Doby responded, \\"I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being. I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came after me, but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, not just to Black people.\\" =Later years (1956‚Äì1960)= After spending nine seasons with Cleveland, Doby was traded on October 25, 1955, to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby. Chicago was looking for a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team. \\"The search is over for a long ball hitter. We've certainly needed a consistent one‚Äîand we've been eying Doby for some time\\", said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey. White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby's bat would be a welcome addition to his club when he said, \\"The guy used to murder us when we played Cleveland. He'll make a big difference in the number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose.\\" After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22, 1956, Doby and the White Sox swept New York, the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four-game series. The White Sox won eight straight games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, and had done so with the help of Doby's six home runs during the eight-game stretch. \\"You know, when we dealt for Doby, we weren't worried about Larry. We knew he'd come through\\", Comiskey said. Doby finished the season with a .268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85‚Äì69 record. In a game on August 20, 1957 against the Washington Senators, Doby helped preserve pitcher Bob Keegan's no-hitter with a backhand catch off a long line drive from Herb Plews, one of \\"two close calls\\" for Keegan that game. His 1957 home run total of 14 tied for the team-high, as he managed a .288 average and recorded 79 RBIs, second-highest on the team after former Indians teammate Minnie Mi√±oso. The White Sox finished second in the AL with a 90‚Äì64 record. Doby was part of a December 3, 1957, multi-player trade between the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles, then was traded again on April 1 to Cleveland along with Don Ferrarese for Gene Woodling, Bud Daley, and Dick Williams. He appeared in 89 games with the Indians that season and had a .289 batting average, 13 home runs, and 45 RBIs. He was sent to the Detroit Tigers on March 21, 1959, in exchange for Tito Francona. Tigers general manager Rick Ferrell said, \\"this gives us some more power and we just hope Doby hits as well in Briggs Stadium this season as he has in other years.\\" With the Tigers he appeared in 18 games and was the first black player to play for the Tiger franchise. He hit .218 with four RBIs before Detroit sold the 35-year-old Doby to the White Sox on May 13 for $20,000. After 21 games with the White Sox, he was sent to Triple-A affiliate San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League after hitting .241 with no home runs and 9 RBIs. Doby fractured an ankle while sliding into third base after hitting a triple during a road game the Padres played against Sacramento, and was sent to a local hospital in Sacramento before going to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation. Doby worked out with the White Sox before the 1960 season but, due to nagging injuries, did not earn a roster spot. In late April he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League on a trial basis but was released by the team on May 6 after X-rays showed bone deterioration in his affected ankle. Doby finished his 13-year major league career with a .283 batting average, accumulated 1,515 hits, 253 home runs and 970 RBIs in 1,533 games and 5,348 at-bats. Of his 1,533 career games, 1,146 of them were spent with the Indians. \\"I played against great talent in the Major Leagues and I played against great talent in the Negro Leagues. I didn't see a lot of difference\\", said Doby. =Nippon baseball (1962)= Doby had participated in baseball clinics in 1962 as a member of a travel delegation from the U.S. Department of State. That year, Doby came out of retirement and became one of the first Americans to play professional baseball in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league when he and Don Newcombe, a former teammate with the Newark Eagles, signed contracts with the Chunichi Dragons. After the season, Doby returned to the U.S. in October and resumed his work as a liquor retailer. Managerial and executive appointments After retiring as a player, Doby became a scout with the Montreal Expos in 1969 and served as a minor league instructor with the organization in 1970. He was batting coach under manager Gene Mauch from 1971 to 1973 and again in 1976. He managed various teams during five seasons of winter league baseball in Venezuela, including √Åguilas del Zulia during the 1970‚Äì71 winter season. Doby rejoined the Indians for the 1974 season as first base coach for manager Ken Aspromonte. When Aspromonte was fired after the 1974 season, the Indians named Frank Robinson the club's player-manager and baseball's first black manager. After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby returned to work for the Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a .255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was .284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a .281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. \\"It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work as hard as you can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams\\", Doby said after being named White Sox manager. To that point in the season, the White Sox had a 34‚Äì40 record. On July 1 in his first game as manager, the White Sox suffered a 10‚Äì0 loss to the Minnesota Twins but Doby won his second game, 8‚Äì5, the next day against the same team. The White Sox finished 71‚Äì90, including 37‚Äì50 under Doby, in what would be Doby's sole managerial role. Veeck hired player-manager Don Kessinger to succeed Doby after deciding not to re-hire Doby, although Kessinger resigned as manager in the second half of the 1979 season. After removing Doby from the manager's role and reassigning him to batting coach, the position Doby held before being named manager, Veeck said, \\"Larry will always have a role on this team in some capacity.\\" He served in that role for one additional season and resigned in October 1979. After retiring from baseball, Doby was named director of communications for the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets from 1980 to 1989 and also served as the Nets' director of community affairs until 1990. Doby was named special assistant to the AL's last president, Gene Budig, on April 17, 1995. Second man The New York Times wrote, \\"In glorifying those who are first, the second is often forgotten ... Larry Doby integrated all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And he did it with class and clout.\\" During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, \\"Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear.\\" \\"Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'\\" Doby said. Doby served as one of the pallbearers at Robinson's funeral. As fellow Hall of Famer Joe Morgan wrote, \\"Anyone who knew Larry knew that he admired Robinson and was never jealous of the attention Robinson received.\\" Former teammate Al Rosen said: > Jackie was a college educated man who had been an officer in the service and > who played at the Triple-A level. Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey > specifically to be the first black player in major league baseball. Larry > Doby came up as a second baseman who didn't have time to get his full > college education, and was forced to play a different position in his first > major league season. I think, because of those circumstances, he had a more > difficult time than Jackie Robinson. I don't think he has gotten the credit > he deserves. Doby experienced many prejudices during his time before, during, and after the majors. One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him. Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field. He endured many racial slurs, from the stands and elsewhere, during games. He also received death threats. After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of his days as a barrier-breaker. \\"You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name. You know most of them couldn't afford to be there. I never forgot them.\\" Shortly after the Indians had honored Doby by naming a nearby street after him, The Plain Dealer columnist Bill Livingston wrote, \\"The Larry Doby way of pioneering was the same as the Jackie Robinson way in the National League, only Doby's debut occurred six short weeks later and with almost no advance preparation by Doby or the Indians.\\" Doby threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Jacobs Field. The decision to have the game in Cleveland coincided with the 1997 season marking the fiftieth anniversary of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier. It was also 50 years and 3 days since Doby became the first black player in the American League. Hall of Fame Doby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3, 1998, by the Veterans Committee at the age of 74. \\"This is just a tremendous feeling. It's kind of like a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders, and now it's off\\", said Doby. When he received word about his election, it was by a telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby's election, Gene Mauch, said, \\"You have to be some kind of special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I'm not too sure there's a player in the game today who could handle it.\\" He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on July 26, 1998. Doby became the first member born in South Carolina elected to the Hall. Although he was the first to play in MLB, Doby was the last member elected to the Hall of the four players to ever play in both a Negro league and MLB World Series, the others being Satchel Paige, Monte Irvin, and Willie Mays. Death and legacy Doby and his wife, Helyn, had five children, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. When the Dobys moved to Montclair, Yogi Berra and his wife became neighborhood friends and children of the two families played baseball and football together. Doby had a kidney removed in 1997 after a cancerous tumor was detected. Helyn, married to Doby for 55 years, died in 2001 after a six-month battle with cancer. Doby died on June 18, 2003, at his home in Montclair, New Jersey, at age 79 after suffering cancer. When Doby died, President George W. Bush made the following statement: MLB Commissioner Bud Selig (1992‚Äì2015) released a statement a day following Doby's death: Former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said: Long before Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame came induction in the Indians Hall of Fame in August 1966. Later, in May 1973, he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and in 2010, the New Jersey Hall of Fame. On August 10, 2007, the Indians paid tribute to Doby on Larry Doby Day by collectively using his number (14) on their uniforms. The franchise again honored him when in 2012, Eagle Avenue, next to the Indians' Progressive Field, was renamed \\"Larry Doby Way\\" in an on-field postgame ceremony. Among those present at the ceremony were Jim \\"Mudcat\\" Grant, Indians president Mark Shapiro, Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson, and various members of Doby's family. The city of Paterson, New Jersey, renamed the Eastside Park baseball field \\"Larry Doby Field\\" on June 1, 2002. The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named the Larry Doby Wing. Of Berra, Doby said, \\"Yogi was one of the first opposing players to talk to me. As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally had to tell the umpire: 'Please tell him to shut up. He asked me how my family was back in the first inning.'\\" In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012, as part of its \\"Major League Baseball All-Stars\\" series. The stamp was released July 21, 2012.

TSEs are a family of diseases thought to be caused by misfolded proteins called prions and includes similar diseases such as BSE (mad cow disease) in cattle, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and scrapie in sheep. In the US, CWD affects mule deer, white-tailed deer, red deer, sika deer, elk, caribou, and moose. Natural infection causing CWD affects members of the deer family. Experimental transmission of CWD to other species such as squirrel monkeys, and genetically modified mice has been shown. In 1967, CWD was first identified in mule deer at a government research facility in northern Colorado, United States. It was initially recognized as a clinical \\"wasting\\" syndrome and then in 1978, it was identified more specifically as a TSE disease. Since then, CWD has been found in free-ranging and captive animal populations in 26 US states and three Canadian provinces. In addition, CWD has been found in one Minnesota red deer farm, one wild reindeer herd in Norway (March 2016) as well as in wild moose. Single cases of CWD in moose have been found in Finland (March 2018) and in Sweden (March and May 2019, September 2020). CWD was found in South Korea in some deer imported from Canada. CWD is typified by chronic weight loss and clinical signs compatible with brain lesions, aggravated over time, always leading to death. No relationship is known between CWD and any other TSEs of animals or people. Although reports in the popular press have been made of humans being affected by CWD, by 2004 a study for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested, \\"[m]ore epidemiologic and laboratory studies are needed to monitor the possibility of such transmissions\\". The epidemiological study further concluded, \\"[a]s a precaution, hunters should avoid eating deer and elk tissues known to harbor the CWD agent (e.g., brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes) from areas where CWD has been identified\\". History Chronic wasting disease was first discovered by American wildlife veterinarian Beth S. Williams. Williams performed necropsies on deer and elk that had died of an unknown syndrome. She recognized that the brain lesions in these animals were consistent with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). In 1978, she and neuropathologist Stuart Young cowrote the first scientific paper that named the disease and described it as a TSE.  Signs and symptoms  Most cases of CWD occur in adult animals; the youngest animal to exhibit clinical symptoms of the disease was 15 months. The disease is progressive and always fatal. The first signs are difficulties in movement. The most obvious and consistent clinical sign of CWD is weight loss over time. Behavioral changes also occur in the majority of cases, including decreased interactions with other animals, listlessness, lowering of the head, tremors, repetitive walking in set patterns, and nervousness. Excessive salivation and grinding of the teeth also are observed. Most deer show increased drinking and urination; the increased drinking and salivation may contribute to the spread of the disease. Loss of fear of humans and appearance of confusion are also common. A scientist at APHIS summed it up this way:  Cause  The cause of CWD (like other TSEs, such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a prion, a misfolded form of a normal protein, known as prion protein (PrP), that is most commonly found in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The misfolded form has been shown to be capable of converting normally folded prion protein, PrPC (\\"C\\" for cellular) into an abnormal form, PrPSc (\\"Sc\\" for scrapie), thus leading to a chain reaction. CWD is thought to be transmitted by this mechanism. The abnormality in PrP has its genetic basis in a particular variant of the protein-coding gene PRNP that is highly conserved among mammals and has been found and sequenced in deer. The build-up of PrPd in the brain is associated with widespread neurodegeneration.USGS National Wildlife Health Center Frequently asked questions concerning Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) Page last updated May 21, 2013; page accessed April 25, 2016 =Genetics= The allele which encodes leucine, codon 132 in the family of Elks, is either homozygous LL, homozygous MM, or heterozygous ML. Individuals with the first encoding seem to resist clinical signs of CWD, whereas individuals with either of the other two encodings have much shorter incubation periods. In white-tailed deer, polymorphisms at codons 95(Q->H) and 96 (G->S) dramatically affect CWD progression and prion strain specification. Deer containing the 96S allele have delayed progression to clinical disease onset. When deer with the 95H polymorphism become infected, they select for altered strains of CWD. = Spread = As of 2013, no evidence has been found of transmission to humans from deer, nor by eating animals in the deer family, but both channels remain a subject of public health surveillance and research. Researchers in July 2019 that \\"with all the research on the malignity of prions, and the permanence of prions in the wider environment, and their resistance to destruction and degradation, it is necessary to reduce the potential sources of exposure to CWD.\\" In fact an APHIS scientist observed that, while the longevity of CWD prion is unknown, the scrapie prion has been measured to endure for 16 years. The PrPCWD protein is insoluble in all but the strongest solvents, and highly resistant to digestion by proteases. PrPCWD converts the normal protein PrPC into more of itself upon contact, and binds together forming aggregates. Prusiner noted in 2001 that but it is noted that as of 2013, although CWD prions were transmissible within the cervidae family, CWD was not transmissible to humans or to cattle. How the prions that cause CWD spread is unknown, but recent research indicates that prions can be excreted by deer and elk, and are transmitted by eating grass growing in contaminated soil. Animals born in captivity and those born in the wild have been affected with the disease. Transmission of CWD is thought to be lateral (from animal to animal). Maternal transmission may occur, although it appears to be relatively unimportant in maintaining epidemics. An infected deer's saliva is able to spread the CWD prions. Exposure between animals is associated with sharing food and water sources contaminated with CWD prions shed by diseased deer.  Direct  CWD may be directly transmitted by contact with infected animals, their bodily tissues, and their bodily fluids. Spread may result from contact with infected deer regardless of if they are symptomatic. Recent research on Rocky Mountain elk found that with CWD- infected cows, many subclinical, a high rate (80%) of maternal-to-offspring transmission of CWD prions occurred, regardless of gestational period. While not dispositive relative to disease development in the fetus, this does suggest that maternal transmission may be yet another important route of direct CWD transmission.  Experimental transmission  In addition to the cervid species in which CWD is known to naturally occur, black-tailed deer and European red deer have been demonstrated to be naturally susceptible to CWD. Other cervid species, including caribou, are also suspected to be naturally vulnerable to this disease. Many other noncervid mammalian species have been experimentally infected with CWD, either orally or by intracerebral inoculation. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets. An experimental case study of oral transmission of CWD to reindeer shows certain reindeer breeds may be susceptible to CWD, while other subpopulations may be protective against CWD in free-ranging populations. None of the reindeer in the study showed symptoms of CWD, potentially signifying resistance to different CWD strains.  Indirect  Environmental transmission has been linked to contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues, as well as contact with contaminated environments. Once in the environment, CWD prions may remain infectious for many years. Thus, decomposition of diseased carcasses, infected \\"gut piles\\" from hunters who field dress their cervid harvests, and the urine, saliva, feces, and antler velvet of infected individuals that are deposited in the environment, all have the potential to create infectious environmental reservoirs of CWD. In 2013, researchers at the National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins, Colorado successfully inoculated white-tailed deer with the misfolded prion via the nasal passage, when the prions were mixed with clay. This was important because the prions had already been shown by 2006 to bind with sandy quartz clay minerals. One avian scavenger, the American crow, was recently evaluated as a potential vector for CWD. As CWD prions remain viable after passing through the bird's digestive tract, crows represent a possible mechanism for the creation of environmental reservoirs of CWD. Additionally, the crows' extensive geographic range presents ample opportunities for them to come in contact with CWD. This, coupled with the population density and longevity of communal roosting sites in both urban and rural locations, suggests that the fecal deposits at roosting sites may represent a CWD environmental reservoir. Conservative estimates for crows' fecal deposits at one winter roosting site for one winter season ranged from 391,552 to 599,032 kg. CWD prions adhere so tightly to soil surface particles that the ground becomes a source of infection and may be a major route of transmission due to frequent ground contact when animals in the deer family graze. Prevention By 2012, a voluntary system of control was published by APHIS in the US Federal Register. It depended on voluntary minimum standards methodology, and herd certification programs to avoid interstate movement of the disease vector. It was based on a risk management framework. As of August 2019, APHIS law in 9 CFR Part 55 - CONTROL OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE dealt with this problem. The MFFP ministry in Quebec practiced 9500 tests in the period between 2007 and autumn 2018 before they detected a seropositive case in September 2018. The September 2018 discovery of CWD on a managed operation in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge Quebec prompted a wholesale slaughter of 3500 animals in two months before the enterprise shut its doors for good. The CFIA ordered the cull, as well as the decontamination of 10 inches of soil in certain places on the 1000-acre operation. Post-discovery, each animal was tested for CWD by the CFIA before it was released onto the market. Other Quebec producers lamented the glut of supply. A 400 km quarantine area was declared, in which all hunting and trapping activities were banned. Government massacred hundreds of wild beasts over a two-month period. The routine cull for market was between 70 and 100 animals per week. When the producer was forced to close, the weekly slaughter neared 500 beasts per week. One year later, 750 wild specimens had been culled in the 45 km-radius \\"enhanced monitoring area\\", and none tested positive for CWD. It came to light in August 2019 that prior to 2014 in Canada, all animals on CWD-infected farms were buried or incinerated. But in a mysterious change of policy, since then the CFIA has allowed animals from CWD-infected farms to enter the food chain because there is \\"no national requirement to have animals tested for the disease\\". From one CWD-infected herd in Alberta, 131 elk were sold for human consumption. For the fall 2019 hunting season in western Quebec, the provincial ministry relaxed the rules for the annual white-tailed deer (WTD) hunt, in an effort to curb the spread of CWD. Any WTD can be hunted with any weapon in certain municipalities in the Outaouais valley and the Laurentides. The MFFP hopes thereby to receive more samples to test for CWD. The quarantine around Grenville was still in place, and the ministry specifically prohibited (only) the \\"removal\\" from the quarantine \\"enhanced monitoring area\\" zone of \\"the head, more specifically any part of the brain, the eyes, the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils, any part of the spinal column, the internal organs (including the liver and the heart), and the testicles.\\" Introduced for the 2019 Minnesota hunting season, a no-cost deer carcass-incineration program was rolled out by Crow Wing County officials hoping to stem the spread of CWD in the region. CWD was found among wild deer in Crow Wing County for the first time in January 2019. The voluntary program encourages both residents and visiting hunters to bring harvested deer carcasses to the county landfill east of Brainerd, Minnesota for incineration and disposal.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is based on post mortem examination (necropsy) and testing; examination of the dead body is not definitive, as many animals die early in the course of the disease and conditions found are nonspecific; general signs of poor health and aspiration pneumonia, which may be the actual cause of death, are common. On microscopic examination, lesions of CWD in the CNS resemble those of other TSEs. In addition, scientists use immunohistochemistry to test brain, lymph, and neuroendocrine tissues for the presence of the abnormal prion protein to diagnose CWD; positive IHC findings in the obex is considered the gold standard. Conventional CWD diagnostic strategies and seeded amplification methods for amplifying CWD prions in vitro include: immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting (WB), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), and real time quaking- induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Available tests, as of July 2019, at the CFIA were not sensitive enough to detect the prion in specimens from animals younger than a year old. Strategies are being developed to allow for the quantification of prion burden in a tissue, body fluid, or environmental sample. As of 2015, no commercially feasible diagnostic tests could be used on live animals. As early as 2001 an antemortem test was deemed urgent. Running a bioassay, taking fluids from animals in the deer family suspected of infection and incubating them in transgenic mice that express the cervid prion protein, can be used to determine whether the cervid is infected, but ethical issues exist with this, and it is not scalable. A tonsillar biopsy technique has been a reliable method of testing for CWD in live deer, but it only seems to be effective on mule deer and white-tailed deer, not elk. Biopsies of the rectal mucosa have also been effective at detecting CWD in live mule deer, white- tailed deer, and elk, though detection efficacy may be influenced by numerous factors including animal age, genotype, and disease stage. It is possible for CWD prions to survive sterilization procedures involving an autoclave.  Epidemiology  Reported cases of chronic wasting disease in North America, as of 2018 =North America= The disease was first identified in 1967 in a closed herd of captive mule deer in contiguous portions of northeastern Colorado. In 1980, the disease was determined to be a TSE. It was first identified in wild elk and mule deer and white-tailed deer in the early 1980s in Colorado and Wyoming, and in farmed elk in 1997. Canada was not affected by the disease until 1996. In May 2001, CWD was also found in free-ranging deer in the southwestern corner of Nebraska (adjacent to Colorado and Wyoming) and later in additional areas in western Nebraska. The limited area of northern Colorado, southern Wyoming, and western Nebraska in which free-ranging deer, moose, and/or elk positive for CWD have been found is referred to as the endemic area. The area in 2006 has expanded to six states, including parts of eastern Utah, southwestern South Dakota, and northwestern Kansas. Also, areas not contiguous (to the endemic area) areas in central Utah and central Nebraska have been found. The limits of the affected areas are not well defined, since the disease is at a low incidence and the amount of sampling may not be adequate to detect it. In 2002, CWD was detected in wild deer in south-central Wisconsin and northern Illinois and in an isolated area of southern New Mexico. In 2005, it was found in wild white-tailed deer in New York and in Hampshire County, West Virginia. In 2008, the first confirmed case of CWD in Michigan was discovered in an infected deer on an enclosed deer- breeding facility. It is also found in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In February 2011, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources reported the first confirmed case of the disease in that state. The affected animal was a white-tailed deer killed by a hunter. CWD has also been diagnosed in farmed elk and deer herds in a number of states and in two Canadian provinces. The first positive farmed-elk herd in the United States was detected in 1997 in South Dakota. Since then, additional positive elk herds and farmed white-tailed deer herds have been found in South Dakota (7), Nebraska (4), Colorado (10), Oklahoma (1), Kansas (1), Minnesota (3), Montana (1), Wisconsin (6), and New York (2). As of fall of 2006, four positive elk herds in Colorado and a positive white-tailed deer herd in Wisconsin remain under state quarantine. All of the other herds have been depopulated or have been slaughtered and tested, and the quarantine has been lifted from one herd that underwent rigorous surveillance with no further evidence of disease. CWD also has been found in farmed elk in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. A retrospective study also showed mule deer exported from Denver to the Toronto Zoo in the 1980s were affected. In June 2015, the disease was detected in a male white-tailed deer on a breeding ranch in Medina County, Texas. State officials euthanized 34 deer in an effort to contain a possible outbreak. In February 2018, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks announced that a Mississippi deer tested positive for chronic wasting disease. Another Mississippi whitetail euthanized in Pontotoc County on 8 October 2018 tested positive for CWD. The disease was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa on 30 October 2018.Times Daily Florence, AL 11/12/18 Species that have been affected with CWD include elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, and moose. Other ruminant species, including wild ruminants and domestic cattle, sheep, and goats, have been housed in wildlife facilities in direct or indirect contact with CWD-affected deer and elk, with no evidence of disease transmission. However, experimental transmission of CWD into other ruminants by intracranial inoculation does result in disease, suggesting only a weak molecular species barrier exists. Research is ongoing to further explore the possibility of transmission of CWD to other species. By April 2016, CWD had been found in captive animals in South Korea; the disease arrived there with live elk that were imported from Canada for farming in the late 1990s.Rachel Becker for Nature News. April 18, 2016 Deadly animal prion disease appears in Europe In the summer of 2018, cases were discovered in the Harpur Farm herd in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec. Over the course of 2018 fully 12% of the mule deer that were tested in Alberta, had a positive result. More than 8% of Alberta deer were deemed seropositive. = Europe = In 2016, the first case of CWD in Europe was from the Nordfjella wild reindeer herd in southern Norway. Scientists found the diseased female reindeer as it was dying, and routine CWD screening at necropsy was unexpectedly positive. The origin of CWD in Norway is unknown, whereas import of infected deer from Canada was the source of CWD cases in South Korea. Norway has strict legislation and rules not allowing importation of live animals and deer into the country. Norway has a scrapie surveillance program since 1997; while no reports of scrapie within the range of Nordfjella reindeer population have been identified, sheep are herded through that region and are a potential source of infection. In May and June 2016, two infected wild moose (Alces alces) were found around 300 km north from the first case, in Selbu.Norwegian Food Safety Authority. Chronic Wasting Disease in Norway. Published July 13, 2016; updated July 14, 2016 By the end of August, a fourth case had been confirmed in a wild reindeer shot in the same area as the first case in March. In 2017, the Environment Agency of the Norwegian government released guidelines for hunters hunting reindeer in the Nordfjella areas. The guidelines contain information on identifying animals with CWD symptoms and instructions for minimizing the risk of contamination, as well as a list of supplies given to hunters to be used for taking and submitting samples from shot reindeer. In March 2018, Finnish Food Safety Authority EVIRA stated that the first case of CWD in Finland had been diagnosed in a 15-year-old moose (Alces alces) that had died naturally in the municipality of Kuhmo in the Kainuu region. Before this case in Kuhmo, Norway was the only country in the European Economic Area where CWD has been diagnosed. The moose did not have the transmissible North American form of the disease, but similar to the Norwegian variant of CWD, an atypical or sporadic form which occurs incidentally in individual animals of the deer family. In Finland, CWD screening of fallen wild deer has been done since 2003. None of the roughly 2,500 samples analyzed so far have tested positive for the disease. The export of live animals of the deer family to other countries has been temporarily banned as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of the CWD, and moose hunters are going to be provided with more instructions before the start of the next hunting season, if appropriate. The export and sales of meat from deer will not be restricted and moose meat is considered safe to eat as only the brain and nervous tissue of infected moose contains prions. In March 2019, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) diagnosed the first case of CWD in Sweden. A 16-year old emaciated female moose was found in the municipality of Arjeplog in the county of Norrbotten, circling and with loss of shyness towards humans, possibly blind. The moose was euthanized and the head was sent for CWD screening in the national CWD surveillance program. The brainstem tissue, but not lymph nodes, was positive for CWD (confirmed with Western Blot). A second case of CWD was diagnosed in May 2019, with very similar case history, about 70 km east of the first case. This second case, in the municipality of Arvidsjaur, was also an emaciated and apathic 16-year-old female moose that was euthanized. The circumstances of these Swedish cases are similar to the CWD cases in moose in both Norway and Finland. The EU regulated CWD surveillance runs between 2018 - 2020. A minimum of 6 000 deer are to be tested, both free-ranging animals in the deer family, farmed red deer, and semi-domesticated reindeer. The finding of CWD-positive moose initiated an intensified surveillance in the affected municipalities. Adult hunter- harvested moose and slaughtered semi-domesticated reindeer from the area are tested for CWD. In September 2019, a third moose was found positive for CWD, a hunter-harvested 10-year-old apparently healthy female moose from Arjeplog. A fourth case of CWD in moose was verified in September 2020, in a euthanized 14-year-old lame and unshy female moose in the municipality of Robertsfors, in the county of V√§sterbotten, approximately 200 km from the previous moose cases in the neighboring county of Norrbotten.https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/jordbruksverket/pressreleases/nytt- fall-av-avmagringssjuka-cwd-paa-aelg-3037551 Research Research is focused on better ways to monitor disease in the wild, live animal diagnostic tests, developing vaccines, better ways to dispose of animals that died from the disease and to decontaminate the environment, where prions can persist in soils, and better ways to monitor the food supply. Deer harvesting and management issues are intertwined.  References   External links  *This entry incorporates public domain text originally at What is chronic wasting disease?

She would gnaw on their bones and suck their blood, as well as being charged with a number of other evil deeds. She was a daughter of the Sky God Anu. Lamashtu is depicted as a mythological hybrid, with a hairy body, a lioness' head with donkey's teeth and ears, long fingers and fingernails, and the feet of a bird with sharp talons. She is often shown standing or kneeling on a donkey, nursing a pig and a dog, and holding snakes. She thus bears some functions and resemblance to the Mesopotamian demon Lilith. Mythology Lamashtu's father was the Sky God Anu. Unlike many other usual demonic figures and depictions in Mesopotamian lore, Lamashtu was said to act in malevolence of her own accord, rather than at the gods' instructions. Along with this her name was written together with the cuneiform determinative indicating deity.Line 47 has ddim- me, the superscript d being the divine determinative. This means she was a goddess or a demigoddess in her own right. She bore seven names and was described as seven witches in incantations. Her evil deeds included (but were not limited to): slaying children, unborns, and neonates; causing harm to mothers and expectant mothers; eating men and drinking their blood; disturbing sleep; bringing nightmares; killing foliage; infesting rivers and lakes; and being a bringer of disease, sickness, and death. Pazuzu, a god or demon, was invoked to protect birthing mothers and infants against Lamashtu's malevolence, usually on amulets and statues. Although Pazuzu was said to be bringer of famine and drought, he was also invoked against evil for protection, and against plague, but he was primarily and popularly invoked against his fierce, malicious rival Lamashtu.

In the earliest records, he is a god of agriculture and healing, who releases humans from sickness and the power of demons. In later times, as Mesopotamia grew more militarized, he became a warrior deity, though he retained many of his earlier agricultural attributes. He was regarded as the son of the chief god Enlil and his main cult center in Sumer was the Eshumesha temple in Nippur. Ninƒùirsu was honored by King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144‚Äì2124 BC), who rebuilt Ninƒùirsu's temple in Lagash. Later, Ninurta became beloved by the Assyrians as a formidable warrior. The Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883‚Äì859 BC) built a massive temple for him at Kalhu, which became his most important cult center from then on. After the fall of the Assyrian Empire, Ninurta's statues were torn down and his temples abandoned because he had become too closely associated with the Assyrian regime, which many conquered peoples saw as tyrannical and oppressive. In the epic poem Lugal-e, Ninurta slays the demon Asag using his talking mace Sharur and uses stones to build the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to make them useful for irrigation. In a poem sometimes referred to as the \\"Sumerian Georgica\\", Ninurta provides agricultural advice to farmers. In an Akkadian myth, he was the champion of the gods against the Anz√ª bird after it stole the Tablet of Destinies from his father Enlil and, in a myth that is alluded to in many works but never fully preserved, he killed a group of warriors known as the \\"Slain Heroes\\". His major symbols were a perched bird and a plow. Ninurta may have been the inspiration for the figure of Nimrod, a \\"mighty hunter\\" who is mentioned in association with Kalhu in the Book of Genesis. He may also be mentioned in the Second Book of Kings under the name Nisroch. In the nineteenth century, Assyrian stone reliefs of winged, eagle-headed figures from the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu were commonly, but erroneously, identified as \\"Nisrochs\\" and they appear in works of fantasy literature from the time period.  Worship  Gudea dedication tablet to God Ningirsu: \\"For Ningirsu, Enlil's mighty warrior, his Master; Gudea, ensi of Lagash\\". The Gudea cylinders, dating to 2125 BC, describe how King Gudea of Lagash rebuilt the temple of Ninƒùirsu in Lagash as the result of a dream in which he was instructed to do so. Ninurta was worshipped in Mesopotamia as early as the middle of the third millennium BC by the ancient Sumerians, and is one of the earliest attested deities in the region. His main cult center was the Eshumesha temple in the Sumerian city-state of Nippur, where he was worshipped as the god of agriculture and the son of the chief-god Enlil. Though they may have originally been separate deities, in historical times, the god Ninƒùirsu, who was worshipped in the Sumerian city-state of Girsu, was always identified as a local form of Ninurta. According to the Assyriologists Jeremy Black and Anthony Green, the two gods' personalities are \\"closely intertwined\\". King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144‚Äì2124 BC) dedicated himself to Ninƒùirsu and the Gudea cylinders, dating to 2125 BC, record how he rebuilt the temple of Ninƒùirsu in Lagash as the result of a dream in which he was instructed to do so. The Gudea cylinders record the longest surviving account written in the Sumerian language known to date. Gudea's son Ur-Ninƒùirsu incorporated Ninƒùirsu's name as part of his own in order to honor him. As the city-state of Girsu declined in importance, Ninƒùirsu became increasingly known as \\"Ninurta\\". Though Ninurta was originally worshipped solely as a god of agriculture, in later times, as Mesopotamia became more urban and militarized, he began to be increasingly seen as a warrior deity instead. He became primarily characterized by the aggressive, warlike aspect of his nature. In spite of this, however, he continued to be seen as a healer and protector, and he was commonly invoked in spells to protect against demons, disease, and other dangers. In later times, Ninurta's reputation as a fierce warrior made him immensely popular among the Assyrians. In the late second millennium BC, Assyrian kings frequently held names which included the name of Ninurta, such as Tukulti-Ninurta (\\"the trusted one of Ninurta\\"), Ninurta-apal-Ekur (\\"Ninurta is the heir of [Ellil's temple] Ekur\\"), and Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur (\\"Ninurta is the god A≈°≈°ur's trusted one\\"). Tukulti-Ninurta I (ruled 1243‚Äì1207 BC) declares in one inscription that he hunts \\"at the command of the god Ninurta, who loves me.\\" Similarly, Adad-nirari II (ruled 911‚Äì891 BC) claimed Ninurta and A≈°≈°ur as supporters of his reign, declaring his destruction of their enemies as moral justification for his right to rule. In the ninth century BC, when Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883‚Äì859 BC) moved the capital of the Assyrian Empire to Kalhu, the first temple he built there was one dedicated to Ninurta. 1853 restoration of what the city of Kalhu, Ninurta's main cult center in the Assyrian Empire, might have originally looked like, based on the excavations of the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard there in the 1840s The walls of the temple were decorated with stone relief carvings, including one of Ninurta slaying the Anz√ª bird. Ashurnasirpal II's son Shalmaneser III (ruled 859‚Äì824 BC) completed Ninurta's ziggurat at Kalhu and dedicated a stone relief of himself to the god. On the carving, Shalmaneser III's boasts of his military exploits and credits all his victories to Ninurta, declaring that, without Ninurta's aid, none of them would have been possible. When Adad-nirari III (ruled 811‚Äì783 BC) dedicated a new endowment to the temple of A≈°≈°ur in Assur, they were sealed with both the seal of A≈°≈°ur and the seal of Ninurta. Assyrian stone reliefs from the Kalhu period show A≈°≈°ur as a winged disc, with Ninurta's name written beneath it, indicating the two were seen as near- equals. After the capital of Assyria was moved away from Kalhu, Ninurta's importance in the pantheon began to decline. Sargon II favored Nabu, the god of scribes, over Ninurta. Nonetheless, Ninurta still remained an important deity. Even after the kings of Assyria left Kalhu, the inhabitants of the former capital continued to venerate Ninurta, who they called \\"Ninurta residing in Kalhu\\". Legal documents from the city record that those who violated their oaths were required to \\"place two minas of silver and one mina of gold in the lap of Ninurta residing in Kalhu.\\" The last attested example of this clause dates to 669 BC, the last year of the reign of King Esarhaddon (ruled 681 ‚Äì 669 BC). The temple of Ninurta at Kalhu flourished until the end of the Assyrian Empire, hiring the poor and destitute as employees. The main cultic personnel were a ≈°ang√ª-priest and a chief singer, who were supported by a cook, a steward, and a porter. In the late seventh century BC, the temple staff witnessed legal documents, along with the staff of the temple of Nabu at Ezida. The two temples shared a qƒìpu-official.  Iconography  Male figure in an Assyrian winged sun emblem from the Northwest Palace at Kalhu. Some authors have speculated that this figure may, in fact, be Ninurta, but most scholars reject this assertion as unfounded. In artistic representations, Ninurta is shown as a warrior, carrying a bow and arrow and clutching Sharur, his magic talking mace. He sometimes has a set of wings, raised upright, ready to attack. In Babylonian art, he is often shown standing on the back of or riding a beast with the body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion. Ninurta remained closely associated with agricultural symbolism as late as the middle of the second millennium BC. On kudurrus from the Kassite Period ( 1600 ‚Äî 1155 BC), a plough is captioned as a symbol of Ninƒùirsu. The plough also appears in Neo-Assyrian art, possibly as a symbol of Ninurta. A perched bird is also used as a symbol of Ninurta during the Neo-Assyrian Period. One speculative hypothesis holds that the winged disc originally symbolized Ninurta during the ninth century BC, but was later transferred to A≈°≈°ur and the sun-god Shamash. This idea is based on some early representations in which the god on the winged disc appears to have the tail of a bird. Most scholars have rejected this suggestion as unfounded. Astronomers of the eighth and seventh centuries BC identified Ninurta (or Pabilsaƒù) with the constellation Sagittarius. Alternatively, others identified him with the star Sirius, which was known in Akkadian as ≈°uk≈´du, meaning \\"arrow\\". The constellation of Canis Major, of which Sirius is the most visible star, was known as qa≈°tu, meaning \\"bow\\", after the bow and arrow Ninurta was believed to carry. In Babylonian times, Ninurta was associated with the planet Saturn.  Family  Limestone bust of a goddess from Girsu, possibly Ninurta's consort Bau, wearing a horned cap Ninurta was believed to be the son of Enlil. In Lugal-e, his mother is identified as the goddess Ninmah, whom he renames Ninhursag, but, in Angim dimma, his mother is instead the goddess Ninlil. Under the name Ninurta, his wife is usually the goddess Gula, but, as Ninƒùirsu, his wife is the goddess Bau. Gula was the goddess of healing and medicine and she was sometimes alternately said to be the wife of the god Pabilsaƒù or the minor vegetation god Abu. Bau was worshipped \\"almost exclusively in Lagash\\" and was sometimes alternately identified as the wife of the god Zababa. She and Ninƒùirsu were believed to have two sons: the gods Ig-alima and ≈†ul-≈°agana. Bau also had seven daughters, but Ninƒùirsu was not claimed to be their father. As the son of Enlil, Ninurta's siblings include: Nanna, Nergal, Ninazu, Enbilulu, and sometimes Inanna.  Mythology  = Lugal-e = Second only to the goddess Inanna, Ninurta probably appears in more myths than any other Mesopotamian deity. In the Sumerian poem Lugal-e, also known as Ninurta's Exploits, a demon known as Asag has been causing sickness and poisoning the rivers. Ninurta's talking mace Sharur urges him to battle Asag. Ninurta confronts Asag, who is protected by an army of stone warriors. Ninurta initially \\"flees like a bird\\", but Sharur urges him to fight. Ninurta slays Asag and his armies. Then Ninurta organizes the world, using the stones from the warriors he has defeated to build the mountains, which he designs so that the streams, lakes and rivers all flow into the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, making them useful for irrigation and agriculture. Ninurta's mother Ninmah descends from Heaven to congratulate her son on his victory. Ninurta dedicates the mountain of stone to her and renames her Ninhursag, meaning \\"Lady of the Mountain\\". Nisaba, the goddess of scribes, appears and writes down Ninurta's victory, as well as Ninhursag's new name. Finally, Ninurta returns home to Nippur, where he is celebrated as a hero. This myth combines Ninurta's role as a warrior deity with his role as an agricultural deity. The title Lugal-e means \\"O king!\\" and comes from the poem opening phrase in the original Sumerian. Ninurta's Exploits is a modern title assigned to it by scholars. The poem was eventually translated into Akkadian after Sumerian became regarded as too difficult to understand. A companion work to the Lugal-e is Angim dimma, or Ninurta's Return to Nippur, which describes Ninurta's return to Nippur after slaying Asag. It contains little narrative and is mostly a praise piece, describing Ninurta in larger-than-life terms and comparing him to the god An. Angim dimma is believed to have originally been written in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112 ‚Äì 2004 BC) or the early Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 ‚Äì 1531 BC), but the oldest surviving texts of it date to Old Babylonian Period. Numerous later versions of the text have also survived. It was translated into Akkadian during the Middle Babylonian Period ( 1600 ‚Äî 1155 BC). = Anz√ª myth = Ninurta with his thunderbolts pursues Anz√ª, who has stolen the Tablet of Destinies from Enlil's sanctuary (Austen Henry Layard Monuments of Nineveh, 2nd Series, 1853) In the Old, Middle, and Late Babylonian myth of Anz√ª and the Tablet of Destinies, the Anz√ª is a giant, monstrous bird. Enlil gives Anz√ª a position as the guardian of his sanctuary, but Anz√ª betrays Enlil and steals the Tablet of Destinies, a sacred clay tablet belonging to Enlil that grants him his authority, while Enlil is preparing for his bath. The rivers dry up and the gods are stripped of their powers. The gods send Adad, Gerra, and Shara to defeat the Anz√ª, but all of them fail. Finally, the god Ea proposes that the gods should send Ninurta, Enlil's son. Ninurta confronts the Anz√ª and shoots it with his arrows, but the Tablet of Destinies has the power to reverse time and the Anz√ª uses this power to make Ninurta's arrows fall apart in midair and revert to their original components: the shafts turn back into canebrake, the feathers into live birds, and the arrowheads return to the quarry. Even Ninurta's bow returns to the forest and the wool bowstring turns into a live sheep. Ninurta calls upon the south wind for aid, which rips the Anz√ª's wings off. Ninurta slits the Anz√ª's throat and takes the Tablet of Destinies. The god Dagan announces Ninurta's victory in the assembly of the gods and, as a reward, Ninurta is granted a prominent seat on the council. Enlil sends the messenger god Birdu to request Ninurta to return the Tablet of Destinies. Ninurta's reply to Birdu is fragmentary, but it is possible he may initially refuse to return the Tablet. In the end, however, Ninurta does return the Tablet of Destinies to his father. This story was particularly popular among scholars of the Assyrian royal court. The myth of Ninurta and the Turtle, recorded in UET 6/1 2, is a fragment of what was originally a much longer literary composition. In it, after defeating the Anz√ª, Ninurta is honored by Enki in Eridu. Ninurta has brought back a chicklet from the Anz√ª, for which Enki praises him. Ninurta, however, hungry for power and even greater accolades, \\"set[s] his sights on the whole world. Enki senses his thoughts and creates a giant turtle, which he releases behind Ninurta and which bites the hero's ankle. As they struggle, the turtle digs a pit with its claws, which both of them fall into. Enki gloats over Ninurta's defeat. The end of the story is missing; the last legible portion of the account is a lamentation from Ninurta's mother Ninmah, who seems to be considering finding a substitute for her son. According to Charles Penglase, in this account, Enki is clearly intended as the hero and his successful foiling of Ninurta's plot to seize power for himself is intended as a demonstration of Enki's supreme wisdom and cunning. = Other myths = Sumerian cylinder seal impression dating to 3200 BC, showing an ensi and his acolyte feeding a sacred herd. Ninurta was an agricultural deity and, in a poem known as the \\"Sumerian Georgica\\", he offers detailed advice on farming. In Ninurta's Journey to Eridu, Ninurta leaves the Ekur temple in Nippur and travels to the Abzu in Eridu, led by an unnamed guide. In Eridu, Ninurta sits in assembly with the gods An and Enki and Enki gives him the me for life. The poem ends with Ninurta returning to Nippur. The account probably deals with a journey in which Ninurta's cult statue was transported from one city to another and the \\"guide\\" is the person carrying the cult statue. The story closely resembles the other Sumerian myth of Inanna and Enki, in which the goddess Inanna journeys to Eridu and receives the mes from Enki. In a poem known as the \\"Sumerian Georgica\\", written sometime between 1700 and 1500 BC, Ninurta delivers detailed advice on agricultural matters, including how to plant, tend, and harvest crops, how to prepare fields for planting, and even how to drive birds away from the crops. The poem covers nearly every aspect of farm life throughout the course of the year. Though the poem starts out seeming as though the advice is being given from a father to his son, at the end, it concludes with the words: \\"These are the instructions of Ninurta, son of Enlil. O Ninurta, trustworthy farmer of Enlil, your praise is good.\\" The \\"father\\" at the beginning of the poem is thereby revealed to be Ninurta himself. The myth of the Slain Heroes is alluded to in many texts, but is never preserved in full. In this myth, Ninurta must fight a variety of opponents. Black and Green describe these opponents as \\"bizarre minor deities\\"; they include the six-headed Wild Ram, the Palm Tree King, and the seven-headed serpent. Some of these foes are inanimate objects, such as the Magillum Boat, which carries the souls of the dead to the Underworld, and the strong copper, which represents a metal that was conceived as precious. This story of successive trials and victories may have been the source for the Greek legend of the Twelve Labors of Heracles.  Later influence  =In antiquity= David Scott. Nimrod, the \\"great hunter\\" mentioned in , is believed by many scholars to be inspired by either Ninurta himself or the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I, named after him. In the late seventh century BC, Kalhu was captured by foreign invaders. Ninurta, like many other deities, had become inextricably associated with the Assyrian Empire, which was widely hated for what were perceived as cruel policies. As a result, his statues were torn down and his temples were abandoned and never restored, including his most famous one in Kalhu. Despite this, Ninurta was never completely forgotten. Most scholars agree that Ninurta was probably the inspiration for the biblical figure Nimrod, mentioned in as a \\"mighty hunter\\". Though it is still not entirely clear how the name Ninurta became Nimrod in Hebrew, the two figures bear mostly the same functions and attributes and Ninurta is currently regarded as the most plausible etymology for Nimrod's name. The city of Kalhu is specifically referenced in association with Nimrod in , where it is described as a \\"great city\\". Eventually, the ruins of the city of Kalhu itself became known in Arabic as Namr≈´d because of its association with Ninurta. Later in the Old Testament, in both and , King Sennacherib of Assyria is reported to have been murdered by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer in the temple of \\"Nisroch\\", which is most likely a scribal error for \\"Nimrod\\". This hypothetical error would result from the Hebrew letter ◊û (mem) being replacing with ◊° (samekh) and the letter ◊ì (dalet) being replaced with ◊ö (kaf). Due to the obvious visual similarities of the letters involved and the fact that no Assyrian deity by the name of \\"Nisroch\\" has ever been attested, most scholars consider this error to be the most likely explanation for the name. If \\"Nisroch\\" is Ninurta, this would make Ninurta's temple at Kalhu the most likely location of Sennacherib's murder. Other scholars have attempted to identify Nisroch as Nusku, the Assyrian god of fire. Hans Wildberger rejects all suggested identifications as linguistically implausible. Although the Book of Genesis itself portrays Nimrod positively as the first king after the Flood of Noah and a builder of cities, the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible refers to him as a giant and mistranslates the Hebrew words meaning \\"before Yahweh\\" as \\"in opposition against God.\\" Because of this, Nimrod became envisioned as the archetypal idolator. Early works of Jewish midrash, described by the first- century AD philosopher Philo in his Quaestiones, portrayed Nimrod as the instigator of the building of the Tower of Babel, who persecuted the Jewish patriarch Abraham for refusing to participate in the project. Saint Augustine of Hippo refers to Nimrod in his book The City of God as \\"a deceiver, oppressor and destroyer of earth-born creatures.\\" =In modernity= eagle- headed genius from the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu. Such depictions were widely, but erroneously, identified as Ninurta in the nineteenth century and were popularly known as \\"Nisrochs\\". In the sixteenth century, Nisroch became seen as a demon. The Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer listed Nisroch in his Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (1577) as the \\"chief cook\\" of Hell. Nisroch appears in Book VI of John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost (first published in 1667) as one of Satan's demons. Nisroch, who is described as frowning and wearing beaten armor, calls into question Satan's argument that the fight between the angels and demons is equal, objecting that they, as demons, can feel pain, which will break their morale. According to Milton scholar Roy Flannagan, Milton may have chosen to portray Nisroch as timid because he had consulted the Hebrew dictionary of C. Stephanus, which defined the name \\"Nisroch\\" as \\"Flight\\" or \\"Delicate Temptation\\". In the 1840s, the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard uncovered numerous stone carvings of winged, eagle-headed genii at Kalhu. Remembering the Biblical story of Sennacherib's murder, Layard mistakenly identified these figures as \\"Nisrochs\\". Such carvings continued to be known as \\"Nisrochs\\" in popular literature throughout the remaining portion of the nineteenth century. In Edith Nesbit's classic 1906 children's novel The Story of the Amulet, the child protagonists summon an eagle-headed \\"Nisroch\\" to guide them. Nisroch opens a portal and advises them, \\"Walk forward without fear\\" and asks, \\"Is there aught else that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?\\" Some modern works on art history still repeat the old misidentification, but Near Eastern scholars now generally refer to the \\"Nisroch\\" figure as a \\"griffin-demon\\". In 2016, during its brief conquest of the region, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) demolished Ashurnasirpal II's ziggurat of Ninurta at Kalhu. This act was in line with ISIL's longstanding policy of destroying any ancient ruins which it deemed incompatible with its militant interpretation of Islam. According to a statement from the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR)'s Cultural Heritage Initiatives, ISIL may have destroyed the temple to use its destruction for future propaganda and to demoralize the local population. In March 2020, archaeologists announced the discovery of a 5,000-year-old cultic area filled with more than 300 broken ceremonial ceramic cups, bowls, jars, animal bones and ritual processions dedicated to Ningirsu at the site of Girsu. One of the remains was a duck-shaped bronze figurine with eyes made from bark which is thought to be dedicated to Nanshe.

He also represented the southwestern wind, the bearer of storms and drought.  Iconography  Pazuzu is often depicted as a combination of diverse animal and human parts. He has the body of a man, the head of a lion or dog, talons of an eagle, two pairs of wings, a scorpion's tail and a serpentine penis. He has his right hand up and left hand down.  Mythology  Pazuzu is the demon of the southwest wind known for bringing famine during dry seasons, and locusts during rainy seasons. Pazuzu was invoked in apotropaic amulets, which combat the powers of his rival, the malicious goddess Lamashtu, who was believed to cause harm to mother and child during childbirth. Although Pazuzu is, himself, considered to be an evil spirit; he drives and frightens away other evil spirits, therefore protecting humans against plagues and misfortunes.  In modern popular culture  * In the 1971 novel The Exorcist and the film based on the novel, Pazuzu is supposedly the evil spirit that possesses the young girl Regan MacNeil. He reappears in the 1977 sequel Exorcist II: The Heretic. In this film, Pazuzu is both named as the demon antagonist of Regan and the unwitting helper of Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton), as he seeks to free Regan from the demon's grip. * William S. Burroughs invokes Pazuzu in the dedication for his novel Cities of the Red Night. * Pazuzu is mentioned in the Simon Necronomicon, a publication of Avon Books that purports to document incantations to invoke \\"incredible things, beings, and monsters into visible form\\". He is described therein as \\"Lord of all fevers and plagues, grinning Dark Angel of the Four Wings, horned, with rotting genitalia\\", and as the \\"brother of HUMWAWA\\". The book claims that he is among the most fearsome of all entities, stating in part: \\"It is the able magician indeed who can remove PAZUZU once he has laid hold of a man, for PAZUZU lays hold unto death.\\"NECRONOMICON, 1977 Avon Books, Although the book makes the claim that Pazuzu (like all entities listed therein) was of Sumerian origin, critics John Wisdom Gonce III and Daniel Harms document the erroneous nature of such a claim, stating: \\"Likewise, the demon Pazuzu does not appear in myth until Assyria's rise in the first millennium B.C., long after Sumer's prime ... Thus the beings of the Simon Necronomicon bear little resemblance to either Sumerian myth or Lovecraftian fiction.\\" * Pazuzu is the demon that allegedly haunts Ad√®le Blanc-Sec in Tardi's graphic novel The Demon of the Eiffel Tower (Le D√©mon de la tour Eiffel, 1976). Pazuzu also appears in \\"Mummies on Parade\\" (\\"Momies en folie\\", 1978).. * Pazuzu is featured in the 2014‚Äì15 NBC television series Constantine in a two-part episode \\"The Saint of Last Resorts\\". The protagonist, John Constantine, summons Pazuzu to combat Lamashtu, the primary antagonist of the first part, and later willingly allows Pazuzu to possess him to save himself from another powerful demon. However, Pazuzu has no wish to leave his new host, and emerges whenever Constantine is in danger, causing the deaths of at least eight dangerous gangbangers. Luckily, Constantine's ally Anne-Marie is able to exorcise Pazuzu by the end of the second part. * Pazuzu is a character in the 2018 novel On Devil's Wings by M. J. Meade. * The podcast The Black Tapes, episode 108, explores a demon board called the \\"Zuzu\\" or Pazuzu board, designed to summon Pazuzu to the human world. * Pazuzu (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) made an appearance in a 2017 episode of The Simpsons, \\"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII\\", possessing Homer, (briefly) Maggie (until the end) and Bart (at the end) in a spoof of The Exorcist.

It is said that pure sea salt can ban them as the salt represents incorruptible life (salt preserves, and life was first born from the sea). In Hell, they live in the Desert of Anguish, attacking newly arrived souls as they travel down the Road of Bone to the City of the Dead. The book The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria by Theophilus G. Pinches describes the Rabisu as being \\"the seizer\\" which is \\"regarded as a spirit which lay in wait to pounce upon his prey\\". Chapter 4, lines 6 and 7 of the Book of Genesis read: or in Genesis 4:7: The New American Bible among others believes that \\"Demon lurking\\", which in Hebrew means \\"the croucher\\", is similar to the word Rabisu.

(1992). The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines. Version 2016. Geneva: World Health Organization. It is classified as a sleep disorder belonging to the parasomnia family.American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing. It occurs during slow wave sleep stage, in a state of low consciousness, with performance of activities that are usually performed during a state of full consciousness. These activities can be as benign as talking, sitting up in bed, walking to a bathroom, consuming food, and cleaning, or as hazardous as cooking, driving a motor vehicle,SLEEP: Sex While Sleeping Is Real, and May Be No Joke, Michael Smith, MedPage Today Staff Writer, Published: June 19, 2006, access date 08-11-2011 violent gestures and grabbing at hallucinated objectsSwanson, Jenifer, ed. \\"Sleepwalking.\\" Sleep Disorders Sourcebook. MI: Omnigraphics, 1999. 249‚Äì254, 351‚Äì352.. Although sleepwalking cases generally consist of simple, repeated behaviors, there are occasionally reports of people performing complex behaviors while asleep, although their legitimacy is often disputed. Sleepwalkers often have little or no memory of the incident, as their consciousness has altered into a state in which memories are difficult to recall. Although their eyes are open, their expression is dim and glazed over.Lavie, Peretz, Atul Malhotra, and Giora Pillar. Sleep disorders : diagnosis, management and treatment : a handbook for clinicians. London: Martin Dunitz, 2002. 146‚Äì147. This may last from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. Sleepwalking occurs during slow-wave sleep (N3) of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep) cycles. It typically occurs within the first third of the night when slow-wave sleep is most prominent. Usually, it will occur once in a night, if at all.  Signs and symptoms Sleepwalking is characterized by: * partial arousal during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, typically during the first third of the night * dream content that may or may not be recalled when awake * dream-congruent motor behavior that may be simple or complex * impaired perception of the environment * impaired judgement, planning and problem-solving. The sleepwalker's eyes are open but may appear as a glassy- eyed stare or blank expression and pupils are dilated. They are often disoriented, consequent to awakening: the sleepwalker may be confused and perplexed, and might not know why or how they got out of bed; however, the disorientation will fade within minutes. They may talk while sleepwalking, but the talk typically does not make sense to the observer. There are varying degrees of amnesia associated with sleepwalking, ranging from no memory at all, vague memories or a narrative.Schenck, Carlos H. Sleep: The Mysteries, The Problems, and The Solutions. New York: Avery/Penguin Group, 2007. Print. =Associated disorders = In the study \\"Sleepwalking and Sleep Terrors in Prepubertal Children\\" it was found that, if a child had another sleep disordersuch as restless leg syndrome (RLS) or sleep-disorder breathing (SDB)there was a greater chance of sleepwalking. The study found that children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive polysomnographies, discrete patterns (e.g., nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high or slow EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula or pressure transducer system or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement. Sleepwalking may also accompany the related phenomenon of night terrors, especially in children. In the midst of a night terror, the affected person may wander in a distressed state while still asleep, and examples of sufferers attempting to run or aggressively defend themselves during these incidents have been reported in medical literature. In some cases, sleepwalking in adults may be a symptom of a psychological disorder. One study suggests higher levels of dissociation in adult sleepwalkers, since test subjects scored unusually high on the hysteria portion of the \\"Crown-Crisp Experiential Index\\". Another suggested that \\"A higher incidence [of sleepwalking events] has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, hysteria and anxiety neuroses\\".Orme, J.E. (1967), \\"The Incidence of Sleepwalking in Various Groups\\", Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, Vol 43, Iss 3, pp 279‚Äì28. Also, patients with migraine headaches or Tourette syndrome are 4‚Äì6 times more likely to sleepwalk. =Consequences= Most sleepwalkers had injuries at some point during sleepwalking, often minor injuries such as cuts or bruises.Milliet N, Ummenhofer W. Somnambulism and trauma: case report and short review of the literature. J Trauma. 1999;47(2):420‚Äì2Sillesen NH, Nielsen LT, Bonde C. Complex injuries associated with somnambulism. Ugeskr Laeger. 2010;172(50):3489‚Äì90 In rare occasions, however, sleepwalkers have fractured bones and died as the result of a fall. Sleepwalkers may also face embarrassment of being found naked in public. Causes The cause of sleepwalking is unknown. A number of, as yet unproven, hypotheses are suggested for why it might occur, including: delay in the maturity of the central nervous system, increased slow wave sleep,Pressman. \\"Factors that predispose, prime and precipitate NREM parasomnias in adults: clinical and forensic implications.\\" Sleep Med Rev 11.1 (2007):5‚Äì30. sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. There may be a genetic component to sleepwalking. One study found that sleepwalking occurred in 45% of children who have one parent who sleepwalked, and in 60% of children if both parents sleepwalked. Thus, heritable factors may predispose an individual to sleepwalking, but expression of the behavior may also be influenced by environmental factors. Genetic studies using common fruit flies as experimental models reveal a link between night sleep and brain development mediated by evolutionary conserved transcription factors such as AP-2 Sleepwalking may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance. Genome-wide multipoint parametric linkage analysis for sleepwalking revealed a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 3.14 at chromosome 20q12-q13.12 between 55.6 and 61.4 cM.\\"Neurology\\" Journal, January 4, 2011 76:12-13 published by the American Academy of Neurology www.Neurology.org Sleepwalking has been hypothesized to be linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which also appears to be metabolized differently in migraine patients and people with Tourette syndrome, both populations being four to nine times more likely to experience an episode of sleepwalking. Hormonal fluctuations have been found to contribute to sleepwalking episodes in women, with the likeliness to sleepwalk being higher before the onset of menstruation.Schenck, C. H., & Mahowald, M. W. (1995b). Two cases of premenstrual sleep terrors and injurious sleep-walking. Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics & Gynecology, 16, 79‚Äì84. It also appears that hormonal changes during pregnancy decrease the likelihood of engaging in sleepwalking Hedman, C., Pohjasvaara, T., Tolonen, U., Salmivaara, A., & Myllyla, V. (2002). Parasomnias decline during pregnancy. Acta Neurologica Scandinavica, 105, 209‚Äì214. Medications, primarily in four classes‚Äîbenzodiazepine receptor agonists and other GABA modulators, antidepressants and other serotonergic agents, antipsychotics, and Œ≤-blockers‚Äî have been associated with sleepwalking. The best evidence of medications causing sleepwalking is for Zolpidem and sodium oxybate‚Äîall other reports are based on associations noted in case reports. A number of conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, are thought to trigger sleepwalking in people without a previous history of sleepwalking. Diagnosis Polysomnography is the only accurate assessment of a sleepwalking episode. Because this is costly and sleepwalking episodes are usually infrequent, other measures commonly used include self-, parent-, or partner-report. Three common diagnostic systems that are generally used for sleepwalking disorders are International Classification of Diseases, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3,American Academy of Sleep Medicine. (2014). International Classification of Sleep Disorders ‚Äì Third Edition (ICSD-3). Author. and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Sleepwalking should not be confused with alcohol- or drug-induced blackouts, which can result in amnesia for events similar to sleepwalking. During an alcohol-induced blackout (drug-related amnesia), a person is able to actively engage and respond to their environment (e.g. having conversations or driving a vehicle), however the brain does not create memories for the events. Alcohol-induced blackouts can occur with blood alcohol levels higher than 0.06g/dl. A systematic review of the literature found that approximately 50% of drinkers have experienced memory loss during a drinking episode and have had associated negative consequences similar to sleepwalkers, including injury and death. Other differential diagnoses include Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, confusional arousals, and night terrors. There are two subcategories of sleepwalking: * sleepwalking with sleep-related eating. * sleepwalking with sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia). Sleep eating involves consuming food while asleep. These sleep eating disorders are more often than not induced for stress related reasons. Another major cause of this sleep eating subtype of sleepwalking is sleep medication, such as Ambien for example (Mayo Clinic). There are a few others, but Ambien is a more widely used sleep aid. Because many sleep eaters prepare the food they consume, there are risks involving burns and such with ovens and other appliances. As expected, weight gain is also a common outcome of this disorder, because food that is frequently consumed contains high carbohydrates. As with sleepwalking, there are ways that sleep eating disorders can be maintained. There are some medications that calm the sleeper so they can get longer and better-quality rest, but activities such as yoga can also be introduced to reduce the stress and anxiety causing the action. = Assessment = An assessment of sleepwalking via polysomnography poses the problem that sleepwalking is less likely to occur in the sleep laboratory, and if an episode occurs, it is usually less complex than what the patient experiences at home.Blatt, I., Peled, R., Gadoth, N., & Lavie, P. (1991). The value of sleep recording in evaluating somnambulism in young adults. Electroencephalography & Clinical Neurophysiology, 78, 407‚Äì412.Joncas, S., Zadra, A., Paquet, J., & Montplaisir, J.

J., 2nd, Charney, D. S., & Schweitzer, P. K. (1980). Somnambulism. Clinical characteristics and personality patterns. Archives of General Psychiatry, 37, 1406‚Äì1410. Therefore, the diagnosis can often be made by assessment of sleep history, time-course and content of the sleep related behaviors.Hublin, C., Kaprio, J., Partinen, M., Heikkila, K., & Koskenvuo, M. (1997). Prevalence and genetics of sleepwalking: A population-based twin study. Neurology, 48, 177‚Äì181. Sometimes, home videos can provide additional information and should be considered in the diagnostic process.Kavey, N. B., Whyte, J., Resor, S. R., Jr., & Gidro-Frank, S. (1990). Somnambulism in adults. Neurology, 40, 749‚Äì752. Some features that should always be assessed include: ‚Ä¢ Age of onset ‚Ä¢ When the episode occurs during the sleep period ‚Ä¢ How often these episodes occur (frequency) and how long they last (duration) ‚Ä¢ Description of the episode, including behavior, emotions, and thoughts during and after the event ‚Ä¢ How responsive the patient is to external stimuli during the episode ‚Ä¢ How conscious or aware the patient is, when awakened from an episode ‚Ä¢ If the episode is remembered afterwards ‚Ä¢ The triggers or precipitating factors ‚Ä¢ Sleep‚Äìwake pattern and sleep environment ‚Ä¢ Daytime sleepiness ‚Ä¢ Other sleep disorders that might be present ‚Ä¢ Family history for NREM parasomnias and other sleep disorders ‚Ä¢ Medical, psychiatric, and neurological history ‚Ä¢ Medication and substance use history Treatment There have been no clinical trials to show that any psychological or pharmacological intervention is effective in preventing sleepwalking episodes. Despite this, a wide range of treatments have been used with sleepwalkers. Psychological interventions have included psychoanalysis, hypnosis, scheduled or anticipatory waking, assertion training, relaxation training, managing aggressive feelings, sleep hygiene, classical conditioning (including electric shock), and play therapy. Pharmacological treatments have included an anticholinergic (biperiden), antiepileptics (carbamazepine, valproate), an antipsychotic (quetiapine), benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, imipramine, and triazolam), melatonin, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine), a barbiturate (sodium amytal) and herbs. There is no evidence to show that waking sleepwalkers is harmful or not, though the sleepwalker is likely to be disoriented if awakened as sleepwalking occurs during the deepest stage of sleep. Unlike other sleep disorders, sleepwalking is not associated with daytime behavioral or emotional problems. This may be because the sleepwalker's sleep is not disturbed‚Äîunless they are woken, they are still in a sleep state while sleepwalking. Maintaining the safety of the sleepwalker and others and seeking treatment for other sleep problems is recommended. Reassurance is recommended if sleepwalking is not causing any problems. However, if it causes distress or there is risk of harm, hypnosis and scheduled waking are recommended as treatments. Safety planning For those whose sleepwalking episodes turn to be hazardous, a door alarm may offer a measure of protection. There are various kinds of door alarms that can attach to a bedroom door and when the door is opened, the alarm sounds.e.g., https://ilcaustralia.org.au/search_category_paths/636 The intention is that the sound will fully awaken the person and interrupt the sleepwalking episode, or if the sleepwalker lives with others, the sound will prompt them to check on the person. Sleepwalkers should aim to have their bedrooms on the ground floor of a home, apartment, dorm, hotel, etc. Sleepwalkers should not have easily accessible weapons (loaded guns, knives) in the bedroom or any room of the house for that matter. If there are weapons, they should be locked away with keys secluded from the sleepwalker. For partners of sleepwalkers who are violent or disturb their sleep, sleeping in another room may lead to better sleep quality and quantity. Epidemiology The lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking is estimated to be 4.6%‚Äì10.3%. A meta-analysis of 51 studies, that included more than 100,000 children and adults, found that sleepwalking is more common in children with an estimated 5%, compared with 1.5% of adults, sleepwalking at least once in the previous 12 months. The rate of sleepwalking has not been found to vary across ages during childhood. History Sleepwalking has attracted a sense of mystery, but was not seriously investigated and diagnosed until the 19th century. The German chemist and parapsychologist Baron Karl Ludwig von Reichenbach (1788‚Äì1869) made extensive studies of sleepwalkers and used his discoveries to formulate his theory of the Odic force.Kushida, Clete. 2012. Encyclopedia of Sleep.. Academic Press. p. 155. . Sleepwalking was initially thought to be a dreamer acting out a dream. For example, in one study published by the Society for Science & the Public in 1954, this was the conclusion: \\"Repression of hostile feelings against the father caused the patients to react by acting out in a dream world with sleepwalking, the distorted fantasies they had about all authoritarian figures, such as fathers, officers and stern superiors.\\"Society for Science & the Public. \\"Sleepwalking Cause.\\" The Science News-Letter. 27 February 1954: 132. This same group published an article twelve years later with a new conclusion: \\"Sleepwalking, contrary to most belief, apparently has little to do with dreaming. In fact, it occurs when the sleeper is enjoying his most oblivious, deepest sleep‚Äîa stage in which dreams are not usually reported.\\"Society for Science & the Public. \\"Sleepwalker Not Dreaming.\\" The Science News-Letter, 25 June 1966: 508 More recent research has discovered that sleepwalking is actually a disorder of NREM (non-rapid eye movement) arousal. Acting out a dream is the basis for a REM (rapid eye movement) sleep disorder called REM Behavior Disorder (or REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, RSBD). More accurate data about sleep is due to the invention of technologies, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) by Hans Berger in 1924 and BEAM by Frank Duffy in the early 1980s.\\"Electroencephalography\\", Medical Discoveries, 2009. In 1907, Sigmund Freud spoke about sleepwalking to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (Nunberg and Federn). He believed that sleepwalking was connected to fulfilling sexual wishes and was surprised that a person could move without interrupting their dream. At that time, Freud suggested that the essence of this phenomenon was the desire to go to sleep in the same area as the individual had slept in childhood. Ten years later, he speculated about somnambulism in the article \\"A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams\\" (1916‚Äì17 [1915]). In this essay, he started to clarify and expand his hypothetical ideas on dreams. The dreams is a fragile equilibrium that is only partially successful because the repressed unconscious impulses of the unconscious system. This does not obey the wishes of the ego and maintain their countercathexis. Another reason why dreams are partially successful is because certain preconscious daytime thoughts can be resistant and these can retain a part of their cathexis as well. It is probable how unconscious impulses and day residues can come together and result in a conflict. Freud then wondered about the outcome of this wishful impulse, which represents an unconscious instinctual demand and then it becomes a dream wish in the preconscious. Furthermore, Freud stated that this unconscious impulse could be expressed as mobility during sleep. This would be what is observed in somnambulism, though what actually makes it possible remains unknown. Society and culture =Opera= Amina, the somnabuliste, at the mill. Vincenzo Bellini's 1831 Italian opera semiseria, La sonnambula, the plot of which is centered on the question of the innocence of the betrothed and soon- to-be married Amina, who, upon having been discovered in the bedchamber of a stranger, and despite the assurances of that stranger that Amina was entirely innocent, has been rejected by her enraged fianc√©, Elvino ‚Äî who, then, decides to marry another. In fact, when stressed, Amina was susceptible to somnambulism; and had come to be in the stranger's bedchamber by sleep-walking along a high parapet (in full view of the opera's audience). Elvino, who later observes the (exhausted by all the fuss) Amina, sleep-walking across a very high, very unstable, and very rickety bridge at the local mill, realizes his mistake, abandons his plans of marriage to the other woman, and re-unites with Amina. Jenny Lind and James Braid In August 1847, the famous soprano Jenny Lind visited Manchester, and gave two performances as Amina. The outstanding difference between Lind and her contemporaries was that, \\"whilst the beauty of her voice was far greater than any other in living memory (thus, the Swedish Nightingale), what really set her apart was her outstanding ability to act\\"; and, moreover, in performing as Amina, rather than walking along a wide and well-protected walkway (as the others did), she routinely acrobatically balanced her way along narrow planks.Yeates, L.B., James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist, Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013.

It is while sleepwalking that Count Dracula lures and attacks her. =Sleepwalking as a legal defense= Sleepwalking can sometimes result in injury, assault, or the death of someone else. Because these sleepwalking behaviours occur without volition, sleepwalking can be used as a legal defense. Alternative explanations, such as malingering and alcohol and drug-induced amnesia, need to be excluded. The differential diagnosis may also include other conditions in which violence related to sleep is a risk, such as REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RSBD), fugue states, and episodic wandering.\\"Culebras, Antonio. \\"Somnambulism.\\" Clinical Handbook of Sleep Disorders, Massachusetts: Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996. 317‚Äì319. In the 1963 case Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, Lord Morris stated, \\"Each set of facts must require a careful examination of its own circumstances, but if by way of taking an illustration it were considered possible for a person to walk in his sleep and to commit a violent crime while genuinely unconscious, then such a person would not be criminally liable for that act.\\" In the case of the law, an individual can be accused of non-insane automatism or insane automatism. The first is used as a defense for temporary insanity or involuntary conduct, resulting in acquittal. The latter results in a \\"special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.\\"Canadian Legal Information Institute. R v. Parks. 1992. This verdict of insanity can result in a court order to attend a mental institution.Lederman, Eliezer. \\"Non-Insane and Insane Automatism: Reducing the Significance of a Problematic Distinction.\\" The International and Comparative Law Quarterly 34.4 (1985): 819. Other examples of legal cases involving sleepwalking in the defense include: * 1846, Albert Tirrell used sleepwalking as a defense against charges of murdering Maria Bickford, a prostitute living in a Boston brothel. * 1981, Steven Steinberg, of Scottsdale, Arizona was accused of killing his wife and acquitted on the grounds of temporary insanity.Martin, Lawrence. \\"Can sleepwalking be a murder defense?\\", 2009. * 1991, R v Burgess: Burgess was accused of hitting his girlfriend on the head with a wine bottle and then a video tape recorder.

He is sometimes numbered the 2nd Duke of Somerset, because the title was re- created for his father after his uncle died. He also held the subsidiary titles of 5th Earl of Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Dorset and 2nd Earl of Dorset. Biography Somerset, born about January 1436, was the son of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and Eleanor, daughter of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and widow of Thomas, fourteenth baron Roos of Hamlake. From 1443 to 1448 Henry was styled Earl of Mortain or Morteign, and from 1448 to 1455 Earl of Dorset. While still a youth he fought at the First Battle of St Albans (1455), where he was wounded and his father was killed; thereby he inherited the title of 3rd Duke of Somerset. He was regarded as \\"the hope of the [Lancastrian] party\\", cites Ramsay. but he also inherited the \\"enmities entailed upon him by his father's name\\". cites Stubbs, iii. 171. He was brought to the council at Coventry, where in October 1456 an effort was made to reconcile the two parties; but the meeting was disturbed by quarrels between Somerset and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and by a brawl between Somerset's men and the town watch of Coventry. In 1457 Queen Margaret of Anjou suggested a marriage between Somerset and his cousin Joan, sister of James II of Scotland, but the proposal came to nothing. On 14 October of that year Somerset was made lieutenant of the Isle of Wight and warden of Carisbrooke Castle. Early in 1458 he took part in the council at London which again endeavoured to effect a political reconciliation, and it was agreed that Richard, Duke of York should pay the widowed Duchess of Somerset and her children an annual pension of five thousand marks as compensation for the death of the 2nd Duke. He then participated in The Love Day with the King, Queen and other leading nobles. The truce, however, was hollow; Margaret continued to intrigue against York, and in October 1458 proposed that Somerset should be appointed captain of Calais in place of Warwick. War broke out in 1459, and Somerset nearly encountered Warwick at Coleshill just before the Battle of Blore Heath. After the defeat of the Yorkists at Ludford Bridge, he was on 9 October nominated captain of Calais. He crossed the Channel and was refused admittance to Calais by Warwick's adherents, but made himself master of the outlying fortress of Guisnes (appointing Andrew Trollope its bailiff). Somerset fought several skirmishes with the Yorkists between Calais and Guisnes until on 23 April 1460 he suffered a decisive reverse at the Battle of Newnham Bridge (called Pont de Neullay by the French). cites W. Worcester, p. 479; Chron. ed. Davies, p. 84; Hall, p. 206. During his absence the Yorkists had won the Battle of Northampton, but Somerset joined the Lancastrians at Pontefract in December 1460, captured a portion of the Yorkist forces at Worksop on 21 December, and won the Lancastrian victory at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December. He marched south with Margaret and fought at the Second Battle of St Albans (17 February 1461). This second victory was not followed up; the Lancastrians retired north, and on 29 March Edward IV won the Battle of Towton (29 March 1461). Somerset escaped from the battlefield, and in the following July was sent by Margaret to seek aid from Charles VII of France. Charles died before their arrival, but Louis XI summoned Somerset to Tours and sent him back in March 1462 laden with promises of support, but with very little else. Somerset now began to consider making his peace with Edward IV. He had been attainted by parliament on 4 November 1461, and most of his lands had been granted to Edward's brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester and other Yorkists. cites Cal. Patent Rolls, 1461-5, pp. 29, 32; Stubbs, iii. 1960. On his return from France he took command of the Lancastrian forces in Scotland while Margaret went to France, and in the autumn of 1462 he was holding Bamburgh Castle for the Lancastrians. On 24 December, however, he surrendered the castle to Sir Ralph Percy and submitted to King Edward. The king took him to London, and treated him with marked favour. He received a general pardon on 10 March 1462/1463, cites Cal. Patent Rolls. 1461-5, p. 261. and was restored to his dignities by act of the parliament which met on 29 April following. cites Rot. Parl. v. 511. Somerset, however, soon returned to his old allegiance. Early in 1464 he escaped from Holt Castle in North Wales, where he seems to have been kept in some sort of confinement, and after nearly being recaptured made his way to Margaret on the borders. The Lancastrians now made one more effort to recover the crown, but at the Battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464 they were utterly defeated by John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. Somerset was captured in a barn at the site of what is now known as Dukes House, and beheaded shortly afterwards that same day. He was buried at Hexham Abbey. Parliament annulled the act restoring him to his dignities, which again became forfeit and were never restored. Somerset was unmarried, and his younger brother, Edmund Beaufort, was styled 4th Duke of Somerset by the Lancastrians. In 1485, some twenty-one years after his death, Somerset, along with Jasper Tudor, had all acts of attainder against him annulled in the first Parliament of Henry VII, \\"for their true and faithfull Allegeaunces and Services doune to the said blessed King Herrie [VI].\\" Character Somerset was described by Chastellain as \\"un tr√®s grand seigneur et un des plus beaulx josnes chevaliers qui fust au royaume anglais\\" (\\"A very great lord and one of the most handsome knights in the English kingdom\\"). He was probably as competent as any of the Lancastrian leaders, but their military capacity was not great. Illegitimate progeny By his mistress Joan Hill he had an illegitimate son: *Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, 1st Baron Herbert (c.1460-1526), KG, who was given the surname \\"Somerset\\" and was created Baron Herbert in 1506 and Earl of Worcester in 1513. From him descend the Earls and Marquesses of Worcester and the Dukes of Beaufort, who are the last known surviving male-line descendants of King Henry II (1154-1189) of England, Count of Anjou, founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, of which King Richard III (1483-1485) was the last ruling member in the male line.

The attractions reflect elements from ancient myths and legends, fairy tales, fables, and folklore. The park was opened on May 31, 1952. It evolved from a nature park with a playground and a Fairytale Forest into a full-sized theme park. It now caters to both children and adults with its cultural, romantic, and nostalgic themes, in addition to its wide array of amusement rides including six roller coasters. It is the largest theme park in the Netherlands and one of the oldest theme parks in the world. It is twice as large as the original Disneyland park in California and predates it by three years. Annually, the park has more than 5 million visitors. In 2019, it was the third most visited theme park in Europe, behind Disneyland Paris and Europa-Park.  History  Paper gobbler Hollow Bulging Gijs - classic Pieck design Efteling is one of the oldest theme parks still in existence. Its roots go back to 1935, when the R. K. Sport en Wandelpark was inaugurated. In 1950, Efteling Nature Park Foundation (Stichting Natuurpark de Efteling) was founded by the mayor of Loon op Zand, R.J. van der Heijden, filmmaker Peter Reijnders, and designer artist Anton Pieck (1895-1987). The foundation was named after a 16th-century farm named Ersteling. Efteling officially opened on May 31, 1952, when the Fairy Tale Forest (het Sprookjesbos), designed by the famous Dutch illustrator Anton Pieck, was opened to the public. Initially, the Fairy Tale Forest was home to some 10 different fairy tales, all of them brought to life using original drawings by Pieck alongside mechanics, lighting and sound effects designed by the Dutch filmmaker Peter Reijnders. The life-sized dioramas, displayed together in an atmospheric forest, was an enormous success. In 1952 alone, Efteling welcomed 240,000 visitors. Since 1978, the park has been expanded and grown to become one of the most popular theme parks in the world. In the same year, English singer Kate Bush performed in the park in De Efteling Special, which was broadcast on 11 May 1978. In early 1978, the amusement park's Haunted Castle was completed and the opening was scheduled on 10 May that year. Bush, who just had a big hit in the Netherlands with \\"Wuthering Heights\\", made her debut on Dutch television in the special. Her popularity was used to draw the attention to the Haunted Castle. The Dutch climate and the integral role of natural greenery in the park's appearance prevented the opening of the park year-round. In 2010, Efteling announced plans to remain open year-round. From November through about February, the 'Winter Efteling' theme remains in place. However, attractions which involve water, such as the rapids ride 'Pira√±a' or the water coaster 'Vliegende Hollander' (Flying Dutchman), are closed. Gisela Williams, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, wrote a review of the park in early 2014. Williams praised Efteling but criticized the teacups-style ride Monsieur Cannibale due to ethnic stereotypes. Her review was later mentioned in De Telegraaf, a daily newspaper in the Netherlands. In recent years, activists have repeatedly requested the Efteling to remove or re-theme the attraction. The park received its 123,456,789th guest on June 19, 2015. The Efteling opened the trackless darkride Symbolica in 2019. With a price tag of 35 million euro, it is the most expensive investment in Efteling history. Beside the theme park, the Efteling operates two hotels, a theatre, a golf course, and two holiday villages. The Efteling inaugurated its 30th fairytale in 2019.  Design  Efteling Theater - typical Van de Ven design Baron 1898 - Newly built dive coaster The success of Efteling has been attributed largely to its ride designs, architecture and atmosphere. When Anton Pieck was asked to design the initial fairy tales for the Efteling, he made sure the park would live up to his personal high standards. There would be no use of cheap building materials, plastic, or concrete. Pieck's illustration style, somewhat grim and dark, but also romantic and nostalgic, was the thematic base on which nearly all future expansions were built. Pieck worked for Efteling until the mid-1970s, when his position as chief designer was passed on to the younger Ton van de Ven. Van de Ven had already been working for Efteling for several years and Pieck was very pleased with his work. The Haunted Castle (het Spookslot), which opened in 1978 as the park's first new large attraction, was Efteling's first to be designed entirely by Van de Ven. Van de Ven continued his work until 2002, when he retired. A new team of imagineers works on new Efteling attractions, still in a style suitable to the Efteling.  Divisions  The Efteling Theme Park Resort now comprises several divisions: the theme park (1952), the four-star Efteling Hotel (1992), the 18-hole golf course (1995), Efteling Theatre (2002), accommodation parks: Efteling Bosrijk (2009) & Het Loonsche Land (2017). The theatre, which was once used for park shows, is one of the five biggest theatres in the Netherlands and can house big theatre productions, which will not be included in park admissions. Besides using it as a home base for shows/musicals created by the Efteling itself (like \\"Droomvlucht\\") it also lends itself out for other big productions, events, and business events. The hotel was operated by Golden Tulip for several years, but Efteling decided in 2004 to manage it independently. All divisions are now profitable, although it took the golf course several years to break even. The divisions are each contained in commercial corporations, but all shares are still held by the nonprofit Efteling Nature Park Foundation (Stichting Natuurpark de Efteling).  The park  Gondoletta and Pagode Latest attraction: Symbolica Palace of Fantasy The theme park covers . This area has changed only marginally over the course of its history. The Efteling Theme Park Resort also offers the Efteling hotel, the Efteling hotel Loonsche Land, a theatre, a golf course, Villa Pardoes, and two holiday villages (Efteling Bosrijk and Efteling Loonsche Land) on . The park's foundation owns a total of also including young forest, nature reserve, some grassland, fields and roads. The park is divided into five themed areas or 'realms'. Originally, the park was divided into four areas called North, West, East, and South, with most of the park's historical rides and attractions, such as the Fairy Tale Forest, located in West. When the park reorganized its infrastructure in the late 1990s, adding the Pardoes Promenade (named after Efteling's mascot Pardoes, a court jester) and a central hub called Efteling Brink, it also changed the areas' names. North was changed to Reizenrijk (Travel Realm), West became Marerijk (Fairy Realm), East became Ruigrijk (Adventure Realm), and South became Anderrijk (Other Realm). In 2017 a fifth realm opened in the center of the park called Fantasierijk (Fantasy Realm). Although the park was not built with these divisions in mind and the names may seem cryptic, they do make sense. Perhaps the area most suited to its name is Ruigrijk, where most fast rides such as the double-loop roller coaster Python (constructed in 1981) are located. Marerijk is the home to the Fairy Tale Forest and the Fairies of the Droomvlucht, Anderrijk has some rides that are inspired by non-Western cultures (e.g. Fata Morgana and Pira√±a), while Reizenrijk has the Carnaval Festival ride, which travels through several different 'countries'. The Fantasierijk got its name from the darkride Symbolica: Palace of Fantasy. Efteling was largely built in an existing pine forest located in a rural area, giving it a 'nature park' feeling. Together with its large ponds and gardens, its abundant green space is rather unusual among the world's leading theme parks.

As a token of appreciation, the Disney Company gave Efteling a small statue. Ton van de Ven, who designed many of Efteling's attractions, was also a good friend of Disney's Tony Baxter (senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering). The relationship between the two parks was emphasized when Efteling won the 2004 Thea Classic Award, the highest honor awarded by the Themed Entertainment Association: Efteling had, as it turned out, been nominated by Tony Baxter. Also, a popular legend further links Disney and Efteling. For years, rumors have circulated that Walt Disney derived his inspiration for Disneyland (which opened in 1955), from Efteling (which opened in 1952). According to the legend, in the early 1950s, Walt Disney traveled to Europe a few times and visited several tourist attractions. Reportedly, a brochure from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions even states that Disney \\"spent a great deal of time studying Pieck's work at Efteling before beginning his own park.\\" However, the rumor was later discredited by Efteling. An off-hand remark by a PR person for Efteling during a presentation for a group of reporters further extend the legend's longevity. Disney likely never actually visited Efteling, though he did visit Madurodam and Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. The latter actually did provide some inspiration for Disneyland.

It was also a chain of restaurants for over 90 years and widely known for that alone. Founded by Howard Deering Johnson, it was the largest restaurant chain in the U.S. throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with more than 1,000 combined company-owned and franchised outlets. Howard Johnson hotels and motels are now part of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. Howard Johnson's restaurants were franchised separately from the hotel brand beginning in 1986, but in the years that followed, severely dwindled in number and all but disappeared by the turn of the century. As of 2016, only one Howard Johnson's restaurant remains: in Lake George, New York. The food and beverage rights to the restaurant are currently owned by Wyndham Worldwide. The line of branded supermarket frozen foods, including ice cream, is no longer manufactured. , it has 322 locations with 41,688 rooms.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1722684/000172268420000007/wh-20191231x10k.htm  History  = Early years = In 1925, Howard Deering Johnson borrowed $2,000 to buy and operate a small corner pharmacy in Wollaston, a neighborhood in Quincy, Massachusetts. Johnson was surprised to find it easy to pay back the money lent to him, after discovering his recently installed soda fountain had become the busiest part of his drugstore. Eager to ensure that his store would remain successful, Johnson decided to devise a new ice cream recipe. Some sources say the recipe was based on his mother's homemade ice creams and desserts, while others say that it was from a local German immigrant, who either sold or gave Johnson the ice cream recipe. The new recipe made the ice cream more flavorful due to increased butterfat content. Eventually Johnson created 28 flavors of ice cream. He is quoted as saying, \\"I thought I had every flavor in the world. That '28' (flavors of ice cream) became my trademark.\\" The baker with the pie image, the symbol representing Howard Johnson's, was sculptured by Charles Pizzano. Throughout the summers of the late 1920s, Johnson opened concession stands on beachfront property along the coast of Massachusetts. The stands sold soft drinks, hot dogs, and ice cream. Each stand was successful. With his success becoming more noticeable every year, Johnson convinced local bankers to lend him funds to operate a sit-down restaurant. Negotiations were made and, toward the end of the decade, the first Howard Johnson's restaurant opened in Quincy. It featured fried clams, baked beans, chicken pot pies, frankfurters, ice cream, and soft drinks. The first Howard Johnson's restaurant received a tremendous boost in 1929, owing to an unusual set of circumstances: The mayor of nearby Boston, Malcolm Nichols, banned the production of Eugene O'Neill's play, Strange Interlude in Boston. Rather than fight the mayor, the Theatre Guild moved the production to Quincy. The five-hour play was presented in two parts with a dinner break. The first Howard Johnson's restaurant was near the theater, and hundreds of influential Bostonians flocked to the restaurant. Through word of mouth, more Americans became familiar with the Howard Johnson Company. =Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s= Corporate logo of the Howard Johnson Company, circa World War II (1939-1945), showing a depiction of an orange-roofed restaurant, characteristic typeface, and \\"Simple Simon and the Pieman\\" logo. Howard Johnson entered the airline catering market segment. Most Howard Johnson's restaurants featured a food counter known as a \\"Dairy Bar\\" on one wing of the building, such as this Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts unit photographed in 1959. Howard Johnsons restaurant entrance with emblematic weathervane. Johnson wanted to expand his company, but the stock market crash of 1929 prevented this. After waiting a few years and maintaining his business, Johnson persuaded an acquaintance in 1932 to open a second Howard Johnson's restaurant in Orleans, Massachusetts. The second restaurant was franchised and not company-owned. This was one of America's first franchising agreements. By the end of 1936 there were 39 more franchised restaurants, creating a total of 41 Howard Johnson's restaurants. By 1939, there were 107 Howard Johnson's restaurants along American East Coast highways, generating revenues of $10.5 million. In less than 14 years, Johnson directed a franchise network of over 10,000 employees with 170 restaurants, many serving 1.5 million people a year. The unique icons of orange roofs, cupolas, and weather vanes on Howard Johnson properties helped patrons identify the chain's restaurants and motels. The restaurant's trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman logo was created by artist John Alcott in the 1930s. There were 200 Howard Johnson's restaurants when America entered World War II. By 1944, only 12 Howard Johnson's restaurants remained in business. The effects of war rationing had crippled the company. Johnson managed to maintain his business by serving commissary food to war workers and U.S. Army recruits. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike (1940), and later the Ohio Turnpike, New Jersey Turnpike and Connecticut Turnpike were built, Johnson bid for and won exclusive rights to serve drivers at service station turnoffs through the turnpike systems. In the process of recovering from these losses, in 1947 the Howard Johnson Company began construction of 200 new restaurants throughout the American Southeast and Midwest. By 1951, the sales of the Howard Johnson Company totaled $115 million. = Entering the hotel business = HoJo motor lodges used a lamplighter character lighting a lamppost with the Simple Simon character pointing to the light. By 1954, there were 400 Howard Johnson's restaurants in 32 states, about 10% of which were extremely profitable company-owned turnpike restaurants; the rest were franchises. This was one of the first nationwide restaurant chains. While many places sold \\"fried clams\\", they were whole, which was not universally accepted by the American dining public. Howard Johnson popularized Soffron Brothers Clam Company's fried clam strips, the \\"foot\\" of hard-shelled sea clams. They became popular to eat in this fashion throughout the country. In 1954, the company opened the first Howard Johnson's motor lodge in Savannah, Georgia. The company employed architects Rufus Nims and Karl Koch to oversee the design of the rooms and gate lodge. Nims had previously worked with the company, designing restaurants. The restaurant's trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman was now joined by a lamplighter character in the firm's marketing of its motels. According to cultural historians, the chain became synonymous with travel among American motorists and vacationers in part because of Johnson's ubiquitous outdoor advertising displays. In 1959, Howard Deering Johnson, who had founded and managed the company since 1925, turned control over to his son, then 26-year-old Howard Brennan Johnson. The elder Johnson observed his son's running of the company until his death in 1972 at the age of 75. Howard Johnson Company went public in 1961; there were 605 restaurants, 265 company- owned and 340 franchised, as well as 88 franchised Howard Johnson's motor lodges in 32 states and The Bahamas. In 1961, Johnson hired New York chefs Pierre Franey and Jacques P√©pin to oversee food development at the company's main commissary in Brockton, Massachusetts. Franey and P√©pin developed recipes for the company's signature dishes that could be flash frozen and delivered across the country, guaranteeing a consistent product. = Segregation and desegregation = While the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1954 struck down segregation in public schools, the segregation and maintenance of whites-only public facilities continued in other domains, including the Howard Johnson chain. Segregation in Howard Johnson's restaurants provoked an international crisis in 1957, when a Howard Johnson eatery in Dover, Delaware refused service to Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, the finance minister of Ghana, prompting a public apology from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, was instrumental in organizing protests and sit-ins at Howard Johnson locations in multiple states. The city of Durham, North Carolina, became notable as a focus for action against segregated restaurants and hotels, including Howard Johnson's. On 12 August 1962, attorney and civil rights activist Floyd McKissick initiated the first of multiple rallies and demonstrations against segregated establishments in Durham, including the Howard Johnson's restaurant on Chapel Hill Boulevard, culminating in multiple protests on 18‚Äì20 May 1963 resulting in mass arrests as well as an eventual rapprochement with the city government. Future senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, while a student at the University of Chicago in 1962, helped organize picketing of a Howard Johnson's location in Cicero, Illinois, during his time as a student activist for CORE. By 7 December 1962, the Howard Johnson Company issued a statement to the press opposing racial segregation in its restaurants, citing its corporate policy against discrimination: \\"Where it has been possible to change the operation of our company-operated restaurants in the South to conform to our national policy of service without discrimination, this has been done.\\" The letter, written in conjunction with CORE and the NAACP, praised the organizations and aligned company policy with their outlook that segregation was \\"not defensible.\\" = New chains and a changing public = In the 1930s, H.D. Johnson bought the Wayland Red Coach Grill and used it as the model for a new concept, a more upscale steakhouse restaurant chain called Red Coach Grills. While they had some success, they were not sufficiently profitable. Eventually the last 15 Red Coach Grills were sold in 1983 to a company executive who closed them. In 1969, Johnson again tried a new restaurant concept, Ground Round. It was successful. Though not a Howard Johnson's restaurant, the Ground Round chain was company-owned and -franchised, thus increasing the Howard Johnson Company profit. By 1975, the Howard Johnson Company had more than 1,000 restaurants and more than 500 motor lodges in 42 states and Canada. The company reached its peak that year, but the late 1970s marked the beginning of the end for the Howard Johnson Company. Because of the oil embargo of 1974, the Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges, which received 85% of revenue from travelers, lost profits when Americans could not afford long trips or frequent vacations. Also, the company model of serving pre-made food with high-quality ingredients in traditional dining rooms was costly when compared to the innovations introduced by fast food outlets like McDonald's, which designed its products and restaurants to appeal to families with younger children. Around this time, the chain introduced \\"Hojo Cola\\" and other private-label sodas, which disappointed some customers who preferred familiar products such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi. The company suffered from two infamous incidents at a property in the New Orleans Central Business District within 18 months of one another. The first was a July 1971 fire, set by two irate guests who had been ejected from the hotel, which killed six people. The second, in January 1973, was a harrowing day-long siege. Former Black Panther Mark Essex used the hotel's roof as a sniper's perch, killing three police officers, the hotel's general manager and assistant general manager, and a couple from Virginia, who were on a belated honeymoon. He also wounded policemen, firemen and civilians. Then, in Jericho, New York, on 8 November 1974, singer-actress Connie Francis was raped at the Jericho Turnpike Howard Johnson's Lodge. She sued the motel chain for their lapse in security and won a judgment of $2.5 million, one of the largest such judgments at that time, leading to a reform in hotel security. Her rapist was never found. H. B. Johnson attempted to streamline company operations and cut costs, such as serving cheaper food and having fewer employees. This strategy was unsuccessful, because patrons compared this new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges unfavorably to the services they had previously come to know. In a further effort to make the company more successful and profitable, Johnson created other concepts, such as HoJos Campgrounds and 3 Penny Inns for lodging, as well as Deli Baker Ice Cream Maker, and Chatt's for restaurants. All of these concepts failed, furthering the company's demise. In the late 1990s, the Howard Johnson's Candy Factory and Executive Offices in Wollaston were purchased and renovated by the Eastern Nazarene College to form the Adams Executive Center. = Changes in ownership = In 1979, Johnson accepted an acquisition bid of more than $630 million from Imperial Group PLC of London, England. Imperial obtained 1,040 restaurants (75% company owned/25% franchised) and 520 motor lodges (75% franchised/25% company owned). In 1981 Imperial recruited G. Michael Hostage, then CEO of Continental Baking Company and formerly executive vice president of Marriott Corporation, to replace Johnson as CEO. After four years, despite progress in a turnaround, Imperial reversed course and sold the company. Having declined to entertain Hostage's proposal to lead a leveraged buyout, Imperial employed Goldman Sachs who, with Hostage's assistance, sold the company to Marriott in 1986. In a contemporaneous transaction, Marriott sold the motor lodge business and the Howard Johnson trademark to Prime Motor Inns, a New Jersey company. Howard Johnson's restaurant painted in 1970s \\"environmental\\" color scheme A former Howard Johnson's restaurant in Bay City, Michigan, which closed in 2005. Note the adjacent former motor lodge, now occupied by Econo Lodge. Marriott was interested in the company-owned restaurants for the real estate. Marriott already owned Big Boy Restaurants and Roy Rogers Restaurants. In 1982, it acquired Host International, which had operated a number of highway rest stops. Many of the established Howard Johnson sites were in prime highway locations which could be profitably converted to Big Boy or various fast food banners. As Marriott quickly demolished the company owned restaurants or converted them to the Bob's Big Boy restaurant chain, the number of Howard Johnson's restaurants remaining circa 1985 was sharply reduced. Only the franchised restaurants remained untouched. Marriott left all company-owned and franchised motor lodges untouched, as the deal called for them to be sold a year later (in 1986) to Prime Motors Inns, an existing franchisee with 63 motels.  Divestment of motor lodges  Prime Motors Inns continued to preserve the lodges, just as Marriott had, until weak hotel and real estate markets caused it to sell off its assets and cease operations in 1990. Those involved with the company owned and franchised motor lodges banded together and formed the Howard Johnson Acquisition Corporation. They successfully obtained all the rights to operate and maintain the company owned and franchised lodges. With these rights maintained, they changed their name to \\"Howard Johnson International Incorporated,\\" which became a subsidiary of \\"Hospitality Franchise Systems Incorporated,\\" which eventually merged with other companies to form Cendant. In 2006, Cendant split itself into Wyndham Worldwide and three other companies. Wyndham operated the Howard Johnson brand under many \\"tiers\\" based on price, level of amenities, and services offered. Under Cendant/Wyndham, the chain became a parking place for franchise conversions, which were existing independent motels which had been renovated and added to the chain in order to provide them with access to a nationally recognised name and central reservation infrastructure. As these properties were not originally constructed as Howard Johnson sites, they lacked the distinctive architecture and some had no restaurant at all. Howard Johnson's proposed revitalization project became known as the Renew project and commenced in 2015. Howard Johnson Express Inns, Howard Johnson Inns, Howard Johnson Hotels, and Howard Johnson Plaza Hotels range from limited-service motels to full-service properties with on-site concierges and business centers. Howard Johnson began offering a \\"Rise 'N' Dine\\" continental breakfast at some economy limited service locations. The chain abolished the multiple price tiers by 2015.  Divestment of restaurant brand  While the Howard Johnson Company-owned and franchised motor lodges have stood the test of time since being sold by the Howard Johnson Company in 1979, the restaurants have not. Because Marriott eliminated all the company-owned restaurants, the owners of the franchised restaurants feared elimination and banded together in 1986 and created \\"Franchise Associates Incorporated\\" or (FAI). In 1986, Marriott gave FAI the rights to operate and maintain Howard Johnson's restaurants. When Cendant acquired the Howard Johnson's motor lodges, they offered to work together with FAI to ensure the expansion of the restaurant chain. As early as 1987, FAI chairman George Carter acknowledged that \\"We have the concept, but it desperately needs to be modernized, internally and externally. Howard Johnson was allowed to become tired and stale. We must get rid of that plastic image... Anything can be salvageable if a great deal of time and money and effort is put in it. And Howard Johnson needs all those same things.\\" Attempts were made to revamp 25% of the menu and create new signage, but these efforts proved insufficient as the long-neglected chain continued to lose ground to mass-market fast food operations. By March 1995, FAI's official restaurant directory listed 84 remaining restaurants in the US and Canada. While the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain was preserved, FAI did not have enough money to expand to new locations or revamp the brand. With the exception of one Howard Johnson's ice cream parlor in Puerto Rico, FAI never opened a new restaurant or expanded the chain. An existing restaurant in Canton, Massachusetts, was remodeled as a prototype for a new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants, but the concept failed, and after less than a decade of operation, the prototype restaurant closed in 2000. =2000s= By 2005, there were fewer than eight surviving restaurants. A combination of no vision, no reinvestment of capital, aging restaurants, a stale menu, lack of marketing or new ideas, and competition from other chains had taken their toll; restaurants were closing their doors. FAI ceased operations in 2005, the same year that the Springfield, Vermont, location and the last New York City restaurant in the chain closed. Cendant acquired the rights to operate and maintain the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants. In 2006, Cendant sold them to La Mancha Group LLC, which had proposed an aggressive expansion of the restaurant chain that never materialized. After the Waterbury, Connecticut restaurant became The Brass House Restaurant in April 2007, only three locations remained. Cendant split into four smaller companies in 2006; its hotel group became Wyndham Worldwide while other pieces were spun off separately to become Avis Budget Group, Realogy, Travelport and Affinion Group. A line of Howard Johnson-branded frozen foods disappeared from grocery stores after Fairfield Farms Kitchens shut down its Brockton, Massachusetts plant in 2006 and America's Kitchen of Atlanta, Georgia shut down in May 2008. =2010s= In spring 2012, one of the last three original Howard Johnson's restaurants closed, in Lake George, and was listed for sale. Television personality, chef and author Rachael Ray once worked at that site while living in Lake George as a teenager. By 2013 only two original restaurants remained open, but the Bangor (hotel and restaurant) no longer had the distinctive orange roof. While the highest tier in the hotel franchise (HoJo Hotel Plaza) does include a restaurant, there is no requirement that these replicate menus, format or branding of the former Howard Johnson restaurant chain. With La Mancha Group LLC no longer active, Wyndham Hotel Group now owned the rights to the HoJo's food business as well as the Howard Johnson hotel chain. In 2013, Wyndham proposed a Howard Johnson Brand Reinvigoration which would bring select flavors of ice cream back to the hotels, adopt a new logo, phase out the multiple branding tiers and give the properties a facelift and redesign as a lower-midscale chain starting in 2015. In August 2014, the Lake George restaurant regained the Howard Johnson's name when the lease was transferred from its original owners, DeSantis Enterprises, to John Larock. The restaurant reopened 10 January 2015, briefly bringing the number of locations back up to three. On 31 March 2015, the Lake Placid, N.Y., Howard Johnson's closed, leaving only two locations remaining. Then in September 2016, the Bangor restaurant closed, leaving the Lake George restaurant the very last location remaining out of the original 1,000-plus.Lake Placid HoJo's to close its doors WCAX, 24 March 2015 =Last remaining restaurant= Despite the Lake George Howard Johnson's restaurant proclaimed resilience as \\"The Last One Standing\\", its future has been put in question. In January 2017 its land went up for sale and redevelopment projects have been proposed for the site since.On October 12, 2017, owner John Larock was arrested and convicted of sexual harassment of female employees, and on October 31, 2018 began serving a six-month jail sentence.https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new- york/articles/2017-10-12/owner-of-last-hojos-restaurant-charged-with-sexual- abusehttps://www.wivb.com/top-stories/howard-johnson-owner-sentenced-for-sex- crimes/1565438128 The restaurant continues to operate with Larock as owner, but is open limited days and hours.https://www.news10.com/news/local- news/lake-george-howard-johnson-s-under-new-management-after-conviction-of- former-operator/1567008820 With all the food commissaries defunct, and no official connection with Wyndham, the restaurant operates as an independent entity. Use of the Howard Johnson's restaurant name is permitted because of a grandfather clause. Despite retaining the original building and trademark name, and with little to no connection to the former franchise, its authenticity as a true Howard Johnson's restaurant has been questioned due to its dissimilar menu and negative reviews. In popular culture In the Honeymooners 1953 episode titled \\"Hot Dog Stand\\", Ralph and Norton start their own business. On opening day they are excited to see a new building being built just down the road that could potentially bring them many customers only to later find out the new building is a Howard Johnson's. To produce the 1958 Norman Rockwell painting The Runaway, Rockwell staged the lunch counter scene at a Pittsfield, MA location. All references to the restaurant chain, including the Dairy Bar mirrors, were removed in the final piece. The film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was \\"one of the first to carry 'product placements' for companies\\" such as Howard Johnson's, whose logos appear aboard the space station. The chain's lamplighter was also updated to the \\"Earthlight Room\\" on the space station, a Howard Johnson's lounge for passengers taking the Moon shuttle. In the scene where the Russian scientists share a drink with Dr. Floyd, it is shown that the restaurant chain servicing the space station is Howard Johnson's. The chain featured a 2001 tie-in in its children's menu. A substantial portion of the Mad Men season 5 episode, \\"Far Away Places\\", involves Don and Megan Draper's trip to the Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh, New York. However, exteriors were actually shot in Baldwin Park, California. In response, Howard Johnson's launched a promotion referencing the appearance, to include a letter addressed to the character of Don Draper in the style of letterhead used in that era. In the Academy Award- winning Best Picture of 1955, Marty, Ernest Borgnine (winner of the Best Actor Oscar in the film) tries to make a date with a girl and recalls their last meeting where they had burgers and a milkshake was at Howard Johnson's. A prominent interlude in the song-story, \\"Billy the Mountain\\" from the 1972 Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention album Just Another Band from LA has Billy asking his wife Ethell, a tree growing out of his shoulder, if she wants to go to Howard Johnson's for some clams. In the 2009 movie Sunshine Cleaning, a character references eating at Howard Johnson's.https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Sunshine-Cleaning.html In the film Blazing Saddles, a joke is made of recreating the town of Rock Ridge \\"right down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse\\" and signage boasting \\"1 flavor\\". The character named Howard Johnson was played by John Hillerman. The restaurant in Westbury, New York, was featured in the 1989 film Family Business with Sean Connery and Dustin Hoffman. The hotel was featured in the 2019 filmThe Irishman. In the 1964 Hitchcock thriller Marnie, Sean Connery and Tippi Hedren were filmed arriving at and dining inside the Howard Johnson's in the Springfield Shopping Center in Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. In the 1987 episode of Married... with Children, \\"Poppy's by the Tree: Part 1\\", one of the highlights of the Bundys' road trip will be their stop at Howard Johnson's for free Pez. And at the first Howard Johnson's they stop at, the Pez is on Al. In the 1972 animated feature Fritz_the_Cat_(film) at 4:19 of this online video Winston holds a Howard Johnson's menu and orders a steak. Upon leaving, she says \\"You can always depend upon Howard Johnson's\\". That was part of the appeal of chains such as Howard Johnson's or McDonalds: every location has the same menu and the food is prepared the exact same way. It contrasts Winston's \\"playing it safe\\" vs. Fritz wanting to stop at truck stops and hear all the truckers' stories of life on the road.

Tanaquil (Etruscan Thanchvil) was the queen of Rome by marriage to Tarquinius Priscus, fifth king of Rome. Life The daughter of a powerful Etruscan family in Tarquinii, Etruria, Tanaquil thought her husband would make a good leader, but since he was the son of an immigrant, he would not be able to gain power in Tarquinii, where they lived. Knowing this, Tanaquil encouraged him to move to Rome, which was not at the time dominated by a strong local aristocracy. Her strong prophetic abilities helped her to install Tarquin as king and later Servius Tullius as the next king. While on the road to Rome, an eagle flew off with Tarquin's hat and then returned it to his head. Tanaquil interpreted this as a sign that the gods wanted him to become a king. Tanaquil's prophecy was eventually realized for Tarquin - he eventually became friends with King Ancus Marcius, who made Tarquin guardian of his children. When the king died before his children were old enough to become successors to the throne, Tarquin used his popularity in the Comitia to be elected the fifth king of Rome. He ruled from 616 to 579 BC. She had four children, two daughters and two sons, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last king of Rome, and Arruns Tarquinius, co-conspirator in the foundation of the Republic of Rome. One of her daughters, Tarquinia, married Servius Tullius after he had succeeded Tarquinius Priscus as king. Tanaquil played a role in the rise of Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome. Raising him as her own child, Tanaquil believed Servius would be the next successor to the throne. Her dreams would be realized when, one day Servius was sleeping and his head was surrounded with flames. The fires danced around his head without hurting him and when Servius awoke, the fire disappeared.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, page 1183 (v. 3) Taking this as an omen, Tanaquil knew Servius would one day be king. When Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil hid his death from her subjects, instead telling them that Tarquin had been wounded and had Servius himself appointed regent until he got better. After gaining the people's respect and commanding the kingship, Servius and Tanaquil announced Tarquin's death.Cassius Dio ‚Äî Fragments of Book 2 The Senate named Servius king and Tanaquil's son, Arruns Tarquinius, married Servius' daughter, Tullia. Gaia Caecilia In an alternate tradition reported by several Roman chroniclers, Tanaquil changed her name to Gaia Caecilia when she arrived at Rome. Under this name she was regarded as the model of womanly virtue, skilled in the domestic arts, particularly spinning and weaving, and she was associated with the origin of various Roman wedding customs.Sextus Pompeius Festus, Epitome de M. Verrio Flacco de Verborum Significatu (Epitome of Marcus Verrius Flaccus' On the Meaning of Words), s. v. Gaia Caecilia.Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder), Naturalis Historia (Natural History), viii. 74.Liber de Praenominibus, a short treatise of uncertain authorship, traditionally appended to Valerius Maximus' Factorum ac Dictorum Memorabilium (Memorable Facts and Sayings).Plutarchus, Moralia, \\"Quaestiones Romanae\\" (Roman Questions). Pliny reports that in his day, six hundred years later, her spindle and distaff were preserved in the Temple of Sancus, where stood a bronze statue of the queen, together with a purple tunic she had woven for Servius Tullius, and according to some authorities a belt upon which Tanaquil had placed a number of healing charms, and to which miraculous properties were ascribed. Tanaquil was said to have woven the first tunica recta, the dress traditionally woven by Roman brides for their wedding day, and it was even supposed that the ancient wedding formula recited by the bride and groom, \\"ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia\\" (as you are Gaius, I am Gaia), was a reference to Tanaquil.Karen K.
