The settlement is part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and it is located approximately north of the park visitor center on Ridge Trail. The settlement contains twelve homestead log cabins, a one-room school house, and a blacksmith shop. A restored spring house on the property was used by the settlement as food storage. The settlement began in 1903 when brothers-in-law Sherman Hensley and Willy Gibbons settled their families on plots from acreage purchased by Barton Hensely, Sr. Most inhabitants belonged to either the Hensley or Gibbons families. The settlement never developed modern infrastructure or technology. The last resident was Sherman Hensley, who left in 1951. The school, together with some forty-five settlement structures and the agricultural environment, were restored to their original state in the 1960s by the Job Corps. Background The settlement dates back to 1845 when Governor William Owsley deeded on top of Brush Mountain in the Appalachian Mountains. Brothers C. and R.M. Bales, who received the land from Owsley, leased the acreage to John Nichols and Jim Nelson, who mostly used the property for livestock. They cleared the property and made some improvements, including the construction of shake-roofed chestnut log cabins. Hensley In 1903, Burton Hensley Sr. purchased the entire acreage and divided it into sixteen individual properties for his extended family. Hog farmer Sherman Hensley and his wife Nicey Ann, Barton Sr.'s daughter, moved into an existing lob cabin on her allotted twenty-one acres. The couple purchased an additional thirty-three acres. The following year, Nicey's niece Nancy and her husband Willy Gibbons also moved to the self-sustaining settlement. Most of the inhabitants of the settlement were named either Hensley or Gibbons, belonging to one of those families. The settlement never had electricity, indoor plumbing, modern roads or other conveniences. Everything was grown, raised and hand-made in the settlement. People traveled by foot or by riding a horse. A spring house was used for food storage. School house In 1908, Bell County provided a teacher for the newly erected one-room school house. Originally the school house was little more than a lean-to, erected so the Bell County Superintendent of Schools would agree to send a teacher for the settlement children. The school taught students up through the 8th grade. By the time the school closed in 1947, four different structures had served as the Brush Mountain school. The final structure was a log cabin that was heated by a wood and coal stove made of cast iron and located in the middle of the room. The school had no indoor plumbing or electricity. The student desks were made of wood and cast iron. Later years The population peaked at about 100 in 1925. During World War II residents moved away to either join the military or to work in the coal mines. Nicey Ann Hensley died in 1937. The population dwindled until 1949, when Sherman Hensley was the only resident. When Hensley finally abandoned the property in 1951, the settlement fell into disrepair. Hensley died in 1979 and is buried beside Nicey Ann at the settlement cemetery, among thirty-six other graves. Today The settlement was dedicated as part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park on July 4, 1959. The National Park Service and the Job Corps began making improvements in 1965, restoring some forty-five settlement structures and the agricultural environment to the prime time of the community. The National Park Service runs the Appalachian Hensley Settlement as a living history museum. It conducts tours of the forty-five settlement structures and agricultural resources May through October.

Biography  Schlatter was educated at the gymnasium of St. Gallen, after which he was tutored in theology, and then proceeded to the University of Leyden and then the University of Helmstedt in Brunswick. This work cites Helmstedt only as a \\"possibility.\\" He then returned to his tutor for some time before being ordained in 1739. He taught for several years in Holland and then entered the German Reformed ministry. He officiated a few months in Switzerland, and then offered his services as a missionary to the German Reformed emigrants in Philadelphia in 1746, after learning of a request made to the Dutch Reformed Church for ministers by German Reformed clergyman John Phillip Boehm and went to Pennsylvania in that year, arriving on 6 August. He served as pastor of the united churches of Germantown and Philadelphia in 1746‚Äì51, organized a synod which met in Philadelphia in 1747, and made extended missionary tours among the German Reformed settlers in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and New York State. In 1751, he returned to Europe to report on his work. In Amsterdam, he published (1751) a journal of his experiences and transactions in America, with an account of the Reformed congregations and their dearth of pastors. Of this book, he made a German translation (Frankfort, 1752), and afterward it was rendered into English by Rev. David Thomson, of Amsterdam, and distributed throughout Great Britain. As a result of Schlatter's appeal, ¬£20,000 was raised in England and Holland for the establishment of free schools among the Germans in America. He also secured the assistance of six young preachers, and 700 Bibles. In March 1752, Schlatter returned to Philadelphia with the money and preachers, and in 1755 withdrew from his pastoral activities to become superintendent of the establishment of the schools among the Germans under the auspices of the Society for the Propagation of the Knowledge of God among the Germans, a group of people from London, of whom William Smith was secretary. The schools were unpopular with the Germans, and in 1757 Schlatter resigned his superintendency. He then accepted an offer by Lord Loudoun to become chaplain of the Royal American regiment, which he accompanied on an expedition to Louisburg. He remained with the army until 1759, and then preached at Chestnut Hill and surrounding places. In 1764 he was a chaplain to the 2nd Pennsylvania Battalion under Henry Bouquet on a mission against the Indians. In 1777, while still attached to the royal army, he refused to obey orders on account of sympathy with the colonial cause. He was imprisoned, and his house was plundered. Family He married Maria Henrica Schleidorn of New York City, and they had nine children, six of whom survived them. NotesReferences * This publication in turn cites: ** Harbaugh, Henry, Life of Rev.

Very much inspired by early Big Chill Festivals and picnics in the English countryside, Festinho is driven by a hard-working team of volunteers, many of whom have in various configurations and incarnations been putting on events, DJing, VJing, and festivalling together for years. Many of the performers give their time for free so that as much money as possible goes straight to the ABC Trust.  History  ;2010: Due to space limitations in the campsite at Kentwell Hall, Festinho had to find a new home in 2010, and were rewarded in their search by finding Hinwick House in Hinwick, Bedfordshire. This afforded the festival more room for camping, and an increased space for entertainment. Moreover, its unique nature and design meant that Festinho had an opportunity to rethink their approach to providing entertainment. Notable examples of this included the ability to use parts of Hinwick House itself to provide entertainment spaces, and a main stage spanning a small stream, situated inside a Grade II listed walled garden. Festinho continued with its tried and tested formula of two live music stages, two DJ areas, a comedy and cabaret space, a healing zone (The Sanctuary), a children's areas hosted by Angel Gardens, capoeira demonstrations, a cinema space, a children's carnival and several bars and food and merchandise stalls. However, the 2010 event did not take place during the first week of September; instead, it moved forward to the last weekend in August. this is notable because this is a Bank Holiday weekend in the UK, and afforded Festinho the opportunity to provide entertainment until much later than usual on Sunday evening. Another key difference from previous years was the decision to open the campsite on Thursday evening instead of Friday afternoon. This allowed an expanded programme of music that started during Friday afternoon instead of Friday evening. The event was attended by over 3,200 people. ;2009: Festinho continued its run at Kentwell Hall in 2009, and attracted over 2,500 people. It provided more food stalls, an expanded entertainment programme, and a children's area run by Angel Gardens. ;2008: As the festival started to outgrow the space available in Yarnton, it moved in 2008 to Kentwell Hall in Long Melford, Suffolk. This afforded the event more room, and allowed it to incorporate an additional live music space, an expanded children's area, a healing zone, and a new cabaret and comedy tent hosted by Underbling & Vow. As well as providing more entertainment spaces, it also began to programme live music on the Friday evening as well as DJs, and finished on Sunday evening instead of Sunday afternoon. It was attended by around 1200 people. ;2007: In 2007, the directorship of the event was handed over as the original organiser did not have the time to create the festival. It moved back to its original home of Yarnton, and changed its name to 'Festinho' - a nonsense word which alludes to the Brazilian Portuguese word 'Festinha', meaning 'small festival'. By this time, around 800 were attending the event, and it had expanded to incorporate an additional DJ area hosted by The Disco Shed, a children's area and an additional bar. It also took the decision to begin the music programming on a Friday evening, with a select few DJs welcoming people to the event. ;2006: In 2006, the MiniChill moved to Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and followed the same pattern as the previous year; art, live music and DJs spread over 2 days, with guests arriving on Friday evening and departing on Sunday afternoon. ;2004 / 2005: A private birthday party for one of the trustees of The ABC Trust was held on the first weekend in September 2004. A friend of the charity hosted the event on the grounds of their house in Yarnton, Oxfordshire. The party involved some live music and DJs, and guests were asked to donate money to the charity. The following year, the people who organised that party decided to sell tickets (by invitation only) to a party on the same weekend; they organised a live music stage, a DJ area and artwork over two days (Saturday and Sunday), and guests were allowed to bring tents for staying overnight. The money raised from ticket sales was donated to the charity, and the event was called 'Minichill'. The event was attended by around 350 people.  Who they support  All profits from the event go to the ABC Trust, a UK- based charity that supports community art projects in Brazil geared towards developing skills and interests amongst less privileged children. Action for Brazil's Children Trust (ABC) is dedicated to helping the most vulnerable children and young people of Brazil. Every day, Brazilian children are forced to face the violence, hunger and isolation of life on the streets. Recent figures estimate that over 7 million children live a life on the streets in some way. For many, this means occasional school, petty trading, begging and prostitution, only returning to their homes in the evening. Others have no home at all and must face the dangers of sleeping on the streets; they find themselves increasingly excluded from their own communities with no way back. ABC Trust supports a variety of locally-run projects across Brazil, from counselling to medical care to film editing workshops, which give these children a second chance - helping them to transform their lives, and giving them hope for their futures. Over 3000 children and their families are reached every day through projects made possible by ABC supporters' donations. ABC Trust is a UK-based organisation set up by Jimena Page, as Founding Trustee, and Led Zeppelin legend Jimmy Page, as Founding Patron. They have since been joined by a Board of Trustees and a group of Patrons who lend a hand whenever possible.  Bands, artists and performers  As an evolving creature, Festinho is different every year and thanks to a determined team, talented artists, and most of all a truly fantastic crowd, gets better and better. It's still very small compared to most festivals, and future plans are for Festinho to stay intimate, small and with a distinctly Brazilian flavour. Previous bands and DJs that have appeared at Festinho include: Ugly Duckling, The Blockheads, British Sea Power, Crazy P, Max Cooper, Belleruche, The Bays, Eliza Carthy, Jim Moray, The Correspondents, The Leisure Society, Nancy Wallace, Gilles Peterson, Cosmo, Jon Hopkins, The Kleptones, Mixmaster Morris, Hint, Flevans, Andy Votel, Cut La Roc, Hexstatic and Jon Kennedy.  Past festivals  In 2008 and 2009, Festinho was held at Kentwell Hall, a moated, mellow redbrick Tudor mansion in Long Melford, Suffolk. In 2007, Yarnton, Oxfordshire hosted the Festinho festival.

After her father's death, Mary moved back to her native Georgia and spent the rest of her youth in the west of the country with her mother and twin sisters, Ellen and Tamar. =Marriage and Bolshevik invasion of Georgia= Mary's husband, Prince George After the establishment of the First Georgian Republic following the Russian Revolution, Mary's fianc√© Prince George Eristavi ‚Äî an important Georgian nobleman, great-great grandson of King Heraclius II of Georgia and a former aide-de-camp of Nicholas II ‚Äî returned to Georgia with intent to marry her. They wed in Kutaisi soon after his arrival and, likely because of security reasons, settled permanently in the country which at that time was a stable Menshevik stronghold under German protection. The peace in Georgia did not last long and the couple was forced to flee the country in March 1921, during the Red Army Invasion. To escape imminent imprisonment, deportation or death, Mary, along with other prominent Georgian noblemen and government officials, departed on a ship from the city of Batumi. She was reunited with her husband in Istanbul where George had been waiting for her; the couple continued the voyage to France together. =France and final years= After arriving in Paris, Mary and George settled on the Rue de la Tour in the 16th arrondissement, a district popular with the French high society. Because of losses incurred as a result of fleeing Georgia, Mary's family met some financial problems while living in this expensive neighborhood. For this reason, Mary's mother and sisters, Ellen and Tamar, initially lived with the young couple. This situation changed when the family managed to open its own clothing atelier and further improved as Mary found a modeling position with Coco Chanel, an increasingly popular French designer at the time. Soon after this success, Mary's family moved out and her husband, George, died; the couple had not had any children. Mary spent the rest of her life living alone and rarely made contact with other Georgian √©migr√©s, with the exception of her visits to a local parish of the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the final years of her life she was forced to move to a nursing home where, thanks to her improved financial circumstances, she was provided with a personal maid. Despite the relocation, she continued to visit her friends in the 16th arrondissment to play cards. According to her friend Babo Dadiani, Mary's room was filled with flowers from known and unknown admirers. Because of the Soviet Union's closed-door immigration policy, Mary, just like other √©migr√©s from the First Republic, was never able to return to Batumi, passing away in France at the age of 97. She and her husband were buried at Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery. Mary was painted by Savely Sorin; her husband by Tamara de Lempicka, a popular Polish painter.extract from the Igor Obolensky‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Enigmas Georgia‚Äù Mary and Galaktion Georgian poet Galaktion Tabidze is sometimes thought to have been in love with Mary. The word of Tabidze's alleged romantic feelings for the princess spread throughout Georgia after the publication of his poem titled \\"Mary,\\" in which the poet bitterly described the wedding ceremony of a certain Mary, without specifying whether he was referring to Princess Eristavi. Princess Mary herself disagreed with the rumors, stressing that the poem was first published in 1915 in a Georgian journal Theater and Life, while her wedding to Prince George Eristavi did not occur until 1918.extract from the Igor Obolensky‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Enigmas Georgia‚Äù Some sources confirm this, alleging that it was only in 1935 when Galaktion met Mary by accident as she sat in front of Louvre.

She participated in the Paris Commune and in the First International. Her pseudonym is also sometimes spelled Minck. Early life Ad√®le Paulina Mekarska was born on 9 November 1839, in Clermont-Ferrand. Her father, Count Jean Nepomuc√®ne Mekarski, was a Polish officer who had gone into exile after the unsuccessful Polish uprising of 1830; he was a relative of the last Polish king, Stanislas II. Her mother was an aristocrat, Jeanne-Blanche Cornelly de la Perri√®re. Ad√®le's parents were enlightened liberals who apparently became adherents of the utopian socialism of Henri de Saint-Simon. Ad√®le was well-educated, mostly by private tutors. She had two younger brothers, Louis and Jules; both participated in the Polish uprising of 1863 and in the Paris Commune. Ad√®le became a republican and an opponent of the r√©gime of Napol√©on III sometime in the 1850s. As a young woman she was married to a Polish aristocrat, Prince Bohdanowicz, with whom she had two daughters, Anna and Wanda. Nothing much is known about this epoch in her life, but the marriage seems not to have been a happy one and ended in divorce. Neither the date of her marriage to, nor that of her divorce from, Bohdanowicz are known. Possibly marriage turned Ad√®le's thoughts toward the oppression of women. In 1867, she moved to Paris, where she gave language courses and worked as a seamstress. She also associated with Polish patriotic organisations and with revolutionary socialist circles. In 1866 a feminist group called the Soci√©t√© pour la Revendication du Droit des Femmes began to meet at the house of Andr√© L√©o. Members included Paule Minck, Louise Michel, Eliska Vincent, √âlie Reclus and his wife No√©mie, Mme Jules Simon and Caroline de Barrau. Maria Deraismes also participated. Because of the broad range of opinions, the group decided to focus on the subject of improving girls' education. Ad√®le first burst on the public scene in 1868, when she began speaking and writing about women's issues and socialism. She was convinced that the emancipation of women could only be fully accomplished through the abolition of capitalism. She contributed to the venerable journal La R√©forme and joined the First International. With her friend Andr√© L√©o she founded the oddly-named Female Workers' Fraternal Society (Soci√©t√© fraternelle de l'ouvri√®re). It was based on mutualist principles inspired by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Ad√®le was now calling herself 'Paule Mink' or 'Minck' (she used both spellings) and became a tireless orator at socialist and feminist meetings. She was also active in providing aid to Polish refugees from the Russian empire. At some time, Ad√®le had a relationship with the painter Jean-Baptiste Noro, with whom she had two more daughters, named Mignon and Jeanne-H√©na. The Paris Commune In 1870, Napol√©on III went to war with Germany. As much a French as a Polish patriot, Paule Mink actively assisted in the French war effort and apparently distinguished herself to such an extent by her engagement at Auxerre that she was offered the Legion of Honour, one of France's highest awards. However, her love of France had not diminished her opposition to Napol√©on III, and she refused the medal. The Franco-Prussian War went badly for Napol√©on III, and in late 1870, his government fell. Paule Mink was then in Paris and became active in the defence of the besieged city. She supported the uprising of the Paris Commune and was a prominent revolutionary orator at the republican clubs of St. Sulpice and N√¥tre Dame. She was a member of the Committee of Vigilance of Montmartre and organised a free school for the poor at the church of St.-Pierre. With Louise Michel, Andr√© L√©o, Nathalie Lemel, Anne Jaclard and other prominent feminists, she organised a Women's Union and participated in the Commune's committee on women's rights. As always, she tirelessly advanced the argument that the struggle for feminism must be linked to the struggle for socialism. Paule Mink also made several tours to the provinces to drum up support for the Paris Commune in other cities; somehow she always managed to get through the German siege. She was absent on one of these tours during the Bloody Week (Semaine sanglante) and the suppression of the Commune. That is how she managed to evade capture and escape from France. Later years Like many refugees from the Paris Commune, Paule Mink settled in Switzerland, where she associated with the anarchist leader James Guillaume. She attended the fifth international Peace Congress at Lausanne. In spite of her associations with the anarchist followers of Bakunin, she was not an anarchist. She was close to many Blanquist refugees, with whom she had collaborated in the Commune, and read the writings of Karl Marx with interest. In the summer of 1880, a general amnesty allowed Mink to come back to Paris. She helped found the French Workers' Party which was led by Jules Guesde and Paul Lafargue. Guesde was a former anarchist who had converted to Marxism, and the POF was fiercely orthodox. She attended the POF's first congress at Le Havre as a delegate for the workers of Valence. Although, she became unliked and banished from the POF meetings due to her strong and radical feminism. Further, her feminism caused trouble with the French authorities. In 1881 she was imprisoned for her role in a demonstration on behalf of the Russian refugee Jessy Helfman. Since Mink's family had strong connections and citizenship to Russia, the French government threatened to deport her. To avoid this, she married a fellow revolutionary, the mechanic Maxime N√©gro and had two sons with him: Lucifer-Blanqui-Vercingetorix- R√©volution (who was born in 1882 and died in infancy) and Spartacus-Blanqui- R√©volution (born in 1884, renamed Maxime by a civil tribunal). At some point in the 1880s Mink left the POF to join √âdouard Vaillant's Blanquist Socialist- Revolutionary Party. However, Marxists and Blanquists collaborated increasingly closely, and in any case Mink seems not to have had a sectarian bent. In later years she again worked as an organizer for the POF, and she contributed to Beno√Æt Malon's non-sectarian journal R√©vue Socialiste. She also helped found, and contributed to, the feminist journal La Fronde in 1897, with Marguerite Durand and others. In addition to her journalism and political activism, she wrote stories, poems and plays. Two of her plays were performed at the Th√©√¢tre Social in 1893. That year, Mink ran unsuccessfully as a candidate in elections for the National Assembly. Mink was also one of the founders of the feminist organisation 'Women's Solidarity', to which she belonged until 1900. In the late 1890s, she was an outspoken Dreyfusard (a supporter of the Jewish officer who had been wrongly accused of treason). Mink died on 28 April 1901. Her remains were cremated and buried in P√®re-Lachaise cemetery. Her funeral was the occasion for a large demonstration of socialists, anarchists and feminists and ended in a violent brawl with the police. ReferencesSources 'Paule Mink'.

The term earliest reported postmark or ERP is a term used by the United Postal Stationery Society (UPSS) for the past 40 years. They have established a database in which the earliest postmarks on stamped envelopes or postal card or letter sheets is kept. Postmarks are typically dated from days to many months after the date of issuance. An envelope can come out in varying sizes, colors, or shapes without notification to the public. Collecting the earliest reported postmark for a particular variety is an ongoing effort. An earliest reported postmark is different from the first day of issue where there is a first day of issue postmark and frequently a pictorial cancellation, indicating the city and date where the item was first issued. Although primarily a US undertaking, recently the UPSS has expanded the project to include the issues of Cuba during the US occupation (1898-1902)Krieger, George T.; The Postal Stationery of the Possessions and Administrative Areas of the United States of America; United Postal Stationery Society, 2009, . and the Republic (1902-1958). Earliest reported postmarks are collected by the entire or cover (the entire envelope). The obvious reason for this is that an envelope's knife or size could not be determined if the specimen was a cut square or full corner, even if the entire postmark is retained.

Life  Wolfgang was the son of mayor Christoph Hirschbach and his wife Anna, who was the daughter merchant Hieronymus Poppe from Gotha. Hirschbach lost his mother at the age of three. He attended the Latin school in Gotha, which was under the direction John Helders who later became Gotha's superintendent. There Hirschbach acquired a solid education and insight and experience that had a lasting impact on his character and formed way of living. He was intended to follow an academic career from an early age. This explains his enrollment at the University of Jena in 1585. He went there after the completion of his training in Gotha in 1587. In Jena he followed the customs of the time and to first studied the philosophical sciences, and then turned to a degree in law. On 9 September 1593 he continued his studies at the University of Wittenberg. He completed his doctorate there on 7 March 1598 with a degree of Doctor of law. As early as 1595, Hirschbach acted as a tutor and teacher for a number of young nobles, in Wittenberg and also in Leipzig. Apparently, his lessons had merit and on 30 September the Electoral family 1601 hired him as preceptor of Duke August of Saxony. After his brother in law Benedikt Carpzov the elder left Wittenberg in 1602, Hirschbach was appointed professor on the fourth chair, presumably on the recommendation of the Electoral family. In 1608 he was promoted to the third chair of the criminal law. Associated with this chair, were a position as assessor at the electoral court of justice, the Law Faculty and the Sch√∂ppenstuhl in Wittenberg. In that task, he read the materias juris emphyteutici et compensationes and he managed during the summer semester 1611 is the office of the Rector Magnificus of the University of Wittenberg. He died on 13 September 1620 from a fever and was buried on 17 September in Wittenberg.  Family  On 21 May 1604 he married Magaretha Selfisch (born: September 22, 1587 in Wittenberg), the youngest daughter of the Samuel Selfisch. From this marriage nine children were born; three died before their father. Hirschbach must have a tight private connection to the Elector's family, as the Wittenberg parish register mentions on the baptismal record of his first-born son August, Elector Christian II of Saxony and Sophie of Brandenburg as godparents. # August Hirschbach (born April 24, 1605 in Wittenberg, died September 5, 1626 in Wittenberg) # Christian Hirschbach (born June 26, 1606 in Wittenberg) # Magaretha Hirschbach (born February 18, 1608 in Wittenberg, died May 19, 1630 in Wittenberg), married. 6 November 1627 to M.

At the time of his draft he was the most well-known name in the world of entertainment. Before entering the U.S. Army, Presley had caused national outrage with his rock and roll music. Many parents, religious leaders, and teachers groups saw his draft as a positive thing. Despite being offered the chance to enlist in Special Services to entertain the troops and live in priority housing, Presley decided to serve as a regular soldier. This earned him the respect of many of his fellow soldiers and people back home who previously viewed him in a negative light. During his service, Presley's life was affected in many ways, beginning with the death of his mother. Not long before he was to be stationed in Germany, Gladys Presley died of a heart attack brought on by acute hepatitis and cirrhosis at age 46. When he was stationed in West Germany, he met his future wife Priscilla Beaulieu and became dependent on stimulants and barbiturates. This unhealthy addiction eventually led to his divorce, and ultimately his death at age 42 in 1977.Gaar, Gillian G. \\"Ernst Jorgensen: Chronicler of Elvis' Life.\\" Goldmine 26.1 (2000): 21. International Index to Music Periodicals Full Text [ProQuest]. Web. September 27, 2016 After his release from military service, Presley found a new fan base among an older age group, thanks in part to his army career and releases of ballads over rock and roll songs. Pre- induction=Draft= On January 8, 1956, Presley turned twenty-one years old. Like most American men of that age, he was now eligible to be drafted. Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager, was well aware of his client's draft status and how it could affect his career. In the summer of 1956, Parker wrote to the Pentagon requesting that Presley be considered for Special Services. Special Services would allow Presley to do only six weeks basic training and then resume life as normal with the exception of performing several times a year for the armed forces. However, Parker had no intentions of allowing his client to ever sign up for Special Services. Special Services would require Presley to perform for free, with each performance being recorded and filmed for sale to television stations throughout the world. Only the armed forces would profit from these recordings, and Parker was in no way willing to allow anyone, even \\"Uncle Sam\\", to enjoy Presley's talents for free. Over the course of the next twelve months Parker led Presley to believe that it was still possible to avoid the draft completely. Unknown to Presley, Parker had no intention of avoiding the draft. In his eyes, after a year of some negative publicity about Presley, this was the perfect opportunity to change the view that older America had of him. Parker explained to Presley that this was a situation neither of them could refuse. When Presley was told that he would have to serve as a regular soldier he was furious; he was angry that his manager was not able to find a way out of the draft. Parker promised Presley that if he worked hard and served as a regular GI for two years, he would return \\"a bigger star\\" than when he left. On January 4, 1957, Presley attended Kennedy Veterans Hospital in Memphis for a pre-induction army medical. On January 8, Presley's twenty-second birthday, he was declared 1-A by the Memphis Draft Board; physically fit and likely to be drafted some time in the next eight months. It was on December 16 that it was officially announced that Presley would be receiving his draft notice. While fans around the country were upset about the news, parents and teachers groups were ecstatic. Presley had been, in their opinion, a menace to society. The Navy offered to create a special Elvis Presley Company made up of men from Memphis and Presley's closest friends. They also offered him the chance to perform in Las Vegas, and have his own private quarters. The Army offered Presley the chance to tour the world and visit army bases to boost morale among soldiers and encourage other young men to enlist. Presley politely told both parties that he would consider their offers. The Pentagon, too, had been in touch to offer Presley the opportunity to join Special Services, entertaining the troops without having to actually train as a regular soldier; among many soldiers and veterans it is known as \\"the celebrity wimp-out\\". After discussing each possibility with Parker, Presley decided to join up as a regular soldier. In Parker's words, \\"Taking any of these deals will make millions of Americans angry\\". =King Creole extension= Presley was originally scheduled to be inducted on January 20, 1958. However, due to commitments at Paramount and the filming schedule of his latest film, King Creole, Presley had to personally write to the Memphis Draft Board to request a deferment. He explained to them that Paramount had already spent up to $350,000 on pre-production of the film, and that many jobs were dependent on him being able to complete filming, which was due to begin on January 13. They granted him an extension until the middle of March. When news of the extension broke, angry letters were sent to the Memphis Draft Board complaining about the \\"special treatment\\" that Presley was receiving. According to Milton Bowers, head of the draft board and angered by the public outcry, Presley \\"would have automatically gotten the extension [anyway] if he hadn't been Elvis Presley the superstar\\". Worried that rock and roll music was a passing \\"fad\\", Presley wanted to make King Creole the best role he had ever acted. He knew that two years out of the limelight would mean hard work when he returned, and so he gave his all in that film to show the world that he had the potential to return as a serious, dramatic actor. Author Alanna Nash described it as \\"the performance that would forever define his potential\\". Army life=Induction= Presley being sworn into the U.S. Army at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, March 24, 1958 Two weeks after finishing King Creole, Presley reported for his induction on March 24, 1958, a day dubbed \\"black Monday\\" for his fans by the press. Presley was given a physical and assigned army serial number 53310761, before being sworn in and made leader of his group. Parker, with the permission of the army, had arranged for news crews from around the world to be on hand to report Presley's entry into the army. After his final goodbyes to family and friends, Presley and his fellow recruits were taken by bus to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. =Fort Hood= Presley spent four days at Fort Chaffee before being transferred to Fort Hood in Texas. After being assigned to Company A of the Third Armored Division's 1st Medium Tank Battalion, Presley completed basic training by June. He had become a pistol sharpshooter, and expressed his enjoyment at the \\"rough and tumble\\" of the tanks obstacle course. To friends back home, however, he was less upbeat. In letters to friend Alan Fortas, Presley described his homesickness and insisted that he hated the training. Eddie Fadal, another of Presley's friends, remembers that Presley would worry about his career, fearing it was all over. One of Presley's instructors, Bill Norwood, who let Presley use his phone to call home on many occasions, recalls Presley breaking down in tears during many of these phone calls. After a short break to record new material for RCA Victor in June, Presley returned to Fort Hood to finish his tank training. He was now living off post, in his own house, with his mother, father, grandmother, and friend Lamar Fike; soldiers who had dependents living off post were allowed to live with them. Having his family close by cheered him up immensely, although he still spoke to friends about his fears for his career. Parker, who was often a visitor to Presley's home, would attempt to reassure his client. Parker had arranged for enough material and merchandise to be available to keep Presley's name in the public arena during his two years in the service. Although Presley nodded along in agreement with his manager, he was not really convinced that he could return to what he had known previously. =Mother's death= In early August, while in Texas with her son, Gladys took ill. She had recently increased her alcohol intake to cope with her son's fame and army commitments, and she had also begun using diet pills to attempt to lose weight. This, coupled with a bad diet, had led to the deterioration of her liver. One afternoon, after a heated argument with her husband Vernon, Gladys collapsed from exhaustion. Presley arranged for her and Vernon to return to Memphis on August 8. The next day Gladys' condition worsened so rapidly that she was rushed to a hospital. On August 11, after calls from her doctor, Presley requested emergency leave to visit with his mother. After initially being turned down and threatening to go AWOL, Presley was eventually given permission to leave on August 12. The officer who initially denied Presley his emergency leave was later disciplined for his actions. On August 14, Gladys died from cirrhosis. The official cause of death was listed as heart attack, but the Presleys refused an autopsy to verify it. Presley and Vernon were both devastated by her death. Her funeral was held on August 15, and Presley collapsed several times before, during, and after the service. His mother had always been the most important person in his life, and now he felt as though everything he had worked for had been for nothing. Presley's leave was extended by five days on August 18, and when he finally left to return to Fort Hood he left instructions that nothing in his mother's room was to be altered. Life in Germany=1958= Bad Nauheim Villa Grunewald After training at Fort Hood, Presley was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32nd Armor, 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, West Germany. He left Fort Hood on September 19, headed for Brooklyn Army Terminal in New York where he and his division would ship out to West Germany on September 22. After a short press conference arranged by Parker, which also involved Presley walking up and down the plank of the eight times for cameras, the ship set sail and Presley would spend the rest of his service overseas. During the crossing Presley became a friend of a fellow soldier named Charlie Hodge. Hodge, who had enjoyed some success as an entertainer himself before being drafted, encouraged Presley to help him put together a show for the troops. Presley accepted his request, but only agreed to play piano in the background; Parker had drilled into him that there would be no public performances of any kind during his service. Hodge would become such a close friend to Presley during their time in the army that he was invited to work for him when they were both discharged. On October 1 the USS General George M. Randall (AP-115) arrived in West Germany and Presley was once again offered the chance to join Special Services. Again he politely refused, and was instead given the task of driving the commanding officer of Company D, Captain Russell. Russell, however, did not take to the attention surrounding Presley, and he was transferred to driving duties for Reconnaissance Platoon Sergeant Ira Jones of Company C. Elvis Presley-Monument at former Ray Barracks, 2017 Shortly after arriving in West Germany, Presley was allowed to live off post. He and his family moved into Hilberts Parkhotel in Bad Homburg then to the Grunewald Hotel in Bad Nauheim, a town even closer to Friedberg, a city hosting the HQ of Ray Barracks. In the meantime, from the United States, Parker wrote on a nearly daily basis to Presley about how things were going back home. He had acquired deals with RCA and 20th Century Fox to make sure Presley's return to public life would go as smoothly as possible. RCA agreed to release an album of Presley's press conference the day he left for West Germany; titled Elvis Sails, the album would pay Presley $0.22 per sale in royalties, guaranteed up to at least 100,000 copies.Elvis Day by Day, pp. 127‚Äì130 20th Century Fox had agreed upon a $200,000 fee for one Presley film, with options on a second for $250,000 and a 50/50 split on profits. Paramount, too, had signed deals to produce a number of new Presley films after his release; what would eventually become G.I. Blues was agreed upon for $175,000 and a three-picture option was also included. Parker also reassured his client about the press coverage he was receiving while overseas. News outlets were reporting regularly on stories, mostly released by Parker himself, about plans for Presley's return to entertainment. Stories of wild parties in Presley's hotel room were also making it into the papers regularly, and Parker was forced to hold a press conference to dispel these rumors. For Presley, however, being away in West Germany was not all happy times. He would often write home to friends and family about how homesick he was, how desperately he missed his mother, and of how his fears about his career still clouded his mind. Introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant while on maneuvers, he became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\"‚Äînot only for energy, but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss, as well‚Äîand many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, later including it in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity while in the service. He donated his army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the post, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. =1959= Presley in Germany Elvis Presley Memorial at former U.S. proving ground Eichkopf near Ober-M√∂rlen In early 1959, after a combination of a few complaints from other guests about the behavior of Presley fans wanting to see him at the Grunewald Hotel and the arrival of King Saud of Saudi Arabia, whose rather large entourage demanded the closing of the entire facility so that they could be well taken care of, particularly as his stay there was for medical reasons, Elvis and the group left the hotel and moved to a five-bedroom house nearby, at #14 Goethestrasse, soon to become the then West Germany's most celebrated private address. Fans would congregate outside the house to see Presley as he came and went to work, and a sign was put up stating that autographs would be given between 7:30 and 8:00pm. Although Presley's manager had forbidden him from performing while in the army, pressure from RCA for him to record new material led to Parker sending a microphone and a tape recorder to West Germany. Presley had recorded a handful of songs before he left for West Germany to cover his time away, but RCA was worried that they would run out of material before March 1960. In a letter to his client, Parker explained that recordings of Presley with just a piano for accompaniment, singing gospel songs would be good enough; his fans would just want to hear him sing anything. Presley used the recorder to mess around with friends and family, singing mainly gospel and current hits, but none of these recordings were sent back for release by RCA. Decades later these recordings would be released officially on titles such as Private Presley and Home Recordings. In June, with 15 days' leave to enjoy, Presley and his friends traveled to Munich and Paris. Two days in Munich were followed by over a week of partying in Paris where, on several occasions, Presley would invite the whole chorus line of girls from The 4 O'Clock club back to his hotel.Elvis: His Life from A To Z, p. 117 =Dee Stanley= Around this time Presley's father, Vernon, had been getting close to a woman named Dee Stanley, the wife of army sergeant Bill Stanley.Elvis: His Life from A To Z, p. 187 Originally Dee had written to Presley inviting him to dinner. She had seen him live during one of his earliest performances in the fifties, and she was keen to meet a star of his stature. Presley, not interested in dinner with someone he knew was considerably older, sent his father in his place.The Elvis Encyclopedia, p. 498‚Äì499 Most biographers state that Dee was already in the process of divorcing her husband when she met Vernon, but some others claim that Vernon had gotten to know both of them together, and was even asked by Bill to help him save his marriage. When Presley heard of the relationship between his father and Dee he flew into a rage; in his mind his father had no business to be setting up with another woman so soon after the death of Gladys. Dee returned to the US in the summer of 1959, closely followed by Vernon, and the pair returned to West Germany together. Close friends of Presley have stated that Bill received a \\"handsome payoff\\" for his signature on the divorce papers. Dee and Vernon eventually married in 1960, with her children becoming stepbrothers to Presley. Although Presley never liked Dee, he became very close to her young children and welcomed them to his home as the brothers he never had; in later years they were employed as bodyguards and drivers. Dee Stanley Presley died on September 28, 2013. =Elvis meets Priscilla= On September 13, airman Currie Grant, who had met Presley a couple of months earlier, introduced him to 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu during a party at Bob's home. Witnesses recall that Presley took an instant liking to Priscilla, and the pair were practically inseparable during the rest of his time in West Germany. They would eventually marry after a seven-and-a- half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla says that despite his worries that it would ruin his career, Parker convinced Presley that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a regular soldier rather than in Special Services, where he would have been able to give some musical performances and stay in touch with the public. Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including \\"Wear My Ring Around Your Neck\\", the best-selling \\"Hard Headed Woman\\", and \\"One Night\\" in 1958, and \\"(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I\\" and the number one \\"A Big Hunk o' Love\\" in 1959. RCA also managed to generate four albums compiling old material during this period, most successfully Elvis' Golden Records (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart. Discharge Prestwick Airport recording the only occasion when Elvis Presley set foot in the UK On January 20, 1960, Presley was promoted to sergeant. The army held a press conference on March 1 before Presley departed from West Germany. Presley was asked about his decision to serve as a regular soldier instead of as part of the service club. He said, \\"I was in a funny position. Actually, that's the only way it could be. People were expecting me to mess up, to goof up in one way or another. They thought I couldn't take it and so forth, and I was determined to go to any limits to prove otherwise, not only to the people who were wondering, but to myself\\". On March 2, with Priscilla in attendance, Presley waved goodbye to the fans and media of Germany and flew home to the U.S. En route, his plane stopped at Prestwick Airport in Scotland to refuel; this was the one and only time that Presley would set foot in the United Kingdom. On March 3, Presley's plane arrived at McGuire Air Force Base near Fort Dix, New Jersey, at 7:42 am. Nancy Sinatra, RCA representatives, and Parker were there to welcome him home, as well as a huge crowd of fans. Two days later, on March 5, Presley was officially discharged from active duty with his service officially notated as Honorable. Awards 90px Army Good Conduct Medal Upon completion of his service Presley was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal. He also qualified as an expert marksman with several weapons.

The organization addresses complex problems through simple solutions with a vision towards healthy, affordable food for all. Wholesome Wave operates two nutrition incentive programs, the Double Value Coupon Program and the Fruit & Vegetable Prescription Program, which tackle the issue of affordability for underserved consumers. Accessibility is emphasized through their supply chain work with food hubs, retail outlets and convenience stores. Wholesome Wave's innovative programs address the complex issues of food insecurity, farm viability, economic vitality of local communities, and diet-related diseases. Wholesome Wave was founded in 2007 by Michael Batterberry, Gus Schumacher and Michel Nischan. The Obama administration named Wholesome Wave as one of five major strategy groups making a difference in the fight against childhood obesity in its \\"White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the President\\" White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the President, 2010 and Guidestar's Philanthropedia named Wholesome Wave one of 18 outstanding nonprofits combatting childhood obesity. Wholesome Wave Programs Wholesome Wave programs increase access to affordable, healthy, locally grown fruits and vegetables for underserved consumers. Wholesome Wave programs work with community-based organizations in 27 states and D.C. =Double Value Coupon Program (DVCP)= Wholesome Wave's hallmark initiative is the Double Value Coupon Program (DVCP). DVCP is a national network of nutrition incentive programs that operate at farmers markets in 25 states and D.C. These programs allow federal benefit consumers ‚Äì those who receive SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), Women, Infant & Children (WIC) vouchers, and Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) vouchers, to receive a monetary incentive when they spend their benefits at farmers markets on locally grown produce. Consumers increase their purchase and consumption of healthy foods, farmers see increased revenue, and dollars stay within the local economy. This program was initiated in 2008 at 12 farmers' markets in California, Connecticut and Massachusetts. DVCP History In 2007, Gus Schumacher and John Hyde raised money to double the value of food stamps, WIC vouchers, and benefits for seniors. Schumacher, Wholesome Wave's co-founder, approached the National Watermelon Association for $5,000 to run a program at Crossroads Farmers Market. Simultaneously, Schumacher and Michel Nischan founded Wholesome Wave. The Double Value Coupon Program was launched in 2008 at the Westport, CT farmers market with seed money for the pilot program from the Betsy and Jesse Fink Foundation. In 2009, building from successful pilot programs in 2008 and with support from a number of foundations and donors, Wholesome Wave outreach expanded the DVCP program to ten states and the District of Columbia. As of 2014, the program has expanded to include a network of more than 60 partners operating incentives programs at more than 350 markets in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Annually, the programs benefit nearly 40,000 participants and their families. Wholesome Wave partners with over 60 community-based non-profit organizations to bring these DVCP incentives to federal benefit recipients that can be redeemed towards fresh locally grown produce.

Healthcare providers work in conjunction with local nonprofits and Wholesome Wave to collect data on patient progress and measure success. FVRx History In 2010, Wholesome Wave implemented a feasibility study where a total of 246 participants were served in five New England cities through work with three healthcare partners and a statewide network of farmers markets during the 2010 farmers' market season. The CAVU foundation, Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited, sponsored the clinics that administer the Fruit & Veggie Prescription Program. The Massachusetts Department of Agriculture as well as Wholesome Wave each contributed $10,000 in seed money to the pilot program. Wholesome Wave expanded the program during its 2011 pilot season to sites in Massachusetts, Maine, California and Rhode Island. In 2012, the program expanded to include twelve sites in seven states throughout the United States and the District of Columbia. In July 2013, FVRx launched a four-month-long pilot that brought the program to two New York City Hospitals in Harlem and the Bronx. The pilot was run through partnership with the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) and was funded through a $250,000 grant from the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund as part of their Healthy Food and Community Change initiative. \\"The Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program ‚Äî FVRx ‚Äî turns local farmers markets into pharmacies,\\" says the Wall Street Journal. \\"Patients receive $2 of 'Health Bucks' coupons for each member of the family, and the coupons can be used to buy fresh produce once a week. Health Bucks are redeemable at any of the city's 142 farmers markets.\\" In 2014, the FVRx NYC HHC Pilot expanded to three hospitals in the city. The New York Times lauds the program as a \\"win-win endeavor.\\" FVRx Process For a patient and their children to participate in the program, they are enrolled by their primary care provider who then introduces them to a nutritionist. The nutritionist will then meet with the participants each month to establish a plan that will reinforce healthy eating habits within the family. After their level of need is established based on consumption habits and Body Mass Index (BMI), the family's health care provider will then distribute prescriptions of a specified number of servings of fruits and vegetables per day. These prescriptions can then be redeemed at participating farmers' markets. These prescriptions can be redeemed weekly throughout participation in the 4- to 6-month-long program and are refilled monthly by the health care provider who will set new goals for healthy eating. =Healthy Food Commerce Investments (HFCI)= Healthy Food Commerce Investments (HFCI) helps to direct capital towards the development of regional food infrastructure by facilitating investments in local \\"food hubs.\\" The initiative was started in 2011 as a way to encourage reform of food distribution within local food systems. HFCI History In 2011, Wholesome Wave launched HFCI to help direct capital into a variety of different projects that build infrastructure for local food systems in a way that promotes regional economy but also serves a wide variety of institutions, small farmers, and distribution centers. In 2013, HFCI successfully helped to facilitate the expansion and development of three distributions centers spanning the East Coast - Farm Fresh Rhode Island, Red's Best, and Dorchester-Pearl.

It was one of two PEN International Centers in the United States, the other being the PEN America in New York City. On March 1, 2018, PEN Center USA unified under the PEN America umbrella as the PEN America Los Angeles office. PEN Center USA was founded in 1943 and incorporated as a nonprofit association in 1981. Much of PEN Center USA's programming continues out of the PEN America Los Angeles office, including the Emerging Voices Fellowship, PEN In The Community writing residencies and guest speaker program, and PEN Presents conversation series.  History  The organization was originally established in 1943. In 1952 PEN International granted it the right to become PEN Los Angeles Center, able to set up its own chapters. In 1981 it was incorporated as a Non-profit organization. In 1988 it requested a name change, and eventually it was renamed to PEN USA Center West. On March 1, 2018, PEN Center USA unified under the PEN America banner. Mission statement PEN Center USA's mission is to stimulate and maintain interest in the written word, to foster a vital literary culture, and to defend freedom of expression domestically and internationally.  Freedom To Write Programming  PEN Center USA offers Freedom to Write programming, manifested in four channels of action: the FTW Advocacy Network, the Emerging Voices Fellowship, PEN in the Community, and the annual Literary Awards. Each of these programs pursue the goals of the essential Freedom to Write idea‚Äîto support writers' freedom of expression and to promote access to their writing globally.\\"Freedom to Write Programs\\", PEN Center USA. = Freedom to Write Advocacy Network = Freedom to Write Advocacy Network is a worldwide, collaborative effort to support free speech and to defend writers whose civil and human rights have been violated. In 1948, International PEN members helped to craft Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees that \\"everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression‚Ä¶ and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\\" PEN holds Category A status at UNESCO and consultative status with the United Nations. As a member of International PEN's Writers in Prison Committee, PEN Center USA members visit their colleagues in prison in other parts of the world and deliver aid in the form of letters and financial assistance. PEN Center USA's Freedom to Write Committee, made up of more than 200 volunteer writers, investigates regional and country-specific problems. Past efforts include the Nigeria Initiative, aimed at publicizing the link between oil politics and the silencing of dissent in Nigeria, and a coordinated campaign to end violent attacks against journalists in Latin America. As a member of the Rapid Action Network of PEN International, the PEN Center USA receives and responds to reports of arrests, attacks, and threats to more than 700 writers currently at risk around the world.\\"Freedom to Write: NEWS\\", PEN Center USA. = PEN in the Community = A PEN In The Community (PITC) writing residency is a generative writing workshop that takes place in a classroom, community center, nonprofit organization, shelter, or reservation. Written work collected during the residency is published by PEN Center USA in PITC anthologies, which are windows into participant's lives‚Äîtheir struggles, hopes, and experiences. PITC instructors are selected from PEN Center USA's diverse membership to best match the needs of the community where they will teach. In preparation for a PITC writing residency, PITC instructors and community leaders attend a mandatory orientation session at the PEN Center USA office. Then, working with the community leader, the PITC instructor develops a curriculum, with the goal of helping the participants complete a solid body of creative writing work. A PITC writing residency consists of twelve in-class writing workshops, the publication of a participant anthology, and a final public reading. Throughout the semester, the PITC program coordinator makes visits to each community center and communicates with all PITC instructors and community leaders on a weekly basis.\\"PEN in the Community\\", PEN Center USA. = Emerging Voices Fellowship = Emerging Voices is a literary fellowship that aims to provide new writers, who lack access, with the tools they will need to launch a professional writing career. The eight-month fellowship includes: PROFESSIONAL MENTORSHIP: Emerging Voices Mentors are carefully chosen from PEN Center USA's membership and from professional writers based in Los Angeles. The Mentor-Fellow relationship is expected to challenge the fellow's work and compel significant creative progress. Over the course of the fellowship, Emerging Voices Fellows and Mentors should meet three times in person, and be in contact at least once a month. In these three meetings, Mentors will offer written feedback on the Emerging Voices Fellows' work in progress. Authors who have been mentors in the past include Ron Carlson, Harryette Mullen, Chris Abani, Ramona Ausubel, Meghan Daum, and Sherman Alexie. CLASSES AT THE UCLA EXTENSION WRITERS' PROGRAM: Participants will attend two free courses (a 12-week writing course and a one-day workshop) at UCLA Extension, donated by the Writers' Program. Program Manager will assist the Emerging Voices Fellows with course selection. AUTHOR EVENINGS: Every Monday, fellows will meet with a visiting author, editor or publisher and ask questions about craft. Fellows must read each visiting author's book before the evening. A schedule of Author Evenings will be distributed at the first Emerging Voices orientation meeting. Authors who have participated in the past have included Jonathan Lethem, Percival Everett, Maggie Nelson, Cynthia Bond, Aimee Bender, Jerry Stahl, and Bruce Bauman, senior editor of the literary magazine Black Clock. MASTER CLASSES: After completing the UCLA Extension Writers' Program courses, Emerging Voices Fellows will enroll in a Master Class. The Master Class is a genre-specific workshop with a professional writer that affords fellows the opportunity to exchange feedback on their works in progress. Previous Master Class Instructors have included Diana Wagman, Alex Espinoza, and Paul Mandelbaum. VOLUNTEER PROJECT: All Emerging Voices Fellows are expected to complete a 25-hour volunteer project that is relevant to the literary community. A few of the organizations that have participated included WriteGirl, 826LA, Cedars-Sinai Hospital, and STARS ‚Äì San Diego Youth Services. VOICE INSTRUCTION CLASS: The Fellowship will provide a one-day workshop with Dave Thomas, a professional voice actor. The Emerging Voices Fellows will read their work in a recording studio and receive instruction on reading their work publicly. PUBLIC READINGS: Fellows will participate in three public readings, The Welcome Party, Tongue & Groove Salon, and the Final Reading. Fellows have read in various venues and events including the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, Silver Lake Jubilee, Skylight Bookstore, The Standard, Downtown LA. and Hotel Caf√©. For the past five years, the fellowship has culminated in a Final Reading held in Hammer Museum's Billy Wilder Theater, showcasing the progress each fellow has made in his or her work. STIPEND: The fellowship includes a $1,000 stipend, given in $500 increments. Participants need not be published, but the fellowship is directed toward poets and writers of fiction and creative nonfiction with clear ideas of what they hope to accomplish through their writing.\\"PEN Center USA Emerging Voices Fellowship\\", PEN Center USA. The program is directed towards new writers who lack financial or creative access and writers from immigrant, minority, and other underserved communities. = Literary awards and festival = PEN Center USA's annual awards program, established in 1982, is a unique, regional competition that recognizes literary excellence in eleven categories: fiction, creative nonfiction, research nonfiction, poetry, children's literature, graphic literature, translation, journalism, drama, teleplay, and screenplay. Past award winners include Barbara Kingsolver, Maxine Hong Kingston, T. C. Boyle, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Each year, PEN Center USA calls for submissions of work produced or published during one calendar year by writers living west of the Mississippi River. Entries in the eleven categories are reviewed and judged by panels of distinguished writers, critics, and editors. Winners are announced the following fall and each receives a $1,000 cash prize, a free year of membership with PEN Center USA, and an invitation to the Annual Literary Awards Festival in Los Angeles. The Literary Awards Festival is held in Beverly Hills and includes a dinner, a silent auction or raffle, and the presentation of The Literary Awards and honoree awards. This gala is the only one of its scope on the West Coast and is attended by more than 400 prominent members of the literary community. Past recipients of the Award of Honor and Lifetime Achievement Award include Ray Bradbury, Elmore Leonard, Norman Lear, Carolyn See, Gore Vidal, and Billy Wilder. The evening also features the presentation of the prestigious First Amendment Award, given to a candidate who has done work in the domestic United States to protect the First Amendment, as well as the Freedom to Write Award, given to a candidate who has fought for freedom of expression internationally. Both awards honor men and women who have produced exceptional work in the face of extreme adversity, who have been punished for exercising their freedom of expression, or who have fought against censorship and defended the right to publish freely.  Membership  PEN Center USA's membership consists of over 700 published authors (Professional members), as well as literary community supporters (Distinguished Patron and Patron members), students (Student members), and booksellers (Bookseller members). The annual dues of membership, which vary by type, provide significant financial support that allows members to carry out the work of PEN Center USA.\\"PEN Center USA membership\\", PEN Center USA.

Muhammad recommended, but without coercion, that the people do that. They immediately gave the man back all his wealth. Abu al- As captors immediately agreed to release him from their captivity.

Based on the Disney Fairies franchise, it was produced by DisneyToon Studios and animated by Prana Studios. It features the voices of Mae Whitman, Lucy Liu, Raven-Symon√©, Megan Hilty, Angela Bartys, and others, as Tinker Bell and the other fairies of Pixie Hollow in Never Land, taking part in an Olympic-style competition. It is based loosely on J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan stories, by way of Disney's animated adaptation. It was originally intended as the last of five feature-length films in the Tinker Bell series of direct-to-DVD 3D animated films, with the title Tinker Bell: Race through the Seasons, and a release date in 2012. However, the movie was rescheduled and retooled as a TV special instead of a film-length movie. Unlike the previous feature films in this series, Tinker Bell is not a central featured character in this special release. Plot Rosetta is busy helping to set up flowers for the big night, when she meets a new garden fairy named Chloe. Chloe announces she has been training for the Pixie Hollow Games and is excited to be competing. Even though the garden fairies have little hope of winning and haven't ever won, Chloe is confident that she and her partner can turn things around and end their losing streak. When it comes time for the team selection, Chloe has already volunteered and Rosetta is selected to be her partner. On the night of the games, Rosetta wears a fancy gown, certain that she and Chloe will be eliminated after one round. The storm fairies, Rumble and Glimmer, are the heavy favorites to win the competition due to their winning streak and having winners rings for almost every finger. The first event is leapfrogging. Rosetta refuses to get onto the frog, but finally does when the spectators yell in protest, leading to total chaos on the racetrack. The next day, Rosetta and Chloe continue to compete in a series of games, such as dragonfly water skiing, twig-spheres, and mouse polo, slowly moving up in the standings during each game. The final challenge (a teacup race) arrives. Chloe dives down the chute with no trouble, but Rosetta nervously crawls down the chute, to Chloe's dismay. Rosetta's actions put them in last place, causing Chloe to start doubting her. Meanwhile, other teams start dropping which leaves only the garden and storm fairies. Rosetta and Chloe take the mudslide mountain shortcut and successfully make it over thanks to Tinker Bell. However, in the last leg of the race, Rumble uses Glimmer's lightning ability to zap one of the wheels causing the girls' cart to crash. Glimmer is appalled. Seeing their cart destroyed, Rosetta and Chloe push their cart over the finish line and finish together. While Rumble celebrates his victory, Queen Clarion announces that the garden fairies are the winners. Rumble protests, until she shows him that Glimmer abandoned him just before the finish line for cheating, giving the victory to the garden fairies. Rosetta and Chloe broke their losing streak and they celebrate with their friends.

By marriage she was heiress of Hunyad Castle and Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach.  Life  Beatrice was a daughter of Bernardin Frankopan, Knez (Prince) of Krk and Modru≈° (1453‚Äì1529) from his marriage to Donna Luisa Marzano d'Aragona, daughter of Giovanni Francesco Marino Marzano, Prince of Squillace. Her brother Christoph Frankopan (1482‚Äì1527) was Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia under the reign of the Hungarian king John Z√°polya. Beatrice first married in 1496 to John Corvinus (1473‚Äì1504), an illegitimate son of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, with whom she had two children: * Elisabeth (1496‚Äì1508). * Christoph (1499‚Äì1505), the last of the House of Hunyadi Corvinus. * Matthias (1504‚Äì1505). Hunyad Castle She was described as extremely beautiful and after her husband's death she inherited Hunyad Castle and she administered her children's estates. However, they both died young (probably poisoned), soon after their father. After the mourning period, King Vladislaus II of Hungary had her married to his nephew, the Hohenzollern prince George of Brandenburg- Ansbach (1484‚Äì1543), on 21 January 1509 in Gyula. King Vladislav transferred all of the Corvinus property to George. Apart from Hunyad Castle, this included, among others, the fortress of Lipova with 252 villages. Through his wife, George became one of the most powerful landowners in Hungary, though he had to cope with border disputes with the rivalling Szapolyai dynasty.

Its purpose is to lobby for a change in recent legislation in Ireland. Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 requires long-established self-trained architects to undergo assessments before continuing to practice. The Alliance regards the present assessment test as inappropriate and overly expensive. It sees itself as in conflict with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. The Alliance has declared its founders to be Leonard Barrett (Midleton), Liam Hazel (Skibbereen), Brian Montaut (Bray) and Adrian Turner (Athlone). The foundation and aims of the Alliance The Architects' Alliance of Ireland (AAoI)Architects' Alliance of Ireland web site was formed at the start of 2009 in response to Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.The Building Control Act 2007, Irish Legislation The Act sought for the first time to control the use of the term \\"architect\\" in the Republic of Ireland. Prior to the passing of the Act any practitioner could legally use the title architect. The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) claims that it is to protect the consumer that the Building Control Act protected the title. The AAoI is lobbying for an amendment of the legislation to allow self-taught and other qualified practitioners, established 7 years prior to the enforcement of the Building Control Act 2007, to be automatically registered as architects without undergoing examinations that they consider discriminative. AAoI claims that automatic registration is a privilege that was offered to established RIAI members. It also claims that the current assessment is designed by the RIAI to fail the large majority of applicants. In May 2010 and July 2012 it gave evidence before an Oireachtas (national parliament) committee, the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The group is arguing for a grandfather clause and is lobbying for an amendment to that effect before the RIAI, TDs, Ministers and the European Commission.Call for 'grandfather clause' in legislation for architects' register The Irish Times - Wednesday, 19 May 2010. It claims to have found inconsistencies in the legislation and its implementation, and has complained to the Irish Government, the Competition Authority of Ireland, and the European Commission. The lobbying efforts of the Alliance gained the support of John O'Donoghue TD who has tabled The Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2010.\\"RIAI questions need for additional ‚Äògrandfather clause‚Äô\\" Tuesday, 27 July 2010 Due to a change in government the bill was never presented in front of the Dail (lower house of the Irish Parliament). AAoI is concerned about the RIAI having a monopoly on architecture in the Republic of Ireland. The RIAI has represented the profession in Ireland since 1839, prior to the creation of the Republic of Ireland, when the country was still under the influence of British rules. Members and supporters of the RIAI claim that their institute has been involved in the training and governing of architects for many years, that it played a very important role in ensuring high standards in the profession. The AAoI claims that the RIAI is a limited company which has used its influence in front and within the government for the Building Control Act to suit RIAI interests as well as the interest of RIAI members and directors. The AAoI claims that the registration system set up by the RIAI favours the Institution's own members while discriminating against others, especially self-taught architects. The RIAI claims that the registration system simply recognises that RIAI members have already passed rigorous professional examinations and assessments similar to those required by the new legislation. On this ground, the AAoI stated that its members are ready to pass a similar examination (so called part 3), but are opposed to the actual examinations specially designed for self-taught architects, that they consider discriminative and overly expensive.The Registration of Architects - Minutes of Dail Committee Meeting In 2009, the cost for the Irish Prescribed Register Examination called ARAEARAE Architects Register Admission Examination web site for self-trained architects was ‚Ç¨11,500 + ‚Ç¨2,000 for lectures, compared to ‚Ç¨3,500 in the Netherlands. In 2013, the cost of the ARAE was lowered to ‚Ç¨8,500 + ‚Ç¨1,250 for lectures. Background Although in 2006 the Competition Authority of Ireland had recommended the creation of an Architects Council of Ireland to be independent of the RIAI, the 2007 Act left the RIAI as the registration body, albeit with various safeguards. The Irish legislation states that practitioners with a minimum of 7 years of experience but without recognised formal qualification must be assessed through an examination to continue practising in the State. The AAoI considers the examination as inappropriate and exclusionary. The current system allows RIAI members to be automatically registered. AAoI wants a grandfather clause to be included in the Act for an automatic registration of self-trained professionals who have practised as architects for a minimum of 7 years within the Republic of Ireland. European countries such as the UK,Architects (Registration) Act 1931 (UK) France,Loi n¬∞77-2 du 3 janvier 1977 sur l'architecture (Architects Act in France) Belgium,Loi du 20 fevrier 1939 (Architects Act in Belgium) Italy,legge 24 June 1923 No. 1395 (Architects Act in Italy) The NetherlandsRefer to document on the Dutch Registration System drafted after a meeting between the General Secretary and Dr. Hans Groenevald, Director of the Stichting Bureau Architectenreglster, (SBA) in the Hague on 1 October 1993. 1 October 1993 is a significant date because on that day the protection of the title \\"architect\\" came into force in the Netherlands. when first implementing the registration of architects, have included a grandfather clause in their legislation. Legal opinion provided to AAoI advises that such a change would not be in conflict with European Union law. Examinations for Self-taught Architects The ARAE is an examination for practitioners who have gained 7 years of experience at any given time. Since 2012 the cost of the ARAE was lowered to ‚Ç¨8,500 (+ optional ‚Ç¨1,350 for an additional lecture course which is essential to the examination).see ARAE website The position of AAoI is that the ARAE still is unaffordable for the large majority of self-taught architects due to the cost of the examination and the loss of income associated to it. Since 2009, only 30 architects out of many hundreds of potential applicants have successfully completed the ARAE Examination. The RIAI claims that the methodology is specifically designed for practising architects, and that it is suited to those in employment as examinations are arranged in stages over one calendar year. On the contrary, AAoI has explained in many meetings that the ARAE methodology is unsuitable for practicing architects, with many lectures and examinations organised during office hours and spanning on a period of approximately 10 months. An employee would not be able to pass the ARAE without the permission of his employer, without opting out of employment for many weeks. A self-employed would have problems to meet the demands of its clients while preparing and passing the ARAE. He would need to refuse projects and contracts to ensure success to the examination. The \\"Technical Assessment\\" is an examination for self-trained architects with more than 10 years of experience gained in the Republic of Ireland prior to the enforcement of architects‚Äô registration. AAoI claims that the fees are inappropriate (‚Ç¨6,500 in 2009, lowered to ‚Ç¨4,500 in 2011),Refer to technical assessment cost from the RIAI website and that the RIAI is manipulating the procedure by setting up academic and administrative standards that do not reflect the practice of architecture before the implementation of registration. The RIAI claims that the examinations are based on internationally recognised standards and that 80% of candidates to date have been successful. The AAoI claims that the 80% success rate to the technical assessment is false and that the percentage is nearer to 50%. AAoI declared that less of a dozen of practitioners (out of hundreds of potential applicants) have applied for the Technical Assessment. The RIAI claims that the majority of those on the registration board are not architects and that they are not affiliated to the RIAI. AAoI stated that the sub-boards assessing applicants are made of 3 RIAI affiliated architects only, and that it would be difficult for any member of the assessment board not affiliated to the RIAI, to challenge the opinion and position of RIAI members on architectural subjects. AAoI members claim that the assessment is set up by their competitors. The RIAI states that the fees for registration are now approved by the government.  Chronological Development =AAoI actions and related events 2011= AAoI members lobbied local TDs (Teachta D√°la) for addressing newly elected Minister Hogan on the subject of their concerns.Refer to the AAoI website News Page Phil Hogan supported the Alliance as a TD and may have required the recent changes in examination fees. In 2012, the position of the Alliance is that the actual examinations are still inappropriate and discriminatory for all self-trained architects established prior to the publication of the Building Control Bill 2005. Some members of the RIAI claim that the examinations are seen by most registered architects as very appropriate to the profession, that they are based on internationally recognised basic standards and discriminate only between those who know the necessary subject matter and those who do not. The RIAI claims that this is important if consumers are to be protected. On this ground AAoI thinks that consumers are not protected by the RIAI. It claims that the RIAI is a limited company acting mainly for the interests of its directors and members. AAoI stated that despite many failures well advertised in Irish newspapers, the RIAI never defended consumers over its members, and that in the contrary, it always protected and reduced its members'liability instead of acting toward consumers' interests. The AAoI claims that the RIAI wrongly uses the subjects of Public Safety to limit competition, that public safety can be implemented by other means and that limiting the competition for architects to RIAI ltd membership will not serve the public nor protect consumers. =AAoI actions and related events 2012= Members of the new government have decided to review the actual situation in order to find a solution to the conflict. Architects' Alliance of Ireland gained the support of TDs and Senators. Deputy Ciar√°n Lynch, chairman of the \\"Joint committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht\\", organised a meeting with the RIAI and the AAoI in order to debate and find solutions for the registration of the so-called \\"grandfather architects\\". The issue of the Building Control (amendment) Regulations 2012 was also the subject of the meeting, but it was only rarely addressed during the 2 hours debate. During the meeting, AAoI explained how new regulations are preventing its members to provide a full architectural service despite the previous RIAI's assertions stating that: \\"The Act does prevent those not on the Register from using the title architect but it does not limit or control in any way the functions of those providing services in the field of architecture.\\"\\"Environment Committee to discuss Building Control Act 2007 with architects‚Äô groups\\", see related web page from the Government web page. The Joint Committee on the Environment agreed to establish an informal working group to request the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government to take special consideration of the situation of long- standing practitioners in the field of architecture. The group shall work with all the stakeholders to provide a solution, on a strictly once-off basis. The group shall ensure that this process is open, fair and transparent and that the costs involved are reduced to the minimum possible and that any unnecessary costs, administration and red tape are avoided. The Committee agreed the informal working group would be composed of: Deputy Luke Flanagan IND; Deputy Sandra McLellan SF; Deputy Ged Nash LAB; Senator C√°it Keane FG.See latest news from AAoI website dated 17 July 2012 =AAoI actions and related events 2013=Independent Review The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan, T.D., appointed Garrett Fennell Solicitor to conduct an independent review of the arrangements for the registration of Architects under the Building Control Act 2007.More information about the independent review can be accessed from the RIAI website Garrett Fennell is currently serving as chairperson of the Admissions Board established for the Statutory Register. The terms of reference to the Review were as follows: 1\\\\. To carry out an independent review of the arrangements generally for the registration of Architects under the Building Control Act 2007 2\\\\. To take stock of the overall experience to date in relation to the operation of the registration system with a view to seeing how the system can be further improved. 3\\\\. Having regard to the lower than expected number of applications from practically trained architects, to review and make specific recommendation on how the registration of practically trained architects can be better encouraged. The AAoI and anyone concerned were invited to make a submission for consideration on or before 10 May 2013 to architectsreview@environ.. Information submitted are subject to the Freedom of Information Acts and may be placed in the public domain. Administrative assistance in relation to this review was provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but Garrett Fennell Solicitor's consideration, treatment and report on the issues raised will be prepared in line with the Terms of Reference and independently of the Department and the registration body.AAoI Submission to the independent review can be accessed from AAoI website On 03/09/2013 Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor, issued his report for the independent review.A copy of the report can be accessed from the Department of the Environment website The Report was published on 24/09/2013 with a Press Notice.The Press Notice can be accessed from the Department of the Environment website Report from The Joint Committee on the Environment on 17 July 2013, The Joint Committee on the Environment issued its report on the Title of \\"Architect\\".JOINT COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE AND THE GAELTACHT 31ST D√ÅIL √âIREANN / 24TH SEANAD √âIREANN REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE TITLE OF ARCHITECT JULY 2013 The 54 pages report includes over 15 formal recommendations in relation to the existing legislation (the Building Control Act 2007) which gave protection to the 'title' of architect. One of the recommendations to the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, gives consideration to the inclusion of a typical, self- extinguishing ‚Äògrandfather‚Äô clause in the Building Control Act 2007 ‚Äì as is provided in other States' legislation. Another recommendation is for the Technical Assessment Board to advise on the applicability of Irish law and how it facilitates or not the easy transfer of skills across the European Union and the recognition of skills gained outside Ireland and in Ireland. During the meeting held on 17 July, Michael McCarthy TD, Cathaoirleach of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, said: \\"When a State starts to protect the use of the term ‚ÄòArchitect‚Äô and confines it to those on the architects‚Äô register, issues can arise relating to the position of existing self-trained practitioners, colloquially termed ‚Äògrandfathers‚Äô. These issues have been successfully addressed by other Member States in so-called ‚Äògrandfather‚Äô clauses in legislation.\\"Refer to AAoI Website News Page, entry date 17 July 2013 =AAoI actions and related events 2014= In 2014, AAoI launched a website to inform the public on the direction taken by the Irish government to reinforce building control in the Republic of Ireland.the website can be accessed at http://si9.ie/ Statutory Instrument No.19 of 2014The document is published here: http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0019.pdf is a final action from the Irish Government to prevent members of AAoI offering services in Ireland. Despite having always claimed to protect the title \\"architect\\" without taking away the rights of AAoI members as professionals practicing architecture in the State, the Minister for the Environment signed a statutory instrument which now deprives professionally trained architects from their rights to design and to oversee the construction of a project. The AAoI strongly opposed the new legislation which was enforced despite strong opposition from other groupsmany professionals and members of the public involved with building their own houses or extensions have expressed concerns about the new legislation. Some of the concerns can be accessed on the Bregs forum and despite The Competition Authority warning which explained that: \\"As a general principle, new legislation should not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the pool of people eligible to offer a service.\\"Refer to: \\"Consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 - Submission to Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government\\"  Critics and oppositions  The architectural professional bodies assert that, until the 2007 Act, clients were put at risk from \\"cowboy\\" operators and there were no disciplinary controls over individuals outside the professional bodies. The RIAI oppose the proposed amendment of the Building Control Act 2007. Their position is that:\\" The Building Control Act marks a key shift in widening access to the profession by introducing access to those who have not pursued the standard higher education route. There is a registered admission examination and technical assessment. Up to 1966, entry to the architecture profession could be gained through the RIAI examination system but there has been a general shift towards formal qualifications. The pendulum has swung back to some degree with the shift to an outcomes-based assessment in higher education and away from the input model. The Building Control Act has both models, input from qualifications and output based on the assessment obtained without formal education.\\"This is a quote from the RIAI director during the Joint Committee on the Environment. It can be verified in the Videos or in the Minutes of Dail Committee Meeting. The RIAI opposed John O'Donoghue's Private Member's Bill the Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2010. A private member's Bill that can be brought to the D√°il by any single TD and the behest of his supporters. The Institute's position is that John O'Donoghue's proposed amendment to the current legislation, if enacted, would be in breach of EU law.\\"AG counsels caution on architect registration\\" published in the Sunday Business Post -20 February 2011 The Institute organised political lobbying against John O'Donoghue's Private Member's Bill issuing statements that the proposed amendment damages Irish architects and Irish architecture, that it undermines consumers' protection, and that it disadvantages younger architectural graduates.\\"What is wrong with the proposed amendment?\\" as published on RIAI website  Status  The number of individuals and practices joining the association has grown from a dozen to more than a hundred. Some registered architects and many engineers, technicians or surveyors and others are also supporting the cause of AAoI.See AAoI presentation during the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Debate (18 May 2010) The association declares \\"protecting diversity and promoting choice in Irish Architecture\\", it also claims \\"promoting and protecting the provision of architectural services in Ireland\\". Some members have suggested that the group should develop into a professional representative body.

Biddle (born January 19, 1959) is an American author, historian, policy analyst and columnist whose work concentrates on U.S. foreign policy. Currently, he is the Professor of International and Public Affairs at School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University. He is perhaps best known for his award-winning 2004 book Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle, published through Princeton University Press. He also has worked in groups under Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus forming U.S. counter-insurgency policy. Background=Education and early career= Biddle was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Robert D. and Blanche V. Biddle. His parents frequently discussed politics, and they welcomed his input. Biddle later remarked that such debates took place \\"from almost as far back as I can remember\\" and that his father expressly encouraged him to think for himself. Biddle spent a lot of his childhood reading about military history and foreign affairs. Biddle worked in internships in Washington D.C. that involved studying U.S. defense policy, but he remained skeptical as to whether he could (as he later put it) \\"actually make a living and pay the rent and eat regularly while doing this.\\" Biddle earned a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts from Harvard, which had mostly involved reviewing art history, in 1981. His first job after earning his degree was at a public policy think tank in the Washington, D.C. area that worked with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He went on to operate 400,000-line Fortran models of combat scenarios outcomes between the Warsaw Pact and NATO from 1981 to 1983. Biddle's suspicions about the model's accuracy and about Defense Department statistical planning in general would later inspire the material in his first book, Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle. Biddle earned a Master's Degree in 1985 and then a Doctor of Philosophy in 1992, both of those degrees coming from Harvard and both focusing on American public policy. He later joked, \\"I got to know every bad restaurant in Harvard Square very well by the time I was done!\\" Biddle felt particularly inspired by mentor professors Albert Carnesale and Michael Nacht, political science experts who have since moved to U.C. Berkeley. =Later career= Biddle served as Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs before joining the faculty of School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University in 2018. He joined the faculty there in August 2012, after serving as the Roger Hertog Senior Fellow for Defense Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which he joined in January 2006. He retains an affiliation with the Council as Adjunct Senior Fellow for Defense Policy. He formerly worked as an associate professor and Elihu Root chair of military studies at the U.S. Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute. His popular interest writings have appeared in multiple publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe, The International Herald Tribune, and The Guardian. Biddle's career has also included research and teaching posts at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs (BCSIA), and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government's Office of National Security Programs. He published Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle through Princeton University Press in 2004. The book has won multiple writing awards including CFR's Arthur Ross Award Silver Medal for 2005 and the 2005 Huntington Prize from the Olin Institute for Strategic Studies. Biddle received the U.S. Army Superior Civilian Service Medal in 2003 and again in 2006. He received the U.S. Army Commander's Award for Public Service in 2007 as well. Within the U.S. military, he served on General Stanley McChrystal's Initial Strategic Assessment Team in Kabul in 2009, on General David Petraeus's Joint Strategic Assessment Team in Baghdad in 2007, and as a senior adviser to General Petraeus's Central Command Assessment Team in Washington in 2008‚Äì2009. Beliefs Biddle stated in 2006 that the George W. Bush administration did not do \\"an adequate job\\" of establishing a grand strategy for the war on terror with specific aims and specifically defined enemies. He criticized the administration's approach as \\"quite vague\\". He called the Bush doctrine of 'rollback', in which the U.S. tries to end the root cause of terrorism by replacing failing autocracies in the Arab world with democracies, \\"a very demanding program\\" but a legitimate, if costly and risky, view. He also remarked in 2006 that the War in Afghanistan had progressively grown more difficult for American forces since, at first, they fought untrained, amateur Taliban-related militants. Yet later on, according to Biddle, American forces began fighting well-trained foreign agents such as al-Qaeda operatives that incorporate Western-style infantry tactics. Biddle referred to the Afghan war in mid-2009 as \\"perhaps the most controversial and divisive issue in U.S. defense policy\\".

Less than a day after the condemnation from the Security Council, illicit weapons continued to flow into Somalia. Observations The Security Council offered its support of the Somali reconciliation process, including the ongoing Somali National Reconciliation Conference. It condemned the illegal flow of weapons into and through Somalia in violation of the arms embargo, calling for improvements to be made to the monitoring of the embargo and urging states to enforce the restrictions. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council stressed that all countries should comply with the embargo. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to re-establish a monitoring group to monitor the implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia, update lists on those violating the sanctions, to co-operate with a Committee established in Resolution 751 (1992) and make recommendations. The Committee was also asked to make recommendations on ways of improving the effectiveness of the embargo. Finally, the Committee was requested to consider a visit to Somalia to demonstrate the Council's determination to enforce the arms embargo.

In Australia, landholders work together across boundaries to sustainably harvest or make use of (ecotourism) naturally occurring wildlife populations such as the kangaroo. Important to the concept is that biodiversity and environmental benefit occurs via alternative land uses. Attaching a value to native resources through commercial development has the potential to provide alternative sources of income, especially in areas where traditional systems are no longer as profitable or environmentally sustainable. The Sustainable Wildlife Enterprise system enables farmers to realise the financial value of native wildlife such as the kangaroo and encourages them to manage their land that supports the source of the income without lowering total farm profitability ‚Äì hence contributing to habitat and biodiversity conservation. The Sustainable Wildlife Enterprise system has been developed in Australia but is based on world-wide experiences. Background Until primary production systems can put a value on habitat and conservation areas there will be more and more species loss. Conventional farming techniques have seen broad-scale environmental degradation in Australia‚Äôs rangelands, particularly during droughts where soil fertility and low rainfall limit natural production capacity. Where native wildlife and resources are given a value and managed sustainably, there is a proven benefit for biodiversity and habitat.Ampt, P and Baumber, A, Building Cooperation and Collaboration in the Kangaroo Industry: http://rirdc.gov.auCooney, R., Baumber, A., Ampt, P. and Wilson, G.

In Scotland, deer stalking and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) hunting occurs sustainably because hunting licences are owned by the landholder. This provides incentives to the landholder to protect their source of income and the habitat which the animals live on.Newey S, Dahl F, Kurki S (eds) (2010).

Kangaroos impact less on the environment than hoofed animals and emit substantially less methane. There is currently a sustainable kangaroo harvesting industry in place in Australia. See the Kangaroo industry.Kangaroo Wildlife Trade http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/trade-use/wild- harvest/kangaroo/index.html Landholders do not control or receive benefit from harvest of kangaroos on their land other than reduction of grazing pressure under this system.

Through improved information and training, quality of kangaroo products can be ensured through traceback and temperature tracking systems. The highly trained operatives within the cooperative also guarantee humane treatment of the animals. The cooperative assess kangaroo populations and develop and implement best-practice quality standards, which include standards of animal selection, harvesting, field dressing, transport, chilling and traceback from processors. Landholders benefit by the amount of kangaroo harvested on their land, and as a proportion of their investment and involvement.Commercial and Sustainable Use of Wildlife -Suggestions to improve conservation, land management and rural economies https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/08-199 There are a number of ways these cooperatives can be set up and the profits shared.Cooney R (2008). Commercial and Sustainable Use of Wildlife - Suggestions to improve conservation, land management and rural economies https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/08-199 Products from SWEs often need to have a market edge so landholders and harvesters can both benefit. The cooperatives need to prove biodiversity and environmental benefit, reduced carbon emissions, humane treatment of the animals, transparent operations and the highest quality. Landholders benefit from better management of total grazing pressure and profits from sale of kangaroo products. Harvesters can benefit by gaining exclusive secure rights to properties and regular income, reward for implementing higher professional standards and access to training and development, resources, information, equipment, share in profits produced by ensuring market edge products. Meat processors can benefit with accurately described high quality products. For Landcare Australia groups and regional/catchment natural resource management bodies, the model offers options to meet their objectives of management of total grazing pressure), feral animals and weeds, diversification of incomes and socio-economic resilience. Carbon benefits How a co-operative may work The development of the Australian carbon market The Australian Government‚Äôs Carbon Farming Initiative http://www.climatechange.gov.au/cfi makes the prospect of profitable use of Australian wildlife within farming systems more viable. Methane from the foregut of ruminant livestock cattle and sheep constitutes 11% of Australia‚Äôs total greenhouse gas emissions. Kangaroos, on the other hand, have less impact on the environment and are non-ruminant forestomach fermenters that produce negligible amounts of methane. As community groups call for reduced consumption of ruminant red meat to reduce carbon emissions, kangaroo meat consumption is a healthy,O'dea, K., Sinclair, A., Niall, M. and Traianedes, K. 1986.

Providing consumers with a red meat alternative (protein) that is associated with far lower methane emissions and minimal soil damage is an important environmental outcome Cooney R, Archer M, Baumber A, Ampt P, Wilson G, Smits J, Webb G and Grigg G (in press 2011). THINKK again: getting the facts straight on kangaroo harvesting and conservation. Wildlife Under Siege 2011 Where kangaroo production partially replaces average sheep/cattle meat production, carbon credits can be earned. In the jargon of the carbon trade, sustainable kangaroo use in lieu of sheep/cattle provides landholders the ability to prove additionality and stop market leakage in protein production. There are also considerable carbon credit potentials in soil and vegetation as a result of managing the landscape for native wildlife (e.g. conversion to permanent native pastures).Wilson, G. and Edwards, M.

The aim of his work is to retrieve the unity of spiritual practice, science and culture found in philosophers of the premodern and particularly the Dominican tradition (e.g. in Thomas Aquinas and Meister Eckhart). In line with this aim, he argues in his most recent publications that we need to develop a ‚Äòpost-digital rationality‚Äô that is consistent with the spiritual and virtue ethical cultivation of our intuitive intelligence, and governed by our natural desire for the true, the beautiful and the good.Johannes Hoff: Liturgical Turn: Gottesrede in einer post-digitalen Welt.

In: Internationale Katholische Zeitschrift Communio. Band 46, Nr. 3, S. 299‚Äì312. The IT technologies of our present time are more than mere tools; they have a magic life on their own. According to Hoff, this requires us to recover our ability to distinguish between malevolent objects, that are designed to engender idolatrous attachments, and benevolent objects, that support our desire to transform our life to the better. In the wake of the confessionalization of religions in the post-Reformation era we have, according to Hoff, unlearnt the art of discernment.Johannes Hoff: The Eclipse of Sacramental Realism in the Age of Reform. Re-thinking Luther's Gutenberg Galaxy in a Post-Digital Age. Hrsg.: New Blackfriars. 2018 Yet, the modern conviction that we are ‚Äòautonomous subjects‚Äô disguised that fact that our life has become increasingly governed by bureaucratic strategies of surveillance and control. According to Hoff, the digitisation of these strategies reveals their true character: The ‚Äòdisenchantment‚Äô of the Enlightenment tradition has turned into a kind of ‚Äòbad magic‚Äô that needs to be counterbalanced by a sacramental re- enchantment. Since we had stopped inhabiting a 'disenchanted' world, we would need to rethink the old tradition of the Discernment of Spirits: \\"Our smartphones have a 'magic life' of their own ‚Äì be it that they afford a life that we appreciate, or that they nudge us into a life that we abhor. This challenge requires us to recover our ability to distinguish between idolatrous attachments and the prudent use of 'magic objects' that is consistent with our natural desire to transform our life for the better.\\"The Eclipse of Sacramental Realism in the Age of Reform.

Partially due to having been inspired by painter Adolphe Monticelli, Van Gogh sought the Provence region of France to further expand his painting skill and experience. Van Gogh used several pairs of complementary colors in the Farmhouse in Provence, the color contrast bringing an intensity to his work. The painting is owned by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. Arles At the time that Van Gogh painted Farmhouse in Provence, he was 35 years old. Living in Arles, in southern France, he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work, such as fields, farmhouses and people of the Arles, N√Æmes and Avignon area. The area was quite different than what he'd known in the Netherlands and Paris. The climate was hot and dry. People had dark hair and skin and spoke a different language than Parisian French. The colors were vivid. The terrain varied from plains to mountains. Here Van Gogh found a \\"brilliance and light that would wash out details and simplify forms, reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks\\" and where the \\"effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of composition and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts.\\" A prolific time, in less than 444 days Vincent made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings Yet, he still wrote more than 200 letters. He described a series of seven studies of wheat fields as, \\"landscapes, yellow‚Äîold gold‚Äîdone quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping.\\" In a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \\"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle‚Äîmore like music and less like sculpture‚Äîand above all, it promises color.\\" The painting Van Gogh used three pairs of complementary, or contrasting, colors which when sat together intensified the brilliance and intensity of one another's colors. One pair is orange and blue. Another would be the red and green of the plants. Last, pink clouds against the turquoise sky. Van Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to bring an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work. Two complementary colors of the same degree of vividness and brightness placed next to one another produce an intense reaction, called the \\"law of simultaneous contrast.\\" Van Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of \\"a wedding of two complementary colors, their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls.\\" While in Nuenen Van Gogh became familiar with Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul's laws in weaving to maximize the intensity of colors through their contrast to adjacent colors. In Paris he was exposed through his brother Theo to Adolphe Monticelli's still life work with flowers, which he admired. First, he saw Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast. Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint. It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence. He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that he wrote in a letter to his sister Wil that he felt as if he were \\"Monticelli's son or his brother.\\" Provenance The National Gallery of Art reports the correct sequence of ownership for the painting is: * Johanna van Gogh-Bonger (1862‚Äì1925), the artist's sister-in-law, of Amsterdam sold the painting in November 1890 through Julien Tanguy Gallery, Paris to Willy Gretor, also known as Wilhelm Rudolph Julius Petersen (1868-1923) of Paris. Five paintings that were sold by Johanna became part of the National Gallery of Art collection. * Willy Gretor gifted the painting to Maria Slavona, a German painter, of Paris and Berlin. It was one of many gifts of Van Gogh paintings by Willie to Maria, with whom he had a daughter, Lilly. Maria then married Otto Ackermann (1871‚Äì1963), an art dealer of Paris and Berlin. * From 1919 to at least 1933 Gaston Bernheim de Villers (1870‚Äì1953) of Paris owned the painting. * The painting was sold to Capt. Edward H. Molyneux (1891‚Äì1974) of Paris. * It was then sold August 15, 1955 to Ailsa Mellon Bruce (1901‚Äì1969) of New York. * In 1970 it was bequeathed to the National Gallery of Art, part of the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Collection. Another sequence of ownership was given by J.-B. de la Faille in The Works of Vincent van Gogh, His Paintings and Drawings‚Äîa portion of which was apparently in error (i.e., Bernheim-Jeune, Reid and Lefevre, Ackermann, Molyneux.)J.B. de la Faille.

It was founded in 1857. Membership is voluntary, and all school employees can join. KEA has satellites in every school district of Kentucky and is an affiliate of the National Education Association. It is the largest professional group in the state. Organization KEA is divided into 13 separate districts, each governed by an elected board of directors. KEA also elects members to its policy making arm, the Delegate Assembly, which is held each year, and to the National Education Association's representative delegation. KEA runs 15 offices throughout Kentucky and employs over 55 staff members under an Executive Director. KEA's president and vice president are allowed to work full-time for KEA rather than holding normal classroom positions. Political influence KEA's political unit is called the Kentucky Educators' Political Action Committee (KEPAC) It was an FEC-registered federal Political Action Committee during the 2000 and 2008 elections. In the 2008 election, KEA spent over $27,000 to send direct mail to influence its members to vote for U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Lunsford. The Richmond Register reported some influence on the 2011 Kentucky gubernatorial election over the issue of funding for education. In 2011 the KEA pressed Kentucky lawmakers not to proceed with proposed cuts to the education budget, but the bill passed on March 2, 2011. Earlier in 2011 the KEA withdrew their opposition to Senate Bill 12, which would give authority for school superintendents rather than school councils to hire principals, to focus on issues of education funding. In 2008 KEA/KEPAC was ranked as the number-three political action committee in Kentucky, having spent $286,014 in the state. In 2010, the organization spent $435,291.18 on state political activities and ended the year with $451,575.66 of funds. =Historical= In 1911, KEA elected its first female president, Cora Wilson Stewart. In 1913, KEA was criticized for not fully supporting the women's suffrage movement in Kentucky. The Lexington Leader claimed it was because it would mean equal rights and therefore higher pay to female teachers. KEA denied the allegation. In 1955, KEA successfully lobbied both gubernatorial candidates to pledge an increase of $20 million to public schools in Kentucky. In 1968, KEA helped to push through an increase to the state's sales tax (to 5%) to provide additional funding for education. The group organized a widespread teacher's strike in the state in 1970 to demand a pay raise. Throughout the 1970s, KEA tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to get a bill giving teachers the right to unionization. This fight resulted in numerous work stoppages. In 1985 the KEA successfully lobbied for an education bill to pass. In 1987, KEA backed a Republican governor (John Harper) for the first time in their 13-year history of gubernatorial endorsement.

The email backbone is normally the portion of the email infrastructure that \\"sits between\\" the gateway DMZ layer and the ‚Äúemail groupware system‚Äù layer of the messaging infrastructure, such as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes/Domino. The email backbone is sometimes referred to as the messaging fabric or a messaging infrastructure layerhttp://www.irg-intl.com/whitepaper/2010-Messaging-Fabric.html Email backbone infrastructure and cloud computing Many businesses are either considering or are actively migrating to cloud-based email because it can offer a number of important benefits. These benefits may include lower cost of ownership, more predictable costs, the shift from a capital expenditure (CAPEX) to an operational cost (OPEX) model, and less demand for internal IT resources. The typical email infrastructure functions that are moved to the cloud include the email filtering layer for spam and virus protection, message archiving and the \\"email groupware system\\" mailboxes. The email backbone layer typically stays on on-premises. Email backbone infrastructure and on- premises computing The benefits of moving email to the cloud are compelling and quantifiable, but there are advantages to keeping the email backbone layer of the messaging infrastructure on-premises while leveraging cloud-based services for common email functions such as spam and virus filtering and the end user mailbox system, such as Microsoft Exchange. For example, an on- premises email backbone can provide policy management to enforce outbound messaging policies, such as encrypting sensitive messages, before the contents of the email leaves the organization. Other benefits of an on-premises email backbone include the ability to manage a wide variety of mobile platforms at potentially lower cost, the ability to maintain legacy records management systems, and integration with existing voicemail systems. Further, many organizations have complex routing and SMTP application requirements that require the use of an email backbone even after key parts of the email infrastructure have been migrated to the cloud. For example, routing and control requirements can be quite complex and often cannot be satisfied by cloud-based email systems. Examples of these requirements include: * Appending required disclaimers on outbound messages that are specific to particular countries to which emails are sent. * Establishing ethical walls between parts of an organization (such as the trading and transmission operations of an energy provider) to remain in compliance with statutory obligations. * Management of application-to-human communications, such as transaction alerts or communications from various types of office equipment (printers, scanners, copiers, etc.) * Human-to-application messages, such as communications with an automated help desk system, IT support applications with which employees and other communicate, or CRM systems. * Management of critical application-to- application communications, such as wire transfers between banks. * Email header address re-writing in order to preserve multiple domains. Hybrid cloud and on-premises email architecture At the enterprise level, the choice about how to manage email is not a decision about on-premises or cloud, but rather which services will remain on-premises and which will be managed in the cloud.http://www.cioupdate.com/trends/article.php/3858011/How-Cloud-and-On- Premise-Platforms-Work-Together.htm Over the next several years, email management will evolve toward a hybrid model using an Email Backbone for virtually all but the smallest organizations.

It was released on June 7, 2011, by independent French record label Season of Mist. It is Morbid Angel's first album since Heretic (2003), the band's longest gap to date between studio albums. This is the only Morbid Angel album to feature guitarist Destructhor and drummer Tim Yeung, making it their first not to feature Pete Sandoval, who was recovering from surgery. It is also the band's only album to feature bassist/vocalist David Vincent since he rejoined in 2004. Illud Divinum Insanus (That Divine Insane One) is grammatically incorrect Latin. \\"Illud\\" and \\"Divinum\\" are in the neuter gender, but the \\"Insanus\\" is masculine. \\"Insanus\\" being an adjective, \\"Divinum\\" (which can be a noun or an adjective) is the noun (neuter here) in the sentence, so Illud Divinum Insanum is correct.http://misterbooze.blogspot.com/2013/03/latin-grammar-with-morbid- angel.html (Alternatively, Ille divinus insanus would be acceptable, if the object is taken to be a masculine individual. Nevertheless, the adjective must correspond with the noun in gender.) Recording and production Illud Divinum Insanus is the band's only album featuring second guitarist Destructhor, the first with bassist/vocalist David Vincent since Domination (1995), and the first not recorded with longtime drummer Pete Sandoval, who had undergone back surgery when recording began. Former Hate Eternal drummer Tim Yeung recorded the drum tracks for this album. Illud Divinum Insanus took more than five years to materialize. Work on the album began in 2006, and it was originally going to be released in 2007, but was pushed back several times while the band continued touring and writing new material. After four years of writing, Morbid Angel recorded the album from June 2010 to January 2011 at several studios, including Mana Recording Studios and Red Room Studios for the drum recording, and D.O.W. Studios for the bass, guitars, and vocals. The record was mixed in Hollywood, California, with Sean Beavan. Promotion and release \\"Nevermore\\" single cover. The cover art for the album was unveiled on March 30, 2011. It was designed by Brazilian artist Gustavo Sazes, who commented: The album's track listing and information of various release formats were unveiled on April 5, 2011. Prior to the release of the album, a single for the song \\"Nevermore\\" was made available on May 16 as a digital download and on 7\\" vinyl. The cover artwork for the single was designed by French artists Valnoir and Fursy Teyssier for Metastazis. The single also contains an exclusive version of the song \\"Destructos vs. the Earth\\", remixed by Combichrist. In 2012, a double remix album called Illud Divinum Insanus ‚Äì The Remixes was released. Reception The album received mixed reviews from critics and generated a strong backlash from fans, many of whom were dissatisfied with the group's attempt to add an industrial element to the album. Louisville Music News labeled the album a \\"failed experiment\\" and a \\"joke\\", and described Illud Divinum Insanus as Morbid Angel's St. Anger, in reference to the Metallica album. Metal Injection gave the album 3/10 and described the album as \\"a joke\\" and an \\"overall bummer to listen to.\\" They criticised the lack of heavy, interesting guitarwork and Pete Sandoval's absence from the album, writing that \\"Instead, we‚Äôre left with fifty-six plodding minutes of (mostly) forgettable death metal and/or offensively terrible industrial metal.\\" They also highlighted David Vincent's lyrics for particular criticism, describing them as \\"atrocious\\" and \\"pretty awful pretty much the entire time\\". Blabbermouth criticised the album, particularly for the programmed drums, and argued that even the four best tracks on the album sounded \\"uninspired and even if the band dumped blood, sweat and tears into these songs, that still wouldn't make up for the fact that a track like \\"Radikult\\" takes up space on the same album.\\" Conversely, Phil Freeman of Allmusic said that while \\"those who love the band's earliest records...are bound to see Illud Divinum Insanus experiments with industrial...as betrayals of everything the group once stood for\\", \\"many of the songs on Illud...are as raw and savage as anything the band's ever recorded\\", and that the album is \\"a left turn by a band that's already made many of them throughout its...career\\". Metal Hammer gave 9/10, describing the album as \\"a twisted, confrontational masterpiece\\". The album received praise before its release from artists including Mikael √Ökerfeldt from Opeth, Anders Nystr√∂m from Katatonia and several other metal artists. However, drummer Pete Sandoval disliked the album, saying, \\"I don't know why they did that with the DJs, they could've have [sic] just done a separate project without calling it a Morbid Angel album. That might have been better.\\" Sandoval was unable to contribute to the recording of Illud Divinum Insanus due to injuries, and later left the band entirely. Guitarist Trey Azagthoth calls the album \\"a confused effort\\", whose unfocused direction ultimately led to David Vincent's departure in 2015, and offers no apologies over the computerized beats and effects, with a comment about the song \\"Radikult\\", calling it \\"a silly song\\", \\"...I had nothing to do with that thing.\\" Track listingPersonnel=Morbid Angel= *David Vincent ‚Äì bass, vocals, keyboards *Trey Azagthoth ‚Äì guitars *Destructhor ‚Äì guitars =Session musician= *Tim Yeung ‚Äì drums =Production= *Sean Beavan ‚Äì engineering, mixing *Gunter Ford ‚Äì management *Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez ‚Äì engineering *Mark Prator ‚Äì engineering *Erik Rutan ‚Äì engineering *Gustavo Sazes ‚Äì cover art, design References Morbid Angel albums 2011 albums Season of Mist albums Industrial metal albums ","title":"Illud Divinum Insanus"},{"id":"31289263","text":"Auscultation can be performed upon the skull to check for intracranial bruits.

Written in 1927, it achieved instant and long-lasting popularity on its appearance on the concert stage in 1929. It is an example of symphonic jazz, not unlike the style of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, although it is very much Lambert's individual conception. It combines jazzy syncopation with lithe Latin American dance rhythms that create an air of haunting nostalgia. The Rio Grande is set to the impressionistic poem of the same name by Sacheverell Sitwell, and takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes to perform. This piece was dedicated to Angus Morrison, who played at its first performance. Style The Rio Grande is scored for alto soloist, mixed chorus, piano, brass, strings and a percussion section of 15 instruments, requiring five players. It combines jazzy syncopations, ragtime and Brazilian influences, harmonies and rhythms inspired by Duke Ellington, with a traditional English choral sound. The outer sections are brisk, surrounding a central nocturne. The piano part often plays triplets against duplets, redolent of a rumba. The coda is based on material from the central section. Lambert noted in a 1928 article: Music critic Christopher Palmer said of this piece that The poem refers to a river in Brazil, although there is no Brazilian river called Rio Grande.Villa-Lobos Website Creation The idea for this piece began when in 1923 Lambert attended Will Vodery‚Äôs Plantation Orchestra. He later wrote: ‚ÄòAfter the humdrum playing of the English orchestra in the first half, it was electrifying to hear Will Vodery‚Äôs band in the Delius-like fanfare which preluded the second. It definitely opened up a new world of sound.‚Äô That \\"new world of sound\\" is the syncopated jazz sound that he would incorporate in The Rio Grande. While George Gershwin was clearly a major influence, Vodery's mention shows us that besides Gershwin, the entire jazz and Broadway zeitgeist of the day served as the influence for this piece. Frederick Delius also served as an inspiration. The chorus‚Äôs fortissimo opening statement is a direct transcription of the fanfare that appears frequently in Delius' work (the famous \\"Walk to the Paradise Garden\\" from A Village Romeo and Juliet, to quote just one instance, has it in almost every bar). Delius knew much about spirituals from living among African-Americans in Florida. Premieres Hamilton Harty Its first performance was a BBC Radio broadcast on 27 February 1928. The piano soloist was Angus Morrison,Morrison taught piano at London's Royal College of Music from 1926 to 1972. Although he largely shunned a concert career, he became friends with several British composers of his generation, notably Constant Lambert and William Walton. For his services to English music Morrison was awarded a CBE in 1979.

It was repeated at the subsequent Hall√© concert the following month. The first performance in Canada, and in North America, was on 11 February 1930, with Ernest Seitz and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Its first performance in New York City was in May 2018, when the Hunter College Choir, conducted by the Paul F. Mueller, performed this piece alongside Rossini's Stabat Mater. Reception This is generally considered Constant Lambert's most famous work. Lambert intended Summer's Last Will and Testament to be his masterpiece but, to his chagrin, it never surpassed The Rio Grande in popularity.1001 Classical Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die, Matthew Rye Recordings The composer made two recordings of The Rio Grande as conductor, both of which have held their place in the catalogue: * 11 January 1930: Albert Walter Whitehead (male alto; also seen as A.

It was built in 1884 for Sir George Bowen Simpson to a design by John Horbury Hunt in the Victorian Free Gothic style. Simpson named the house after Cloncorrick Castle in Ireland, where his grandfather once lived. The home was the residence of several notable Australians and is considered to be a house of local historic significance. It has been converted into two apartments. Heritage listing On 2 April 1999 was listed on the Woollahra Council local government list of the New South Wales Heritage Database with the following statement of significance: Owners=Sir George and Lady Simpson= Sir George Bowen Simpson, . George Bowen Simpson was born in 1838 near Parramatta. His father was Pierce Simpson, a police magistrate, and his mother was Hester Elizabeth MacNeill. George was educated at Kings School, Parramatta, and was admitted to the bar in 1858. In 1861 Simpson married Martha Margaret Cobcroft, who was the daughter of Enoch Cobcroft of Cumberland Hall, East Maitland.Sydney Morning Herald, 14 October 1861, p. 1. The couple had two children, a boy and a girl; both died when they were young. The daughter was only fifteen when she died and the son was 34. They had no immediate heirs. Simpson became a very successful lawyer and in 1867 was made a district court judge. In 1885 he became a politician in the New South Wales Legislative Council and soon became attorney-general. In 1894 he became a judge of the Supreme Court. In 1909 he was knighted but because of poor health he retired in 1910. He spent his remaining years at Cloncorrick, and he died in 1915. His wife Martha continued to live at Cloncorrick after his death. One of her main interests was the work done at St Marks Church, Darling Point.Sydney Morning Herald, 26 July 1933, p. 17.

It is a peptide analog that has been shown to increase gap junction intercellular conductance in cardiac muscle cells.Shiroshita-Takeshita A, Sakabe M, Haugan K, Hennan J, Nattel S (2007). Model- Dependent Effects of the Gap Junction Conduction‚ÄìEnhancing Antiarrhythmic Peptide Rotigaptide (ZP123) on Experimental Atrial Fibrillation in Dogs. Circulation. 115: 310- 318. Gap junctions are protein channels that are responsible for conducting electrical impulses between cells in the heart to maintain normal rhythm. Gap junction modulation is a promising and novel mechanism of action for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Its peptide sequence is Ac-D-Tyr-D-Pro-D-Hyp-Gly-D- Ala-Gly-NH2.  Indications  Rotigaptide is being studied for its antiarrhythmic effects, specifically for treating atrial fibrillation.Guerra J, Everett T, Lee K, Wilson E, Olgin J (2006). Effects of the Gap Junction Modifier Rotigaptide (ZP123) on Atrial Conduction and Vulnerability to Atrial Fibrillation. Circulation. 114: 110-118. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm. The irregular rhythm, results from abnormal electrical impulses in the heart. The irregularity can be continuous or intermittent. In atrial fibrillation, multiple impulses travel through the atria at the same time. Instead of a coordinated contraction, the atrial contractions are irregular, disorganized and very rapid. These irregular impulses reach the AV node in rapid succession, but not all of them make it past the AV node. Therefore, the ventricles beat slower in an irregular rhythm. The resulting rapid, irregular heartbeat causes an irregular pulse and sometimes a sensation of fluttering in the chest.  Mechanism of action  A gap junction in a cell membrane The exact mechanism of action of rotigaptide is not completely understood. However, rotigaptide is believed to exert its effects on cardiomyocyte gap junctions through phosphorylation events. Each gap junction is composed of a series of connexons in close proximity to each other. Each connexon is made up of 6 functional units (connexins) that associate together to form a channel between adjacent cells.Verheule S, van Kempen MJ, te Welscher PH, Kwak BR, Jongsma HJ (1997). Characterization of gap junction channels in adult rabbit atrial and ventricular myocardium. Circulation Research. 80(5): 673-681. Rotigaptide acts at connexins, preferentially to connexin 43 (Cx43).Hennan K, Swillo R, Morgan G, Keith J, Schaub R, Smith R, Feldman H, Haugan K, Kantrowitz J, Wang P, Abu-Qare A, Butera J, Larsen B, Crandall D (2006). Rotigaptide (ZP123) Prevents Spontaneous Ventricular Arrhythmias and Reduces Infarct Size During Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Open-Chest Dogs. JPET. 317: 236‚Äì 243. Treatment with rotigaptide has been shown to activate various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms to cause the phosphorylation of Cx43, which aids in proper function of the connexon.Axelsen L, Stahlhut M, Mohammed S, Due Larsen B, Nielsen M, Holstein-Rathlou NH, S√∏ren Andersen, Jensen O, Hennan J, Kj√∏lbye A (2006). Identification of ischemia-regulated phosphorylation sites in connexin43: A possible target for the antiarrhythmic peptide analogue rotigaptide (ZP123). Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology. 40: 790-798. This allows for a smoother conduction to pass through the myocytes to propagate a synchronous contraction.Clarke T, Thomas D, Petersen J, Evans W, Martin P (2006). The antiarrhythmic peptide rotigaptide (ZP123) increases gap junction intercellular communication in cardiac myocytes and HeLa cells expressing connexin 43. British Journal of Pharmacology. 147: 486‚Äì495. This has been shown to reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation.  Limitations  A potential limitation for this drug is that animals being used for studies are most commonly anesthetized with isoflurane, which has been shown to be a partial gap junction uncoupler and thus would negate the effects of rotigaptide.Mantz J, Cordier J, Giaume C (1993). Effects of general anesthetics on inter-cellular communications mediated by gap junctions between astrocytes in primary culture. Anesthesiology. 78: 892‚Äì901. However, this effect can be only minor, as one study showed that a low dose of isoflurane was kept continuous over the progression of the study, indicating that the dose was not high enough to uncouple rotigaptide. Therefore, it may be unlikely that isoflurane plays a role in the results presented.

Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in √âtretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family. Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige). Similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin. Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.; ; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867‚Äì1893, see Moffett et al. 1999. This arbitrary time period was established for the first Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige exhibition, based on historical reports of severe winters collected by curators. The Magpie is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet. His first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with The Road in Front of Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter. The Magpie was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting. It was followed by The Red Cape (1869‚Äì1871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.Moffett et al. 1999, p. 86. The canvas of The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie perched on a gate formed in a wattle fence, as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows. The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul earlier in the century. At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings.Arts Council of Great Britain 1957, p. 43: \\"Perhaps Monet's greatest snow landscape.\\"; : \\"This, Monet's finest snowscape...\\"; : \\"...one of the most magnificent snow scenes in his entire oeuvre...\\" The painting was privately held until the Mus√©e d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection. Background In the late 1850s, French landscape painter Eug√®ne Boudin (1824-1898) introduced Monet (1840-1926) to the art of painting en plein air‚Äî\\"in the open air\\", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible metal paint tube (1841) and portable easel brought painting, formerly confined to studios, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. \\"If I have become a painter,\\" Monet said, \\"I owe it to Boudin.\\" A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur (1865 or 1867), Monet's first snowscape. The landscape paintings of Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819-1891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color.: \\"...Jongkind discovered how the so- called \\"local color\\" changes with the seasons...It suddenly came to him that for the artist appearance, not reality, was the determining factor...the only thing that did matter was the atmospheric condition at a given moment. He shared this revelation with Monet, who, in turn, experimented by making two paintings of a road in Normandy from the same vantage point‚Äîthe first one under a cloudy sky, and the second when the road was covered with snow.\\" \\"Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master,\\" Monet later reminisced. \\"It was he who completed the education of my eye\\". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif. Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) had been painting effets de neige, \\"snow effects\\", from as early as 1856,Courbet, Gustave (1856). Trees in the Snow. National Galleries of Scotland. in a landscape style preferred by Japanese, Dutch, and Flemish artists. Influenced by Courbet, Monet painted his first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur (1865 or 1867).Mus√©e d'Orsay : \\"With this choice of theme, Monet was following in the footsteps of Courbet who had tackled snowscapes in a number of genre scenes. But unlike the older painter, whose principal motif remained the stag and the hunter and who produced many anecdotal scenes, Monet painted an almost deserted landscape, where the cart and its occupant play a very minor role.\\" The painting was originally dated 1865 by Monet. However, correspondence by painter Alexandre Dubourg points to a later date of 1867. In , Eliza Rathbone notes that the date is disputed by scholars. A journalist observed: > We have only seen him once. It was in the winter, during several days of > snow, when communications were virtually at a standstill. It was cold enough > to split stones. We noticed a foot-warmer, then an easel, then a man, > swathed in three coats, his hands in gloves, his face half-frozen. It was M. > Monet, studying a snow effect. Published in October 1868, but the anecdote > is thought to refer to the previous winter. In A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, Monet avoided the usual hunting genre and motifs used by Courbet. Instead, he focused on light and color in a new way by reducing the number of shades. Monet chose an earth tone color scheme and increased the number of shades of blue to highlight reflections on the snow. Monet followed A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur with a notable series of snowscapes in 1867 including Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter. First √âtretat campaign In 1867, Monet's girlfriend, Camille Doncieux (1847-1879), gave birth to their son Jean in Paris. Lacking money, Monet returned to his father's house in Sainte-Adresse and lived with his aunt, leaving Doncieux and their child in Paris. Monet married Doncieux in 1870. Mme. Louis Joachim Gaudibert, an art collector, became Monet's first patron. Gaudibert helped Monet rent a house in √âtretat for Doncieux and Jean in late 1868. Recovering from an episode of depression, Monet joined Doncieux and Jean at the house in √âtretat in October, with Doncieux in the role of muse and life model. By December, Monet was in great spirits, \\"surrounded by everything that I love\\", and began to focus on painting. In a letter to Fr√©d√©ric Bazille (1841-1870), Monet wrote: The Luncheon (1868). Camille and son Jean in √âtretat.For an extended discussion of The Luncheon (Le Dejeuner) and how it fits into the timeline of the first √âtretat campaign, see: Wagner, Anne M. (1994) \\"Why Monet gave up figure painting.\\" Art Bulletin 74 (4): 612. . > I spend my time out in the open, on the shingle beach when the weather is > bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the countryside which is very > beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in > summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am > going to do some serious things.. See also: George, Serge (1996). Claude > Monet. Masterworks Series. Ramboro Books. p. 14. . Although he enjoyed living with Camille and Jean in √âtretat, Monet preferred to paint alone in the countryside. He told Bazille: > Don't you think that directly in nature and alone one does better?...I've > always been of this mind, and what I do under these conditions has always > been better.

During his time in √âtretat, Monet completed three paintings of fishing boats,Includes Fishing Boats, Calm Weather (Bateaux de P√™che, temps calme) (W 123) and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126). See also Rouart 1958. one of a rural road,Lane in Normandy (W 128). and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133). See also footnote 14 as cited in Herbert 1996, p. 138. Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes,: \\"Over the course of 30 winters, he [Monet] executed some 140 snowy views\\"; Moffett et al. 1999, p. 55: \\"...Monet painted the largest number of winter scenes (more than 140) and is the best known impressionist painter of effets de neige. As Monet took advantage of most significant snowfalls, his output of winter landscapes was often more sporadic, with occasional bursts of activity followed by periods without production...\\" the largest in its class.Myers 1998: \\"...his largest winter painting...\\"; : \\"It is Monet's largest and most ambitious snowscape, an essay about light and shadow on snow.\\" The exact location of the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown. Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Sim√©on above the Seine estuary in Honfleur. Rejection by the Salon Monet submitted The Magpie and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126) to the Salon of 1869. Both paintings were rejected in April. Critic Paul Richard said that the jurors rejected the painting as \\"too common and too coarse\\". Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury.Mus√©e d'Orsay, Claude Monet The Magpie, 2006. Monet told French novelist Ars√®ne Houssaye (1815-1896), \\"This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and in spite of my low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me.\\" A century later, The Magpie was acquired by the Mus√©e d'Orsay in 1984. It became one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.: \\"Visitor surveys and sales of postcard and reproductions indicate that it is the most popular single image in the museum\\"; Also see Critical analysis In the painting, a black magpie is perched on a gate in a wattle fence as sunlight falls on fresh white snow, creating shadows. With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus.Katherine Rothkopf in ; : \\"In the absence of any human figure, the central feature of the painting is the black bird perched on the gate, which is filled with an almost magical significance\\". Michael Howard of Manchester Metropolitan University called the painting \\"an extraordinary evocation of the snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the long shadows creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites of the sky and landscape\\".Howard 1989, Monet, p. 33 as quoted in . Curator Lynn Orr, then of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, noted Monet's interest in the changing light that depended on the hour and the vagaries of the atmosphere:: \\"...qualities of light characteristic of different times of day and in different atmospheric conditions.\\" > Unusual weather phenomena, such as snow and mist, fascinated Monet because > they altered the chromatic appearance of familiar topography. In such > paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves > under the combination of a greatly restricted color range, aerial > perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the > painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the > reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat > color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from > the spatial realities of the objects portrayed. The Magpie is an early example of Monet's investigation of colored shadows. In this piece, Monet makes use of the complementary colors of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on the snow gives the impression of a blue-violet color, the effect of simultaneous contrast. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and desaturating the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet.; ; In his study of Impressionism, art historian John Rewald observed that artists used snowscapes to \\"investigate the problem of shadows\\". The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in Gardner's Art Through the Ages: > After scrutinizing the effects of light and color on forms, the > Impressionists concluded that local color‚Äîan object's true color in white > light‚Äî becomes modified by the quality of the light shining on it, by > reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors > produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters > thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other > conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was > able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light. Monet's use of colored shadows arose from color theories that were popular in the 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) published one of the first modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (1643-1727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul (1786-1889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work.Georges Roque (1996) questions whether the Impressionists were aware of Chevreul's law of simultaneous contrast. Aside from Pissarro and Seurat, Roque can find no evidence that the Impressionists knew Chevreul's work directly. However, Backhaus et al. (1998) point out that it was possible the early Impressionists were familiar with the work of Eug√®ne Delacroix, who was intimate with Chevreul's color theories. It is generally accepted that as early as the 1860s, Monet was familiar with Delacroix's work and was influenced by his use of color. Georges Seurat (1859-1891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (1831-1902).. For more information about Ogden Rood and the Impressionists, see: Kemp, Martin (2008). \\"The Impressionists' Bible\\". Nature 453.7191. p. 37. Related work Monet's series of 11 paintings depicting The Bridge at Argenteuil (1874) also explored the use of colored shadows in its portrayal of the blue and purple shadow on the top portion of the bridge. Over the years, Monet became more and more obsessed with color and light. When his wife was dying in September 1879, Monet painted her in Camille Monet on Her Deathbed (1879), noting the \\"blue, yellow, grey tones\\". Monet told his friend, French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929), that he spent the time \\"focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face.\\" Camille died from cancer at the age of 32. After her death, Monet largely ceased painting people, focusing instead on natural landscapes. Monet later returned to painting snow and colored shadows with Grainstacks Snow Effect (1891).

They sprawl or climb by means of twining leaf stalks. One of the four species, Maurandya barclayana, is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant. The generic name is often misspelt as Maurandia. Two of its species have at times been placed in the genera Epixiphium and Maurandella. Description The species of Maurandya are either herbaceous perennials with fibrous roots or, in the case of M. wislizeni, an annual with a tap root. All are sprawlers or climbers, climbing by means of twining leaf stalks (petioles). The leaves are shaped like broad or narrow arrowheads, more rarely heart-shaped. The flower stalks (peduncles) grow upwards and bear solitary flowers. The more-or-less triangular sepals are not joined together but jointly form an urn-shaped structure around the base of the flower. The petals (collectively the corolla) are joined at the base to form a tube with five free lobes at the tip. The lobes are differentiated into two upper ones, usually curving backwards, and three lower ones, usually pointing forwards. The corolla is whitish at the base with various colours further on: pink, red, violet, blue or combinations of these. In M. antirrhiniflora, the flowers have two \\"lips\\" partly enclosing the throat or tube of the flower; in the other species, the flower tube is open. There are four fertile stamens, two of one length and two of another, plus a rudimentary sterile stamen. The stamens and style are included in the flower. After fertilization, a two-valved capsule forms, of various shapes, containing dark brown seeds. Taxonomy Maurandya scandens from The Botanist's Repository, 1797 Maurandya scandens was the first species of the genus to be described for science, by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in 1793, based on plants being grown in Spain. He named the species Usteria scandens. However, the generic name Usteria had already been used in 1790, so was illegitimate. In 1797, Casimiro G√≥mez Ortega provided the legitimate generic name, Maurandya. A year later, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin published the orthographic variant (i.e. misspelling) Maurandia. The generic name Maurandya honours Catherina Pancratia Maurandy, the wife of a Spanish professor of botany, described by Ortega as the partner (socia) of his botanical labours. The genus is placed in the tribe Antirrhineae; within this tribe, it is closely related to Lophospermum, Mabrya and Rhodochiton. Both Lophospermum and Rhodochiton have been included in Maurandya as sections; Mabrya was split off from Maurandya by Wayne J. Elisens. Scientific names within these genera have been confused; for example, an image accepted by Tropicos as Lophospermum erubescens bears the caption Maurandya barclaiana (a variant spelling of Maurandya barclayana). =Phylogeny= A number of molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that subtribe Maurandyinae, defined by Elisen to consist of the five North American genera Holmgrenanthe, Lophospermum, Mabrya, Maurandya and Rhodochiton, forms a monophyletic group, which is related to the Old World genera Cymbalaria and Asarina. Gehebrehiwet et al. suggested that the Maurandyinae could be expanded to include Cymbalaria and Asarina. Vargas et al. presented the following cladogram in 2013: Vargas et al. concluded that the Antirrhineae evolved in the Old World and subsequently colonized North America more than once, probably in the Miocene epoch (). One such colonization led to the evolution of the Maurandyinae (in Elisen's sense). =Species= Maurandya antirrhiniflora, in cultivation Maurandya wislizeni in its natural habitat Maurandya wislizeni , four species are accepted: * Maurandya antirrhiniflora Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd. (syn. Maurandella antirrhiniflora (Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.) Rothm.) * Maurandya barclayana Lindl. * Maurandya scandens (Cav.) Pers. * Maurandya wislizeni Engelm. ex A.Gray (syn. Epixiphium wislizeni (Engelm. ex A.Gray) Munz) The partially closed flowers of M. antirrhiniflora compared to the open flowers of the other species have been a factor in some authorities putting it into a separate genus, Maurandella (or at least into a different section within Maurandya). Elisens does not consider the differences sufficient to warrant such a move. M. wislizeni is somewhat different from the other species; for example, it is the only annual growing from a tap root. Some authorities have put it into a separate genus, Epixiphium, or in a separate section within Maurandya. This has been rejected by Elisens in his monograph on the subtribe to which Maurandya belongs, on the grounds that the overall similarities \\"indicate a close relationship among the four species\\". He does however place this species in a separate subgenus, M. subgenus Epixiphium, with the other three species in M. subgenus Maurandya. =Formerly placed here= A number of species formerly in Maurandya were put into a new genus, Mabrya, by Elisens and by David A. Sutton: * Maurandya acerifolia Pennell = Mabrya acerifolia (Pennell) Elisens * Maurandya coccinea I.M.Johnst. = Mabrya coccinea (I.M.Johnst.) Elisens * Maurandya erecta Hemsl. = Mabrya erecta (Hemsl.) Elisens * Maurandya flaviflora I.M.Johnst. = Mabrya flaviflora (I.M.Johnst.) D.A.Sutton * Maurandya geniculata B.L.Rob. & Fernald = Mabrya geniculata (B.L.Rob. & Fernald) Elisens * Maurandya rosei Munz = Mabrya rosei (Munz) Elisens Other species that have been placed in Maurandya include: * Maurandya atrosanguinea (Zucc.) G.Nicholson = Rhodochiton atrosanguineus (Zucc.) Rothm. * Maurandya erubescens (D.Don) A.Gray = Lophospermum erubescens D.Don * Maurandya juncea Benth. = Gambelia juncea (Benth.) D.A.Sutton * Maurandya lophospermum L.H.Bailey (syn. M. scandens (D.Don) A.Gray, nom. superfl., not M. scandens (Cav.) Pers.) = Lophospermum scandens D.Don * Maurandya petrophila Coville & C.V.Morton = Holmgrenanthe petrophila (Coville & C.V.Morton) Elisens * Maurandya purpusii Brandegee = Lophospermum purpusii (Brandegee) Rothm. Distribution and habitat Distribution of Maurandya species Maurandya species are native to Mexico and the south west United States (from California through Arizona and New Mexico to central Texas). The most widespread, M. antirrhiniflora, occurs in a wide range of habitats, from sandy coastal soils to calcareous rocky areas and from sea level to . The other three species are somewhat more restricted in habitat. M. wislizeni is an annual found in the Chihuahuan Desert. M. barclayana and M. scandens generally grow in mountainous regions of Mexico, from . Some species of Maurandya have escaped cultivation and become naturalized, including M. antirrhiniflora in Hawaii and Florida. Ecology Maurandya antirrhiniflora and M. barclayana are known to be pollinated by long-tongued bees, defined as those with tongues more than long. Species pollinated in this way typically have white, blue or violet flowers with floral tubes around long. The pollinator of M. wislizeni is unknown, but its flower colour and shape are similar, suggesting it too is pollinated by long-tongued bees. M. scandens has flowers of a similar size and shape, but of a reddish-pink colour, normally associated with pollination by hummingbirds. It may have recently evolved from a bee-pollinated ancestor. Cultivation thumbupright=1.5Comparison of Maurandya barclayana with Lophospermum scandens: ‚Äì Maurandya flower (1) is shorter with narrower sepals than Lophospermum flower (3) ‚Äì Maurandya leaf (2) is smooth with entire (untoothed) margins; Lophospermum leaf (4) is somewhat hairy with toothed margins. Maurandya barclayana has been cultivated as an ornamental climber since at least the 19th century. Joseph Paxton described its cultivation in 1836, saying that it was a \\"beautiful climber\\". Elisens described it as \\"a particularly attractive hanging or climbing plant\\". Maurandya scandens is also commonly cultivated and has escaped to grow in the wild. The two species can cross when grown together. As noted above, Maurandya and Lophospermum species have regularly been confused, particularly in cultivation. Cultivated species of Maurandya have shorter flowers than those of Lophospermum and leaves with entire rather than toothed margins. Plants may be grown from seed and treated as annuals. In frost-free climates, or where the roots can be protected from frost, plants may be perennial, regrowing from the base after dying back in the winter. M. barclayana is said to be hardy to .

Akifusa was the son of Nishida Kiyosada, a retainer of Tokugawa Tsunashige, the daimy≈ç of Kofu Domain. He was initially apprenticed to a sarugaku theatre troupe, but in 1684 became a page to Tokugawa Tsunatoyo. His family name was changed to \\"Manabe\\" around this time. He rose rapidly through the ranks due to his special relationship with Tsunashige, and by 1704 was counted as a member of his inner entourage, and had been awarded with the courtesy title of Echizen-no-kami, and court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. In 1705 his income was increased to 3,000 koku, but in 1706 he was named a deputy wakadoshiyori and granted additional estates in Sagami Province which brought his income to over the 10,000 koku mark required to become a daimy≈ç. The same year, his court rank was increased to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and he was nominated deputy r≈çj≈´. In 1710, his income was increased to 50,000 koku and he became daimy≈ç of Takasaki Domain. This rise in status of a person who was originally a member of the despised profession of \\"entertainer\\" to a daimy≈ç and senior official in the government was unprecedented and was largely due to the backing of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienobu and his successor Tokugawa Ietsugu. Akifusa was noted for his backing of the Confucianist, scholar- bureaucrat Arai Hakuseki as a \\"brain\\" for the Tokugawa shogunate and his economic and political reform program. Especially under the tenure of the young Tokugawa Ietsugu, Akifuse wielded tremendous influence as a sobay≈çnin. After Ietsugu died and was replaced by Tokugawa Yoshimune, Akifusa's influence went into rapid decline. He was relieved of all offices within the shogunate, and was transferred from Takasaki to the more remote Murakami Domain on the Sea of Japan in 1717. He died at Murakami in 1720 at the age of 54. As he had no male heir, he adopted his younger brother, Manabe Akitoki as heir. His grave is at the temple of J≈çnen-ji in Murakami. Shortly after Akifusa's death, Manabe Akitoki was transferred to the newly-created Sabae Domain, where his descendants lived to the Meiji restoration. References *Papinot, Edmond. (1948).

Notable features include the monastery of \\"Our Lady of Ras Baalbek\\" (Deir Saidat ar-Ras) and two Byzantine churches. One church is in the centre of the village and the other lies by the Roman aqueduct. In 1838, Eli Smith noted Ras Baalbek's population as being predominantly Catholic Christian.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 144 In 2014, the war with ISIS in the nearby village of Arsal resulted in the residents of Ras Baalbek forming a militia to protect the village. The militias were allied to the Lebanese Armed Forces. In September 2016 the Lebanese Army attacked Islamic State positions near Ras Baalbek. Demographics Around 15,000 people live in Ras Baalbek.

He added 67 strings to the traditional 13 string koto design, creating an instrument much like a western harp. Together, the 80 strings provide a far larger pitch range than the standard Koto. It is widely seen as a short-lived experimental instrument. Construction The 80-string koto was largely hand-constructed as only limited machinery existed to manufacture it. It was built along similar lines to the common Koto, but with reinforced design elements. The platform where strings are tied runs the entire length and breadth of the instrument to accommodate the increased strain. As with other kotos, The kiri wood (Paulownia tomentosa) is molded and treated. Modern bridges are often made of plastic and they can be found in both small and large sizes. These bridges are rearranged as needed during playing. Strings are traditionally made from Silk threads, although plastic nylon strings are often used as a cheaper alternative.

The 2011 survey recorded 2,676 Ugandans in Australia. History There was very little migration from Uganda before 1960. In the 1960s there was a gradual growth of Ugandans that immigrated to Australia largely for political reasons, and for many it was for further studies, predominantly graduate school. Immigration records from 1985 cite Ugandans separately from other Africans and show the arrival of 859 immigrants, most fleeing Idi Amin's terror. Of note is the fact that Afro Asian, a group encompassing all brown-skinned people, usually Indians, Pakistani, and Konkani of Goa, are counted in a separate category from Ugandans, although many of them came from Uganda. In 1976, 359 Ugandans arrived, and 241 came in 1977. Immigration fell to less than 150 each year in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a time of political stability in Uganda. Demography Most Ugandans who emigrate go to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The reason for migration is based on the low economic remuneration for workers in Uganda and the low political stability of the country compared with the west. Also, many Ugandans immigrate for better educational opportunities. Most people migrating come from cities, so that rural emigration is low. Ugandans who want to work in rural areas or in public practice do not usually migrate. Australia is perceived to have better pay and less competition to enter the country. Most students who migrate learned about opportunities for the emigration of their friends and colleagues who had already emigrated, because information on migration in Uganda isn't very accessible. Immigrants with professional employment are geographically scattered, though significant communities have developed in metropolitan areas. Some newly arrived Ugandans receive assistance from Catholic Social Services and other humanitarian relief agencies. Because English is Uganda's official language, many Ugandan Australians do not face significant language barriers. Refugees who lived in rural areas, however, find Australian culture is very different from what they left behind. Australian life poses challenges for those who have not seen escalators, refrigerators, traffic lights, and scan-your-own grocery checkouts. Australia has become home to many, and although numerous Ugandans come home upon accomplishing the goals that brought them to the Australia or North America, for many its home. This has prompted them to forge solidities, associations and clubs to foster unity, brotherhood and goals to bridge and maintain connectivity to their motherland. The solidarities are based on cultural/ethnic backgrounds, with UNAA, as the umbrella association that houses all Ugandans regardless their background, creed, tribe and/or social status. The month of August will see some three major events bring together Ugandans in Australia in rather spectacular flair. These festivities include the Ttabamiruka, the International Community of Banyakigezi. The West has traditionally viewed Ugandans as passive people. Their willing servitude and non-aggressive behavior results from centuries of tribal structure that discouraged individual self-promotion. The culture of the Baganda was authoritarian, and obedience to the king was crucial. Ugandans tend to establish single-family homes where children learn reverence for God and their family. The choice of a marriage partners is up to the individual. Ugandan immigrants take part in community and school events in much the same way as other Australians. The children of Ugandan Australians assimilate into Australian culture. Most Ugandan Australians are Christians, as about two- thirds of Uganda's population is Christian. The remaining third practices indigenous religions or follows Islam.

After harvest, they automatically grow back. By eliminating replanting, perennial cropping can reduce topsoil losses due to erosion, increase biological carbon sequestration due to reduced soil- disturbing tillage, and greatly reduce waterway pollution through agricultural runoff due to less nitrogen input. Mechanisms *Erosion control: Because plant materials (stems, crowns, etc.) can remain in place year-round, topsoil erosion due to wind and rainfall/irrigation is reduced *Water-use efficiency: Because these crops tend to be deeper and more fibrously-rooted than their annual counterparts, they are able to hold onto soil moisture more efficiently, while filtering pollutants (e.g. excess nitrogen) traveling to groundwater sources. *Nutrient cycling efficiency: Because perennials more efficiently take up nutrients as a result of their extensive root systems, reduced amounts of nutrients need to be supplemented, lowering production costs while reducing possible excess sources of fertilizer runoff. *Light interception efficiency: Earlier canopy development and longer green leaf duration increase the seasonal light interception efficiency of perennials, an important factor in plant productivity. *Carbon sequestration: Because perennial grasses use a greater fraction of carbon to produce root systems, more carbon is integrated into soil organic matter, contributing to increases in soil organic carbon stocks. Example crops *Miscanthus giganteus - a perennial crop with high yields and high GHG mitigation potential. *Perennial sunflower - a perennial oil and seedcrop developed through backcrossing genes with wild sunflower. *Perennial grain - more extensive root systems allow for more efficient water and nutrient uptake, while reducing erosion due to rain and wind year-round. *Perennial rice - currently in the development stage using similar methods to those used in producing the perennialized sunflower, perennial rice promises to reduce deforestation through increases in production efficiency by keeping cleared land out of the fallow stage for long periods of time.

Jing served in prominent roles in Emperor Taizu's administration and later administrations of his sons Zhu Yougui and Zhu Zhen, although neither listened much to Jing. After Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin‚Äîthe chief rival state to Later Liang‚Äîlaunched a surprise attack on the Later Liang capital Daliang in 923, Zhu Zhen, facing defeat and capture, committed suicide, ending Later Liang. Jing, hearing of the state's destruction, also committed suicide.  Background  It is not known when Jing Xiang was born. His family was from Fengyi (È¶ÆÁøä, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) and was descended from the middle-Tang Dynasty chancellor Jing Hui. His great-grandfather Jing Wan () and father Jing Gun () both served as prefectural prefects, while his grandfather Jing Xin () served as a prefectural governmental administrator. It was said that Jing Xiang, in his youth, was studious, and was particularly skillful at using knife-pens (i.e., knives that were used to carve text on bamboo). During the middle of Qianfu era (874-879) of Emperor Xizong, Jing submitted himself for imperial examinations but was not able to pass in the Jinshi class.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 18. After the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured the Tang imperial capital Chang'an around the new year 881,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Jing left the Guanzhong region (i.e., the region around Chang'an), eventually going to Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), where, after Huang was expelled from the Chang'an region by Tang forces, his former subordinate Zhu Quanzhong, who had turned against him and became a Tang general, had been made the military governor (Jiedushi). Zhu's assistant in his role as governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi), Wang Fa (), was from the same locale as Jing, and Jing initially went to follow Wang. Wang treated him well, but had no opportunity to recommend him to Zhu. Jing, unable to distinguish himself, resorted to writing snippets of witty words and passing them around in Zhu's army. This impressed Zhu, who was not well- learned and did not like to read but who liked witty words. He thus summoned Jing to his presence and initially offered him an officer position. However, Jing did not want to be an army officer and requested a civilian position, and therefore was initially made the overseer of the communication station at Xuanwu, to be in charge of communiques with the imperial government and other circuits. During Zhu's subsequent campaigns against the rebel general Qin Zongquan, who declared himself emperor at Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), Jing participated in the strategy sessions. Zhu was impressed by Jing's strategies, and after Qin's destruction became particularly trusting of Jing.  As Zhu Quanzhong's chief strategist during Tang Dynasty  It was said that, because Zhu Quanzhong's thoughts and actions were unpredictable, other staff members often found it difficult to give him advice. Jing Xiang, however, was often able to anticipate what he was thinking and complement the parts that his own plans were lacking, further causing him to entrust Jing with greater responsibility.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. For example, in 889, when two of Zhu's generals, Zhu Zhen (Êú±Áèç, not the same person as the later emperor) and Li Tangbin () had a dispute while both were attacking Zhu Quanzhong's rival Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and Zhu Zhen killed Li in anger, Jing, after receiving the news, did not immediately inform Zhu Quanzhong (because he did not want Zhu Quanzhong to make a rash reaction). Rather, he waited to the night to inform Zhu Quanzhong and then suggested to Zhu Quanzhong that he should arrest Li's wife and children to first comfort Zhu Zhen, before carrying out any actions against Zhu Zhen. Zhu Quanzhong accepted this decision, and Zhu Zhen did not rebel at the time; it was only later, when Zhu Quanzhong visited the army personally that he ordered Zhu Zhen arrested and executed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. By 893, Zhu Quanzhong's army was worn out after having put Shi under siege at Ganhua's capital Xu Prefecture () for years, and one of the staff members, Zhang Tao (), had suggested to Zhu in a letter that the failure to capture Xu was the result of the army having been launched on a day of ill fortune. Zhu initially believed Zhang's words, but Jing pointed out that if these words spread, the army morale would collapse, so Zhu burned Zhang's letter. Subsequently, Zhu's general Pang Shigu () was able to capture Xu, and Shi committed suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. At the time of Shi's death, Jing had just lost his wife. Meanwhile, one of Shi's beautiful concubines was a Lady Liu, who had previously been the wife of Shang Rang, a chancellor in Huang Chao's administration. Zhu initially took Lady Liu as a concubine himself, but later decided to award her to Jing as his new wife. However, after Lady Liu became Jing's wife, she continued to carry on close relationship, perhaps sexual, with Zhu; as a result, Jing initially distanced himself from her. She, in anger, pointed out to Jing that she had been the wife of a chancellor (i.e., Shang) and the concubine to an honored military governor, and that her relationship with Zhu was to ensure that he would continue to trust Jing deeply, and she offered to let him divorce her if he wanted to. Jing saw the wisdom and also did not want to offend Zhu, and therefore remained married to her. (Thereafter, during the time that Zhu was still a Tang warlord, Lady Liu was said to be just as influential on his policies as Jing was.) In 903, when Zhu had seized Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong back from Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), where Emperor Zhaozong had been forcibly taken by the eunuch Han Quanhui,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Zhu returned Emperor Zhaozong to Chang'an, and Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Jing and a number of Zhu's subordinates honors for their participation in Zhu's campaign;Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. he also personally welcomed Jing and another key staff member of Zhu's, Li Zhen, to the palace. However, later in 903, Zhu and Emperor Zhaozong's chancellor Cui Yin, who had previously been allies, broke over Zhu's suspicion that Cui had his nephew Zhu Youlun () assassinated, whom Zhu had left in charge of the imperial guards at Chang'an. In 904, Zhu Quanzhong killed Cui and forced Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Luoyang. At a subsequent feast that Emperor Zhaozong held at the Luoyang palace, he initially invited Zhu to attend, but Zhu suspected Emperor Zhaozong of laying a trap for him; he therefore claimed to be already drunk and refused to attend. When Emperor Zhaozong said, \\"If Quanzhong does not wish to attend, let Jing Xiang come,\\" Zhu hit Jing and stated, \\"Jing Xiang is also drunk!\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. In 905, Zhu conquered the domains of two brothers who were warlords opposing him‚ÄîZhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) and Zhao Kuangming the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). He then, without initially planning it, decided to head east to attack Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Jing advised him against it, pointing out that he had terrorized the other warlords already through his quick victory over the Zhaos, and that a failed campaign against Huainan would damage his reputation. Zhu, however, did not listen to Jing on this occasion, and regretted it after his attacks were repelled by Yang. However, it appeared that this was the exception, not the norm, for it was stated that Zhu's gradual consolidation of power was largely done with the advice of Jing.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266.  During Emperor Taizu's reign  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and establishing Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. He changed the name of Tang's office of palace communications (Ê®ûÂØÜÈô¢, Shumi Yuan) to Xuanzheng Yuan () and transformed it from a eunuch-led organization to one led by regular officials, and he made Jing its acting director. Meanwhile, at Jing's and Li Zhen's suggestion, Emperor Taizu ordered 15 senior Tang officials into retirement, believing Jing's assertion that they were betrayers of the Tang cause and could not be trusted. Historians generally credited Jing for the general efficiency of Emperor Taizu's administration, despite Emperor Taizu's impulsiveness and, as he aged, violent behavior. For example, the Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, commented, adopting a similar view from the History of the Five Dynasties: In 911, Emperor Taizu bestowed the honorific title of Guanglu Daifu () on Jing and made him the acting minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu) and a chief imperial scholar at Jinluan Hall (). (Jing was the first person to receive that latter title.) He also created Jing the Marquess of Pingyang. In 912, Emperor Taizu became seriously ill, and he summoned Jing to his presence to entrust a number of orders to him. One of those orders was to send Emperor Taizu's son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying out of the capital Luoyang to be the prefect of Lai Prefecture. Zhu Yougui, receiving the news, believed that Emperor Taizu's intent was to kill him, while passing the throne to his adoptive brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo. He therefore entered the palace and assassinated Emperor Taizu. He issued an edict in Emperor Taizu's name putting Zhu Youwen to death; he then took the throne himself.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268.  After Emperor Taizu's reign  Zhu Yougui, after taking the throne, believed that, since Jing Xiang was a close associate of his father's, leaving Jing in charge of the office of palace communications would be dangerous, but as Jing had a good reputation, he did not want to cause the people to be disappointed in seeing Jing demoted. Therefore, he gave Jing a technical promotion‚Äîto be a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ()‚Äîand also Zhongshu Shilang (), but removed him from the office of palace communications, replacing him with Li Zhen. Jing, realizing that Zhu Yougui did not trust him, often claimed to be ill and did not involve himself in policy decisions. In 913, Zhu Yougui's brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun carried out a counter- coup; when Zhu Yougui saw that he was nearing defeat, he committed suicide, and Zhu Youzhen became emperor. (Zhu Youzhen then changed his name to Zhu Zhen.) While Jing and Li Zhen continued to be the most honored officials in Zhu Zhen's administration, Zhu Zhen largely entrusted actual policy decisions to his brother-in-law Zhao Yan, two brothers of his deceased wife Consort Zhang Zhang Handing () and Zhang Hanjie (), and Consort Zhang's cousins Zhang Hanlun () and Zhang Hanrong (). It was said that Jing's and Li Zhen's suggestions were often ignored, and Li Zhen, as a result, often claimed illness. Thereafter, the Later Liang administration began to deteriorate.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 917, Zhu Zhen, who had moved the capital from Luoyang to Daliang, prepared for a grand ceremony to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth south of Luoyang at Zhao's suggestion, against Jing's advice that given Later Liang was locked in a war with its major rival Jin, the resources should be better conserved. When Zhu was at Luoyang, Jin's prince Li Cunxu took the opportunity to capture the border outpost Yangliu (Ê•äÂäâ, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), on the south bank of the Yellow River, which largely formed the boundary between Later Liang and Jin at that time (Later Liang to the south, Jin to the north), after Later Liang had lost large amounts of territory north of the Yellow River in the preceding years. News of Yangliu's fall reached Luoyang, along with rumors that Jin forces had already captured Daliang. Zhu, terrified, cancelled the ceremony and returned to Daliang. After Zhu returned to Daliang, Jin forces withdrew from the region after pillaging Yun (ÈÑÜÂ∑û, in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Pu (ÊøÆÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong) Prefectures. In light of this surprise attack, Jing submitted a petition to Zhu:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. However, Zhao and the Zhangs argued that Jing was simply full of frustration, and persuaded Zhu not to follow Jing's suggestion. In 921, Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao, a major ally of Jin, was assassinated by his adoptive son Zhang Wenli, who, anticipating that Li Cunxu would attack him, sought to submit to and seek aid from Later Liang. Jing pointed out that this was a golden opportunity to counterattack against Jin and recapture the territory lost, but Zhao and the Zhangs argued that Zhang Wenli was merely using Later Liang to accomplish his own goals and that Later Liang had no spare troops to aid Zhang Wenli. Zhu, listening to them, rejected Jing's suggestions. Zhang Wenli (and, subsequently, after his death, his son Zhang Chujin) therefore received no Later Liang aid and were subsequently defeated by Li Cunxu. Li Cunxu thus was able to absorb Zhao territory into Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In spring 923, Li Cunxu, who had declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as its Emperor Zhuangzong), sent his adoptive brother Li Siyuan to capture Yun Prefecture in a surprise attack‚Äîthus leaving no natural defenses between Yun Prefecture and Daliang. Jing, seeing that the empire was in danger, went to see Zhu and showed him a rope, stating that if the emperor would not accept his suggestion‚Äîmaking the general Wang Yanzhang the commander of the operations resisting Later Tang‚Äîhe would hang himself in the emperor's presence. Zhu agreed this time and made Wang the commander of the forces against Jin. Wang was subsequently able to recapture Desheng (Âæ∑Âãù, in modern Puyang, Henan), another important outpost on the Yellow River, from Later Tang and briefly cut off the communications between Li Siyuan and the main Later Tang territory, hoping to force Li Siyuan to flee. However, Zhao and the Zhangs, who supported the general Duan Ning instead, continuously defamed Wang, and Zhu thereafter replaced Wang with Duan, despite repeated objections from Jing and Li Zhen. Subsequently, Later Tang was able to retain Yun Prefecture, despite its precarious communication line. Once in command, Duan drew an ambitious plan to counterattack against Later Tang advances. Under Duan's plans, Duan and Du Yanqiu would lead the main forces and confront Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong; Huo Yanwei would take an army and head toward Later Tang's Anguo (ÂÆâÂúã, headquartered in modern Xingtai, Hebei) and Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei, i.e., formerly Zhao territory) Circuits; Dong Zhang would launch an attack from Kuangyi Circuit (Âå°Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi)‚Äîformerly Jin territory, but which had become Later Liang territory after Emperor Zhuangzong's cousin Li Jitao, who ruled it, defected to Later Liang earlier in the year‚Äîtoward Later Tang's main territory around Taiyuan; and Wang Yanzhang and Zhang Hanjie would head toward Yun Prefecture. In winter 923, before Duan was able to actually implement his four-pronged attack, however, Emperor Zhuangzong took his army south of the Yellow River to rendezvous with Li Siyuan; together, they defeated and captured Wang and Zhang Hanjie (whose army was the weakest of the four prongs), and then directly headed for Daliang, with Duan's main force trapped north of the Yellow River (having crossed it earlier in the year in preparation of launching the four-prong attack) and unable to come to Daliang's aid. Hearing of Wang's defeat, Zhu, desperate by this point, summoned Jing to the palace and apologized to him for not listening to him, asking him whether he had any strategies left for defending Daliang. Jing wept and responded: Both he and Zhu cried bitterly, but could think of nothing else to say. Subsequently, Zhu had his imperial guard officer Huangfu Lin () kill him, ending Later Liang. (Huangfu then killed himself.) Upon Emperor Zhuangzong's arrival at Daliang, he issued an edict generally pardoning the Later Liang officials. Hearing of the edict, Li Zhen went to see Jing and suggested that they go see Emperor Zhuangzong together to beg for pardon. Jing responded, \\"Both of us were Liang chancellors. We could not correct the emperor's poor governance, and we could not save the dynasty from destruction. If the new emperor questions us on these grounds, how are we going to respond?\\" The next morning, Jing's servants informed him that Li Zhen had already gone to the palace. Jing sighed and stated, \\"Li Zhen is no man. The Zhus and the new emperor have been enemies for generations. Now, the empire has been destroyed, and the emperor is dead. Even if the new emperor would spare us, how can we still enter the Jianguo Gate [(Âª∫ÂúãÈñÄ, the gate to the Later Liang imperial palace)]?\\" He therefore hanged himself. Within a few days, Emperor Zhuangzong issued another edict which, while generally confirming the pardon, ordered that Jing (whose death he apparently did not know), Li Zhen, Zhao, the Zhangs, the Later Liang general Zhu Gui (), and the Khitan prince Yel√º Sala'abo () (the brother of the Khitan emperor Emperor Taizu of Liao, who had previously rebelled against the Khitan emperor and fled to Emperor Zhuangzong, and then re-defected to Later Liang) be put to death, along with their families. Jing's family was therefore slaughtered.

He is regarded as the ancestor of the Orontid dynasty. Biography=Satrap of Armenia= Orontes was a son of the Bactrian Artasyrus. Orontes has therefore sometimes been referred to as \\"Orontes the Bactrian\\", According to the Greek sources (Xenophon, Strabo), Orontes was made Satrap of Sophene and Matiene (Mitanni).Petrie, Flinders. Mitannian (Armenian) origin He was called \\"Praefectus Armeniae\\" by Trogus. Battle of Cunaxa (401 BC) Orontes was given these Satrapies of Armenis in 401 BC for supporting the Persian king Artaxerxes II in the Battle of Cunaxa against Cyrus the Younger. After the Battle of Cunaxa, Orontes harassed the Ten Thousand as they attempted to return home and made their way through Armenia.Xen. Anab. 2.4-5 passim It is likely he ruled from Armavir as the previous Satrap of Armenia, Hydarnes, had ruled from there. He married Rhodogoune, the daughter of king Artaxerxes II by one of his concubines. Cyprus campaign (381 BC) He next appears in 381 BC as the army commander during the campaign to recapture Cyprus from its rebel leader, King Evagoras, whilst the navy was under the command of Tiribazus. They managed to lay siege to the city of Salamis; however, Orontes intrigued against Tiribazus before king Artaxerxes II, but this led to Orontes falling from favor. It may be because of this that he was stripped of his satrapy and sent to the west of the Empire to become satrap of Mysia.. =Satrap of Mysia= Orontes coin with running Achaemenid king. Legend OŒ°ONTA (Orontes). Minted in Caria. In 362 BC a great rebellion occurred in Anatolia, led by Datames, Satrap of Cappadocia (Revolt of the Satraps). Some sources say that it was Orontes who was chosen by the rebels as their leader. However, Orontes stayed loyal to king Artaxerxes II and aided in the collapse of the rebellion. Apparently, he wanted to rule Anatolia and Armenia alone. He captured the city of Pergamon and sent bribes to Athens, where a decree seeking an alliance records his name. He was able to fund these activities as he is recorded as having a personal fortune of 3,000 talents of silver. From around 362-361, Orontes is said to be \\"Satrap of Mysia\\", and there is various proof of his activity in the region and around Pergamon. In 355 BC he rebelled against the new king of the Achaemenid Empire, Artaxerxes III. He still had possession of parts of western Anatolia. He fought a battle against the satrap of Daskyleion and minted his own coins in Ionia, such as the one displayed in the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris. He handed back Pergamon to the king. The kings of the Kingdom of Commagene claimed descent from Orontes I and also claimed Darius I of Persia as an ancestor, thanks to Orontes' marriage to Rhodogoune, daughter of Artaxerxes II who was a direct descendant of king Darius I.The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times - 2 Vols., Richard G. Hovannisian, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1997 Xenophon's Anabasis mentions that the region near the river Centrites was defended by the Satrap of Armenia for Artaxerxes II and named Orontes son of Artasyrus who had Armenian contingents. Xenophon mentioned that he had a son called Tigranes. His successor was Darius III and after Codomannus these Satrapies were ruled by Orontes II. Whether he was the same person as Tigranes but had adopted the name Orontes or that they were brothers is not known. Coinage All the known coinage of Orontes is confined to the region of Mysia, and was only found in cities from Lampsacus to Colophon, particularly Adramyteion and Kisthene in the area of Aeolis on the coast.

Tarhouni served as the minister for oil and finance on the National Transitional Council, the provisional governing authority in Libya, from 23 March to 22 November 2011. He acted in the capacity of interim prime minister of Libya during the departure of outgoing incumbent Mahmoud Jibril from 23 October 2011 until Abdurrahim El-Keib was formally named to succeed Jibril on 31 October. Early life and education Born in Libya, Tarhouni studied economics at the University of Libya, until fleeing the country in 1973. He was stripped of citizenship, sentenced to death in absentia, and put on a government hit list in 1981. After immigrating to the United States, Tarhouni continued his studies, earning a master's degree (1978) and a PhD (1983) from Michigan State University. From 1985 up until the outbreak of the Libyan revolution, he had been a popular senior lecturer in business economics at the University of Washington Michael G. Foster School of Business where he won numerous teaching awards. Political career Tarhouni was named to head both the oil and finance ministries of the National Transitional Council, an opposition council formed to coordinate anti-Gaddafi elements during the Libyan Civil War in March 2011. He acted as a frequent spokesman for the council and wielded considerable influence as a prominent liberal in the opposition. He officially announced the transfer of the NTC from Benghazi to Tripoli on 25 August 2011. On 3 September 2011, Tarhouni, acting as deputy chairman of the NTC's executive board, announced he was also chairman of a Supreme Security Committee, responsible for all security matters in Tripoli. Tarhouni was named as deputy prime minister on 2 October 2011 after acting in the position for several months. He succeeded Mahmoud Jibril as acting prime minister following Libya's declaration of liberation just 21 days later. On 31 October 2011, Tarhouni's term as acting prime minister ended with the election of Abdurrahim El-Keib in a vote taken by the 51 members of the NTC. In 2012, Tarhouni founded the National Centrist Party, becoming its first leader. He said that his party would collaborate with Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces Alliance. He was elected as the head of the constituent assembly on 22 April 2014. After politics Tarhouni said at a press conference in late November 2011 that he was offered a position in Keib's government, but he declined, claiming the new cabinet was \\"supported from the outside by money, arms and PR\\" in an apparent reference to the role of Qatar in backing the NTC. He criticised Keib's selection of government ministers as \\"the elite\\" and said the government was not sufficiently representative of the country. In December 2011, Tarhouni returned to Seattle for a week. He gave a brief speech at the University of Washington on 20 December in which he reflected on his role in the Libyan revolution and talked about his hopes for a democratic transition, including his aim of forming a new political party. Tarhouni also walked back his earlier criticism of the interim government, expressing confidence in its good intentions.

In 1933, she founded and conducted the Orchestrette Classique in New York. It consisted of women musicians and premiered works by then relatively untried American composers, such as Paul Creston, Samuel Barber and David Diamond, that are now widely played and celebrated. She also edited and published the ground- breaking newsletter, Women in Music, which highlighted the activities of professional women musicians throughout the ages. In addition, she founded several concert series in Manhattan, including the West Side Orchestral Concerts, the Student Symphony Society of New York, and the Carl Schurz Park concerts. A pioneer and advocate In 1933, when Fr√©d√©rique Petrides first presented her Orchestrette Classique, it was almost unheard of for a woman to be an orchestral conductor. And even at the close of her career, in 1977, not much had changed in that regard. Petrides was a pioneer, as one of the first woman conductors and \\"one-woman crusader\\" for the rights and advancement of women musicians in general, through her performances, articles and the dissemination, in the United States and internationally, of the Women in Music newsletters.LePage 1983 p. 203-204Groh 1991  Beginnings and influences =In Belgium= Fr√©d√©rique Petrides was born Fr√©d√©rique Jeanne Elisabeth Petronella Mayer, into a luxurious life in Antwerp, Belgium on September 26, 1903, which she later shared with two younger brothers, Jan and Gottfried. She was daughter to Joseph Heinrich Friedrich Mayer, a prominent industrialist and art collector, and S√©raphine Sebrechts Mayer, a well-known pianist, composer and teacher at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, who was also an accomplished painter and photographer. Growing up, Fr√©d√©rique (\\"Riki\\" to family and friends) and her siblings, had, according to her brother Jan's 1957 memoir, a very formal father, in manner and dress, old enough to be their \\"grandfather\\" and two \\"simultaneous mothers\\" : S√©raphine, who attended to their artistic development, and her closest friend since childhood, Jeanne Fran√ßoise Schenck, whom they called Godel (Bavarian German for godmother). Godel lived with them and, assisted by their governess, Fraulein Klara, attended to the day-to-day matters. She was also responsible for their schooling, with the result that all three were given high scholastic marks when they eventually entered the German school on Antwerp's rue Gr√©try, considered one of the best private schools in the city. Jan Mayer wrote this about their father, mother and Godel, \\"...few people have been so fortunate in the choice of their early associates.\\" And many days were spent at The Kitchburg (German for Kitsch Castle), the family's country home in Capellenbosch, a suburb of Antwerp. There the children explored the grounds, played with the domesticated and wild animals, invented elaborate games of the imagination; and scouted for swarms of bees to add to their mother's bee hives. Another aspect of Riki's upbringing, was the family's isolation. Her father had been born German, and his powerful and aristocratic family (his maternal grandparents were von Wittgensteins and his grandmother had been born a Schaafhausen) disapproved of his marriage to the Belgian musician, S√©raphine Sebrechts, and except for his brother, August, ended all communications with him. Also later, with the advent of World War I, most of the Mayers' Belgian friends were no longer willing to be on good terms with an expatriate German, and turned their backs on him and his family. All the while, Riki pursued her musical training. She studied violin as one of three private students accepted by Mathieu Crickboom, who played second violin in the famed Ysaye String Quartet; and she was taught theory and composition by her mother; Sebrechts had been \\"preparing to compete for the Belgium Prix de Rome in composition until dissuaded by her conventional parents. It was the waste of her mother's fine talent, Petrides believes, which motivated her to work for the advancement of women musicians, as she did in the 1930s and 40s\\". =In New York= In 1923, Riki emigrated to the United States where she enrolled in a conducting class at New York University, because an orchestra was available to her there on which she could practice. She also gave violin recitals, violin lessons, and coached string players. Years later, from 1950‚Äì1956, at the invitation of a conductor whom she greatly admired, Dimitri Mitropoulos, she would attend his New York Philharmonic rehearsals, and confer with him, which strengthened her development as a conductor. The Orchestrette In 1931, she married journalist, Peter Petrides, who wholeheartedly supported her career, and encouraged her to found the Orchestrette Classique, in 1933, of which he became manager and publicist. The Orchestrette, an all-women chamber orchestra, gave five to six concerts annually in Carnegie Chamber Music Hall, now Weill Recital Hall. In 1942, the Orchestrette Classique was renamed the Orchestrette of New York. Under Madame Petrides's direction, the programming was notable in combining performances of little-known works by the classical masters with premieres of pieces by then relatively unknown American composers like Samuel Barber and Paul Creston, and the British Ralph Vaughan Williams, that have since entered the musical canon. From 1935 to 1940, with the help of her husband, Fr√©d√©rique Petrides edited and published the Orchestrette's Women in Music newsletters; a unique series, it followed the activities of women musicians from ancient times to the then present. =Women musicians in demand= The Orchestrette of New York was made up of extraordinary women instrumentalists, and, because the Second World War's draft caused vacancies, they were suddenly offered positions in the major symphony orchestras. Petrides, not wanting to discourage her players' advancement, chose to let the Orchestrette come to an end, and its final performance was given in 1943. Activities right From then on, until the end of her career in 1977, Fr√©d√©rique Petrides conducted mixed orchestras and continued to unearth not widely known compositions by classical composers, and to introduce works by American composers. In the 1930s, she had founded the Hudson Valley Symphony Orchestra in Tarrytown, New York, which she headed for seven years. Then, in 1956 and 1957, she conducted concerts in Washington Square Park; and in 1958, she founded the Carl Schurz Park concert series on Manhattan's Upper East Side, at which, for five years, she led her Festival Symphony Orchestra, composed primarily of members of the New York Philharmonic. In 1962, she founded the West Side Community Concerts (renamed West Side Orchestral Concerts in 1968) in Riverside Park, where she continued to lead her Festival Symphony Orchestra until 1977. She also established the Student Symphony Society of New York City, which she conducted for eleven seasons, beginning in 1950, whose members, age nine to nineteen, were selected for their talent. Reviewers Petrides's accomplishments were reviewed by leading critics and writers such as Virgil Thomson, H. Howard Taubman, Irving Kolodin, Olin Downes, Robert A. Simon, Jerome D. Bohm, Francis D. Perkins, Theodore Strongin, Raymond Ericson, Harold C. Schonberg and Robert Sherman who, in the New York Times of July 3, 1970, describes Petrides as \\"a prime mover in New York's cultural affairs since the mid-thirties\\".

Its primary software focus is calculator programming for TI and Casio graphing calculators, and its primary hardware focus is on mobile and wearable computing hardware. Among its most notable projects are the Doors CS shell for the TI-83+ series of graphing calculators, the Clove 2 dataglove, the Ultimate Calculator, and the CALCnet / globalCALCnet system for networking graphing calculators and connecting them to the Internet. The Cemetech website hosts tools for calculator programmers, including the SourceCoder TI-BASIC IDE and the jsTIfied TI-83+/84+ emulator. The founder of the site, Dr. Christopher Mitchell (\\"Kerm Martian\\"), began the site to showcase his personal projects, but since its early days, it has branched out to become one of the several major sites of the TI calculator hobbyist community and a source for hardware and programming development assistance. It has incubated many software and hardware projects beginning in the calculator community at its roots but including microprocessor development, general electrical engineering, desktop applications, and mobile/web applications.  History  Cemetech began as a personal website hosted on Homestead and later GeoCities, publishing personal software and hardware projects. In 2004 the site expanded on shared hosting with a PhpBB- based forum, and in March 2005 moved to Cemetech.net. The site spent the following three years consolidating its presence in the TI graphing calculator enthusiast community, attracting programmers who began publishing their own independent software projects on the site. Early projects were primarily calculator-related, later branching out into computer, web, and embedded programming. In mid-2006, Cemetech lost several hundred posts when hosting provider Jatol disappeared overnight, stranding hundreds of customers without websites or backups. From 2008, Cemetech expanded further into hardware development, releasing popular projects such as the Clove 2 typing glove, an electro-acoustic musical instrument, and several hardware mods of graphing calculators. Major software projects have included networking libraries for calculators and other low-resource devices, as well as the hardware and computer software to support internet-connected calculators, an extensive shell called Doors CS for these devices, and work on distributed computing and image processing projects by the founder and several staff members. In 2012, Cemetech's founder published a book called \\"Programming the TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus\\" which was published by Manning Publications, an introductory programming book inspired by his experiences working with beginner programmers at Cemetech.  Projects  The following Cemetech projects have been widely disseminated on technology news sites and blogs, organized alphabetically. * Clove 2: A Bluetooth data glove for one-handed typing. * Doors CS: A calculator shell for the TI-83+/TI-84+ series of graphing calculators, offering a GUI API, a networking stack, and features for users and developers. * Floppy Drive Music on a TI-83+: A twist on the classic project of using the stepper motors and coils in old hardware such as hard drives or floppy drives to make sound or music. This version uses a calculator as the controller, utilizing its two I/O lines to control the floppy drive. * gCn (globalCALCnet) and CALCnet: A linking protocol for linking the TI-83+ series of graphing calculators over the internet, or to each other. Some applications include a chat client that can link calculators to each other and to IRC as well as a scorched-earth genre multiplayer game called Obliterate. Another famous usage of gCn is the Gossamer web browser, a version of the Lynx web browser. * Gossamer: A web browser for graphing calculators, operating over the CALCnet and globalCALCnet networking protocols, allowing viewing of and interaction with simplified web pages. A remote bridge based around the Lynx text-only web browser reformats web pages for use on the calculators. *jsTIfied: An online emulator for TI-73, TI-76.fr, TI-81, TI-82, TI-82 Stats.fr, TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+SE, TI-84+ and TI-84+SE. * Multichord: An electro-acoustic musical instrument using a hard drive to tension a string that can be strummed or plucked. * SourceCoder: An online IDE for the TI-BASIC programming language, as well as the Z80 and eZ80 Assembly languages. It also has support for user- developed languages like C and ICE (developed primarily by Cemetech users MateoConLechuga and PT_/P_T respectively) * Ultimate Calculator: A project involving fully customizing the hardware of a TI-83+; this includes customization of the casing, adding a PS/2 mouse port, and at one point, even incorporating a PS/2 trackpad. There have been three incarnations of the Ultimate Calculator. Cemetech's many other past and present projects include web applications for trend aggregation and data mining, hardware and software projects for music visualization, many TI-BASIC and z80 Assembly programs, and research into parallelization, distributed computing, and image processing.  Awards and Media Attention  The projects above have individually gained attention from being featured on technology and DIY websites and blogs. Cemetech as a whole has gained more limited notoriety. It is well known in the hobbyist graphing calculator programming scene, and began to gain more widespread attention with its booth at World Maker Faire 2012 in New York City, entitled \\"Hacking Graphing Calculators: The Stealth Pocket Computer\\". Cemetech's founder was interviewed, and the booth won the Faire's Educators' Choice Award. Cemetech returned to Maker Faire with new projects and references in 2013 and won the Editors' Choice Award as well as a second consecutive Educators' Choice Award. = Cemetech and Color Graphing Calculators = In November 2012, Cemetech became one of the primary news sources introducing TI's new TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus CE and Casio's fx-CP400 graphing calculators. Both devices were released in Q2 2013, and brought large color screens to their respective models. Cemetech's revelations about the two devices were widely quoted by popular online technology news outlets.  Controversy and Criticism  Early in its history, Cemetech became embroiled in drama wrecking the Texas Instruments calculator hobbyist scene, partly stemming from a premature announcement of the Doors CS project. Various community members spoofed user accounts in an attempt to further discredit Cemetech. Cemetech's growth and gradual gain in reputation resolved these initial bumps but in recent years have introduced a tension between the site and fellow community site Omnimaga, occasionally spawning backlash from one or both sites. In early 2011, Cemetech's members took a vocal stand against Texas Instruments' educational division for the TI-Nspire CX graphing calculator to be introduced in Spring 2011, calling on community members to \\"ignore the Nspire CX and get a [...] Prizm\\" from TI competitor Casio. While much of the hobbyist community agreed with the letter or spirit of the proclamation, a discussion between teachers and community members on a semi-official TI-Nspire discussion group prompted criticism of Cemetech's attitude as contrary to the purpose of TI's calculators, explified in \\"[o]ne thing that [...] is NOT wrong is TI's refusal to make the NSpire a platform for Doom or Quake or any other distraction that kids enjoy. These things may be fun, but they aren't about learning math\\".

Gameplay The basic choice of teams span from the 1966 Green Bay Packers (the winners of Super Bowl I) to the 1982 Washington Redskins (the winners of Super Bowl XVII - the most recent Super Bowl as of the game's release). The game uses a top-down perspective in order to properly simulate the football field. The game shows the football field as a small, thin strip divided into ten-yard lines. Four basic graphics (the blue players playing the role as the defense and the black players playing the role as the offense) are considered to be \\"simulated American football players.\\" A notable criticism of the game is that having X's and O's would have been more realistic (because coaches use these in real-life football to write playbooks for the team players). Twenty different plays can be called from the line of scrimmage with ten different outcomes depending on the defensive alignment. The display shows a minimal coverage of the action; with no movement by either the quarterback or the wide receivers.

Photograph taken from aboard . The convoy‚Äîa group of merchantmen or troopships traveling together with a naval escort‚Äîwas revived during World War I (1914‚Äì18), after having been discarded at the start of the Age of Steam. Although convoys were used by the Royal Navy in 1914 to escort troopships from the Dominions, and in 1915 by both it and the French Navy to cover their own troop movements for overseas service, they were not systematically employed by any belligerent navy until 1916. The Royal Navy was the major user and developer of the modern convoy system, and regular transoceanic convoying began in June 1917. They made heavy use of aircraft for escorts, especially in coastal waters, an obvious departure from the convoy practices of the Age of Sail. As historian Paul E. Fontenoy put it, \\"[t]he convoy system defeated the German submarine campaign.\\"Paul E. Fontenoy, \\"Convoy System\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 312‚Äì14. From June 1917 on, the Germans were unable to meet their set objective of sinking of enemy shipping per month. In 1918, they were rarely able to sink more than . Between May 1917 and the end of the war on 11 November 1918, only 154 of 16,539 vessels convoyed across the Atlantic had been sunk, of which 16 were lost through the natural perils of sea travel and a further 36 because they were stragglers. Development=Origins= The first large convoy of the war was the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) convoy. On 18 October 1914, the Japanese battlecruiser left the port of Wellington, New Zealand, with 10 troopships. They joined 28 Australian ships and the Australian light cruisers and Melbourne at Albany, Western Australia. The Japanese also sent the cruiser to patrol the Indian Ocean during the convoy's crossing to Aden. During the crossing, HMAS Sydney was caught up in the Battle of Cocos (9 November), but the Japanese-escorted convoy reached Aden on 25 November. The Japanese continued to escort ANZAC convoys throughout the war.Hirama Yoichi, \\"Anzac Convoy (October 1914)\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 114. The convoys of Dominion troops were, weather permitting, escorted into port by airships.John J. Abbatiello, Anti-submarine Warfare in World War I: British Naval Aviation and the Defeat of the U-boats (Oxford: Routledge, 2006), 109‚Äì11. With the advent of commerce raiding by the submarines of the Royal Navy, the Imperial Russian Navy, and the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy), it was neutral Sweden, at the insistence of Germany, that first used a convoy system in early November 1915 to protect its own merchant shipping after the British and the Russians attacked its iron ore shipments to Germany. The German merchant fleet proposed a similar expedient, but the navy refused. However, in April 1916, Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia‚Äîcommander-in-chief in the Baltic theater‚Äîapproved regular scheduled escorts for German ships to Sweden. Losses to enemy submarines were drastically cut from the level of the previous year, and only five freighters were lost before the war's end.Paul E. Fontenoy, \\"Submarine Warfare, Allied Powers\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 1122‚Äì24. The author refers to a five-ship Turkish \\"convoy\\" driven ashore by the submarine Nerpa of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 5 September 1915, where it was shelled by destroyers. In June 1916, the Baltic Fleet attacked a German convoy in the Br√•viken, destroying the Q-ship Schiff H and some Swedish merchantmen, before mistakes by the commander of the Destroyer Division‚ÄîAleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak‚Äîallowed the majority of the convoy to escape back to Norrk√∂ping.Claude R. Sasso and Spencer C. Tucker, \\"Kolchak, Aleksandr Vasiliyevich (1874‚Äì1920)\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 642‚Äì43. =Revival= To cover trade with the neutral Netherlands, the British instituted their first regular convoy on 26 July 1916, from the Hook of Holland to Harwich, a route targeted by the German U-boats based out of Flanders. Only one straggler was lost before the Germans announced unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917, and only six after that before the war's end despite 1,861 sailings. The Holland convoys were sometimes referred to as the \\"Beef Trip\\" on account of the large proportion of food transported. They were escorted by destroyers of the Harwich Force and, later in the war, by AD Flying Boats based out of Felixstowe. The first convoys to sail after the German announcement were requested by the French Navy, desirous of defending British coal shipments. The Royal Navy's first coal convoy crossed the Channel on 10 February. These convoys were more weakly escorted, and contained a mixture of both steam- powered ships and sailing ships, as well as escorting aircraft based on the coast. In all, only 53 ships were lost in 39,352 sailings. When shippers from Norway (the \\"neutral ally\\") requested convoys in 1916 after a year of very serious losses, but refused to accept the routes chosen by the Admiralty, they were declined. After the German proclamation, the Norwegians accepted British demands and informal convoying began in late January or February 1917, but regular convoys did not begin until 29 April. That same day, the first coastal convoy left Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, the destination of the Norwegian convoys, for the Humber. This was to become a regular route. The Norwegian and coastal convoys included airships based out of Scotland (and in the latter case also Yorkshire). Although the British War Cabinet proposed convoys in March 1917, the Admiralty still refused. It was not until of shipping were lost to U-boats in April (and British Isles grain reserves had dropped to a six-week supply) that the Admiralty approved convoying all shipments coming through the north and south Atlantic. Rear Admiral Alexander Duff, head of the Antisubmarine Division, suggested it on 26 April, and the First Sea Lord, Admiral John Jellicoe, approved it the next day. Escorts were to be composed of obsolete cruisers, armed merchant cruisers and pre-dreadnought battleships for the oceanic portion of the routes, while in the more dangerous waters around Britain they were composed of destroyers. Observation balloons, especially kytoons, were used to help spot submarines beneath the surface, the aircraft carrier not then being developed. During discussions in March, it was determined that 75 destroyers were needed, but only 43 were available. The first experimental convoy of merchant vessels left Gibraltar on 10 May 1917 and arrived at the Downs on 22 May, having been accompanied by the last leg of its journey by a flying boat from the Scillies. =Maturation= The first transatlantic convoy left Hampton Roads on 24 May escorted by the armored cruiser , met up with eight destroyers from Devonport on 6 June, and brought all its ships save one straggler that was torpedoed, into their respective ports by 10 June. The first regular convoy left Hampton Roads on 15 June, the next left Sydney, Nova Scotia on 22 June, and another left New York for the first time on 6 July. The Sydney convoy had to be diverted to Halifax during winter months. The first regular convoy from the south Atlantic commenced on 31 July. Fast convoys embarked from Sierra Leone‚Äîa British protectorate‚Äîwhile slow ones left from Dakar in French West Africa. Gibraltar convoys became regular starting on 26 July. Losses in convoy dropped to ten percent of those suffered by independent ships. Confidence in the convoy system grew rapidly in the summer of 1917, especially as it was realised that the ratio of merchant vessels to warship could be higher than previously thought. While the first convoys comprised 12 ships, by June they contained 20, which was increased to 26 in September and 36 in October. The U.S. Navy's liaison to Britain‚ÄîRear Admiral William Sims‚Äîand its ambassador‚ÄîWalter H. Page‚Äîwere both strong supporters of convoying and opponents of Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare. Shortly after the U.S. entered the war, Sims brought over 30 destroyers to the waters around Britain to make up the Royal Navy's deficit. The success of the convoys forced the German U-boats in the Atlantic to divert their attention from inbound shipping to outbound. In response, the first outbound convoy left for Hampton Roads on 11 August 1917. It was followed by matching outbound convoys for each regular route. These were escorted by destroyers as they left Britain and were taken over by the typical cruiser fotillas as they entered the open ocean. Tonnage of British and neutral shipping lost in 1917 and 1918, showing failure of unrestricted U-boat warfare. The German admiralty's target was only reached in the first few months, although it grossly overestimated its successes. The Germans again responded by changing strategy and concentrating on the Mediterranean theater, where the extremely limited use of convoys had been approved at the Corfu Conference (28 April‚Äì1 May 1916).William P. McEvoy and Spencer C. Tucker, \\"Mediterranean Theater, Naval Operations (1914‚Äì1918)\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 774‚Äì77. The Mediterranean proved a more difficult zone for convoying than the Atlantic, because its routes were more complex and the entire sea was considered a danger zone (like British home waters). There the escorts were not provided only by Britain. The French Navy, U.S. Navy, Imperial Japanese Navy, Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) and Brazilian Navy all contributed. The first routes to receive convoy protection were the coal route from Egypt to Italy via Bizerte, French Tunisia, and that between southern metropolitan France and French Algeria. The U.S. took responsibility for the ingoing routes to Gibraltar, and increasingly for most of the eastern Mediterranean. The commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, Somerset Calthorpe, began introducing the convoy system for the route from Port Said to Britain in mid-October 1917. Calthorpe remained short of escorts and was unable to cover all Mediterranean trade, but his request to divert warships from convoy duty to the less effective Otranto Barrage was denied by the Admiralty.Patricia Roberts, \\"Calthorpe, Sir Somerset (1864‚Äì1937)\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 249‚Äì50. With the gradual success of the Mediterranean convoys, the Germans began to concentrate on attacking shipping in Britain's coastal waters, as convoyed vessels dispersed to their individual ports. Coastal convoy routes were only added gradually due to the limited availability of escorts, but by the end of the war almost all sea traffic in the war zones was convoyed. The coastal convoys relied heavily on air support. After June 1918, almost all convoys were escorted in part by land-based airplanes and airships, as well as sea planes. The organisation of these convoys had also been delegated by the Admiralty to local commanders. Admiralty resistance and objections The main objection of the Admiralty to providing escorts for merchant shipping (as opposed to troop transits) was that it did not have sufficient forces. In large part, this was based on miscalculation. The Admiralty's estimates of the number of vessels requiring escort and the number of escorts required per convoy‚Äîit mistakenly assumed a 1:1 ratio between escorts and merchant vessels‚Äîwere both wrong. The former error was exposed by Commander R. G. H. Henderson of the Antisubmarine Division and Norman Leslie of the Ministry of Shipping, who showed that the Admiralty was relying on customs statistics that counted each arrival and departure, concluding that 2,400 vessels a week, translating into 300 ships a day, required an escort. In fact, there were only 140 ships per week, or 20 per day, on transoceanic voyages. But the manageability of the task was not the Admiralty's only objection. It alleged that convoy presented larger and easier targets to U-boats, and harder object to defend by the Navy, raising the danger of the submarine threat rather than lowering it. It cited the difficulty of coordinating a rendezvous, which would lead to vulnerability while the merchant ships were in the process of assembling, and a greater risk of mines. The Admiralty also showed a distrust of the merchant skippers: they could not manoeuvre in company, especially considering that the ships would have various top speeds, nor could they be expected to keep station. At a conference in February 1917, some merchant captains raised the same concerns. Finally, the Admiralty suggested that a large number of merchantmen arriving simultaneously would be too much tonnage for the ports to handle, but this, too, was based in part on the miscalculation. In light of the cult of the offensive, the convoy was also dismissed a \\"defensive\\". In fact, it reduced the number of available targets for U-boats, forcing them to attack well-defended positions and usually giving them only a single chance, since the escorting warships would respond with a counterattack. It also \\"narrowed to the least possible limits [the area in which the submarine is to be hunted]\\", according to the Anti- Submarine Report of the Royal Navy Air Service (RNAS) of December 1917.Abbatiello (2006), 111. In that month, the First Lord of the Admiralty‚ÄîEric Geddes‚Äîremoved Admiral Jellicoe from his post of First Sea Lord because of the latter's opposition to the convoy system, which Prime Minister David Lloyd George had appointed Geddes to implement.Raymond Westphal Jr. and Spencer C. Tucker, \\"Geddes, Sir Eric Campbell (1875‚Äì1937)\\", The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History, Volume 1, Spencer C. Tucker, ed. (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), 468‚Äì69. Organisation=Types of convoy= According to John Abbatiello, there were four categories of convoy used during World War I. The first category consists of the short- distance convoys, such as those between Britain and its European allies, and between Britain and neutral countries. The commercial convoys between England and the Netherlands or Norway are examples, as are the coal convoys between England and France. The second category consists of the escorts of warships, usually troopships, such as those from the Dominions in the early stages of the war. These formed the earliest convoys, but \\"probably the most overlooked category\\". The British Grand Fleet itself could be included in this category, since it was always escorted by a destroyer screen in the North Sea and frequently by long-range Coastal and North Sea-class airships. The third category is the so-called \\"ocean convoys\\" that safeguarded transoceanic commerce. They traversed the Atlantic from the U.S. or Canada in the north, or from British or French colonial Africa or Gibraltar in the south. The fourth category is the \\"coastal convoys\\", those protecting trade and ship movements along the coast of Britain and within British home waters. Most coastal and internal sea traffic was not convoyed until mid-1918. These convoys involved the heavy use of aircraft. =Structure of command= With the success of the convoy system, the Royal Navy created a new Convoy Section and a Mercantile Movements Division at the Admiralty to work with the Ministry of Shipping and the Naval Intelligence Division to organise convoys, routings and schedules. Before this, the Norwegian convoys, coal convoys and Beef Trip convoys had often been arranged by local commanders. The Admiralty arranged the rendezvous, decided which ships would be escorted and in what order they would sail, but it left the composition of the escort itself to the Commander-in- Chief, Plymouth. The wing captain of the Southwest Air Group also received notification of the Admiralty's convoys, and provided air cover as they approached their ports. The Enemy Submarine and Direction Finding Section and the code-breakers of Room 40 cooperated to give the convoy planners knowledge U-boat movements. With the advent of coastal convoys, escort composition and technique fell into the hands of the district commanders-in-chief.Abbatiello (2006), 108. =Use of aircraft= In April 1918, the airship NS-3 escorted a convoy for 55 hours, including patrols at night both with and without moonlight. In complete darkness the airship had to stay behind the ships and follow their stern lights. The only value in such patrols was in maximising useful daylight hours by having the airships already aloft at dawn. In July, the Antisubmarine Division and the Air Department of the Admiralty considered and rejected the use of searchlights during night, believing the airships would render themselves vulnerable to surfaced U-boats. Testing of searchlights on aircraft revealed that the bomb payload needed to be much reduced to accommodate searchlight systems. Parachute flares offered better illumination (and were less illuminating of the arships‚Ä≤ positions), but they weighed in at 80 pounds each, making them too costly to drop unless the rough position of the enemy was already known. The Admiralty restricted the use of lights on airships for recognition, emergencies and under orders from senior naval officers only.Abbatiello (2006), 28‚Äì29. Of the 257 ships sunk by submarines from World War I convoys, only five were lost while aircraft assisted the surface escort. On 26 December 1917, as an airship was escorting three merchantmen out of Falmouth for their rendezvous with a convoy, they were attacked three times in the space of 90 minutes, torpedoing and sinking two of the vessels and narrowling missing the third before escaping. The airship had been away at the time of the incident, which was one of the last of its kind. In 1918, U-boats attacked convoys escorted by both surface ships and aircraft only six times, sinking three ships in total out of thousands. Because of the decentralised nature of the convoy system, the RNAS had no say in the composition or use of air escorts. The northeast of England led the way in the use of aircraft for short- and long-range escort duty, but shore-based aerial \\"hunting patrols\\" were widely considered a superior use of air resources. Subsequent historians have not agreed, although they have tended to overstress the actual use made of aircraft in convoy escort duty. An Admiralty staff study in 1957 concluded that the convoy was the best defence against enemy attacks on shipping, and dismissed shore-based patrols while commending the use of air support in convoying.For a revised edition of the staff study, cf. Freddie Barley and David Waters (eds.), The Defeat of the Enemy Attack of Shipping, 1939‚Äì45 (Aldershot: Ashgate for The Navy Records Society, 1997). Barley and Waters conclusions about hunting patrols vis-√†-vis convoys were followed by Arthur Marder, From Dreadnought to Scapa Flow, 5 vols. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1961‚Äì70), quoted in Abbatiello (2006), 82. NotesExternal links * Miller B., Michael: Sea Transport and Supply , in: 1914-1918-online.

Callanwolde is also involved in community outreach, specializing in senior wellness, special needs, veterans, and low income families. The mansion known as \\"Callanwolde\\" was built by Charles Howard Candler, President of The Coca-Cola Company (1916, 1920-1923), Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Emory University (nearly 30 years), and eldest son of Asa Griggs Candler who founded The Coca-Cola Company. Callanwolde is a Gothic-Tudor style mansion situated on a landscaped 12.5-acre estate and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Support  Support is provided to Callanwolde Fine Arts Center through a grant appropriated by the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners, in part by DeKalb County Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs, and in part by the Georgia Council for the Arts through appropriations of the Georgia General Assembly. Georgia Council for the Arts is a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts.  The Candler Family  Callanwolde was the home of the family of Charles Howard Candler, known as Howard, (1878-1957) from 1920 until 1959. Howard Candler was the oldest son of Asa Griggs Candler (1851-1929), the Atlanta pharmacist who, in 1891 purchased the rights to the formula for Coca- Cola, which had been developed by another Atlanta pharmacist, John S. Pemberton, in 1886 as a tonic for most common ailments. Howard Candler attended public elementary schools in Atlanta and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Emory College (a Methodist Episcopal institution that was at that time located in Oxford, Georgia). While in Oxford in 1895, Howard Candler received a keg of Coca-Cola syrup from his father that he shared with his classmates ‚Äî the first Coca-Cola ever seen there. After graduating from Emory in 1898, Howard Candler attended Atlanta College of Physicians and Surgeons for two years and the University of Bellvue Hospital Medical College for one year. Much later in life, in 1942, he received the Doctor of Laws degree from Emory University, which was by then located in Atlanta. In 1903, Howard Candler married Flora Harper Glenn. The couple had three children, Charles Howard, Jr. (born 1904), Catherine Harper (Mrs. William Warren) (born 1906), and Mary Louisa (Mrs. Alfred Eldridge) (born 1912).  The Candlers, Coca-Cola and Emory University  Emory University has been, and still is today, frequently called ‚ÄúCoca-Cola U‚Äù because of the long and generous history of patronage by both the Candler family and The Coca-Cola Company that they founded. In 1914, the decision was made to move Emory College from Oxford, Georgia. Howard's uncle, Bishop Warren Akin Candler, was President of Emory College and the Chairman of the Methodist Episcopal Education Commission. Atlanta's Chamber of Commerce pledged $500,000 if the new Emory University would locate in the city, and in 1915 Asa Griggs Candler donated a $1 million endowment to the institution. In 1915, Henry Hornbostel was engaged to design the new Emory campus in the Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta. The following year, Howard Candler, who had been a vice president of Coca-Cola since 1906, became the company's president, a position he held until his retirement from the company in 1923 (following its acquisition by the Woodruffs). His new position as head of the company meant that Howard Candler would now be the principal benefactor of Emory University. Work on his new home, Callanwolde, was begun the following year near the Emory campus and designed by Hornbostel. In 1929, Howard Candler became chairman of the board of trustees of Emory University, a position he held until his death in 1957. He continued the family's history of generous financial support of the institution as well. In 1947, for example, he gave the University assets valued in excess of $15 million. And, two years following Howard Candler's death, his widow donated the Callanwolde estate, along with many of the original furnishings, to Emory University. Emory subsequently sold the property to the First Christian Church, which retained ownership until the citizens of DeKalb County rallied to acquire Callanwolde in 1971.  Candler Ancestry and the Callanwolde Name  Candler family lore holds that William Candler of Newcastle upon Tyne served as an officer in Cromwell's Army during the Irish Rebellion of the mid-17th century. Candler served in Sir Hardress Waller‚Äôs Regiment and after the end of the campaign was elevated to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel for ‚Äúmeritorious conduct in the field‚Äù by a grateful Cromwell and Parliament and granted lands in the Barony of Callan, County Kilkenny. He brought his wife, Anne Villiers, widow of Capt. John Villiers, and family over to Ireland and made their Irish home at Callan Castle. The name ‚ÄúCallanwolde‚Äù is based on this family connection to the Irish town of Callan and the Old English word for ‚Äúwoods‚Äù (‚Äúwolde‚Äù). Recent genealogical research suggests that parts of this legend are, in fact, true, although as happens with all things, some details have been lost, changed, and exaggerated over the years. The estate is located in the Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta, which was planned by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Central Park in New York City and the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, NC. Of the estate's original 27 acres, approximately 12 remain intact. The grounds, which consist of sculptured lawns, formal gardens, nature trails and a rock garden, have been partially restored by the DeKalb County Federation of Garden Clubs and The Callanwolde Foundation, and are maintained by DeKalb County. Designed by Henry Hornbostel, who also designed Emory University, Callanwolde's plan is one of openness. Most rooms adjoin the great halls located on each floor, and the entire 27,000 square foot mansion is centered on a large, courtyard that has recently been enclosed. The attention to fine detail is evident in the excellent craftsmanship of the walnut panelling, stained glass, bronze balustrades, the artistry of the delicate ceiling and fireplace reliefs, and the pierced tracery concealing the Aeolian organ chambers. Callanwolde remained the Candlers‚Äô home for 39 years. In 1959, two years after Mr. Candler's death, and nine years prior to her own death, Mrs. Candler donated the estate (including many of the original furnishings) to Emory University. The house (minus the furnishings) was later acquired by the First Christian Church, which subsequently sold two parcels of the property totalling approximately four acres on one side and approximately 12 acres on the other. The mansion was temporarily leased to an artist who planned to establish an art gallery there. During this period, the condition of the mansion deteriorated. Considerable damage was done to the organ pipes; careless use of fire resulted in damage to the flooring in one bedroom; and lighting fixtures, door and window latches, and other hardware were stolen. Eventually, the church placed the remaining 12 acres, which included the mansion, the carriage house, a gardener's cottage, two greenhouses, and various out-buildings, up for sale. To save Callanwolde from possible destruction, a fund-raising drive was led, first by an ad hoc committee of the Druid Hills Civic Association, and later by The Callanwolde Foundation that formed from it. The property was purchased for $360,000 in 1972, with a matching funds grant from the open spaces program of the Federal Housing and Urban Development Department. DeKalb County contributed $40,000, accepted ownership of the property and agreed to maintain it. Callanwolde was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Callanwolde Fine Arts Center was opened under the supervision of the DeKalb County Recreation, Parks, and Cultural Affairs Department. In 1983, however, the non-profit Callanwolde Foundation accepted responsibility for the operation of the Callanwolde Fine Arts Center, although DeKalb County continues to maintain the house and grounds. Recent history During the Summer Olympics held in Atlanta in 1996, the house was transformed into ‚ÄúCasa Italia,‚Äù the official hospitality headquarters of the Italian Olympic Committee. Guests attending lavish parties hosted by the Italian delegation included such luminaries as Prince Albert of Monaco, Luciano Pavarotti, Andrew Young, Alberto Tomba, and a host of famous Italian fashion designers, chefs, Olympic athletes, artists and entertainers. Callanwolde has also served as a filming location for several Hollywood films, including ‚ÄúSharkey‚Äôs Machine,‚Äù starring Burt Reynolds, and ‚ÄúBear,‚Äù a feature film about the life of legendary football coach Bear Bryant. In 2003, Callanwolde served as the backdrop for several scenes used in the feature film ‚ÄúStroke of Genius, the Bobby Jones Story,‚Äù starring Jim Caviezel. Support to Callanwolde Fine Arts Center is provided through a grant appropriated by the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners, in part by DeKalb County Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs, and in part by the Georgia Council for the Arts through appropriations of the Georgia General Assembly. Georgia Council for the Arts is a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts. Callanwolde is also mentioned in Pat Conroy's novel, \\"The Prince of Tides.\\"  Architectural History  The mansion was built between 1917 and 1921 and is considered a severe and modern approach to the late Gothic Revival style of architecture. The front facade of the two and one-half story building has medieval half-timbered rhythmical design across the upper stories, crenellated bays and Tudor arches, as well as strapwork ornament, yet all of these elements of Tudor-Gothic design have been subjected to a simplicity or severity of design that is a uniquely 20th century approach to the use of these traditional design motifs. The construction is of poured concrete and steel and a rubble base of tile covered by stucco, and the house is built on a two-foot concrete foundation. All wooden floors are anchored to timbers laid in concrete over masonry units supported by reinforced concrete beams. This quality of construction explains the fact that no settlement is discernable in the building. Downstairs floors are of walnut with walnut pegs, with the exception of the living room which has white oak flooring. Upstairs floors are of white oak. The house also features large rafters and panelling of walnut. The house has a central heating system featuring recessed units behind decorative metal screens. It was originally steam-heated, but was converted from coal to gas heat in the 1930s. A vacuum system was built into the house, but it is no longer operable. There was also a buzzer system with a control panel in the kitchen, however it no longer exists. The pipes of the Aeolian organ are accommodated in the infrastructure of the house in four separate chambers.  Callanwolde‚Äôs Architect: Henry Hornbostel (1867-1961)  Callanwolde was designed by architect Henry Hornbostel of Pittsburgh. Hornbostel, born in Brooklyn, New York, was classically trained at Columbia University in New York City and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. He began work in Pittsburgh in 1904 after winning the Carnegie Technical Schools Competition for the design of the campus that is now Carnegie Mellon University. He founded the Department of Architecture at Carnegie Tech, and, in addition to a private practice in Pittsburgh, he taught at Columbia University and was at various times a partner in the New York firms of Howell, Stokes & Hornbostel; Wood, Palmer & Hornbostel; Palmer & Hornbostel; and Palmer, Hornbostel & Jones. Although the bulk of his practice centered in and around Pittsburgh, Hornbostel executed projects throughout the country, including the campus plans of Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh, Emory University in Atlanta, and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois; several bridges in New York City; and government buildings in Albany, NY and Oakland, CA. One of the many enduring structures Henry Hornbstel designed was the Williamsburg Bridge (1903) in New York City. Connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn, and designed by Hornbostel and Leffert L. Buck, the 1,600 foot bridge took over seven years to complete. When the bridge opened in 1903, it was the first all-steel, large-scale suspension bridge built in the country ‚Äìand the longest of its kind in the world. It remained the world's longest suspension bridge until the 1920s. Hornbostel apparently met Howard Candler through a project for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1915, he designed the master plan for Emory University when it was relocated to Atlanta from Oxford, Georgia. Hornbostel's work, while drawing heavily on historic precedents of Gothic, Tudor, and Renaissance styles, foreshadows the beginnings of a modernist sensibility in its stripped- down use of forms and relative absence of ornamentation. In this, it represents a transitional period between the academic classicism and gothic revival of the 19th century and the modernist movement of the 20th century. The Henry Hornbostel Collection is housed in the Architecture Archives of Carnegie Mellon University's Libraries. Drawings, Plans and other information about the original design of the Emory University Campus are maintained by the University Library's Special Collections.

GoPets was a virtual pet site that involved raising a customized three-dimensional pet downloaded onto a user's computer. GoPets was launched on August 4, 2005 and closed on November 8, 2009. GoPets resided not only on their owners' computers, but also visited GoPets members around the world when sent, invited or when pets decide to travel on their own. To provide a means of communication among users who speak different languages, GoPets had a universal iconic language called \\"IKU.\\" The GoPets service also contained chat services and a forum. Basics=Pets= Players on GoPets had the ability to create a pet. After selecting which animal they desire, they had the opportunity to customize their new GoPet by selecting from a list of pre-set colors and patterns. Once the initial creation process was complete, the GoPet was brought into existence to reside on the player's desktop. If players desired further customization, they could dress their pet up with unique clothing items, and equip different transportation vehicles such as cars or planes. Many equipable items hold trainable animations that GoPets could be taught to use when their stats were at a certain level. GoPets were social, and enjoyed interacting with other GoPets. These interactions included conversations, games, and professions of love and friendship which may result in a communal dance. GoPets loved to travel around desktops of players all around the world in search of other places where there were treated politely and affectionately. GoPets never died or became sick, despite the lack of care or how low their status might have become. However, GoPets would respond negatively to ill care and leave their owners' desktop frequently. For example, when very tired, GoPets would fall asleep often. =GoLand= GoLand was a GoPets term referring to a players desktop. New users were taken to a community desktop where books, food and clothing are able to be purchased. A user could purchase their own piece of GoLand by using the GoLand Map and searching for either a camping site or a tier 1 land. Camping sites were shown by a green paw, and only cost 1000 green shells; while the tier 1 lands were shown by an orange paw and cost 75 gold shells. Camping sites only allowed 75 items to be placed onto the desktop, while a tier 1 land allowed 250 items for non-subscribers, and 400 items for premium subscribers. Players could decorate their desktop with countless objects and toys for GoPets to play and interact with. GoPets could use many of the items by themselves. One popular item was a bathtub, which GoPets would utilize when their cleanliness status is low. In addition to toys and food, GoPets owners could place decorative items on the desktop, such as trees, shrubs or ponds. They could also mark items for sale, allowing visitors to their desktop to purchase these items at will. =Currency= The GoPets currency was known as the shell (they are simply colored seashells); green shells were the lowest denomination, pink shells were second, and gold shells were considered the most valuable. Gold Shells could be purchased for real money through Gopets, for US$0.10 per shell. At the trading forum, some players traded shells for another, but the exchange rate could be rather outrageous ((100 gold shell: 500 pink shells: 20000 green shells)). All types of shells, as well as numerous items, could be found in fortune cookies; Green Tea Fortune Cookies were given Daily to un-subscribed users, while special Premium Fortune Cookies were given to the Subscribers. The player's currency of Gold Shells to Pink Shells to Green Shells changed after GoPets discovered a flaw in their fortune cookie system which gave a higher payout of gold shells than a person who would buy the prepaid cards. Due to this, GoPets changed and revised the fortune cookie system making a daily maximum payout of 10 Gold Shells from pink fortune cookies. Pink shells could only be used by Subscribers. Gameplay Users could interact with the GoPets on their desktop, by feeding them, petting them, playing with them, sending them to other players. GoPets could own micropets, little pets for your pets. Micropets included the Spring Butterfly, Baby Chick, Owl, Parrot, Penguin, and many others. Occasionally, micropets would make noise, and pets equipped with a micropet had their stats decreased at a faster pace. GoPets provided a Child Safety Mode which, once activated, allows the guardian to establish a Protector ID that limited the functions available for underage users.

He was a NASA human factors engineer on the first Apollo mission and was best known for his refutation of Carl Sagan's attempts to locate extraterrestrial life in outer- space. Biography Catran was born on January 22, 1918, to a Sephardic Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in the neighborhood of Bensonhurst where he began participating in vaudevillian theater during the 1930s and 1940s, and became interested in science as well. He had dropped out of high school but moved to Los Angeles in 1941 where he attended Chouinard Art Institute under the GI Bill. He returned to school at USC and UCLA where he earned his master's degree in psychology. He began teaching technical illustration and perspective drawing at the Van Nuys High School, Van Nuys Adult School, and San Fernando High School where he employed experimental psychology techniques in his methods.I. II. III. He began his career as a technical and industrial designer for the aerospace industry in Los Angeles. He later attended the University of London to obtain his doctorate in psychology. He began working for the NASA Apollo space program as a human factors engineer. Meanwhile, he was editor of the journal, Feedback. He also became president of the Beth Daiah Temple. He became an instructor at the experimental Cal State University, Northridge where he taught such controversial classes as \\"Charm and Sex Appeal.\\" In the early 1980s, he wrote a series of articles in The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, and the Humanist in response to the attempts of some cosmologists, primarily Carl Sagan, to theorize and locate the existence of intelligent life in outer-space. In 1980, he wrote the underground classic Is There Intelligent Life On Earth which thoroughly attempted to refute the whole idea of SETI. In the book he also argued that the global monetary system is the central cause of societal ills and that eventually the money system would give way to a moneyless technologically governed society that would eliminate waste, poverty, and crime. He was also one of the few scientists to argue that humans are probably alone in the universe. Catran appeared on radio and television arguing his point. A national television show attempted to arrange a debate between Catran and Sagan, but Sagan turned it down. He later became interested in linguistics and became a consultant for 20th Century Fox. He trained such actors as John Belushi and Richard Burton to speak with various accents. He would eventually write a series of books and audio tapes entitled How To Speak English Without A Foreign Accent which provided exercises for speakers to lose accents across fifteen different languages. He became a prominent radio show host in the 1980s and 1990s in Los Angeles area, hosting a show on KGIL where he assisted callers in eliminating their accents. Catran published Walden Three in 1988. Following on the philosophical and ideological orientation of B. F. Skinner's Walden Two, it was a 422-page science fiction scenario with occasional sections of biographical memoir, both of which centered on the life and philosophy of Jacque Fresco via pseudonymous protagonist \\"Jack Tedesco.\\" Catran later hosted the midnight show, Brooklyn Bridge, featuring entertainers from the 1930s and 1940s.

Milken Archive of Jewish Music. milkenarchive.org. Retrieved 2016-12-13. Yiddish theater composer Joseph Rumshinsky Biography Joseph Rumshinsky's mother taught singing to local singers and badkhonim (wedding entertainers). As a child, he studied with a cantor. At the age of eight he was called \\"Yoshke der notn-freser\\" at the music school where he studied piano. He traveled until 1894 with various Hazzanim. In Grodno he first saw Yiddish theater (Abraham Goldfaden's operetta Shulamis); and joined the chorus of Kaminska's traveling troupe until 1896, when his voice changed. He then became choir director for a cantor named Rabinovitch. He married the actress Sabrina Laxer. Their son Maury was a pianist and composer as well. Music career His first composition was a piano waltz which became very popular in Vilna.Zylbercweig, Zalmen (1959). \\"Rumshinsky, Joseph.\\" Leksikon fun yidishn teater. Vol. 3. New York: Farlag \\"Elisheva.\\" Columns 2381-2407. In 1897 he became choir director for Borisov's Russian opera/operetta; in 1888 he conducted a full production of Goldfaden's Bar Kokhba. In 1899, in L√≥dz, he was hired as conductor of the new Hazomir Choral Society, studying and arranging folksongs as well as Haydn, Handel, and Mendelsohn oratorios. He studied with the Polish musician Henryk Meltzer and at the Warsaw Conservatory. In 1903 he left for London to avoid conscription in the czar's army. In London he met the New Yorker Charles Zunser, the son of the folk bard Eliakum Zunser), who convinced him to emigrate to the United States in 1904. Blocked by the union from working in the theater, he taught piano and wrote compositions including a funeral march commemorating the Kishinev pogrom. 1905-1906 he was director at Boston's Hope Theater. He then returned to New York, where he was still unable to work in theater. He was finally hired, in 1907, as director at Brooklyn's Lyric Theater, and a year later was taken on as conductor and composer at the Windsor Theater thanks to dramatic actor Jacob Adler. Sholem Perlmutter wrote: In 1912 Boaz Young (husband of famous actress Clara Young) wrote that when Rumshinsky/Shor's Di Amerikanerin - Dos Meydl fun der vest (The American girl - the maiden from the west) played in Warsaw, \\"Rumshinsky's music was so successful that not only Jews but also Poles sang it. It was sung in all the cabarets.\\" In New York he worked as a composer and director at Malvina Lobel's Royal Theater, from 1913 to 1914, and at Joseph Edelstein's Peoples Theater, from 1914 to 1916.Zylbercweig (1959), col. 2384. At the time, many American Yiddish productions were deemed shund (trash) \\"that encompassed a world of cheap pulp fiction, common periodicals, and other coarse diversions.\\" Rumshinsky tried to steer Yiddish musical entertainment away from what he called \\"elevated vaudeville\\" toward his own vision of a new American genre of Yiddish light operetta. In 1916 he joined with Boris Thomashefsky and worked as composer and conductor at the National Theater, scoring comedies and melodramas. His Tsubrokhene fidl (Broken Fiddle) boasted a full-sized dance corps and a full pit orchestra with two dozen musicians (most productions had previously used a small dance band or wedding band). (When he first added harp, oboe, and bassoon to his orchestrations, actors called him \\"crazy Wagner.\\") In 1919 he moved to the Kessler Second Avenue Theater in the Yiddish Theater District. In 1923 Rumshinsky introduced Molly Picon to Second Avenue in a production of Yankele. Molly Picon, her husband Jacob (Yankl) Kalich, and Rumshinsky were called \\"the Three Musketeers of the East Side\\" in a 1931 New York Times article. Rumshinsky wrote dozens of shows over the course of four decades. Beginning in the 1930s, he also worked in radio, becoming music director of the only Yiddish program broadcast on a nationwide network, The Jewish Hour, sponsored by the Yiddish daily newspaper Der Tog. He worked from 1946 to 1949 at Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theater, scoring Hershele ostropoler, Isaac Leib Peretz's Dray matones, and Sholem Aleichem's Blondzhende shtern.

The United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service maintains a popular recreation area for day use at the location of the falls. The falls are fed by springs located in the canyon above. The water flows through a series of streams and pools until reaching the falls where it drops 150 feet into the canyon below. Most of the water disappears into the gravel or cracks in the rocks and either reappears in springs further down the canyon or joins the Pecos Valley underground water supply. The area around Sitting Bull Falls is the remnant of a reef system known as the Capitan Great Barrier Reef dating from the Permian period. Approximately 250 million years ago, the region was located near the edge of an inland sea. The origin of the name Sitting Bull Falls remains uncertain. One version holds that the falls were named after a Sioux medicine man. The Apache name for the area was gostahanagunti which means hidden gulch. A number of hiking trails allow visitors access to the springs above the falls. A paved path connects the picnic area to the area around the bottom of the falls where wading and swimming are allowed.

She is a light-lyric voiced Afro-pop, recording and performing artist. She is also a resident of Dijon, France. Background She was born in the Central Region of Uganda. Namubiru attended several educational institutions, including: * Bugema Adventist Senior Secondary School in Luweero District * Namasagali College in Kamuli District * Airways Tourism & Hotel Institute * Stendhal University in Grenoble, France. * Cavendish University, Uganda While at Namasagali College, Namubiru met and became friends with Juliana Kanyomozi, another female Ugandan performing artist who was attending the college at the same time. Music career According to Namubiru, she has always had a passion for singing since her childhood and always strove to make this talent a bigger part of her life. Her first major attempt at success in the music industry came in 1995 when she joined singers-cum-rapper DJs Ragga Dee and Molar-Messe, as the group Da Hommies, and \\"Joss Jjew\\" Mawejje as studio arranger/keyboardist, helping release a series of singles including the group's hits \\"Bamusakata\\", \\"Mukwano\\", \\"Mukyala tokaba\\", early 1995. Her own first single \\"learn to say good bue\\" also appeared on the group's subsequent album to great acclaim. Soon afterwards, she had her first stage appearance in September 1995.The Beginnings of Namubiru's Music Career In 1999, she joined Kanyomozi, her former schoolmate at Namasagali College, to form the R&B; all- girl group called I-Jay.Iryn and Juliana Formed I-Jay in 1999 In 2000, they released their first 7 track album titled WAIT which included songs Wait RMX (Ft Steve Jean), Not Good Enough, Mwana, Wait, Emirimu, Vivi LA Vi and Two To Make It True... which got moderate air play on radio stations in Uganda. Soon after the release of their record, Namubiru left for France and the group disbanded. This break up would later lead to wide speculation that the two separated on unfriendly terms, although they both denied such rumours. While in France, she formed the Afro-Soul group Nujeli together with Julien Grout and they released ENSI LP. With Bryan Morel Muhumuza's account analysis and certification, this record had songs \\"Nsangi 3:44, Desurrection 5:36, Baami Baffe 4:20, Twins Play 3:42, Our Illness 4:51, Eko 3:26, Tuzze 2:21, Ansobela 2:55, Invitation √† la danse 2:28, Pleasures' Garden 3:40, Esprit es-tu l√† ? 3:46, Voler 5:20 and the title track Ensi. These songs were not successful in Uganda. Later on in 2006, Namubiru joined forces with singer Bebe Cool in the songs \\"Simbalala\\" and \\"Lwaki Onzannyilako?\\". However, Namubiru did not achieve widespread success until 2006 when she released her album Nkuweeki?.Namubiru Released Nkuweeki? In 2006 This marked the beginning of her fast rise to be one of the best female musicians in Uganda. Since 2006, Namubiru has released several successful songs like \\"Y'ono\\", \\"Lwaki\\", \\"Bonna Obasinga\\", \\"Begombeko\\", \\"Birowoozo\\", which have earned her several leading awards in the Ugandan music industry. In 2011, Namubiru capped her most successful year ever by winning in four categories of the 2011 PAM (Pearl of Africa Music) Awards. She won in the categories of Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Album of the Year and Best RnB Single of the Year. Controversies Namubiru has been widely criticised by her detractors for dressing \\"inappropriately\\" in her music videos and, at times, her concerts. Her critics charge that her costumes go against the traditional Ugandan way of dressing and set a bad example for other aspiring musicians. In 2009, her video for the hugely successful Bonna Obasinga was panned by several people, several of them fans, for going too far with the swimming costume she wore. She later decided to shoot another video for the song to placate her critics. However, many of her fans have defended her \\"creative\\" dressing against such accusations and blame them on those who are still socially backward and are not willing to try out new styles.Namubiru Threatened With Videos Ban Personal life Namubiru was married to Frank Galusy Morel, a Frenchman, and together they have two sons. She is fluent in English, French, and Luganda, her native tongue. She balances her career between her family in France, where she lives, and Uganda, where most of her music fans reside. On 24 November 2018 she survived an accident in Lake Victoria, where a cruise boat carrying party revellers capsized, killing 33 people.Uganda party boat capsizes on Lake Victoria, killing 33 Arrest in Japan On 3 May 2013 Namubiru was arrested in Tokyo, Japan for alleged possession of illegal drugs, where she had gone to perform at a music concert. Namubiru was arrested at Tokyo's Narita International Airport, before performing at the concert. Reportedly, her fans (said to be Ugandans in Japan) who had gathered at the concert venue, got to know about the arrest and as a result went to the airport, but the Japanese Police told them that Namubiru was travelling on a French passport and they could therefore do nothing to help her; she later sought help of the French Embassy in Japan. The week before the arrest, Namubiru had been tweeting about how excited she was that she was going to be performing in Japan. The concert was to take place at the Yotsukaido Cultural Hall in Tokyo, Japan's capital. Namubiru was found carrying ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine), the drug was concealed in her luggage. She was transferred from the Tokyo airport detention facility to a police station in Central Tokyo where she recorded a statement in connection to the possession of MDMA commonly known as \\"ecstasy\\" (being in possession of this drug is a crime in Japan); she however denied any knowledge of the drug. On 24 May 2013, at a hearing in Japan, the court did not find her guilty of drug-trafficking charges as the evidence provided by the state was not enough to pin the star to the level of a drug dealer, and so, now that the court had found Namubiru to be innocent, police in Japan had her cleared of drug trafficking charges and set her free.

He is best known for his work and activism which led the German court in L√ºbeck to overturn a 1939 verdict from World War II, regarding the defenders of the Polish Post Office in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk),\\"Dieter Schenk\\", profile at Web page of the city of Gda≈Ñsk, last accessed 3/29/2011 as well as his books on the widespread influence of ex-Nazis in post World War II Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). Schenk is a former Kriminaldirektor of Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), located in Wiesbaden, where he was the agency's contact with Interpol. He left the agency in 1989 because of what he describes as \\"the ignorance of the BKA concerning the violation of human rights in torturing regimes\\".Schenk's CV Work on the defense of Gda≈Ñsk post office Captured defenders of the Polish Post Office in Danzig, 1939. During the Nazi invasion of Poland, the Germans also carried out attacks on Polish controlled building in the Free City of Danzig (Wolne Miasto Gda≈Ñsk), including the post office, which constituted extraterritorial Polish property. The Polish defense of the building, carried out by 55 lightly armed postmen against more than 200 German SS (Schutzstaffel), SA (Sturmabteilung) and police troops, lasted for 15 hours. The Poles surrendered after the German forces used automatic pumps, gasoline tanks and flamethrowers to set the building on fire. Polish casualties were 6 killed during the fighting and 2 more killed while they were trying to surrender with a white flag. Four of the defenders managed to escape and six died in a Gestapo hospital. The rest were imprisoned, tortured, tried (with a single Wehrmacht officer as defense lawyer)Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 96 by a Wehrmacht court-martial and sentenced to death. 28 of the judgements were countersigned, and thus became legally valid, by General Hans G√ºnther von Kluge, another 10 by Colonel Eduard WagnerDieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 103 A clemency appeal was rejected by Walther von BrauchitschDieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 106 (who was to be charged after the war with crimes against humanity, but died while in custody)Mark Grossman, World military leaders: a biographical dictionary, Infobase Publishing, 2007, pg. 48 and carried out on September 8 and 30. Schenk began researching the events in 1993 and published a book, Die Post von Danzig: Geschichte eines deutschen Justizmords (\\"The Post Office of Gda≈Ñsk: History of a German judicial murder\\"), which led to the revision of the verdict. He figured out that the German forces were Danzig police-, SS- and SA-men, commanded by a Danzig police officer, and only at a subsequent stage regular Wehrmacht forces did take part in the fighting. Thus a Wehrmacht court martial was not competent to convict the defenders. Instead, the Free City of Danzig's penal law would have been applicable, without the alternative of a death penalty. As a result, the judgements were nullified and the Polish defenders were \\"rehabilitated\\" by the L√ºbeck court. A symbolic reparation was made to the victims' families. On their initiative, Schenk was declared an honorary citizen of Gda≈Ñsk in 2003. Honors and awards Schenk is also an honorary professor of University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ where he has taught classes as a lecturer, and a recipient of the Fritz Bauer Prize from the Humanist Union (2003), named after Fritz Bauer the German prosecutor and judge who strove to obtain justice and compensation for victims of the Nazi regime, and contributed to the capture of Adolf Eichmann in Argentina. He is a founding member of the task group Amnesty International Police Working Group, Germany (Sektionsarbeitsgruppe Polizei bei Amnesty International). Other works Dieter Schenk has also published books on the Nazi Gauleiter of Danzig-West Prussia, Albert Forster, Hitlers Mann in Danzig (\\"Hitler's man in Gda≈Ñsk\\"). In this book, Schenk documented that even after the end of the Intelligenzaktion in Pomerania (an organized Nazi action aimed at the elimination of the Polish intelligentsia in Pomerania during which the Germans executed between 36,000 and 42,000 Poles and Jews in the region), the Gestapo continued to carry out judicial murders (Justizmord).Andrzej Gasiorowski, in Chrzanowski et al, Polska Podziemna na Pomorzu w Latach 1939-1945, Oskar, Gdansk, 2005, pg. 570 His other books include Krakauer Burg: Die Machtzentrale des Generalgouverneurs Hans Frank 1939-1945 (\\"Krakow's Castle: The power center of the Governor General Hans Frank 1939-1945\\") (2010)\\"About the author\\", from Krakauer Burg: Die Machtzentrale des Generalgouverneurs Hans Frank 1939-1945, Ch.

Ravenwood Fair was launched on the Facebook platform October 19, 2010. The game closed down on July 18, 2013. Overview The object of the game was to build a fun fair in the midst of a scary forest while decorating the grounds, fending off various monsters, and completing many quests. Players built games and buildings which attract visitors to the fair, and visitors became scared if they see a monster or the forest erupts near them. Players comforted the visitors when they were scared so they could go back to their normal routine of enjoying the fair. Gameplay The player selects an avatar which resembles a woodland animal - either a raccoon (named Rita) or bear (named Randy). The player then completes a short tutorial that shows how to chop trees, pick up loot drops, then build a hotdog cart. After the tutorial, the player is given several quests that direct gameplay toward accumulating materials, building structures, or purchasing decorations and placing them. The player has an energy bar which determines how many major actions the player can take in a session. More energy can be purchased with mushrooms or Facebook credits to extend gameplay. Mushrooms randomly drop from trees that are chopped down. Chopping trees and roots are a large part of gameplay. One chop on a tree or root will use an energy. Loot drops from the chopped tree or root and will contain coins, XP (experience points), and often materials needed for quests and building structures. Sometimes a monster, such as a Crittle Bear or Domovoi, will appear as a result of chopping a tree and the player can either ignore the monster or pummel it with a shovel to scare it away. When the player finishes building a structure, the \\"fun\\" value attached to the structure accumulates with all other structures in the fair. At various \\"fun\\" levels, visitors will fly in on a zeppelin and roam the player's fair, playing games and using buildings and paying coins and XP for them. All during gameplay, the scary forest erupts randomly with evil laughter, will-o-wisps, or a frightening crow. If a visitor is near a scary part of the forest, the visitor will scream and run to the player for comfort. The player must then click on the scared visitor to comfort them so they can continue enjoying the fair. If the player places a Protector on the ground, it will be able to retaliate against the forest, attack monsters, and comfort the scared visitors. After the player gathers enough XP, they will level up and have their energy meter filled, and possibly extended. Attaining levels will affect the game in various ways, such as unlocking items for purchase in the store (called Ye Olde Shoppe), new quests becoming available, new monsters appearing when trees are chopped, etc. Popularity As of March 2011, Ravenwood Fair had approximately 25 million players worldwide. Ravenwood Fair has launched on several other social networks such as Japan's Mixi, IMVU, South America's Orkut, and Germany's StudiVZ. The game can be played in 9 languages: English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, Italian, Indonesian, German, French, and Portuguese. Development Lolapps began working on a game called Critter Town in January 2010 using Sean Cooper's fl engine. This game was redesigned multiple times over a 7-month period, until Lolapps asked Brenda Brathwaite, their new Creative Director, for help in finishing the game. Brathwaite suggested bringing in John Romero to redesign the game and lead it to completion. Romero arrived at Lolapps on August 1, 2010 and worked with a team of 11 developers to create Ravenwood Fair and launch it on October 19, 2010. The game is full of references to popular culture. The game has been praised for its beautiful painterly art style. The title theme music track was composed and produced by Aaron Walz of Game Audio Alliance. An expansion to Ravenwood Fair named Ravenstone Mine was announced in February and launched April 20, 2011. In October 2010, Lolapps, Inc. was the subject of a shutdown by Facebook just days before Ravenwood Fair launched, due to Lolapps using an advertising company named RapLeaf. Ravenwood Fair was shut down as well a week later for 7 days before becoming fully operational again. Because of the threat of another possible shutdown, Lolapps launched Ravenwood Fair on its own website off Facebook. On February 2, 2011, John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite gave an IGDA-sponsored presentation titled From AAA To Social Games - Developing Ravenwood Fair at Dolby Laboratories in San Francisco, CA. On February 22, 2011, Romero and Brathwaite gave a presentation at the SF Game Developer's Workshop titled A Post Mortem of Ravenwood Fair at the Art Institute of California - San Francisco.  Further releases  After Ravenwood Fair, the follow-up games Ravenskye City and Ravenshire Castle were released by LOLapps. Together, these three games are referred to as RavenWorld. The music for the game was composed by Dren McDonald & Aaron Walz. It was released, together with the music of Ravenskye City and Ravenshire Castle, on the album The Music of RavenWorld. A total of nine titles are from Ravenwood Fair and three from the extension Ravenstone Mine. Nominations On January 19, 2011, The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences announced its 14th Interactive Achievement Award Nominees. In the category of \\"Social Networking Game of the Year\\", Ravenwood Fair was nominated along with CityVille, Family Feud, FrontierVille, and Nightclub City. CityVille won the award.

Increases in water-use efficiency are commonly cited as a response mechanism of plants to moderate to severe soil water deficits, and has been the focus of many programs that seek to increase crop tolerance of drought. However, there is some question as to the benefit of increased water-use efficiency of plants in agricultural systems, as the processes of increased yield production and decreased transpirational water loss (that is, the main driver of increases in water-use efficiency) are fundamentally opposed.Bacon, M. Water Use Efficiency in Plant Biology. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2004. . Print. If there existed a situation where water deficit induced lower transpirational rates without simultaneously decreasing photosynthetic rates and biomass production, then water-use efficiency would be both greatly improved and a desired trait in crop production.

In the case of the monetization of U.S. food aid, the U.S. provides food commodities for free or under favorable terms to a cooperating sponsor, which could be a recipient country‚Äôs government or an NGO working there. The recipient organization sells the commodities to local processors or traders who turn around and sell the commodity on the market in raw or processed form. Proceeds from the sale to the processors or traders support technical assistance projects or public infrastructure investments in the same country, or in the case of third-party monetization, another country in the region. Money can also be used in ‚Äútargeted monetization‚Äù, where the cooperating sponsor sells small quantities with the purpose of developing the market, reducing market volatility, or improving food access. According to a study by Barrett and Lentz, monetization in the United States is driven by the \\"iron triangle\\" of producers and processors, the U.S. shipping industry, and NGOs. Producers and processors supply almost all of the procurements of U.S. food aid through the USDA on behalf of USAID. Furthermore, U.S. law requires 75% of nonemergency food commodity tonnage be purchased, bagged, or processed, which provides U.S. companies with business. The law requires 50% of Title II grains to be bagged in the U.S. and 75% of U.S. food aid must ship on U.S. flag carrier vessels. Many NGOs also favor monetization because aid through monetization funds their programs. Monetization of food aid is controversial. Critics claim it carries the risks of other types of food aid, which include displacing imports and disruption of local markets. These issues have brought a number of objectors, including the WTO, U.S. commercial exporters, and recipient country producers and traders. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also called for an end to monetization in The State of Food and Agriculture report in 2006, alleging monetized food aid represents over 30% of project food aid globally and is \\"often a dangerous way of destroying local farm prices.\\" Additionally, monetization has been labeled ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù by a number of analyses, including that of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). For these reasons, some NGOs, such as CARE, have decided to reduce or forgo monetization in the future. Background thumb  right  alt= Chart Showing the Use of Monetization by Program Authority  Use of Monetization by Program Authority: Percentage of funds used for monetization and direct distribution Monetization of food aid is almost solely a practice of the United States and U.S.-based NGOs. The World Food Programme and European donors have discontinued most programs that provide food for monetization, while the United States government requires monetization by law. The Food Security Act of 1985 introduced this requirement by allowing ‚Äúcooperating sponsors‚Äù to cover administrative costs through the sale of United States in-kind food donations. In 1988, Title II PL 480 expanded to cover development projects as well, and non-emergency funding through monetization had a minimum level of 10%, which increased to 15% with the 1996 Farm Bill. Additionally, it allowed for third-party monetization, which means food aid can be sold in one county to generate money to finance emergency or development programs in another country. The Food for Progress Program and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program also allow for monetization. According to the Food for Peace Monetization Field Manual Title II food aid has two objectives, :First, Title II food aid monetization is programmed to enhance food security. Second, Title II food aid is used by a CS [cooperating sponsor] to generate foreign currency to support development activities. :Monetization offers the potential to improve the marketing of food to permit greater access to those who are food insecure. Indeed, there is an important direct link between food security and how food aid is monetized. The process of monetizing can be used to promote low-cost, competitive food markets by encouraging investment in transportation, infrastructure and human capital (traders, entrepreneurs). In essence, food aid monetization can enhance long- term food security by encouraging the development of competitive food marketing systems that have built-in incentives to provide the poor with affordable staple foods. The United States reinforced its dedication to food aid and monetization for nonemergency development through the 2008 Farm Bill. This bill enacted hard earmarks for the first time, setting annual minimum commitments for nonemergency Title II programs: $375 million in FY2009, $400 million in FY2010, $425 million in FY2011, $450 million in FY2012(Sect. 3021). However, a provision in the same bill (Sect. 3008) raised the cap on funding under Section 202(e), which allows cash resources to be ‚Äúmade available to Cooperating Sponsors for establishing new programs and meeting the specific administrative, management, and personnel costs of programs‚Äù(7 USC 1722(e)). Previously, the law restricted this funding to \\"not less than 5 percent nor more than 10 percent.\\" The 2008 Farm Bill raised those values to 7.5 and 13 respectively and expanded the list of uses for those funds, giving the Office of Food for Peace greater flexibility to provide cash to cooperating sponsors when monetization would not be appropriate. Since the introduction and subsequent changes of Title II, non-emergency food aid and the number of cooperating sponsors, most of which are US-based NGOs, have increased. Monetization of food aid was originally intended to help agencies cover the cost of distribution of food and implementation of food-based development programs. However, monetization has since become much more prevalent as more organizations enter the field and existing cooperating sponsors expand their programs. Programs have also become inclusive of other activities such as maternal and child health. According to a 2007 report from the United States Government Accountability Office, while the minimum level of nonemergency funding through monetization is 15%, it reached almost 70% in 2001. It declined to around 50% in 2005, likely due to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) recommendation to decrease monetization and due to the increasing demand for emergency food aid. In a report prepared by Mendez England and Associates for the U.S. Office of Food for Peace, monetization of Title II food aid increased from 1987 with $21 million and five cooperating sponsors in 19 countries to 1994 with $80 million and 43 projects in 24 countries. Between FY1999 and 2005, the overall contribution of monetized food aid could conservatively be as large as $900 million in support of projects with the assumption of a 60% recovery rate from the delivered commodities. This could be as high as $1.2 billion with an 80% recovery rate from US monetized Title II food aid. Potential effects Positive *Increases the quality and quantity of food available in the recipient country *Generates income for development projects and food distribution *Develops markets and stabilize local food prices Negative *Displaces imports *Disrupts local markets *Leads to dependency on aid in recipient countries *Creates inefficiency in monetary provision of aid According to the USAID Food for Peace Manual, ‚ÄúAbove and beyond the generation of funds for food security activities, monetization is one more tool among the set of programming options available to enhance the food security of vulnerable households through the use of U.S. food commodities.\\" Monetization also creates opportunities for American businesses to produce, process, and ship in-kind food aid. =Increase of Food Quantity and Nutritional Benefits= Food aid aims to provide additional food consumption to that which would have taken place without food aid. Calculating whether monetization of food aid causes additional food consumption can be complicated because food aid provided can displace food provided locally and through imports in the market. USAID uses the Bellmon analysis to determine the level of food that would have already been available on the market. The Bellmon analysis guidelines intend to ensure food aid provides, ‚Äúno substantial disincentive to domestic production and marketing.‚Äù ‚ÄúUsual Market Requirements‚Äù used by food aid organizations, Bellmon analyses, and Title II funding aim to ensure that monetization of food aid does not replace imports or displace local production completely. Thus, food aid can claim to provide additional food to what would have already been available. Among regular recipients of food aid in the 1999-2005 period, 32% of the value of food for monetization qualified as ‚Äúadditional.‚Äù Furthermore, the food provided from the United States is generally high quality and provides vitamins, minerals, protein, and energy. Value-added food aid products such as corn soy blend and wheat soy blend have provided nutrition to impoverished societies data shows, and processed foods require less time to cook, which results in less need for fuel. However, not all aid is as nutritionally valuable because monetization aims to maximize funding for programs rather than maximize nutrition. For example, the most common value addition to products is production of vitamin A-fortified vegetable oil. =Generation of Income for Development Projects and Food Distribution= Many cooperating sponsors see the most important advantage of food aid as the accomplishments of the projects established through funding provided by monetization and the future benefits of those projects. Projects funded through monetization address causes of hunger and malnutrition and aim to reduce the need for emergency food assistance. In 2001, the USDA released a report listing some of the projects monetization has funded. These range from ‚ÄúPromoting Agricultural Development in Cape Verde‚Äù to ‚ÄúFunding Agricultural Lending in Moldova.‚Äù The report includes 11 countries and concludes, ‚ÄúThe monetization of food aid commodities has significant food security and development impacts. In addition, monetization provides a modest benefit to U.S. farmers by contributing to U.S. agricultural exports. While there are challenges and constraints to the effective use of monetized proceeds, experience demonstrates that food aid monetization can be an effective resource for grassroots development in foreign countries.‚Äú However, the benefits of these projects are often descriptive, so the actual impact in numbers and estimates on sustainability and broad impact are difficult to estimate. Save the Children has tried to accomplish more analytic evaluation by commissioning its own evaluation of its multi-year project in Mozambique and working with an independent team from Michigan State University (MSU). These studies and others have concluded, ‚Äúevidence that the use of food aid, and, specifically, effective programming of the revenues from monetization, can support expanded food availability and other beneficial outcomes.‚Äù =Development of markets and stabilization of prices= Barrett and Maxwell state in Food Aid After Fifty Years:Recasting its Role, \\"that monetization can be done in such a way as to encourage local market development by promoting private sector development.\\" They provide the example of selling food through small traders and processors based in villages to help stimulate competitive distribution channels. Operation Flood in India is a specific example cited to illustrate monetization of food aid developing a market. The European Community via WFP provided skimmed milk powder and butter to fund the first phase of the project. Eventually the project, which targeted linking milksheds with markets in cities, created a self-sustaining system of 43,000 village cooperatives and connected 136 milksheds to 290 markets. Thus, monetization promoted market development \\"through enhanced value-added in upstream production, processing and direct marketing by smallholder producers, increasing their share of the profits from retail milk sales in India.\\" Criticisms The production and shipment of in-kind food aid is often more costly than other methods of providing food assistance, and persistent provision of food aid can create a dependency of the recipient country on food aid. Monetization is controversial in the international community; according to critics, ‚Äúin addition to being highly inefficient, monetization has also proven harmful to regional markets and poor farmers in recipient countries and sometimes to U.S. producers.\\" The GAO has stated, ‚Äúthe current practice of using food aid to generate cash for development projects‚Äîmonetization‚Äîis an inherently inefficient use of resources.‚Äù While many private voluntary organizations support monetization of food aid because it funds their programs, some have begun to fall on the other side. CARE ended its open- market monetization in 2009. TechnoServe announced in 2003 that it would not enter into new Food for Peace contracts because it was an unreliable source of funding. Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, CARE, and other aid groups signed a 2006 declaration stating monetization is inefficient and diverts food from the poor. Catholic Relief Services states it, ‚Äúsells commodities only when it has determined that there are no alternative methods of funding and that the sale of the commodities will have no negative impacts on local markets and local production. CRS will seek to replace monetization with cash funding to cover program costs.‚Äù In 2007, CARE announced it would phase out all monetized food aid by 2009, choosing to forgo the $46 million in food aid it received from the United States government. CARE made the declaration in the International Herald Tribute. CARE‚Äôs 2006 White Paper on food Policy‚Äô‚Äô finds three problems with monetization of food aid: :1. Experience has shown that monetization requires intensive management and is fraught with risks. Procurement, shipping, commodity management, and commercial transactions are management intensive and costly. Experience has shown that these transactions are also fraught with legal and financial risks. :2. Monetization is economically inefficient. Purchasing food in the US, shipping it overseas, and then selling it to generate funds for food security programs is far less cost-effective than the logical alternative ‚Äì simply providing cash to fund food security programs. :3. When monetization involves open-market sale of commodities to generate cash, which is almost always the case, it inevitably causes commercial displacement. It can therefore be harmful to traders and local farmers, and can undermine the development of local markets, which is detrimental to longer-term food security objectives. Many NGOs indicate monetization is an inconvenience at best and can take resources and focus away from their development goals, as they have to hire personnel with expertise in ‚Äúcommodity marketing, commercial contracting, finance, and logistics‚Äù to handle monetization. When NGOs fail to handle food aid with expertise, local traders have complained, ‚Äúabout the adverse effects on the commercial marketing channel of inept competition.‚Äù Although NGO practices have improved over the years, they have often sold commodities below market prices, which undersells local traders and adversely affects the market. Moreover, funds generated from monetization are often unpredictable as they depend on market prices, and this fluctuation in funding can affect NGOs‚Äô programming. Also, monetization often recovers a fraction of the worth of the food commodities, leading to complaints about efficiency. However, not all NGOs agree. The Alliance for Global Food Security represents 13 NGOs, including World Vision, which support the monetization of food aid. The organization states in its Positions on the 2007 Farm Bill that monetization, \\"keeps precious hard currency in the [recipient] country\\" and \\"allows food distributors and processors who do not have the credit status or liquidity to buy on the world market to bid on commodities.\\" Additionally, they say, \\"it has the additional benefits of using the proceeds for programs that improve food security and help the needy.\\" World Vision's website addresses concerns about effects of monetization, stating, \\"Monetization affects local markets, as does every other form of aid. Well-targeted and managed monetization can improve market diversity, performance, transparency and competition; it can overcome local oligopoly control; it can set precedents for publicly visible fair bidding procedures; it can make retail prices more affordable for people living in poverty to buy food. In many circumstances, monetization can comprise an extremely efficient way to address a food deficit.\\" References International relations Aid United States foreign aid ","title":"Monetization of U.S. in-kind food aid"},{"id":"31291009","text":"TUSM may refer to: *Temple University School of Medicine, in the United States *Tufts University School of Medicine, in the United States *Shanghai Tongji University School of Medicine, in Shanghi, China *SC-89 (TUSM), a surface mount device manufactured by Renesas Electronics ","title":"TUSM"},{"id":"31291013","text":"Everything Goes Cold is an industrial band from California.

He was President of the St. Louis Brewing Company and Director of the St. Louis and Suburban Company. He is best known for the Wainwright Building in downtown St. Louis, which was one of the first skyscrapers in the world and one of the most important office buildings of the period. Biography Wainwright was born on August 3, 1850, and although the family hailed from Godfrey, Illinois, he grew up in nearby St. Louis, where he also spent much of his adult life. The son of a prominent brewer and building contractor, an English immigrant named Samuel and Catherine Dorothy, Wainwright was an important figure in railway development in the region. In 1889, he consolidated his father's Wainwright Brewery Company (in which Samuel Wainwright had successfully doubled the profits) with a brewing syndicate and established the St. Louis Brewing Association. Wainwright Building Wainwright visited Europe in the summer of 1890. Meanwhile his plans for the Wainwright Building, named in his honor, and designed by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan were put into effect. It was to be built on the corner of Seventh and Chestnut streets in downtown St. Louis on a plot of land which had been purchased by his mother Catherine. On November 7, 1890, a drawing by Charles K. Ramsey of how the building would look appeared in the Globe-Democrat. It was a nine- or ten-storey red- terracotta cuboid structure, being 114 feet by 127 feet, and held 225 offices when completed in 1892. On November 11, 1890, Sullivan received planning permission to build the office building which would cost over ¬£500,000 (US$ in dollars). The building was among the first skyscrapers in the world and is described as \\"a highly influential prototype of the modern office building\\" by the National Register of Historic Places. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright called the Wainwright Building \\"the very first human expression of a tall steel office-building as Architecture.\\" Before the building was completed, Wainwright's wife Charlotte died of peritonitis, aged just 34. Wainwright commissioned Louis Sullivan to erect the great Wainwright Tomb for her within the Bellefontaine Cemetery, in which his parents and he would also later be buried. In 1902, Wainwright was indicted for conspiracy to bribe members of the state legislature in the Suburban Railway boodle scandal and subsequently became a fugitive in Paris. He was said to have co-signed a $75,000 bank loan for the bribe money. In 1904, his name appeared in The Shame of the Cities, a muckraking expos√© by Lincoln Steffens which gave details of Wainwright's shady dealings and other public corruption within the United States. Death Wainwright Tomb After over 20 years in Paris, with health failing, Wainwright returned to St. Louis and died on November 6, 1924 in his suite in the Buckingham Hotel in St. Louis of a stroke, caused by the deterioration (hardening) of his arteries. He is buried in the Louis Sullivan-designed Wainwright Tomb in Bellefontaine Cemetery, commissioned by Wainwright after the death of his wife; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 1970 and became a St. Louis Landmark in 1971. Like several other grand tombs within the cemetery, the tomb has been described as \\"over- the-top\\" and either \\"reflecting the atmosphere of the times\\", or revealing that \\"ego prevails regardless of the time frame\\" and that \\"wealthy businessmen and families attempted to remain as large in death as they were in life\\". The tomb is a domed cubic building with walls of concrete covered in limestone on the exterior. On the northeast (front) side of the tomb is the entrance with a double-leafed bronze grill and double-doors. The sides of the tomb each have windows, also covered in bronze grills. The interior of the tomb has two burial slabs and a mosaic floor and ceiling. The Wainwright Tomb has been described as \\"the most sensitive and the most graceful of Sullivan's tombs\\" and as \\"one of Sullivan's masterpieces.\\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. After Wainwright's death, an endowment was established that provided for the reconstruction or renovation of the tomb in case of earthquake or vandalism.

As long as the lattice spacing is smaller than a wavelength, these substances can refract and diffract electromagnetic waves, and are used to make lenses, diffraction gratings, mirrors, and polarizers for microwaves. These were first conceptualized, constructed and deployed for interaction in the microwave frequency range in the 1940s and 1950s. The constructed medium, the artificial dielectric, has an effective permittivity and effective permeability, as intended. First published in 2004 according to the CRC Press web page for this book. According to the copyright page of this book, accessible via Google Books, it had gone into its tenth printing by sometime in 2005. In addition, some artificial dielectrics may consist of irregular lattices, random mixtures, or a non-uniform concentration of particles. Artificial dielectrics came into use with the radar microwave technologies developed between the 1940s and 1970s. The term \\"artificial dielectrics\\" came into use because these are macroscopic analogues of naturally occurring dielectrics. The difference between the natural and artificial substance is that the atoms or molecules are artificially (human) constructed materials. Artificial dielectrics were proposed because of the need for lightweight structures and components for various microwave delivery devices. Artificial dielectrics are a direct historical link to metamaterials. Seminal work The term artificial dielectric was originated by Winston E. Kock in 1948 when he was employed by Bell Laboratories. It described materials of practical dimensions that imitated the electromagnetic response of natural dielectric solids. The artificial dielectrics were borne out of a need for lightweight low loss materials for large and otherwise heavy devices. Dielectric analog A three-dimensional lattice filled with two molecules A and B, here shown as black and white spheres. Natural dielectrics, or natural materials, are a model for artificial dielectrics. When an electromagnetic field is applied to a natural dielectric, local responses and scattering occur on the atomic or molecular level. The macroscopic response of the material is then described as electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. However, for this macroscopic response to be valid a type of spatial ordering must be present between the scatterers. In addition, a certain relation to the wavelength is part of its description. A lattice structure, with some degree of spatial ordering is present. Also, the applied field is longer in wavelength than the lattice spacing. This then allows for a macroscopic description expressed as electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. In order to manufacture an artificial permittivity and permeability there must be a capability to access the atoms themselves. This degree of precision is impractical. However, in the late 1940s - in the domain of long wavelengths such as radio frequencies and microwave - it became possible to manufacture larger scale, and more accessible scatterers that mimic the local response of natural materials - along with a synthesized macroscopic response. In the radio frequency and microwave regions such artificial crystal lattice structures were assembled. The scatters responded to an electromagnetic field like atoms and molecules in natural materials, and the media behaved much like dielectrics with an effective media response. The scattering elements are designed to scatter the electromagnetic field in a prescribed manner. The geometric shape of the elements ‚Äì spheres, disks, conducting strips, etc. ‚Äì contribute to the design parameters. Copyright held by the Institute of Electrical Engineers.

He sometimes worked as a writer and signed using his initials, LIM. In English he has sometimes been called a \\"Baron\\" although his rank of Edler meant \\"nobleman\\" and has no exact equivalent; perhaps the nearest translation is \\"Esquire\\". After the Second World War, Mildenstein continued to live in West Germany, where he joined the Free Democratic Party and was elected to its Press Committee. In 1956, he went to Egypt to work for a radio station, and after the capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 he claimed immunity as an intelligence agent of the US Central Intelligence Agency, a claim which was neither confirmed nor denied. Nothing was heard of him after 1964, when he published a book on cocktails. Life Born in 1902 in Prague, then part of Austria-Hungary, Mildenstein belonged to the lowest tier of the Austrian nobility and was brought up as a Roman Catholic. He trained as an engineer and joined the Nazi Party in 1929, receiving the membership number 106,678. In 1932 he joined the SS, becoming one of the first Austrians to do so. According to Dieter Wisliceny, his former SS colleague, Mildenstein visited the Middle East, including British- administered Palestine, several times until 1935.Jacob Boas, \\"A Nazi Travels to Palestine\\" in History Today, Vol. 30, Issue 1 (1980), pp. 33-38 Pascal Bruckner, Steven Rendall, The Tyranny of Guilt: An Essay on Western Masochism (2010), p. 68 On 30 January 1933 Adolf Hitler came to power as Chancellor of Germany. Mildenstein had taken an early interest in Zionism, even going so far as to attend Zionist conferences to help deepen his understanding of the movement. He actively promoted Zionism as a way out of the official impasse on the Jewish question: as a way of making Germany Judenrein (free of Jews). Some Zionists, whose movement had grown tremendously in popularity among German Jews since Hitler came to power, co-operated. On 7 April 1933, the Juedische Rundschau, the bi-weekly paper of the Zionist movement, declared that of all Jewish groups only the Zionist Federation of Germany was capable of approaching the Nazis in good faith as \\"honest partners\\".Jacob Boas, The Jews of Germany: Self-Perception in the Nazi Era as Reflected in the German Jewish Press 1933-1938, Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Riverside, (1977), p. 111 The Federation then commissioned Kurt Tuchler to make contact with possible Zionist sympathisers within the Nazi Party, with the aim of facilitating emigration to Palestine, and Tuchler approached Mildenstein, who was asked to write something positive about Jewish Palestine in the press. Mildenstein agreed, on condition that he be allowed to visit the country in person, with Tuchler as his guide. So, in the spring of 1933 a party of four set out from Berlin, consisting of Mildenstein, Tuchler, and their wives. They spent a month together in Palestine,Yad Vashem studies, Vol. 37, part 1, p. 134 and Mildenstein began to write a series of articles for Der Angriff, a Nazi Party newspaper in Berlin, founded by Joseph Goebbels in 1927. Mildenstein himself remained in Palestine for a total of six months before his return to Germany as an enthusiast for Zionism, and even began to study Hebrew.Lenni Brenner, Zionism in the Age of the Dictators (1983), online edition at marxists.de, accessed 27 March 2011 In August 1933 Hitler's government and German Zionists entered into the Haavara Agreement, which encouraged emigration by allowing Jews to transfer property and funds from Germany to Palestine. On his return to Berlin, Mildenstein's suggestion that the solution to the Jewish problem lay in mass migration to Palestine was accepted by his superiors within the SS. From August 1934 to June 1936 Mildenstein worked in the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the security service of the SS, in Section II/112, in charge of the Jewish Desk, with the title of Judenreferent (Jewish Affairs Officer). This title meant that he was responsible for reporting on \\"Jewish Affairs\\" under the overall command of Reinhard Heydrich.Max Williams, Reinhard Heydrich: The Biography: Volume 1 (2001), p 61. During those years, Mildenstein favoured a policy of encouraging Germany's Jewish population to emigrate to Palestine, and in pursuit of this policy he developed positive contacts with Zionist organizations. SS officials were even instructed to encourage the activities of the Zionists within the Jewish community, who were to be favoured over the assimilationists, said to be the real danger to Nazism. Even the anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws of September 1935 had a special Zionist provision, allowing the Jews to fly their own flag. Adolf Eichmann, later one of the most significant organizers of the Holocaust, believed that his big break came in 1934, when he had a meeting with Mildenstein, a fellow-Austrian, in the Wilhelmstrasse and was invited to join Mildenstein's department.Anna Porter, Kasztner's Train: The True Story of an Unknown Hero of the Holocaust (2008), p. 94: \\"His first big break, as he saw it later, presented itself in 1934, when he was told to report to Second Lieutenant Leopold von Mildenstein at 102 Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. Von Mildenstein ran the SD \\"Jews Section,\\" or Section II/112. A fellow Austrian with an easy manner, von Mildenstein took an interest in teaching Eichmann the basics of his department.\\"Peter Padfield, Himmler: Reichsf√ºhrer- SS, Cassel & Co, London, (2001) [1990], p. 198 Eichmann later stated that Mildenstein rejected the vulgar anti-semitism of Streicher. Soon after his arrival in the section Mildenstein gave Eichmann a book on Judaism by Adolf Boehm, a leading Jew from Vienna.Serge Klarsfeld, Joseph Billig, Georges Wellers, The Holocaust and the Neo-Nazi Mythomania (1978), p. 12 Between 9 September and 9 October 1934 the Nazi Party newspaper Der Angriff published a series of twelve quite pro-Zionist reports, titled A Nazi Goes to Palestine, by Mildenstein, to which honour, the newspaper issued a commemorative medallion, cast with the swastika on one side and the Star of David on the other. In the summer of 1935, then holding the rank of SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer, Mildenstein attended the 19th Congress of the Zionist Organization in Lucerne, Switzerland, as an observer attached to the German Jewish delegation.Francis R. Nicosia, The Third Reich & the Palestine Question (2000), p. 61 Mildenstein's apparently pro-Zionist line was overtaken by events, and after a dispute with Reinhard Heydrich in 1936 he was removed from his post and transferred to the Foreign Ministry's press department. He had fallen out of favour because migration to Palestine was not proceeding at a fast enough rate. His departure from the SD also saw a shift in SS policy, marked by the publication of a pamphlet warning of the dangers of a strong Jewish state in the Middle East, written by another \\"expert\\" on Jewish matters who had been invited to join Section II/112 by Mildenstein himself, Eichmann.Peter Padfield, Himmler: Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (2001) [1990], pp. 198, 199, 275 Mildenstein was replaced as the head of his former section by Kuno Schroeder.Yaacov Lozowick, Hitler's Bureaucrats: the Nazi Security Police and the Banality of Evil (2005), p. 20 Later in December 1939, Eichmann was made chief of the Jewish Department Referat IV B4 of the RSHA, which the SD became a part in September, 1939.Peter Padfield, Himmler: Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (2001) [1990], p. 334Adrian Weale, Army of Evil: A History of the SS (2012), pp. 140-144 As Germany moved into the Second World War, Mildenstein continued to write propaganda articles and books. After the war, his \\"Around the Burning Land of the Jordan\\" (1938)Stollberg, Berlin, 1938 and \\"The Middle East Seen from the Roadside\\" (1941)Union, Stuttgart, 1941 were placed on the list of proscribed literature in the Soviet occupation zone and later in the German Democratic Republic. Like the Haavara Agreement, Mildenstein's visit to Palestine in 1933, the medal to commemorate it, and the pro-Zionist articles in the Nazi newspaper Der Angriff, were evidence of actual relations between Nazism and Zionism during the mid-1930s. =Post-war= Mildenstein visited the United States in 1954, having been granted a visa to do so at the request of the government of West Germany. In January 1956, he asked the U. S. Embassy in Bonn to help him obtain an exchange grant for journalists, although he was not one. By then a member of the Free Democratic Party, in May 1956 he was elected to its Press Committee. In December 1956, a CIA report from Cairo confirmed that he had been employed by the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdul Nasser to work for its Voice of the Arabs radio station. In June 1960, soon after the capture of Eichmann by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960, Mildenstein announced that he had had an operational relationship with the CIA and as a former U. S. intelligence agent claimed immunity from prosecution. This relationship was neither confirmed nor denied by the CIA.Richard Breitman, U. S. Intelligence and the Nazis, pp. 342-343 In 1964, Mildenstein published a new book on the mixing of cocktails, including some non-alcoholic ones,Mix mit und ohne Alkohol (Munich: Copress-Verlag, 1964, 93 pp., illustrated by Walter Tafelmaier), reviewed in Libreria svizzera, Volume 22 (1964), p. 700: \\"Leopold von Mildenstein: MIX MIT UND OHNE ALKOHOL, 96 Seiten mit vielen farbigen Illustrationen Mehrfarbiger animierter Einband.\\" but after that no more was heard of him until he died in November 1968.K[arl] S[eeger]: \\"Dipl[om]-Ing[enieur] Leopold Itz Edler von Mildenstein ‚Ä†\\" in Sportjournalist Jg. 18 (1968), H. 11, page 16 In 2011, the Israeli director Arnon Goldfinger, a grandson of Mildenstein's companions the Tuchlers, produced a film called The Flat,Eyelet Dekel, The Flat by Arnon Goldfinger at midnighteast.com in which Mildenstein's friendship with his grandparents is discussed at length. Goldfinger's film showed that his grandparents had kept in touch with the Mildensteins after the war. He interviewed Mildenstein's daughter, Edda, and details of Mildenstein's life are revealed in the film. Looking into the German National Archives, Goldfinger states that Mildenstein joined the Ministry of Propaganda under Goebbels in 1938 and that he later worked as a press officer for Coca-Cola in West Germany until the public Eichmann hearings of 1961, in which Eichmann named him as \\"the specialist in Jewish affairs.\\"Something Greater Than Your Own Story, Interview with Goldfinger by Jan Oltmanns, at remembering.today, accessed 8 May 2018 See also * Glossary of Nazi Germany * List of Nazi Party leaders and officials * List of SS personnel References *Jacob Boas, 'A Nazi Travels to Palestine', in History Today, vol. 30, issue 1, pp. 33‚Äì38 *Magnus Brechtken: 'Madagaskar f√ºr die Juden: Antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1883-1945' (\\"Madagascar for the Jews: anti-Semitic ideas and political practice, 1883-1945\\") (Munich, 1998), p. 171 onwards *Saul Friedl√§nder, Das Dritte Reich und die Juden (\\"The Third Reich and the Jews\\") (Bonn, 2006), p. 77 *Tom Segev, The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust (New York: Owl Books, 1994; German edition, Hamburg, 1995) *H.

Gameplay The NES version of Super Dodge Ball expands upon the basic premise of the original arcade version by giving the members of each team individual names and stats. Moreover, in addition to the single-player tournament mode and a 2-player versus mode, there's also a free- for-all \\"bean ball\\" mode where the six members of Team USA fight each other until one remains. The objective of each match is to defeat the rival team by throwing a dodge ball at its members. Each character has a life gauge that is gradually depleted as he gets struck by dodge balls. When their life reaches zero, they will be eliminated. When a character gets hit, with a life gauge of three bars or lower, they will be placed in a \\"tired\\" state, giving the opponent a moment of advantage. Moreover, each has their own stats and two different power shots (one which is performed while running, and another that is performed during a running jump). =World Cup play= World Cup play is the game's single-player mode. The player takes control of Team USA, as they compete against eight rival teams in a dodgeball tournament with irregular rules. To win each match, the player must defeat the three infield members of the rival team. However, if the three infield members of the player's team are defeated, the player will lose the match. Like in the arcade version, the player starts off in a match against another rival American team and then proceed to face against seven international teams. The eighth match is against Team USSR. If the player loses at least one of their members during the match with USSR, the game will end after USSR is defeated. However, if all three infield members are still alive, an additional match set in Team USSR's home court will be held against Team Shadow, a clone of Team USA whose members will be arranged in the same positions as the player's. The home courts of Team Iceland's and Team Kenya's are different from those of the other teams. Iceland's court is a slippery field of ice, whereas Kenya's court is a swampland that makes it hard to run. =Versus play= Versus play is the 2-player competitive mode. Both players can choose from any of the nine teams from the World Cup mode, including the same team as the other player. While both players can change the formation of their teams before each match, there's only one fixed court in this mode. The rules in each match are the same as in World Cup play. =Bean ball= Bean ball mode is a free-for-all mode that can be played by one or two players. The player can choose from one of the six members of Team USA. The members who are not chosen by the player (or players) will be controlled by the computer instead. In this mode, each member of Team USA must fight each other on a schoolyard until only one remains. Unlike the courts of the other game modes, there is no infield or outfield and all six characters can move in any place they want. The background of the schoolyard changes depending on the difficulty setting: on Easy, it is set during the day; on Normal, it is evening; and on Difficult, it is nighttime. Teams ;Team USA :The team controlled by the player in World Cup play, as well as bean ball mode. Led by Sam Powers. The other members include John Stone, Mike Knopfler, Randy Sting, Bill Flash, and Steve Sato. ;Team Pro All-Stars :The other American team, led by Jack, who is its most powerful member and holds the ball most of the time. Although their physical strength are low, they have good defense and can intercept many shots. Their stage is set atop a building with the Statue of Liberty on the background. ;Team England :Led by James. A team with good shooting technique. Although they have high stamina, they become weak when stricken and their agility is not very high either. Their stage is set near the banks of River Thames with Tower Bridge on the background. Their theme music is loosely and mostly based on the song \\"Get Back\\" by the Beatles, with references to \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" ;Team India :Led by Rajiv. A team with low stamina, but unusually strong shots and extremely high resistance. They have no firm strategy and while they pass the ball to outfield members often, it is easier to steal their passes compared to other teams such as China. One of their players, Swami, is the most-resilient character in the game, as a super shot only causes him to lose 2 points of health. Their stage is set in front of Taj Mahal. ;Team Iceland :Led by Helgi. While their stamina and ball power are high, their speed is slow. They're a team that relies on individual power play. They very rarely pass the ball to each other or crouch to avoid shots. Their stage is a field of ice with nobody but penguins on the background. ;Team China :A team with low defense, but good catching technique. They attempt to distract the players by making good use of jumping passes to outfield teammates, as well as Captain Wang's power shot \\"The Breaker\\". Their stage is set on Tiananmen Square. ;Team Kenya :Led by Yemi. They possess great speed and a wild agility. Their offensive and defensive strategies consist of using many dashes and jumps. They always shoot immediately when they possess the ball and rarely pass it to each other, and they'll try to steal the ball if the player is passing it to an outfield teammate. Their stage is set on an outdoor swampland at sunset. ;Team Japan :A team with great offense and leadership. Their captain Fuji always collects the ball and has powerful shots. Fuji is placed on the end row of the defensive side. However, its leadership falls apart when Fuji is eliminated. Their stage has Mount Fuji and a few cherry blossom trees on the background. Their theme music is based on \\"Sakura Sakura\\". ;Team USSR :An all-around team with a balance in offense and defense, led by Boris. Their stage is set in front of Red Square. Their theme music is based on \\"Katyusha\\". ;Team Shadow :A clone of Team USA, although their sprites are colored white-and-grey. They appear in the game after the match with Team USSR if the player wins the match with all of its members. Although they have the same formation and physical strength as the player's team during their match with USSR, the rest of their abilities are greater. The player's position cannot be changed before the match with Team Shadow. Their playing pattern is based on any of the eight previous CPU teams. Regional differences Like its arcade counterpart, the nationalities of the Japanese and American teams were switched between the two versions of the game. In the Famicom version, Team USA and Team Pro All-Stars were originally Nekketsu High School and Hanazono High School respectively, both Japanese teams. Team USSR is the penultimate team in the Famicom version and whereas their captain's sprite is unchanged, their stats are identical to Team Japan in the NES version. On the other hand, Team USA is the final rival team in the Famicom version and while their captain has the same design as Team Japan's captain in the NES version, their stats are the same as Team USSR's in the NES version. Nekketsu K≈çk≈ç Dodgeball Bu was notably the first Famicom game to allow up to four players to participate simultaneously. The two additional players can participate in Bean Ball mode by plugging another controller or a multi-controller adapter such as HAL's Joypair and Hori's Twin Adapter into the console's expansion port. Since the NES Four Score and NES Satellite were not released yet when the game was made, the NES version only allows up to two players. When the player resets the game in the Famicom version, a voice clip of Kunio saying his catch-phrase will be played.

It is chemically a 1-substituted-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine derivative, which is structurally unrelated to most other opioid drugs. Racemic MT-45 has around 80% the potency of morphine, with almost all opioid activity residing in the (S) enantiomer (the opposite stereochemistry from the related drug lefetamine). It has been used as a lead compound from which a large family of potent opioid drugsUS Patent 4080453 have been developed, including full agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists at the three main opioid receptor subtypes. Recreational use of MT-45 has been associated with hearing loss and unconsciousness. MT-45 became a class A drug in the UK on 11 March 2015 MT-45 is banned in the Czech Republic. The Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was amended in 2016 to include the substance as a Schedule I substance. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 7 years imprisonment. Further, Health Canada amended the Food and Drug Regulations in May, 2016 to classify MT-45 as a restricted drug.Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Parts G and J ‚Äî Lefetamine, AH-7921, MT-45 and W-18) Only those with a law enforcement agency, person with an exemption permit or institutions with Minister's authorization may possess the drug in Canada.

Its purpose was to boost the defenses of Fort Leavenworth in case Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Sterling Price attempted to overrun the area. Price spent all of September and most of October in Missouri on an expedition to occupy that state (see Price's Raid). Since Fort Sully was part of an existing fort, it was technically termed a battery instead of a fort. It was named for Gen. Alfred Sully, who was stationed at Fort Leavenworth at the outbreak of the Civil War but transferred soon after.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Historical Marker located at Fort Leavenworth, KS Gen. Thomas Alfred Davies was put in charge of defending Fort Leavenworth. Maj. Franklin E. Hunt was placed in command of the defense of the city of Leavenworth, Kansas. Several earthwork batteries were established overlooking the city of Leavenworth from along the southwestern edge of Fort Leavenworth, as well as in the city of Leavenworth along Michigan Avenue. LaMaster, p. 49; Images of America Fort Leavenworth (Arcadia Publishing, 2010). Once completed, Fort Sully was a formidable battery. Its occupants and guns could concentrate on any location in the surrounding area. The battery had numerous fortified areas where men, cannons and mortars could be placed. These were not only on the plateau but also along the steep sides of Hancock Hill. The plateau was in the shape of a foot's sole, the widest part being the northern third, which was 100 feet across. The south two-thirds of the plateau ranged from 25 to 75 feet wide. The plateau was approximately 670 feet long from north to south.Barr and Rowlinson, p. 337; map of Fort Sully (Kansas City: Kansas City District Corps of Engineers, Engineering Div., Survey Section, August 1993). Many M1819, 24-pounder siege guns were dragged up the steep hill from the armory at Fort Leavenworth and became the main armament of Fort Sully. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Historical Marker located at Fort Leavenworth, KS It is not known how many troops were stationed at Fort Sully, but it seems throughout its existence, at least some troops were always there. The threat to Fort Leavenworth was eliminated with Price's defeat at Westport, Missouri, on October 23, 1864.Map of Fort Sully; Allie interview. By June 1865 only four men were assigned to Fort Sully. The use of the battery had ended. That month plans were made to take everything from Fort Sully that could be put to use elsewhere at Fort Leavenworth. Since access to the site has always been restricted, the Fort Sully site has remained well preserved to this day.Brig. Gen. Robert B. Mitchell, report, The War of the Rebellion (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1896), Series I, Vol. XLVIII, Part II, p. 886. Today, all that remains of Fort Sully is the crater- like imprint of the earthwork construction. The ruins of the fort can be reached on foot or via horseback by accessing the powerline clearing located behind Stanley Avenue and Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery on Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. On the wooded side of the clearing, a sign indicating the direction of the Heritage Trail can be found. This trail leads to the ruins of the fort. Several historical markers dedicated to the memory of Fort Sully are located around Fort Leavenworth, including at the actual site of Fort Sully, in Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery just below Fort Sully, and at the entrance to the Frontier Military Museum along with two of the M1819, 24-pounder siege guns which were actually emplaced at Fort Sully.

An example of his close connection with the Crown appears in the account of the delivery of the royal seal of King Edward I by his son Edward to the Lord Chancellor, John de Langeton, which took place at Tonbridge Castle, Kent on 27 August 1297, with Sir Guncelin de Badlesmere being one of the witnesses.Calendar of the Fine Rolls, Vol. 1 Edward I, pp. 390‚Äì391. Gunselin was evidently still alive on 22 March 1299/1300, when Walter de Gloucester, as \\"escheator this side the Trent\\", was instructed to investigate allegations that Guncelm had damaged property belonging to the estate of Edward, son and heir of Philip Burnel, a minor whom the King had committed into Guncelin's custody.Calendar of the Close Rolls Edward I, Vol 4, p.339. On 13 April 1301, a writ was issued to initiate enquiries into the identity of the next heir of lands that had been held directly from the King by Guncelin de Badlesmere. Presumably, he had died shortly before that date. An inquisition post mortem held on 30 April of that year in respect of land he held in Kent at Badlesmere and Donewelleshethe confirmed that the next heir was his son Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere (12751322).Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 4, No. 38. By 4 October 1302, it was established that the damage to Edward Burnel's inheritance had taken place before Gunselin became involved. Therefore, the lands concerned were to be delivered to the executors of Gunselin's will.Calendar of the Close Rolls Edward I, Vol 4, p.558. He died in the 29th year of the reign of Edward I (in 1301), and was buried in Badlesmere church, where in 1800 it was reported that his wooden cross-legged effigy could still be found.

Design and development  The S-5 was powered by a Argus water-cooled engine turning a propeller Sikorsky designed and built himself. The fabric covering the wooden wings was tightened with pure alcohol and glue mixed with boiling water. The fuselage structure was left exposed. Instead of separate levers to control the elevator and ailerons as in his previous aircraft, Sikorsky designed a single control lever with a wheel allowing control of pitch and roll. This \\"control column\\" included a button switch to momentarily deactivate the ignition thereby controlling engine power. The rudder controls were reversed, because it better suited Sikorsky's tactility of the machine. Operational history The S-5 was tested in a series of 20 to 30-second straight-line flights, over a period of three weeks, before the designer was able to make what he called his first real flight of four minutes, in a circuit of the field, on 17 May 1911. After outperforming Russian Army aircraft during manoeuvres watched by Czar Nicholas II in September, the S-5 earned Igor Sikorsky his first income with a series of exhibition flights during a country fair at Belaya Tzerkov, near Kiev. Between nine and ten flying hours were logged before the S-5 was lost in late fall. The crash was caused by fuel starvation due to debris (a mosquito) blocking the carburetor jet.
