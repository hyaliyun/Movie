It provided general and vocational education for young gentlemen of sixteen to eighteen years old, who were nominated by the Company's directors to writerships in its overseas civil service. It closed in 1858. The college buildings survive and are now occupied by Haileybury and Imperial Service College. The college's counterpart for the training of officers for the company's Presidency armies was Addiscombe Military Seminary, Surrey. History Charles Grant, Chairman of the British East India Company and Member of Parliament, was closely involved in the foundation of the college. It was first located in Hertford Castle but it was evident that a purpose-built seat of learning would be more suitable and in October 1805 the company purchased an estate just outside Hertford Heath for the sum of ¬£5,930 for this objective. The foundation stone of the new buildings were laid on 12 May 1806. The buildings cost the East India Company ¬£92,000 at the time of their erection to the designs of the architect William Wilkins (who later designed the National Gallery in London). The grounds were landscaped by Humphry Repton, his most notable work here being the terraced area to the front of Wilkins' main range and ponds to the west of this. Repton submitted his final account for work undertaken here just eight days before a carriage accident which left him crippled. The new buildings were occupied by students in 1809.Danvers et al. 1894, p. 18. The East India Company had been incorporated in 1600 as a commercial entity. For two hundred years its administrators had been recruited, largely by patronage, to oversee commercial transactions in Asia. By 1800 they had become the de facto government for millions of people in those areas, but without much training for the role. The college was intended to address these shortcomings. In fifty years it trained over two thousand so-called \\"writers\\" to administer the Indian subcontinent. The curriculum was wide, detailed, and targeted to the career responsibilities. It included political economy, history, mathematics, natural philosophy, classics, law and humanity and philology. Languages included Arabic, Urdu (Hindustani), Bengali, Marathi, Sanskrit, Telugu and Persian. Among the tutors were some of the finest minds of the day, many from Oxford and Cambridge, with lavish annual salaries as much as ¬£500. The college was customarily referred to as \\"Haileybury\\" in contemporary accounts, debates in the House of Lords and the House of Commons and by the administrators of the East India Company and the Colonial Civil Service. From 1839 the College had a journal known as the Haileybury Observer. The East India Company itself was seen as too powerful. There was pressure for meritocracy to replace recruitment by patronage. Graduates of universities in Great Britain should have the chance to serve in India, without needing to pass through the college. In 1855, Parliament passed an act \\"to relieve the East India Company from the obligation to maintain the College at Haileybury\\". King's College, London, hosted the first open competitive examinations for appointment to the Indian Civil Service. Closure and later use of buildings In the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, and in anticipation of the winding-up of the affairs of the East India Company itself, the college was closed in January 1858. This left the puzzle of what to do with the imposing buildings. For a brief period, they became a military depot for troops destined for India, and during this interregnum the college's Master, Henry Melvill, and Registrar, the Reverend James William Lucas Heaviside, continued to live in their residences on the site and oversaw the maintenance of the buildings. In 1861, the estate was sold at public auction, when it was bought by the British Land Company for ¬£15,000.Richard Rhodes James, The Road from Mandalay: A Journey in the Shadow of the East (2007), p. 191 A Hertford publisher, Stephen Austin, who had been the official printer to the East India Company‚Äôs College and had thus become one of the leading printers of books in various Oriental languages, led a campaign to ensure the buildings were returned to some sort of academic purpose, and in 1862 the site reopened as the public school Haileybury College. This was formally constituted by a royal charter dated 30 August 1864. During the Victorian era, the difference between the two periods of education on the site was referred to as \\"Old Haileybury\\" and \\"New Haileybury\\". In its early years, the new Haileybury College retained close links to those involved in colonial administration, and in 1942 it merged with the struggling Imperial Service College to become Haileybury and Imperial Service College.

The archaic term for nobility, fr√§lse, also included the clergy, a classification defined by tax exemptions and representation in the diet (the Riksdag). Today the nobility does not maintain its former privileges although family names, titles and coats of arms are still protected. The Swedish nobility consists of both \\"introduced\\" and \\"unintroduced\\" nobility, where the latter has not been formally \\"introduced\\" at the House of Nobility (Riddarhuset). The House of Nobility still maintains a fee for male members over the age of 18 for upkeep on pertinent buildings in Stockholm. Belonging to the nobility in present-day Sweden may still carry some informal social privileges, and be of certain social and historical significance particularly among some groups. Sweden has, however, long been a modern democratic society and meritocratic practices are supposed to govern all appointments to state offices by law. No special privileges, in taxation or otherwise, are therefore given to any Swedish citizen based on family origins, the one exception being the Royal family and the position as head of state held by the monarch of Sweden. However, also this role is today, according to the instrument of government, ceremonial. In 1902 Sven Hedin became the last person to be ennobled in Sweden. From 1974 the monarch can not confer nobility. As of 2004 there were about 619 existing noble families in Sweden, with about 28,000 members. They are classified as counts (46 families), barons (124 families) and untitled nobility (449 families).Riddarhuset Until 2003 the nobility was regulated by a government statute, but in that year the statute was lifted so that governmental sanction and legal regulation of the nobility was discontinued. The House of Nobility is now a private institution, run as any private corporation under civil commercial law, and is owned by its members. Today, the only privilege of the nobility is the right to use a helm with an open visor in their coats of arms, this according to a 1762 royal act; commoners using open visors or \\"noblemen's shield\\" (Adelig Sk√∂ld) are subjected to a fine.Svenska heraldiska f√∂reningen: Adelig sk√∂ld och hj√§lm When an association called Ofr√§lse och l√∂ske m√§ns samfund f√∂r bruk af √∂ppne hj√§lmar (Commoners' and vagabonds' society for the use of open visors) petitioned the Swedish government for amnesty (Swedish: abolition) in regards to violations of the 1762 act, the petition was not tried nor granted. The Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden ruled, in 2013, that, since no one has the right to amnesty, the government's decision did not concern anyone's civil rights according to the European Convention on Human Rights, and could thus not be examined by the court.Sk√∂vde Nyheter: Vapensk√∂ld r√§ttighet bara f√∂r adeln, 2013-05-31Supreme Administrative Court decision 2013-05-20, case no. 4346-12 Organization Swedish nobility is organized into three classes according to a scheme introduced in riddarhusordningen (Standing orders of the House of Knights) 1626 * the Class of Lords (), comprising counts (greve) and barons (friherre, baron), two titles introduced in 1561 by Erik XIV; * the Class of Knights (), untitled descendants of Swedish Privy Councillors and since 1778 the 300 oldest families in the Class of Esquire as well as the \\"commander families\\", who are of the descendants of commanders of Swedish royal orders; * the Class of Esquires (), other untitled nobles. The two last classes contains the so-called untitled nobility (). The division into classes has roots in the Middle Ages when the nobility fr√§lse was divided into lords in the Privy Council, knights and esquires. Until 1719 the three classes voted separately, but in the Age of Liberty all classes were voting together with one vote for each family head (). This made the vast majority of the untitled nobility in power, for example officers and civil servants were represented. In 1778 Gustav III restored the classes and class voting and at the same time he reformed the Class of Knights. Originally this class only contained family descendants of Privy Councillors and was the smallest class of the three classes. But Gustav III also introduced in this class the 300 oldest families in the Class of Esquire and also the \\"commander families\\", who are of the descendants of commanders of the Order of the Northern Star and the Order of the Sword. No more commander families were introduced in the House of Knights after 1809, and thereafter also the class voting was abolished and the nobility was then voting as during the Age of Liberty. A Swedish duke (hertig) has almost always been of royal status and counted as such. An exception in medieval times was Benedict, Duke of Halland. Two men were also created princes (furstar) in the 18th century: Fredrik Vilhelm von Hessenstein and Vilhelm Putbus but neither were introduced. The House of Nobility (Riddarhuset) in Stockholm Following the elevation of a commoner into nobility by the Swedish monarch, the new nobleman had to seek introduction in order to be a fully recognised member of the House of Nobility (Riddarhuset), a term that also refers to its function as a chamber in the Riksdag of the Estates, the Swedish Parliament. In 1866 the Nobility was formally separated from government and incorporated as a separate institution, governed by statutes handed down by the monarch (from 1975: the government). This last link to the government and state was abolished in 2003. The Palace of the Nobility served as official representation for the nobility and was regulated by the Swedish government, but this regulation ceased completely in 2003, as have the privileges. The membership roster is published every three years.  Medieval nobility: Fr√§lse  King Magnus III The institution of Swedish (and Finnish) nobility dates back to 1280, when it was stated by King Magnus III in the Decree of Alsn√∂ that magnates who could afford to contribute a mounted soldier to the cavalry were to be exempted from tax - at least from ordinary taxes - just as the clergy already had been. The archaic Swedish term for nobility, fr√§lse, also included the clergy with respect to their exemption from tax. Generally, the nobility grew from wealthier or more powerful members of the peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen. The background for this was that the old system of a lei√∞angr fleet and a king constantly on travel through the realm (between the estates of Uppsala √∂d) had by this time become outmoded. The crown's court and castles were now to be financed through taxes on land. Soon it was agreed that the king should govern the realm in cooperation with a Privy Council (or Royal Council), in which the bishops and the most distinguished magnates (i.e. the most prominent contributors to the army) participated. When critical decisions were necessary, the whole fr√§lse was summoned to the diets. Swedish nobility had no hereditary fiefs. In the case where a noble was granted a castle belonging to the crown, his heirs couldn't later claim their ancestors' civil or military rights. The lands of the magnates who constituted the medieval nobility were their own and not \\"on lease\\" from a feudal king. If they by their own means or exploitation of peasants built a castle and financed troops, then the castle was theirs, but the troops were expected to serve as a part of the army of the realm. In Sweden, there never existed outright serfdom. Hence, nobility was basically a class of well-off citizens, not owners of other human beings. In the Middle Ages and much of the modern age, nobles and other wealthy men were landowners, as well as lords of villeins and servants. Members of the nobility utilized their economic power and sometimes also other powers to have small-farm owners sell their lands to manor lords, so landowning centralized gradually more in the hands of the noble class. For extended periods, the commander of Viborg at the Novgorod/Russian front did, in practice, function as a margrave, keeping all the crown's income from the fief to use for the defense of the realm's eastern border. But despite heavy German influence during the medieval period, the elaborate German system with titles such as Lantgraf, Reichsgraf, Burggraf and Pfalzgraf was never applied in Sweden.  Ancient nobility  Swedish ancient nobility () is the term used for families whose de facto status as nobility was formalised by the Ordinance of Alsn√∂ in 1280. These noble families have no original patents of nobility, the first known being from 1360.Nordisk Familjebok 1926 http://runeberg.org/nfcr/0604.html The somewhat loose cut-off date or rather rule of thumb for what constitutes ancient Swedish nobility is therefore set to during mid 14th century but no later than 1400. Some Swedish ancient families are still extant at the Swedish House of Nobility or the Finnish House of Nobility; some have been further elevated from Class of Esquires to Class of Knights or to titled nobility (count or baron). In 1778 all ancient noble families in the Class of Esquires were elevated to the Class of Knights. Some ancient noble families: * Aspen√§s * Ban√©r * Bese *Bielke (extant, Sweden's second oldest noble family) *Bj√∂rn *B√•√•t *Bonde (extant) *Carpelan (extant) *Eka *Hiort af Orn√§s (extant) *H√•rd af Segerstad (extant) *J√§gerhorn af Spurila (extant) *Leijonhufvud (extant) *Lillieh√∂√∂k (extant) *Natt och Dag (extant, Sweden's oldest noble family) *Oxenstierna (extant) *Porse *Posse (extant) *Ribbing (extant) *Rosenstr√•le *Sparre (extant) *Stenbock (extant) *Trolle (extant) *√ñrnsparre  Nobility after 1561  Axel Oxenstierna secured all government appointments to be filled by nobles. At the coronation of Eric XIV in 1561, Swedish nobility became formally hereditary for the first time upon the creation of the higher titles of Count (greve) and Baron (friherre). The House of Knights was organized in 1626. The grounds for introduction into this chamber became either birth into an \\"ancient\\" noble family or ennoblement by the sovereign. Consequently, genealogy flourished. The Lord High Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, was the architect of the Instrument of Government of 1634, which laid the foundation of modern Sweden. It guaranteed that all government appointments were to be filled by candidates from the nobility, a move which helped mobilize support for, rather than opposition to, a centralized national government. Due to the many wars fought by Sweden, the crown needed some means of rewarding its officers, and since the royal coffers were not without end, ennoblement and grants of land were useful substitutes for cash payments. During the 17th century, the number of noble families grew by a factor of five. In less than a century, the nobility's share of Swedish land ownership rose from 16% to over 60%, which led to considerably lower tax revenue for the crown. The \\"Reduction\\" of 1655 and 1680, however, brought land back into the crown's possession. Historically all members of a noble family were generally titled. If the family was of the rank of a Count or a Baron, all members received that title as well. However, following the new Instrument of Government from 1809, a change was made more in line with the British system so that, for later nobility, only the head of the family would hold the title (if there is one). There are a few families where these systems overlap such that the vast majority are nobles pre-1809 without title, while the heads of the families have been elevated to count or baron after 1809. The vast majority of noble families are still of the old kind where all members are regarded as nobles. No hereditary title of nobility has been granted since 1902, when explorer Sven Hedin was ennobled by the King (that honor was hereditary, but he left no heirs). Since 1975 the Swedish monarch and government no longer have the right to ennoble or to confer knighthoods and orders on Swedes. Titles are still given to members of the Swedish royal house where princes and princesses are made non-hereditary dukes or duchesses of selected provinces, but these are honorary titles within that house, not titles of nobility. Unintroduced nobility Being \\"introduced\\" at the House of Nobility meant that the body confirmed the status of a family as Swedish nobility. Even when a family was ennobled by the Swedish monarch, it still had to seek introduction at the House of Nobility to achieve such status. Introduction, however, was not necessary for being considered noble, based on other factors (see list below), whereas only the introduced families had a legally privileged position. Unintroduced families still could use their titles, if they had any, and noble elements and styles in their coats of arms. There has never been legislation in Sweden preventing anyone from purporting to belong to nobility. The recognition of such noble status in society was of a social, not a legal, nature, as has all Swedish nobility become since it was separated from the government more recently. Sweden has had a significant number of unintroduced noble families (as of 2010 comprising 99 living families and around 450 individuals), several of which have been historically prominent. The families fall into four groups: #Foreign nobility, being families of foreign origin (particularly German/Baltic, but also other nationalities) which had noble status in a different country than Sweden, and which partially or wholly live in Sweden. This group is the largest. #Families of Swedish origin which were granted noble status and/or titles by a foreign country (for example, members of the royal House of Bernadotte have been granted Belgian and Luxembourgish princely and comital titles). #Families which have been ennobled by the Swedish monarch, but which have not been introduced at the House of Nobility. This group is small. #Armigerous families of foreign origin which have traditionally been included in the various directories of unintroduced nobility, but whose original noble status has not been proven. They are included in Swedish unintroduced nobility for traditional reasons, such as having been considered noble in Sweden for an extended period of time. This group is also small. Three successive almanach series of unintroduced nobility have been published; the first in 1886, the second in 1912, and the third in 1935; it came out most recently in 2010. An association of unintroduced nobility, Sveriges Ointroducerade Adels F√∂rening, private club with no official standing, was founded in 1911. Several branches of the House of Bernadotte have chosen to become members of this association, as a result of members of the royal family being denied the use of Swedish titles upon marrying non-royals, but being granted foreign (Luxembourgish or Belgian) titles. Carl Johan Bernadotte was chairman of the association for many years.

The names of these were usually in Swedish, Latin, German or Greek. The adoption of Latin names was first used by the Catholic clergy in the 15th century. The given name was preceded by Herr (Sir), followed by a Latinized form of patronymic names. Starting from the time of the Reformation, the Latinized form of their birthplace (Laurentius Petri Gothus, from √ñsterg√∂tland) became a common naming practice for the clergy. Later merchants and other social groups discarded the formerly used family names (such as patronymic surnames) and adopted high-sounding Latin surnames. Another subsequent practice was the use of the Greek language with the ending of -ander, the Greek word for man. The use of surnames was still quite uncommon in the 17th century among the nobility and the educated class. Furthermore, the concept of hereditary surnames was also limited to a few families. When a family was ennobled, it was usually given a name‚Äîjust as lordships of England and other Western European countries. This was a period which produced a myriad of two-word Swedish-language family names for the nobility (very favored prefixes were Adler-, \\"eagle\\"; Ehren- \\"√§ra\\", \\"honor\\"; Silfver-, \\"silver\\"; and Gyllen-, \\"golden\\"). The regular difference with Britain was that it became the new surname of the whole house, and the old surname was dropped altogether.  Privileges  The noble estates are not abolished in Sweden, but their privileged position has been weakened step by step since 1680. The nobility's political privileges were practically abolished by the reformation of the Riksdag of the Estates in 1866, and the last rights of precedence to certain governmental offices were removed in the 1920s. By then the last tax exemption privileges had also been abolished. However, some minor privileges remained until 2003, including the right to be beheaded by sword, when the law granting these noble privileges was completely abolished and the government no longer has the right to call the heads of families to be assembled in session. The prerogatives of nobility today are limited to protection of noble titles and certain elements and styles used in their coats of arms (this according to a 1762 act): a helm with an open visor, a coronet showing rank, a medallion and the use of supporters. Modern Swedish law makes no distinctions on the basis of nobility. = Crowns and coronets of rank = File:Royal crown of the King of Sweden.svg Royal (Kunglig) crown File:Grevlig krona.svg Comital (Grevlig) coronet File:Friherrlig krona.svg Baronial (Friherrlig) coronet File:Adlig krona.svg Noble (Adlig) coronet Exceptional cases Outside Sweden, Saint Bridget (1303-1373) became known as the Princess of Nericia,Furstinnan fr√•n/av N√§rke Eivor Martinus in Barndrottningen Filippa, pp 115, 164 & 167 which appears to have been a noble, rather than a royal title, since she was not the daughter of a king.

Bertarelli had raced several smaller yachts named Alinghi previously, but 2003 was his first attempt at the America's Cup. Alinghi challenged for and won the 2003 America's Cup in Auckland New Zealand and successfully defended it at the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, Spain. Alinghi lost the America's Cup to the Golden Gate Yacht Club and their team BMW Oracle Racing in a Deed of Gift match in Valencia, Spain in February 2010. For the 2003 event, Team New Zealand as the holder of the America's Cup, in consultation with Prada, the Challenger of Record, removed the nationality rule that stipulated that all of the crew members must be nationals of the challenging syndicate. Alinghi took full advantage of this rule change and hired many of the world's top America's Cup sailors particularly from New Zealand. New Zealanders saw the defection of key members of Team New Zealand to Alinghi as an act of disloyalty to their home countryunderstandable against a background of strong nationwide public support for Team New Zealand that they saw as representing their country rather than just representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. After a series of discussions with Team New Zealand it was announced that they would compete in the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series in 2009. In July 2010, it appeared that the team was being disbanded and would not compete in future America's Cups. On 26 November 2010, Alinghi formally confirmed that it would not participate in the 2013 America's Cup. America's Cup = 2003 challenge = thumb Coinciding with the change in the nationality rules concerning the crew and in order to maximize the chances of success, Alinghi hired Russell Coutts, the successful skipper and helmsman of Team New Zealand. Coutts had already won the America's Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and successfully defended for New Zealand in 2000. Along with Coutts came several other important Kiwi sailors, including Team New Zealand tactician Brad Butterworth. Grant Simmer, another America's Cup veteran, joined as managing director and head of design. Bertarelli, the syndicate's president, served as navigator during the racing. Apart from New Zealand, the Alinghi team consisted of members from Germany, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Portugal, Turkey, Ireland, the UK (from Scotland and Wales), Belgium, South Africa, Australia, Uruguay, Argentina, Denmark, Ecuador, and Switzerland. The Alinghi boats for the 2003 challenge, SUI-64 (the race boat) and the SUI-75, were developed specifically for the race by the Alinghi team in close collaboration with the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. Alinghi also had a test yacht from the 2000 America's cup, SUI-59 (formerly called Fast 2000). Alinghi raced to a 5-0 victory against Team New Zealand on 2 March 2003, winning the America's Cup. They guaranteed themselves a further stake in the history books by becoming the first team since the inaugural race in 1851 to return the Auld Mug to Europe and for being the first team to win the Cup on its first attempt. Alinghi's stated vision was \\"to win the America's Cup, while earning respect and recognition as a world class sports team as well as sharing our passion\\". Due to this victory, Team Alinghi received one of the highest honors in sport, the Olympic Cup in 2004. The Coupe Olympique is an award given annually by the International Olympic Committee. =2007 defense= The boats SUI 91 and SUI 100. Team Alinghi fired its Skipper Russell Coutts on 27 April 2004. Immediately prior to this, Alinghi (via America's Cup Management) changed the America's Cup Rules to prevent any team members from moving between teams until completion of the 2007 America's Cup. Alinghi, as the then current holders of the America's Cup, were fully entitled to change the rule. Nine months later the conflict was ended with a short statement. The sailing team was extended again and was led for the 2007 campaign by Brad Butterworth, Alinghi's tactician and vice-president. Butterworth was highly experienced in America's Cup racing having sailed aboard the winning boat in the three previous competitions. Butterworth's team had many world-class sailors including Peter Holmberg, Ed Baird, Juan Vila, Jordi Calafat, Warwick Fleury, Simon Daubney, and Murray Jones. Jochen Sch√ºmann, winner of four Olympic medals, was the sports director for the sailing team. Alinghi participated in all Louis Vuitton Acts, along with the 11 challengers from nine nations, before defending the America's Cup during the Match Race in June 2007. UBS, and BT Infonet renewed their commitment to the team as Main Partners for the next four years, along with Audemars Piguet, SGS, Nespresso, MSC Cruises, WISeKey and North Sails as co sponsors. Alinghi's first America's Cup defeat came on 24 June 2007 when they were defeated by Emirates Team New Zealand in the second race of the 2007 America's Cup off Valencia. After a series of close races between the seemingly closely matched competitors, Alinghi won their final race against Emirates Team New Zealand on 3 July 2007, defending the America's cup with Five wins to Team New Zealand's two. The official time given by the America's Cup website is one second winning margin for race 7. = 2010 defense = America's Cup Management announced on 5 July 2007 that the protocol for the 2010 America's Cup had been agreed between the defending yacht club, Soci√©t√© Nautique de Gen√®ve of Switzerland and Challenger of Record, the Club N√°utico Espa√±ol de Vela of Spain. However this arrangement did not survive a legal challenge from BMW Oracle Racing, who successfully argued that Club N√°utico Espa√±ol de Vela was not a valid Challenger of Record due to non-compliance with the terms of the America's Cup Deed of Gift. Swiss based companies WISeKey and Hublot were the two primary sponsors of Alinghi's 2010 defense. After extensive court action, Golden Gate Yacht Club (whose team is BMW Oracle Racing) was declared Challenger of Record and sailed against Alinghi in a Deed of Gift match in February 2010 at Valencia, Spain. The competing boats, Alinghi 5 and USA 17, were both 90-foot multihulls. USA 17s rigid wing sail provided a decisive advantage and Golden Gate Yacht Club won the 2010 America's Cup two races to none.  D35 Trophy, Bol d'Or, Extreme Sailing Series, GC32 Racing Tour Alinghi has also competed in the D35 Trophy (winning it eight times), in the Bol d'Or (winning it seven times), in the Extreme Sailing Series (winning it four times), in the GC32 Racing Tour (winning it one time) and is GC32 World Champion in 2019.

Posthumous awards have been allowed since it was instituted. It was previously awarded to residents of Commonwealth countries (and in one case to Malta, a colony which subsequently became a Commonwealth country), most of which have since established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians including police, emergency services and merchant seamen. Many of the awards have been personally presented by the British monarch to recipients or, in the case of posthumous awards, to next of kin. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.Mussell, J.W. (Editor), (2018), Medal Yearbook 2019, (Token Publishing Ltd: Devon) Creation The George Cross was instituted on 24 September 1940 by King George VI.British Gallantry Medals (Abbott and Tamplin), p. 138 At this time, during the height of the Blitz, there was a strong desire to reward the many acts of civilian courage. The existing awards open to civilians were not judged suitable to meet the new situation, therefore it was decided that the George Cross and the George Medal would be instituted to recognise both civilian gallantry in the face of enemy action and brave deeds more generally. Announcing the new award, the King said: The medal was designed by Percy Metcalfe. The Warrant for the GC (along with that of the George Medal), dated 24 September 1940, was published in The London Gazette on 31 January 1941. The King in his speech announcing the new award, stated that it would rank next to the Victoria Cross. This was second on the Order of Wear, much higher than the then existing awards for bravery not in the presence of the enemy, the highest being the two-class Albert Medal (AM); and the lowest being the single class Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM). In a substitution of awards unprecedented in the history of British decorations, holders of the EGM were required to exchange their insignia for the GC,British Gallantry Awards by P E Abbott and J M A Tamplin list two AM in Gold awards between 1920 and 1939, p. 22. There were 130 EGM awards between 1922 and 1940, p. 242 most receiving their replacement GC at a formal investiture. The four honorary EGM awards to foreigners were not exchanged and could therefore continue to be worn.British Gallantry Medals (Abbott and Tamplin), p.242 In 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert Medal and the Edward Medal (EM) became George Cross recipients, but unlike the EGM exchange of insignia, they had the option of retaining their original insignia. Of the 64 holders of the Albert Medal and 68 holders of the Edward Medal eligible to exchange, 49 and 59 respectively took up the option.George Cross Database. Retrieved on 12 September 2007. Award The GC, which may be awarded posthumously, is granted in recognition of: The award is for civilians but also for military personnel whose actions would not normally be eligible to receive military awards, such as gallantry not in the face of the enemy. The Warrant states: In June 1941 the specification of the ribbon width was amended to one and a half inches. seventhly Bars can be awarded for further acts of bravery meriting the GC, although none have yet been awarded. In common with the Victoria Cross, in undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn, a miniature replica of the cross is affixed to the centre of the ribbon, a distinction peculiar to these two premier awards for bravery. In the event of a second award, a second replica would be worn on the ribbon. eighthly Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters GC.London Gazette, No. 35060 ‚Äì Warrant, Eighth clause All original individual GC awards are published in The London Gazette.The awards to Malta and the RUC were not gazetted. The Exchange awards are not gazetted although the original EGM, AM and EM announcements were gazetted. George Cross Committee The George Cross Committee of the Cabinet Office considers cases of military and civilian gallantry. The Committee has no formal terms of reference. Recipients Since its inception in 1940, the GC has been awarded 408 times, 394 to men, 12 to women, one award to the Island of Malta and one to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). About half the recipients have been civilians. There have been 163 original awards including those to Malta and RUC, including 106 made before 1947.British Gallantry Medals (Abbott and Tamplin), p. 142 There have been 245 exchange awards, 112 to Empire Gallantry Medal recipients, 65 to Albert Medal recipients and 68 to Edward Medal recipients.Kevin Brazier. The complete George Cross, Pen & Sword, 2012, Of the 161 individuals who received original awards, 86 have been posthumous. In addition, there were four posthumous recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal whose awards were gazetted after the start of the Second World War and whose awards were also exchanged for the GC. All the other exchange recipients were living as of the date of the decisions for the exchanges. =Collective awards= The Flag of Malta displays its George Cross The George Cross has been awarded to the island of Malta and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Malta The George Cross awarded to Malta (National War Museum, Malta) The GC was awarded to the island of Malta in a letter dated 15 April 1942 from King George VI to the island's Governor Lieutenant-General Sir William Dobbie: The Governor answered: The cross and the messages are today in the War Museum in Fort Saint Elmo, Valletta. The fortitude of the population under sustained enemy air raids, and a naval blockade which almost saw them starved into submission, won widespread admiration in Britain and other Allied nations. Some historians argue that the award was a propaganda gesture to justify the huge losses sustained by Britain to prevent Malta from capitulating as Singapore had done in the Battle of Singapore. The George Cross was incorporated into the Flag of Malta beginning in 1943 and remains on the flag adopted at the country's independence in 1964. Royal Ulster Constabulary The GC was awarded to the RUC in 1999 by Queen Elizabeth II following the advice of the first Blair ministry. The citation published by Buckingham Palace on 23 November 1999 stated: The RUC was controversial before and during the Troubles; typically, Irish nationalists saw it as pro-unionist, while unionists had solidarity with the hundreds of RUC officers killed by republican paramilitaries. As part of the Northern Ireland peace process an Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland produced the \\"Patten Report\\" in September 1999, which recommended structural changes and renaming the RUC the \\"Police Service of Northern Ireland\\" (PSNI). The subsequent GC award was interpreted by some as a compensation or sop to unionists and RUC supporters for accepting the substantive changes; the UK government denied this. The Queen presented the George Cross on 12 April 2000 in a ceremony at Hillsborough Castle, County Down attended by the senior RUC officers; the cross was accepted by PC Paul Slaine, who had lost both legs in a 1992 IRA attack. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 gave effect to much of the Patten Report, with \\"the Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary)\\" established on 4 November 2001; The pre-2001 RUC is often retrospectively referred to by sympathisers as \\"RUC GC\\"; the 2000 act established a registered charity 'to be known as \\"The Royal Ulster Constabulary GC Foundation\\" for the purpose of marking the sacrifices and honouring the achievements of the Royal Ulster Constabulary'; other instances include the names of the RUC GC Widows' Association, RUC GC Historical Society, and RUCGC‚ÄìPSNI Benevolent Fund. =Awards to Commonwealth citizens= Canada There have been 10 GCs awarded to Canadians including those by substitution for awards superseded by the GC. The recipients comprised nine men and one woman. The GC is no longer awarded to Canadians by the Queen of Canada, who awards the Canadian Cross of Valour instead. Australia Memorial to Australian recipients, George Cross Park, Canberra The George Cross was awarded to 22 Australians, 11 to the Australian forces and 11 to civilians. It is the highest decoration of the Australian Honours System after the British Victoria Cross and the Victoria Cross for Australia. Although Australia established the Cross of Valour within the Australian Honours System in 1975 'for acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril' it was not until 1992 that Australia officially ceased recommending British honours. During the period 1975 to 1992, the last George Cross to an Australian was awarded in 1978. Of the 22 awards, 14 were direct awards and eight were Empire Gallantry Medal (two) and Albert Medal (six) exchange awards. Four awards were to officers of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve who served in the extremely dangerous role of mine disposal during the Second World War. Privates Benjamin Gower Hardy and Ralph Jones were posthumously awarded the George Cross for manning a Vickers machine gun during the Cowra breakout, a mass escape by Japanese prisoners of war in central New South Wales on 5 August 1944. Hardy and Jones disabled the weapon and denied its use to the escaping prisoners before they were overwhelmed and killed by the escapees. Courage of a different sort was displayed by two prisoners of war who endured terrible suffering. Captain Lionel Colin Matthews was eventually executed by his captors for building a resistance network in British North Borneo in the Second World War, while Private Horace William Madden, captured in Korea in 1951, died of privations while assisting fellow prisoners and openly resisting enemy efforts to force him to collaborate. The last Australian to be awarded the GC (in 1978) was Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt of the Victoria Police, Melbourne, for arresting two armed bank robbers in June 1976. A memorial to Australian recipients, George Cross Park, was opened in Canberra, the Australian capital, on 4 April 2001 by the Governor General of Australia, Sir William Deane. New Zealand In 1999, the New Zealand Cross replaced the role of the George Cross. Up until then, the last George Cross awarded to a New Zealander, and a civilian, was posthumously awarded to Sgt Stewart Guthrie of the New Zealand Police for his actions and bravery during the Aramoana massacre. Annuity Holders of the Victoria Cross or the George Cross are entitled to an annuity, the amount of which is determined by the awarding government. ‚Äì Warrant, Fourteenth clause Since 2015, the annuity paid by the British government is ¬£10,000 per year.The Independent, 7 July 2015. ¬£10,000 annuity for VC and GC winners In Canada under the Gallantry Awards Order, members of the Canadian Forces, or people who joined the British forces before 31 March 1949 while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland, receive $3,000 per year. Australia has been responsible for the payment of both the Victoria Cross Allowance and the George Cross annuity since the 1940s. The Victoria Cross Allowance which includes both the Victoria Cross for Australia and the British Victoria Cross is included in s.103 of the Veterans' Entitlement Act and is presently $A4,447.00 per year. Although there is not a statutory instrument for the payment of the George Cross annuity, both annuities for the Australian Cross of Valour and George Cross match the Victoria Cross Allowance payment. Restriction of use Since 1943, in accordance with the George Cross (Restriction of Use) Ordinance, it is unlawful in Malta to use the George Cross, an imitation of it or the words George Cross for the purposes of trade or business without the Prime Minister's authorisation.Chapter 115 - George Cross (Restriction of Use) Ordinance George Cross in fiction The fictional detective inspector William E. \\"Jack\\" Frost in the novels of R. D. Wingfield and television series A Touch Of Frost is a recipient of the George Cross, which sometimes serves as a plot element in allowing him to get away with actions that would otherwise have landed him in trouble. The character tends to experience survivor guilt whenever his George Cross is brought to mind. Charles (Karl, Graf von) Dennim, the protagonist in Geoffrey Household's 1960 thriller Watcher in the Shadows, was awarded the George Cross for espionage work during the Second World War, including undercover service as a Gestapo officer at the Buchenwald concentration camp. He refused to accept the award on the basis that \\"one does not defile a decoration\\". Ray Davies makes reference to George Cross recipients in the Kinks song \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\" with the lyric \\"God save the George Cross and all those who were awarded them\\". The words \\"and all those who were awarded them\\" are, in fact, the only lyrics in the entire song that are not harmonized. Hugh Grant's character, Alexander Waverly, in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015) is a recipient of the George Cross. Alex O'Loughlin's character Steve McGarrett and Scott Caan's character Danny Williams in the Hawaii Five-0 episode \\"No Ke Ali'i' Wahine A Me Ka Aina\\" (2016) are recipients of the George Cross for stopping a terrorist attack against Europe.

Haiti hadn't had a recorded music until 1937 when Jazz Guignard was recorded non-commercially. One of the most popular Haitian artists is Wyclef Jean. His music is somewhat hip-hop mixed with world music. Haitian music is influenced mostly by European colonial ties and African migration (through slavery). In the case of European colonization, musical influence has derived primarily from the French. One of Haiti's musical traditions is known to outsiders simply as compas. But in the former non-standardized Haitian Creole, Haitians identify it variously as compa, conpa, and konpa-dir√©k. Regardless of its various spellings, compas refers to a complex, ever-changing music genre that fuses African rhythms, European ballroom dancing, and Haitian bourgeois aesthetics. The word may have derived from the Spanish comp√°s, which relates to the musical rhythm of the \\"beat\\" or \\"pulse.\\" One of the most distinctive features of Haitian compas music is the steady, pulsing drum beat, which makes it easy to dance to. Ha√Øti Ch√©rie is a traditional patriotic and most recognizable song of Haiti that was written and composed by Dr. Othello Bayard de Cayes and was initially called Souvenir d'Ha√Øti. It represents the pride Haitian people feel for their country and culture. Within the Haitian community, at home and abroad, it is widely considered as a second national anthem to La Dessalinienne and the song has recorded several different versions. Folk music =Kontradans= =M√©ringue= M√©ringue is a guitar-based style historically connected to merengue but without the use of the accordion. The blend of African and European cultures has created popular dance music, music played on simple acoustic instruments. M√©ringue has lost popularity to kompa. =Rara= Rara music is a Lenten processional music with strong ties to the Vodou religious tradition. It has often been confused with Haitian Carnival, since both celebrations involve large groups of dancing revelers in the streets. Rara is performed between Ash Wednesday (the day after Carnival ends) until Easter Sunday (or Easter Monday in some parts of Haiti.) Rara bands roam the streets performing religious ceremonies as part of their ritual obligations to the \\"loa\\" or spirits of Haitian Vodou. Gu√©d√©, a spirit associated with death and sexuality, is an important spiritual presence in Rara celebrations and often possesses a houngan (male Vodou priest) or mambo (female Vodou priest) before the band begins its procession, blessing the participants and wishing them safe travels for their nightly sojourns. =Twoubadou= Twoubadou is a form of music played by peripatetic troubadours playing some combination of acoustic, guitar, beat box and accordion instruments singing ballads of Haitian, French or Caribbean origin. It is in some ways similar to Son Cubano from Cuba as a result of Haitian migrant laborers who went to work on Cuban sugar plantations at the turn of the 20th century. Musicians perform at the Port-au-Prince International Airport and also at bars and restaurants in P√©tion-Ville. Popular music =Compas / Kompa= Compas, short for compas direct, is the modern m√©ringue (mereng in creole) that was popularized in the mid-1950s by the sax and guitar player Nemours Jean-Baptiste. His m√©ringue soon became popular throughout the Antilles, especially in Martinique and Guadeloupe. Webert Sicot and Nemours Jean-Baptiste became the two leaders in the group. Sicot then left and formed a new group and an intense rivalry developed, though they remained good friends. To differentiate himself from Nemours, Sicot called his modern m√©ringue, cadence rampa. In Creole, it is spelled as konpa dir√®k or simply konpa. It is commonly spelled as it is pronounced as kompa. =Mini-jazz= Mini-jazz was formed in the mid-'60s characterized by the rock bands formula of two guitars, one bass, drum-conga- cowbell, some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordion or lead guitar. However, all these small jazz or bands had their guitars with sophisticated styles. The 1970s were dominated by mini-jazz, which still used a variant of the m√©ringue style. One of the mini-jazz groups, Tabou Combo, became the most popular ensemble of Haiti. From Haiti the mini- jazz formula replicated in the French Antilles in the 1970s. =Haitian rock (rock krey√≤l)= Haitian rock originated as rock n roll in Haiti in the early 1960s, performed by rock bands called yeye bands. These were short-lived when they added compas direct to their repertoire and called the result mini-jazz. Today, Haitian rock is an alternative rock music with a blend of Caribbean flavor that was first introduced to Haiti by Yohann Dor√©. Splash were a popular Haitian rock band of the 1990s.Schwann Spectrum - Volume 7 1995 ... similar to Boukman's, has the advantage of lead singer Eddy Fran√ßois, whose rich, grainy voice can whip an audience into a frenzy, and guitarist Vladimir \\"Jimmy\\" Jean-Felix, who previously fronted Haiti's most popular rock band, Splash. =Mizik rasin= Theodore Lolo Beabrun, Lead Singer of 229x229px Starting in the late 1970s (with discontent surrounding the increasing opulence of the Duvalier dictatorship), youth from Port-au-Prince (and to a lesser extent Cap-Ha√Øtien and other urban areas) began experimenting with new types of life. Fran√ßois Duvalier's appropriation of Vodou images as a terror technique, the increase in U.S. assembly and large-scale export agriculture, the popularity of disco, and Jean-Claude Duvalier's appreciation of kompa and chanson fran√ßaise disillusioned many youth and love. To question the dictatorship's notion of \\"the Haitian nation\\" (and thus the dictatorship itself), several men began trying a new way of living, embodied in the Sanba Movement. They drew upon global trends in black power, Bob Marley, \\"Hippie\\"-dom, as well as prominently from rural life in Haiti. They dressed in the traditional blue denim (karoko) of peasants, eschewed the commercialized and processed life offered by global capitalism, and celebrated the values of communal living. Later, they adopted matted hair similar to dreadlocks, but identified the style as something that existed in Haiti with the term cheve simbi, referring to water spirits. The most well-known of these were Sanba Zao (Louis Leslie Marcellin), Ayizan (Harry Sanon), Azouke (Gregory Sanon), Aboudja (Ronald Derencourt), Kebyesou Danle (Jean Raymond) and Chico (Yves Boyer). They formed a band called Sanba yo and later, Gwoup Sa. Later still, other musicians like Lolo (Theodore Beaubrun), Papa Bonga, and Eddy Fran√ßois joined the trend. This was the modern precursor to what would become mizik rasin. One of these groups recorded a song in the 1980s for a UNICEF campaign for vaccination, which is included on the LP Konbit!. In the 1990s, commercial success came to the musical genre that came to be known as mizik rasin, or roots music. Musicians like Boukman Eksperyans, and Boukan Ginen, and to a lesser extent RAM, incorporated reggae, rock and funk rhythms into traditional forms and instrumentation, including rara, music from kanaval, or traditional spiritual music from the rural hamlets called lakous, like Lakou Souvnans, Lakou Badjo, Lakou Soukri, or Lakou Dereyal. Though initially the people involved followed the ways of the Sanba Movement, eventually this began to fade. Increased political and economic pressures saw many of these people emigrate (to the U.S. and Canada, primarily). Both those who stayed and those who traveled between countries began adding more non-Haitian (strictly speaking) elements and implemented a more commercial sound to earn more money and a wider audience. RAM recorded a traditional Vodou folk song in Ha√Øti called \\"F√®y\\". In Haitian Creole, \\"f√®y\\" means \\"leaf\\", and the lyrics of the song describe a leaf falling from a tree. =Zouk or zouk-love= The Haitian cadence and its compas has been dominating the Antilles music scene since its introduction in the late 1950s. Compas direct is a modern m√©ringue popularized in 1955 by the Nemours Jean-Baptiste, a Haitian saxophone and guitar player, which was appropriated by the Antilleans who labeled their version cadence- lypso and later, zouk or zouk-love. The original zouk was zouk b√©ton, a fast tempo jump up carnival style of music originating from the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, was popularized by the French Antilles Kassav' in the 1980s. However it was too fast, and the style lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of kadans or compas, the main music of the French Antilles. The problem is that musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe have wrongly labeled compas as zouk or zouk love, creating a sense of confusion in Africa, Cape Verde, Angola, Brazil, Portugal and other places. Haitian musicians taught Antilleans how to play compas, and it is from them that zouk's rhythms derive in origin, which some credit is due in its creation. In all account, Haitian musicians describe zouk musicians as first rate, because they are now part of the forefront of the musical scene. Today, zouk-love (the current zouk) is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. =Haitian hip hop (rap krey√≤l)= The local homegrown Haitian hip hop movement is rising in popularity in Haiti and other Haitian communities. It is becoming more and more popular with Haitian youth, often communicating social and political topics as well as materialism. Kompa as well as other popular local music beats are used frequently with urban sounds. Recent years have seen a rise in popularity for Haitian Hip-Hop artists such as Barikad Crew and Jimmy O. Other Haitian hip hop artists have yet to evolve. Spiritual music =Haitian Gospel music= =Haitian Vodou drumming= Music education and mentoring BLUME Haiti (Building Leaders Using Music Education) is an American NGO that trains teachers of classical music in Haiti and partners with other organizations to provide training in instrument repair. It has reached approximately 5,000 students. It partners with Luthiers Sans Frontieres UK among others. Carrefour Collaborative, an NGO based in Chicago, promotes and produces Underground music and musicians in Haiti by providing high end audio recording equipment, video production help and mentors. The goal is exposure to American audiences. Gaetville, an MC who also does Hip Hop and Dance Hall music, was the first musician they produced. El Sistemia - a Venezuelan method of teaching classical music, started in Haiti in 2012 with the encouragement of the current president Michael Martelly - a former singer. Music institutions and festivals The Haitian Carnival is an important part of the Haitian culture. It is also significant for Haitian musicians as an opportunity to showcase their talents and expand their audience by performing for Carnival crowds. Ten days after the 2010 earthquake, the \\"Hope for Haiti Now\\" telethon event was launched in the United States, effectively taking over the mediasphere and reaching hundreds of millions of households and viewers. It focused on appealing to the viewing public's empathy for the survivors of the disaster, allowing ordinary citizens to help in a collective relief effort by contributing money donations to NGOs providing Humanitarian aid to earthquake survivors. The telethon attracted support through a variety of celebrity musical performances and staged calls for empathy, using digital social networks to disseminate its appeal to the moral responsibility of the viewer-consumers. It offered the possibility for viewers to text donations on cell phones, and raised a reported $58 million by the day after its launch. The form of this fundraising effort emphasizes and aligns with the power of music and singing in Haitian society. Quake survivors used the embodied technique of singing to orient themselves in the face of sudden and violent rupture.

Biography He was the eldest son of Dr. James Dixon, a distinguished Wesleyan preacher, by Mary, only daughter of the Rev. Richard Watson. In the biography he wrote of his father, Dixon describes his mother as 'an excellent Latin and Greek scholar, a perfect French and a sufficient Italian linguist, and an exquisite musician;' and of his grandmother, Mrs. Watson, who made a home with her daughter, he retained an affectionate recollection as of a very good and clever woman. Both the Watsons and Dixons belonged to the early school of Methodists, who did not renounce their membership in the church of England, so that there was no feeling that Dixon had been disloyal to their communion when he prepared for orders in the church. He was born on 5 May 1833 at Islington, and educated, under Dr. Gifford, at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he had for school friends Edwin Hatch and Edward Burne-Jones. In June 1851, he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, and when in the Christmas term of the same year Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris came up to Exeter College, they, with Fulford, Faulkner, Cormell Price, and a few more, formed a close brotherhood. An excellent account of these Oxford days was contributed by Dixon to Mr. J. W. Mackail's Life of Morris. He says ‚ÄòJones and Morris were both meant for holy orders, and the same may be said of the rest of us except Faulkner; but the bond of alliance was poetry and indefinite artistic and literary aspirations. We all had the notion of doing great things for men according to our own will and bent.‚Äô With Morris, Dixon projected the ‚ÄòOxford and Cambridge Magazine,‚Äô and had a hand, under Rossetti's direction, in the amateur distempering of the walls of Woodward's new debating hall at the Oxford Union with frescoes from the Arthurian Romances, now almost completely obliterated. Dixon did not in after life pursue painting as a study‚Äîa single canvas, a wedding-scene from Chaucer, is, it is believed, the only picture of his that survives ‚Äîbut he always retained his interest, and a visit to the old masters in the National Gallery was a regular incident of any visit to London. At Oxford Dixon read for the ordinary classical schools, and graduated B.A. in 1857. The next year he won the Arnold historical prize for an essay on ‚ÄòThe Close of the Tenth Century of the Christian Era,‚Äô and in 1863 Oxford's Sacred Poem Prize, the subject being ‚ÄòSt. John in Patmos.‚Äô The poem is in the heroic couplet, and is a very dignified and impressive piece of writing. His first published volume of poems, called ‚ÄòChrist's Company,‚Äô had already appeared in 1861, and a second, ‚ÄòHistorical Odes,‚Äô followed in 1863. These early poems of Dixon were distinguished by not a little of the colour and imagination, and also by something of the eccentricity, that marked the early efforts of the Pre-Raphaelite school. The poems of the first volume, though largely upon religious subjects, are not strictly religious poetry; they are works of picturesque imagination rather than of devotional feeling. The ‚ÄòHistorical Odes‚Äô show an advance in simplicity, and a power, that Dixon afterwards carried further, of ode construction. The odes upon Wellington and Marlborough contain much good writing, and deserve more attention than they have received. After leaving Oxford, Dixon lodged for a time with Morris and Burne-Jones in Red Lion Square. In 1858, he was ordained to the curacy of St. Mary-the-Less, Lambeth, Mr. Gregory, the present dean of St. Paul's, giving him his title. In 1861, he moved to the curacy of St. Mary, Newington Butts, and became an assistant master at Highgate School, where his pupils included Gerard Manley Hopkins. From 1863 to 1868 he was second master at Carlisle High School, and from 1868 to 1875 minor canon and honorary librarian of Carlisle Cathedral. After that he was for eight years vicar of Hayton, in Cumberland, and was then presented by the bishop of Carlisle to the vicarage of Warkworth in Northumberland, which he held till his death. Besides these small livings, Dixon received no preferment in the church, although the best years of his life were devoted to writing a church history, which took rank from the first moment of its appearance as a standard authority. His friends would have greatly valued for him the increase of leisure and opportunities for study which a cathedral stall would have afforded; but it was not to be. The distinctions which he received after the appearance of the first volume of his history, in 1877, were such as to reduce the already scanty leisure of a hardworked parish clergyman. In 1874, he had been made honorary canon of Carlisle; in 1879 he became rural dean of Brampton; in 1884 rural dean of Alnwick; and in 1891 examining chaplain to the bishop of Newcastle. He was chaplain to the high sheriff of Cumberland in 1883, and from 1890 to 1894 was a proctor in convocation. He was always singularly modest as to his claims upon recognition; but it gave him genuine pleasure when in the last year of his life his university conferred upon him an honorary doctor's degree in divinity, and his college made him an honorary fellow. In 1885, he stood for the professorship of poetry at Oxford, but withdrew his candidature before the election. The short preface to 'Eudocia and her Brothers' upon the use of the heroic couplet shows that he possessed keen critical powers and a faculty of lucid exposition. Dixon was briefly considered for Poet Laureate when Alfred Tennyson died in 1892.MacCarthy, Fiona. William Morris: A Life for Our Time. Knopf: New York, 1995. In December 1891 Dixon had a severe attack of influenza, which for some long time diminished his power of writing, but he ultimately recovered; a second attack in January 1900 carried him off after a few days' illness. Family On 9 April 1861, he married the widow of William Thomson of Haddingtonshire (n√©e Maria Sturgeon). His first wife having died in 1876, Dixon married in 1882 Matilda, eldest daughter of George Routledge. He had no children by either marriage; but he proved an affectionate step-father to the daughters of his first wife.

Considered to be an icon of the city and the Pacific Northwest, it has been designated a Seattle landmark. Located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, it was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors. Nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators during the event. The Space Needle was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River, standing at . The tower is wide, weighs , and is built to withstand winds of up to and earthquakes of up to 9.0 magnitude, as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. It also has 25 lightning rods. The Space Needle features an observation deck above ground, providing views of the downtown Seattle skyline, the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay, and various islands in Puget Sound. Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle by elevators that travel at , completing the ascent in 41 seconds (they are slowed to on windy days). On April 19, 1999, the city's Landmarks Preservation Board designated the tower a historic landmark. Architecture Left to right: CN Tower (Toronto), Willis Tower (Chicago), Stratosphere (Las Vegas), Space Needle The architecture of the Space Needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two men, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham, Jr. The two leading ideas for the World Fair involved businessman Edward E. Carlson's sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground (the gently sloping base) and architect John Graham's concept of a flying saucer (the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck). Victor Steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower. The Space Needle was built to withstand wind speeds of , double the requirements in the building code of 1962. The 6.8 Nisqually earthquake jolted the Needle enough in 2001 for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms. The Space Needle will not sustain serious structural damage during earthquakes of magnitudes below 9.1. Also made to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds, the Space Needle sways only per of wind speed. For decades, the hovering disk of the Space Needle was home to 2 restaurants above the ground: the Space Needle Restaurant, which was originally named Eye of the Needle, and Emerald Suite. These were closed in 2000 to make way for SkyCity, a larger restaurant that features Pacific Northwest cuisine. SkyCity rotates 360 degrees in exactly forty-seven minutes. In 1993, the elevators were replaced with new computerized versions. The new elevators descend at a rate of . On December 31, 1999, a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time. Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward from the top of the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates. Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year. It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. A 1962 Seattle World's Fair poster showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator that was ultimately omitted from final building plans. The stairway was eventually added as part of the Pavilion and Spacebase remodel in June 2000. The main stairwell has 848 steps from the basement to the top of the observation deck. At approximately , the Space Needle was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River at the time it was built by Howard S. Wright Construction Co., but is now dwarfed by other structures along the Seattle skyline, among them the Columbia Center, at . Unlike many other similar structures, such as the CN Tower in Toronto, the Space Needle is not used for broadcasting purposes. History =Construction= Space Needle and various buildings for the Seattle World's Fair under construction, 1961 Edward F. Carlson, chairman of the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the World's Fair. Carlson was president of a hotel company and was not recognized in art or design, but he was inspired by a recent visit to the Stuttgart Tower of Germany. Local architect John Graham soon became involved as a result of his success in designing Northgate Mall. Graham's first move was to alter the restaurant's original design to a revolving restaurant, similar to his previous design of the La Ronde tower restaurant at the Ala Moana Shopping Center in Hawaii. The proposed Space Needle had no pre-selected site. Since it was not financed by the city, land had to be purchased within the fairgrounds. The investors had been unable to find suitable land and the search for a site was nearly dead when, in 1961, they discovered a lot, , containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems. The land sold for $75,000. At this point, only one year remained before the World's Fair would begin. The Needle was privately financed and built by the Pentagram Corporation, consisting of Bagley Wright, contractor Howard S. Wright, architect John Graham, Ned Skinner, and Norton Clapp. In 1977 Bagley, Skinner and Clapp sold their interest to Howard Wright who now controls it under the name of Space Needle Corporation. The earthquake stability of the Space Needle was ensured when a hole was dug deep and across, and 467 concrete trucks took one full day to fill it. The foundation weighs (including of reinforcing steel), the same as the above-ground structure. The structure is bolted to the foundation with 72 bolts, each one long. With time an issue, the construction team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing the top five levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate with the help of one tiny electric motor, originally , later replaced with a motor. With paint colors named Orbital Olive for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last elevator car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair nearly 20,000 people a day rode the elevators to the Observation Deck. Upon completion, the Space Needle was the tallest building in the western United States, replacing the Smith Tower in downtown Seattle as the tallest building west of the Mississippi since 1914. Completed Space Needle after the opening of the World's Fair - April 1962 The revolving restaurant was operated by Western International Hotels, of which Carlson was President, under a 20-year contract from April 1, 1962 to April 1, 1982. =Carillon= An imitation carillon (using recordings of bells, rather than live bells) was installed in the Space Needle, and played several times a day during the World's Fair. The instrument, built by the Schulmerich Bells Company of Hatfield, Pennsylvania under the name \\"Carillon Americana,\\" recreated the sounds of 538 bells and was the largest in the world, until eclipsed by a 732 bell instrument at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The operator's console was located in the base of the Space Needle, completely enclosed in glass to allow observation of the musician playing the instrument. It was also capable of being played from a roll, like a player piano. The forty-four stentors (speakers) of the carillon were located underneath the Needle's disc at the level, and were audible over the entire fairgrounds and up to away. The carillon was disassembled after the fair's close. The Carillon Americana was featured on a 12-track LP record called \\"Bells On High-Fi\\" (catalog number AR-8, produced by Americana Records, of Sellersville, Pennsylvania). These studio recordings were performed by noted carilloneur John Klein (1915-1981). =After the Fair= The Needle's observation level roof painted for the 50th anniversary in the original 1962 Galaxy Gold A radio broadcast studio was built on the observation level of the Space Needle in 1963. It was used for morning broadcasts by Radio KING and its sister TV station KING-TV from July 1963 to May 1966, and KIRO Radio from 1966 to 1974. Disc jockey Bobby Wooten of country music station KAYO-AM lived in an apartment built adjacent to the Space Needle's broadcast studio for six months in 1974, which required a permit variance from the city government. In 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove's children's book Wheedle on the Needle imagined a furry creature called the Wheedle who lived on top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: There's a Wheedle on the Needle / I know just what you're thinking / But if you look up late at night / You'll see his red nose blinking. The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, who played in nearby KeyArena (originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008. In 1982, the SkyLine level was added at the height of . While this level had been part of the original plans for the Space Needle, it was not built until this time. Today, the SkyLine Banquet Facility can accommodate groups of 20‚Äì360 people. Renovations were completed in 2000 at a cost ($21 million) approximately the same in inflated dollars as the original construction price. Renovations between 1999 and 2000 included the SkyCity restaurant, SpaceBase retail store, Skybeam installation, Observation Deck overhaul, lighting additions and repainting. Every year on New Year's Eve, the Space Needle celebrates with a fireworks show at midnight that is synchronized to music. Alberto Navarro, a fireworks artist from Bellevue, is the lead architect of the show, which is viewed by thousands from the Seattle Center grounds. In 2000, public celebrations were canceled because of perceived terror threats against the structure after investigations into the foiled millennium bombing plots, but the fireworks show was still performed. The 2020 fireworks display was canceled because of high winds, with a laser light show being used at midnight instead. In 2002, a real estate consultant in Bellevue proposed the construction of five smaller replicas of the Space Needle around the city to promote tourism, though the proposal has not yet materialized. On May 19, 2007, the Space Needle welcomed its 45 millionth visitor, who received a free trip for two to Paris. In May 2008, the Space Needle received its first professional cleaning since the opening of the 1962 World's Fair. The monument was pressure washed by K√§rcher with water at a pressure of and a temperature of . No detergents were used in consideration of the Seattle Center and the Museum of Pop Culture. As part of the celebration of its 50th anniversary, the Needle was painted \\"Galaxy Gold\\" in April 2012, the same color used when the needle was originally constructed for the 1962 World's Fair. This temporary makeover, intended to last through the summer, is not the Needle's first: it had the University of Washington (UW) Huskies football team logo painted after the team won the 1992 Rose Bowl, appeared as a giant \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" in 1995, was painted crimson after Washington State won the Apple Cup, and has been seen in Seattle SuperSonics colors. Scaffold surrounding top section during 2017‚Äì2018 renovation A renovation of the top of the Space Needle began in the summer of 2017, to add an all-glass floor to the restaurant, and replace the observation platform windows with floor-to-ceiling glass panels to more closely match the 1962 original concept sketches, as well as upgrades and updates to the internal systems. Called the Century Project, the work was scheduled to finish by June 2018, at a cost of $100 million in private funds. The designer is Olson Kundig Architects and the general contractor is Hoffman Construction Company. The rotating restaurant's motor was replaced, the elevator capacity was increased by adding elevators, or double-stacking them, and the energy efficiency of the building was improved with the aim of achieving LEED Silver Certification. The temporary scaffold's , platform under the top structure was assembled on the ground, and then lifted by cables from the ground to the underside of the structure, controlled by 12 operators standing on the platform as it was raised. The platform was made by Safway Services, a company specializing in unique construction scaffolding. The space reopened in August 2018 as the Loupe, an indoor observation deck. Jumping incidents Six parachutists have leaped from the tower since its opening, in a sport known as BASE jumping. This activity is legal only with prior authorization. Four of them were part of an authorized promotion in 1996, and the other two were arrested. Paul D. Baker was the first person to jump from the Space Needle in a successful suicide attempt on March 4, 1974. Mary Lucille Wolf also jumped from the tower that year, on May 25. Following the two 1974 suicides, netting beneath and improved fencing around the observation deck were installed. In spite of the barrier additions, however, another suicide by Dixie Reeder occurred on July 5, 1978. Appearances in TV and film As a symbol of the Pacific Northwest, the Space Needle has made numerous appearances in films, TV shows, and other works of fiction. The Space Needle is often used in establishing shots as an economical means to tell the audience the setting is Seattle. Examples include the TV shows Frasier, Grey's Anatomy, Dark Angel, Bill Nye the Science Guy, and films It Happened at the World's Fair (1962) and The Parallax View (1974) where it was used as a filming location, and Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Chronicle (2012).  In the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me made an absurdist visual gag conflating another icon of Seattle, Starbucks, with the tower, showing the coffee chains's name written across the Space Needle's saucer placing the villain Doctor Evil's base of operations there after his henchman Number 2 shifted the organization's resources toward the coffee company. As a visual symbol of Seattle, the Space Needle has been incorporated into the logos of NBA, WNBA, and NHL professional sports teams. The Space Needle has been involved in practical jokes, especially those on April Fools' Day. In 1989, KING-TV's Almost Live! reported that the Space Needle had collapsed, causing panicked people to call emergency services and forcing the station to apologize afterwards; the incident was compared to the 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, which caused nationwide panic. In 2015, public radio station KPLU 88.5 FM reported in the news story \\"Proposed Development To 'Assimilate' Seattle's Landmark Space Needle?\\" that a permit application (Notice of Proposed Land Use Action) had been submitted \\"to construct a 666 unit cube to assimilate\\" the landmark. Other TV appearances include The History Channel's Life After People, in which the tower collapses after 200 years because of corrosion. The tower was also destroyed in the TV miniseries 10.5 when a 7.9 earthquake hits Seattle. The miniseries mistakenly portrays the Needle as crumbling concrete, though the structure is actually made of steel and designed to withstand up to a 9.0 earthquake.

While it is often presented as a single work in six movements and ‚Äì with the exception of Vltava ‚Äì is almost always recorded that way, the six pieces were conceived as individual works. They had their own separate premieres between 1875 and 1880; the premiere of the complete set took place on 5 November 1882 in ≈Ωof√≠n Palace, Prague,≈Ωof√≠n Palace Official site of ≈Ωof√≠n Palace, accessed 7 December 2016. under Adolf ƒåech, who had also conducted two of the individual premieres. In these works Smetana combined the symphonic poem form pioneered by Franz Liszt with the ideals of nationalistic music which were current in the late nineteenth century. Each poem depicts some aspect of the countryside, history, or legends of Bohemia. Since 1952 the works have been performed to open the Prague Spring International Music Festival on 12 May, the anniversary of the death of their composer.  Vy≈°ehrad  Vy≈°ehrad above the Vltava River The first poem, Vy≈°ehrad (The High Castle), composed between the end of September and 18 November 1874 and premiered on 14 March 1875, describes the Vy≈°ehrad castle in Prague which was the seat of the earliest Czech kings. During the summer of 1874, Smetana began to lose his hearing, and total deafness soon followed; he described the gradual, but rapid loss of his hearing in a letter of resignation to the director of the Royal Provincial Czech Theatre, Anton√≠n ƒå√≠≈æek. In July 1874 he began hearing anomalous noise and then a permanent buzzing. Not long after the onset he was unable to distinguish individual sounds. At the beginning of October he lost all hearing in his right ear, and finally on 20 October in his left. His treatment was based on maintaining isolation from all sounds, but was unsuccessful.Marta Ottlov√°, et al. \\"Smetana, Bed≈ôich\\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 1 November 2012. The poem begins with the sounds of the harp of the mythical singer Lum√≠r, and then crosses over into the tones of the castle's arsenal. This section of the music introduces the main motifs, which are used in other parts of the cycle. A four note motif (B-E-D-B) represents the castle of Vy≈°ehrad; this is heard again at the end of 'Vltava' and once more, to round the whole cycle off, at the conclusion of 'Blan√≠k'. { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\tempo \\"Lento\\" 4=50 4\\\\f -> r8  4 } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 -> r8  4 } >> } In the score two harps are required to perform the opening arpeggios. After a dominant seventh chord, the winds take up the theme, followed by the strings, before the whole orchestra is employed to reach a climax. In the next part, Smetana recalls the story of the castle, using a faster tempo which becomes a march. A seemingly triumphant climax is cut short by a descending passage depicting the collapse of the castle, and the music falls quiet. Then the opening harp material is heard again and the music reminds again of the beauty of the castle, now in ruins. The music ends quietly, depicting the River Vltava flowing below the castle. Conceived between 1872 and 1874, it is the only piece in the cycle to be mostly completed before Smetana began to go noticeably deaf in the summer of 1874. Most performances last approximately fifteen minutes in duration.  Vltava  The Vltava in Prague Vltava, also known by its English title , and the German , was composed between 20 November and 8 December 1874 and was premiered on 4 April 1875 under Adolf ƒåech. It is about 13 minutes long, and is in the key of E minor. In this piece, Smetana uses tone painting to evoke the sounds of one of Bohemia's great rivers. In his own words: > The composition describes the course of the Vltava, starting from the two > small springs, the Cold and Warm Vltava, to the unification of both streams > into a single current, the course of the Vltava through woods and meadows, > through landscapes where a farmer's wedding is celebrated, the round dance > of the mermaids in the night's moonshine: on the nearby rocks loom proud > castles, palaces and ruins aloft. The Vltava swirls into the St John's > Rapids; then it widens and flows toward Prague, past the Vy≈°ehrad, and then > majestically vanishes into the distance, ending at the Labe (or Elbe, in > German). \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\tempo \\"Allegro commodo non agitato\\" \\\\partial 8*1 b8-.\\\\p_\\"dolce\\"  e4(\\\\< fis8) g4( a8)\\\\\\\\!  b4 b8-. b4.--\\\\<  c4.\\\\sf\\\\\\\\! c->\\\\>  b->\\\\\\\\!\\\\p~ b4 b8\\\\<(  a4.)\\\\\\\\!\\\\dim a4 a8  g4( a8 g4) g8(\\\\<  fis4.)\\\\\\\\!\\\\> fis4(\\\\\\\\!\\\\> fis8-.)\\\\\\\\!  e4\\\\> r8\\\\\\\\! } Vltava contains Smetana's most famous tune. It is an adaptation of the melody La Mantovana, attributed to the Italian renaissance tenor, Giuseppe Cenci,John Walter Hill \\"Cenci, Giuseppe\\" in Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 21 February 2010 which, in a borrowed Romanian form, was also the basis for the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah. The tune also appears in an old Czech folk song, Koƒçka leze d√≠rou (\\"The Cat Crawls Through the Hole\\"); Hanns Eisler used it for his \\"Song of the Moldau‚Äù; and Stan Getz performed it as ‚ÄúDear Old Stockholm‚Äù (probably through another derivative of the original tune, ‚ÄúAck V√§rmeland du sk√∂na‚Äù). The piece is featured in the 2011 American movie The Tree of Life.  ≈†√°rka  ≈†√°rka and Ctirad The third poem was finished on 20 February 1875 and is named for the female warrior ≈†√°rka, a central figure in the ancient Czech legend of The Maidens' War. ≈†√°rka ties herself to a tree as bait and waits to be saved by the princely knight Ctirad, deceiving him into believing that she is an unwilling captive of the rebelling women. Once released by Ctirad, who has quickly fallen in love with her, ≈†√°rka serves him and his comrades with drugged mead and once they have fallen asleep she sounds a hunting horn: an agreed signal to the other women. The poem ends with the warrior maidens falling upon and murdering the sleeping men. It was first performed under the baton of Adolf ƒåech (sources disagree whether this was on 10 December 1876 or 17 March 1877).Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra  Z ƒçesk√Ωch luh≈Ø a h√°j≈Ø  Smetana finished composing this piece, the title of which means \\"From Bohemia's woods and fields\\", on 18 October 1875 and received its first public performance nearly eight weeks later, on 10 December. A depiction of the beauty of the Czech countryside and its people, the tone poem tells no real story. The first part is dedicated to the grandeur of the forest with a surprising fugue in the strings, interrupted by a soft woodland melody of the horns, which is later taken over by the whole orchestra. In the second part, a village festival is depicted in full swing. This tone poem was originally written to be the finale of M√° vlast.  T√°bor  This piece, which was finished on 13 December 1878 and premiered on 4 January 1880, is named for the city of T√°bor in the south of Bohemia founded by the Hussites and serving as their center during the Hussite Wars. The theme for the piece is quoted from the first two lines of the Hussite hymn, \\"Kto≈æ js√∫ bo≈æ√≠ bojovn√≠ci\\" (\\"Ye Who Are Warriors of God\\"). \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/2 \\\\key d \\\\minor d\\\\ff-. d-. d2-> d->  r r d\\\\ff  e4-.-> c-. c1-> }  Blan√≠k  An army of knights led by St. Wenceslas Blan√≠k was finished on 9 March 1879 and premiered on 4 January 1880. It is named for the mountain Blan√≠k inside which a legend says that a huge army of knights led by St. Wenceslas sleep. The knights will awake and help the country in its gravest hour (sometimes described as four hostile armies attacking from all cardinal directions). Musically, Blan√≠k begins exactly as T√°bor ends, \\"hammering\\" out the motto which was left unresolved, but now continuing on, as if in the aftermath of the battle. Thus these last two tone poems of the cycle form a cohesive pair, as do the first two; the High Castle's theme returns as the Vltava's river journey triumphantly reaches that same destination, and again returns triumphantly at the end of Blan√≠k. Once again, the Hussite hymn used in T√°bor is quoted, though this time it is the third line which rings out in the march at the end of the piece. The original lyrics to this line in the hymn are \\"so that finally with Him you will always be victorious\\", a reference to the eventual victorious rise of the Czech state. \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass \\\\time 3/2 \\\\key d \\\\major d->\\\\fff d-> d2-> d->  e4-> c-> c2-> r  e4->-. c->~ c b->-. b2->  a1->\\\\fz r2  a4->\\\\sfz c-> c2-> a->  a4-> f-> f2-> }  Instrumentation  The work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, triangle, cymbals, two harps, and strings.

Despite their small size, the islands have created a large popular music industry, which gained in international renown after the success of zouk music in the later 20th century. Zouk's popularity was particularly intense in France, where the genre became an important symbol of identity for Martinique and Guadeloupe.Ledesma and Scaramuzzo, pgs. 289‚Äì303 Zouk's origins are in the folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe, especially Martinican chouval bwa, and Guadeloupan gwo ka. There's also notable influence of the pan-Caribbean calypso tradition and Haitian kompa. Folk music A band from Martinique during the 2014 Tropical Carnival of Paris Carnival is a very important festival, known as Vaval on Martinique. Music plays a vital role, with Martinican big bands marching across the island. Vaval declined following World War II, bouncing back with new band formats and new traditions only in the 1980s. Like Guadeloupe, Martinique features participatory, call- and-response style songs during its Vaval celebrations. In the early 20th century on Martinique, Creole bands travelled on trucks or small carts during Vaval, playing a music known as biguine vid√© (or just vide√©). After the decline of Vaval in World War II, the tradition began anew in the 1980s, when large marching bands of fifty or more people became common, including a number of horn players, percussionists and dancers. These large bands, known as groups √† pied, are each identified with a neighborhood. =Biguine vid√©= Biguine vid√© is an up-tempo version of the biguine rhythm, combining other carnival elements. It participatory music, with the bandleader singing a verse and the audience responding. Modern instrumentation includes a variety of improvised drums made from containers of all kinds, plastic plumbing, bells, tanbou d√©bonda, b√©l√© chacha, tibwa and b√©l√© drums. Aside from the biguine vid√© bands, Vaval includes song and costume contests, masquerading and zouk parties.Gerstin =B√©l√©= The bel air (or b√©l√©) is a legacy of the slave music tradition. The b√©l√© itself is a huge tambour drum that players ride as though it was a horse. It is characterized, in its rhythm, by the \\"tibwa\\" (two wooden sticks) played on a length of bamboo mounted on a stand to the tambour b√©l√©, and is often accompanied by a chacha (a maracas). The tibwa rhythm plays a basic pattern and the drum comes to mark the highlights and introduce percussion improvisations. It is organized in a certain way, the first entry of the singer ( lavwa ) and choir ( lavwa Deye or \\"answer\\"). Then the \\"Bwat√®\\" (player ti bwa) sets the pace, followed by b√©l√© drum. Finally, the dancers take the stage. A dialogue is created between the dancers and the \\"tanbouy√®\\" (drummer). The \\"answer\\" play opposite the singer, the audience can also participate. As a family, together singers, dancers, musicians and audiences are lured by its mesmerizing rhythms. The b√©l√© song-dances include, b√©l√© dous, b√©l√© pitj√®, biguine b√©l√©, b√©l√© belya, and gran b√©l√© The b√©l√© is the origin of several important Martiniquan popular styles, including chouval bwa and biguine, and also exerted an influence on zouk. Edmond Mondesir is a popular b√©l√© musician from Martinique. =Chouval bwa= Chouval bwa is a kind of Martinican traditional music, featuring percussion, bamboo flute, accordion, and comb and paper-type kazoo. The music originated among rural Martinicans, as a form of celebratory holiday music played to accompany a dance called the manege (which translates as merry-go-round; chouval bwa is a Creole version of cheval bois, which refers to the wooden horses seen on merry-go-rounds). Chouval bwa percussion is played by a drummer on the tanbour drum and the ti bwa, a percussion instrument made out of a piece of bamboo laid horizontally and beaten with sticks; the most traditional ensembles also use accordions, chacha (a rattle) and the bel-air, a bass version of the tanbour. =Quadrille= In French Caribbean culture, especially of the Lesser Antilles, the term kwadril is a Creole term referring to a folk dance derived from the quadrille. kwadril dances are in sets consisting of proper quadrilles, plus creolized versions of 19th-century couple dances: biguines, mazouks and valses Cr√©oles. Instrumentation consists of variable combinations of accordion, guitar, violin, tanbou dibas, chacha (either a single metal cylinder as in Martinique, or calabash without a handle, held in both hands), malakach (maracas), triangle, bwa (tibwa) and syak, a bamboo rasp one metre long, grooved on both top and bottom, held with one end on the belly and the other on a door or wall and scraped with both hands. Popular music Though Martinique and Guadeloupe are most frequently known only for the internationally renowned zouk style, the islands have also produced popular musicians in various updated styles of traditional biguine, chouval bwa and gwo ka. The world-famous zouk band Kassav' remains easily the most famous performers from the island. Chouval bwa has been popularized by Claude Germany, Tumpak, D√©d√© Saint-Prix, and Pakatak. Martinique is also the birthplace of the Gibson Brothers who achieved significant chart success worldwide, most notably with their single \\"Cuba\\". =Biguine= Biguine is a Martinican form of clarinet and trombone music which can be divided into two distinct types: *bidgin b√©l√® or drum biguine ‚Äì originates in slave b√®l√® dances and characterized by the use of b√©l√® drums and tibwa rhythm sticks, along with call and response, nasal vocals and improvised instrumental solos; has its roots in West African ritual dances, though ceremonial components do not survive in Haitian biguine. *orchestrated biguine ‚Äì originates in Saint-Pierre in the 18th century, highly influenced by French music though vocals are usually in creole. Evolving out of string band music, biguine spread to mainland France in the 1920s. Early stars like Alexandre Stellio and Sam Castandet became popular. Its popularity abroad died relatively quickly, but it lasted as a major force in popular music on Martinique until Haitian compas took over in the 1950s and mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe became popular in the late 1960s. In the later part of the 20th century, biguine musicians like clarinet virtuoso Michel Godzom helped revolutionize the genre. =Cadence (Kadans)/Compas= In the 1970s, a wave of Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans (another word named for the genre compas), a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe. Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. Gordon Henderson's Exile One innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with a full-horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav' invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like \\"Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni\\". Kassav' formed from Paris in 1978. =Mini-jazz= Mini- jazz was formed in the mid-60s characterized by the rock bands formula of two guitars, one bass, drum-conga-cowbell, some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordion or lead guitar. However, all these small jazz or bands had their guitars with sophisticated styles. The 1970s were dominated by mini-jazz, which still used a variant of the m√©ringue style. One of the mini-jazz groups, Tabou Combo, became the most popular ensemble of Haiti. From Haiti the mini-jazz formula replicated in the French Antilles in the 1970s. =Cadence-lypso= The most influential figure in the promotion of Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) that featured mostly the cadence rampa of Haiti and calypso music from the English speaking caribbean. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim. Dominica cadence music has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock and roll, soul, and funk music from the United States. By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence-lypso as \\"a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary\\". Aside from Exile One, other bands included the Grammacks, Black Roots, Black Machine, Naked Feet, Belles Combo, Mantra, Black Affairs, Liquid Ice, Wafrikai, Midnighte Groovers and Milestone, while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas, Chubby Marc, Gordon Henderson, Linford John, Janet Azouz, Sinky Rabess, Tony Valmond, Jeff Joseph, Mike Moreau, Anthony Gussie and Ophelia Marie. =Zouk= The inspiration for Zouk's style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vid√© are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk is based around star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and is based almost entirely around studio recordings. Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk's development to the Guadeloupean gwo ka and Martinican b√®l√® (tambour and ti bwa) folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence, Guadeloupean biguine.Guilbault, Jocelyn, Gage Averill, √âdouard Benoit and Gregory Rabess, Zouk: World Music in the West Indies (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), cited in Manuel, pg. 142 Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres. =Zouk-love= Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems. The music cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivative of this French Antillean compas style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genre. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa. Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha. =Bouyon (Jump up)= Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica. Bouyon was developed in the 1980s by bands like WCK, combining elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation. In Guadeloupe and Martinique, \\"Jump up\\" refers generally to bouyon music. =French Antilles hip hop= The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France. Music festivals Two large, international music festivals have further bolstered Martinique's music scene. Jazz √† la Martinique and Carrefour Mondial de Guitare alternate years. The country's best jazz musicians are featured during Jazz √† la Martinique, but major worldwide players like Branford Marsalis also perform. Honoring the guitar, Carrefour Mondial de Guitare celebrates a wide range of guitar genres, including flamenco, blues, jazz, rock, and pop. Both festivals last approximately a week, with concerts in various locations throughout Martinique. Recently, Franck Nicolas presented \\"B√©l√©-Jazz\\", a style of jazz using the b√©l√© rhythms as its basis. See also * Canboulay Notes References *Gerstin, Julian (2000). \\"French West Indies\\".

Zouk's popularity was particularly intense in France, where the genre became an important symbol of identity for Guadeloupe and Martinique.Ledesma and Scaramuzzo, pgs. 289-303 Zouk's origins are in the folk music of Guadeloupe and Martinique, especially Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican chouval bwa, and the pan-Caribbean calypso tradition. Folk music A band from Guadeloupe during the 2014 Tropical Carnival of Paris Carnival is a very important festival in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Music plays a vital role, with Guadeloupean gwo ka ensembles, zouk music and guadeloupean big bands marching across the island, and travelling and performing music known as C (or just vide√©) in a manner akin to Brazilian samba schools. Carnival in both islands declined following World War II, bouncing back with new band formats and new traditions only in the 1980s. Both islands feature participatory, call-and- response style songs during their Carnival celebrations. =Biguine vid√©= Biguine vid√© is an up tempo version of the biguine rhythm, combining other carnival elements. It is participatory music, with the bandleader singing a verse and the audience responding. It allows one to grab an improvised percussion instrument and join in. Traditionally, Carnival includes dances of African origin, including laghia, haut-taille, grage, calinda and bel-air. Traditional instruments include the chacha, tibwa, mak√©, boula, tanbou chan and tanbou bas drums. Aside from the biguine vid√© bands, Vaval includes song and costume contests, masquerading and zouk parties.Gerstin =Gwo ka= Gwo ka played in Basse-Terre. Gwo ka is a family of hand drums used to create a form of folk music from Guadeloupe. There are seven basic rhythms in gwo ka, and multiple variations on each. Different sizes of drums establish the foundation and its flourishes, with the largest, the boula, playing the central rhythm and the smaller, markeur (or mak√©) drums embellishes upon it and interplays with the dancers, audience or singer. Gwo ka singing is usually guttural, nasal and rough, though it can also be bright and smooth, and is accompanied by uplifting and complex harmonies and melodies. Rural Guadeloupans still use gwo ka drums in communal experiences called lewozes; this is the most traditional manifestation of gwo ka in modern Guadeloupe. Gwo ka is also played at Carnival and other celebrations. A modernized and popularized form of gwo ka is well-known on the islands; it is known as gwo ka moderne. =Balakadri= Guadeloupean balakadri persisted into the 20th century and, despite disruption after World War II, made a comeback in the 1980s. The Guadeloupean-administered island of Marie-Galante has also had a vital and well-documented balakadri tradition. As in Martinique (and the Creole-speaking islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica), kwadril dances are in sets consisting of proper quadrilles, plus creolized versions of 19th-century couple dances: biguines, mazouks and valses Cr√©oles.  Popular music  Though Guadeloupe and Martinique are most frequently known only for the internationally renowned zouk style, the islands have also produced popular musicians in various updated styles of traditional biguine, chouval bwa and gwo ka. The world-famous zouk band Kassav' remains easily the most famous performers from the island, while the Guadeloupan Carnival band Akiyo has become the only group in that style to record commercially. =Cadence (Kadans)/Compas= In the 1970s, a wave of Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans, a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe. Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. Gordon Henderson's Exile One innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with a full-horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav' invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like \\"Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni\\". Kassav' formed from Paris in 1978. =Mini-jazz= Mini- jazz was formed in the mid-60s characterized by the rock bands formula of two guitars, one bass, drum-conga-cowbell, some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordion or lead guitar. However, all these small jazz or bands had their guitars with sophisticated styles. The 1970s were dominated by mini-jazz, which still used a variant of the m√©ringue style. One of the mini-jazz groups, Tabou Combo, became the most popular ensemble of Haiti. From Haiti the mini-jazz formula replicated in the French Antilles in the 1970s. =Cadence-lypso= The most influential figure in the promotion of Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) that featured mostly the cadence rampa of Haiti and calypso music from the English speaking caribbean. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim. Dominica cadence music has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock and roll, soul, and funk music from the United States. By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence-lypso as \\"a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary\\". Aside from Exile One, other bands included the Grammacks, Black Roots, Black Machine, Naked Feet, Belles Combo, Mantra, Black Affairs, Liquid Ice, Wafrikai, Midnighte Groovers and Milestone, while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas, Chubby Marc, Gordon Henderson, Linford John, Janet Azouz, Sinky Rabess, Tony Valmond, Jeff Joseph, Mike Moreau, Anthony Gussie and Ophelia Marie. =Zouk= The inspiration for Zouk's style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vid√© are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk is based around star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and is based almost entirely around studio recordings. Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk's development to the Guadeloupean gwo ka and Martinican b√®l√® (tambour and ti bwa) folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyn Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence, Guadeloupean biguine.Guilbault, Jocelyn, Gage Averill, √âdouard Benoit and Gregory Rabess, Zouk: World Music in the West Indies (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), cited in Manuel, pg. 142 Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres. =Zouk-love= Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems. The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa. Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha. = Gwo ka moderne = A more modernized version of gwo ka is gwo ka moderne, which adds new instruments ranging from conga or djembe drums and chimes to electric bass guitar. At root, however, these styles all use the same fundamental seven rhythms as folk gwo ka. Zouk legends Kassav' played an important role in the modernization of gwo ka, giving urban credibility to a style that was seen as backward and unsophisticated; they initially played in a gro ka format, using songs from the gwo ka Carnival tradition of mas a St. Jean and even placing an homage to traditionalist drumming legend Velo on their earlier albums. Gwo ka moderne artists include Pakala Percussion, Van L√©v√© and Poukoutan'n, alongside more pop-influenced musicians like Marcel Magnat and Ti Celeste, while Gerard Hubert and others have fused gwo ka with zouk. The most famous modern gwo ka performer, however, is William Flessel, whose Message Ka in 1994 became an international hit. =Bouyon gwada= Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting with a fusion of cadence-lypso, jing ping and other traditional dances. Due to the popularity of Triple K International, Ncore, and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the French Antilles, a popular offshoot of bouyon from Guadeloupe is call bouyon gwada. The jump up had its heyday from the 90s with songs such as Met Veye WCK, but remained stamped background music or carnival. Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and \\"Big Ting Poppin 'Daly alone. A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is call bouyon hardcore, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc. =French Antilles hip hop= The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France.' Sidney Duteil (born Patrick Duteil in 1955 in Argenteuil, Val-d'Oise), better known as Sidney, is a French musician, rapper, DJ, television and radio host, and occasional actor of Guadeloupean origin. He is well known in France for his connection with the beginnings of the French hip hop scene.

His scores, now numbering over one hundred, have won him the Pulitzer Prize, five Grammy Awards, Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition, and an Oscar. He is a distinguished professor of music at Lehman College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and on the composition faculty at the Juilliard School. Biography =Before 1964= The Italian- American Corigliano was born in New York City to a musical family. His father, John Paul Corigliano Sr., was concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic for 23 years, and his mother, Rose Buzen, is an accomplished educator and pianist. Corigliano attended P.S. 241 and Midwood High School in Brooklyn. He studied composition at Columbia University (BA 1959) and at the Manhattan School of Music. He studied with Otto Luening, Vittorio Giannini, and Paul Creston. Before achieving success as a composer, Corigliano worked as assistant to the producer on the Leonard Bernstein Young People's Concerts and as a session producer for classical artists such as Andr√© Watts. He was also music director for New York's listener-sponsored radio station WBAI. =1964‚Äì1987= Corigliano first came to prominence in 1964 at the age of 26 when his Sonata for Violin and Piano (1963) was the only winner of the chamber-music competition of the Spoleto Festival in Italy. In 1970, Corigliano teamed up with David Hess to create The Naked Carmen. In a recent communication with David Hess, Hess acknowledged that The Naked Carmen was originally conceived by Corigliano and himself as a way to update the most popular opera of our time (Carmen). Mercury Records wanted the classical and popular divisions to work together and after a meeting with Joe Bott, Scott Mampe and Bob Reno, it was decided to proceed with the project. In Hess's own words, the project was \\"a collective decision\\". After he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, Corigliano began teaching at the Manhattan School of Music and became a music faculty member at Lehman College. He credits his first two concerti for solo wind for both changing his art and his career. It was during the composition of his Oboe Concerto (1975) and especially his Clarinet Concerto (1977) that he first used an \\"architectural\\" method of composing. In 1974, he wrote his first film score for the documentary A Williamsburg Sampler. He later wrote the score for Altered States (1980) and his third film score for Revolution (1985). The award-winning score for Revolution is one of Corigliano's most impressive creations, although it is less known, as it was never released in any recorded format; it has existed in a bootleg form until Var√®se Sarabande officially released the score for a limited time in December 2009 through their CD club, and then as a regular release in 2010. Corigliano later used portions of the score in his first symphony. For flutist James Galway, he composed his third wind concerto, titled Pied Piper Fantasy, which premiered with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1982). In 1984, he became Distinguished Professor of Music at Lehman College and left his position at Manhattan School of Music in 1986. =1987‚Äìpresent= In 1987, Corigliano was the first composer ever to serve as Composer-in-Residence for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. During his residency, he composed his first symphony, which was inspired by the AIDS epidemic and to honor the friends he lost. His first symphony won him the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1991 and his first Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 1992. Corigliano's first and only opera, The Ghosts of Versailles, was the Metropolitan Opera's first commission in nearly three decades, celebrating the company's 100th anniversary. The opera was a huge success at the premiere and received the International Classic Music Awards Composition of the Year award in 1992. In 1991, Corigliano became faculty member at the Juilliard School. In 1995, he was commissioned to write String Quartet (1995) by Lincoln Center for the Cleveland Quartet, which won him his second Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition. Corigliano's fourth film score was for Fran√ßois Girard's The Red Violin (1997) which won him his second Academy Award nomination and the 1999 Oscar for best film score. Portions of the score were used in his violin concerto (2003), written for Joshua Bell, who premiered it on September 19, 2003 with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In 2001, he received the Pulitzer Prize for his Symphony No. 2 (2001). In 2011, Corigliano's song cycle One Sweet Morning premiered at Avery Fisher Hall by mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe and the New York Philharmonic, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Other important commissions have been Chiaroscuro (1997) for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart for The Dranoff International Two Piano Foundation, Vocalise (1999) for the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Poems of Bob Dylan (2003) which earned him his third Grammy Award, Symphony No. 3 Circus Maximus (2004) for the University of Texas Wind Ensemble, STOMP (2011) written for the 2011 Tchaikovsky Competition in Russia, and Conjurer (2008) commissioned by an international consortium of six orchestras for Evelyn Glennie and winning him his fifth Grammy Award. Among Corigliano's students are David Sampson, Eric Whitacre, Elliot Goldenthal, Edward Knight, Nico Muhly, Roger Bergs, Gary Kulesha, Scott Glasgow, John Mackey, Michael Bacon, Avner Dorman, Mason Bates, Steven Bryant, Jefferson Friedman, Jamie Howarth, Dinuk Wijeratne and David Ludwig. In 1996, The Corigliano Quartet was founded, taking his name in tribute. Music Most of Corigliano's work has been for symphony orchestra. He employs a wide variety of styles, sometimes even within the same work, but aims to make his work accessible to a relatively large audience. Many of his works have been performed and recorded by some of the most prominent orchestras, soloists, and chamber musicians in the world. He has written symphonies, as well as works for string orchestra, wind band, concerti, chamber and solo pieces, opera, as well as for film. Corigliano's most distinguished works include his Clarinet Concerto (1977), Symphony No. 1 (1988), The Ghosts of Versailles (1991), Symphony No. 2 for string orchestra (2000), Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Poems of Bob Dylan (2000), and his score for the film The Red Violin (1998).

The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from essentially indigenous genres like bomba to recent hybrids like Latin trap and reggaeton. Broadly conceived, the realm of \\"Puerto Rican music\\" should naturally comprise the music culture of the millions of people of Puerto Rican descent who have lived in the United States, and especially in New York City. Their music, from salsa to the boleros of Rafael Hern√°ndez, cannot be separated from the music culture of Puerto Rico itself. Traditional, folk and popular music The Museum of Puerto Rican Music in Ponce =Early music= Music culture in Puerto Rico during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries is poorly documented. Certainly it included Spanish church music, military band music, and diverse genres of dance music cultivated by the j√≠baros and enslaved Africans and their descendants. While these later never constituted more than 11% of the island's population, they contributed some of the island's most dynamic musical features becoming distinct indeed. In the 19th century Puerto Rican music begins to emerge into historical daylight, with notated genres like danza being naturally better documented than folk genres like j√≠baro music and bomba y plena and seis. The African people of the island used drums made of carved hardwood covered with untreated rawhide on one side, commonly made from goatskin. A popular word derived from creole to describe this drum was shukbwa, that literally means 'trunk of tree' =Folk music= If the term \\"folk music\\" is taken to mean music genres that have flourished without elite support, and have evolved independently of the commercial mass media, the realm of Puerto Rican folk music would comprise the primarily Hispanic-derived j√≠baro music, the Afro-Puerto Rican bomba, and the essentially \\"creole\\" plena. As these three genres evolved in Puerto Rico and are unique to that island, they occupy a respected place in island culture, even if they are not currently as popular as contemporary musics like salsa or reggaeton. J√≠baro music Tiple Requinto (1880) from Puerto Rico J√≠baros are small farmers of primarily Hispanic descent who constituted the overwhelming majority of the Puerto Rican population until the mid-twentieth century. They are traditionally recognized as romantic icons of land cultivation, hard working, self-sufficient, hospitable, and with an innate love of song and dance. Their instrumentsMuseo de la M√∫sica Puertorrique√±a. EyeTour.com Video Guide. Ponce, Puerto Rico. Accessed 26 October 2015. were relatives of the Spanish vihuela, especially the cuatro ‚Äî which evolved from four single strings to five pairs of double strings ‚ÄîThe cuatros: El Proyecto del Cuatro. Cuatro-pr.org Accessed 26 October 2015. and the lesser known tiple.The Instruments: El Proyecto del Cuatro. The Cuatro Project. Cuatro-pr.org Accessed 26 October 2015. A typical j√≠baro group nowadays might feature a cuatro, guitar, and percussion instrument such as the g√ºiro scraper and/or bongo. Lyrics to j√≠baro music are generally in the d√©cima form, consisting of ten octosyllabic lines in the rhyme scheme abba, accddc. D√©cima form derives from 16th century Spain. Although it has largely died out in that country (except the Canaries), it took root in various places in Latin America‚Äîespecially Cuba and Puerto Rico‚Äîwhere it is sung in diverse styles. A sung d√©cima might be pre-composed, derived from a publication by some literati, or ideally, improvised on the spot, especially in the form of a ‚Äúcontroversia‚Äù in which two singer-poets trade witty insults or argue on some topic. In between the d√©cimas, lively improvisations can be played on the cuatro. This music form is also known as \\"t√≠pica\\" as well as \\"tr√≥pica\\". The d√©cimas are sung to stock melodies, with standardized cuatro accompaniment patterns. About twenty such song-types are in common use. These are grouped into two broad categories, viz., seis (e.g., seis fajarde√±o, seis chorreao) and aguinaldo (e.g., aguinaldo orocove√±o, aguinaldo cayeyano). Traditionally, the seis could accompany dancing, but this tradition has largely died out except in tourist shows and festivals. The aguinaldo is most characteristically sung during the Christmas season, when groups of revelers (parrandas) go from house to house, singing j√≠baro songs and partying. The aguinaldo texts are generally not about Christmas, and also unlike Anglo- American Christmas carols, they are generally sung by a solo with the other revelers singing chorus. In general, Christmas season is a time when traditional music‚Äîboth seis and aguinaldo‚Äîis most likely to be heard. Fortunately, many groups of Puerto Ricans are dedicated to preserving traditional music by continued practice. J√≠baro music came to be marketed on commercial recordings in the twentieth century, and singer-poets like Ramito (Flor Morales Ramos, 1915‚Äì90) are well documented. However, j√≠baros themselves were becoming an endangered species, as agribusiness and urbanization have drastically reduced the numbers of small farmers on the island. Many j√≠baro songs dealt accordingly with the vicissitudes of migration to New York. J√≠baro music has in general declined accordingly, although it retains its place in local culture, especially around Christmas time and special social gatherings, and there are many cuatro players, some of whom have cultivated prodigious virtuosity. Bomba Historical references indicate that by the decades around 1800 plantation slaves were cultivating a music and dance genre called bomba. By the mid-twentieth century, when it started to be recorded and filmed, bomba was performed in regional variants in various parts of the island, especially Lo√≠za, Ponce, San Juan, and Mayag√ºez. It is not possible to reconstruct the history of bomba; various aspects reflect Congolese derivation, though some elements (as suggested by subgenre names like holand√©s) have clearly come from elsewhere in the Caribbean. French Caribbean elements are particularly evident in the bomba style of Mayag√ºez, and striking choreographic parallels can be seen with the b√©l√© of Martinique. All of these sources were blended into a unique sound that reflects the life of the Jibaro, the slaves, and the culture of Puerto Rico. In its call-and-response singing set to ostinato-based rhythms played on two or three squat drums (barriles), bomba resembles other neo-African genres in the Caribbean. Of clear African provenance is its format in which a single person emerges from an informal circle of singers to dance in front of the drummers, engaging the lead drummer in a sort of playful duel; after dancing for a while, that person is then replaced by another. While various such elements can be traced to origins in Africa or elsewhere, bomba must be regarded as a local Afro-Puerto Rican creation. Its rhythms (e.g. seis corrido, yub√°, ler√≥, etc.), dance moves, and song lyrics that sometimes mimic farm animals(in Spanish, with some French creole words in eastern Puerto Rico) collectively constitute a unique Puerto Rican genre. In the 1950s, the dance-band ensemble of Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera performed several songs which they labelled as \\"bombas\\"; although these bore some similarities to the sic√° style of bomba, in their rhythms and horn arrangements they also borrowed noticeably from the Cuban dance music which had long been popular in the island. Giving rise to Charanga music. As of the 1980s, bomba had declined, although it was taught, in a somewhat formalized fashion, by the Cepeda family in Santurce, San Juan, and was still actively performed informally, though with much vigor, in the Lo√≠za towns, home to then Ayala family dynasty of bomberos. Bomba continues to survive there, and has also experienced something of a revival, being cultivated by folkloric groups such as Son Del Batey, Los Rebuleadores de San Juan, Bomba Evoluci√≥n, Abrane y La Tribu and many more else where in the island. In New York City with groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21, members of La Casita de Chema, and Alma Moyo. In Chicago Buya, and Afro Caribe have kept the tradition alive and evolving. In California Bomba Liberte, Grupo Aguacero, Bombalele, La Mixta Criolla, Herencia de los Carrillo, and Los Bomberas de la Bahia are all groups that have promoted and preserved the culture. Women have also played a role in its revival, as in the case of the all-female group Yaya, Legacy Woman, Los Bomberas de la Bahia, Grupo Bambula (Originally female group) and Ausuba in Puerto Rico. There has also been a strong commitment towards Bomba Fusion. Groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21, and Viento De Agua have contributed greatly towards fusing Bomba and Plena with Jazz and other Genres. Yerbabuena has brought a popular cross over appeal. Abrante y La Tribu have made fusions with Hip Hop. Tambores Calientes, Machete Movement, and Ceiba have fused the genres with various forms of Rock and Roll. The Afro- Puerto Rican bombas, developed in the sugarcane haciendas of Lo√≠za, the northeastern coastal areas, in Guayama and in southern Puerto Rico, utilize barrel drums and tambourines, while the rural version uses stringed instruments to produce music, relating to the bongos. (1) ‚ÄúThe bomba is danced in pairs, but there is no contact. The dancers each challenge the drums and musicians with their movements by approaching them and performing a series of fast steps called floretea piquetes, creating a rhythmic discourse. Unlike normal dance routines, the drummers are the ones who follow the performers, and create a beat or rhythm based on their movements. Women who dance bomba often use dresses or scarfs to enhance bodily movements.Dance of Puerto Rico. Caribya! Accessed 14 May 2018 Unlike normal dance terms, the instruments follow the performer. Like other such traditions, bomba is now well documented on sites like YouTube, and on a few ethnographic documentary films. Plena Puerto Rican G√ºiro Around 1900 plena emerged as a humble proletarian folk genre in the lower-class, largely Afro-Puerto Rican urban neighborhoods in San Juan, Ponce, and elsewhere. Plena subsequently came to occupy its niche in island music culture. In its quintessential form, plena is an informal, unpretentious, simple folk-song genre, in which alternating verses and refrains are sung to the accompaniment of round, often homemade frame drums called panderetas (like tambourines without jingles), perhaps supplemented by accordion, guitar, or whatever other instruments might be handy. An advantage of the percussion arrangement is its portability, contributing to the plena's spontaneous appearance at social gatherings. Other instruments commonly heard in plena music are the cuatro, the maracas, and accordions. The plena rhythm is a simple duple pattern, although a lead pandereta player might add lively syncopations. Plena melodies tend to have an unpretentious, \\"folksy\\" simplicity. Some early plena verses commented on barrio anecdotes, such as \\"Cortar√≥n Elena\\" (They stabbed Elena) or \\"All√≠ vienen las maquinas\\" (Here come the firetrucks). Many had a decidedly irreverent and satirical flavor, such as \\"Lleg√≥ el obispo\\" mocking a visiting bishop. Some plenas, such as \\"Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres\\" and \\"Santa Mar√≠a,\\" are familiar throughout the island. In 1935 the essayist Tom√°s Blanco celebrated plena‚Äîrather than the outdated and elitist danza‚Äîas an expression of the island's fundamentally creole, Taino or mulatto racial and cultural character. Plenas are still commonly performed in various contexts; a group of friends attending a parade or festival may bring a few panderetas and burst into song, or new words will be fitted to the familiar tunes by protesting students or striking workers which has long been a regular form of protest from occupation and slavery. While enthusiasts might on occasion dance to a plena, plena is not characteristically oriented toward dance. In the 1920s‚Äì30s plenas came to be commercially recorded, especially by Manuel \\"El Canario\\" Jimenez, who performed old and new songs, supplementing the traditional instruments with piano and horn arrangements. In the 1940s Cesar Concepci√≥n popularized a big-band version of plena, lending the genre a new prestige, to some extent at the expense of its proletarian vigor and sauciness. In the 1950s a newly envigorated plena emerged as performed by the smaller band of Rafael Cortijo and vocalist Ismael \\"Maelo\\" Rivera, attaining unprecedented popularity and modernizing the plena while recapturing its earthy vitality. Many of Cortijo's plenas present colorful and evocative vignettes of barrio life and lent a new sort of recognition to the dynamic contribution of Afro-Puerto Ricans to the island's culture (and especially music). This period represented the apogee of plena's popularity as a commercial popular music. Unfortunately, Rivera spent much of the 1960s in prison, and the group never regained its former vigor. Nevertheless, the extraordinary massive turnout for Cortijo's funeral in 1981 reflected the beloved singer's enduring popularity. By then, however, plena's popularity had been replaced by that of salsa, although some revivalist groups, such as Plena Libre, continue to perform in their own lively fashion, while \\"street\\" plena is also heard on various occasions. =Danza= Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez By the late 1700s the country dance (French contredanse, Spanish contradanza) had come to thrive as a popular recreational dance, both in courtly and festive vernacular forms, throughout much of Europe, replacing dances such as the minuet. By 1800 a creolized form of the genre, called contradanza, was thriving in Cuba, and the genre also appears to have been extant, in similar vernacular forms, in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and elsewhere, although documentation is scanty. By the 1850s, the Cuban contradanza‚Äîincreasingly referred to as danza‚Äîwas flourishing both as a salon piano piece, or as a dance-band item to accompany social dancing, in a style evolving from collective figure dancing (like a square dance) to independent couples dancing ballroom-style (like a waltz, but in duple rather than ternary rhythm). According to local chroniclers, in 1845 a ship arrived from Havana, bearing, among other things, a party of youths who popularized a new style of contradanza/danza, confusingly called \\"merengue.\\" This style subsequently became wildly popular in Puerto Rico, to the extent that in 1848 it was banned by the priggish Spanish governor Juan de la Pezuela. This prohibition, however, does not seem to have had much lasting effect, and the newly invigorated genre‚Äînow more commonly referred to as \\"danza\\"‚Äîwent on to flourish in distinctly local forms. As in Cuba, these forms included the musics played by dance ensembles as well as sophisticated light-classical items for solo piano (some of which could subsequently be interpreted by dance bands). The danza as a solo piano idiom reached its greatest heights in the music of Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez (1843‚Äì83), whose compositions have a grace and grandeur closely resembling the music of Chopin, his model. Achieving greater popularity were the numerous danzas of his follower, Juan Morel Campos (1857‚Äì96), a bandleader and extraordinarily prolific composer who, like Tav√°rez, died in his youthful prime (but not before having composed over 300 danzas). By Morel Campos' time, the Puerto Rican danza had evolved into a form quite distinct from that of its Cuban (not to mention European) counterparts. Particularly distinctive was its form consisting of an initial paseo, followed by two or three sections (sometimes called \\"merengues\\"), which might feature an arpeggio-laden \\"obbligato\\" melody played on the tuba-like bombardino (euphonium). Many danzas achieved island-wide popularity, including the piece \\"La Borinque√±a\\", which is the national anthem of Puerto Rico. Like other Caribbean creole genres such as the Cuban danz√≥n, the danzas featured the insistent ostinato called \\"cinquillo\\" (roughly, ONE-two-THREE-FOUR-five-SIX- SEVEN-eight, repeated). The danza remained vital until the 1920s, but after that decade its appeal came to be limited to the Hispanophilic elite. The danzas of Morel Campos, Tav√°rez, Jos√© Quint√≥n, and a few others are still performed and heard on various occasions, and a few more recent composers have penned their own idiosyncratic forms of danzas, but the genre is no longer a popular social dance idiom. During the first part of dancing danza, to the steady tempo of the music, the couples promenade around the room; during the second, with a lively rhythm, they dance in a closed ballroom position and the orchestra would begin by leading dancers in a \\"paseo,\\" an elegant walk around the ballroom, giving gentlemen the opportunity to show off their lady's grace and beauty. This romantic introduction ended with a salute by the gentlemen and a curtsey from the ladies in reply. Then, the orchestra would strike up and the couples would dance freely around the ballroom to the rhythm of the music. =Puerto Rican pop= Much music in Puerto Rico falls outside the standard categories of \\"Latin music\\" and is better regarded as constituting varieties of \\"Latin world pop.\\" This category includes, for example, Ricky Martin (who had a #1 Hot 100 hit in the U.S. with \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" in 1999), the boy-band Menudo (with its changing personnel), Los Chicos, Las Cheris, Salsa Kids and Chayanne. Famous singers include the Despacito singer Luis Fonsi. Above all, singer and virtuoso guitarist Jose Feliciano born in Lares, Puerto Rico, became a world pop star in 1968 when his Latin-soul version of \\"Light My Fire\\" and the LP Feliciano! became great successes in the American and international rankings and allowed Feliciano to be the first Puerto Rican to win Grammy awards that year. =Reggaeton= Puerto Rico is perhaps the single biggest center for production of reggaeton. The roots of reggaet√≥n lie in the 1980s \\"reggae en espa√±ol\\" of the Panamanian artist El General and certain songs by Puerto Rican rapper Vico C. In the early 1990s reggaeton coalesced as a more definitive genre, using the \\"Dem Bow\\" riddim derived from a Shabba Ranks song by that name, and further resembling Jamaican dancehall in its verses sung in simple tunes and stentorian style, and its emphasis‚Äîvia lyrics, videos, and artist personas‚Äîon partying, dancing, boasting, \\"bling,\\" and sexuality rather than weighty social commentary. While reggaeton may have commenced as a Spanish-language version of Jamaican dancehall, in the hands of performers like Tego Calder√≥n, Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and others, it soon acquired its own distinctive flavor and today might be considered the most popular dance music in the Spanish Caribbean, surpassing even salsa. Reggaet√≥n is a genre of music, significantly blown up in Puerto Rico and across the world, that combines Latin rhythms, dancehall, and hip-hop and/or rap. Reggaet√≥n is frequently affiliated with ‚Äúmachismo‚Äù characteristics, strong or aggressive masculine pride. Since women have joined this genre of music they've been underrepresented and have been fighting to change its image. This inevitably is causing controversy between what the genre was and what it is now. Reggaet√≥n has transformed from being a musical expression with Jamaican and Panamanian roots to being ‚Äúdembow‚Äù a newer style that has changed the game, which is listened to mainly in the Dominican Republic. Despite its success, its constant reputation highlights sexuality in the dancing, its explicit lyrics that have women screaming sexualized phrases in the background, and clothing women are presented in. In the '90s and early 2000s Reggaet√≥n had been targeted and censored in many Latin American countries for its ranchyness nature and truths. Censorship can be seen as the government's way of suppressing the people and ensuring that communication isn't strong amongst the community. Since then, many women have joined Reggaet√≥n in hopes of changing the preconceptions. Many of them have paved the way and have successful careers such as Karol G, and Natti Natasha and others. Ivy Queen Ivy Queen was born as Martha Ivelisse Pesante on March 4, 1972, in Afiasco, Puerto Rico. After writing raps during her youth and competing in an underground nightclub called The Noise, it led to the beginning of her musical career. Many consider her as the ‚ÄúQueen of Reggaeton.‚Äùhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2018/12/04/a-reggaeton- pioneer-ivy-queen-speaks- on-latin-hip-hop-history/#21fec27b3e6a In the beginning of her career, it was very difficult for her to be taken seriously in the reggaeton industry because this genre of music is seen as misogynistic. Recently, there has been controversy regarding how big her female influence has been on the genre. Another reggaeton artist, Anuel AA, questioned her place as the ‚ÄúQueen of Reggaeton‚Äù since she had not had a hit in seven years. He also insinuated that his girlfriend, Karol G, should be the queen of reggaeton. Ivy Queen responded saying her career paved the way for female artists to thrive in this genre. Ivy Queen has had influence on other women like Cardi B and Farina. Even men, such as Bad Bunny, have listed her as an influence for their lyrics. Her ability to compete amongst men who dominated Reggaet√≥n gave hope to other women who had similar interest in the music industry. Her influence and her dominance in the genre has helped other women be able to break through in the reggaet√≥n scene and sparked a place for women empowerment not only for Puerto Rican artist, but for other Latinas who are newer to the game such as Karol G and Natti Natasha, leaving Ivy Queen to crown herself with the title ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äù. Karol G is a Colombian reggaeton singer who has done collaborations with other reggaeton singers, such as J Balvin, Bad Bunny, and Maluma. Throughout her career, Karol G has had troubles in the industry because reggaeton is a genre that is dominated by males. She recounts how when starting her career she noticed that there weren't many opportunities for her in the genre because reggaeton was dominated by male artists. In 2018, Karol G's single \\"Mi Cama\\" became very popular and she made a remix with J Balvin and Nicky Jam. The Mi cama remix appeared in the top 10 Hot Latin Songs and number 1 in Latin Airplay charts. This year she has collaborated with Maluma on her song \\"Creeme\\" and with Anuel AA in the song \\"Culpables\\". The single, \\"Culpables\\" has been in the top 10 Hot Latin Songs for 2 consecutive weeks. On May 3, 2019 Karol G was able to release her new album called Ocean. Natti Natasha is a Dominican reggaeton singer who has also joined the reggeaton industry and has listed Ivy Queen as one of her influences for her music. In 2017 she made a single called \\"Criminal\\" that features reggaeton artist, Ozuna. Her single \\"Criminal\\" became very popular on YouTube with more than has 1.5 billion views. In 2018 Natti Natasha collaborated with RKM and Ken Y in their single \\"Tonta\\". She later also collaborated with Becky G in ‚ÄúSin Pijama‚Äù which made it to the top 10 in Hot Latin songs, Latin Airplay, and Latin Pop Airplay charts. After all the collaborations that Natti Natasha has done she was able to release her album called illumiNatti on February 15, 2019. Caribbean influences = Bolero = The bolero originally derived from Cuba, but by the 1920s it was being both enjoyed as well as composed and performed by Puerto Ricans, including such outstanding figures as Rafael Hern√°ndez and Pedro Flores. There are no distinctively \\"Puerto Rican\\" features‚Äîsuch as singing \\"lelolai\\" or playing the cuatro‚Äîin their boleros, but it would be pointless to go on regarding the bolero solely as a \\"Cuban\\" genre; it is, of course, a Cuban genre, but since the 1920s it has also been an international genre, including a Puerto Rican one. The main differences are found in the musical arrangements and subject matter. = Merengue = In the 1990s the most popular dance music in the island was merengue, as performed by visiting Dominican bands and a few locals such as Olga Ta√±on. Similar disagreements have been voiced about local rock bands, such as Fiel a la Vega, Puya, and Konfrontazion, that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, and which continue to be very popular. The choreography of the ballroom merengue is a basic side two-step, but with a difficult twist of the hip to the right, which makes it somewhat hard to perform. The two dance partners get into a vals, or waltz-like position. The couple then side steps, which is known as a paso de la empalizada or \\"stick-fence step,\\" followed by either a clockwise or counter-clockwise turn. During all of the dance steps of the ballroom merengue, the couple never separates. The second kind of merengue is called the Figure Meringue or Merengue de Figura, and the performing couple makes individual turns without releasing the hands of the partner and still keeping the rhythm of the beat. = Guaracha and salsa = The timbales of Tito Puente on exhibit in the Musical Instruments Museum in Phoenix, AZ Salsa is another genre whose form derived from the Cuban/Puerto Rican melding of genre, especially Cuban dance music of the 1950s‚Äîbut which in the 1960s-70s became an international genre, cultivated with special zeal and excellence in Puerto Rico and by Puerto Ricans in New York City. Forms such as the Charanga were hugely popular with Puerto Ricans and Nuyoricans who, in effect, rescued this genre which had been stagnating and limited to only Cuba in the 1960s, giving it new life, new social significance, and many new stylistic innovations. Salsa is the name acquired by the modernized form of Cuban/Puerto Rican-style dance music that was cultivated and rearticulated starting in the late 1960s by Puerto Ricans in New York City and, subsequently, in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. While salsa soon became an international phenomenon, thriving in Colombia, Venezuela, and elsewhere, New York and Puerto Rico remained its two epicenters. Particularly prominent in the island were El Gran Combo, Sonora Ponce√±a, and Willie Rosario, as well as the more pop-oriented \\"salsa rom√°ntica\\" stars of the 1980s-90s. (For further information see the entry on \\"salsa music.\\") Other popular Nuyorican and Puerto Rican exposers of these genres have been Tito Puente, Tito Rodr√≠guez (guaracha and bolero singer), pianists Eddie Palmieri, Richie Ray and Papo Lucca, conguero Ray Barreto, trombonist and singer Willie Col√≥n, and singers La India, Andy Monta√±ez, Bobby Cruz, Cheo Feliciano, H√©ctor Lavoe, Ismael Miranda, Ismael Rivera, Tito Nieves, Pete El Conde Rodr√≠guez and Gilberto Santa Rosa. Classical music The island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarm√≥nica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, attracting classical musicians from around the world. Since the nineteenth century there have been diverse Puerto Rican composers, including Felipe Gutierrez Espinosa, Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez, Juan Morel Campos, Aristides Chavier, Julio C. Arteaga, and Braulio Due√±o Col√≥n. At the beginning of the 20th century we find Jos√© Ignacio Quint√≥n, Monsita Ferrer and Jos√© Enrique Pedreira. Moving to the mid-20th century a new wave of composers appeared, some of them with a significant degree of nationalism. In this group are Amaury Veray, H√©ctor Campos Parsi, Jack Delano and Luis Antonio Ram√≠rez. With more contemporary languages come to the musical scene Rafael Aponte Led and Luis Manuel √Ålvarez. From the 1970s on, a fair number of musicians add to the list and, though with different styles, they all had an imposing international flavor. Ernesto Cordero, Carlos Alberto V√°zquez, Alfonso Fuentes, Raymond Torres-Santos, Alberto Rodr√≠guez, William Ortiz-Alvarado, Jos√© Javier Pe√±a Aguayo, Carlos Carrillo and Roberto Sierra belong to this group.  Hip-Hop  As social conditions and urban decay took its toll in the projects New York City during the 1970s, blacks and Puerto Ricans were equally affected. As a way of coping with the disarray that was taking place in New York, both Puerto Ricans and blacks worked together to collaborate on rap music that would help express their creative art. As Deborah Pacini Hernandez wrote in her article, \\"Oye Como Va! Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music,\\" many of the ways that blacks and Puerto Ricans coped with their struggles was through, \\"graffiti, DJing, emceeing, break dancing, and fashion‚Äîthe cultural elements comprising hip-hop.\\" (56) As hip-hop music rose to prominence, it was clear that Puerto Ricans had an influence on the hip-hop industry, from the break dancing to the sound of the music. > \\"To speak of Puerto Ricans in rap means to defy the sense of instant amnesia > that engulfs popular cultural expression once it is caught up in the logic > of commercial representation.

Instead of switching genres, they had to find other ways to mask their cultural identities. For example, DJ Charlie Chase was one of the first Puerto Rican artists to burst onto the scene with his group, the Cold Crush Brothers, but was the only person in the original group who wasn't black. He said that he knew he had to change his name because if he went out to perform as Carlos Mendes, he might not have gotten the credit or attention that he deserved. However, rappers such as DJ Charlie Chase set the scene for more mainstream success in the future. Because of the development of Puerto Ricans in hip-hop, artists like Big Pun, Daddy Yankee, Fat Joe, Swizz Beats, Young MA, Calle 13 (band) have become more successful. Lin-Manuel Miranda achieved universal acclaim with his opera-musical Hamilton (musical), which blends rap and classical influences.  Dance  Puerto Rican children dancing at Plaza Las Delicias during the March 2008 Ponce Crafts Festival Dance is a performing art related to expressing one's ideas and values. The activity is associated with exercise because of the required movements required to execute specific dance patterns. In Puerto Rico, dance is considered to be a part of the culture that is passed on from generation to generation and practiced at family and community parties and celebrations. = Historical influences = Dance has been influenced by the different cultures of the Ta√≠no natives, the Spaniards, and the African slaves. Since pre-Columbian times, dance has always been part of the culture of Puerto Rico and has evolved according to the social and demographic changes. The earliest dances documented by the early historians were the Ta√≠no areyto dances that were chanted by a chorus, set to music, and led by a guide. They practiced storytelling while the guide indicated the steps and songs that were to be repeated until the story was finished. Dances of European origin also became popular among the country folk and the settlers of the central part of the island and rapidly acquired unique features of rhythm, instrumentation, interpretation, and even fashion. As the population of the Ta√≠no dwindled, Spanish, African and, from 1898 on, North American dances appeared on the island and took root and developed in the mountains, on the coast, and in th√© cities.Meet Puerto Rico. www.meetpuertorico.com Accessed 14 May 2018 After the island was taken over by Spain, the music and the dance of Puerto Rico consisted of a combination of the harmonious musical styles that are borrowed from Spanish, African, and other European cultures, creating Puerto Rico's signature style of Latin dance. = Salsa = It refers to the mixture of different rhythms composed of different Latin, African, and Caribbean dances. Salsa is said to be first created around the 1960s and became popular to the non-Latino world drastically. The salsa dance is similar to the mambo dance. Salsa dancing is structured in six step patterns phrased on 8 counts of the music. The 8 different steps include 6 moves with 2 pauses. The pattern of the dance is 1,2,3 and pause for 4, move for 5,6,7 and pause for 8. The basic steps are (1) the forward and backward: in this step consist of two rock steps going in and out of the moves. The second step is known as the basic side dance step, it is similar to the first step except for this step, the moves are towards the side. The side to side feels and turns are of the significant aspects of the salsa dance. = Cha Cha Ch√° = The Cha Cha Ch√° dance originated in Cuba. Before the dance begins, one know how to count the Cha Cha Ch√°. The following are the first basic steps: (1) Count the Cha Cha Ch√° in \\"rock step, triple step and then rock step\\". (2) Eventually, count to three \\"1,2,3 Cha Cha Ch√°\\", which brings to the three full beats and two half beats of the dance. The second category is known as the Cha Cha Ch√° side basic, the most often used basic move of the dance. It is similar to the previous one except for the triple step to the side rather than in place. The third step is known as the \\"underarm in Cha Cha Ch√°\\" ans shows how to do the lady's underarm steps to the right. Based on the previous step, men might not struggle, but women must know the exact turning spot. The dance is named after the scraping sounds that are produced by the feet of the dancers.

Cultural history of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico ","title":"Music of Puerto Rico"},{"id":"242989","text":"The music of the Bahamas is associated primarily with Junkanoo, a celebration which occurs on Boxing Day and again on New Year's Day. Parades and other celebrations mark the ceremony. Groups like The Baha Men, Ronnie Butler and Kirkland Bodie have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and other places. Other popular Bahamian artists include Stileet and Stevie S.  Calypso  Calypso is a style of Afro-Caribbean music which originated in Trinidad and Tobago. This form of music has spread through many parts of the Caribbean, including The Bahamas.  Soca  Soca is a form of dance music which originated from many calypso music in Trinidad and Tobago. It originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent percussion (which is often electronic in recent music) and local chutney music. Soca music has evolved in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from various Anglophone Caribbean countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, United States Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica and Belize.  Junkanoo  Nassau The word Junkanoo is said to be derived from a Ghanaian leader, John Connu, or from the Qujo supreme deity (Canno) and ancestral spirits (jannanin). The junkanoo was formerly practiced in North Carolina and remnants still exist in Belize. It is most well known, though, from Nassau and Freeport. Since the 1950s the influence of American culture has increased, mainly through TV and radio broadcasts from Florida stations, and other Caribbean styles have made inroads: calypso, reggae and soca, from Jamaica, Cuba, Trinidad, and other islands. Tourism has also had an impact, bringing in Japanese, European and North Americans with their attendant forms of cultural expression. In this milieu more traditional Bahamas performers such as Joseph Spence, have still enjoyed successful careers playing junkanoo, Christian hymns and the ant'ems of the local sponge fishermen, which include \\"Sloop John B\\", later made famous by The Beach Boys. Junkane. Junkanoo celebration in Nassau in 2003 In 1973, the year the Bahamas achieved independence from the United Kingdom, black professionals of the middle and upper classes began to dominate junkanoo celebrations. Costuming and competitions became more complex and commonplace, and soon became a tourist draw. Aside from being a type of drum, goombay is also a percussion music made famous by Alphonso 'Blind Blake' Higgs, who played to tourists arriving at Nassau International Airport for several years. Rake-and-scrape music is a unique type of instrumental music made by bending a saw and scraping with a small object, most typically a screwdriver; it is used to accompany dances derived from European forms like polka and waltz. Rake-and-scrape's popularity has been declining in recent years, but performers like Lassie Do and the Boys continue to keep the tradition alive. Christian rhyming spirituals and the ant'ems of sponge fishermen are now mostly dead traditions, decimated by the arrival of pop music, a 1930s sponge blight and other causes. E. Clement Bethel's master's thesis on traditional Bahamian music was adapted for the stage by his daughter, Nicolette Bethel and Philip A. Burrows. Music of The Bahamas was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1991, and was revived in 2002 for fresh Bahamian audiences. A recording of that show is available for sale from Ringplay Productions. Rake and scrape Rake and scrape music is played traditionally with Concertinas, Goombay drums, and a Handsaw. Rake and scrape is believed to have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake and scrape became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.http://www.bahamasentertainers.com/Paper/rkeNscr.html Organology of instruments Membranophones: The Goombay drum is main rhythmic component in rake-n-scrape. It is also referred to a goatskin drum, as the skin of a goat was stretched over a wooden barrel. It is decorated by simple or complex geometric designs in bright colors. The drum is always heated over fire to retain its tone. In 1971, when manufacturers started shipping products in metal barrels, Bahamians switched the drum to metal, slightly changing the tone of the drum.Ingraham 368 Idiophones: The main component that makes Rake- N-Scrape unique is the use of the Carpenter's Saw. This instrument is scraped with a nail or butter knife.

their descendants. However, there are many styles of Slovenian folk music beyond polka and waltz. Kolo, lender, ≈°tajeri≈°, mafrine and ≈°altin are a few of the traditional music styles and dances. Prehistory The Divje Babe flute, an artifact found in a cave near Cerkno, Slovenia, is possibly the oldest known musical instrument ever. Its age is estimated at approximately 55,000 years. The history of modern Slovenian music can be traced back to the 5th century, when Christianity spread in Carantania. Liturgical hymns (kyrie Eleison) were introduced, and became the first plainchant to make a connection to the peoples' language.  Classical music  =Medieval= During the medieval era, secular music was as popular as church music, including wandering minnesingers. Jurij Slatkonja, a Carniolan conductor and composer from Novo Mesto, became the director of the Vienna Boys' Choir in 1498. By the time of Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize in Carniola. The first Slovenian hymnal, Eni Psalmi, was published in 1567. This period saw the rise of Renaissance musicians like Jacobus Gallus.Oto Luthar The land between a history of Slovenia Italy was an important musical influence of the period, especially in sacred music, such as that of Antonio Tarsia (composer) of Koper, in oratorio and opera. A Commedia was performed in Ljubljana in 1660, and an opera in 1700 in the family palace of the Auerspergs. =Enlightenment= In 1701, Johann Berthold von H√∂ffer (1667‚Äì1718), a nobleman and amateur composer from Ljubljana, founded the Academia Philharmonicorum Labacensis based on Italian models.George J. Buelow A history of baroque music 2004 p701 and the Ljubljana branch of the Roman Academy of Arcadia was founded a few years later in 1709. Apart from H√∂ffer, the Cathedral provost Michael Omerza was also noted for his oratorios. The first major Slovenian opera was performed in 1732, Il Tamerlano by abbate Giuseppe Clemente de Bonomi, maestro di Capella, in the palace of the Carniolan vice-regent, the duke Francesco Antonio Sigifrid Della Torre e Valassina.Vlado Kotnik Opera, power and ideology: anthropological study of a national art 2010 In 1732, a performance of the tragedia per musica 'II Tamerlano' written by Maestro di Capella Giuseppe Clemente Bonomi, a bandmaster of the Carniolan vice-regent, the duke Francesco Antonio Sigifrid Della Torre e Valassina,Essays presented to Egon Wellesz Jack Allan Westrup ‚Äì 1966 IL TAMERLANO DE GIUSEPPE CLEMENTE BONOMI Dragotin Cvetko (Ljubljana) Parmi les compositeurs du pass√© musical europ√©en don't les biographies n'ont pas encore √©t√© l'objet de Recherches approfondies ou qui m√™me n'ont pas encore √©t√© √©tudi√©s ...Italian Opera in Central Europe: Volume 1 ‚Äì Page 64 Melania Bucciarelli, Norbert Dubowy, Reinhard Strohm ‚Äì 2006 In the libretto for the Ljubljana performance this introduction is followed, on page six, by the remark: La Musica √® Virtuosa Fatica del sempre Celebre Signor Abbate D.

The 1794 formation of the Philharmonische Gesellschaft was important because it was one of the first such orchestras in Central Europe. =19th century= The 19th century saw the growth of a distinctively Slovenian classical music sound based on romanticism, while the German minority continued to push for a stronger Germanic identity. The Ljubljana opera house (1892) was shared by Slovene and German opera companies. Composers of Slovenian Lieder and art songs include Emil Adamiƒç (1877‚Äì1936), Fran Gerbiƒç (1840‚Äì1917), Alojz Ger≈æiniƒç (1915‚Äì2008), Benjamin Ipavec (1829‚Äì1908), Davorin Jenko (1835‚Äì1914), Anton Lajovic (1878‚Äì1960), Kamilo Ma≈°ek (1831‚Äì1859), Josip Pavƒçiƒç (1870‚Äì1949), Zorko Prelovec (1887‚Äì1939), and Lucijan Marija ≈†kerjanc (1900‚Äì1973). =20th century= In the early 20th century, impressionism was spreading across Slovenia, which soon produced composers Marij Kogoj and Slavko Osterc. Avant-garde classical music arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of Uro≈° Krek, Dane ≈†kerl, Primo≈æ Ramov≈° and Ivo Petriƒá, who also conducted the Slavko Osterc Ensemble. Jakob Je≈æ, Darijan Bo≈æiƒç, Lojze Lebiƒç and Vinko Globokar have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's L'Armonia, an opera. In the 1950s, Bo≈æidar Kantu≈°er was the most progressive of all, by dint of his atonality. =Contemporary= Contemporary classic music composers include Uro≈° Rojko, Toma≈æ Svete, Brina Je≈æ-Brezav≈°ƒçek and Aldo Kumar. Kumar's Sonata z igro 12 (A sonata with a play 12), a set of variations on a rising chromatic scale, is particularly notable. Opera The Ljubljana Opera House serves as the national opera and ballet house. Mezzo-soprano Marjana Lipov≈°ek was born in Ljubljana. Film music The composer of film scores for 170 films was Bojan Adamiƒç (1912‚Äì1995).  Folk music  =Vocal= Rural Harmony singing is a deep rooted tradition in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. =Instrumental= Typical Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, zithers, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In eastern Slovenia, fiddle and cimbalon bands are called velike goslarije. Traditional Slovenian music include various kinds of musical instruments such as: *Steirische Harmonika *Kontra *Hammered dulcimer *Cimbalon grande *Drone zither *Violin zither *Zither *Tamburica *Fiddle *Carnian fiddle *Cello *Brunkula cello *Gaida *Brass instruments, such as baritone horn *Clarinet *Jaw harp *Clay pot bass *Okarina *Klopotec *Panpipes *Wooden cross flutes of various sizes *Psaltery *Tambourine Folk music revivalists include Volk Volk, Kurja Ko≈æa, Marko Banda, Katice, Bogdana Herman, Ljoba Jenƒçe, Vruja, Trinajsto pra≈°e, ≈†avrinske pupe en ragacone, Musicante Istriani, and Tolovaj Mataj. One of the best Slovenian diatonic accordionists is Nejc Paƒçnik who won the accordion world-championship twice, in 2009 and 2015. =Slovenian pop-folk music= From 1952 on, the Slavko Avsenik's band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the West Germany, inventing the original \\"Oberkrainer\\" sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and in the Benelux, spawning hundreds of Alpine orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the Slovenian-style polka legacy. Avsenik's most popular instrumental composition is the polka that is titled \\"Na Golici\\" (in Slovene), or \\"Trompetenecho\\" (in German), and \\"Trumpet Echoes\\" (in English). Oberkrainer music, which the Avsenik Ensemble popularized, is always a strong candidate for pop-folk music awards in Slovenia and Austria. Slavko and his brother, Vilko, are usually credited as the pioneers of Slovenian folk music, having solidified its style in the 1950s. Many musicians followed Avsenik's steps, one of the most famous being Lojze Slak. Slovenian song festival A similarly high standing in Slovene culture, like the Sanremo Music Festival has had in Italian culture, was attributed to the coastal Melodies of Sea and Sun (In Slovene: Melodije morja in sonca) and Slovenian song festival (In Slovene: Slovenska popevka), dedicated to a specific genre of popular Slovene music.Slovenska popevka: velik poudarek na pevcih in skladateljih, pesniki bolj v oklepaju.

After 1990, Adi Smolar, Iztok Mlakar, Vita Mavriƒç, Vlado Kreslin, Zoran Predin, Peter Lov≈°in, and Magnifico have been popular in Slovenia, as well. World music The 1970s Bratko Bibiƒç's band Begnagrad is considered one of the direct influences on modern world music. Bibiƒç's unique accordion style, often solo, with no accompaniment, has also made him a solo star. Punk rock Slovenia was the center for punk rock in the Titoist Yugoslavia. The most famous representatives of this genre were Pankrti, Niet, Lublanski Psi, ƒåao Piƒçke, Via Ofenziva, To≈æibabe, and Otroci Socializma. Techno and tech-house Slovenia has also produced two renowned DJs: DJ Umek and Valentino Kanzyani. Specialising in a frantic brand of party techno and tech-house, the pair co-founded the label Recycled Loops as well as having many releases on labels such as Novamute, Primate, Intec and Bassethound Records. Neue Slowenische Kunst Neue Slowenische Kunst (a German phrase meaning \\"New Slovenian Art\\"), aka NSK, is a controversial political art collective that announced itself in Slovenia in 1984, when Slovenia was part of Yugoslavia. NSK's name, being German, is compatible with a theme in NSK works: the complicated relationship Slovenes have had with Germans. The name of NSK's music wing, Laibach, is also the German name of the Slovene capital Ljubljana, creating controversy through evoking memories of the Nazi occupation of Slovenia during the Second World War.Monroe, Alexei. Interrogation Machine. MIT Press, 2005. p 3. =Composition= Laibach performing at wRacku Festiwal 2010 NSK's best-known member is the musical group Laibach. Other NSK member groups include IRWIN (visual art), Noordung (theater; originally named Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre, also known as Red Pilot), New Collective Studio (graphics; also known as New Collectivism), Retrovision (film and video), and the Department of Pure and Applied Philosophy (theory).Anonymous. \\"State of Art: the new Slovene Avant Garde\\" (2004). Northwest Film Forum and Scala House, program for exhibit 18 ‚Äì 24 November 2004 at Northwest Film Forum, Seattle.Regina Hackett. \\"Slovenian art collective is adept at working politics and art\\". Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 19 November 2004. The founding groups of the NSK were Laibach, IRWIN, and Scipion Na≈°ice Sisters Theater. =Characteristics= NSK art often draws on symbols drawn from totalitarian or extreme nationalist movements, often reappropriating totalitarian kitsch in a visual style reminiscent of Dada. NSK artists often juxtapose symbols from different (and often incompatible) political ideologies. For example, a 1987 NSK-designed poster caused a scandal by winning a competition for the Yugoslavian Youth Day Celebration. The poster appropriated a painting by Nazi artist Richard Klein, replacing the flag of Nazi Germany with the Yugoslav flag and the German eagle with a dove. Both IRWIN and Laibach are emphatic about their work being collective rather than individual. Laibach's original songs and arrangements are always credited to the group collectively; the individual artists are not named on their album covers; at one point, there were even two separate Laibach groups touring at the same time, both with members of the original group. Similarly, the IRWIN artists never sign their work individually; instead, they are \\"signed\\" with a stamp or certificate indicating approval as a work from the IRWIN collective. The NSK were the subject of a 1996 documentary film written and directed by Michael Benson, entitled Prerokbe Ognja in Slovenian, or Predictions of Fire in English. Among those interviewed in the film is Slovenian intellectual Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. =NSK State= Since 1991, NSK has claimed to constitute a state, a claim similar to that of micronations. They issue passports, have presented shows of their work in the guise of an embassy or even as a territory of their supposed state, and maintain consulates in several cities including Umag, Croatia. NSK have also issued postage stamps. Laibach, in 2006, recorded (some may say 'remixed') the NSK State National Anthem on the LP \\"Volk.\\" The \\"anthem\\" adopts its melody from another Laibach song, \\"The Great Seal.\\" Laibach's version of the NSK anthem includes a computer voice reciting an excerpt from Winston Churchill's famous \\"We shall fight them on the beaches/We shall never surrender\\" speech. The computer voice is clearly recognisable as the voice synthesiser Macintalk, built into classic Mac OS, and uses the preset voice Ralph. The NSK passports are an art project and as such are not valid for travel. However, many desperate people have fallen for a scam in which they are issued a NSK passport. Most of these scams originate in Nigeria and Egypt. =Laibach= Laibach is a Slovenian avant-garde music group strongly associated with Nazism, martial, and neo-classical musical styles. Laibach formed 1 June 1980 in Trbovlje, Slovenia (then Yugoslavia). Laibach represents the music wing of the Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK) art collective, of which it was a founding member in 1984. The name \\"Laibach\\" is the German name for Slovenia's capital city, Ljubljana.

They reveal a wealth of various influences and liturgical traditions that converged in this region (Dalmatian liturgy in Benevento script, Northern Gregorian chant, and original Glagolitic chant). =Renaissance and baroque= Petar Hektoroviƒá (1487‚Äì1572) Early in the 15th century, the ideas of Humanism in Croatia brought about changes to the world of music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing influence of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities. Humanists and philosophers promulgated new musical theories and aesthetic ideas: Federik Grisogono, Pavao Skaliƒá, Frane Petriƒá. The writing down of folk and popular music began in mid- sixteenth century: in the poem Fishing and Fishermen's Talk from 1558, Petar Hektoroviƒá ingrained Neoplatonic ideals in popular music; and transcripts of Croatian musical folklore were printed in Venetian anthologies (Giulio Cesare Barbetta 1569, Marco Facoli 1588). Julije Skjavetiƒá from ≈†ibenik published his madrigals (Li madrigali a quattro, et a cinque voci 1562), while his Motetti a cinque et a sei voci, (1564) are characterised by a lavish polyphonic structure under the influence of the Dutch school. Music and dance were a component part of theatrical expression (Mavro Vetranoviƒá, Nikola Nalje≈°koviƒá, Marin Dr≈æiƒá, Marin Benetoviƒá), while the function of music and sound effects was under the influence of Italian pastorals. The most prominent Croatian composers of this period include Ivan Lukaƒçiƒá, Vinko Jeliƒá and Atanazije Jurjeviƒá. New tendencies of early Baroque monody soon found their way into the domestic musical tradition, both sacral and secular. Tomaso Cecchini, from Verona, who spent his entire working life (1603‚Äì44) as a choirmaster, organist and composer in Split and Hvar, published his madrigals Armonici concetti, libro primo (1612) as the oldest Baroque collection written for the Croatian milieu. The collection Sacrae cantiones (Venice 1620) by Ivan Lukaƒçiƒá from ≈†ibenik is valuable testimony of sacral music that was performed in Split, and is generally speaking, one of the most significant monuments of old Croatian music altogether. The Franciscans and Paulists cultivated sacral chants, mostly monophonic and without organ accompaniment (the manuscript cantos of Frane Divniƒá, Bone Razmiloviƒá, Filip Vlahoviƒá-Kapu≈°varac, Franjo Vukovarac and Petar Kne≈æeviƒá). Also, worth mentioning is Ragusino Vincenzo Comnen, the only representative of the music of the Dubrovnik nobility. The tradition of the Baroque was more lasting in church/sacral music, which was the musical form that was systematically nurtured in numerous monasteries (especially Franciscan ones) as well as in parish and cathedral churches. The preservation of music manuscripts and prints became a widespread practice in the mid-18th century. Simple vocal-instrumental music for two voices with organ continuo was the form most frequently performed in churches; more prominent individuals active in the sphere of music could be found only in larger urban centres. They were mostly organists and maestri di cappella, skilful composers who had small vocal and/or instrumental ensembles and who frequently acted as music teachers (private or in church schools). The gradual development of the middle class had as one of its consequences the corresponding secular organisation of musical life, particularly in the first decades of the 19th century, a period that saw the establishment of music ensembles, music societies (1827 in Zagreb, then in Vara≈ædin, Rijeka, Osijek etc.) and music schools. In addition, public balls and other events were organised (music academies, theatre performances) with the participation of local and foreign musicians (from Italy, Austria, Bohemia etc.) including the private collection of music materials for playing music at home. Music became a component part of various festivities, such as the arrival of important political personalities (the new governor or the Habsburg king Frances I, etc.), the feasts of patron saints (St. Blaise in Dubrovnik, St. Domnius in Split, St. Stephen in Hvar and Zagreb etc.), for which so called art music was specifically composed, with the inclusion of popular elements (bourgeois dances, folk music of the peasantry). =Romanticism= Many Italian and domestic musicians worked in Dubrovnik: in the cathedral choir and orchestra, in the Duke's orchestra, at private and public festivities. An excellent early example of pre-classical symphony and chamber music was given by Luka Sorkoƒçeviƒá, a nobleman educated in Rome, as well as his son Antun, a historian and diplomat. Ferdo Livadiƒá (1799‚Äì1879) wrote Notturno in F-sharp minor for piano as early as 1822, which is, along with John Field's compositions under the same name, one of the earliest examples of that type of piano miniatures in general. In the course of the 1830s, as a reflection of such tendencies in Europe, the Illyrian Movement emerged in Croatia which assigned not only to literature but to music as well a particular socio-political role: the forming and guarding of national awareness including the struggle against Hungarization and Germanization. Accordingly, in 1846 Josip Runjanin (1821‚Äì1878) put to music Antun Mihanoviƒá's 1835 poem \\"Horvatska domovina\\" (Croatian Homeland), which later became the Croatian national anthem. In such a setting Vatroslav Lisinski (1819‚Äì1954) composed the first Croatian national opera Ljubav i zloba (Love and Malice), which premi√®red in Zagreb in 1846. Taking into consideration the presence of folk music, the aspirations of the Illyrians went far beyond the results achieved, something that is also continued in the work of Ivan Zajc (1832‚Äì1914) in the second half of the century. His masterpiece, the opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinjski, ever since its opening night in Zagreb in 1876, had not lost in popularity, partly because its heroic patriotism functions as a symbol of Croatia's victory. Finally, owing to the founder of Croatian ethno- musicology and musical historiography, Franjo Kuhaƒç (1834‚Äì1911), the systematic research of folklore evolved simultaneously with Zajc's endeavours. Finally it should be added that in Zajc's and Kuhaƒç's era, major halls for musical performances and concerts were built: in Zagreb the building of the Croatian Music Institute (1876, 1895) with a concert hall, and the building of the Croatian National Theatre (1895), including the theatre buildings in Rijeka (1885), Split (1893) and Osijek (1907) where, along with the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, drama, opera and ballet performances are still played today. During the 19th century, other instrumentalists and singers won international recognition, for example, the violinist Franjo Kre≈æma (1862‚Äì1881), singers, among which Ilma Murska (1834‚Äì1889), Matilda Mallinger (1847‚Äì1920) who sang at the opening night of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg in 1868, Milka Trnina (1863‚Äì1941) and Josip Ka≈°man (1850‚Äì1925), the first Croatian singer to appear at the New York Metropolitan Opera. Folk music Traditional Croatian musicians play for Mrs. Laura Bush on April 7, 2008 in Zagreb. The traditional folk music of Croatia is mostly associated with the following: =Ganga= Ganga is a type of singing which is characterized by a lone singer singing one line of lyrics and then others joining in for what can be best described as a wail. It is a very passionate form of singing, which is one of the reasons it has been limited in popularity to small towns. Even though it is a unique and autochthonous form of singing by Croats, it is very rare to hear this music on Croatian airwaves. However, several popular Croatian musicians have incorporated some ganga into their work. It can also be heard in concert music: the American composer Craig Walsh incorporates a ganga-inspired wailing, sighing, pitch-bending, micro-tonal vocal style in his 'String Quartet No. 1' (2010), a work commissioned for the Sarajevo Chamber Music Festival and the Manhattan String Quartet, the second movement of which is clearly paying homage to ganga style. Only recently has ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly nationalistic overtones and incorporating themes from the Croatian Homeland War. Although both men and women regularly perform ganga, it is extremely unusual for them to perform songs together. It is not unusual at all for both Catholic and Muslim men to perform ganga together. =Klapa= A Klapa group at a concert in Zagreb The klapa music is a form of a cappella singing that first appeared in littoral Croatia during the middle of the 19th century. The word klapa is derived from a word in slang Italian spoken in Trieste at the time. It refers to \\"a group of people\\" and the singing style traces its roots to liturgical church singing. The motifs, in general, celebrate love, wine (grapes), country (homeland) and sea. The main elements of the music are harmony and melody, with rhythm very rarely being very important. A klapa group consists of a first tenor, a second tenor, a baritone, and a bass. It is possible to double all the voices apart from the first tenor. Although klapa is a cappella music, on occasion, it is possible to add a gentle guitar and a mandolin. Klapa singing has become increasingly popular in littoral Croatia. Many young people from Dalmatia treasure klapa and sing it regularly when going out eating/drinking. This music has gained popularity among mainstream audiences in coastal regions of Croatia, with newer klapas formed by younger generations fusing klapa vocals with other music styles, such as klapa Libar's metal cover of \\"Pusti da ti leut svira\\" and the pop/klapa song \\"Kako ƒáu joj reƒá' da varin\\" by klapa DVD-a ≈Ωrnovnica Sv. Florijan, which won the Split Song Festival in 2010. =Tamburica= Bisernica, a traditional taburitza instrument Tamburica (diminutive of tambura) music is a form of folk music that involves these and related string instruments. It became increasingly popular in the 1800s, and small bands began to form, paralleling similar developments in Russia, Italy and the Ukraine. The main themes of tamburitza songs are the common themes of love and happy village life. Tamburitza music is primarily associated with the northern, Pannonian part of the country. It is sometimes said that the first sextet of tambura players was formed by Pajo Kolariƒá of Osijek in 1847. In 1971 one of the most famous and long lasting tamburitza ensembles Slavonski Beƒáari was formed led by the legend of tamburitza music Antun Nikoliƒá Tuca. Traditional tamburitza ensembles are still commonplace, but more professional groups have formed in the last few decades. These include Zlatni dukati and Ex Panonia, the first such groups, Zdenac, Slavonske Lole, Berde Band and the modernized rock and roll-influenced Gazde. The style of Tambura music played most often in the United States during the latter half of the 20th Century was not significantly different from the style played at the turn of the 19th Century. Free of the influences of pop music in Jugoslavia and the nascent, independent republics, and without large quantities of immigrants bringing new methods and styles, American-style Tambura music, and to a lesser extent, Canadian-style Tambura music stayed true to its roots. Today, the most prevalent forms of Tambura music are folk- pop combinations. =Gusle= A traditional gusle instrument from Dalmatia The gusle music is played on this traditional string instrument. It is primarily rooted in epic poetry with emphasis on important historical or patriotic events. It is the traditional instrument of inland Dalmatia and of Herzegovina, the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina with predominant Croatian population. Gusle players are known for glorifying outlaws such as hajduks or uskoks of the long gone Turkish reign or exalting the recent heroes of the Croatian War of Independence. Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá, a famous 18th-century author, had also composed verses in form of the traditional folk poetry (deseterac, ten verses). His book Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog became Croatian folk Bible which inspired numerous gusle players ever since. As for contemporary gusle players in Croatia, one person that particularly stands out is Mile Krajina. Krajina is a prolific folk poet and gusle player who gained cult status among some conservative groups. There are also several other prominent Croatian gusle players who often perform at various folk-festivals throughout Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. =Diple= Diple is a traditional woodwind musical instrument in Croatian music. Sometimes called \\"Mih\\", \\"mjeh\\", \\"mjesina\\" or only \\"diple\\", it is played from Istria, Lika, over Dalmatia Islands and Coast to Herzegovina. \\"Mih\\" is made of tanned goat or sheep skin and consists of a \\"dulac\\" or \\"kanela\\" through which the air is blown and \\"diple\\" (chanter) on which it is played. Inside the \\"mih\\" on the chanter, two single-blade reeds are situated. Unlike bagpipes, \\"Mih\\" doesn't have a \\"trubanj\\" or \\"bordun\\" (drone). Although they are very similar, the \\"mih\\" from different parts of Croatia still differ in type of chanter, in the position of holes or in some tiny details (for example ornaments). =Other folk traditions= An accordion on display in Zagreb. The folk music of Zagorje, an area north of Zagreb, is known for small orchestras consisting of Violins, Cimbule, Tamburice and Harmonike. The Tamburica (also known as tambura) is the Croatian national string instrument. Although there is a rich pool of folk songs in this region, traditions are not being cherished and most Zagorian folk music available is performed by amateur groups. This is also reflected in the quality of the music, which is mostly reduced to happy upbeat songs. Several sopila instruments. The folk music of Meƒëimurje, a small but distinct region in northernmost Croatia, with its melancholic and soothing tunes became the most popular form of folk to be used in the modern ethno pop-rock songs. Beside Cimbule and Violins, there is also a tradition of Brass orchestras which used to play an important role in cultural everyday life. On one hand, they were the foundation of every regional celebration or wedding but on the other hand they were also known for playing at funerals or funeral feasts. In Istria and Kvarner, native instruments like sopila, curla and diple make a distinctive regional sound. It is partially diatonic in nature following the unique Istrian scale. =Events= The Slavonian town Po≈æega hosts a known folk music festival, Zlatne ≈æice Slavonije (Golden strings of Slavonia), which has prompted musicians to compose new songs with far-reaching influences, recently including American bluegrass. The towns of Vinkovci and ƒêakovo, also in Slavonia, host yearly folklore festivals (Vinkovaƒçke jeseni and ƒêakovaƒçki vezovi) where folk music is also listened to as part of the tradition. The town of Slavonski Brod holds an annual festival called Brodfest, where many of the great tamburica bands come together to play. The Dubrovnik Summer Festival puts on dramatic music and ballet. It was founded in 1950. The Osor Musical Evenings was founded in 1976 and takes place in July and August. It plays classical Croatian masters. The Musical Evenings in Donat takes place during the summer in Zadar. It was founded in 1961, and plays old music. Popular music =Pop= The pop music of Croatia generally resembles the canzone music of Italy, while including elements of the native traditional music. Croatian record companies produce a lot of material each year, if only to populate the numerous music festivals. Of special note is the Split Festival which usually produces the most popular summer hits. Seasoned pop singers in Croatia include: Meri Cetiniƒá, Mi≈°o Kovaƒç, Ivo Robiƒá, Vice Vukov, Milan Baƒçiƒá, Arsen Dediƒá, Vinko Coce, Zdenka Vuƒçkoviƒá, Darko Domjan, Tereza Kesovija, Gabi Novak, Ivica ≈†erfezi, Oliver Dragojeviƒá, Tomislav Ivƒçiƒá, Doris Dragoviƒá, Radojka ≈†verko, Maja Blagdan, and many others. Also, the groups Magazin and Grupa 777 have had sustained careers. In more recent times, younger performers such as Nina Badriƒá, Severina, Gibonni, Toni Cetinski, Jelena Rozga, Danijela, Lidija Baƒçiƒá, Antonija ≈†ola, Lana Jurƒçeviƒá and many others have captured the attention of the pop audience. Each of them have successfully blended various influences into their distinct music style. For example, Thompson's songs include traditional epic themes from the Dinaric regions; Severina threads between Croatian pop and a folk sound. Croatian pop music is fairly often listened to in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia due to the union of Yugoslavia that existed until the 1990s. Conversely, Bosnian singers like Dino Merlin and Serbian ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá have an audience in Croatia, as well as some others. More recently the Turbo folk ‚Äì frowned upon by the establishment some music critics and social commentators ‚Äì has been popular amongst some sections of Croatian youth. A general resentment to Turbo folk remains as it is not broadcast on state radio and TV. Where on private outlets it may be transmitted, it normally triggers a strong negative reaction from those not liking it. Croatian singers that are using elements of Turbo folk are Severina and Jelena Rozga. Croatia is a regular contestant on the Eurovision Song Contest. Back in Yugoslavia, Croatian pop group Riva won the contest in 1989. Some of the other Croatians who performed on the ESC include Danijel Popoviƒá, Put, Boris Novkoviƒá and Claudia Beni. =Rock= The most popular rock bands active during the former Yugoslavia included Haustor, Psihomodo Pop, Azra, Prljavo Kazali≈°te and Parni Valjak. There are several rather popular and long-lasting mainstream rock acts like Parni Valjak, Prljavo Kazali≈°te, Crvena Jabuka, Atomsko Skloni≈°te, Aerodrom, Tutti Frutti Band, Daleka Obala, ƒêavoli, Stijene, More, Osmi putnik, Metak, etc. They originated in the 1970s and 1980s, and for the better part of their career resorted to a more mellow, mainstream pop-rock sound. Of some note is also the Sarajevo school of pop rock which influenced many of these bands, and which also included singers like ≈Ωeljko Bebek who later worked in Croatia. However, Croatian new wave (Novi val) movement, which exploded in 1979/80 and lasted throughout the 1980s, is considered by many to be the high-water mark of Croatian rock music, both in terms of quality and commercial success. The most influential and popular bands of Novi val were Azra, Haustor, Film, even early Prljavo Kazali≈°te. Other notable acts were Animatori, Buldo≈æer, Paraf, Patrola etc. In the late 1980s, the region of Istria became home to a kind of called ƒåa-val, which often used the ƒåakavian dialect and elements of traditional music from the regions of Istria and Kvarner. The new wave scene has collapsed by the end of the eighties, to be replaced by the newcomers like; Tutti Frutti band, Daleka Obala, Majke and Laufer. While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the Black Crowes, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, as well as their Serbian counterparts Partibrejkers. Laufer, led by Damir Urban (who later went on to form Urban & 4), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their cue from the grunge movement. Let 3 and KUD Idijoti are also prominent rock acts, popular both for their music and their interesting, often controversial, performances and stunts. Beginning in the late 1980s, folk-rock groups also sprouted across Croatia. The first is said to be Vje≈°tice, who combined Meƒëimurje folk music with rock and set the stage for artists like Legen, Lidija Bajuk and Dunja Knebl. At the same time on the other side of Croatia, in Istria, a band called Gustafi started playing their own strange amalgamate of rock and Istrian folk, but it took them more than a decade to reach the nationwide audience. The Split metal band Osmi Putnik has also been a success in Croatia and still are today and are also popular in other ex-Yugoslav republics The Sisak surf rock band The Bambi Molesters has in the past years gained sizeable international fame and are often touted as one of the best surf-rock acts in the world today. Alternative rock/metal band Father have had success with their first album inspirita in countries like the UK, and have toured with bands like Korn, Anthrax and Apocalyptica. There is also a number of Croatian bands who play modern music in English, most prominent being My Buddy Moose, The orange strips, In-the-go, Kimiko, Cold Snap and Snovi =Dance= Dance music in Croatia was an offspring of the local pop music and more Western influences. It developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s, picking up on the trends such as euro disco and eurodance. It also spawned a wave of electronic music artists, mostly house, techno and trance. Dino Dvornik is one of the pioneers of electronic music in Croatian. The singer Vanna rose to prominence through the dance trio E.T., and the music of Vesna Pisaroviƒá has a fair bit of dance beat. Although E.T. still operates, they've changed singers several times and lost in popularity. The band Colonia is perhaps the only one that rode the dance wave of the '90s and today is one of the most popular performers in Croatia. =Rap= The 1990s were marked by the emergence of Croatian rap music. The Ugly Leaders released the first ever Croatian Hip-Hop album, and gained a strong following in and around Rijeka. In 1991, the Croatian Liberation Front released two widely popular protest singles. The first rap band to gain widespread and lasting acclaim was The Beat Fleet (TBF) from Split, whose members took inspiration from harsh economic and social conditions of war-torn Dalmatia, not that different from American inner cities. Their act was followed by a multitude of artists and groups in Zagreb, taking inspiration from American gangsta rap. The Zagreb rappers Bolesna Braƒáa (also called Sick Rhyme Sayazz) and Tram 11 became particularly popular, and to an extent also the duo Nered & Stoka. The Croatian rap gained much from the fact Edo Maajka, a Bosnian rapper, signed on to a label in Zagreb. Recently a rapper known as Shorty gained a lot of popularity by having songs with strong regional flavour of his native Vinkovci. The Zagreb band Elemental also burst into the scene featuring one of the few Croatian female rappers. =Other= The tendency to combine different elements also has a long presence in more classical music: the opera Ero s onoga svijeta, written by Jakov Gotovac in the 1930s, blended the traditional music of the Dinaric peoples into a scholarly form and achieved great success. Classical Classical musicians and compositions by Croatian composers are generally not well known worldwide despite having produced a huge and interesting contribution over many centuries. Influences of style were often taken from neighbouring influences (Italy, Austria) or settlers (in the Mediterranean Croatia from Italy, and in Panonia (north Croatia) from Germany and Bohemia). Croatian composers by current relevance in a global framework: (Maybe the order will change in the future, given that 95% of the composition exists as a single copy ‚Äì the original manuscript, and yet need to be saved from oblivion, and then be performed and recorded on CD, and then presented to the international public) * Vatroslav Lisinski (born as Ignaz Fuchs) considered as the founder of the Croatian nationalist music composed the first Croatian national opera Ljubav i Zloba (Love and Malice) and national opera Porin.

Jazz Jazz appeared in Croatia in the 1920s, and flourished in Zagreb by the late 2000s, making it a regional center for jazz. In 1947, the jazz orchestra of Radio Zagreb was founded, which lives on today as the \\"HRT Big Band.\\" In 1959, vibraphone player Bo≈°ko Petroviƒá, who was likely the most famous Croatian jazz musician, founded the Zagreb Jazz Quartet. Today, there is a fair number of active jazz groups in Croatia, and various cities host jazz festivals. Jazz has left its mark on the Croatian pop scene throughout the years, most notably in the works of Drago Dikliƒá and occasionally Josipa Lisac.  Christian music  Croatian Catholic priests of Dalmatia, Istria and Kotor sang in Church Slavonic language during the 9th and 10th centuries, from which formed different forms of individual or choral spiritual music. The first inscription about that kind of singing dates from 1177, when it was sung laudibus and canticis \\"in eorum sclavica lingua\\" to Pope Alexander II during his visit in Zadar.\\"Glagolja≈°ko pjevanje\\" culturenet.hr, accessed 2 February 2018 (in Croatian) Very famous is repertory of church verses Cithara octochorda, which was published three times (Vienna: 1701, 1723 and Zagreb: 1757).Kovaƒçeviƒá, Kre≈°imir (ed.), Leksikon jugoslavenske muzike, vol. 1, Zagreb: JLZ, 1984, p 132‚Äì133. It contains Christian music inheritance of Croats, both Kajkavian and Latin verses. Those verses set to music and adapted to organs famous Croatian church music composers Albe Vidakoviƒá, Anƒëelko Klobuƒçar and others. That arrangement is part of Catholic liturgy in Croatia today.

He was the Assistant Secretary of War from 1937 to 1940 and the 15th national commander of The American Legion, from 1932 to 1933.  Early life  Johnson was born on January 10, 1891, in Roanoke, Virginia, to Marcellus and Catherine (n√©e Arthur) Johnson. He earned a law degree from the University of Virginia. After graduation he practiced law in Clarksburg, West Virginia; his firm, Steptoe & Johnson eventually opened offices in Charleston, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1916, he served as majority floor leader and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. During World War I, Johnson saw action as an Army captain in France, where he compiled a long report to the War Department on Army management and materiel requisition practices.

Roosevelt bypassed Johnson for the position of Secretary of War, instead choosing Henry Stimson.McFarland, Keith D. and Roll, David L., Louis Johnson and the Arming of America: The Roosevelt and Truman Years, Indiana University Press (2005) , Master of the Pentagon, Time Magazine, 6 June 1949 Article Having aspired to the position of Secretary, which he felt he had earned, Johnson felt betrayed by Roosevelt.Master of the Pentagon, Time Magazine, 6 June 1949 During the war, Johnson had no major responsibilities within the government involving military matters, though he did agree to participate in the Roosevelt administration's war mobilization of U.S. industry. Later, he served as Alien Property custodian for the American operations of the German chemical giant I. G. Farben. In 1942, Johnson briefly served as the president's personal representative in India, until an intestinal illnessMaster of the Pentagon, Time Magazine, 6 June 1949: Reportedly, this was a case of 'Delhi Belly', a common gastrointestinal illness suffered by newcomers to India. caused him to resign his post and return to the United States.  Secretary of Defense  In the 1948 U.S. presidential campaign, Johnson was chief fundraiser for President Truman's election campaign; the money raised by Johnson proved crucial to Truman's come-from-behind victory in the November elections. As a regular visitor to the White House, Johnson not only continued to express an interest in defense matters, but actively campaigned for the post of Secretary of Defense. He was also a staunch supporter of Truman's desire to 'hold the line' on defense spending. After a series of conflicts with Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal over defense budget cutbacks, President Truman asked for Forrestal's resignation, replacing him with Johnson early in 1949. = Defense budget reductions = Secretary Johnson entered office sharing the president's commitment to achieve further military unification and to drastically reduce budget expenditures on defense in favor of other government programs.LaFeber 1993. As one of Truman's staunchest political supporters, Johnson was viewed by Truman as the ideal candidate to push Truman's defense budget economization policy in the face of continued resistance by the Department of Defense and the armed forces. According to historian Walter LaFeber, Truman was known to approach defense budgetary requests in the abstract, without regard to defense response requirements in the event of conflicts with potential enemies. Truman would begin by subtracting from total receipts the amount needed for domestic needs and recurrent operating costs, with any surplus going to the defense budget for that year. From the beginning, Johnson and Truman assumed that the United States' monopoly on the atomic bomb was adequate protection against any and all external threats. Johnson's unwillingness to budget conventional readiness needs for the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps soon caused fierce controversies within the upper ranks of the armed forces.Blair 2003. From fiscal year 1948 onwards, the defense department budget was capped at the amount set in FY 1947 ($14.4 billion), and was progressively reduced in succeeding fiscal years until January 1950, when it was reduced yet again to US $13.5 billion.Hofmann, George F., Tanks and the Korean War: A case study of unpreparedness, Armor, Vol. 109 Issue 5 (Sep/Oct 2000), pp. 7-12 Johnson was also an advocate of defense unification, which he saw as a means to further reduce defense spending requirements. At a press conference the day after he took office, Johnson promised a drastic cut in the number of National Military Establishment boards, committees, and commissions, and added, \\"To the limit the present law allows, I promise you there will be unification as rapidly as the efficiency of the service permits it.\\" Later, in one of his frequent speeches on unification, Johnson stated that \\"this nation can no longer tolerate the autonomous conduct of any single service ... a waste of the resources of America in spendthrift defense is an invitation to disaster for America.\\" To ensure congressional approval of proposed DOD budget requests, both President Truman and Secretary Johnson demanded public acquiescence, if not outright support, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and other military department commanders when making public statements or testifying before Congress.Davis, Vincent, The Post-imperial Presidency, New Brunswick: Transaction Press (1980), p. 102 In 1948, JCS Chief of Staff General Omar Bradley stated that \\"the Army of 1948 could not fight its way out of a paper bag.\\"Dunford, J.F. (Lt. Col.) The Strategic Implications of Defensive Operations at the Pusan Perimeter July‚ÄìSeptember 1950, Carlisle, PA: U.S. Army War College (7 April 1999) p. 6Bradley, Omar, and Blair, Clay, A General's Life: An AutoBiography by General of the Army Omar N. Bradley, p. 474Blair, Clay, The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950-1953, Naval Institute Press (2003), p. 290Hofmann, George F., pp. 7-12 Yet the following year, after becoming Chairman of the JCS under Johnson, Bradley reversed course and publicly supported Johnson's decisions, telling Congress that he would be doing a \\"disservice to the nation\\" if he asked for a larger military force.Bradley, Omar, and Blair, Clay, A General's Life: An AutoBiography by General of the Army Omar N. Bradley, pp. 486-487Davis, Vincent, p. 102 General J. Lawton Collins went even further when testifying before a House Appropriations committee, stating that Truman administration reductions in Army force levels made it more effective.Davis, Vincent, The Post-imperial Presidency, New Brunswick: Transaction Press (1980), p. 102: In reality, reductions in Army budget requests from 1948 onwards caused not only reductions in troop levels, but also forced an 80 percent reduction in equipment requirements, thus deferring Army equipment modernization plans for the next three years. Johnson promptly began proposing mothballing or scrapping much of the Navy's conventional surface fleet and amphibious forces. Shortly after his appointment, Johnson had a conversation with Admiral Richard L. Conolly, revealing his attitudes towards the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps and any need for non-nuclear forces: > Admiral, the Navy is on its way out. There's no reason for having a Navy and > a Marine Corps. General Bradley tells me amphibious operations are a thing > of the past. We'll never have any more amphibious operations. That does away > with the Marine Corps. And the Air Force can do anything the Navy can do, so > that does away with the Navy.Krulak 1999. Both Truman and Johnson extended their opposition to the Navy in their treatment of the U.S. Marine Corps. Truman had a well-known dislike of the Marines dating back to his Army service in World War I, and would say in August 1950, \\"The Marine Corps is the Navy's police force and as long as I am President that is what it will remain. They have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin's.\\" Johnson exploited this ill feeling of Truman's to reduce or eliminate many Marine Corps' budget requests. Johnson attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation by transferring its air assets to other services, and proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces. Johnson ordered that the highest-ranking Marine officer, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, be deleted from the official roll of chiefs of service branches authorized a driver and limousine, and for whom a special gun salute was prescribed on ceremonial occasions. He further specified that there would be no future official recognition or celebration of the Marine Corps birthday. More ominously, Johnson barred the Commandant of the Marine Corps from attending Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) meetings in his role of chief of service (including meetings involving Marine readiness or deployments). Johnson welcomed the passage of the 1949 amendments to the National Security Act of 1947, telling an American Legion convention that he was \\"happy to report ... that 80 percent of the problems that beset unification immediately disappeared when the President signed the bill increasing the authority and the responsibility of the Secretary of Defense.\\" Believing that the amendments would help him achieve additional budget cuts, Johnson estimated that one year after their passage the Defense Department would be achieving savings at the rate of $1 billion per year (he later claimed that he had attained this goal). One of his slogans was that the taxpayer was going to get \\"a dollar's worth of defense for every dollar spent\\" by the Pentagon, an approach that Truman approved. Johnson did not limit his budget-cutting campaign to the Navy or Marine Corps. Johnson ordered nearly all of the Army inventories of surplus World War II tanks, communications equipment, personnel carriers, and small arms be scrapped or sold off to other countries instead of being shipped to ordnance and storage depots for reconditioning and storage. Johnson even resisted budget requests for reserve stockpiles of small arms and anti-tank ammunition, anti-tank weapons, or amphibious infantry training for the Army's newly acquired ex-Navy landing craft, which promptly began to deteriorate from lack of proper maintenance. Though the Air Force faced fewer program cancellations and cuts, Johnson refused Air Force requests for a doubling of active air groups until the invasion of Korea, and favored reduction of tactical air force readiness in favor of the strategic nuclear bomber forces.Lane 2003.McFarland, p. 203Summers 1996.Wolk 2000. = Revolt of the Admirals = Johnson's defense cuts, which began on April 23, 1949, were accelerated after he announced the cancellation of the 65,000-ton flushdeck aircraft carrier . The United States Navy had been planning this ship for several years and construction had already begun. Johnson, supported by a slim majority of the JCS and by President Truman, stressed the need to cut costs. At least by implication, Johnson had scuttled the Navy's hope to participate in strategic nuclear air operations through use of the carrier. Neither the Department of the Navy nor Congress had been consulted in the termination of United States. Abruptly resigning, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan expressed concern about the future of the United States Marine Corps and both Marine and Naval Aviation, and Johnson's determination to eliminate those services through progressive program cuts. Faced with such large-scale budgetary reductions, competition between the service branches for remaining defense funds grew increasingly acrimonious. The cancellation of the supercarrier precipitated a bitter controversy between the Navy and the United States Air Force (USAF), the so-called \\"Revolt of the Admirals\\". In congressional hearings and other public arenas, the Navy reacted angrily to Johnson's action by openly questioning the ability of the Air Force's latest strategic bomber, the Convair B-36, to penetrate Soviet airspace. The Air Force countered with data supporting the B-36, and minimized the importance of a naval role for surface ships in future major conflicts. Subsequently, declassified material proved the USAF to be technically correct in its immediate assessment of the capabilities of the B-36 at the time of the Revolt of the Admirals. At the time, it was indeed virtually invulnerable to interception due to the great height at which it flew. However, the B-36 was a pre-World War II design and by the time it was actually operational and fully deployed to Air Force active duty bombardment wings and bombardment squadrons, the B-36 was hopelessly vulnerable to modern Soviet MiG-15 jet interceptors, aircraft that would greatly surprise U.S. officials when they later appeared over North Korea. Once engaged in the conflict in Korea that would evolve into the Korean War, the role of U.S. Air Force heavy bombers evolved into an extension of their role during World War II, support of in-theater tactical ground forces. In this instance, the USAF heavy bomber aircraft employed was the B-29 Superfortress of the second World War, while the B-36 would see no combat in Korea. In the long run, Navy arguments for the supercarrier prevailed, though not for the reasons originally cited. A relative failure as a strategic nuclear deterrent, the large aircraft carrier would prove invaluable as an element of conventional rapid deployment tactical air forces, requiring neither overflight permissions or overseas basing rights with host nations. Ironically, a successor to the canceled supercarrier, the radical new USS Forrestal, and later designs, continue in service with the U.S. Navy into the 21st century, forming the core of its offensive striking power. However, a more ominous (if less publicized) development than the supercarrier debate was Johnson's steady reduction of force in Navy ships, landing craft, and equipment needed for conventional force readiness. Ship after ship was mothballed from the fleet for lack of operating funds. The United States Navy and Marine Corps, once the world's preeminent amphibious force, lost most of its amphibious capabilities and landing craft which were scrapped or sold as surplus (the remaining craft were reserved solely for Army use in amphibious operations exercises, which did not utilize them in that role). = House investigation = In June 1949, the House Committee on Armed Services launched an investigation into charges, emanating unofficially from Navy sources, of malfeasance in office against Secretary Johnson and Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington. The hearings also looked into the capability of the B-36, the cancellation of the supercarrier United States and JCS procedures on weapons development, and ultimately examined the whole course of unification. In addition to disparaging the B-36, Navy representatives questioned the current U.S. military plan for immediate use of atomic weapons against large urban areas when a war started. The Navy argued that such an approach would not harm military targets, and that tactical air power, ground troops, and sea power were the elements necessary to defend the United States and Europe against attack. The Air Force countered that atomic weapons and long-range strategic bombers would deter war, but that if war nevertheless broke out, an immediate atomic offensive against the enemy would contribute to the success of surface actions and reduce U.S. casualties. Strategic bombing, the Air Force contended, provided the major counterbalance to the Soviet Union's vastly superior ground forces. In its final report, the House Armed Services Committee found no substance to the charges relating to Johnson's and Symington's roles in aircraft procurement. It held that evaluation of the B-36's worth was the responsibility of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group, and that the services jointly should not pass judgment on weapons proposed by one service. On cancellation of the supercarrier, the committee questioned the qualifications of the Army and Air Force chiefs of staff, who had testified in support of Johnson's decision, to determine vessels appropriate for the Navy. The committee, disapproving of Johnson's \\"summary manner\\" of terminating the carrier and failure to consult congressional committees before acting, stated that \\"national defense is not strictly an executive department undertaking; it involves not only the Congress but the American people as a whole speaking through their Congress. The committee can in no way condone this manner of deciding public questions.\\" The committee expressed solid support for effective unification, but stated that \\"there is such a thing as seeking too much unification too fast\\" and observed that \\"there has been a Navy reluctance in the interservice marriage, an over-ardent Army, a somewhat exuberant Air Force. ... It may well be stated that the committee finds no unification Puritans in the Pentagon.\\" Finally, the committee condemned the dismissal of Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, the Chief of Naval Operations, who accepted cancellation of the supercarrier but testified critically on defense planning and administration of unification. Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews fired Denfeld on October 27, 1949, explaining that he and Denfeld disagreed widely on strategic policy and unification. The House Armed Services Committee concluded that Denfeld's removal by Matthews was a reprisal because of Denfield's testimony and a challenge to effective representative government. Matthew's perceived vindictiveness towards much of the Navy's uniformed senior leadership during his tenure led to a perception by both the public and the U.S. Congress of the Navy's civilian leadership woes, a perception that also did not go totally unnoticed by the news media of the period. As The Washington Daily News reported at the time, \\"... Secretary of the Navy Matthews does not have the confidence of the Navy and can not win it ... Moreover, Mr. Matthews has forfeited the confidence of Congress by firing Admiral Denfeld.\\"Quoted in \\"Army and Navy Journal\\" 87, no. 10 (5 November 1949): 250. Matthews resigned as Secretary of the Navy in July 1951 to become Ambassador to Ireland. Although Johnson emerged from the Revolt of the Admirals with his reputation intact, the controversy weakened his position with the services and probably with the President. Notwithstanding Johnson's emphasis on unification, it was debatable how far it had really progressed, given the bitter recriminations exchanged by the Air Force and the Navy during the controversy, which went far beyond the initial question of the supercarrier to more fundamental issues of strategic doctrine, service roles and missions, and the authority of the secretary of defense. Moreover, Johnson's ill-conceived budget cutbacks on force readiness would soon bear bitter fruit with the coming of the Korean War. Most historians attribute Johnson's efforts to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, U.S. Naval Aviation in both the Navy and Marine Corps as one of the important factors in bringing about the invasion of South Korea, supported by both China and the Soviet Union. After the initial onslaught on to the Korean peninsula by North Korean forces, no air bases on the Korean peninsula were available for the U.S. Air Force to fight back from. As a result, all air support during those disastrous months came from Valley Forge, the only aircraft carrier left in the Western Pacific when South Korea was invaded. Valley Forge was soon joined by the other two aircraft carriers remaining in the Pacific. = The Cold War = Momentous international events that demanded difficult national security decisions also marked Johnson's term. The Berlin Crisis ended in May 1949, when the Russians lifted the blockade. Johnson pointed to the Berlin Airlift as a technological triumph important to the future of air cargo transportation and as an example of the fruits of unification. A week after Johnson took office, the United States and 11 other nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty, creating a regional organization that became the heart of a comprehensive collective security system. After initial reservations, Johnson supported the new alliance and the program of military assistance for NATO and other U.S. allies instituted by the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949). = NSC 68 = In August 1949, earlier than U.S. intelligence analysts had anticipated, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic device. This event and the almost concurrent retreat of the Kuomintang regime from mainland China hastened debate within the administration as to whether the United States should develop a hydrogen bomb. Initially, Johnson suspected -- despite confirming air samples -- that the Soviets had not really tested an atomic device at all. He theorized that perhaps an accidental laboratory explosion had occurred, and that no reassessments of U.S. defense capabilities were needed. Concluding that the hydrogen bomb was now required as deterrent as well as an offensive weapon, on January 31, 1950, Truman decided to proceed with development; Johnson supported the president's decision. Truman at the same time directed the Secretaries of State and Defense to review and reassess U.S. national security policy in the light of the Soviet atomic explosion, the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, and acquisition of the hydrogen bomb, and to produce a paper based on their new analysis. Johnson went about this task reluctantly, as he had promised Truman he would hold the line on increased defense spending. He was also upset that the State Department had first taken the lead on the policy assessment and had heavily influenced the contents of the resultant report NSC 68. Truman was less than enthused about the large defense cost projections for NSC-68 and its implications for existing domestic budgetary spending priorities, and initially sent it back without comment to its authors for further analysis. Although Truman took no immediate formal action on NSC 68, the paper gained considerable support when the North Koreans attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950. Johnson's obstinate attitude toward the State Department role in the preparation of this paper adversely affected his relations with both Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Truman. Although Johnson publicly professed belief that \\"the advance guard in the campaign for peace that America wages today must be the State Department,\\" his disagreements with Acheson and his restrictions on DoD contacts with the State Department persisted until the realities of the Korean War caused his fall from favor with the White House. = Failure in Korea = By 1950, Johnson had established a policy of faithfully following President Truman's defense economization policy, and had aggressively attempted to implement it even in the face of steadily increasing external threats posed by the Soviet Union and its allied Communist regimes. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks in Korea and the widespread reports of ill- equipped and inadequately trained U.S. military forces. Johnson's failure to adequately plan for U.S. conventional force commitments, to adequately train and equip current forces, or even to budget funds for storage of surplus Army and Navy war-fighting materiel for future use in the event of conflict would prove fateful after war broke out on the Korean Peninsula. Ironically, only the U.S. Marine Corps, whose commanders had stored and maintained their World War II surplus inventories of equipment and weapons, proved ready for deployment, though they still were woefully under-strengthWarren, James A., American Spartans: The U.S. Marines, New York: Simon & Schuster (2005), pp. 139-140: Repeated cuts in active-duty Fleet Marine Forces (FMF), planned combat deployments in the Atlantic and Persian Gulf (in the event of war with the Soviet Union), and 6th Fleet deployments in the Mediterranean left only the under-strength 4th Marine Division - a reserve unit - available for combat in the western Pacific. and in need of suitable landing craft to practice amphibious operations (Johnson had transferred most of the remaining craft from the Navy and reserved them for use in training Army units). As U.S. and South Korean forces lacked sufficient armor and artillery to repel the North Korean forces, Army and Marine Corps ground troops were instead committed to a series of costly rearguard actions as the enemy steadily progressed down the Korean peninsula, eventually encircling Busan.Zabecki, David T., Stand or Die - 1950 Defense of Korea's Pusan Perimeter, Military History (May 2009): The inability of U.S. forces to stop the initial North Korean offensive of 1950 cost the Eighth Army 4,280 killed in action, 12,377 wounded, 2,107 missing and 401 confirmed captured between July 5 and September 16, 1950, in addition to the lives of tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers and civilians.Lewis, Adrian R., The American culture of war, New York: Taylor & Francis Group, (2007), p. 82: Analyzing the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea through the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that \\"Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight ... from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... That we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.\\" The impact of the Korean War on Johnson's defense planning was glaringly evident in the Defense Department's original and supplemental budgetary requests for FY 1951. For that fiscal year, Johnson had at first supported Truman's recommendation of a $13.3 billion defense budget, but a month after the fighting in Korea started, the secretary hastily proposed a supplemental appropriation request of $10.5 billion, (an increase of 79%), bringing the total requested to $23.8 billion.McFarland, pp. 193-196 In making the additional request, Johnson informed a House appropriations subcommittee that \\"in light of the actual fighting that is now in progress, we have reached the point where the military considerations clearly outweigh the fiscal considerations.\\"McFarland, p. 315 U.S. reverses in Korea and the continued priority accorded to European security resulted in rapid, substantive changes in U.S. defense policies, including a long-term expansion of the armed forces and increased emphasis on military assistance to U.S. allies. In addition, Truman recoiled from Johnson's ‚Äúinordinate egotistical desire to run the whole government.‚ÄùMcCullough, p. 792. Truman later noted how Johnson had ‚Äúoffended every member of the cabinet. . . He never missed an opportunity to say mean things about my personal staff.‚Äù Ibid. Finally, concerned about public criticism of his handling of the Korean War, Truman decided to ask for Johnson's resignation. On September 19, 1950, Johnson resigned as Secretary of Defense, and the president quickly replaced him with General of the Army George C. Marshall.  Later years  His political career at an end, Johnson returned to his law practice, which he pursued until his death from a stroke in 1966 in Washington, D.C. at the age of 75. Johnson is buried at the Elkview Masonic Cemetery in Clarksburg, West Virginia. He was survived by his wife, Ruth Frances Maxwell Johnson and daughters Lillian and Ruth. In his last speech as Secretary of Defense, the day before he left office, Johnson made a reference to William Shakespeare's Macbeth: \\"When the hurly burly's done and the battle is won, I trust the historian will find my record of performance creditable, my services honest and faithful commensurate with the trust that was placed in me and in the best interests of peace and our national defense.\\"Shakespeare, William, Macbeth Act One, Scene One: \\"When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain? When the hurly-burly's done. When the battle's lost and won. That will be ere the set of sun ... Fair is foul, and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy air.\\" On December 7, 1950, The Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center was dedicated in honor of Louis A. Johnson. The medical center rests on a 16-acre site adjacent to the Veterans Memorial Park and the West Virginia State Nursing Home in the city of Clarksburg, West Virginia. This medical center has been an active teaching facility since 1960 by participating in residency and academic affiliations with West Virginia University, Fairmont State University, Alderson-Broaddus College and other nearby institutions of higher education.

For several centuries, Algerian music was dominated by styles inherited from Al-Andalus, eventually forming a unique North African twist on these poetic forms. Algerian music came to include suites called nuubaat (singular nuuba). Later derivatives include rabaab and hawzii. Genres Imarhan, Tuareg desert rock quintet Music in Algeria offers a rich diversity of genre: popular music (Chaabi), various genres of Andalusian classical music such as Sana'a, Gharnati music, Ma'luf, as well as classical Arabic, Bedouin, Berber music (Staifi, Ra√Ø, Kabyle, Shawi, Tuareg, Gnawa, etc.), Andalusian music is particularly well developed in Algeria, and is considered the most sophisticated by musical scholars - there exist three schools, the greatest number in the Maghreb region, and the performers invited to festivals across the Maghreb are usually of Algerian origin. Famous performers include Beihdja Rahal, Brahim Hadj Kacem, Nouri Koufi and Leila Borsali. Haouzi music is another style of Algerian music. It took the melodies of Andalusian music and modernized them. Haouzi music is most often played at weddings and ceremonies. Khaled known as Cheb Khaled, is considered as the King of Rai music, has achieved international fame, as Rai music is very popular in Algeria, Morocco France, Tunisia, Turkey, Libya, and Egypt. Staifi is a genre of music which began in Eu-eulma City, and is mostly played at weddings and celebrations, primarily featuring lyrics which symbolize purity and love. Chaabi refers to a style of recent urban popular music,inherited from the older Andalusian repertoire, of which the best known performer was El Hajj Muhammad El Anka, considered to be the Grand Master of Andalusian classical music. True styles of folk music include hofii, a form of female vocal music, and zindalii, from Constantine. Ra√Ø is a creative outlet to express love and romance; a mix between Western music and Bedouin music. Ma'luf is a genre of Andalusian classical music from Constantine which has survived because of the efforts of the Tunisian government and a few private individuals. Malouf is still performed in public, especially at weddings and circumcision ceremonies, though recordings are relatively rare.

Of the roster of stars who have played there, many have televised performances. While the theatre has a resident show, it is also able to host one off performances, such as concerts, TV specials and Christmas pantomimes since 2016. It has hosted the Royal Variety Performance 43 times, most recently in 2019. In March 2020, the venue closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on the theatre industry, but reopened over four months later on August 1, 2020. Architecture Walter Gibbons, an early moving-pictures manager, built the Palladium in 1910 to compete with Sir Edward Moss's London Hippodrome and Sir Oswald Stoll's London Coliseum. The facade (on the site of Argyll House, demolished in the 1860s,'Argyll Street Area', in Survey of London: Volumes 31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2, ed. F H W Sheppard (London, 1963), pp. 284‚Äì307. British History Online [accessed 10 April 2016. from which the pub opposite took the name The Argyll Arms), dates back to the 19th century. Formerly it was a temporary wooden building called Corinthian Bazaar, which featured an aviary and aimed to attract customers from the recently closed Pantheon Bazaar (now the site of Marks & Spencers) in Oxford Street. The theatre was rebuilt a year later by Fredrick Hengler, the son of a tightrope walker, as a circus arena for entertainments that included promenade concerts, pantomimes and an aquatic display in a flooded ring. It then became the National Skating Palace ‚Äì a skating rink with real ice. However, the rink failed and the Palladium was redesigned by Frank Matcham, a famous theatrical architect who also designed the Coliseum, on the site that had previously housed Hengler's Circus. The building now carries Heritage Foundation commemorative plaques honouring Lew Grade and Frankie Vaughan. The theatre retains many of its original features and was Grade II* listed in September 1960. The Palladium had its own telephone system so the occupants of boxes could call one another. It also had a revolving stage. History =Pre-First World War= The theatre started out as The Palladium, a premier venue for variety performances. Pantomimes were also featured there. In 1926, the pantomime starred Lennie Dean as Cinderella, footage of which remains to this day. The theatre is especially linked to the Royal Variety Performances, where many were, and still are, held. In 1928, for three months the Palladium also ran as a cinema. Following this 'Cine-Variety' episode the theatre fell dark for a short period in the autumn of 1928. =The George Black era= From 3 September 1928, the Palladium reopened under the directorship of the impresario/producer George Black as part of the General Theatre Corporation (GTC). When Black took control the theatre was close to bankruptcy. He revived its fortunes by returning to the original ethos of the Palladium by staging large variety shows, with a capital 'V' ‚Äì and as well as headlining Britain's homegrown acts he brought over big American stars such as Duke Ellington and his Orchestra, Adelaide Hall, Louis Armstrong and Ethel Waters for two-week engagements.‚ÄúGeorge Black producer and impresario biography‚Äù. Oxford Index.com. Retrieved 2 June 2020 Before too long, under Black's management the Palladium was soon gaining praise again as 'The World's Leading Variety Theatre'. In 1935, Black initiated the Crazy Gang revues at the Palladium (for which he is chiefly remembered) with Life Begins at Oxford Circus.‚ÄúGeorge Black biography‚Äù. Britannica. Retrieved 2 June 2020 The revues continued at the Palladium as an annual event until they transferred to the Victoria Palace theatre in 1940. Black managed the Palladium until his death in 1945. The climax of the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock spy thriller The 39 Steps was filmed at the Palladium. Second World War The theatre was hit by an unexploded German parachute mine on 11 May 1941. The device had fallen through the roof, becoming lodged over the stage. A Royal Navy bomb disposal team was sent to deal with it. After the mine was located, the fuse locking ring had to be turned to allow access to the fuse itself. Rather disconcertingly, the fuse began ticking as soon as it was touched. This caused a rapid evacuation of the immediate area, but the mine did not detonate. The two team members cautiously returned, extracted the fuse and removed other hazardous components, rendering the mine 'safe'. It was then lowered to the stage and disposed of. The George Medal for gallantry and undaunted devotion to duty was given to Sub Lieutenant Graham Maurice Wright for his action in the Palladium on that night. He was later killed, on 19 Aug 1941, while en route for Gibraltar on board the torpedoed troopship . =The Val Parnell era= Val Parnell took over as Managing Director after George Black's death in 1945. He adopted a controversial, but very successful, policy of presenting high-priced, big-name American acts at the top of the bill. Among many, the list included Carmen Miranda, Judy Garland, Sophie Tucker, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, the Andrews Sisters with Vic Schoen and his orchestra, Bob Hope, Liza Minnelli, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray, freezing out many British stars of the day, who were relegated to second-billing. From 1955 to 1967, the theatre was the setting for the top-rated ITV variety show Sunday Night at the London Palladium hosted first by Tommy Trinder, followed by Bruce Forsyth, Norman Vaughan, and Jimmy Tarbuck. The programme was broadcast live every week by ATV, which was owned by the famous theatrical impresario Lew Grade. Production was by Val Parnell. Six programmes aired as special episodes in the United States between May and August 1966 on NBC. British stars on the show included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Petula Clark, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles' publicist Tony Barrow said that after the band's first appearance on the show on 13 October 1963, Beatlemania took off in the UK. Their performance was watched by 15 million viewers. One national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \\"Beatlemania\\" to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles ‚Äì and it stuck.Pawlowski, Gareth L. (1990). How They Became The Beatles. p. 146. McDonald & Co (Publishers) Ltd. Parnell became associated with a property development company and began to sell Moss Empires' theatres for redevelopment. When it became known in 1966 that this fate awaited the London Palladium, The Victoria Palace and even the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Prince Littler organised a take-over to save the theatres and Val Parnell retired to live in France. The new Managing Director of Stoll-Moss was Louis Benjamin, who took on the role while continuing as MD of Pye Records within the ATV Group. By 1965, the Wine Society was operating out of a cellar under the Palladium. Additionally, it was also using one at Joiner Street under London Bridge Station and one at St James's Bond in Rotherhithe (which flooded at high tide). In 1968, Sammy Davis, Jr. starred in Golden Boy, the first book musical to be produced in the venue. A Johnny Cash album was recorded there in 1968, but Columbia Records never released it. Bootlegs of the performance are in circulation. =Post-Parnell= Bing Crosby at the Palladium in 1976. He released the album, Bing Crosby Live at the London Palladium, later that year. In December 1970, Dorothy Squires gave a concert at the Palladium. In January 1973, glam rock band Slade played a gig in the theatre which resulted in the venue's balcony nearly collapsing. In 1976, Marvin Gaye recorded a live concert at the venue. The performance documented on the resulting double LP, entitled Live at the London Palladium and released in 1977. In July 1974, singer Cass Elliott performed for two weeks. On the night of her final performance she died in her sleep in her rented flat in Mayfair. Also in 1974, Josephine Baker performed in the Royal Variety Performance. The 1991 film The Josephine Baker Story implied that, like Cass Elliott, she died after a show there, but this is not true. In 1981, the cellars of the Palladium housed a waxworks museum, aptly called \\"The Palladium Cellars\\", headlined by a Yul Bryner live projection automaton, as the cowboy Gunslinger from Westworld. In the late 1980s, the Palladium was once again the setting for the popular ITV1 variety show, Live From the Palladium, compered by Jimmy Tarbuck. During this time, the theatre was under the ownership of the Stoll Moss Theatres Group, and the management of Margaret and David Locke, who were both major shareholders of Stoll Moss at the time. In 1988, the Edinburgh Gang Show appeared as part of the British Musical Hall Society's Silver Jubilee. =Really Useful era= Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the Palladium in May 2004 In 2000, ownership of the theatre changed once again when Stoll Moss was acquired by Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. From 3 May 2000 to 5 January 2002, the Palladium played The King and I starring Elaine Paige and Jason Scott Lee. This production was a West End transfer of the hugely successful 1996 Broadway production. Before the opening, the box office had already taken in excess of ¬£7 million in ticket sales. This version of the show was a lavish affair, with new dialogue and music added, while the original material was updated. During the run, Josie Lawrence played the role of Anna and Paul Nakauchi and Keo Woolford played the role of the King, respectively. After the production closed, the famous (but outdated) revolving stage was removed to make way for more modern technology. From April 2002 to 4 September 2005, the Palladium played host to a theatrical version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang with songscore by the Sherman Brothers as a successor to The King & I. Throughout its three and a half year run at the venue, the production starred many celebrities (see below). This show proved to be the most successful in the theatre's long history and reunited, 50 years later, the show's choreographer Gillian Lynne, with the theatre in which she had appeared as the Palladium's Star Dancer during the early 50s. On 1 November 2004 and 22 November singer-songwriter Jackson Browne performed two concerts during his solo acoustic tour. For Christmas 2005‚Äì06, the venue staged Bill Kenwright's production of Scrooge ‚Äì The Musical which closed on 14 January 2006. The show starred Tommy Steele, making a return to the Palladium. From February 2006, the theatre played host to a new musical production entitled Sinatra At The London Palladium, which featured a live band, large screen projections and dancers performing Frank Sinatra's greatest hits. The Sound of Music at the Palladium in February 2007 Lloyd Webber and David Ian's production of The Sound of Music opened at the Palladium in November 2006. The production ran for just over two years, before closing on 21 February 2009. It starred Connie Fisher and Summer Strallen as Maria, Simon Shepherd, Alexander Hanson and Simon MacCorkindale as Captain Von Trapp and Lesley Garrett and Margaret Preece as the Mother Abbess. A production of Sister Act the Musical opened on 2 June 2009, starring Patina Miller as Deloris, Sheila Hancock as Mother Superior, Ian Lavender as Monsignor Howard, Chris Jarman as Shank, Ako Mitchell as Eddie, Katie Rowley Jones as Sister Mary Robert, Claire Greenway as Sister Mary Patrick and Julia Sutton as Sister Mary Lazarus. Rufus Wainwright held two sold out Judy Garland tribute concerts at the theatre on 18 and 25 February 2007. On 20 May 2007 the London Palladium hosted the 2007 BAFTA awards, which were broadcast on BBC television, and in 2010 the BAFTA Television Awards returned to the Palladium.Ant and Dec win first Bafta ITN, 7 June 2010 While the Theatre has a resident show, it is still able to have one off performances; this is enabled by the scenery of the resident show being designed to be easily removed. For example, the set of Sister Act was able to be hoisted completely above the stage out of view in an area called the Fly Loft. The London Palladium turned 100 years old on Boxing Day 2010, and a one- hour television special entitled '100 Years of the Palladium' aired on BBC Two on 31 December 2010. Sir Elton John performed at the venue in September 2013 in a special show where he was presented with the Brit Awards Icon, subsequently broadcast on ITV1. Robbie Williams promoted his new album Swings Both Ways, the UK's 1000th No. 1 album, with a one-night performance on 8 November 2013 that was filmed for television broadcast (BBC One). He was joined by members of the cast of The Muppet Show (Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Statler and Waldorf), Lily Allen, Rufus Wainwright, his father, a children's choir and a 30-piece orchestra. Invited guests included Adele and One Direction. The auditions of Britain's Got Talent at the Palladium in January 2019 Since 2013, excluding 2014, 2015 and 2016, Britain's Got Talent have held Judges' Auditions at the Palladium as one part of their Audition tour which usually lasts from mid-January to late-February. - BGT's use of the venues they use usually last approximately one week and is unique in that the production hire-out the venues and distribute tickets free-of- charge via Applause Store.

The book details Hemingway's first marriage to Hadley Richardson and his associations with other cultural figures of the Lost Generation in Interwar France. The memoir consists of various personal accounts by Hemingway and involves many notable figures of the time, such as Sylvia Beach, Hilaire Belloc, Bror von Blixen-Finecke, Aleister Crowley, John Dos Passos, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Pascin, Ezra Pound, Evan Shipman, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas and Hermann von Wedderkop. The work also references the addresses of specific locations such as bars, cafes, and hotels, many of which can still be found in Paris today. The memoir was published posthumously in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death, by his fourth wife and widow, Mary Hemingway, based upon his original manuscripts and notes. An edition altered and revised by his grandson, Se√°n Hemingway, was published in 2009. Background In November 1956, Hemingway recovered two small steamer trunks that he had stored in March 1928 in the basement of the H√¥tel Ritz Paris. The trunks contained notebooks he had filled during the 1920s. Hemingway's friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who was with him in Paris in 1956, later recounted the occasion of Hemingway's recovery of the trunks and notebooks: Having recovered his trunks, Hemingway had the notebooks transcribed, and then began working them up into the memoir that would eventually become A Moveable Feast. After Hemingway's death in 1961, his widow Mary Hemingway, in her capacity as his literary executor, made final copy-edits to the manuscript prior to its publication in 1964. In a \\"Note\\" with which she prefaced the posthumously published 1964 edition of the work, she wrote: Gerry Brenner, a literary scholar at the University of Montana, and other researchers have examined Hemingway's notes and the initial drafts of A Moveable Feast, which are in the collection of Ernest Hemingway's personal papers opened to the public in 1979, following the completion of the John F. Kennedy Library, where they are held in Boston. In a paper titled \\"Are We Going to Hemingway's Feast?\\" (1982), Brenner undertook to document Mary Hemingway's editing process and questioned its validity. He concluded that some of her changes were misguided, and others derived from questionable motives. He also suggested that the changes appeared to contradict Mary's stated policy for her role as executor, which had been to maintain a \\"hands off\\" approach. Brenner states that Mary changed the order of the chapters in Hemingway's final draft, apparently to \\"preserve chronology\\". This change interrupted the series of juxtaposed character sketches of such individuals as Sylvia Beach, owner of the bookstore Shakespeare & Company, and Gertrude Stein. The chapter titled \\"Birth of a New School\\", which Hemingway had dropped from his draft, was reinserted by Mary. Brenner alleges the most serious change was the deletion of Hemingway's lengthy apology to his first wife, Hadley. This apology appeared in various forms in every draft of the book. Brenner suggests that Mary deleted it because it impugned her own role as his wife. In contrast, Hotchner has said that he received a near final draft of A Moveable Feast in 1959, and that the version Mary Hemingway published is essentially the draft he had read then. In his view, the original 1964 publication is the version that Hemingway intended, and Mary Hemingway did not revise or add chapters on her own initiative, but simply carried out Ernest's intentions. Hotchner describes Hemingway's memoir as \\"a serious work\\", that Hemingway \\"certainly intended it for publication\\", and contends: \\"Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest‚Äôs estate, she had little involvement with the book.... What I read on the plane coming back from Cuba [in 1959] was essentially what was published. There was no extra chapter created by Mary. Source of title The title of A Moveable Feast (a play on words for the term used for a holy day for which the date is not fixed) was suggested by Hemingway's friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who remembered Hemingway using the term in 1950. Hotchner's recollection of what Hemingway had said became the source of the epigraph on the title page for the posthumously published work in 1964. The term had also been used earlier out of its traditional religious context by Albert Camus in his novel The Stranger (1942): \\"Masson remarked that we'd had a very early lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, one had it when one felt like it.\\" Chapters The 1964 edition of Hemingway's Paris memoir consists of a \\"Preface\\" by Hemingway (pg. ix), a \\"Note\\" by his widow (pg. xi), and 20 chapters, or individual parts or sections. Each of the chapters can be read as a stand-alone piece or entity, not dependent upon the context of the whole work, nor necessarily arranged in any chronological order‚Äîwith titles descriptive of the subject matter of each, as follows:Hemingway, Ernest - A Moveable Feast, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1964. ::* \\"A Good Caf√© on the Place St.-Michel\\" ::* \\"Miss Stein Instructs\\" ::* \\"Une G√©n√©ration Perdue\\" ::* \\"Shakespeare and Company\\" ::* \\"People of the Seine\\" ::* \\"A False Spring\\" ::* \\"The End of an Avocation\\" ::* \\"Hunger Was Good Discipline\\" ::* \\"Ford Madox Ford and the Devil's Disciple\\" ::* \\"Birth of a New School\\" ::* \\"With Pascin at the D√¥me\\" ::* \\"Ezra Pound and His Bel Esprit\\" ::* \\"A Strange Enough Ending\\" ::* \\"The Man Who Was Marked for Death\\" ::* \\"Evan Shipman at the Lilas\\" ::* \\"An Agent of Evil\\" ::* \\"Scott Fitzgerald\\" ::* \\"Hawks Do Not Share\\" ::* \\"A Matter of Measurements\\" ::* \\"There Is Never Any End to Paris\\" Publishing history The first published edition was edited from Hemingway's manuscripts and notes by his fourth wife and widow, Mary Hemingway, and published posthumously in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death. In 2009 a new edition, titled the \\"Restored Edition\\", was published by Se√°n Hemingway, assistant curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and grandson of Hemingway and Pauline Pfeiffer. He made numerous changes: * The previous introductory letter by Hemingway, pieced together from various fragments by Mary Hemingway, was removed. * The chapter called \\"Birth of a New School\\" and large sections of \\"Ezra Pound and the Measuring Worm\\" and \\"There is Never Any End to Paris\\" (which has been renamed as \\"Winter in Schruns\\" and moved to chapter 16) had sections previously left out that have been re-added. The unpublished \\"The Pilot Fish and the Rich\\" has been added. * Chapter 7 (\\"Shakespeare and Company\\") has been moved to be chapter 3, and chapter 16 (\\"Nada y Pues Nada\\") has been moved to the end of the book as an \\"Additional Paris Sketch\\". * Hemingway's use of the second person has been restored in many places, a change which Se√°n asserts \\"brings the reader into the story\\". From the new foreword by Patrick Hemingway: > \\"[H]ere is the last bit of professional writing by my father, the true > foreword to A Moveable Feast: 'This book contains material from the remises > of my memory and of my heart. Even if the one has been tampered with and the > other does not exist'.\\"Hemingway, Se√°n (ed.) (2009), p. xiv  Reception  = Preserved video of two critical reactions from 1964 = The basic cable channel GSN has rebroadcast the kinescope of an appearance that Sheilah Graham made on the American television show What's My Line? 23 years after the death of her boyfriend F. Scott Fitzgerald. She appeared on an episode that was telecast live on CBS on June 7, 1964, when A Moveable Feast was on bestseller lists. Graham appeared on the show to promote a book she had written, and she did not bring up A Moveable Feast. Bennett Cerf, the head of Random House publishing who was also a regular panelist on the network television series, initiated talk of Hemingway's new bestselling book. Cerf, who was two years younger than Fitzgerald and one year older than Hemingway, had the following exchange with Graham, according to the kinescope of the telecast that is available for viewing on YouTube. = Reactions to the 2009 edition = A.E. Hotchner alleged, among his other criticisms of the 2009 edition, that Se√°n Hemingway had edited it, in part, to exclude references to his grandmother (Hemingway's second wife Pauline Pfeiffer) that he found less than flattering. As Hotchner's over-all assessment of the 2009 edition, he wrote: > \\"Ernest was very protective of the words he wrote, words that gave the > literary world a new style of writing. Surely he has the right to have these > words protected against frivolous incursion, like this reworked volume that > should be called ‚ÄúA Moveable Book‚Äù. Other critics also have found fault with some of Se√°n Hemingway's editorial changes. Irene Gammel writes about the new edition: \\"Ethically and pragmatically, restoring an author's original intent is a slippery slope when the published text has stood the test of time and when edits have been approved by authors or their legal representatives.\\" Pointing to the complexity of authorship, she concludes: ‚ÄúMary's version should be considered the definitive one, while the 'restored' version provides access to important unpublished contextual sources that illuminate the evolution of the 1964 edition.‚Äù  Legacy  =Adaptations= On September 15, 2009, Variety reported that Mariel Hemingway, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, had acquired the film and television rights to the memoir with American film producer John Goldstone. In 2019, it was reported that a television series was being developed through Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, but there was no planned release date. =Cultural references= In films * The comedy film The Moderns (1988) brings the characters of The Moveable Feast to life while spoofing the pretense of the Lost Generation. * The book is featured in the movie, City of Angels (1998), during an exchange between Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. * Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris is set in the Paris of the 1920s as portrayed in Hemingway's book, and the movie features the Owen Wilson character interacting with the likes of Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and uses the phrase \\"a moveable feast\\" in two instances. * The Words (2012) uses an excerpt from A Moveable Feast to represent a book manuscript found in an old messenger bag. * In the American superhero film, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), one of the books on the shelf in the character Steve Rogers' apartment is Hemingway's A Moveable Feast. * In the American film, French Postcards (1979), a character quotes the epigraph from the book in order to convince a fellow American student who is studying in France with him to not only study, but enjoy life in Paris. * In the American comedy film, Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008), a stripper named Tits Hemingway says she got the latter part of her name because her favorite novel is A Moveable Feast. In literature * The writer Enrique Vila-Matas named his book Never Any End to Paris (2003) after the final chapter of Hemingway's work. In stage performances * In his early stand-up performances in the late 1960s, Woody Allen performed a routine wherein he riffed the feel of the then recently published book while describing imaginary times spent with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, and Gertrude Stein with the repeated punch line: \\"And Hemingway punched me in the mouth.\\" =Revival in France= Following the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, A Moveable Feast became a bestseller in France. In the context of the attacks, the book's French-language title, Paris est une f√™te, was a potent symbol of defiance and celebration. Bookstore sales of the volume surged, and copies of the book became a common fixture among the flowers and candles in makeshift memorials created by Parisians across the city to honor victims of the attacks. = Hemingway's Wine = In his memoir, A Moveable Feast, Hemingway shows what life was like for aspiring writers in Paris. He talks about his friendships with Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, his first marriage and their life in the Latin Quarter, and his writing routine in Parisian cafes. His love of good wine shines through as he never fails to mention which wine he enjoyed with his friends and what they ate with it. Wine was entirely entwined with the writer's lifestyle in Paris. * Sancerre: A False Spring, \\"Another day later that year when we had come back from one of our voyages and had good luck at some track again we stopped at Prunier's on the way home, going in to sit at the bar after looking at the clearly priced wonders in the window. We had oysters and crab mexicane with glasses of Sancerre.\\" * M√¢con: Scott Fitzgerald, \\"We had a marvellous lunch from the hotel at Lyon, an excellent truffled roast chicken, delicious bread and white M√¢con wine and Scott was very happy when we drank the white Maconnais at each of our stops. At M√¢con I had bought four more bottles of excellent wine which I uncorked as we needed them.\\" *Corsican: With Pascin at the D√¥me, \\"At home, over the sawmill, we had a Corsican wine that had a great authority and a low price. It was a very Corsican wine and you could dilute it by half with water and still receive its message.\\" * Cahors: With Pascin at the D√¥me, \\"At the Negre de Toulouse we drank the good Cahors wine from the quarter, the half or the full carafe, usually diluting it about one-third with water.[...] In Paris, then, you could live very well on almost nothing and by skipping meals occasionally and never buying any new clothes, you could save and have luxuries.\\" In September 2020, Chiswick Book Festival featured a wine and literature event celebrating Hemingway's Wine in A Moveable Feast presented by Victoria Daskal.

Squamish Five carried out a political campaign of \\"direct actions\\", including the Litton Industries bombing, Litton Industries being the manufacturer of guidance systems for American nuclear cruise missiles. Hannah was convicted of conspiracy to rob an armoured car and possession of a stolen weapon, for which he received a ten-year jail sentence. He was released after serving five years of his sentence. While in jail, he recorded two records, Songs from the Underground (folk) and Whereabouts Unknown (electronic), both now very hard to find. Hannah was a member of the Vancouver-based punk rock band, The Subhumans, from 1978 to 1981. He reunited with his ex-bandmates for a few shows in the 1990s and again between 2005 and 2010. The Subhumans were best known for their 1980 album Incorrect Thoughts. Hannah penned at least three classics of the punk genre, \\"Slave to my Dick\\", \\"Oh Canaduh\\", and \\"Fuck You\\". The Subhumans released New Dark Age Parade in 2006 and Death was too Kind in 2008. Same Thoughts, Different Day, a re-recorded version of Incorrect Thoughts, came out in 2010. In December 2014, Hannah released a solo indie folk-rock record Coming Home. The album is a re-recording of selected tracks from Songs from Underground with some additional material. Most of the songs were written during his time with Direct Action and his imprisonment. In 2004, Vancouver filmmaker, Glen Sanford, made a documentary movie about Gerry Hannah, called Useless. Hannah was also one of the interview subjects in Bloodied But Unbowed, Susanne Tabata's 2011 documentary about Vancouver's early punk scene.

Hardcore punk, hip hop, country, and heavy metal have all appeared in California. Furthermore, new genres of music, such as surf rock and third wave ska, have their origins in California. Official symbols The official state song of California is \\"I Love You, California\\", written by F. B. Silverwood and composed by Alfred F. Frankenstein of the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra. It was designated the state song in 1951. Other songs, including \\"California, Here I Come\\", have also been candidates for additional state songs since 1951, but in 1988 the official standing of \\"I Love You, California\\" was confirmed. California also has an official fife and drum band, the California Consolidated Drum Band, which was so designated in 1997. The state's official folk dance is the square dance, which has been found in California since at least the Gold Rush. Indigenous music Many groups of Indigenous peoples of California lived and continue to live within the current geographic boundaries of California, before and since colonization by Europe. In the late 19th century, American Indian music began to be incorporated by classical composers throughout the country, known as the Indianist movement. In San Francisco, Carlos Troyer published compositions like Apache Chief Geronimo's Own Medicine song, with a piano accompaniment by Troyer. Early foreign influences The earliest Spanish and English explorers in California encountered Native Americans and established missions to convert them to Christianity. Chanted prayers and hymns were often used, and choirs were eventually formed; many missions formed Native American choirs among recent converts. As California's European, Asian, and African population increased in the 19th century, the state became the earliest West Coast territory admitted to the United States. As on the East Coast, music at the time was dominated by popular minstrel shows and the sale of sheet music. Performers included the Sacramento-born Hyers Sisters and Black Patti. Chinese immigrants came to California to work on the transcontinental railroad and soon became a large minority in the state; the San Francisco Chinese Opera House was built in 1880. However, two years later the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in order to prevent more immigration. The visit of King Kalakaua of Hawaii in 1874 saw the Hawaiian national anthem, \\"Hawaii Ponoi\\" (written by the king) set to music by Henri Berger. In the 1880s, Carlos Troyer became a prominent composer, incorporating Spanish and Zuni influences. Polish composer Anton de Kontski's \\"Polish Patrol\\" and \\"Awakening the Lion\\" were also quite popular. =Spanish and Mexican influence= Manuela Garc√≠a was the most prolific performer recorded by Charles Fletcher Lummis The state's large Mexican population brought traditional folk guitar to California, including virtuoso Luis T. Romero. The Spanish missions in California brought European music to the area. From the late 18th century to the late 19th century, many visitors to California remarked on the uniqueness of the Spanish language music in California. This music was distinctively Californian, different from both Mexican and Spanish music of the time (though many elements are found throughout these traditions). With the arrival of many Americans from the East Coast, as well as immigrants from as far away as China, however, Spanish folk music began to dwindle in popularity in California. Charles Fletcher Lummis, himself an immigrant to California, recorded many kinds of Spanish and Native American folk music for the Southwest Society of the Archaeological Institute of America. Later in the 20th century, other revivalists like Gabriel Eulogius Ruiz and Al Pill helped keep Spanish-California traditions alive. Mexican and Latin American music in California today Because of its historical and cultural connections to Mexico and strong Hispanic influences, California hosts numerous Spanish language radio stations, variety music shows and local based Mariachi and Mexican folk music bands. Popular music such as Ranchera, Norte√±o, son music can be heard on many radio stations across the state from the San Francisco Bay Area to the southern end of the Central Valley. Among the most celebrated Mexican American singers from California are Jenni Rivera, Carlos Santana, Chris Montez and Ritchie Valens. Southern California has been home to Spanish language singers and musicians for over 100 years. La Pena Cultural Center in Berkeley has worked promote Salsa and traditional Latin American music to encourage a strong cultural connection between Californians and Latin Americans. Reggaeton is becoming popular in California due to the success of rappers Daddy Yankee, Pitbull, and Ruben Blades who have broken across language barriers into mainstream music. Reggaeton dance clubs can be found in Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Chula Vista. Fusing reggaeton with hip hop music has ensured the genre's popularity among both young and old aficionados of Latin music. Salsa music has had success as popular dance music since the early 1980s. Its popularity continues due to popular music shows So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing with the Stars. Local Salsa and Caribbean music groups regularly perform in San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles Area. Grammy award winning band La Santa Cecilia formed in Los Angeles in 2009. 1930s and 40s Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnographer from San Francisco, collected a trove of American folk songs for the WPA Northern California Folk Music Project (1938‚Äì1940), which she initiated. =West Coast blues= =Western swing= 1950s and 60s =Bakersfield sound= In the 1950s and early 1960s, country music was dominated by the slick Nashville sound that stripped the genre of its gritty roots. The town of Bakersfield saw the rise of the Bakersfield sound as a reaction against Nashville, led by people such as Buck Owens and future star Merle Haggard. =Folk= California was an important part of the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s, led by the San Francisco Bay Area group the Kingston Trio. Their first hit, the 1958 single \\"Tom Dooley\\" (a Billboard #1 Hot 100 hit), sold more than 3 million copies and inspired the addition of a \\"folk\\" category to the Grammy awards the following year. The Trio's success inspired many pop- folk groups (recognizable by the performance of traditional or traditional- sounding music and use of acoustic rather than electric guitars), including California-based The Limeliters. California venues like the Hungry i promoted the genre and several major albums were recorded there. Folk music faded in popularity after the mid-1960s British Invasion, but merged with the British sound to create folk rock, pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds. =R&B;= R&B; group the Robins formed in San Francisco and helped establish the doo-wop sound. Members of the Robins went on to form the Coasters in Los Angeles, alongside the Platters, the Penguins, the Flairs, the Cadets, the Hollywood Flames, and the Blossoms. Johnny Otis was born in Vallejo. Etta James was born in Los Angeles. =Chicano rock= Chicano artists Ritchie Valens, the Champs, Cannibal & the Headhunters, thee Midniters, the Premiers, the Blendells, and El Chicano emerged from southern California in this period. =Pop= Vocal group the Lennon Sisters formed in Venice. The Walker Brothers, formed in Los Angeles in 1964, achieved success in the United Kingdom during the British Invasion. =Surf rock, sunshine pop, and the California Sound= In the early 1960s, youth in southern California became enamored with surf rock groups, many instrumental, like the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, the Chantays, Royale Monarchs, the Honeys, the Bel-Airs, the Challengers, and the Surfaris. Surf rock is said to have been invented by Dick Dale with his 1961 (see 1961 in music) album Let's Go Trippin'. Surf rock's popularity ended in the mid-1960s with the coming of psychedelic music, however bands like Papa Doo Run Run have continued to perform and tour for the last 40 years. =Garage rock= The Standells, the Seeds, the Leaves, and the Music Machine formed in the Los Angeles area. Count Five, Syndicate of Sound, and the Chocolate Watchband formed in San Jose. =Psychedelic rock= The late 1960s saw San Francisco rise as the center for psychedelic rock and a mecca for hippies. Haight-Ashbury became a countercultural capital, and bands like Jefferson Airplane, Loading Zone, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Ace of Cups, Country Joe and the Fish, Santana, the Charlatans, Big Brother & the Holding Company, and the Grateful Dead helped to launch the blues- and folk- rock scene; other bands, like Moby Grape and the Flamin' Groovies used a more country-influenced sound, while Cold Blood and Sons of Champlin incorporated R&B; and Orkustra played a sort of free-form psychedelia. Of all these bands, the Grateful Dead were undoubtedly the longest-lasting of all. They continued recording and performing for several decades under the leadership of Jerry Garcia, experimenting with a wide variety of folk, country, and bluegrass, and becoming a part of the jam band phenomenon. Hollywood's Sunset Strip area produced bands like the Byrds, the Doors, Love, Buffalo Springfield, Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the Seeds. The Byrds went on to become a major folk-rock act, helping to popularize some of Bob Dylan's compositions and eventually launching the careers of folk-rockers like David Crosby and country-rock fusionist Gram Parsons. Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, both from Antelope Valley, started their aggressively experimental music careers during the late 1960s. The band Iron Butterfly is another noted California psychedelic band, coming out of San Diego. San Francisco psychedelic scene This era began in about 1965, when The Matrix, the first folk club in San Francisco, opened; Jefferson Airplane, then a newly formed and unknown band, performed that night. Later that year, a band known as the Warlocks became the Grateful Dead, performing at The Fillmore, which was to become a major musical venue in the area. Jefferson Airplane became the first San Francisco psychedelic band signed to a major label, followed soon after by Sopwith Camel. In 1966, the first acid test was held, and the use of the drug LSD became a more prominent part of psychedelic rock, and music in general. One of the first albums from the scene was Country Joe and the Fish's Electric Music for the Mind and Body (1967). A year later, the band Blue Cheer released Vincebus Eruptum, which launched a national hit with a cover of Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues\\"; Blue Cheer is now regarded as a progenitor of heavy metal. =Experimental= The San Francisco Tape Music Center was founded in 1962 by composers Morton Subotnick, born in Los Angeles, and Ramon Sender. Under a commission, synthesizer pioneer Don Buchla, born in South Gate, created his first modular synthesizer in 1963 and started Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments. 1970s and 80s The early part of this era was dominated by country rock acts such as the Eagles and Poco, and singer- songwriters such as Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell. There were also funk acts that were prominent such as War from the South Central (now South) district of Los Angeles, Sly and the Family Stone and Tower of Power from Oakland. Santana blended rock, jazz, funk and Latin music. Latin R&B; band Tierra formed in Los Angeles in this period. This period also saw a number of difficult to classify acts arising who did not sell many records, but proved to be very influential on things to come, such as Kim Fowley, Captain Beefheart, Sparks, and Fanny, all from Los Angeles, who had been active in the 1960s but reached their artistic peaks during this era. Fowley would go on to manage and produce the all-female punk-metal group, the Runaways. The Los Angeles scene of this period also produced the Go-Go's and the Motels. Boundary-stretching singer-songwriters such as Rickie Lee Jones and Warren Zevon (both originally from Chicago but whose careers developed in California) emerged to great critical acclaim. The Tubes, who mixed progressive rock with wild theatricality, and Journey, formed from among some of Carlos Santana's sidemen and eventually experiencing a peak as one of the most popular AOR acts in the United States, were virtually the only acts from San Francisco to gain any sort of fame in the mid-1970s. During the 1980s, Journey found further success, as did Huey Lewis and the News who combined elements of pub rock with doo-wop and soul, and Starship which formed from its earlier incarnation of Jefferson Starship. Californians Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s and were a key part of the band's multi-platinum success. =Punk rock in California= Los Angeles Los Angeles' original late 1970s punk scene received less press attention than their counterparts in New York or London, but it included cult bands the Screamers, the Germs, the Weirdos, the Dils, the Bags, 45 Grave (founded by Paul B. Cutler), Nervous Gender, and X. Other Los Angeles-area punk and hardcore groups of the era include Wasted Youth, T.S.O.L., L7, Los Illegals, the Plugz, Cruzados, the Brat, the Controllers, the Hollywood Squares, Super Heroines, the Pandoras, the Droogs, Catholic Discipline, the Mau-Mau's, VOM, Dr. Know (featuring former child star Brandon Cruz), Legal Weapon, Claw Hammer, the Mentors (originally from Seattle), along with future underground stars NOFX. South Bay In the Los Angeles South Bay, American hardcore punk was born with bands like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Minutemen and Youth Brigade, who formed in the mid-1970s to early 1980s. SST Records was started by Greg Ginn of Black Flag in Long Beach in 1978. San Pedro, Hermosa Beach, Wilmington, Manhattan Beach, and Hawthorne spawned more locally famous acts like Red Cross (who would later incorporate garage rock, power pop, and glam influences into their sound and change their name to Redd Kross), the Last, Circle Jerks, Saint Vitus, the Descendents, and Saccharine Trust. The famous movie about the hardcore scene, The Decline of Western Civilization, was shot in this area, largely in an abandoned church in Hermosa called the Creative Craft Center. The movement fell out of popularity around the mid 1980s. The late 1980s/early 1990s saw a revival in the South Bay punk scene with punk bands like Bad Religion, Down by Law, NOFX, the Offspring, Pennywise, and Ten Foot Pole under the Epitaph Records label. San Fernando Valley Youth Brigade founded BYO Records in 1982 in Sun Valley. Also of note is the band Bad Religion, who hailed from the western San Fernando Valley and were only marginally associated with hardcore punk rock from the South Bay area. The punk scene in the eastern San Fernando Valley was closely tied in with that of nearby Hollywood and produced bands such as the Dickies, Fear, and the Angry Samoans. The bands Iconoclast and Public Nuisance also hailed from this area. Numerous punks shows in the 1980s, including shows by Circle Jerks and Black Flag, took place in a warehouse on the old site of Devonshire Downs in Northridge. Orange County In Orange County, the band Middle Class, from Santa Ana, was probably the most influential; their \\"Out of Vogue\\" is sometimes considered the first hardcore recording. The original hardcore bands in Orange County came from the Fullerton area, where the Adolescents, Agent Orange, Social Distortion, and D.I. formed. Social Distortion would later incorporate blues, country, and early rock influences into their sound and become one of America's premier roots rock bands. Farther south, Huntington Beach was also an influential center of hardcore, and is known as the origin of slam dancing. Huntington band T.S.O.L. had a reputation for being aggressive and sometimes violent, while Uniform Choice became known as a prominent straight edge band from the West Coast. Another Orange County band of note is the U.S. Bombs fronted by Duane Peters. True Sounds of Liberty (TSOL) was perhaps the most infamous for violence, and for an abrupt and unpopular change towards proto-Gothic rock and, much later, Aerosmith-style heavy metal as the scene developed; future underground stars the Vandals evolved from TSOL's eventual breakdown. Other Orange County bands included Channel 3 (CH3), White Mice, the Offspring, Big Drill Car, Guttermouth, Suicidal Tendencies (who were from Venice but were associated with Orange County hardcore), China White and Shattered Faith. The Dils were originally from Orange County but later relocated to San Francisco. The area had a big hand in the third wave ska scene with this region giving rise to Save Ferris, Reel Big Fish, and the scenes' most well-known act the Gwen Stefani-fronted No Doubt who would go on to pop super-stardom. San Diego The Zeros formed in Chula Vista in 1976. The Neutrons gained limited success, eventually changing their name to Battalion of Saints. The Donkey Show was a ska band that saw some notoriety during the late 1980s, helping to establish the genre known as third wave ska. San Francisco Outside of New York, London, and Cleveland, San Francisco probably had the earliest punk scene, at least as far back as 1976. The scene was aided by San Francisco's famously laid back attitude towards alternative lifestyles, and the legendary record label Alternative Tentacles. Crime and the Nuns were first, followed by Chrome, the Mutants, the Units, the Contractions, Angst, the Sleepers, Pop-O-Pies, Frightwig, Crucifix, Negative Trend, the Avengers, Toiling Midgets, Flipper and Romeo Void. The most influential San Francisco hardcore band was Dead Kennedys, whose frontman, Jello Biafra, became a noted social activist. Many hardcore bands moved to San Francisco, including legends MDC, as well as D.R.I., Tales of Terror (from Sacramento, who made Kurt Cobain's Top 50 list of favorite bands and essential listening), the Dicks, and Rhythm Pigs (all from Texas). Berkeley Berkeley experienced a hardcore boom led by Fang. Berkeley also saw hardcore fusing with heavy metal to form thrash metal and bands like Possessed, Faith No More, Metallica, and Exodus. Also in the mid-late 1980s hardcore, pop punk, and ska punk bands gained a following with bands such as Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine, The Mr. T Experience, the Lookouts, Isocracy, Green Day, Blatz, and Plaid Retina. These bands played at the infamous Gilman Street Project and released records on Lookout! Records. San Jose San Jose's most famous hardcore band was the Faction, who played with local bands such as Los Olvidados. It is also from where some members of Rancid hailed. Punk rock band No Use for a Name is also from San Jose. =Heavy metal= Glam metal Glam metal arose along the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in the 1980s with bands like Quiet Riot, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, and later Pennsylvania immigrants Poison and quickly became known for anthemic hard rock and power ballads, as well as band members' distinctively feminine make-up, hair, and clothing in spite of the scene's macho posturing. This scene would die out in the 1990s due to grunge. Thrash metal The Bay Area thrash scene was centered around Los Angeles and San Francisco in the 1980s and 1990s. Bands associated with this scene include Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Exodus, Vio-lence, Suicidal Tendencies, Dark Angel, Death Angel, D.R.I., Testament, Forbidden, Defiance, Evildead, and Holy Terror. =Alternative rock= Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth grew up in Los Angeles, where she attended Otis Art Institute, before moving to New York. Wall of Voodoo multiple-drum-machine and Farfisa organ laden recordings with wild guitars and clever and desert wise road lyrics out of central Hollywood Boulevard and Selma Avenue wild life started the New wave trend in Southern California late 1970s early 1980s. The Cretones added power pop guitar riffs and thoughtful lyrics with a touch of humor and sarcasm in the late 1970s early 1980s. They attracted the attention of Linda Ronstadt, who recorded three of their songs on her new wave album Mad Love, titled after the Cretones' song. At the same time that gothic rock began in the United Kingdom, a parallel death rock scene evolved in Los Angeles out of the punk scene, with bands like 45 Grave and Christian Death. Inspired by bands like the Gun Club and Ohio transplants the Cramps, cowpunk bands such as Tex & the Horseheads, and Blood on the Saddle arose from Los Angeles in the 1980s. The Paisley Underground scene would arise out of Los Angeles in the mid-1980s around Redd Kross, The Three O'Clock (originally The Salvation Army), the Bangles, the Dream Syndicate, the Long Ryders, Rain Parade, Opal, Mazzy Star, and others. Faith No More and Primus formed in San Francisco in the 80s. Los Angeles' Red Hot Chili Peppers steadily built up media attention with their first recordings in the mid-to- late-1980s, and went on to become one of the world's premier rock bands in the following decade. Santa Cruz spawned Camper Van Beethoven in the mid-1980s. Jane's Addiction would arise out of Venice in the late 1980s. =Experimental= The Los Angeles Free Music Society was formed in 1973 and produced the group Smegma. =Hip hop= During the 1980s, hip hop music flourished in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, especially Watts and Compton. Derived from New York City, hip hop drew upon primarily Jamaican and East Coast influences, though early 1970s black nationalist poets the Watts Prophets were also notable. The earliest forms of Los Angeles hip hop were hardcore hip hop artists like Ice-T (whose mid-80s \\"6 in the Mornin'\\" is arguably the first West Coast gangsta rap track). Among the most popular electro hop groups was the World Class Wrecking Cru, which included future star Dr. Dre, DJ Yela, and others and also featured singer Michel'le, an early pioneer in combining soulful R&B; singing with hip-hop beats. In 1988, Dr. Dre, along with Eazy-E and Ice Cube, released Straight Outta Compton under the name N.W.A The album took many hip hop fans by surprise, as it single-handedly placed West Coast hip hop on the map and quickly moved gangsta rap into the mainstream. The main gangsta rap and west coast hip hop cities were Long Beach, San Francisco, Oakland, Vallejo, Pittsburg, California Sacramento, Richmond, California, East Palo Alto, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Fresno, Compton, and Inglewood. 1990s and 2000s =Hip hop= Called \\"The Golden Age of Hip hop\\", the 1990s saw the rise of such legendary rappers as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eazy-E, Yo-Yo, 2Pac, and Ice Cube, as well as the group Cypress Hill.Central California Hip Hop sites.google.com 04-05-2015 Retrieved. 04-05-2015 In the 1990s Ice Cube released six albums and the first five albums all went platinum, and the last one, War & Peace, went gold. Cube became an icon for West Coast hip hop for his songs about social and political issues. In 1992, Dr. Dre's solo debut, The Chronic, made West Coast hip hop and Death Row Records the dominant sound in hip hop, drawing primarily upon George Clinton's P-Funk for samples and the general, slow, lazy funk, which G-funk music was founded in Los Angeles and Long Beach. Death Row Records soon acquired Tupac Shakur, Warren G and Snoop Doggy Dogg as a feud developed between the East and West Coasts. In the mid-90s, Shakur and his rival Notorious B.I.G. were both shot and killed. Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight was imprisoned, and most of the label's acts tried to leave. The lack of leadership helped put New York, Atlanta, and New Orleans on the top of the hip hop charts, leaving local would-be legends and underground MC's (emcees) to work under self-financed productions. In the 1990s, underground hip hop flourished in the San Francisco Bay Area. Early pioneers included Too Short and E-40; their success helped pave the way for new performers like RBL Posse, whose 1992 \\"Don't Gimme No Bammer\\" achieved some crossover success. The Bay Area's thriving underground rap scene has produced literally hundreds of artists, some of the better known being Andre Nickatina, the Coup, Michael Franti, the Conscious Daughters, Paris, Blackalicious, Ya Boy, San Quinn, and Emcee Lynx. The Bay Area is also home to the relatively new \\"Hyphy\\" subgenre. Mac Dre was one of the notable innovators. San Francisco was very impressive in hip hop, boasting west coast legends Rappin' 4-Tay, RBL Posse, Andre Nickatina, JT The Bigga Figga, Cougnut, and more. San Francisco and Oakland were some of the homes of the late global rapping legend Tupac Shakur. The inner-city of San Francisco's neighborhoods' crime inspired the rap scene of San Francisco. Madlib and brother Oh No were born in Oxnard. Dilated Peoples, Jurassic 5, and Flying Lotus are from Los Angeles. The Alchemist is from Beverly Hills. Chicano rap artists Frost, A Lighter Shade of Brown, Psycho Realm, Brownside, Lil Rob, Serio, and Proper Dos emerged from California during this period. =Indie rock= The early 1990s saw the emergence of Pavement, an influential indie rock band from Stockton. In the mid-1990s, Beck came out of the Silver Lake (a neighborhood in Los Angeles) indie rock scene. Queercore bands Tribe 8, Pansy Division, Cypher in the Snow, the Little Deaths, and Sta-Prest formed in San Francisco in the 1990s and recorded for local label Outpunk among others. San Francisco also produced the Trashwomen and Fabulous Disaster. Los Angeles and southern California also produced Longstocking, Best Revenge, Red Aunts, Quetzal, the Muffs, and Emily's Sassy Lime in the 1990s.

Before this time, transpeninsular traffic in La Florida between the western mission settlements and the capital depended on water routes from Apalachee to St. Augustine. Agricultural commodities produced in Apalachee were carried by canoes to the Gulf of Mexico and southward on the coast to the mouth of the Suwanee River, then upriver to a location on the Santa Fe River. There they were loaded onto pack animals or the backs of Indian burderners (porters) for the remainder of the overland trip. Provisions and funds from the real situado were sent on the same route in reverse. In 1673, the Franciscan Friar Juan Moreno suggested to the Queen Regent Mariana of Spain that the situado, or annual subsidy transferred from the royal treasury of New Spain, should be transported overland from Vera Cruz in Mexico to Apalachee, and from there to St. Augustine. His suggestion was disregarded, since the route he proposed went through the territories of unchristianized Indians who were not always on friendly terms with the Spanish, while the situado, in the form of silver coins, would have to be carried by burderners across the swamps, forests, and sizable bays and rivers of the Gulf of Mexico coast, which barred the passage of wagons or royal mule trains. According to \\"El Camino Real\\", published by the Florida Division of Historical Resources: \\"In the 1680s, Florida Governor Diego de Quiroga y Losada contracted the services of military engineer Enrique Primo de Rivera to build a formal road across north Florida that was suitable for oxcarts. Although the project was never finished, people and goods continued to flow to and from the capital at St. Augustine, along the main corridor known as the Camino Real.\\" It could be said that the Spanish had an incomplete \\"trail\\" that very loosely connected the province of La Florida in the east to the Spanish settlements in Alta California in the west, through what historians call the Spanish borderlands, but it is a gross exaggeration to describe such a discontinuous pathway, the part on the Gulf of Mexico being merely Indian foot trails running along ridges, interrupted by large bodies of water and unbridged rivers with no ferries, as a \\"highway\\". The Spanish never built an actual road south of St. Augustine. Some unreliable sources claim that they built a road to New Smyrna in 1632, but the place did not exist in 1632. The area at the time was a wilderness uninhabited by Europeans, while the colony of New Smyrna begun and named by the Scottish Dr. Andrew Turnbull was not founded until 1768. The British built the King's Road from Colerain, Georgia to New Smyrna, and the Spanish did use it when they reacquired Florida in 1783, but afterward they were rather lax in maintaining it.

He was also a leading Likud member of the Israeli Knesset and a minister in its cabinet. He was the second Mizrahi Jew to be elected to presidency (after Yitzhak Navon). The end of his presidency was marked by controversy, stemming from allegations of rape of one female subordinate and sexual harassment of others. Katsav resigned the presidency in 2007 as part of a plea bargain. Katsav later rejected the deal with prosecutors and vowed he would prove his innocence in court. In an unprecedented case, on 30 December 2010, Katsav was convicted of two counts of rape, obstruction of justice and other charges. On 22 March 2011, in a landmark ruling, Katsav was sentenced to seven years in prison. Katsav appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Israel. On 10 November 2011, the Supreme Court affirmed Katsav's conviction and punishment. On 7 December 2011, Katsav arrived at Maasiyahu Prison in Ramla to begin serving his seven- year sentence. He was released from prison, under restrictive conditions, on 21 December 2016, having served five years of his sentence. Early life Musa Qassab () was born in Yazd, Iran, to Persian Jewish parents- Shmuel and Gohar Qassab. His family moved to Tehran when he was a baby, and they emigrated to Israel in 1951. They lived in a tent camp for recent immigrants for several years before the area was developed into the city of Kiryat Malakhi. Katsav graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and history in 1971. He married Gila Katsav in 1969. They have five children and two grandchildren. Political career Moshe Katsav with Colin Powell, 2003 Katsav joined the Likud Party, and was elected mayor of his home town of Kiryat Mal'akhi in 1969. He was elected to the Knesset in 1977. =Cabinet minister= Katsav was deputy Minister of Construction and Housing from 1981 to 1983 and Minister of Labor and Welfare from 1984 to 1988. He was Transportation Minister from 1988 to 1992 and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism from 1996 to 1999.Knesset ‚Äì Moshe Katsav, Roles in the Government The public positions filled by Katsav include the following: Chairman of the Iranian Immigrants Organization; Chairman of the commission to determine higher education tuition; and Member of Ben-Gurion University Board of Trustees. =Presidency= After serving as Deputy Prime Minister in Netanyahu's government, Katsav vied for the position of President, running as the opposition candidate against Shimon Peres. In a surprising upset, he defeated Peres to become the president of Israel, being elected by the Knesset on 31 July 2000. He took 63 votes (over 57 for Peres), two more than the required majority of 61, and was sworn in on 1 August. He was the first President of Israel to have been sworn in for a seven-year term, as well as the first Likud member to win the office. Katsav's victory was attributed in part to evidence that Peres planned to use the position to support the increasingly unpopular peace processes of the government of Ehud Barak. The office of the Israeli President is largely ceremonial, with no executive powers save pardoning prisoners and commuting sentences. Nevertheless, each president emphasizes different aspects of the role during his tenure. In 2003, on a visit to Italy, he demanded that the Vatican restore treasures allegedly brought to Rome after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD. On 8 April 2005, the alphabetic ordering of leaders during the funeral of Pope John Paul II resulted in Katsav sitting near Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who, like Katsav, was born in the Iranian province of Yazd. Katsav told the press that he shook Khatami's hand and spoke to him in Persian. Khatami later denied this. Rape and sexual harassment case In July 2006, Katsav complained to the Attorney General of Israel, Menachem Mazuz, that he was being blackmailed by a female employee. The investigation quickly turned against Katsav as the employee, referred to as A. (later identified as Orly Revivohttp://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.528312), alleged sexual offences. A, who worked with Katsav when he was Minister of Tourism, claimed that Katsav raped her twice and sexually harassed her in various other ways. Katsav was accused of raping and sexually harassing up to ten women. Police raided his house and seized computers and documents on 22 August.

The president is immune from prosecution while in office, and could only be tried after the end of his term in August 2007 or after his resignation. The final decision on indictment would be made after a hearing where Katsav could present his case.

In March 2009, Katsav's brother Lior said the decision to indict Katsav was tantamount to a \\"blood libel\\". =Plea bargaining and indictment= On 28 June 2007, Katsav's lawyers reached a plea bargain in which Katsav would plead guilty to several counts of sexual harassment and indecent acts and receive a suspended jail sentence. He would pay compensation to two of the victims. The rape charges brought by A. would be dropped, as well as Katsav's charges of blackmail. This led to a public outcry, in particular from women's rights organizations. Opinion polls showed that 70 percent of the public objected to the deal.Women's Coalition: Our intifada has begun Ynet, 30 June 2007 A protest at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv drew a large crowd. The Attorney- General claimed the agreement would spare humiliation of the presidency. Katsav's attorneys said they accepted to avoid an arduous trial.President Katsav of Israel to plead guilty to sex crimes but avoid jail International Herald Tribune, 28 June 2007 On 30 October 2007, the state prosecution told the High Court of Justice that it had changed its mind about the indictment on the basis of evidence from the two key complainants. The prosecution cited a meeting with Katsav's attorneys that highlighted contradictions in their testimony, including an affectionate letter from one of the complainants after the two rapes allegedly occurred. The move garnered harsh criticism from the complainants' attorneys. Katsav called off the plea bargain in April 2008. According to one of his lawyers, Avigdor Feldman, he believed the prosecution did not have enough evidence to convict him. = Trial = In March 2009, Katsav was formally indicted for rape and other sexual offenses in the Tel Aviv District Court. His trial took place between August 2009 and June 2010 before a panel of three judges, consisting of Presiding Judge George Karra and Justices Miriam Sokolov and Judith Shevach.Former Israeli president goes on trial on rape charges irishtimes.com, 1 September 2009 Katsav's testimony began in January 2010.Unjustified blackout Haaretz, 12 January 2010 The prosecutors were Ronit Amiel and Nissim Merom, of the State Prosecutor's Office Central District Office.https://www.haaretz.com/1.5101014 Katsav's defense team consisted of attorneys Zion Amir, Avigdor Feldman, and Avraham Lavi. The trial was held behind closed doors (as is customary in trials of sexual offenses) and a media ban was imposed on the details of the trial, witnesses and testimony. The ban was lifted in August 2010, when protocols of the trial were released. In the absence of forensic evidence, prosecutors built their case almost entirely on witness testimony. According to legal experts, the similarities in the testimonies of the victims, who could not have known one another, would be instrumental in his conviction. = Conviction = On 30 December 2010, the three judges unanimously found Katsav guilty of \\"rape, sexual harassment, committing an indecent act while using force, harassing a witness and obstruction of justice\\". Presiding Judge Karra read the verdict which stated that Katsav \\"engaged in a campaign of vilification against the plaintiffs.\\" Katsav faced a maximum sentence of 49 years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was \\"a sad day for Israel\\", but that the verdict shows that in Israel \\"all are equal before the law, and that every woman has exclusive rights to her body.\\" The conviction was described as \\"landmark\\" and \\"unprecedented\\", and the story featured prominently in the international media. The sentencing phase began on 22 February 2011. On 22 March 2011, Moshe Katsav was sentenced to seven years in prison and two years' probation for rape, indecent acts, sexual harassment and obstruction of justice, becoming the first former President of Israel to be sentenced to prison. In addition, he was ordered to pay one of the women compensation totaling 100,000 NIS and another a sum of 25,000 NIS.Ynet News: Moshe Katsav sentenced to 7 years in prison ynetnews.com, 22 March 2011 Katsav's lawyer Zion Amir told reporters that the sentence would be appealed to the Supreme Court of Israel. In July 2011, it was cleared for publication that Katsav was under police investigation on suspicion of using private investigators to harass witnesses and a complainant. Police suspected that the investigators were trying to obtain new evidence to undermine their credibility. It was thought that Katsav hired the investigators after he was found guilty and before the Supreme Court appeal was filed. Katsav, his brothers Lior and Yoram, and his son Noam were questioned for an hour by National Fraud Investigations Unit officers on suspicion of witness harassment, tampering and invasion of privacy. In May 2011, Supreme Court Justice Yoram Danziger granted Katsav's motion to delay his entrance to prison until the Supreme Court heard his appeal. Deliberations on the appeal began on 7 August 2011, and were conducted by a three-judge panel consisting of Justices Edna Arbel, Miriam Naor, and Salim Joubran. Katsav's attorney suggested that his client actually was sexually involved with one of the alleged victims, but that no rape occurred. He also suggested that the plaintiffs' testimonies were filled with contradictions. When deliberations resumed on 10 August, Katzav's attorney suggested that his client's actions did not constitute anything beyond \\"an ordinary hug\\". Deliberations on the appeal adjourned on 11 August. The court delivered its opinion on 10 November, unanimously upholding Katsav's conviction and sentence. The three-judge panel stated that they refrained from assessing the truth of the statements made by the accusers and otherwise rejected possibly exculpatory evidence. Justice Salim Joubran stated that Katsav \\"fell from the loftiest heights to the deepest depths. Such a senior official should be a role model to his subordinates. Every woman has a right to her own body. A right to dignity. A right to freedom. No one has the liberty to take any of those from her\\". Katsav was given until 7 December to put his affairs in order. = Prison = Gila Katsav, 2001 Following the decision, Katsav's family turned to a number of politicians, asking that Katsav's home, already surrounded by stone walls put up by Shin Bet's Protective Security Department, be declared a \\"temporary prison\\", and that he be allowed to serve his sentence there. In a letter to Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, Katsav's brother Lior wrote that while in prison, his brother could be exposed to convicts whose presidential pardon requests he had rejected, and claimed that he had knowledge of state secrets that could be compromised in prison. Aharonovich rejected that request, with sources close to him stating that prisoners were only permitted to serve their sentences at home in extremely rare cases. Katsav arrived at Maasiyahu Prison in Ramla at 10:08 am on 7 December 2011 to begin serving his sentence. Before departing for prison, he addressed journalists outside his home and maintained his innocence. Dozens of police officers were deployed to the prison to maintain order, and there was a large domestic and foreign media presence. Prison authorities determined that Katsav did not pose a suicide risk, and it was decided that the cameras in his cell would only be activated when his cellmate was absent. Katsav was Israel Prison Service inmate #1418989. His cell was located in the prison's Torani cellblock, a special bloc for religious prisoners. Though considered less harsh than other blocs, inmates in the Torani bloc have no access to television or newspapers. Prisoners are woken at 4:30 am for morning prayers, pray three times a day, and spend most of the day in two seminaries studying Torah and other sacred Jewish texts. Shlomo Benizri, another former politician who was in prison for corruption, was Katsav's cellmate until his 2012 release. It was announced on 15 October 2012, that Israel's President Shimon Peres received a formal request to pardon Katsav. The request came from Katsav's wife, Gila. The prison parole board rejected a request by Moshe Katsav for a conditional early release from prison on 6 April 2016. It is allowed by Israeli law to release a prisoner after serving two thirds of a term. The parole board decided that Katsav, who always maintained he is innocent and never expressed any regret for his actions and also refused to take part in rehabilitation programs, could continue to harass the victims and still posed a risk to women. =Release= On 18 December 2016, the parole board granted Katsav early release, announcing that he had expressed regret for his actions before it, even though he had failed to do so publicly.

It is the world's largest general scientific society, with over 120,000 members, and is the publisher of the well-known scientific journal Science. History =Creation= The American Association for the Advancement of Science was created on September 20, 1848, at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was a reformation of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists. The society chose William Charles Redfield as their first president because he had proposed the most comprehensive plans for the organization. According to the first constitution which was agreed to at the September 20 meeting, the goal of the society was to promote scientific dialogue in order to allow for greater scientific collaboration. By doing so the association aimed to use resources to conduct science with increased efficiency and allow for scientific progress at a greater rate. The association also sought to increase the resources available to the scientific community through active advocacy of science. There were only 78 members when the AAAS was formed. As a member of the new scientific body, Matthew Fontaine Maury, USN was one of those who attended the first 1848 meeting. At a meeting held on Friday afternoon, September 22, 1848, Redfield presided, and Matthew Fontaine Maury gave a full scientific report on his Wind and Current Charts. Maury stated that hundreds of ship navigators were now sending abstract logs of their voyages to the United States Naval Observatory. He added, \\"Never before was such a corps of observers known.\\" But, he pointed out to his fellow scientists, his critical need was for more \\"simultaneous observations.\\" \\"The work,\\" Maury stated, \\"is not exclusively for the benefit of any nation or age.\\" The minutes of the AAAS meeting reveal that because of the universality of this \\"view on the subject, it was suggested whether the states of Christendom might not be induced to cooperate with their Navies in the undertaking; at least so far as to cause abstracts of their log-books and sea journals to be furnished to Matthew F. Maury, USN, at the Naval Observatory at Washington.\\" William Barton Rogers, professor at the University of Virginia and later founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a resolution: \\"Resolved that a Committee of five be appointed to address a memorial to the Secretary of the Navy, requesting his further aid in procuring for Matthew Maury the use of the observations of European and other foreign navigators, for the extension and perfecting of his charts of winds and currents.\\" The resolution was adopted and, in addition to Rogers, the following members of the association were appointed to the committee: Professor Joseph Henry of Washington; Professor Benjamin Peirce of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Professor James H. Coffin of Easton, Pennsylvania, and Professor Stephen Alexander of Princeton, New Jersey. This was scientific cooperation, and Maury went back to Washington with great hopes for the future. In 1850, the first female members were accepted, they were: astronomer Maria Mitchell, entomologist Margaretta Morris, and science educator Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps. =Growth and Civil War dormancy= By 1860, membership increased to over 2,000. The AAAS became dormant during the American Civil War; their August 1861 meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, was postponed indefinitely after the outbreak of the first major engagement of the war at Bull Run. The AAAS did not become a permanent casualty of the war. In 1866, Frederick Barnard presided over the first meeting of the resurrected AAAS at a meeting in New York City. Following the revival of the AAAS, the group had considerable growth. The AAAS permitted all people, regardless of scientific credentials, to join. The AAAS did, however, institute a policy of granting the title of \\"Fellow of the AAAS\\" to well-respected scientists within the organization. The years of peace brought the development and expansion of other scientific-oriented groups. The AAAS's focus on the unification of many fields of science under a single organization was in contrast to the many new science organizations founded to promote a single discipline. For example, the American Chemical Society, founded in 1876, promotes chemistry. In 1863, the US Congress established the National Academy of Sciences, another multidisciplinary sciences organization. It elects members based on recommendations from colleagues and the value of published works. =Advocacy= Alan I. Leshner, AAAS CEO from 2001 until 2015, published many op-ed articles discussing how many people integrate science and religion in their lives. He has opposed the insertion of non-scientific content, such as creationism or intelligent design, into the scientific curriculum of schools.\\"'Academic Freedom' Bill Dangerous Distraction,\\" Alan I.

The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.\\"AAAS Board Statement on Climate Change www.aaas.org December 2006 In February 2007, the AAAS used satellite images to document human rights abuses in Burma. The next year, AAAS launched the Center for Science Diplomacy to advance both science and the broader relationships among partner countries, by promoting science diplomacy and international scientific cooperation. In 2012, AAAS published op-eds,\\"Stalling science threatens every domain of modern life\\" Alan I. Leshner, Bradenton Herald 27 September 2012 held events on Capitol Hill and released analyses of the U.S. federal research-and-development budget, to warn that a budget sequestration would have severe consequences for scientific progress.\\"Federal and State Research Could Be Crippled by Looming Cuts, Says New AAAS Report\\" Earl Lane, AAAS 28 September 2012 Sciences AAAS covers various areas of sciences and engineering.

The board of directors has a variety of powers and responsibilities. It is charged with the administration of all association funds, publication of a budget, appointment of administrators, proposition of amendments, and determining the time and place of meetings of the national association. The board may also speak publicly on behalf of the association. The board must also regularly correspond with the council to discuss their actions. AAAS Fellows The AAAS council elects every year, its members who are distinguished scientifically, to the grade of fellow (FAAAS). Election to AAAS is an honor bestowed by their peers and elected fellows are presented with a certificate and rosette pin. To limit the effects and tolerance of sexual harassment in the sciences, starting 15 October 2018, a Fellow's status can be revoked \\"in cases of proven scientific misconduct, serious breaches of professional ethics, or when the Fellow in the view of the AAAS otherwise no longer merits the status of Fellow.\\" Meetings Formal meetings of the AAAS are numbered consecutively, starting with the first meeting in 1848. Meetings were not held 1861‚Äì1865 during the American Civil War, and also 1942‚Äì1943 during World War II. Since 1946, one meeting has occurred annually, now customarily in February.  Awards and fellowships  Each year, the AAAS gives out a number of honorary awards, most of which focus on science communication, journalism, and outreach ‚Äì sometimes in partnership with other organizations. The awards recognize \\"scientists, journalists, and public servants for significant contributions to science and to the public‚Äôs understanding of science.‚Äù The awards are presented each year at the association's annual meeting. The AAAS also offers a number of fellowship programs. = Currently active awards include = * Award for Science and Diplomacy * Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science * The Eppendorf & Science Prize for Neurobiology * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Children's Science News * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Magazine * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Newspapers (< 100,000 daily circulation) * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Newspapers (> 100,000 daily circulation) * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Online * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Radio * Kavli Science Journalism Awards ‚Äì Television * Leadership in Science Education Prize for High School Teachers * Mentor Award * Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement * Newcomb Cleveland Prize * Philip Hauge Abelson Prize * Public Engagement with Science Award * Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award * John McGovern Lecture * William D.

Other peer-reviewed journals published by the AAAS are Science Signaling, Science Translational Medicine, Science Immunology, Science Robotics and the interdisciplinary Science Advances. They also publish the non-peer-reviewed Science & Diplomacy. EurekAlert! In 1996, AAAS launched the EurekAlert! website, an editorially independent, non- profit news release distribution service covering all areas of science, medicine and technology. Eurekalert! provides news in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese. In 2007, EurekAlert! Chinese was launched. Working staff journalists and freelancers who meet eligibility guidelines can access the latest studies before publication and obtain embargoed information in compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation Fair Disclosure policy. By early 2018, more than 14,000 reporters from more than 90 countries have registered for free access to embargoed materials. More than 5,000 active public information officers from 2,300 universities, academic journals, government agencies, and medical centers are credentialed to provide new releases to reporters and the public through the system. In 1998, European science organizations countered Eurekalert! with a press release distribution service AlphaGalileo. Eurekalert! has fallen under criticism for lack of press release standards and for generating churnalism.

It is the third novel to feature Hercule Poirot as the lead detective. Poirot retires to a village near the home of a friend, Roger Ackroyd, to pursue a project to perfect vegetable marrows. Soon after, Ackroyd is murdered and Poirot must come out of retirement to solve the case. The novel was well-received from its first publication. In 2013, the British Crime Writers' Association voted it the best crime novel ever. It is one of Christie's best known and most controversial novels, its innovative twist ending having a significant impact on the genre. Howard Haycraft included it in his list of the most influential crime novels ever written. The short biography of Christie which is included in 21st century UK printings of her books calls it her masterpiece, although writer and critic Robert Barnard has written that he considers it a conventional Christie novel. Plot summary In King's Abbot, wealthy widow Mrs Ferrars unexpectedly commits suicide, which distresses her fianc√©, widower Roger Ackroyd. At dinner that evening in Ackroyd's home of Fernly Park, his guests include his sister-in-law Mrs Cecil Ackroyd and her daughter Flora, big-game hunter Major Blunt, Ackroyd's personal secretary Geoffrey Raymond, and Dr James Sheppard, whom Ackroyd invited earlier that day. During dinner, Flora announces her engagement to Ackroyd's stepson, Ralph Paton. After dinner, Ackroyd reveals to Sheppard in his study that Mrs Ferrars had confided in him she was being blackmailed over her murder of her husband. He then asks Sheppard to leave, wishing to read a letter from Mrs Ferrars that arrives in the post, containing her suicide note. Once home, Sheppard receives a call from Parker, Ackroyd's butler, claiming that Ackroyd is dead. Upon returning to Fernly Park, Parker denies making such a call, yet he, Sheppard, Raymond and Blunt find Ackroyd dead in his study, stabbed to death with a weapon from his collection. Hercule Poirot, living in the village, comes out of retirement at Flora's request. She does not believe Paton killed Ackroyd, despite him disappearing and police finding his footprints on the study's window. Poirot learns a few important facts on the case: all in the household, except parlourmaid Ursula Bourne, have alibis for the murder; while Raymond and Blunt heard Ackroyd talking to someone after Sheppard left, Flora was the last to see him that evening; Sheppard met a stranger on his way home, at Fernly Park's gates; Ackroyd met a representative of a dictaphone company a few days earlier; Parker recalls seeing a chair that had been in an odd position in the study when the body was found, that has since returned to its original position; the letter from Mrs Ferrars has disappeared since the murder. Poirot asks Sheppard for the exact time he met his stranger. He later finds a goose quill and a scrap of starched cambric in the summer house, and a ring with the inscription \\"From R\\" in the backyard. Raymond and Mrs Ackroyd later reveal they are in debt, but Ackroyd's death will resolve this as they stood to gain from his will. Flora admits she never saw her uncle after dinner; she was taking money from his bedroom. Her revelation throws doubts on everyone's alibis, and leaves Raymond and Blunt as the last people to hear Ackroyd alive. Blunt reveals he is secretly in love with Flora. Poirot calls a second meeting, adding Parker, the butler; Miss Russell, the housekeeper; and Ralph Paton, whom he had found. He reveals that the goose quill is a heroin holder belonging to Miss Russell's illegitimate son, the stranger whom Sheppard met on the night of the murder. He also informs all that Ursula secretly married Paton, as the ring he found was hers; it was discarded after Paton chastised her for informing his uncle of this fact, which had led to her employment's termination. Poirot then proceeds to inform all that he knows the killer's identity, confirmed by a telegram received during the meeting. He does not reveal the name; instead he issues a warning to the killer. When Poirot is alone with Sheppard, he reveals that he knows him to be Ackroyd's killer. Sheppard was Mrs Ferrars' blackmailer and murdered Ackroyd to stop him knowing this; he suspected her suicide note would mention this fact, and so he took it after the murder. He then used a dictaphone Ackroyd had, to make it appear he was still alive when he departed, before looping back to the study's window to plant Paton's footprints; Poirot had noted an inconsistency in the time he mentioned for the meeting at the gates. As he wanted to be on the scene when Ackroyd's body was found, he asked a patient earlier in the day to call him some time after the murder, so as to have an excuse for returning to Fernly Park; Poirot's telegram confirmed this. When no-one was around in the study, Sheppard removed the dictaphone, and returned the chair that concealed it from view to its original place. Poirot tells Sheppard that all this information will be reported to the police in the morning. Dr Sheppard continues writing his report on Poirot's investigation (the novel itself), admitting his guilt and wishing his account was that of Poirot's failure to solve Ackroyd's murder. The novel's epilogue serves as his suicide note.

Narrative voice and structure The book is set in the fictional village of King's Abbot, England. It is narrated by Dr James Sheppard, who becomes Poirot's assistant, in place of Captain Hastings who has married and settled in the Argentine. The novel includes an unexpected plot twist in the final chapter, where Dr Sheppard reveals he was an unreliable narrator, using literary techniques to conceal his guilt without writing anything untrue (e.g., \\"I did what little had to be done\\" at the point where he hid the dictaphone and moved the chair). Literary significance and reception The review in the Times Literary Supplement began, \\"This is a well-written detective story of which the only criticism might perhaps be that there are too many curious incidents not really connected with the crime which have to be elucidated before the true criminal can be discovered\\". The review concluded, \\"It is all very puzzling, but the great Hercule Poirot, a retired Belgian detective, solves the mystery. It may safely be asserted that very few readers will do so.\\" A long review in The New York Times Book Review, read in part: The Observer had high praise for the novel, especially the character Caroline: > No one is more adroit than Miss Christie in the manipulation of false clues > and irrelevances and red herrings; and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd makes > breathless reading from first to the unexpected last. It is unfortunate that > in two important points ‚Äì the nature of the solution and the use of the > telephone ‚Äì Miss Christie has been anticipated by another recent novel: the > truth is that this particular field is getting so well ploughed that it is > hard to find a virgin patch anywhere. But Miss Christie's story is > distinguished from most of its class by its coherence, its reasonableness, > and the fact that the characters live and move and have their being: the > gossip-loving Caroline would be an acquisition to any novel. The Scotsman found the plot to be clever and original: > When in the last dozen pages of Miss Christie's detective novel, the answer > comes to the question, \\"Who killed Roger Ackroyd?\\" the reader will feel that > he has been fairly, or unfairly, sold up. Up till then he has been kept > balancing in his mind from chapter to chapter the probabilities for or > against the eight or nine persons at whom suspicion points.... Everybody in > the story appears to have a secret of his or her own hidden up the sleeve, > the production of which is imperative in fitting into place the pieces in > the jigsaw puzzle; and in the end it turns out that the Doctor himself is > responsible for the largest bit of reticence. The tale may be recommended as > one of the cleverest and most original of its kind. Howard Haycraft, in his seminal 1941 work, Murder for Pleasure, included the novel in his \\"cornerstones\\" list of the most influential crime novels ever written. Robert Barnard, in A Talent to Deceive: An appreciation of Agatha Christie, wrote that this novel is \\"Apart‚Äîand it is an enormous 'apart'‚Äîfrom the sensational solution, this is a fairly conventional Christie.\\" He concluded that this is \\"A classic, but there are some better [novels by] Christie.\\" John Goddard produced a thorough analysis of whether Christie 'cheats' with her sensational solution and concluded that the charge of cheating fails. Laura Thompson, Christie's biographer, wrote that this is the ultimate detective novel: > The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the supreme, the ultimate detective novel. It > rests upon the most elegant of all twists, the narrator who is revealed to > be the murderer. This twist is not merely a function of plot: it puts the > whole concept of detective fiction on an armature and sculpts it into a > dazzling new shape. It was not an entirely new idea ... nor was it entirely > her own idea ... but here, she realised, was an idea worth having. And only > she could have pulled it off so completely. Only she had the requisite > control, the willingness to absent herself from the authorial scene and let > her plot shine clear. In 1944‚Äì1946, the noted American literary critic Edmund Wilson attacked the entire mystery genre in a set of three columns in The New Yorker. The second, in the 20 January 1945 issue, was titled \\"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\\", though he does no analysis of the novel. He dislikes mystery stories altogether, and chose the famous novel as the title of his piece. Pierre Bayard, literature professor and author, in Qui a tu√© Roger Ackroyd? (Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?), re-investigates Agatha Christie's Ackroyd, proposing an alternative solution in another crime novel. He argues in favour of a different murderer ‚Äì Sheppard's sister, Caroline ‚Äì and says Christie subconsciously knew who the real culprit is. In 1990, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd came in at fifth place in The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time, a ranking by the members (all crime writers) of the Crime Writers' Association in Britain. A similar ranking was made in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America, putting this novel in twelfth place. In 2013, the Crime Writers' Association voted this novel as CWA Best Ever Novel. The 600 members of CWA said it was \\"the finest example of the genre ever penned.\\" It is a cornerstone of crime fiction, which \\"contains one of the most celebrated plot twists in crime writing history.\\" The poll taken on the 60th anniversary of CWA also honoured Agatha Christie as the best crime novel author ever. In the \\"Binge!\\" article of Entertainment Weekly Issue #1343‚Äì44 (26 December 2014 ‚Äì 3 January 2015), the writers picked The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as an \\"EW and Christie favorite\\" on the list of the \\"Nine Great Christie Novels\\". The character of Caroline Sheppard was later acknowledged by Christie as a possible precursor to her famous detective Miss Marple. Development Christie revealed in her 1977 autobiography that the basic idea of the novel was given to her by her brother-in-law, James Watts of Abney Hall, who suggested a novel in which the criminal would be a Dr. Watson character, which Christie considered to be a \\"remarkably original thought\\". In March 1924 Christie also received an unsolicited letter from Lord Mountbatten. He had been impressed with her previous works and wrote, courtesy of The Sketch magazine (publishers of many of her short stories at that time) with an idea and notes for a story whose basic premise mirrored the Watts suggestion. Christie acknowledged the letter and after some thought, began to write the book but to a plot line of her invention. She also acknowledged taking inspiration from the infamous case of the unsolved death of Charles Bravo, whom she thought had been murdered by Dr. James Manby Gully In December 1969 Mountbatten wrote to Christie again after having seen a performance of The Mousetrap. He mentioned his letter of the 1920s, and Christie replied, acknowledging the part he played in the conception of the book.

Like that paper's serialisation of The Man in the Brown Suit, there were minor amendments to the text, mostly to make sense of the openings of an instalment (e.g., changing \\"He then...\\" to \\"Poirot then...\\"). The main change was that the book has twenty-seven chapters whereas the serialisation has only twenty-four. Chapter Seven of the serialisation is named The Secrets of the Study whereas in the book it is Chapter Eight and named Inspector Raglan is Confident. In the US, the novel was serialised in four parts in Flynn's Detective Weekly from 19 June (Volume 16, Number 2) to 10 July 1926 (Volume 16, Number 5). The text was heavily abridged and each instalment carried an uncredited illustration. The Collins first edition of 1926 was Christie's first work placed with that publisher. \\"The first book that Agatha wrote for Collins was the one that changed her reputation forever; no doubt she knew, as through 1925 she turned the idea over in her mind, that here she had a winner.\\" HarperCollins, the modern successor firm to W. Collins Sons & Co. Ltd., remains the UK publishers of Christie's oeuvre. By 1928, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was available in braille through the Royal National Institute for the Blind and was among the first works to be chosen for transfer to Gramophone record for their Books for the Blind library in the autumn of 1935. By 1936 it was listed as one of only eight books available in this form. =Book dedication= Christie's dedication in the book reads: > To Punkie, who likes an orthodox detective story, murder, inquest, and > suspicion falling on every one in turn! \\"Punkie\\" was the family nickname of Christie's sister and eldest sibling, Margaret (\\"Madge\\") Frary Watts (1879‚Äì1950). Despite their eleven-year age gap, the sisters remained close throughout their lives. Christie's mother first suggested to her that she should alleviate the boredom of an illness by writing a story. But soon after, when the sisters had been discussing the recently published classic detective story by Gaston Leroux, The Mystery of the Yellow Room (1908), Christie said she would like to try writing such a story. Margaret challenged her, saying that she would not be able to do it. In 1916, eight years later, Christie remembered this conversation and was inspired to write her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Margaret Watts wrote a play, The Claimant, based on the Tichborne Case, which enjoyed a short run in the West End at the Queen's Theatre from 11 September to 18 October 1924, two years before the book publication of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. =Dustjacket blurb= The dustjacket blurb read as follows: > M. Poirot, the hero of The Mysterious Affair at Stiles and other brilliant > pieces of detective deduction, comes out of his temporary retirement like a > giant refreshed, to undertake the investigation of a peculiarly brutal and > mysterious murder. Geniuses like Sherlock Holmes often find a use for > faithful mediocrities like Dr. Watson, and by a coincidence it is the local > doctor who follows Poirot round, and himself tells the story. Furthermore, > as seldom happens in these cases, he is instrumental in giving Poirot one of > the most valuable clues to the mystery. In popular culture *In the novel The Reptile Room, book 2 of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, the character Sunny Baudelaire uses, as part of her baby babble, the interjection \\"Ackroyd!\\" as a substitute for the more common \\"Roger!\\" to mean \\"message received and understood.\\" *Gilbert Adair's 2006 locked-room mystery The Act of Roger Murgatroyd was written as \\"a celebration-cum-critique-cum-parody\\" of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Adaptations =Stage play= The book formed the basis of the earliest adaptation of any work of Christie's when the play, Alibi, adapted by Michael Morton, opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London on 15 May 1928. It ran for 250 performances with Charles Laughton as Poirot. Laughton also starred in the Broadway run of the play, retitled The Fatal Alibi, which opened at the Booth Theatre on 8 February 1932. The American production was not as successful and closed after just 24 performances. Alibi is especially notable as it inspired Christie to write her first stage play, Black Coffee. Christie, with her dog Peter, attended the rehearsals of Alibi and found its \\"novelty\\" enjoyable. However, \\"she was sufficiently irritated by the changes to the original to want to write a play of her own.\\" =Film= The play was turned into the first sound film based on a Christie work. Running 75 minutes, it was released on 28 April 1931, by Twickenham Film Studios and produced by Julius S. Hagan. Austin Trevor played Poirot, a role he reprised later that year in the film adaptation of Christie's 1930 play, Black Coffee. In 2002, the story was made into a Russian film titled –ù–µ—É–¥–∞—á–∞ –ü—É–∞—Ä–æ (\\"Neudacha Puaro\\" = \\"Poirot's Failure\\"). This film version was overall quite faithful to the original story. Cast: Konstantin Raikin as Hercule Poirot Sergei Makovetsky as Dr. Sheppard Lika Nifontova as Caroline Sheppard Olga Krasko as Flora =Radio = Orson Welles adapted the novel as a one-hour radio play for the 12 November 1939 episode of The Campbell Playhouse. Welles played both Dr Sheppard and Hercule Poirot. The play was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, produced by Welles and John Houseman, and directed by Welles. Cast: Orson Welles as Hercule Poirot and Dr Sheppard Edna May Oliver as Caroline Sheppard Alan Napier as Roger Ackroyd Brenda Forbes as Mrs Ackroyd Mary Taylor as Flora George Coulouris as Inspector Hamstead Ray Collins as Mr Raymond Everett Sloane as Parker The novel was also adapted as a 1¬Ω-hour radio play for BBC Radio 4 first broadcast on 24 December 1987. John Moffatt made the first of his many performances as Poirot. The adaptation was broadcast at 7.45pm and was recorded on 2 November of the same year; it was adapted by Michael Bakewell and produced by Enyd Williams. Cast: John Moffatt as Hercule Poirot John Woodvine as Doctor Sheppard Laurence Payne as Roger Ackroyd Diana Olsson as Caroline Sheppard Eva Stuart as Miss Russell Peter Gilmore as Raymond Zelah Clarke as Flora Simon Cuff as Inspector Davis Deryck Guyler as Parker With Richard Tate, Alan Dudley, Joan Matheson, David Goodland, Peter Craze, Karen Archer and Paul Sirr =Television= The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was adapted as a 103-minute drama transmitted in the UK on ITV Sunday 2 January 2000, as a special episode in their series, Agatha Christie's Poirot. In this adaptation Japp ‚Äì not Sheppard ‚Äì is Poirot's assistant, leaving Sheppard as just another suspect. However, the device of Dr Sheppard's journal is retained as the supposed source of Poirot's voice-over narration and forms an integral part of the d√©nouement. The plot strays considerably from the book, including having Sheppard run over Parker numerous times with his car and commit suicide with his gun after a chase through a factory. Ackroyd was changed to a more elderly, stingy man, disliked by many, who owns a chemical factory. Mrs Ackroyd is also not as zany as in the book version.

It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive. Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms (L\\\\- and D-enantiomers), though only the L-isomer exists naturally. The salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates. The malate anion is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Etymology The word 'malic' is derived from Latin 'mƒÅlum', meaning 'apple'. It is also the name of the genus Malus, which includes all apples and crabapples; and the origin of other taxonomic classifications such as Maloideae, Malinae, and Maleae. This derivation is also seen as well as in the traditional German name for malic acid, '√Ñpfels√§ure' meaning 'apple acid' as well as in modern Greek, 'mƒìlicon oxy' (ŒúŒ∑ŒªŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒøŒæœç), after the original European discovery of apples in modern- day Kazakhstan 2350 years ago by Alexander the Great's expeditionary foray into Asia. Biochemistry L-Malic acid is the naturally occurring form, whereas a mixture of L\\\\- and D-malic acid is produced synthetically. File:L-√Ñpfels√§ure.svgL-Malic acid File:D-√Ñpfels√§ure.svgD-Malic acid Malate plays an important role in biochemistry. In the C4 carbon fixation process, malate is a source of CO2 in the Calvin cycle. In the citric acid cycle, (S)-malate is an intermediate, formed by the addition of an -OH group on the si face of fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate via anaplerotic reactions. Malate is also synthesized by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate in the guard cells of plant leaves. Malate, as a double anion, often accompanies potassium cations during the uptake of solutes into the guard cells in order to maintain electrical balance in the cell. The accumulation of these solutes within the guard cell decreases the solute potential, allowing water to enter the cell and promote aperture of the stomata. In food Malic acid was first isolated from apple juice by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1785.Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1785) \\"Om Frukt- och B√•r-syran\\" (On fruit and berry acid), Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Nya Handlingar (New Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Science), 6 : 17-27. From page 21: \\" ‚Ä¶ vil jag h√•danefter kalla den √Öple-syran.\\" ( ‚Ä¶ I will henceforth call it apple acid.) Antoine Lavoisier in 1787 proposed the name acide malique, which is derived from the Latin word for apple, mƒÅlum--as is its genus name Malus.de Morveau, Lavoisier, Bertholet, and de Fourcroy, M√©thode de Nomenclature Chimique (Paris, France: Cuchet, 1787), p. 108.The Origin of the Names Malic, Maleic, and Malonic Acid Jensen, William B. J. Chem. Educ. 2007, 84, 924. Abstract In German it is named √Ñpfels√§ure (or Apfels√§ure) after plural or singular of the fruit apple, but the salt(s) Malat(e). Malic acid is the main acid in many fruits, including apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, grapes, mirabelles, peaches, pears, plums, and quinceTabelle I of and is present in lower concentrations in other fruits, such as citrus. It contributes to the sourness of unripe apples. Sour apples contain high proportions of the acid. It is present in grapes and in most wines with concentrations sometimes as high as 5 g/l.\\"Methods For Analysis of Musts and Wines\\", Ough and Amerine, John Wiley and Sons, 2nd Edition, 1988, page 67 It confers a tart taste to wine; the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness. The taste of malic acid is very clear and pure in rhubarb, a plant for which it is the primary flavor. It is also a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as \\"salt and vinegar\\" flavored potato chips. In citrus, fruits produced in organic farming contain higher levels of malic acid than fruits produced in conventional agriculture. The process of malolactic fermentation converts malic acid to much milder lactic acid. Malic acid occurs naturally in all fruits and many vegetables, and is generated in fruit metabolism.Malic Acid , Bartek Ingredients (retrieved 2 February 2012) Malic acid, when added to food products, is denoted by E number E296. It is sometimes used with or in place of the less sour citric acid in sour sweets. These sweets are sometimes labeled with a warning stating that excessive consumption can cause irritation of the mouth. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU,UK Food Standards Agency: USUS Food and Drug Administration: and Australia and New ZealandAustralia New Zealand Food Standards Code (where it is listed by its INS number 296). Malic acid provides 10 kJ (2.39 kilocalories) of energy per gram during digestion. Production and main reactions Racemic malic acid is produced industrially by the double hydration of maleic anhydride. In 2000, American production capacity was 5000 tons per year. Both enantiomers may be separated by chiral resolution of the racemic mixture, and the (S)- enantiomer may be specifically obtained by fermentation of fumaric acid. Self-condensation of malic acid with fuming sulfuric acid gives the pyrone coumalic acid: :Coumalic Acid Synthesis Malic acid was important in the discovery of the Walden inversion and the Walden cycle, in which (‚àí)-malic acid first is converted into (+)-chlorosuccinic acid by action of phosphorus pentachloride. Wet silver oxide then converts the chlorine compound to (+)-malic acid, which then reacts with PCl5 to the (‚àí)-chlorosuccinic acid. The cycle is completed when silver oxide takes this compound back to (‚àí)-malic acid.

Murders is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, featuring her characters Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp, as they contend with a series of killings by a mysterious murderer known only as \\"A.B.C.\\". The book was first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 6 January 1936,The Observer, 29 December 1935 (p. 6) sold for seven shillings and sixpence (7/6)Chris Peers, Ralph Spurrier and Jamie Sturgeon. Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p. 15) while a US edition, published by Dodd, Mead and Company on 14 February of the same year, was priced $2.00. The form of the novel is unusual, combining first-person narrative and third- person narrative. This approach was previously used by Agatha Christie in The Man in the Brown Suit. In The A.B.C. Murders the third-person narrative is supposedly reconstructed by the first-person narrator of the story, Arthur Hastings. The novel was well received in the UK and the US when it was published. One reviewer said it was \\"a baffler of the first water,\\" while another remarked on Christie's ingenuity in the plot. A reviewer in 1990 said it was \\"a classic, still fresh story, beautifully worked out.\\" Plot Returning from South America, Arthur Hastings meets with his old friend, Hercule Poirot, at his new flat in London. Poirot shows him a mysterious letter he has received, signed \\"A.B.C.\\", that details a crime that is to be committed very soon, which he suspects will be a murder. Two more letters of the same nature soon arrive to his flat, each prior to a murder being carried out by A.B.C., and committed in alphabetical order: Alice Ascher, killed in her tobacco shop in Andover; Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Barnard, a flirty waitress killed on the beach at Bexhill; and Sir Carmichael Clarke, a wealthy man killed at his home in Churston. In each murder, an ABC Rail Guide is left beside the victim. The police team for the investigation, led by Chief Inspector Japp, includes Inspector Crome, who doubts Poirot's detective abilities, and Dr Thompson, who tries to profile the killer. Poirot forms a \\"Legion\\" of relatives of the deceased to uncover new information: Franklin Clarke, Carmichael's brother; Mary Drower, Ascher's niece; Donald Fraser, Betty's fianc√©; Megan Barnard, Betty's elder sister, and Thora Grey, Carmichael's young assistant. Following a meeting with the third victim's widow, Lady Clarke, one key similarity between the murders is established ‚Äì on the day of each murder, a man selling silk stockings has appeared at or near each crime scene. Despite this information, Poirot has doubts about why the letters were sent to him, rather than the police or the newspapers, and why the third letter misspelled Poirot's address, causing a delay in his receipt of it. Soon, A.B.C. sends his next letter, directing everybody to Doncaster, where it is suspected that the next murder will occur at the St. Leger Stakes race meeting that day. However, the murderer strikes at a cinema instead, and the victim's name does not match the alphabetical pattern of the other killings. The police soon get a tip-off about the man linked to the murders ‚Äì Alexander Bonaparte Cust, an epileptic traveling salesman, who suffers from memory blackouts and constant agonizing headaches as the result of a head injury during the First World War. Cust flees his apartment, but collapses upon arriving at the Andover police station, where he is taken into custody. Apart from claiming that a stocking firm hired him, he lacks any memory of committing the murders, but believes he must be guilty of them--he had been at the cinema when the last murder occurred, and found blood on his sleeve and a knife in his pocket after he had left. The police learn that the firm in question never hired Cust. Their search of his room turns up an unopened box of ABC railway guides, and the typewriter and fine paper used in A.B.C.'s letters, while the knife is discovered in the hallway outside his room where he dropped it. Poirot doubts Cust's guilt because of his memory blackouts, and especially because he had a solid alibi for the Bexhill murder. Calling a Legion meeting, Poirot exposes one of its members, Franklin Clarke, as the A.B.C. murderer. His motive was simple ‚Äì Lady Clarke is slowly dying from cancer, and upon her death, Carmichael would probably marry his assistant. Franklin feared a possible second marriage, as he wants all of his brother's wealth, so he chose to murder his brother while Lady Clarke was still alive. A chance encounter with Cust at a pub gave Franklin the idea for the murder plot ‚Äì he would disguise his crime as being part of a serial killing. Having created the letters Poirot would receive, Franklin set up Cust with his job, giving him the typewriter and other items Franklin would use to frame him for the murders. A suggestion by Hastings makes clear that the third letter was misaddressed intentionally, because Franklin wanted no chance of the police interrupting that murder. Franklin then followed Cust to the cinema, committed the last murder, and planted the knife on him as he left. Franklin laughs off Poirot's theory, but panics when he is told that his fingerprint has been found on Cust's typewriter key, and that Milly Higley, a co-worker of Betty Barnard, had seen him in her company. Franklin attempts to commit suicide with his own gun, only to find that Poirot has emptied it with the help of a pickpocket. With the case solved, Poirot pairs off Donald with Megan. Later, Cust tells Poirot that the press have made him an offer for his story; Poirot suggests that he demand a higher price for it, and that his headaches may have arisen from his spectacles. Once alone, Poirot tells Hastings that the claim of the fingerprint on the typewriter was a bluff, but is pleased that the pair \\"went hunting once more\\".

Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement on 11 January 1936 concluded with a note of admiration for the plot that, \\"If Mrs Christie ever deserts fiction for crime, she will be very dangerous: no one but Poirot will catch her.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 11 January 1936 (p. 37) Isaac Anderson in The New York Times Book Review of 16 February 1936 finished his review by writing, \\"This story is a baffler of the first water, written in Agatha Christie's best manner. It seems to us the very best thing she has done, not even excepting Roger Ackroyd.\\" In The Observer's issue of 5 January 1936, \\"Torquemada\\" (Edward Powys Mathers) wrote, \\"Ingenuity ... is a mild term for Mrs Christie's gift. In The A.B.C. Murders, rightly chosen by the [crime] club as its book of the month, she has quite altered her method of attack upon the reader, and yet the truth behind this fantastic series of killings is as fairly elusive as any previous truth which Poirot has had to capture for us. The reader adopts two quite different mental attitudes as he reads. At first, and for a great many pages, he is asking himself: \\"Is Agatha Christie going to let me down? Does she think she can give us this kind of tale as a detective story and get away with it?\\" Then the conviction comes to him that he has been wronging the authoress, and that he alone is beginning to see through her artifice. In the last chapter he finds, because brilliant circus work with a troop of red horses and one dark herring has diverted his attention from a calm consideration of motive, he has not been wronging, but merely wrong. It is noticeable, by the way, that characters break off at intervals to tell us that we have to do with \\"a homicidal murderer\\". We are ready to take this for granted until Mrs Christie (I wouldn't put it past her) gives us one who isn't.\\" E R Punshon reviewed the novel in 1936, writing that \\"Some readers are drawn to the detective novel by the sheer interest of watching and perhaps anticipating the logical development of a given theme, others take their pleasure in following the swift succession of events in an exciting story, and yet others find themselves chiefly interested in the psychological reactions caused by crime impinging upon the routine of ordinary life. Skilful and happy is that author who can weave into a unity this triple thread. In Mrs Agatha Christie's new book...the task is attempted with success.\\" He added, \\"In the second chapter, Mrs Christie shows us what seems to be the maniac himself. But the wise reader, remembering other tales of Mrs Christie's, will murmur to himself 'I trust her not; odds on she is fooling me,' and so will continue to a climax it is not 'odds on' but a dead cert he will not have guessed. To an easy and attractive style and an adequate if not very profound sense of character Mrs Christie adds an extreme and astonishing ingenuity, nor does it very greatly matter that it is quite impossible to accept the groundwork of her tale or to suppose that any stalking-horse would behave so invariably so exactly as required. As at Bexhill, a hitch would always occur. In the smooth and apparently effortless perfection with which she achieves her ends Mrs. Christie reminds one of No√´l Coward; she might, indeed, in that respect be called the No√´l Coward of the detective novel.\\" An unnamed reviewer in the Daily Mirror of 16 January 1936 said, \\"I'm thanking heaven I've got a name that begins with a letter near the end of the alphabet! That's just in case some imitative soul uses this book as a text book for some nice little series of murders.\\" They summed up, \\"It's Agatha Christie at her best.\\"Daily Mirror, 16 January 1936 (p. 24) Robert Barnard reviewed this novel favorably, calling it \\"A classic, still fresh story, beautifully worked out.\\" He noted that the plot \\"differs from the usual pattern in that we seem to be involved in a chase: the series of murders appears to be the work of a maniac. In fact the solution reasserts the classic pattern of a closed circle of suspects, with a logical, well-motivated murder plan. The English detective story cannot embrace the irrational, it seems.\\" His final judgment on this novel is that it was \\"A total success ‚Äì but thank God she didn't try taking it through to Z.\\" In the \\"Binge!\\" article of Entertainment Weekly issue #1343‚Äì44 (26 December 2014 ‚Äì 3 January 2015), the writers picked The A.B.C. Murders as an \\"EW favorite\\" on the list of the \\"Nine Great Christie Novels\\". References to other works In Chapter 1, Poirot alludes to a situation in the 1935 novel, Three Act Tragedy. In the same chapter, Poirot mentions his failed attempt at retirement to grow vegetable marrows as depicted in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. In Chapter 3, an exchange between Japp and Poirot shows that, in 1935, Christie was already thinking about Poirot's death as later narrated in Curtain: \\"I shouldn't wonder if you ended by detecting your own death,\\" said Japp, laughing heartily. \\"That's an idea, that is. Ought to be put in a book.\\" \\"It will be Hastings who will have to do that,\\" said Poirot, twinkling at me. \\"Ha ha! That would be a joke, that would,\\" laughed Japp. Still in Chapter 3, Poirot lays out the plot of what he considers a perfect crime, a crime so challenging that \\"even he\\" would find it hard to solve. This exact murder ‚Äì where someone is murdered by one of four people playing bridge in the same room with him ‚Äì is the subject of Christie's Cards on the Table, which was published later in the same year. In Chapter 19, Poirot reflects over his first case in England, where he \\"brought together two people who loved one another by the simple method of having one of them arrested for murder.\\" This is a reference to the novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and the lovers mentioned are John and Mary Cavendish. References in other works The plot of The A.B.C. Murders is mentioned by Detective Inspector John Appleby in Michael Innes‚Ä≤ novel Appleby's End (1945). Chapters 393‚Äì397 of Gosho Aoyama's manga Detective Conan feature a case with some similarities as the criminal was inspired by the plot of The A.B.C. Murders. Episodes 325-327 of its anime adaptation also featured the incident. The 1998 anime film Case Closed: The Fourteenth Target is a combination of this story, with a murderer killing based on numbers in names as a ruse to confuse detectives, while also incorporating Christie's And Then There Were None. A Bengali detective novel of Narayan Sanyal 'O Aa Ka Khuner Kanta' was based on The A.B.C. Murders. Sanyal admitted the inspiration from Christie's novel in the introduction to the book. Here the character P. K. Basu, Bar-at-law, has the role of main protagonist, similar to Poirot. Film, TV and other adaptations =Film= The first adaptation of the novel was the 1965 film The Alphabet Murders with Tony Randall as Hercule Poirot, a version far more comic than mysterious. The story of the 2012 Malayalam film Grandmaster written by director B. Unnikrishnan draws inspirations from The A.B.C. Murders. The characterisation of Chandrasekhar in the movie as played by the Indian movie veteran Mohanlal, while inspired by that of the legendary Hercule Poirot, has more to do with the popular established screen persona of Mohanlal in Malayalam. In fact, B. Unnikrishnan himself had penned a more fleshed out script themed on the ABC Murders for an investigative television series named \\"Black and White (Season 2)\\" aired around 2004 in Asianet, starring actor Siddique in the role of the investigator. =Radio= The BBC Radio adaptation Poirot ‚Äì The ABC Murders starring John Moffatt and Simon Williams. This was first broadcast in 2000. The show is periodically rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra. The May 18, 1943 episode of Suspense was an adaptation of The ABC Murders, starring Charles Laughton. =Television= ;Agatha Christie's Poirot (1992) In 1992, the novel was adapted for television as part of ITV's Agatha Christie's Poirot, and was first aired in the UK on 5 January 1992. It starred David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, Hugh Fraser as Captain Hastings, and Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector Japp, with its guest stars including Donald Sumpter as Alexander Bonaparte Cust, Donald Douglas as Franklin Clarke, Nicholas Farrell as Donald Fraser, and Pippa Guard as Megan Barnard. The adaptation, while extremely faithful to the novel's plot, had a number of minor changes: * The characters of Inspector Crome, Dr Thompson, Lily Marbury and Tom Hartigan are omitted. * Police are alerted to Cust's suspected involvement with the murders through his landlady, while the knife used in the fourth murder is found in his room. * Franklin Clarke attempts to escape when he is exposed by Poirot as the killer. ;BBC's The ABC Murders (2018) In 2018, an adaptation of the novel, written by Sarah Phelps, was filmed for the BBC. It was aired as a three-part miniseries over three consecutive days from 26 December that year. It starred John Malkovich as Hercule Poirot, and Rupert Grint as Inspector Crome with guest stars including Eamon Farren as Alexander Bonaparte Cust, Jack Farthing as Donald Fraser, Freya Mavor as Thora Grey, Kevin McNally as Inspector Japp, and Anya Chalotra as Lily Marbury. The adaptation generally followed the novel's plot, but featured considerable changes: * Captain Hastings is omitted from the plot. * Japp dies from a heart attack at the start, leaving the investigation to be solely conducted by Inspector Crome. * Poirot's background is explored prior to the outbreak of the First World War; in this adaptation, he was a priest before the war rather than a detective in the Belgian police force. * The first three murders are committed in locations that have some relevance to Poirot; he helped deliver a baby when on a refugee train that stopped in Andover, visited the caf√© where Betty Barnard would later work on a visit to Bexhill, and attended a party at the Clarke house. * More care is taken in planning the D murder; rather than just stabbing a person in a cinema, reasoning that someone with a suitable name would be nearby, the killer intends to murder a ventriloquist at a theatre, but kills another performer on the theatre bill. * A fifth murder is conducted pertaining to the letter E and Cust is present at the scene. The killer is surprised by this and takes this opportunity to implicate Cust by planting the weapon when Cust has a fit. * Cust is pursued by police shortly after murder E. He is caught after he injures himself, rather than passing out at a police station. * There is no reference to Mary Drower, Alice Asher's niece, within the plot. Thora Grey's character is changed to being manipulated into being Franklin's accomplice by establishing an alibi for him in one of the murders. * Franklin claims, prior to his execution, that he committed the crimes to give Poirot a new cause to live for, considering them friends, although Poirot has nothing but disdain for the man's methods. =Anime= A four-part episode of the anime Agatha Christie's Great Detectives: Poirot and Marple is based on the book. The A.B.C.

Set in Japan, Poirot retains his iconic appearance though is renamed Eikubo while Hastings is renamed Asakura. =Video games= In 2009, DreamCatcher Interactive released a video game version of the novel for the Nintendo DS entitled Agatha Christie: The ABC Murders. The game has players control Captain Hastings and must solve the mystery by inspecting crime scenes and questioning suspects. To appeal to players familiar with the original story, the game also offers the option to play with a different murderer, which results in different clues and testimony throughout the entire game. The game received mediocre reviews, but was commended for its faithful recreation of the source material.

In computer science, a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. This property is used to determine the usefulness of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for a problem. Typically, a greedy algorithm is used to solve a problem with optimal substructure if it can be proven by induction that this is optimal at each step. Otherwise, provided the problem exhibits overlapping subproblems as well, dynamic programming is used. If there are no appropriate greedy algorithms and the problem fails to exhibit overlapping subproblems, often a lengthy but straightforward search of the solution space is the best alternative. In the application of dynamic programming to mathematical optimization, Richard Bellman's Principle of Optimality is based on the idea that in order to solve a dynamic optimization problem from some starting period t to some ending period T, one implicitly has to solve subproblems starting from later dates s, where t Dynamic programming ","title":"Optimal substructure"},{"id":"243110","text":"Spectral methods are a class of techniques used in applied mathematics and scientific computing to numerically solve certain differential equations, potentially involving the use of the fast Fourier transform. The idea is to write the solution of the differential equation as a sum of certain \\"basis functions\\" (for example, as a Fourier series which is a sum of sinusoids) and then to choose the coefficients in the sum in order to satisfy the differential equation as well as possible. Spectral methods and finite element methods are closely related and built on the same ideas; the main difference between them is that spectral methods use basis functions that are nonzero over the whole domain, while finite element methods use basis functions that are nonzero only on small subdomains. In other words, spectral methods take on a global approach while finite element methods use a local approach. Partially for this reason, spectral methods have excellent error properties, with the so-called \\"exponential convergence\\" being the fastest possible, when the solution is smooth. However, there are no known three-dimensional single domain spectral shock capturing results (shock waves are not smooth).pp 235, Spectral Methods: evolution to complex geometries and applications to fluid dynamics, By Canuto, Hussaini, Quarteroni and Zang, Springer, 2007. In the finite element community, a method where the degree of the elements is very high or increases as the grid parameter h decreases to zero is sometimes called a spectral element method. Spectral methods can be used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs) and eigenvalue problems involving differential equations. When applying spectral methods to time-dependent PDEs, the solution is typically written as a sum of basis functions with time-dependent coefficients; substituting this in the PDE yields a system of ODEs in the coefficients which can be solved using any numerical method for ODEs. Eigenvalue problems for ODEs are similarly converted to matrix eigenvalue problems . Spectral methods were developed in a long series of papers by Steven Orszag starting in 1969 including, but not limited to, Fourier series methods for periodic geometry problems, polynomial spectral methods for finite and unbounded geometry problems, pseudospectral methods for highly nonlinear problems, and spectral iteration methods for fast solution of steady-state problems. The implementation of the spectral method is normally accomplished either with collocation or a Galerkin or a Tau approach. Spectral methods are computationally less expensive than finite element methods, but become less accurate for problems with complex geometries and discontinuous coefficients. This increase in error is a consequence of the Gibbs phenomenon. Examples of spectral methods =A concrete, linear example= Here we presume an understanding of basic multivariate calculus and Fourier series. If g(x,y) is a known, complex-valued function of two real variables, and g is periodic in x and y (that is, g(x,y)=g(x+2\\\\pi,y)=g(x,y+2\\\\pi)) then we are interested in finding a function f(x,y) so that :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2}\\\\right)f(x,y)=g(x,y)\\\\quad \\\\text{for all } x,y where the expression on the left denotes the second partial derivatives of f in x and y, respectively. This is the Poisson equation, and can be physically interpreted as some sort of heat conduction problem, or a problem in potential theory, among other possibilities. If we write f and g in Fourier series: :f=:\\\\sum a_{j,k}e^{i(jx+ky)} :g=:\\\\sum b_{j,k}e^{i(jx+ky)} and substitute into the differential equation, we obtain this equation: :\\\\sum -a_{j,k}(j^2+k^2)e^{i(jx+ky)}=\\\\sum b_{j,k}e^{i(jx+ky)} We have exchanged partial differentiation with an infinite sum, which is legitimate if we assume for instance that f has a continuous second derivative. By the uniqueness theorem for Fourier expansions, we must then equate the Fourier coefficients term by term, giving :(*) a_{j,k}=-\\\\frac{b_{j,k}}{j^2+k^2} which is an explicit formula for the Fourier coefficients aj,k. With periodic boundary conditions, the Poisson equation possesses a solution only if b0,0 = 0. Therefore, we can freely choose a0,0 which will be equal to the mean of the resolution. This corresponds to choosing the integration constant. To turn this into an algorithm, only finitely many frequencies are solved for. This introduces an error which can be shown to be proportional to h^n, where h:=1/n and n is the highest frequency treated.  Algorithm  # Compute the Fourier transform (bj,k) of g. # Compute the Fourier transform (aj,k) of f via the formula (*). # Compute f by taking an inverse Fourier transform of (aj,k). Since we're only interested in a finite window of frequencies (of size n, say) this can be done using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Therefore, globally the algorithm runs in =Nonlinear example= We wish to solve the forced, transient, nonlinear Burgers' equation using a spectral approach. Given u(x,0) on the periodic domain x\\\\in\\\\left[0,2\\\\pi\\\\right), find u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U} such that :\\\\partial_{t} u + u \\\\partial_{x} u = \\\\rho \\\\partial_{xx} u + f \\\\quad \\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\left[0,2\\\\pi\\\\right), \\\\forall t>0 where œÅ is the viscosity coefficient.

With Fourier transformed initial conditions \\\\hat{u}_{k}(0) and forcing \\\\hat{f}_{k}(t), this coupled system of ordinary differential equations may be integrated in time (using, e.g., a Runge Kutta technique) to find a solution. The nonlinear term is a convolution, and there are several transform-based techniques for evaluating it efficiently. See the references by Boyd and Canuto et al. for more details.  A relationship with the spectral element method  One can show that if g is infinitely differentiable, then the numerical algorithm using Fast Fourier Transforms will converge faster than any polynomial in the grid size h. That is, for any n>0, there is a C_n<\\\\infty such that the error is less than C_nh^n for all sufficiently small values of h. We say that the spectral method is of order n, for every n>0. Because a spectral element method is a finite element method of very high order, there is a similarity in the convergence properties. However, whereas the spectral method is based on the eigendecomposition of the particular boundary value problem, the finite element method does not use that information and works for arbitrary elliptic boundary value problems.

His work was used by his student J. G. Herder as the main support of the Sturm und Drang movement, and is associated with the Counter-Enlightenment and Romanticism.Isaiah Berlin, Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder, London and Princeton, 2000. He introduced Kant, also from K√∂nigsberg, to the works of both Hume ‚Äì waking him from his \\"dogmatic slumber\\" ‚Äì and Rousseau. Hamann was influenced by Hume, but he used his views to argue for rather than against Christianity. Goethe and Kierkegaard were among those who considered him to be the finest mind of his time. He was also a key influence on Hegel and Jacobi. Long before the linguistic turn, Hamann believed epistemology should be replaced by the philosophy of language. Early life Johann Georg Hamann (20th century drawing) Hamann was born on August 27, 1730 in K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Initially he studied theology at the University of K√∂nigsberg,W. M. Alexander, Johann Georg Hamann Philosophy and Faith, Springer, 2012 : \\"Hamann left the University in 1751 or as late as 1752 without taking a degree.\\" but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to reading philosophy. His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade.Christoph Meineke: ‚ÄûDie Vortheile unserer Vereinigung‚Äú: Hamanns Dangeuil-Beylage im Lichte der Debatte um den handeltreibenden Adel. [In German] In: Beetz, Manfred / Rudolph, Andre (Ed.). Johann Georg Hamann: Religion und Gesellschaft (2012), pp. 46‚Äì64. He wrote under the nom de plume of ‚Äúthe Magus of the North‚Äù (). Hamann was a believer in the Enlightenment until a mystical experience in London in 1758. His translation of David Hume into German is considered by most scholars as the one that Hamann's friend, Immanuel Kant, also from K√∂nigsberg, had read and referred to as inspiration for awakening from \\"dogmatic slumber\\". Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a physics textbook for children. Hamann also introduced Kant to the work of Rousseau. = Music = Hamann was a lutenist, having studied this instrument with Timofey Belogradsky (a student of Sylvius Leopold Weiss), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in K√∂nigsberg. Philosophical views His distrust of autonomous, disembodied reason and the Enlightenment (\\"I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter\\" was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in God was the only solution to the vexing problems of philosophy. One of Kant's biographers compared him with Hamann: In Hamann's own terms Kant was a \\"Platonist\\" about reason, believing it disembodied, and Hamann an \\"Aristotelian\\" who believed it was embodied. Hamann was greatly influenced by Hume. This is most evident in Hamann's conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses. = Works = Hamann's writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. For example, his work Golgatha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness (1784) was directed against Moses Mendelssohn's Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism (1782). His work was also significantly reactive; rather than advance a ‚Äúposition‚Äù of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others' work. Hamann famously used the image of Socrates, who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his Socratic Memorabilia, an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment's dependence on reason. In Aesthetica in nuce, Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature. Editions Fragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of Sibyllinische Bl√§tter des Magus aus Norden (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821‚Äì25, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften, edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857‚Äì68, and a new edition of his Schriften und Briefen, edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74. =God= Hamann argued that the communicatio idiomatum, namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: \\"This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.\\" Hamann believed all of creation were signs from God for us to interpret. =Reason is language= His most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as Wittgenstein's. He famously said that \\"Reason is language\\" (\\"Vernunft ist Sprache\\").Johann Georg Hamann, Brief an Herder, v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, Briefwechsel, 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955‚Äì75, vol. 5, p. 177. Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's noumenal and phenomenal realms was language, with its noumenal meaning and phenomenal letters. Legacy Hamann was one of the precipitating forces for the Counter- Enlightenment. He was, moreover, a mentor to Herder and an admired influence on Goethe, Jacobi, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Lessing, and Mendelssohn. Roman Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles (Volume III in the English language translation of The Glory of the Lord series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians Oswald Bayer (Lutheran), John Milbank (Anglican), and David Bentley Hart (Orthodox). Finally, in Charles Taylor's important summative work, The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity (Taylor, 2016),Taylor, Charles (2016) The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. Hamann is given credit, along with Wilhelm von Humboldt and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \\"HHH\\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language. However, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas Isaiah Berlin, and describes Hamann as a \\"radical Enlightener\\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith. Bayer views him as less the proto-Romantic that Herder presented, and more a premodern- postmodern thinker who brought the consequences of Lutheran theology to bear upon the burgeoning Enlightenment and especially in reaction to Kant.Bayer, Oswald.

The law states that the total enthalpy change during the complete course of a chemical reaction is the same whether the reaction is made in one step or in several steps. Hess' law is now understood as an expression of the principle of conservation of energy, also expressed in the first law of thermodynamics, and the fact that the enthalpy of a chemical process is independent of the path taken from the initial to the final state (i.e. enthalpy is a state function). Reaction enthalpy changes can be determined by calorimetry for many reactions. The values are usually stated for processes with the same initial and final temperatures and pressures, although the conditions can vary during the reaction. Hess' law can be used to determine the overall energy required for a chemical reaction, when it can be divided into synthetic steps that are individually easier to characterize. This affords the compilation of standard enthalpies of formation, that may be used as a basis to design complex syntheses. Theory The Hess' law states that the change of enthalpy in a chemical reaction (i.e. the heat of reaction at constant pressure) is independent of the pathway between the initial and final states. In other words, if a chemical change takes place by several different routes, the overall enthalpy change is the same, regardless of the route by which the chemical change occurs (provided the initial and final condition are the same). Hess' law allows the enthalpy change (ŒîH) for a reaction to be calculated even when it cannot be measured directly. This is accomplished by performing basic algebraic operations based on the chemical equations of reactions using previously determined values for the enthalpies of formation. Addition of chemical equations leads to a net or overall equation. If enthalpy change is known for each equation, the result will be the enthalpy change for the net equation. If the net enthalpy change is negative (ŒîHnet < 0), the reaction is exothermic and is more likely to be spontaneous; positive ŒîH values correspond to endothermic reactions. Entropy also plays an important role in determining spontaneity, as some reactions with a positive enthalpy change are nevertheless spontaneous. Hess' law states that enthalpy changes are additive. Thus the ŒîH for a single reaction : \\\\Delta H_{reaction}^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum \\\\Delta H_{\\\\mathrm f \\\\,(products)}^{\\\\ominus} - \\\\sum \\\\Delta H_{\\\\mathrm f \\\\,(reactants)}^{\\\\ominus} where \\\\Delta H_f is an enthalpy of formation, and the ~~o~~ superscript indicates standard state values. This may be considered as the sum of two (real or fictitious) reactions: :Reactants ‚Üí Elements :\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus = - \\\\sum \\\\Delta H_{\\\\mathrm f \\\\,(reactants)}^{\\\\ominus} and Elements ‚Üí Products :\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum \\\\Delta H_{\\\\mathrm f \\\\,(products)}^{\\\\ominus} Examples 1) Given: *B2O3 (s) + 3H2O (g) ‚Üí 3O2 (g) + B2H6 (g) (ŒîH = 2035 kJ/mol) *H2O (l) ‚Üí H2O (g) (ŒîH = 44 kJ/mol) *H2 (g) + (1/2)O2 (g) ‚Üí H2O (l) (ŒîH = -286 kJ/mol) *2B (s) + 3H2 (g) ‚Üí B2H6 (g) (ŒîH = 36 kJ/mol) Find the ŒîHf of: *2B (s) + (3/2) O2 (g) ‚Üí B2O3 (s) After the multiplication and reversing of the equations (and their enthalpy changes), the result is: *B2H6 (g) + 3O2 (g) ‚Üí B2O3 (s) + 3H2O (g) (ŒîH = -2035 kJ/mol) *3H2O (g) ‚Üí 3H2O (l) (ŒîH = -132 kJ/mol) *3H2O (l) ‚Üí 3H2 (g) + (3/2) O2 (g) (ŒîH = 858 kJ/mol) *2B (s) + 3H2 (g) ‚Üí B2H6 (g) (ŒîH = 36 kJ/mol) Adding these equations and canceling out the common terms on both sides, we get *2B (s) + (3/2) O2 (g) ‚Üí B2O3 (s) (ŒîH = -1273 kJ/mol) 2) a) Cgraphite+O2 ‚Üí CO2 (g) ;(ŒîH = -393.5 kJ/mol) (direct step) :b) Cgraphite+1/2 O2 ‚Üí CO (g) ; (ŒîH = -110.5 kJ/mol) :c) CO (g)+1/2 O2 ‚Üí CO2 (g); (ŒîH = - 283.02 kJ/mol) ‚ÜíIn the reactions b) and c), the total ŒîH = -393.5 kJ/mol which is equal to ŒîH in a) The difference in the value of ŒîH is 0.02 kJ/mol which is due to measurement errors . Extension to free energy and entropy The concepts of Hess' law can be expanded to include changes in entropy and in Gibbs free energy, which are also state functions. The Bordwell thermodynamic cycle is an example of such an extension which takes advantage of easily measured equilibria and redox potentials to determine experimentally inaccessible Gibbs free energy values. Combining ŒîG ~~o~~ values from Bordwell thermodynamic cycles and ŒîH ~~o~~ values found with Hess' law can be helpful in determining entropy values which are not measured directly, and therefore must be calculated through alternative paths. For the free energy: :\\\\Delta G_{reaction}^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum \\\\Delta G_{\\\\mathrm f \\\\,(products)}^{\\\\ominus} - \\\\sum \\\\Delta G_{\\\\mathrm f \\\\,(reactants)}^{\\\\ominus}. For entropy, the situation is a little different. Because entropy can be measured as an absolute value, not relative to those of the elements in their reference states (as with ŒîH ~~o~~ and ŒîG ~~o~~ ), there is no need to use the entropy of formation; one simply uses the absolute entropies for products and reactants: :\\\\Delta S_{reaction}^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum S_{(products)}^{\\\\ominus} - \\\\sum S_{(reactants)}^{\\\\ominus}. Applications Hess' Law of Constant Heat Summation is useful in the determination of enthalpies of the following: #Heats of formation of unstable intermediates like CO(g) and NO(g). #Heat changes in phase transitions and allotropic transitions. #Lattice energies of ionic substances by constructing Born-Haber cycles if the electron affinity to form the anion is known, or #Electron affinities using a Born-Haber cycle with a theoretical lattice energy See also *Thermochemistry *Thermodynamics References * Further reading * External links *Hess' paper (1840) on which his law is based (at ChemTeam site) *a Hess‚Äô Law experiment Chemical thermodynamics Physical chemistry Thermochemistry ","title":"Hess's law"},{"id":"243145","text":"Daughter of Destiny (1917) starring Olga Petrova Smoke week (1917), letter by Rothafel Samuel Lionel \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel (July 9, 1882 ‚Äì January 13, 1936) was an American theatrical impresario and entrepreneur. He is noted for developing the lavish presentation of silent films in the deluxe movie palace theaters of the 1910s and 1920s. Life and career Rothafel (originally Rothapfel, meaning ‚Äò‚ÄòRed Apple‚Äô‚Äô, the modern German spelling is: Rotapfel)Ken Bloom, Broadway: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2013, p. 460. was born in Bromberg, Germany, the son of Cecelia (n√©e Schwerzens) and Gustav Rothapfel. In 1886, at the age of three, with his mother, he boarded the S/S Rugia, sailing from Hamburg, and then arriving at the Port of New York, May 24, 1886.Samuel Rothapfel, New York Passenger and Crew Lists, S/S Rugia, 24 May 1886 before moving to Stillwater, Minnesota. Best known by his nickname, \\"Roxy\\", he was the impresario who brought the great New York City movie palaces that he managed to fame and popular success. He began his show business career in Forest City, Pennsylvania, where he created the \\"Family Theater\\", a combination cinema and skating rink. In 1912 he came to New York City, where he would achieve his greatest successes. In New York at different times he managed and produced shows at the Regent, Strand, Rialto, Rivoli, and Capitol theaters. His greatest achievement was his eponymous Roxy Theatre at Times Square which opened March 11, 1927. He later opened the Radio City Music Hall and the RKO Roxy (later the Center Theatre) in 1932, his last theatrical project. The Music Hall featured the precision dance troupe the Roxyettes (later renamed The Rockettes), which Rothafel brought with him from the Roxy Theatre. Rothafel has been credited with many movie presentation innovations, including synchronizing orchestral music to movies (in the silent film era) and having multiple projectors to effect seamless reel changes. The book The Best Remaining Seats by Ben M. Hall (1961), gives a good overview of the movie palaces of the 1920s and, specifically, of Roxy himself. Rothafel had health issues in his later life, mainly angina pectoris. He died of a heart attack in his sleep on January 13, 1936 in New York City aged 53. He is buried in Linden Hill Jewish cemetery in Queens, New York. His wife was Rosa (Freedman). His son was Arthur Ingram Rothafel, journalist, writer and ski reporter. His daughter, Beta Rothafel, married Lawrence Harold Levy, the son of Samuel Levy, a New York City lawyer, businessman, and public official, who served as Manhattan Borough President. Through Rothafel's granddaughter, Penny (Levy), he is the great-grandfather of actress Amanda Peet. =Radio= Roxy also made a name for himself on network radio, where he began broadcasting in mid- November 1922. Through 1925, live broadcasts of his weekly variety show Roxy and His Gang from the Capitol Theatre in New York became increasingly popular. One estimate from 1924 placed his typical radio audience at about five million listeners, and he was said to receive thousands of pieces of fan mail weekly.Melnick, 221 After Rothafel left the Capitol, his radio show, now known as The Roxy Hour, was broadcast from the new Roxy Theatre on the NBC Blue network from 1927 to 1932.Bloom, 462http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2015/04/14/american-idols-roxy-major-bowes- and-early-radio-stardom/ References Further reading * Ken Bloom.

The film stars Malcolm McDowell in the title role, alongside Teresa Ann Savoy, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, John Steiner and John Gielgud. It is the only feature film produced by the men's magazine Penthouse. Producer Bob Guccione, the magazine's founder, intended to produce an explicit pornographic film with a feature film narrative and high production values. He cast Penthouse Pets as extras in unsimulated sex scenes filmed during post-production by himself and Giancarlo Lui. Gore Vidal originated the idea for a film about the controversial Roman emperor and produced a draft screenplay under the working title Gore Vidal's Caligula. The director Tinto Brass extensively altered Vidal's original screenplay, however, leading Vidal to disavow the film. The final screenplay focuses on the idea that \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\". However, both Brass and Vidal disagreed with Guccione's use of unsimulated sexual content, which Brass refused to film.What Culture#14: Caligula Because the producers did not allow Brass to edit the film, they changed its tone and style significantly and added hardcore sex scenes not filmed by Brass, thus turning Caligula into a pornographic drama that disregarded the director's intentions to present the film as a political satire. As a result, Brass also disavowed the film. Caligulas release was met with legal issues and controversies over its violent and sexual content. Its uncut form remains banned in several countries. Although contemporary reviews were overwhelmingly negative, Caligula is now considered to be a cult classic in retrospect, and its political content is considered to have significant merit. The script was later adapted into a novelization written by William Johnston under the pseudonym William Howard. In 2018, Penthouse announced that a new Director's Cut of the film was being edited by Alexander Tuschinski, with the approval of Brass's family. No release date for that cut has been confirmed. In 2020, another version of the film was announced to be released in the fall of that year, edited by E. Elias Merhige to follow more closely Gore Vidal's original screenplay instead of Tinto Brass' or Bob Guccione's vision. Plot Caligula is the young heir to the throne of his great uncle, the Emperor Tiberius. One morning, a blackbird flies into his room; Caligula considers this a bad omen. Shortly afterward, the head of the Praetorian Guard, Macro, tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at Capri, where the Emperor lives with his close friend Nerva, a dim-witted relative Claudius, and Caligula's adopted son (Tiberius‚Äôs grandson) Gemellus. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave but his sister and lover Drusilla persuades him to go. At Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced venereal diseases, and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading sex shows that include deformed people and animals. Caligula observes with fascination and horror. Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus. Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve. Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness. After Tiberius' death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the Roman Senate. Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula sets up a mock trial in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro's wife Ennia banished from Rome. After Macro is executed in a gruesome public game, Caligula appoints Tiberius' former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator Chaerea as the new head of the Praetorian Guard. Drusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the cult they secretly practice. Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister. Instead, Caligula marries Caesonia, a priestess and notorious courtesan, after she bears him an heir. Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage. Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities. Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla. After discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula suffers severe fever. Drusilla nurses him back to health. Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, Julia Drusilla. During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he suffered. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird. Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever. Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula suffers a nervous breakdown and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla's body. Now in a deep depression, Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla. After a brief stay in a city jail, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe. The new reign he leads becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Romesenators' wives are forced to work in the service of the state as prostitutes, estates are confiscated, the old religion is desecrated and the army is made to embark on a mock invasion of Britain. Unable to further tolerate his actions, Longinus conspires with Chaerea to assassinate Caligula. Caligula enters his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him. Another blackbird appears but only Caesonia is frightened of it. The next morning, after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula and his family are attacked in a coup headed by Chaerea. Caesonia and Julia are murdered, and Chaerea stabs Caligula in the stomach. With his final breath, the Emperor defiantly whimpers \\"I live!\\" as Caligula and his family's bodies are thrown down the stadium's steps and their blood is washed off the marble floor. Claudius witnesses the entire ordeal and is proclaimed Emperor by the Praetorian Guard. Cast Production =Development= Gore Vidal was paid $200,000 to write the screenplay for Caligula; ultimately, the film credited no official screenwriter, only that it was \\"adapted from a screenplay\\" by Vidal. The men's magazine Penthouse had long been involved in film funding, helping invest in films made by other studios, including Chinatown, The Longest Yard and The Day of the Locust, but it had never produced a film on its own. The magazine's founder Bob Guccione wanted to produce an explicit adult film within a feature film narrative that had high production values; he decided to produce a film about the rise and fall of the Roman emperor Caligula. Development began under producer Franco Rossellini, the nephew of filmmaker Roberto Rossellini. A screenplay was written by Lina Wertm√ºller, but Guccione rejected Wertm√ºller's script and paid Gore Vidal to write a new screenplay. Vidal's screenplay had a strong focus on homosexuality, leading Guccione to demand rewrites which toned down the homosexual content for wider audience appeal. Guccione was concerned that Vidal's script contained several homosexual sex scenes and only one scene of heterosexual sex, which was between Caligula and his sister Drusilla. Vidal was paid for his screenplay, which was titled Gore Vidal's Caligula. Elaborate sets were built by production designer Danilo Donati, who also designed the film's costumes, jewelry, hair styles, wigs and makeup. Several mainstream actors were cast, Guccione intending to make a film which he felt, like Citizen Kane, would be a landmark in cinematic history. Guccione offered directing duties to John Huston and Lina Wertm√ºller, both of whom rejected the film. After viewing scenes from the film Salon Kitty, Guccione agreed to have lunch with that film's director Tinto Brass, believing Brass would be the ideal person to direct Caligula. Brass had a reputation for being difficult to deal with on film sets but Guccione thought the film's epic scope would \\"keep [Brass] in line\\" and that Brass understood the concept of the film enough to direct it. Brass described Vidal's screenplay as \\"the work of an aging arteriosclerotic\\" and agreed to direct only if he was allowed to rewrite Vidal's screenplay. Brass's screenplay expanded the sexual content to include orgies, decorative phalluses, and much female nudity. Guccione said Brass's rewrites were done out of necessity to the film's visual narrative and did not alter the dialogue or content. In an interview for Time magazine, Vidal said that in film production, directors were \\"parasites\\" and a film's author was its screenwriter; in response, Brass demanded Vidal's removal from the set and Guccione agreed. Guccione considered film to be a \\"collective effort, involving the input of a great number of artists and craftsmen\\", and the director to be the leader of a \\"team effort\\". Vidal filed a contractual dispute over the film because of Brass's rewrites; Guccione said Vidal had demanded 10% of the film's profits, which Vidal said was not the case. Vidal distanced himself from the production, calling Brass a \\"megalomaniac\\". Brass publicly stated, \\"If I ever really get mad at Gore Vidal, I'll publish his script\\". Vidal's name was removed from the film's title; the credits were changed to state that the film was \\"adapted from a screenplay by Gore Vidal\\", crediting no official screenwriter. Guccione said, \\"Gore's work was basically done and Tinto's work was about to begin\\". Themes and significance The film's primary theme is \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\". Vidal's script presented Caligula as a good man driven to madness by absolute power; Brass's screenplay envisioned Caligula as a \\"born monster\\". In The Encyclopedia of Epic Films, author Djoymi Baker describes Brass's screenplay as \\"an antiepic with an antihero, on a path of self-inflicted, antisocial descent\\". Guccione said this final draft was more violent than sexual, stating, \\"I maintain the film is actually anti-erotic ... in every one of its scenes you'll find a mixture of gore or violence or some other rather ugly things\\". =Casting= Renowned actors were cast in the film, including Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and Sir John Gielgud, with Maria Schneider cast as Caligula's doomed sister Drusilla. Schneider became uncomfortable with appearing nude and in sexual scenes, and left the production, to be replaced by Teresa Ann Savoy, whom Brass had previously worked with on Salon Kitty. Schneider had also apparently angered Brass by sewing up the open tunics she was supposed to wear on camera.\\"Stracult Movie - Therese Ann Savoy\\", Video Rai TV (July 31, 2012) Gielgud was originally offered the role of Tiberius, which he declined, as he felt Vidal's script was \\"pornographic\\"; however, he later accepted the role of Nerva. Director Tinto Brass cast his own acquaintances as senators and noblemen, including ex-convicts, thieves and anarchists. Guccione cast Penthouse Pets as female extras in sexual scenes. = Filming = Malcolm McDowell was cast as Caligula, a \\"born monster\\" who serves as the film's antihero. Principal photography began in 1976 in Rome. McDowell got along well with Tinto Brass, while Peter O'Toole immediately disliked the director. John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were indifferent to Brass; they ultimately trusted his direction and focused on their own performances. O'Toole had stopped drinking alcohol before filming, but Guccione described O'Toole as being \\"strung out on something\\" and said the actor was not sober during the entire filming schedule. During the film's production, McDowell took members of the production to dinner at an expensive restaurant to celebrate England's win in a football match against the Italian team. He left the choreographer to pay for the meal, saying he had forgotten to bring enough money. At the end of the production, McDowell gave his dresser a pendant bearing her name, but it was misspelled and she gave it back to him. McDowell offered her a signet ring, a prop from the film. She refused because it belonged to the production company. Brass decided not to focus much on Danilo Donati's elaborate sets, and intentionally kept the Penthouse Pets in the background during sex scenes. He focused instead on women whom Guccione considered to be unattractive. Brass and Guccione disagreed about the film's approach to sexual content; Guccione preferred unsimulated sexual content that Brass did not want to film. =Post- production= Tinto Brass served as the film's director, but disowned the film in post-production, and was credited only for \\"principal photography\\". Filming concluded on 24 December 1976. Guccione said Brass shot enough film to \\"make the original version of Ben-Hur about 50 times over\\". Brass started editing the film himself but was not allowed to continue after he had edited approximately the first hour of it. His rough-cut was disassembled afterwards and the film was edited by several editors, changing its tone and structure significantly by removing and re-arranging many scenes, using different takes, a slower editing style and music other than Brass intended. A few weeks after filming had concluded, Guccione and Giancarlo Lui returned to Rome with several Penthouse Pets. Guccione and Lui \\"hired a skeleton crew, snuck back into the studios at night, raided the prop room\\" and shot hardcore sex scenes to edit into the film. Brass ultimately disowned the film. Even though there were a number of editors on the film, their names were not credited. Instead, the credit \\"Editing by the Production\\" is given during the opening credits. The film was intended for release in English, but with many of the supporting actors/actresses only speaking Italian, their lines needed to be dubbed. Peter O'Toole was reluctant to re-record his English dialogue when it was needed. He stayed away from the film's producers until he finally agreed to re-record his dialogue in a Canadian recording studio. Soundtrack The film was scored by Bruno Nicolai under the name Paul Clemente. According to Kristopher Spencer, the score \\"is gloriously dramatic, capturing both the decadent atmosphere of ancient Rome and the twisted tragedy of its true story\\". The score also featured music by Aram Khachaturian (from Spartacus) and Sergei Prokofiev (from Romeo and Juliet). In November 1980, Guccione formed Penthouse Records to release a double album soundtrack to Caligula. The album featured Nicolai's score and two versions‚Äîone in a disco style‚Äîof a love theme titled \\"We Are One\\", which did not appear in the film. =Track listing= { width=70%  } Release Helen Mirren was cast as Caesonia, wife of Caligula. Mirren described the film as an \\"irresistible mix of art and genitals\\". A 3 ¬Ω hour cut of the film was shown at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival. An edited version had a limited run in a small town near Forli, Italy before opening in Rome on Sunday, November 11, 1979. In Rome, it was the highest-grossing film of the weekend, with a gross of $59,950 from 6 theaters. The film was confiscated by Italian police on November 15 with the district attorney calling many scenes in the film \\"flagrantly obscene\\". In the United States, Guccione refused to submit Caligula to the MPAA because he did not want the film to receive a ratingeven Xwhich he considered to be \\"demeaning\\". Instead, Guccione applied his own \\"Mature Audiences\\" rating to the film, instructing theater owners not to admit anyone under the age of 18. The film premiered in the United States on 1 February 1980, at the Trans Lux East Theatre, which Guccione had rented exclusively to screen the film; he changed the theater's name to Penthouse East. Rather than leasing prints to exhibitors, the distributor rented theaters that specialized in foreign and art films for the purpose of screening Caligula exclusively in order to keep the film out of theaters that showed pornographic films. In 1981, the Brazilian Board of Censors approved the establishment of special theaters to screen In the Realm of the Senses and Caligula because they were international box office hits. Caligula grossed at the box office, becoming the highest-grossing pornographic film ever produced independently. The film was a financial success in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan. A 105-minute R-rated version without the explicit sexual material was released in 1981. The script was adapted into a novelization written by William Johnston under the pseudonym William Howard. Legal problems In 1979, when Guccione tried to import the film's footage into the U.S., customs officials seized it. Federal officials did not declare the film to be obscene. When the film was released in New York City, the anti-pornography organization Morality in Media unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit against these federal officials. In Boston, authorities seized the film. Penthouse took legal action, partly because Guccione thought the legal challenges and moral controversies would provide \\"the kind of [marketing] coverage money can never buy\\". Penthouse won the case when a Boston Municipal Court ruled that Caligula had passed the Miller test and was not obscene. While the Boston judge said the film \\"lacked artistic and scientific value\\" because of its depiction of sex and considered it to \\"[appeal] to prurient interests\\", he said the film's depiction of ancient Rome contained political values which enabled it to pass the Miller test in its depiction of corruption in ancient Rome, which dramatized the political theme that \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\". A Madison, Wisconsin, district attorney declined an anti-pornography crusader's request to prevent the release of Caligula on the basis that \\"the most offensive portions of the film are those explicitly depicting violent, and not sexual conduct, which is not in any way prohibited by the criminal law.\\" Atlanta prosecutors threatened legal action if the film was to be screened in the city, but experts testified in court on behalf of the film, and Atlanta, too, declared that the film was not obscene. Citizens for Decency through Law, a private watchdog group which protested against films which it deemed immoral, sought to prevent the film's exhibition in Fairlawn, Ohio, on the grounds that it would be a \\"public nuisance\\", leading Penthouse to withdraw the film from exhibition there to avoid another trial. CDL's lawyer advised against attempting to prosecute Penthouse for obscenity and instead recommended a civil proceeding, because the film would not be placed against the Miller test. The Penthouse attorney described the Fairlawn events as being driven by conservative morality reinforced by Ronald Reagan's presidential victory, stating, \\"Apparently, these extremists have interpreted a change by administration to mean a clarion call for a mandate to shackle the public's mind again.\\" The uncut film was granted a certificate by the British Board of Film Classification in 2008. The film was banned in Australia, where it continues to be banned in its uncut form . In 1981, Anneka Di Lorenzo, who played Messalina, sued Guccione, claiming sexual harassment. In 1990, after a protracted litigation, a New York state court awarded her $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages. On appeal, court vacated the award, ruling that punitive damages were not allowed by the law governing the case. Reception =Contemporary reviews= Peter O'Toole was cast as Tiberius in the film, a role originally offered to John Gielgud. Caligula received generally negative reviews. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, calling it \\"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\\". Ebert wrote, \\"In the two hours of this film that I saw, there were no scenes of joy, natural pleasure, or good sensual cheer. There was, instead, a nauseating excursion into base and sad fantasies.\\" It is also notable for being one of the few films Ebert ever walked out of‚Äîhe walked out 2 hours into its 170-minute length after feeling \\"disgusted and unspeakably depressed\\". He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their \\"dogs of the year\\" in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews. Hank Werba of Variety described the film as a \\"moral holocaust\\" in his review.< Rex Reed called Caligula \\"a trough of rotten swill\\". Jay Scott, reviewing Caligula for The Globe and Mail, said, \\"Caligula doesn't really work on any level\\".Jay Scott, The Globe and Mail, February 7, 1980. Scott unfavourably compared Caligula with In the Realm of the Senses, describing the latter film as a better treatment of extreme sexuality. Scott's review went on to say \\"Rome would seem to be at least as fecund a territory for the cinematic exploration of sex, death and money, as pre-war Japan ... but what's missing from Caligula, which is rife with all three, is any connective tissue (also any point of view, any thought, any meaning)\\". Scott concluded his review by claiming the whole film's production was \\"a boondoggle of landmark proportions\\". New York critic David Denby described the film as \\"an infinitely degraded version of Fellini Satyricon. Tom Milne (Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the film was \\"by no means so awesomely bad as most critics have been pleased to report‚Äîbut pretty bad all the same\\" and found the film to be \\"notable chiefly for the accuracy with which it reflects this anonymity.\\" Caligula continued to garner negative reception long after its release. It has been reappraised by some critics; review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a negative score of 23% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 3.06/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Endlessly perverse and indulgent, Caligula throws in hardcore sex every time the plot threatens to get interesting.\\" Leslie Halliwell said Caligula was \\"a vile curiosity of interest chiefly to sado-masochists\\".Photoplay Magazine, Volume 38, 1987 (p.38) Time Out London called it \\"a dreary shambles\\". Positive criticism of the film came from Moviehole reviewer Clint Morris, who awarded it 3 stars out of 5, calling it \\"[a] classic in the coolest sense of the word\\". New Times critic Gregory Weinkauf gave the film 3 out of 5, calling it \\"Kinda dumb and tacky, but at least it's a real movie\\". Arkansas Democrat- Gazette reviewer Philip Martin also gave the film 3 out of 5. Writers for The Hamilton Spectator and St. Louis Post-Dispatch said Caligula was one of the worst films they'd seen.\\"Lowest:100 Really Bad Moments in 20th Century Entertainment\\". The Hamilton Spectator, July 24, 1999 (p. W17).Joe Holleman, \\"Roman Warriors roam the big screen again\\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch May 5, 2000 (p. E1). Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps said, \\"As a one-of-a- kind marriage of the historical epic and the porn film ... Caligula deserves a look. But it might be better to let Guccione's savagely unpleasant folly fade into the century that spawned it\\".Keith Phipps (April 23, 2002) Caligula. The AV Club. Retrieved January 12, 2014. =Retrospective recognition= Caligula is considered to be a \\"cult classic\\". Helen Mirren has defended her involvement with the final product of the film and even described Caligula as \\"an irresistible mix of art and genitals\\". In 2005, artist Francesco Vezzoli produced a fake trailer for an alleged remake called Gore Vidal's Caligula as a promotion for Versace's new line of accessories; the remake was to star Helen Mirren as \\"the Empress Tiberius\\", Gerard Butler as Chaerea, Milla Jovovich as Drusilla, Courtney Love as Caligula, and Karen Black as Agrippina the Elder and featuring an introduction by Gore Vidal. The fake trailer was screened worldwide, including New York City's Whitney Museum of American Art's 2006 Whitney Biennial. Leonardo DiCaprio has cited the film as an influence on his performance as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street. Reconstruction attempts In 2007, Caligula was released on DVD and Blu-ray in an \\"Imperial Edition\\", which featured the unrated theatrical release version and a new version featuring alternative sequencing from the original theatrical release and without the explicit sexual content shot by Guccione, marking the first attempt to reconstruct the film into a version closer to Brass' intentions. This edition also includes audio commentaries featuring Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren, and interviews with the cast and crew. In February 2018, Penthouse announced that a new cut of the film was being edited by Alexander Tuschinski. Tuschinski will use 85 minutes of Brass's original workprint and edit the remainder of the film himself. Brass' family supports Tuschinski's effort, but it remains unconfirmed if Brass will be directly involved with the edit. However, the edit is an attempt to realize Brass's original vision for the film. In July 2018, Alexander Tuschinski released his documentary Mission: Caligula on Vimeo. The film explores his relationship to Caligula, the process of reconstructing Brass's vision and Penthouse CEO Kelly Holland's backing of the project. In 2020, another version of the film was announced to be released in the fall of that year, edited by E. Elias Merhige to follow more closely Gore Vidal's original screenplay instead of Tinto Brass' or Bob Guccione's vision. See also *Unsimulated sex References External links * Alexander Tuschinski.

The lowest common ancestor of two nodes d and e in a rooted tree T is the node g that is an ancestor of both d and e and that has the greatest depth in T. It is named after Robert Tarjan, who discovered the technique in 1979. Tarjan's algorithm is an offline algorithm; that is, unlike other lowest common ancestor algorithms, it requires that all pairs of nodes for which the lowest common ancestor is desired must be specified in advance. The simplest version of the algorithm uses the union-find data structure, which unlike other lowest common ancestor data structures can take more than constant time per operation when the number of pairs of nodes is similar in magnitude to the number of nodes. A later refinement by speeds the algorithm up to linear time.  Pseudocode  The pseudocode below determines the lowest common ancestor of each pair in P, given the root r of a tree in which the children of node n are in the set n.children. For this offline algorithm, the set P must be specified in advance. It uses the MakeSet, Find, and Union functions of a disjoint-set forest. MakeSet(u) removes u to a singleton set, Find(u) returns the standard representative of the set containing u, and Union(u,v) merges the set containing u with the set containing v.

In honor of their efforts, the pair were elected consuls for the remainder of that year.  Potitus and the Decemvirate  The two men were patricians who stood up when a plebeian was being abused by the despotic second decemvirate, spoke critically of the decemviri and showed sympathy towards the plebeians. When the plebeians rebelled in the second plebeian secession they were chosen as negotiators because their previous actions had put them in a favourable light in the eyes of the plebeians, who felt that they were trustworthy.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 3.49-50 When the demands of the plebeians were met and the secession was called off, both men were elected as consuls.Livy, 3.53-54 They passed the Valerio-Horatian Laws (Leges Veleriae- Horatiae). The first law established that the resolutions (plebiscites) of the Plebeian Council were binding on whole people, including the patricians. The second law restored the right of appeal to the people which had been suspended during the two decemvirates and added the provision that no official exempt from the right of appeal was to be appointed and in the case of such an appointment anyone could lawfully kill him. The third law put the principle of the inviolability (sacrosanctity) of the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) into the statutes.Livy, 3.55 Previously, this principle was only enshrined in the religious sanction of the lex sacrata. Both the story of the first and the second decemvirates have been questioned by some modern historians who think that the second decemvirate was a fiction.Beloch, Romische Geschichte bis zum Beginn der punischen Kriege, 1896, p. 326Drummond A, Cambridge Ancient History, VII.2 1989, pp. 113-142Forsythe, G., A Critical History of Early Rome, pp. 223-324 This would put into question the historicity of the second plebeian secession, the consulship of Lucius Valerius and his colleague and the Valerio-Horatian Laws. Mommsen and Cornell are among the historians who defend the historicity of at least the core of the story.Mommsen, Romische Forschungen, I (1864), pp.285-318Cornell, T.J., The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 273-275 The Valerio- Horatian Laws have also been questioned. Regarding the law on the right of appeal, there were two other such laws by consuls from the Valeria family (dated 509 BC and 300 BC) and the argument is that only the last one is historical. Regarding the law of the resolution of the Plebeian Council, there were two other laws with the same provision, the Lex Publilia of 339 BC and the Lex Hortensia of 287 BC. Again, it is argued that only the last law is historical.Pais, E. Storia crtica di Roma, II (1913), p. 465De Sanctis, G., Storia dei Romani, II (1960), pp. 49-50Staveley, E.

They were, according to Tacitus, the first elected quaestors of the Republic.Tacitus, Annals, xi. 22Broughton, vol i, pp.51 References Roman patricians Roman Republican consuls Potitus, Lucius 5th-century BC Romans ","title":"Lucius Valerius Potitus (consul 449 BC)"},{"id":"243274","text":"Marcus Valerius Maximus Corvus (c. 370 ‚Äì c. 270 BC) was an important military commander and politician from the early-to-middle period of the Roman Republic. In a distinguished career, he was elected Roman consul six times, his first at the unusual age of 23. He was also appointed Dictator two times, and led the armies of the Republic in the First Samnite War. He occupied the curule chair a total of twenty-one times throughout his career, and according to tradition he lived to be one hundred. Early career A member of the patrician gens Valeria, Valerius first came to prominence in 349 BC when he served as a military tribune under the consul Lucius Furius Camillus who was on campaign against the Gauls of northern Italy.Broughton, pg. 129 According to legend, prior to one battle a gigantic Gallic warrior challenged any Roman to single combat, and Valerius, who asked for and gained the consul‚Äôs permission, accepted. As they approached each other, a raven settled on Valerius‚Äô helmet and it distracted the enemy's attention by flying at his face, allowing Valerius to kill the enemy Gaul. The two armies then fought, resulting in the Gallic forces being comprehensively routed, and ending in a decisive Roman victory.Smith, pg. 861; Forsythe, pg. 306; Arnold, pg. 88 As a reward for his courage, Valerius was apparently given a gift of ten oxen and a golden crown, and he was eventually given the agnomen Corvus, which is the Latin term for a raven.Titus Livius. Periochae. Book 7:10. Regardless of the legend‚Äôs veracity, after this victory Corvus‚Äô popularity soared. He was elected Roman consul in absentia in 348 BC, at the unusually young age of 22. During his first consulship, a treaty was made between Rome and Carthage.Smith, pg. 861; Broughton, pgs. 129-130 In the following year (347 BC) Corvus was probably elected to the office of Praetor.Broughton, pg. 130 This was followed by his second consulship in 346 BC, where he took to the field against the Antiates and the Volsci, defeating them and sacking the town of Satricum, destroying it completely apart from the temple of Mater Matuta.Smith, pg. 861; Broughton, pg. 131 For these victories, the Senate awarded Corvus his first triumph.Broughton, pg. 131 First and Second Samnite Wars In 345 BC, it is believed that Corvus served as Curule aedile, before his outstanding military abilities again saw him being elected to the consulship for the third time in 343 BC.Broughton, pg. 132 This year saw the outbreak of the First Samnite War, and Corvus was dispatched to the warfront, where he won a bruising and bloody victory over the Samnites at the Battle of Mount Gaurus. He followed this up with another victory at the Battle of Suessula, where he crushed the remnants of the Samnite army after their defeat at Mount Gaurus. After the second victory, he had some 40,000 shields of the abandoned and killed and 170 enemy standards piled up before him on the battlefield.Smith, pg. 861; Arnold, pg. 115 After these victories Corvus returned to Rome to celebrate his second triumph, reportedly the most impressive that the Romans had yet witnessed up to that time. After this he returned to the southern warfront in the winter to protect Campania from Samnite incursions.Broughton, pg. 133 The year 342 BC was one of crisis for the Roman state, with the Roman legions stationed around Capua, as well as the surrounding Campanian towns, rebelling and marching on Rome. In this crisis, Corvus was appointed Dictator to deal with the mutineers.Broughton, pg. 133 He met them at the head of an army some eight miles outside of Rome, but decided to negotiate with the rebels instead of fighting a battle. Using his past association with the army to gain their trust, he was able to reach an agreement with the rebels.Oakley, pg. 98; Smith, pg. 862; Arnold, pgs. 120-2 He agreed and pushed through laws (the ne cui militum fraudi secessio fuit)Oakley, pg. 471 which granted the mutinous soldiers immunity from prosecution, prevented the removal of a soldier‚Äôs name from the roll of service without his consent, and prohibited any Military Tribune being demoted down to the rank of centurion.Broughton, pg. 134; Arnold, pg. 123 He however refused to agree to the lowering of the rate of pay for the cavalrymen, and to the immediate execution of the Decemviri.Arnold, pg. 124 It was also alleged that, during the troubles that brought about the passage of the Leges Genuciae, Corvus suggested that the Senate agree to the plebeian demands for the abolition of all debts, but this was rejected out of hand.Arnold, pgs. 126-7 Some historians, such as Gary Forsythe and S. P. Oakley consider the alleged events of the mutiny to be later literary inventions, although the laws passed in this year are accurate.Forsythe, pgs. 272-3; Oakley, pgs. 361-5 In 335 BC, Corvus was elected consul for a fourth time, once again in response to an escalation in the military situation in Italy. The Sidicini had formed an alliance with the Ausones of Cales, and the Senate was keen to send out someone with a proven military record. In a break with tradition, the consuls did not cast lots for their provinces, but the Senate instead assigned the area around Cales directly to Corvus. He besieged and successfully stormed the town; after its capture, the Romans established a colony there of 2,500 men.Broughton, pgs. 139-140; Smith, pg. 862 For this victory, Corvus was granted a third triumph, and the honor of carrying the agnomen Calenus.Livy, Book IX:40-41 In 332 BC, Corvus was appointed as Interrex,Broughton, pg. 142 a function he again fulfilled in 320 BC.Broughton, pg. 153 He was also possibly a legate under the Dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor in 325 BC during the Second Samnite War.Broughton, pg. 148 In 313 BC he was appointed as one of the Triumviri coloniae deducendae, who were given the authority to establish a Latin colony at Saticula.Broughton, pg. 159 Then in 310 BC he was again appointed as a legate under Lucius Papirius Cursor, and fought in a major battle at Longulae against the Samnites.Smith, pg. 862; Broughton, pgs. 162-3 Then in 308 BC he was elected Praetor for the fourth time, as a reward for his services at Longulae.Broughton, pg. 164; Smith, pg. 862The dates for Corvus‚Äô second and third praetorships remain unknown. Most likely his second praetorship occurred after 345 BC, while his third occurred before 308 BC. Later career In 302 BC, Corvus was appointed Dictator for the second time.Broughton, pgs. 169-170 This appointment was brought about by the revolt of the Marsi at Arretium and Carseoli, and Corvus was able not only to defeat them in battle, but to take the fortified towns of Milionia, Plestina and Fresilia.Forsythe, pg. 295; Smith, pg. 862 The Marsi sued for peace, and for his victories over them he was awarded his fourth Triumph.Broughton, pg. 170 For the following year (301 BC), he was again appointed Dictator, this time to engage in operations against the Etruscans.Oakley, pgs. 44-45Broughton, pg. 171; Smith, pg. 862 While Corvus was in Rome taking the auspices, his Magister equitum (probably Marcus Aemilius Paullus)Oakley, pg. 70 was ambushed by the enemy, and forced to retreat to his camp, in the process of which Paullus lost a portion of his army. Corvus, coming quickly to his rescue, engaged and defeated the Etruscans in battle, earning Corvus an additional Triumph.Smith, pg. 862, Broughton, pgs. 170-1The accounts of the events of the years 302-301 are contradictory and many of the details are considered very dubious. It is possible that Corvus was only Dictator for one year, and that his battles against the Etruscans a later literary invention. See Oakley, pgs. 43-47 300 BC saw Corvus elected consul for the fifth time. During his year in office he defeated some rebel Aequians.Broughton, pg. 172; Oakley III, pg. 346 He also was involved in the passage of two laws; the first was his support for the Lex Ogulnia, which resulted in the opening up of the College of Pontifices and the College of Augurs to the Plebeians. The second, which he legislated himself, was the expansion of the provocatio, or right of appeal to the people, which now made illegal the use of severe force, specifically killing or lashing by the higher magistrates, within the city of Rome.Smith, pg, 862; Broughton, pg. 172Bringmann, pg. 45 Then in the following year (299 BC), after the Senate considered appointing him dictator for the fourth time,Oakley, pg. 521 he was elected suffect consul after the death of Titus Manlius Torquatus, who was in command of the Etruscan war. Corvus replaced him, and with his arrival the Etruscans refused to give battle, but remained closed up within their fortified towns. Although Corvus set entire villages on fire to draw them out, the Etruscans refused to engage the Romans under Corvus.Broughton, pg. 173; Smith, pg. 862 After his sixth consulship Corvus retired from public life, and he died at the age of 100, around the year 270 BC. Character and reputation A man with considerable military talents, apparently Corvus also possessed a very kind and amicable nature. Very popular with the soldiers he led into battle, and in the camps he shared with his soldiers, he reportedly competed with them in the athletic games which they played during their leisure time.Smith, pg. 861 He was also an enthusiastic supporter of reform, siding with the Plebeians during the ongoing Conflict of the Orders. His position was that the changing needs of an expanding Roman state required a necessary readjustment of the opportunities provided to Plebeians to serve the state, for the good of Rome.Bringmann, pg, 54 To later Roman writers, he was a memorable example of the favours bestowed by Fortuna, and Augustus erected a statue of Corvus in the Forum of Augustus, alongside the statues of other Roman heroes. Nevertheless, his list of accomplishments is suspiciously long; Valerius Antias is considered to have been responsible for some of the exaggeration.Smith, pg. 862; Oakley, pg. 46 Footnotes Sources =Ancient= * Livy, History of Rome =Modern= * Oakley, S.

They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterparts. Homogeneous coordinates have a range of applications, including computer graphics and 3D computer vision, where they allow affine transformations and, in general, projective transformations to be easily represented by a matrix. If the homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point. Since homogeneous coordinates are also given to points at infinity, the number of coordinates required to allow this extension is one more than the dimension of the projective space being considered. For example, two homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point on the projective line and three homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point in the projective plane. Introduction The real projective plane can be thought of as the Euclidean plane with additional points added, which are called points at infinity, and are considered to lie on a new line, the line at infinity. There is a point at infinity corresponding to each direction (numerically given by the slope of a line), informally defined as the limit of a point that moves in that direction away from the origin. Parallel lines in the Euclidean plane are said to intersect at a point at infinity corresponding to their common direction. Given a point on the Euclidean plane, for any non-zero real number Z, the triple is called a set of homogeneous coordinates for the point. By this definition, multiplying the three homogeneous coordinates by a common, non- zero factor gives a new set of homogeneous coordinates for the same point. In particular, is such a system of homogeneous coordinates for the point . For example, the Cartesian point can be represented in homogeneous coordinates as or . The original Cartesian coordinates are recovered by dividing the first two positions by the third. Thus unlike Cartesian coordinates, a single point can be represented by infinitely many homogeneous coordinates. The equation of a line through the origin may be written where n and m are not both 0. In parametric form this can be written . Let Z = 1/t, so the coordinates of a point on the line may be written . In homogeneous coordinates this becomes . In the limit, as t approaches infinity, in other words, as the point moves away from the origin, Z approaches 0 and the homogeneous coordinates of the point become . Thus we define as the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity corresponding to the direction of the line . As any line of the Euclidean plane is parallel to a line passing through the origin, and since parallel lines have the same point at infinity, the infinite point on every line of the Euclidean plane has been given homogeneous coordinates. To summarize: *Any point in the projective plane is represented by a triple , called the homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates of the point, where X, Y and Z are not all 0. *The point represented by a given set of homogeneous coordinates is unchanged if the coordinates are multiplied by a common factor. *Conversely, two sets of homogeneous coordinates represent the same point if and only if one is obtained from the other by multiplying all the coordinates by the same non-zero constant. *When Z is not 0 the point represented is the point in the Euclidean plane. *When Z is 0 the point represented is a point at infinity. Note that the triple is omitted and does not represent any point. The origin is represented by .For the section: =Notation= Some authors use different notations for homogeneous coordinates which help distinguish them from Cartesian coordinates. The use of colons instead of commas, for example (x:y:z) instead of , emphasizes that the coordinates are to be considered ratios. Square brackets, as in emphasize that multiple sets of coordinates are associated with a single point. Some authors use a combination of colons and square brackets, as in [x:y:z]. Other dimensions The discussion in the preceding section applies analogously to projective spaces other than the plane. So the points on the projective line may be represented by pairs of coordinates , not both zero. In this case, the point at infinity is . Similarly the points in projective n-space are represented by (n + 1)-tuples. Other projective spaces The use of real numbers gives the homogeneous coordinates of points in the classical case of the real projective spaces, however any field may be used, in particular, the complex numbers may be used for complex projective space. For example, the complex projective line uses two homogeneous complex coordinates and is known as the Riemann sphere. Other fields, including finite fields, can be used. Homogeneous coordinates for projective spaces can also be created with elements from a division ring (skewfield). However, in this case, care must be taken to account for the fact that multiplication may not be commutative. For the general ring A, a projective line over A can be defined with homogeneous factors acting on the left and the projective linear group acting on the right. Alternative definition Another definition of the real projective plane can be given in terms of equivalence classes. For non-zero elements of R3, define to mean there is a non-zero Œª so that . Then ~ is an equivalence relation and the projective plane can be defined as the equivalence classes of If is one of the elements of the equivalence class p then these are taken to be homogeneous coordinates of p. Lines in this space are defined to be sets of solutions of equations of the form where not all of a, b and c are zero. The condition depends only on the equivalence class of so the equation defines a set of points in the projective plane. The mapping defines an inclusion from the Euclidean plane to the projective plane and the complement of the image is the set of points with . This is the equation of a line according to the definition and the complement is called the line at infinity. The equivalence classes, p, are the lines through the origin with the origin removed. The origin does not really play an essential part in the previous discussion so it can be added back in without changing the properties of the projective plane. This produces a variation on the definition, namely the projective plane is defined as the set of lines in R3 that pass through the origin and the coordinates of a non-zero element of a line are taken to be homogeneous coordinates of the line. These lines are now interpreted as points in the projective plane. Again, this discussion applies analogously to other dimensions. So the projective space of dimension n can be defined as the set of lines through the origin in Rn+1.For the section: Homogeneity Homogeneous coordinates are not uniquely determined by a point, so a function defined on the coordinates, say , does not determine a function defined on points as with Cartesian coordinates. But a condition defined on the coordinates, as might be used to describe a curve, determines a condition on points if the function is homogeneous. Specifically, suppose there is a k such that :f(\\\\lambda x, \\\\lambda y, \\\\lambda z) = \\\\lambda^k f(x,y,z).\\\\, If a set of coordinates represent the same point as then it can be written for some non- zero value of Œª. Then : f(x,y,z)=0 \\\\iff f(\\\\lambda x, \\\\lambda y, \\\\lambda z) = \\\\lambda^k f(x,y,z)=0. A polynomial of degree k can be turned into a homogeneous polynomial by replacing x with x/z, y with y/z and multiplying by zk, in other words by defining :f(x, y, z)=z^k g(x/z, y/z).\\\\, The resulting function f is a polynomial so it makes sense to extend its domain to triples where . The process can be reversed by setting , or :g(x, y)=f(x, y, 1).\\\\, The equation can then be thought of as the homogeneous form of and it defines the same curve when restricted to the Euclidean plane. For example, the homogeneous form of the equation of the line is For the section: and Line coordinates and duality The equation of a line in the projective plane may be given as where s, t and u are constants. Each triple determines a line, the line determined is unchanged if it is multiplied by a non-zero scalar, and at least one of s, t and u must be non-zero. So the triple may be taken to be homogeneous coordinates of a line in the projective plane, that is line coordinates as opposed to point coordinates. If in sx + ty + uz = 0 the letters s, t and u are taken as variables and x, y and z are taken as constants then the equation becomes an equation of a set of lines in the space of all lines in the plane. Geometrically it represents the set of lines that pass through the point and may be interpreted as the equation of the point in line-coordinates. In the same way, planes in 3-space may be given sets of four homogeneous coordinates, and so on for higher dimensions. (adapted to the plane according to the footnote on p. 108) The same relation, , may be regarded as either the equation of a line or the equation of a point. In general, there is no difference either algebraically or logically between the homogeneous coordinates of points and lines. So plane geometry with points as the fundamental elements and plane geometry with lines as the fundamental elements are equivalent except for interpretation. This leads to the concept of duality in projective geometry, the principle that the roles of points and lines can be interchanged in a theorem in projective geometry and the result will also be a theorem. Analogously, the theory of points in projective 3-space is dual to the theory of planes in projective 3-space, and so on for higher dimensions. Pl√ºcker coordinates Assigning coordinates to lines in projective 3-space is more complicated since it would seem that a total of 8 coordinates, either the coordinates of two points which lie on the line or two planes whose intersection is the line, are required. A useful method, due to Julius Pl√ºcker, creates a set of six coordinates as the determinants from the homogeneous coordinates of two points and on the line. The Pl√ºcker embedding is the generalization of this to create homogeneous coordinates of elements of any dimension m in a projective space of dimension n. Application to B√©zout's theorem B√©zout's theorem predicts that the number of points of intersection of two curves is equal to the product of their degrees (assuming an algebraically closed field and with certain conventions followed for counting intersection multiplicities). B√©zout's theorem predicts there is one point of intersection of two lines and in general this is true, but when the lines are parallel the point of intersection is infinite. Homogeneous coordinates are used to locate the point of intersection in this case. Similarly, B√©zout's theorem predicts that a line will intersect a conic at two points, but in some cases one or both of the points is infinite and homogeneous coordinates must be used to locate them. For example, and have only one point of intersection in the finite (affine) plane. To find the other point of intersection, convert the equations into homogeneous form, and . This produces and, assuming not all of x, y and z are 0, the solutions are and . This first solution is the point in Cartesian coordinates, the finite point of intersection. The second solution gives the homogeneous coordinates which corresponds to the direction of the y-axis. For the equations and there are no finite points of intersection. Converting the equations into homogeneous form gives and . Solving produces the equation which has a double root at . From the original equation, , so since at least one coordinate must be non-zero. Therefore, is the point of intersection counted with multiplicity 2 in agreement with the theorem. with simplified examples. Circular points The homogeneous form for the equation of a circle in the real or complex projective plane is . The intersection of this curve with the line at infinity can be found by setting . This produces the equation which has two solutions over the complex numbers, giving rise to the points with homogeneous coordinates and in the complex projective plane. These points are called the circular points at infinity and can be regarded as the common points of intersection of all circles. This can be generalized to curves of higher order as circular algebraic curves. Change of coordinate systems Just as the selection of axes in the Cartesian coordinate system is somewhat arbitrary, the selection of a single system of homogeneous coordinates out of all possible systems is somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, it is useful to know how the different systems are related to each other. Let be the homogeneous coordinates of a point in the projective plane. A fixed matrix :A=\\\\begin{pmatrix}a&b;&c;\\\\\\\\\\\\d&e;&f;\\\\\\\\\\\\g&h;&i;\\\\end{pmatrix}, with nonzero determinant, defines a new system of coordinates by the equation :\\\\begin{pmatrix}X\\\\\\\\\\\\Y\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z\\\\end{pmatrix}=A\\\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\\\\\\\\\y\\\\\\\\\\\\z\\\\end{pmatrix}. Multiplication of by a scalar results in the multiplication of by the same scalar, and X, Y and Z cannot be all 0 unless x, y and z are all zero since A is nonsingular. So are a new system of homogeneous coordinates for the same point of the projective plane. Barycentric coordinates M√∂bius's original formulation of homogeneous coordinates specified the position of a point as the center of mass (or barycenter) of a system of three point masses placed at the vertices of a fixed triangle. Points within the triangle are represented by positive masses and points outside the triangle are represented by allowing negative masses. Multiplying the masses in the system by a scalar does not affect the center of mass, so this is a special case of a system of homogeneous coordinates. Trilinear coordinates Let l, m, n be three lines in the plane and define a set of coordinates X, Y and Z of a point p as the signed distances from p to these three lines. These are called the trilinear coordinates of p with respect to the triangle whose vertices are the pairwise intersections of the lines. Strictly speaking these are not homogeneous, since the values of X, Y and Z are determined exactly, not just up to proportionality. There is a linear relationship between them however, so these coordinates can be made homogeneous by allowing multiples of to represent the same point. More generally, X, Y and Z can be defined as constants p, r and q times the distances to l, m and n, resulting in a different system of homogeneous coordinates with the same triangle of reference. This is, in fact, the most general type of system of homogeneous coordinates for points in the plane if none of the lines is the line at infinity. Use in computer graphics and computer vision Homogeneous coordinates are ubiquitous in computer graphics because they allow common vector operations such as translation, rotation, scaling and perspective projection to be represented as a matrix by which the vector is multiplied. By the chain rule, any sequence of such operations can be multiplied out into a single matrix, allowing simple and efficient processing. By contrast, using Cartesian coordinates, translations and perspective projection cannot be expressed as matrix multiplications, though other operations can. Modern OpenGL and Direct3D graphics cards take advantage of homogeneous coordinates to implement a vertex shader efficiently using vector processors with 4-element registers.Shreiner, Dave; Woo, Mason; Neider, Jackie; Davis, Tom; \\"OpenGL Programming Guide\\", 4th Edition, , published December 2004. Page 38 and Appendix F (pp. 697-702) Discuss how OpenGL uses homogeneous coordinates in its rendering pipeline. Page 2 indicates that OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. For example, in perspective projection, a position in space is associated with the line from it to a fixed point called the center of projection. The point is then mapped to a plane by finding the point of intersection of that plane and the line. This produces an accurate representation of how a three-dimensional object appears to the eye. In the simplest situation, the center of projection is the origin and points are mapped to the plane , working for the moment in Cartesian coordinates. For a given point in space, , the point where the line and the plane intersect is . Dropping the now superfluous z coordinate, this becomes . In homogeneous coordinates, the point is represented by and the point it maps to on the plane is represented by , so projection can be represented in matrix form as :\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&1&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&1&0\\\\end{pmatrix} Matrices representing other geometric transformations can be combined with this and each other by matrix multiplication. As a result, any perspective projection of space can be represented as a single matrix.

It enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure and innervates extrinsic eye muscles that enable most movements of the eye and that raise the eyelid. The nerve also contains fibers that innervate the intrinsic eye muscles that enable pupillary constriction and accommodation (ability to focus on near objects as in reading). The oculomotor nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic midbrain. Cranial nerves IV and VI also participate in control of eye movement. Structure The oculomotor nerve originates from the third nerve nucleus at the level of the superior colliculus in the midbrain. The third nerve nucleus is located ventral to the cerebral aqueduct, on the pre- aqueductal grey matter. The fibers from the two third nerve nuclei located laterally on either side of the cerebral aqueduct then pass through the red nucleus. From the red nucleus fibers then pass via the substantia nigra exiting through the interpeduncular fossa. On emerging from the brainstem, the nerve is invested with a sheath of pia mater, and enclosed in a prolongation from the arachnoid. It passes between the superior cerebellar (below) and posterior cerebral arteries (above), and then pierces the dura mater anterior and lateral to the posterior clinoid process, passing between the free and attached borders of the tentorium cerebelli. It traverses the cavernous sinus, above the other orbital nerves receiving in its course one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic nervous system, and a communicating branch from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. As the oculomotor nerve enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure it then divides into a superior and an inferior branch. =Superior branch= The superior branch of the oculomotor nerve or the superior division, the smaller, passes medially over the optic nerve. It supplies the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris. =Inferior branch= The inferior branch of the oculomotor nerve or the inferior division, the larger, divides into three branches. * One passes beneath the optic nerve to the medial rectus. * Another, to the inferior rectus. * The third and longest runs forward between the inferior recti and lateralis to the inferior oblique. *From the third one, a short thick branch is given off to the lower part of the ciliary ganglion, and forms its short root. All these branches enter the muscles on their ocular surfaces, with the exception of the nerve to the inferior oblique, which enters the muscle at its posterior border. =Nuclei= The oculomotor nerve (CN III) arises from the anterior aspect of mesencephalon (midbrain). There are two nuclei for the oculomotor nerve: * The oculomotor nucleus originates at the level of the superior colliculus. The muscles it controls are the striated muscle in levator palpebrae superioris and all extraocular muscles except for the superior oblique muscle and the lateral rectus muscle. * The Edinger-Westphal nucleus supplies parasympathetic fibers to the eye via the ciliary ganglion, and thus controls the sphincter pupillae muscle (affecting pupil constriction) and the ciliary muscle (affecting accommodation). Sympathetic postganglionic fibres also join the nerve from the plexus on the internal carotid artery in the wall of the cavernous sinus and are distributed through the nerve, e.g., to the smooth muscle of superior tarsal (Mueller's) muscle. Function The oculomotor nerve include axons of type GSE, general somatic efferent, which innervate skeletal muscle of the levator palpebrae superioris, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles.(innervates all the extrinsic muscles except superior oblique and lateral rectus.) The nerve also includes axons of type GVE, general visceral efferent, which provide preganglionic parasympathetics to the ciliary ganglion. From the ciliary ganglion post ganglionic fibers pass through the short ciliary nerve to the constrictor pupillae of the iris and the cilliary muscles. Clinical significance =Disease= Paralysis of the oculomotor nerve, i.e., oculomotor nerve palsy, can arise due to: *direct trauma, *demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), *increased intracranial pressure (leading to uncal herniation) **due to a space-occupying lesion (e.g., brain cancer) or a **spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (e.g., berry aneurysm), and *microvascular disease, e.g., diabetes. In people with diabetes and older than 50 years of age, an oculomotor nerve palsy, in the classical sense, occurs with sparing (or preservation) of the pupillary reflex. This is thought to arise due to the anatomical arrangement of the nerve fibers in the oculomotor nerve; fibers controlling the pupillary function are superficial and spared from ischemic injuries typical of diabetes. On the converse, an aneurysm which leads to compression of the oculomotor nerve affects the superficial fibers and manifests as a third nerve palsy with loss of the pupillary reflex (in fact, this third nerve finding is considered to represent an aneurysm‚Äîuntil proven otherwise‚Äîand should be investigated). =Examination= Eye muscles Cranial nerves III, IV, and VI are usually tested together as part of the cranial nerve examination. The examiner typically instructs the patient to hold his head still and follow only with the eyes a finger or penlight that circumscribes a large \\"H\\" in front of the patient. By observing the eye movement and eyelids, the examiner is able to obtain more information about the extraocular muscles, the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, and cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Loss of function of any of the eye muscles results in ophthalmoparesis. Since the oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye muscles, it may be easier to detect damage to it. Damage to this nerve, termed oculomotor nerve palsy, is known by its down and out symptoms, because of the position of the affected eye (lateral, downward deviation of gaze). Pupillary reflex The oculomotor nerve also controls the constriction of the pupils and thickening of the lens of the eye. This can be tested in two main ways. By moving a finger toward a person's face to induce accommodation, their pupils should constrict. Shining a light into one eye should result in equal constriction of the other eye. The neurons in the optic nerve decussate in the optic chiasm with some crossing to the contralateral optic nerve tract. This is the basis of the \\"swinging-flashlight test\\". Loss of accommodation and continued pupillary dilation can indicate the presence of a lesion on the oculomotor nerve. Additional images File:Cranial nerve III visceral.svgMap of the oculomotor nerve.

The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects: * It is the smallest nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains. * It has the greatest intracranial length. * It is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal (rear) aspect of the brainstem. * It innervates a muscle, the superior oblique muscle, on the opposite side (contralateral) from its nucleus. The trochlear nerve decussates within the brainstem before emerging on the contralateral side of the brainstem (at the level of the inferior colliculus). An injury to the trochlear nucleus in the brainstem will result in an contralateral superior oblique muscle palsy, whereas an injury to the trochlear nerve (after it has emerged from the brainstem) results in an ipsilateral superior oblique muscle palsy. Homologous trochlear nerves are found in all jawed vertebrates. The unique features of the trochlear nerve, including its dorsal exit from the brainstem and its contralateral innervation, are seen in the primitive brains of sharks.Maisey JG. Morphology of the Braincase in the Broadnose Sevengill Shark Notorynchus (Elasombranchii, Hexanchiformes), Based on CT Scanning. American Museum Novitates, Number 3429. New York: American Museum of Natural History, 2004 The human trochlear nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic midbrain. The words trochlea and trochlear (, ) come from Ancient Greek trokhil√©a, ‚Äúpulley; block-and-tackle equipment‚Äù. Structure The Cavernous Sinus The trochlear nerve emerges from the back (dorsal) brainstem, just below the inferior colliculus. It circles from behind around the brainstem and runs forward toward the eye in the subarachnoid space. It passes between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery, and then pierces the dura just under free margin of the tentorium cerebelli, close to the crossing of the attached margin of the tentorium and within millimeters of the posterior clinoid process.Bisaria KK. \\"Cavernous portion of the trochlear nerve with special reference to its site of entrance\\". J. Anat. 159:29‚Äì35, 1988 It runs on the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. Finally, it enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and supplies the superior oblique muscle. =Nucleus= Transverse Section of the Brainstem at the level of the Inferior Colliculus The nucleus of the trochlear nerve is located in the caudal mesencephalon beneath the cerebral aqueduct. It is immediately below the nucleus of the oculomotor nerve (III) in the rostral mesencephalon. The trochlear nucleus is unique in that its axons run dorsally and cross the midline before emerging from the brainstem posteriorly. Thus a lesion of the trochlear nucleus affects the contralateral eye. Lesions of all other cranial nuclei affect the ipsilateral side. Function The trochlear nerve provides motor supply to the superior oblique muscle of the eye, The trochlear nerve carries axons of type GSE, general somatic efferent, which innervate skeletal muscle of the superior oblique muscle. The superior oblique muscle ends in a tendon that passes through a fibrous loop, the trochlea, located anteriorly on the medial aspect of the orbit. Trochlea means ‚Äúpulley‚Äù in Latin; the fourth nerve is named after this structure. =Actions of the superior oblique muscle= In order to understand the actions of the superior oblique muscle, it is useful to imagine the eyeball as a sphere that is constrained‚Äîlike the trackball of a computer mouse‚Äîin such a way that only certain rotational movements are possible. Allowable movements for the superior oblique are (1) rotation in a vertical plane‚Äîlooking down and up (depression and elevation of the eyeball) and (2) rotation in the plane of the face (intorsion and extorsion of the eyeball). The body of the superior oblique muscle is located behind the eyeball, but the tendon (which is redirected by the trochlea) approaches the eyeball from the front. The tendon attaches to the top (superior aspect) of the eyeball at an angle of 51 degrees with respect to the primary position of the eye (looking straight forward). The force of the tendon's pull therefore has two components: a forward component that tends to pull the eyeball downward (depression), and a medial component that tends to rotate the top of the eyeball toward the nose (intorsion). The relative strength of these two forces depends on which way the eye is looking. When the eye is adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the eye is abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the eye is in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts. To summarize, the actions of the superior oblique muscle are (1) depression of the eyeball, especially when the eye is adducted; and (2) intorsion of the eyeball, especially when the eye is abducted. The clinical consequences of weakness in the superior oblique (caused, for example, by fourth nerve palsies) are discussed below. This summary of the superior oblique muscle describes its most important functions. However, it is an oversimplification of the actual situation. For example, the tendon of the superior oblique inserts behind the equator of the eyeball in the frontal plane, so contraction of the muscle also tends to abduct the eyeball (turn it outward). In fact, each of the six extraocular muscles exerts rotational forces in all three planes (elevation- depression, adduction-abduction, intorsion-extorsion) to varying degrees, depending on which way the eye is looking. The relative forces change every time the eyeball moves‚Äîevery time the direction of gaze changes. The central control of this process, which involves the continuous, precise adjustment of forces on twelve different tendons in order to point both eyes in exactly the same direction, is truly remarkable. The recent discovery of soft tissue pulleys in the orbit‚Äîsimilar to the trochlea, but anatomically more subtle and previously missed‚Äîhas completely changed and greatly simplified our understanding of the actions of the extraocular muscles.Demer JL. Pivotal Role of Orbital Connective Tissues in Binocular Alignment and Strabismus. Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science. 2004;45:729-738 Perhaps the most important finding is that a two-dimensional representation of the visual field is sufficient for most purposes. Clinical significance =Vertical diplopia= Injury to the trochlear nerve cause weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia (double vision). The affected eye drifts upward relative to the normal eye, due to the unopposed actions of the remaining extraocular muscles. The patient sees two visual fields (one from each eye), separated vertically. To compensate for this, patients learn to tilt the head forward (tuck the chin in) in order to bring the fields back together‚Äîto fuse the two images into a single visual field. This accounts for the ‚Äúdejected‚Äù appearance of patients with ‚Äúpathetic nerve‚Äù palsies. =Torsional diplopia= Trochlear nerve palsy also affects torsion (rotation of the eyeball in the plane of the face). Torsion is a normal response to tilting the head sideways. The eyes automatically rotate in an equal and opposite direction, so that the orientation of the environment remains unchanged‚Äîvertical things remain vertical. Weakness of intorsion results in torsional diplopia, in which two different visual fields, tilted with respect to each other, are seen at the same time. To compensate for this, patients with trochlear nerve palsies tilt their heads to the opposite side, in order to fuse the two images into a single visual field. The characteristic appearance of patients with fourth nerve palsies (head tilted to one side, chin tucked in) suggests the diagnosis, but other causes must be ruled out. For example, torticollis can produce a similar appearance. =Causes= The clinical syndromes can originate from both peripheral and central lesions. Peripheral lesion A peripheral lesion is damage to the bundle of nerves, in contrast to a central lesion, which is damage to the trochlear nucleus. Acute symptoms are probably a result of trauma or disease, while chronic symptoms probably are congenital. =Acute palsy= The most common cause of acute fourth nerve palsy is head trauma.Hoya K, Kirino T. Traumatic Trochlear Nerve Palsy Following Minor Occipital Impact. Neurol Med Chir 40:358-360, 2000 Even relatively minor trauma can transiently stretch the fourth nerve (by transiently displacing the brainstem relative to the posterior clinoid process). Patients with minor damage to the fourth nerve will complain of ‚Äúblurry‚Äù vision. Patients with more extensive damage will notice frank diplopia and rotational (torsional) disturbances of the visual fields. The usual clinical course is complete recovery within weeks to months. Isolated injury to the fourth nerve can be caused by any process that stretches or compresses the nerve. A generalized increase in intracranial pressure‚Äîhydrocephalus, pseudotumor cerebri, hemorrhage, edema‚Äîwill affect the fourth nerve, but the abducens nerve (VI) is usually affected first (producing horizontal diplopia, not vertical diplopia). Infections (meningitis, herpes zoster), demyelination (multiple sclerosis), diabetic neuropathy and cavernous sinus disease can affect the fourth nerve, as can orbital tumors and Tolosa‚ÄìHunt syndrome. In general, these diseases affect other cranial nerves as well. Isolated damage to the fourth nerve is uncommon in these settings. =Chronic palsy= The most common cause of chronic fourth nerve palsy is a congenital defect, in which the development of the fourth nerve (or its nucleus) is abnormal or incomplete. Congenital defects may be noticed in childhood, but minor defects may not become evident until adult life, when compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Congenital fourth nerve palsies are amenable to surgical treatment. Central lesion Central damage is damage to the trochlear nucleus. It affects the contralateral eye. The nuclei of other cranial nerves generally affect ipsilateral structures (for example, the optic nerves - cranial nerves II - innervate both eyes). The trochlear nucleus and its axons within the brainstem can be damaged by infarctions, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, tumors and demyelination. Collateral damage to other structures will usually dominate the clinical picture. The fourth nerve is one of the final common pathways for cortical systems that control eye movement in general. Cortical control of eye movement (saccades, smooth pursuit, accommodation) involves conjugate gaze, not unilateral eye movement. =Examination= The trochlear nerve is tested by examining the action of its muscle, the superior oblique. When acting on its own this muscle depresses and abducts the eyeball. However, movements of the eye by the extraocular muscles are synergistic (working together). Therefore, the trochlear nerve is tested by asking the patient to look 'down and in' as the contribution of the superior oblique is greatest in this motion. Common activities requiring this type of convergent gaze are reading the newspaper and walking down stairs. Diplopia associated with these activities may be the initial symptom of a fourth nerve palsy. Alfred Bielschowsky's head tilt test is a test for palsy of the superior oblique muscle caused by damage to cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve). History See also References Bibliography *Blumenfeld H.

Its name (\\"trigeminal\\" = tri-, or three, and - geminus, or twin: thrice-twinned) derives from the fact that each of the two nerves (one on each side of the pons) has three major branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory, whereas the mandibular nerve supplies motor as well as sensory (or \\"cutaneous\\") functions. Adding to the complexity of this nerve is the fact that autonomic nerve fibers as well as special sensory fibers (taste) are contained within it. The motor division of the trigeminal nerve derives from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, and the sensory division originates in the cranial neural crest. Sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system. Structure The three major branches of the trigeminal nerve‚Äîthe ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2) and the mandibular nerve (V3)‚Äîconverge on the trigeminal ganglion (also called the semilunar ganglion or gasserian ganglion), located within Meckel's cave and containing the cell bodies of incoming sensory-nerve fibers. The trigeminal ganglion is analogous to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, which contain the cell bodies of incoming sensory fibers from the rest of the body. From the trigeminal ganglion a single, large sensory root enters the brainstem at the level of the pons. Immediately adjacent to the sensory root, a smaller motor root emerges from the pons at the same level. Motor fibers pass through the trigeminal ganglion without synapsing on their way to peripheral muscles, but their cell bodies are located in the nucleus of the fifth nerve, deep within the pons. Dermatome distribution of the trigeminal nerve The areas of cutaneous distribution (dermatomes) of the three sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve have sharp borders with relatively little overlap (unlike dermatomes in the rest of the body, which have considerable overlap). The injection of a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, results in the complete loss of sensation from well-defined areas of the face and mouth. For example, teeth on one side of the jaw can be numbed by injecting the mandibular nerve. Occasionally, injury or disease processes may affect two (or all three) branches of the trigeminal nerve; in these cases, the involved branches may be termed: * V1/V2 distribution ‚Äì Referring to the ophthalmic and maxillary branches * V2/V3 distribution ‚Äì Referring to the maxillary and mandibular branches * V1-V3 distribution ‚Äì Referring to all three branches Nerves on the left side of the jaw slightly outnumber the nerves on the right side of the jaw. =Sensory branches= Dermatome distribution of the trigeminal nerve The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular branches leave the skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory information from the scalp and forehead, the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including the tip of the nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch- position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches‚Äîthe lingual nerve‚Äîcarries sensation from the tongue. The peripheral processes of mesencephalic nucleus of V neurons run in the motor root of the trigeminal nerve and terminate in the muscle spindles in the muscles of mastication. They are proprioceptive fibers, conveying information regarding the location of the masticatory muscles. The central processes of mesencephalic V neurons synapse in the motor nucleus V. Function The sensory function of the trigeminal nerve is to provide tactile, proprioceptive, and nociceptive afference to the face and mouth. Its motor function activates the muscles of mastication, the tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric. The trigeminal nerve carries general somatic afferent fibers (GSA), which innervate the skin of the face via ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions. The trigeminal nerve also carries special visceral efferent (SVE) axons, which innervate the muscles of mastication via the mandibular (V3) division. =Muscles of mastication= The motor component of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve controls the movement of eight muscles, including the four muscles of mastication: the masseter, the temporal muscle, and the medial and lateral pterygoids. The other four muscles are the tensor veli palatini, the mylohyoid, the anterior belly of the digastric and the tensor tympani. A useful mnemonic for remembering these muscles is \\"My Tensors Dig Ants 4 MoM\\" (Mylohyoid‚ÄîTensor Tympani + Tensor Veli Palatini‚ÄîDigastric (Anterior) ‚Äì 4 Muscles of Mastication (Temporalis, Masseter, Medial and Lateral Pterygoids)) With the exception of the tensor tympani, all these muscles are involved in biting, chewing and swallowing and all have bilateral cortical representation. A unilateral central lesion (for example, a stroke), no matter how large, is unlikely to produce an observable deficit. Injury to a peripheral nerve can cause paralysis of muscles on one side of the jaw, with the jaw deviating towards the paralyzed side when it opens. This direction of the mandible is due to the action of the functioning pterygoids on the opposite side. =Sensation= The two basic types of sensation are touch- position and pain-temperature. Touch-position input comes to attention immediately, but pain-temperature input reaches the level of consciousness after a delay; when a person steps on a pin, the awareness of stepping on something is immediate but the pain associated with it is delayed. Touch- position information is generally carried by myelinated (fast-conducting) nerve fibers, and pain-temperature information by unmyelinated (slow- conducting) fibers. The primary sensory receptors for touch-position (Meissner‚Äôs corpuscles, Merkel's receptors, Pacinian corpuscles, Ruffini‚Äôs corpuscles, hair receptors, muscle spindle organs and Golgi tendon organs) are structurally more complex than those for pain-temperature, which are nerve endings. Sensation in this context refers to the conscious perception of touch-position and pain-temperature information, rather than the special senses (smell, sight, taste, hearing and balance) processed by different cranial nerves and sent to the cerebral cortex through different pathways. The perception of magnetic fields, electrical fields, low-frequency vibrations and infrared radiation by some nonhuman vertebrates is processed by their equivalent of the fifth cranial nerve. Touch in this context refers to the perception of detailed, localized tactile information, such as two-point discrimination (the difference between touching one point and two closely spaced points) or the difference between coarse, medium or fine sandpaper. People without touch-position perception can feel the surface of their bodies and perceive touch in a broad sense, but they lack perceptual detail. Position, in this context, refers to conscious proprioception. Proprioceptors (muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organs) provide information about joint position and muscle movement. Although much of this information is processed at an unconscious level (primarily by the cerebellum and the vestibular nuclei), some is available at a conscious level. Touch-position and pain- temperature sensations are processed by different pathways in the central nervous system. This hard-wired distinction is maintained up to the cerebral cortex. Within the cerebral cortex, sensations are linked with other cortical areas. =Sensory pathways= Sensory pathways from the periphery to the cortex are separate for touch-position and pain-temperature sensations. All sensory information is sent to specific nuclei in the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei, in turn, send information to specific areas in the cerebral cortex. Each pathway consists of three bundles of nerve fibers connected in series: alt=Flow chart from sensory receptors to the cerebral cortex The secondary neurons in each pathway decussate (cross the spinal cord or brainstem), because the spinal cord develops in segments. Decussated fibers later reach and connect these segments with the higher centers. The optic chiasm is the primary cause of decussation; nasal fibers of the optic nerve cross (so each cerebral hemisphere receives contralateral‚Äîopposite‚Äîvision) to keep the interneuronal connections responsible for processing information short. All sensory and motor pathways converge and diverge to the contralateral hemisphere.Excerpt from Cunningham's Textbook of Anatomy Although sensory pathways are often depicted as chains of individual neurons connected in series, this is an oversimplification. Sensory information is processed and modified at each level in the chain by interneurons and input from other areas of the nervous system. For example, cells in the main trigeminal nucleus (Main V in the diagram below) receive input from the reticular formation and cerebral cortex. This information contributes to the final output of the cells in Main V to the thalamus. C = Cervical segment, S = Sacral segment, VPL = Ventral posterolateral nucleus, SI = Primary somatosensory cortex, VM = Ventromedial prefrontal cortex, MD = Medial dorsal thalamic nucleus, IL = Intralaminar nucleus, VPM = Ventral posteromedial nucleus, Main V = Main trigeminal nucleus, Spinal V = Spinal trigeminal nucleus Touch-position information from the body is carried to the thalamus by the medial lemniscus, and from the face by the trigeminal lemniscus (both the anterior and posterior trigeminothalamic tracts). Pain-temperature information from the body is carried to the thalamus by the spinothalamic tract, and from the face by the anterior division of the trigeminal lemniscus (also called the anterior trigeminothalamic tract). Pathways for touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the face and body merge in the brainstem, and touch-position and pain-temperature sensory maps of the entire body are projected onto the thalamus. From the thalamus, touch-position and pain-temperature information is projected onto the cerebral cortex. =Summary= The complex processing of pain-temperature information in the thalamus and cerebral cortex (as opposed to the relatively simple, straightforward processing of touch-position information) reflects a phylogenetically older, more primitive sensory system. The detailed information received from peripheral touch-position receptors is superimposed on a background of awareness, memory and emotions partially set by peripheral pain-temperature receptors. Although thresholds for touch- position perception are relatively easy to measure, those for pain-temperature perception are difficult to define and measure. \\"Touch\\" is an objective sensation, but \\"pain\\" is an individualized sensation which varies among different people and is conditioned by memory and emotion. Anatomical differences between the pathways for touch-position perception and pain- temperature sensation help explain why pain, especially chronic pain, is difficult to manage. Trigeminal nucleus Brainstem nuclei: Red = Motor; Blue = Sensory; Dark blue = Trigeminal nucleus All sensory information from the face, both touch-position and pain-temperature, is sent to the trigeminal nucleus. In classical anatomy most sensory information from the face is carried by the fifth nerve, but sensation from parts of the mouth, parts of the ear and parts of the meninges is carried by general somatic afferent fibers in cranial nerves VII (the facial nerve), IX (the glossopharyngeal nerve) and X (the vagus nerve). All sensory fibers from these nerves terminate in the trigeminal nucleus. On entering the brainstem, sensory fibers from V, VII, IX and X are sorted and sent to the trigeminal nucleus (which contains a sensory map of the face and mouth). The spinal counterparts of the trigeminal nucleus (cells in the dorsal horn and dorsal column nuclei of the spinal cord) contain a sensory map of the rest of the body. The trigeminal nucleus extends throughout the brainstem, from the midbrain to the medulla, continuing into the cervical cord (where it merges with the dorsal horn cells of the spinal cord). The nucleus is divided into three parts, visible in microscopic sections of the brainstem. From caudal to rostral (ascending from the medulla to the midbrain), they are the spinal trigeminal, the principal sensory and the mesencephalic nuclei. The parts of the trigeminal nucleus receive different types of sensory information; the spinal trigeminal nucleus receives pain-temperature fibers, the principal sensory nucleus receives touch-position fibers and the mesencephalic nucleus receives proprioceptor and mechanoreceptor fibers from the jaws and teeth. =Spinal trigeminal nucleus= The spinal trigeminal nucleus represents pain-temperature sensation from the face. Pain-temperature fibers from peripheral nociceptors are carried in cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X. On entering the brainstem, sensory fibers are grouped and sent to the spinal trigeminal nucleus. This bundle of incoming fibers can be identified in cross-sections of the pons and medulla as the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus, which parallels the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The spinal tract of V is analogous to, and continuous with, Lissauer's tract in the spinal cord. The spinal trigeminal nucleus contains a pain-temperature sensory map of the face and mouth. From the spinal trigeminal nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the trigeminothalamic (quintothalamic) tract to the contralateral thalamus. Pain- temperature fibers are sent to multiple thalamic nuclei. The central processing of pain-temperature information differs from the processing of touch-position information. Somatotopic representation Onion-skin distribution of the trigeminal nerve Exactly how pain-temperature fibers from the face are distributed to the spinal trigeminal nucleus is disputed. The present general understanding is that pain-temperature information from all areas of the human body is represented in the spinal cord and brainstem in an ascending, caudal-to-rostral fashion. Information from the lower extremities is represented in the lumbar cord, and that from the upper extremities in the thoracic cord. Information from the neck and the back of the head is represented in the cervical cord, and that from the face and mouth in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, information is represented in a layered, or \\"onion-skin\\" fashion. The lowest levels of the nucleus (in the upper cervical cord and lower medulla) represent peripheral areas of the face (the scalp, ears and chin). Higher levels (in the upper medulla) represent central areas (nose, cheeks and lips). The highest levels (in the pons) represent the mouth, teeth and pharyngeal cavity. The onion skin distribution differs from the dermatome distribution of the peripheral branches of the fifth nerve. Lesions which destroy lower areas of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (but spare higher areas) preserve pain-temperature sensation in the nose (V1), upper lip (V2) and mouth (V3) and remove pain- temperature sensation from the forehead (V1), cheeks (V2) and chin (V3). Although analgesia in this distribution is \\"nonphysiologic\\" in the traditional sense (because it crosses several dermatomes), this analgesia is found in humans after surgical sectioning of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus. The spinal trigeminal nucleus sends pain-temperature information to the thalamus and sends information to the mesencephalon and the reticular formation of the brainstem. The latter pathways are analogous to the spinomesencephalic and spinoreticular tracts of the spinal cord, which send pain-temperature information from the rest of the body to the same areas. The mesencephalon modulates painful input before it reaches the level of consciousness. The reticular formation is responsible for the automatic (unconscious) orientation of the body to painful stimuli. Incidentally, Sulfur-containing compounds found in plants in the onion family stimulate receptors found in trigeminal ganglia, bypassing the olfactory system. =Principal nucleus= The principal nucleus represents touch-position sensation from the face. It is located in the pons, near the entrance for the fifth nerve. Fibers carrying touch-position information from the face and mouth via cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X are sent to this nucleus when they enter the brainstem. The principal nucleus contains a touch-position sensory map of the face and mouth, just as the spinal trigeminal nucleus contains a complete pain-temperature map. This nucleus is analogous to the dorsal column nuclei (the gracile and cuneate nuclei) of the spinal cord, which contain a touch-position map of the rest of the body. From the principal nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the ventral trigeminothalamic tract to the contralateral thalamus. The ventral trigeminothalamic tract runs parallel to the medial lemniscus, which carries touch-position information from the rest of the body to the thalamus. Some sensory information from the teeth and jaws is sent from the principal nucleus to the ipsilateral thalamus via the small dorsal trigeminal tract. Touch-position information from the teeth and jaws of one side of the face is represented bilaterally in the thalamus and cortex. =Mesencephalic nucleus= The mesencephalic nucleus is not a true nucleus; it is a sensory ganglion (like the trigeminal ganglion) embedded in the brainstem and the sole exception to the rule that sensory information passes through peripheral sensory ganglia before entering the central nervous system. It has been found in all vertebrates except lampreys and hagfishes. They are the only vertebrates without jaws and have specific cells in their brainstems. These \\"internal ganglion\\" cells were discovered in the late 19th century by medical student Sigmund Freud. Two types of sensory fibers have cell bodies in the mesencephalic nucleus: proprioceptor fibers from the jaw and mechanoreceptor fibers from the teeth. Some of these incoming fibers go to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (V), bypassing the pathways for conscious perception. The jaw jerk reflex is an example; tapping the jaw elicits a reflex closure of the jaw in the same way that tapping the knee elicits a reflex kick of the lower leg. Other incoming fibers from the teeth and jaws go to the main nucleus of V. This information is projected bilaterally to the thalamus and available for conscious perception. Activities such as biting, chewing and swallowing require symmetrical, simultaneous coordination of both sides of the body. They are automatic activities, requiring little conscious attention and involving a sensory component (feedback about touch-position) processed at the unconscious level in the mesencephalic nucleus. =Pathways to the thalamus and cortex= Sensation has been defined as the conscious perception of touch-position and pain- temperature information. With the exception of smell, all sensory input (touch-position, pain-temperature, sight, taste, hearing and balance) is sent to the thalamus and then the cortex. The thalamus is anatomically subdivided into nuclei. =Touch-position sensation= Cortical homunculus Touch-position information from the body is sent to the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Touch-position information from the face is sent to the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus. From the VPL and VPM, information is projected to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in the parietal lobe. The representation of sensory information in the postcentral gyrus is organized somatotopically. Adjacent areas of the body are represented by adjacent areas in the cortex. When body parts are drawn in proportion to the density of their innervation, the result is a \\"little man\\": the cortical homunculus. Many textbooks have reproduced the outdated Penfield-Rasmussen diagram [ref?], with the toes and genitals on the mesial surface of the cortex when they are actually represented on the convexity. The classic diagram implies a single primary sensory map of the body, when there are multiple primary maps. At least four separate, anatomically distinct sensory homunculi have been identified in the postcentral gyrus. They represent combinations of input from surface and deep receptors and rapidly and slowly adapting peripheral receptors; smooth objects will activate certain cells, and rough objects will activate other cells. Information from all four maps in SI is sent to the secondary sensory cortex (SII) in the parietal lobe. SII contains two more sensory homunculi. Information from one side of the body is generally represented on the opposite side in SI, but on both sides in SII. Functional MRI imaging of a defined stimulus (for example, stroking the skin with a toothbrush) \\"lights up\\" a single focus in SI and two foci in SII. =Pain- temperature sensation= Pain-temperature information is sent to the VPL (body) and VPM (face) of the thalamus (the same nuclei which receive touch- position information). From the thalamus, pain-temperature and touch-position information is projected onto SI. Unlike touch-position information, however, pain-temperature information is also sent to other thalamic nuclei and projected onto additional areas of the cerebral cortex. Some pain-temperature fibers are sent to the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), which projects to the anterior cingulate cortex. Other fibers are sent to the ventromedial (VM) nucleus of the thalamus, which projects to the insular cortex. Finally, some fibers are sent to the intralaminar nucleus (IL) of the thalamus via the reticular formation. The IL projects diffusely to all parts of the cerebral cortex. The insular and cingulate cortices are parts of the brain which represent touch-position and pain-temperature in the context of other simultaneous perceptions (sight, smell, taste, hearing and balance) in the context of memory and emotional state. Peripheral pain-temperature information is channeled directly to the brain at a deep level, without prior processing. Touch-position information is handled differently. Diffuse thalamic projections from the IL and other thalamic nuclei are responsible for a given level of consciousness, with the thalamus and reticular formation \\"activating\\" the brain; peripheral pain-temperature information also feeds directly into this system. Clinical significance *Trigeminal neuralgia *Cluster headache =Wallenberg syndrome= Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome) is a clinical demonstration of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve, summarizing how it processes sensory information. A stroke usually affects only one side of the body; loss of sensation due to a stroke will be lateralized to the right or the left side of the body. The only exceptions to this rule are certain spinal-cord lesions and the medullary syndromes, of which Wallenberg syndrome is the best-known example. In this syndrome, a stroke causes a loss of pain-temperature sensation from one side of the face and the other side of the body. This is explained by the anatomy of the brainstem. In the medulla, the ascending spinothalamic tract (which carries pain-temperature information from the opposite side of the body) is adjacent to the ascending spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve (which carries pain-temperature information from the same side of the face). A stroke which cuts off the blood supply to this area (for example, a clot in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery) destroys both tracts simultaneously. The result is a loss of pain-temperature (but not touch-position) sensation in a \\"checkerboard\\" pattern (ipsilateral face, contralateral body), facilitating diagnosis.

Through olivocochlear fibers, this nerve also transmit motor and modulatory information from the superior olivary complex in the brainstem to the cochlea. Structure The vestibulocochlear nerve consists mostly of bipolar neurons and splits into two large divisions: the cochlear nerve and the vestibular nerve. Cranial nerve 8, the vestibulocochlear nerve, goes to the middle portion of the brainstem called the pons, (which then is largely composed of fibers going to the cerebellum). The 8th cranial nerve runs between the base of the pons (the middle portion of the brainstem) and medulla oblongata (the lower portion of the brainstem). This junction between the pons, medulla, and cerebellum that contains the 8th nerve is called the cerebellopontine angle. The vestibulocochlear nerve is accompanied by the labyrinthine artery, which usually branches off from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) at the cerebellopontine angle, and then goes with the 7th nerve through the internal acoustic meatus to the internal ear. The cochlear nerve travels away from the cochlea of the inner ear where it starts as the spiral ganglia. Processes from the organ of Corti conduct afferent transmission to the spiral ganglia. It is the inner hair cells of the organ of Corti that are responsible for activation of afferent receptors in response to pressure waves reaching the basilar membrane through the transduction of sound. The exact mechanism by which sound is transmitted by the neurons of the cochlear nerve is uncertain; the two competing theories are place theory and temporal theory. The vestibular nerve travels from the vestibular system of the inner ear. The vestibular ganglion houses the cell bodies of the bipolar neurons and extends processes to five sensory organs. Three of these are the cristae located in the ampullae of the semicircular canals. Hair cells of the cristae activate afferent receptors in response to rotational acceleration. The other two sensory organs supplied by the vestibular neurons are the maculae of the saccule and utricle. Hair cells of the maculae in the utricle activate afferent receptors in response to linear acceleration while hair cells of the maculae in the saccule respond to vertically directed linear force. =Development= The vestibulocochlear nerve is derived from the embryonic otic placode. Function This is the nerve along which the sensory cells (the hair cells) of the inner ear transmit information to the brain. It consists of the cochlear nerve, carrying information about hearing, and the vestibular nerve, carrying information about balance. It emerges from the pontomedullary junction and exits the inner skull via the internal acoustic meatus (or internal auditory meatus) in the temporal bone. The vestibulocochlear nerve carries axons of type SSA, special somatic afferent, which carry the modalities of hearing and equilibrium. Clinical significance =Symptoms of damage= Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve may cause the following symptoms: *hearing loss *vertigo *false sense of motion *loss of equilibrium (in dark places) *nystagmus *motion sickness *gaze-evoked tinnitus. =Examination= Examinations that can be done include the Rinne test and the Weber test. Rinne's test involves Rinne's Right Test and Rinne's Left Test since auditory acuity is equal in both ears. If Bone Conduction(BC) is more than Air Conduction(AC) i.e. BC>AC indicates Rinne Test is negative or abnormal. If AC>BC Rinne test is normal or positive. If BC>AC and Weber's test lateralizes to abnormal side then it is Conductive hearing loss. If AC>BC and Weber's test lateralizes to normal side then it concludes Sensorineural hearing loss. After pure-tone testing, if the AC and BC responses at all frequencies 500‚Äì8000 Hz are better than 25 dB HL, meaning 0-24 dB HL, the results are considered normal hearing sensitivity. If the AC and BC are worse than 25 dB HL at any one or more frequency between 500‚Äì8000 Hz, meaning 25+, and there is a no bigger difference between AC and BC beyond 10 dB at any frequency, there is a sensori-neural hearing loss present. If the BC responses are normal, 0-24 dB HL, and the AC are worse than 25 dB HL, as well as a 10 dB gap between the air and bone responses, a conductive hearing loss is present. {updated March 2019} The modified Hughson‚ÄìWestlake method is used by many audiologists during testing. A battery of (1) otoscopy, to view the ear canal and tympanic membrane, (2) tympanometry, to assess the immittance of the tympanic membrane and how well it moves, (3) otoacoustic emissions, to measure the response of the outer hair cells located in the cochlea, (4) audiobooth pure-tone testing, to obtain thresholds to determine the type, severity, and pathology of the hearing loss present, and (5) speech tests, to measure the patients recognition and ability to repeat the speech heard, is all taken into consideration when diagnosing the pathology of the patient. History =Etymology= Some older texts call the nerve the acoustic or auditory nerve, but these terms have fallen out of widespread use because they fail to recognize the nerve's role in the vestibular system. Vestibulocochlear nerve is therefore preferred by most.

It exits the brainstem out from the sides of the upper medulla, just anterior (closer to the nose) to the vagus nerve. The motor division of the glossopharyngeal nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata, while the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest. Structure From the anterior portion of the medulla oblongata, the glossopharyngeal nerve passes laterally across or below the flocculus, and leaves the skull through the central part of the jugular foramen. From the superior and inferior ganglia in jugular foramen, it has its own sheath of dura mater. The inferior ganglion on the inferior surface of petrous part of temporal is related with a triangular depression into which the aqueduct of cochlea opens. On the inferior side, the glossopharyngeal nerve is lateral and anterior to the vagus nerve and accessory nerve. In its passage through the foramen (with X and XI), the glossopharyngeal nerve passes between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. It descends in front of the latter vessel and beneath the styloid process and the muscles connected with it, to the lower border of the stylopharyngeus. It then curves forward, forming an arch on the side of the neck and lying upon the stylopharyngeus and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle. From there, it passes under cover of the hyoglossus muscle and is finally distributed to the palatine tonsil, the mucous membrane of the fauces and base of the tongue, and the serous glands of the mouth. = Branches = * Tympanic * Stylopharyngeal * Tonsillar *carotid sinus nerve * Branches to the posterior third of tongue * Lingual branches * A communicating branch to the Vagus nerve Note: The glossopharyngeal nerve contributes in the formation of the pharyngeal plexus along with the vagus nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve has five distinct general functions: #Branchial motor (special visceral efferent)supplies the stylopharyngeus muscle. #Visceral motor (general visceral efferent)provides parasympathetic innervation of the parotid gland via the otic ganglion #Visceral sensory (general visceral afferent)carries visceral sensory information from the carotid sinus and carotid body. #General sensory (general somatic afferent)provides general sensory information from inner surface of the tympanic membrane, upper pharynx (GVA), and the posterior one-third of the tongue. #Visceral afferent (special visceral afferent)provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, including circumvallate papillae. The glossopharyngeal nerve as noted above is a mixed nerve consisting of both sensory and motor nerve fibers. The sensory fibers' origin include the pharynx, middle ear, posterior one-third of the tongue (including taste buds); and the carotid body and sinus. These fibers terminate at the medulla oblongata. The motor fibers' origin is the medulla oblongata, and they terminate at the parotid salivary gland, the glands of the posterior tongue, and the stylopharyngeus muscle (which dilates the pharynx during swallowing). =Overview of branchial motor component= The branchial motor component of CN IX provides voluntary control of the stylopharyngeus muscle, which elevates the pharynx during swallowing and speech. Origin and central course The branchial motor component originates from the nucleus ambiguus in the reticular formation of the medulla Rostral medulla. Fibers leaving the nucleus ambiguus travel anteriorly and laterally to exit the medulla, along with the other components of CN IX, between the olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Intracranial course Upon emerging from the lateral aspect of the medulla the branchial motor component joins the other components of CN IX to exit the skull via the jugular foramen. The glossopharyngeal fibers travel just anterior to the cranial nerves X and XI, which also exit the skull via the jugular foramen. Extra-cranial course and final innervation Upon exiting the skull the branchial motor fibers descend deep to the temporal styloid process and wrap around the posterior border of the stylopharyngeus muscle before innervating it. Voluntary control of the stylopharyngeus muscle Signals for the voluntary movement of stylopharyngeus muscle originate in the pre- motor and motor cortex (in association with other cortical areas) and pass via the corticobulbar tract in the genu of the internal capsule to synapse bilaterally on the ambiguus nuclei in the medulla. =Overview of visceral motor component= Parasympathetic component of the glossopharyngeal nerve that innervates the ipsilateral parotid gland. Origin and central course The preganglionic nerve fibers originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus of the rostral medulla and travel anteriorly and laterally to exit the brainstem between the medullary olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle with the other components of CN IX. Note: These neurons do not form a distinct nucleus visible on cross-section of the brainstem. The position indicated on the diagram is representative of the location of the cell bodies of these fibers. Intracranial course Upon emerging from the lateral aspect of the medulla, the visceral motor fibers join the other components of CN IX to enter the jugular foramen. Within the jugular foramen, there are two glossopharyngeal ganglia that contain nerve cell bodies that mediate general, visceral, and special sensation. The visceral motor fibers pass through both ganglia without synapsing and exit the inferior ganglion with CN IX general sensory fibers as the tympanic nerve. Before exiting the jugular foramen, the tympanic nerve enters the petrous portion of the temporal bone and ascends via the inferior tympanic canaliculus to the tympanic cavity. Within the tympanic cavity the tympanic nerve forms a plexus on the surface of the promontory of the middle ear to provide general sensation. The visceral motor fibers pass through this plexus and merge to become the lesser petrosal nerve. The lesser petrosal nerve re-enters and travels through the temporal bone to emerge in the middle cranial fossa just lateral to the greater petrosal nerve. It then proceeds anteriorly to exit the skull via the foramen ovale along with the mandibular nerve component of CN V (V3). Extra-cranial course and final innervations Upon exiting the skull, the lesser petrosal nerve synapses in the otic ganglion, which is suspended from the mandibular nerve immediately below the foramen ovale. Postganglionic fibers from the otic ganglion travel with the auriculotemporal branch of CN V3 to enter the substance of the parotid gland. Hypothalamic Influence Fibers from the hypothalamus and olfactory system project via the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus to influence the output of the inferior salivatory nucleus. Examples include: 1) dry mouth in response to fear (mediated by the hypothalamus); 2) salivation in response to smelling food (mediated by the olfactory system) =Overview of visceral sensory component= This component of CN IX innervates the baroreceptors of the carotid sinus and chemoreceptors of the carotid body. ;Peripheral and intracranial course. :Sensory fibers arise from the carotid sinus and carotid body at the common carotid artery bifurcation, ascend in the carotid sinus nerve, and join the other components of CN IX at the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion. The cell bodies of these neurons reside in the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion. The central processes of these neurons enter the skull via the jugular foramen. ;Central course ‚Äì visceral sensory component :Once inside the skull, the visceral sensory fibers enter the lateral medulla between the olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle and descend in the solitary tract to synapse in the caudal solitary nucleus. From the solitary nucleus, connections are made with several areas in the reticular formation and hypothalamus to mediate cardiovascular and respiratory reflex responses to changes in blood pressure, and serum concentrations of CO2 and O2. Clinical correlation The visceral sensory fibers of CN IX mediate the afferent limb of the pharyngeal reflex in which touching the back of the pharynx stimulates the patient to gag (i.e., the gag reflex). The efferent signal to the musculature of the pharynx is carried by the branchial motor fibers of the vagus nerve. =Overview of somatic sensory component= This component of CN IX carries general sensory information (pain, temperature, and touch) from the skin of the external ear, internal surface of the tympanic membrane, the walls of the upper pharynx, and the posterior one-third of the tongue, anterior surface of the epiglottis, vallecula. ;Peripheral course :Sensory fibers from the skin of the external ear initially travel with the auricular branch of CN X, while those from the middle ear travel in the tympanic nerve as discussed above (CN IX visceral motor section). General sensory information from the upper pharynx and posterior one-third of the tongue travel via the pharyngeal branches of CN IX. These peripheral processes have their cell body in either the superior or inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion. ;Central course :The central processes of the general sensory neurons exit the glossopharyngeal ganglia and pass through the jugular foramen to enter the brainstem at the level of the medulla. Upon entering the medulla these fibers descend in the spinal trigeminal tract and synapse in the caudal spinal nucleus of the trigeminal. =Overview of special sensory component= The special sensory component of CN IX provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue. ;Peripheral course :Special sensory fibers from the posterior one-third of the tongue travel via the pharyngeal branches of CN IX to the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion where their cell bodies reside. ;Central course ‚Äì special sensory component :The central processes of these neurons exit the inferior ganglion and pass through the jugular foramen to enter the brainstem at the level of the rostral medulla between the olive and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Upon entering the medulla, these fibers ascend in the tractus solitarius and synapse in the gustatory part of nucleus solitarius. Taste fibers from CN VII and X also ascend and synapse here. Ascending secondary neurons originating in nucleus solitarius project bilaterally to the ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei of the thalamus via the central tegmental tract. Tertiary neurons from the thalamus project via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the inferior one-third of the primary sensory cortex (the gustatory cortex of the parietal lobe). =Associated brainstem nuclei= * Solitary nucleus: taste from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue and information from carotid sinus baroreceptors and carotid body chemoreceptors * Spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve: Somatic sensory fibers from the internal surface of the tympanic membrane, middle ear, upper part of the pharynx, soft palate and posterior 1/3 of the tongue * Nucleus ambiguus: lower motor neurons for the stylopharyngeus muscle * Inferior salivatory nucleus: preganglionic parasympathetic neurons to the otic ganglion and then to the parotid gland Functions * It receives general somatic sensory fibers (ventral trigeminothalamic tract) from the tonsils, the pharynx, the middle ear and the posterior 1/3 of the tongue. * It receives special visceral sensory fibers (taste) from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue. * It receives visceral sensory fibers from the carotid bodies, carotid sinus.Atlas of Human Anatomy, 5th Ed, Netter * It supplies parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland via the otic ganglion. * It supplies motor fibers to stylopharyngeus muscle, the only motor component of this cranial nerve. * It contributes to the pharyngeal plexus. Clinical significance =Damage= Damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in loss of taste sensation to the posterior one third of the tongue, and impaired swallowing. =Examination= The clinical tests used to determine if the glossopharyngeal nerve has been damaged include testing the gag reflex of the mouth, asking the patient to swallow or cough, and evaluating for speech impediments. The clinician may also test the posterior one-third of the tongue with bitter and sour substances to evaluate for impairment of taste. The integrity of the glossopharyngeal nerve may be evaluated by testing the patient's general sensation and that of taste on the posterior third of the tongue. The gag reflex can also be used to evaluate the glossphyaryngeal nerve.

It is considered as the eleventh of twelve pairs of cranial nerves, or simply cranial nerve XI, as part of it was formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder. Traditional descriptions of the accessory nerve divide it into a spinal part and a cranial part. The cranial component rapidly joins the vagus nerve, and there is ongoing debate about whether the cranial part should be considered part of the accessory nerve proper. Consequently, the term \\"accessory nerve\\" usually refers only to nerve supplying the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, also called the spinal accessory nerve. Strength testing of these muscles can be measured during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result from a variety of causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation. The accessory nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic spinal segments C1‚ÄìC6. Structure The fibres of the spinal accessory nerve originate solely in neurons situated in the upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, to the level of about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord. After leaving the skull, the cranial component detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around the level of the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part. =Nucleus= The fibres that form the spinal accessory nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, is located in the lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived. = Variation = In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around the level of the posterior belly of digastric muscle, in front of the vein in about 80% of people, and behind it in about 20%, and in one reported case, piercing the vein. Traditionally, the accessory nerve is described as having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that in the majority of individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject. =Development= The accessory nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic spinal segments C1‚ÄìC6. Function sternocleidomastoid and trapezius musclesalt=Image showing the head with two muscles highlighted. The spinal component of the accessory nerve provides motor control of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The trapezius muscle controls the action of shrugging the shoulders, and the sternocleidomastoid the action of turning the head. Like most muscles, control of the trapezius muscle arises from the opposite side of the brain. Contraction of the upper part of the trapezius muscle elevates the scapula. The nerve fibres sternocleidomastoid however are thought to change sides () twice. This means that the sternocleidomastoid is controlled by the brain on the same side of the body. Contraction of the stenocleidomastoid fibres turns the head to the opposite side, the net effect meaning that the head is turned to the side of the brain receiving visual information from that area. The cranial component of the accessory nerve, on the other hand, provides motor control to the muscles of the soft palate, larynx and pharynx. =Classification= Among investigators there is disagreement regarding the terminology used to describe the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components. Clinical significance =Examination= The accessory nerve is tested by evaluating the function of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance. One-sided weakness of the trapezius may indicate injury to the nerve on the same side of an injury to the spinal accessory nerve on the same side () of the body being assessed. Weakness in head-turning suggests injury to the contralateral spinal accessory nerve: a weak leftward turn is indicative of a weak right sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus right spinal accessory nerve injury), while a weak rightward turn is indicative of a weak left sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus left spinal accessory nerve). Hence, weakness of shrug on one side and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve on the side of the shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome or poliomyelitis. = Injury = Injury to the spinal accessory nerve commonly occurs during neck surgery, including neck dissection and lymph node excision. It can also occur as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma, and in some causes spontaneously. Damage at any point along the nerve's course will affect the function of the nerve. The nerve is intentionally removed in \\"radical\\" neck dissections, which are attempts at exploring the neck surgically for the presence and extent of cancer. Attempts are made to spare it in other forms of less aggressive dissection. Injury to the accessory nerve can result in neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies may be needed to confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups. Damage to the nerve can cause torticollis. History English anatomist Thomas Willis in 1664 first described the accessory nerve, choosing to use \\"accessory\\" (described in Latin as nervus accessorius) meaning in association with the vagus nerve. In 1848, Jones Quain described the nerve as the \\"spinal nerve accessory to the vagus\\", recognizing that while a minor component of the nerve joins with the larger vagus nerve, the majority of accessory nerve fibres originate in the spinal cord. In 1893 it was recognised that the heretofore named nerve fibres \\"accessory\\" to the vagus originated from the same nucleus in the medulla oblongata, and it came to pass that these fibres were increasingly viewed as part of the vagus nerve itself. Consequently, the term \\"accessory nerve\\" was and is increasingly used to denote only fibres from the spinal cord; the fact that only the spinal portion could be tested clinically lent weight to this opinion.

It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the medulla as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. The nerve is involved in controlling tongue movements required for speech and swallowing, including sticking out the tongue and moving it from side to side. Damage to the nerve or the neural pathways which control it can affect the ability of the tongue to move and its appearance, with the most common sources of damage being injury from trauma or surgery, and motor neuron disease. The first recorded description of the nerve is by Herophilos in the third century BC. The name hypoglossus springs from the fact that its passage is below the tongue, from hypo () and glossa (). Structure The hypoglossal nerve arises as a number of small rootlets from the front of the medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the anterolateral sulcus which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull. After emerging from the hypoglossal canal, the hypoglossal nerve gives off a meningeal branch and picks up a branch from the anterior ramus of C1. It then travels close to the vagus nerve and spinal division of the accessory nerve, spirals downwards behind the vagus nerve and passes between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein lying on the carotid sheath. At a point at the level of the angle of the mandible, the hypoglossal nerve emerges from behind the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It then loops around a branch of the occipital artery and travels forward into the region beneath the mandible. The hypoglossal nerve moves forward lateral to the hyoglossus and medial to the stylohyoid muscles and lingual nerve. It continues deep to the genioglossus muscle and continues forward to the tip of the tongue. It distributes branches to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscle of the tongue innervates as it passes in this direction, and supplies several muscles (hyoglossus, genioglossus and styloglossus) that it passes. The rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve arise from the hypoglossal nucleus near the bottom of the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. File:Human brainstem anterior view description.JPGThe hypoglossal nerve emerges as several rootlets (labelled here as number 12) from the olives of the medulla (labelled 13), part of the brainstem. File:Base of skull 19.jpgThe hypoglossal nerve leaves the skull through the hypoglossal canal, which is situated near the large opening for the spinal cord, the foramen magnum. File:Sobo 1909 693.pngAfter leaving the skull, the hypoglossal nerve spirals around the vagus nerve and then passes behind the deep belly of the digastric muscle. File:Slide12ww.JPGThe hypoglossal nerve then travels deep to the hyoglossus muscle, which it supplies. It then continues on and supplies the genioglossus muscle, and towards the tip of the tongue, where it divides into branches supplying the tongue muscles. =Development= The hypoglossal nerve is derived from the first pair of occipital somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The musculature it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week. The hypoglossal nucleus is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata. Function Schematic image of the hypoglossal nerve and innervation targets. The hypoglossal nerve provides motor control of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue: genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. These represent all muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle. The hypoglossal nerve is of a general somatic efferent (GSE) type. These muscles are involved in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to the underside of the top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation. Clinical significance =Damage= Reports of damage to the hypoglossal nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage to the left and right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing. Progressive bulbar palsy, a form of motor neuron disease, is associated with combined lesions of the hypoglossal nucleus and nucleus ambiguus with wasting (atrophy) of the motor nerves of the pons and medulla. This may cause difficulty with tongue movements, speech, chewing and swallowing caused by dysfunction of several cranial nerve nuclei. Motor neuron disease is the most common disease affecting the hypoglossal nerve. =Examination= waste away and the tongue will not be able to stick out straight. The injury here occurred because of branchial cyst surgery. alt=Image of a tongue protruding from a mouth, wasted on the left, and pointing to the left. The hypoglossal nerve is tested by examining the tongue and its movements. At rest, if the nerve is injured a tongue may appear to have the appearance of a \\"bag of worms\\" (fasciculations) or wasting (atrophy). The nerve is then tested by sticking the tongue out. If there is damage to the nerve or its pathways, the tongue will usually but not always deviate to one side. When the nerve is damaged, the tongue may feel \\"thick,\\" \\"heavy,\\" or \\"clumsy.\\" Weakness of tongue muscles can result in slurred speech, affecting sounds particularly dependent on the tongue for generation (i.e., lateral approximants, dental stops, alveolar stops, velar nasals, rhotic consonants etc.). Tongue strength may be tested by poking the tongue against the inside of their cheek, while an examiner feels or presses from the cheek. The hypoglossal nerve carries lower motor neurons that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage will depend on the position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side which action is to deviate the tongue in the contralateral side . If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle. =Use in nerve repair= The hypoglossal nerve may be connected (anastamosed) to the facial nerve to attempt to restore function when the facial nerve is damaged. Attempts at repair by either wholly or partially connecting nerve fibres from the hypoglossal nerve to the facial nerve may be used when there is focal facial nerve damage (for example, from trauma or cancer). History The first recorded description of the hypoglossal nerve was by Herophilos (335‚Äì280 BC), although it was not named at the time. The first use of the name hypoglossal in Latin as nervi hypoglossi externa was used by Winslow in 1733. This was followed though by several different namings including nervi indeterminati, par lingual, par gustatorium, great sub-lingual by different authors, and gustatory nerve and lingual nerve (by Winslow). It was listed in 1778 as nerve hypoglossum magnum by Soemmering. It was then named as the great hypoglossal nerve by Cuvier in 1800 as a translation of Winslow and finally named in English by Knox in 1832.  Other animals  The hypoglossal nerve is one of twelve cranial nerves found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, and then to the affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the nerve in rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution. The size of the hypoglossal nerve, as measured by the size of the hypoglossal canal, has been hypothesised to be associated with the progress of evolution of primates, with reasoning that larger nerves would be associated with improvements in speech associated with evolutionary changes. This hypothesis has been refuted.

It is named after George Green, but its first proof is due to Bernhard Riemann,George Green, An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism (Nottingham, England: T. Wheelhouse, 1828). Green did not actually derive the form of \\"Green's theorem\\" which appears in this article; rather, he derived a form of the \\"divergence theorem\\", which appears on pages 10‚Äì12 of his Essay. In 1846, the form of \\"Green's theorem\\" which appears in this article was first published, without proof, in an article by Augustin Cauchy: A. Cauchy (1846) \\"Sur les int√©grales qui s'√©tendent √† tous les points d'une courbe ferm√©e\\" (On integrals that extend over all of the points of a closed curve), Comptes rendus, 23: 251‚Äì255. (The equation appears at the bottom of page 254, where (S) denotes the line integral of a function k along the curve s that encloses the area S.) A proof of the theorem was finally provided in 1851 by Bernhard Riemann in his inaugural dissertation: Bernhard Riemann (1851) f√ºr eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer ver√§nderlichen complexen Gr√∂sse (Basis for a general theory of functions of a variable complex quantity), (G√∂ttingen, (Germany): Adalbert Rente, 1867); see pages 8‚Äì9. and it is the two-dimensional special case of the more general Kelvin‚ÄìStokes theorem. Theorem Let C be a positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed curve in a plane, and let D be the region bounded by C. If L and M are functions of (x, y) defined on an open region containing D and having continuous partial derivatives there, then : where the path of integration along C is anticlockwise. In physics, Green's theorem finds many applications. One is solving two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflowing from a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In plane geometry, and in particular, area surveying, Green's theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter. Proof when D is a simple region If D is a simple type I region with its boundary consisting of the curves C1, C2, C3, C4, half of Green's theorem can be demonstrated. The following is a proof of half of the theorem for the simplified area D, a type I region where C1 and C3 are curves connected by vertical lines (possibly of zero length). A similar proof exists for the other half of the theorem when D is a type II region where C2 and C4 are curves connected by horizontal lines (again, possibly of zero length). Putting these two parts together, the theorem is thus proven for regions of type III (defined as regions which are both type I and type II). The general case can then be deduced from this special case by decomposing D into a set of type III regions. If it can be shown that if :\\\\oint_{C} L\\\\, dx = \\\\iint_{D} \\\\left(- \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)\\\\, dA\\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(1)} and :\\\\oint_{C} M\\\\, dy = \\\\iint_{D} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)\\\\, dA\\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(2)} are true, then Green's theorem follows immediately for the region D. We can prove (1) easily for regions of type I, and (2) for regions of type II. Green's theorem then follows for regions of type III. Assume region D is a type I region and can thus be characterized, as pictured on the right, by :D = \\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\mid a\\\\le x\\\\le b, g_1(x) \\\\le y \\\\le g_2(x)\\\\\\\\} where g1 and g2 are continuous functions on [a, b]. Compute the double integral in (1): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\iint_D \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y}\\\\, dA & =\\\\int_a^b\\\\,\\\\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y} (x,y)\\\\,dy\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_a^b \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{L(x,g_2(x)) - L(x,g_1(x)) \\\\Big\\\\\\\\} \\\\, dx.\\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(3)} \\\\end{align} Now compute the line integral in (1). C can be rewritten as the union of four curves: C1, C2, C3, C4. With C1, use the parametric equations: x = x, y = g1(x), a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b. Then :\\\\int_{C_1} L(x,y)\\\\, dx = \\\\int_a^b L(x,g_1(x))\\\\, dx. With C3, use the parametric equations: x = x, y = g2(x), a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b. Then : \\\\int_{C_3} L(x,y)\\\\, dx = -\\\\int_{-C_3} L(x,y)\\\\, dx = - \\\\int_a^b L(x,g_2(x))\\\\, dx. The integral over C3 is negated because it goes in the negative direction from b to a, as C is oriented positively (anticlockwise). On C2 and C4, x remains constant, meaning : \\\\int_{C_4} L(x,y)\\\\, dx = \\\\int_{C_2} L(x,y)\\\\, dx = 0. Therefore, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{C} L\\\\, dx & = \\\\int_{C_1} L(x,y)\\\\, dx + \\\\int_{C_2} L(x,y)\\\\, dx + \\\\int_{C_3} L(x,y)\\\\, dx + \\\\int_{C_4} L(x,y)\\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\int_a^b L(x,g_1(x))\\\\, dx - \\\\int_a^b L(x,g_2(x))\\\\, dx .\\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(4)} \\\\end{align} Combining (3) with (4), we get (1) for regions of type I. A similar treatment yields (2) for regions of type II. Putting the two together, we get the result for regions of type III.  Proof for rectifiable Jordan curves  We are going to prove the following Theorem. Let \\\\Gamma be a rectifiable, positively oriented Jordan curve in \\\\mathbf{R}^{2} and let R denote its inner region. Suppose that A, B:\\\\overline{R}\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{R} are continuous functions with the property that A has second partial derivative at every point of R, B has first partial derivative at every point of R and that the functions D_{1}B, D_{2}A:R\\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbf{R} are Riemann-integrable over R. Then \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma}A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy=\\\\int_{R}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\left(D_{1}B(x,y)-D_{2}A(x,y)\\\\right)\\\\,d(x,y). We need the following lemmas whose proofs can be found in : Lemma 1 (Decomposition Lemma). Assume \\\\Gamma is a rectifiable, positively oriented Jordan curve in the plane and let R be its inner region. For every positive real \\\\delta, let \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\delta) denote the collection of squares in the plane bounded by the lines x=m\\\\delta, y=m\\\\delta, where m runs through the set of integers. Then, for this \\\\delta, there exists a decomposition of \\\\overline{R} into a finite number of non-overlapping subregions in such a manner that (i) Each one of the subregions contained in R, say R_{1}, R_2,\\\\ldots, R_{k}, is a square from \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\delta). (ii) Each one of the remaining subregions, say R_{k+1},\\\\ldots,R_s, has as boundary a rectifiable Jordan curve formed by a finite number of arcs of \\\\Gamma and parts of the sides of some square from \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\delta). (iii) Each one of the border regions R_{k+1},\\\\ldots,R_s can be enclosed in a square of edge-length 2\\\\delta. (iv) If \\\\Gamma_i is the positively oriented boundary curve of R_i, then \\\\Gamma=\\\\Gamma_1+\\\\Gamma_2+\\\\cdots+\\\\Gamma_s. (v) The number s-k of border regions is no greater than 4\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda}{\\\\delta} + 1\\\\right), where \\\\Lambda is the length of \\\\Gamma. Lemma 2. Let \\\\Gamma be a rectifiable curve in the plane and let \\\\Delta_\\\\Gamma(h) be the set of points in the plane whose distance from (the range of) \\\\Gamma is at most h. The outer Jordan content of this set satisfies \\\\overline{c}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\Delta_\\\\Gamma(h)\\\\le2h\\\\Lambda +\\\\pi h^2. Lemma 3. Let \\\\Gamma be a rectifiable curve in \\\\mathbf{R}^{2} and let f:\\\\text{range of }\\\\Gamma\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{R} be a continuous function. Then : \\\\left\\\\vert\\\\int_\\\\Gamma f(x,y)\\\\,dy\\\\right\\\\vert and : \\\\left\\\\vert\\\\int_\\\\Gamma f(x,y)\\\\,dx\\\\right\\\\vert are \\\\le\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Lambda\\\\Omega_f,where \\\\Omega_f is the oscillation of f on the range of \\\\Gamma. Now we are in position to prove the Theorem: Proof of Theorem. Let \\\\varepsilon be an arbitrary positive real number. By continuity of A, B and compactness of \\\\overline{R}, given \\\\varepsilon>0, there exists 0<\\\\delta<1 such that whenever two points of \\\\overline{R} are less than 2\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,\\\\delta apart, their images under A, B are less than \\\\varepsilon apart. For this \\\\delta, consider the decomposition given by the previous Lemma. We have : \\\\int_\\\\Gamma A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i} A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy\\\\quad +\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^s \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i}A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy. Put \\\\varphi:=D_1 B-D_2 A. For each i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,k\\\\\\\\}, the curve \\\\Gamma_i is a positively oriented square, for which Green's formula holds. Hence : \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i}A\\\\,dx + B\\\\,dy =\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\int_{R_i} \\\\,\\\\, \\\\varphi = \\\\int_{\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k R_i}\\\\,\\\\varphi. Every point of a border region is at a distance no greater than 2\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,\\\\delta from \\\\Gamma. Thus, if K is the union of all border regions, then K\\\\subset \\\\Delta_{\\\\Gamma}(2\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,\\\\delta); hence c(K)\\\\le\\\\overline{c}\\\\,\\\\Delta_{\\\\Gamma}(2\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,\\\\delta)\\\\le 4\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,\\\\delta+8\\\\pi\\\\delta^2, by Lemma 2. Notice that : \\\\int_R \\\\varphi\\\\,\\\\,-\\\\int_{\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^k R_i} \\\\varphi=\\\\int_K \\\\varphi. This yields : \\\\left\\\\vert\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i} A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy\\\\quad-\\\\int_R\\\\varphi \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\le M \\\\delta(1+\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,\\\\delta) \\\\text{ for some } M>0. We may as well choose \\\\delta so that the RHS of the last inequality is <\\\\varepsilon. The remark in the beginning of this proof implies that the oscillations of A and B on every border region is at most \\\\varepsilon. We have : \\\\left\\\\vert\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^s \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i}A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy\\\\right\\\\vert\\\\le\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^s \\\\Lambda_i. By Lemma 1(iii), : \\\\sum_{i=k+1}^s \\\\Lambda_i \\\\le\\\\Lambda + (4\\\\delta)\\\\,4\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda}{\\\\delta}+1\\\\right)\\\\le17\\\\Lambda+16. Combining these, we finally get : \\\\left\\\\vert\\\\int_\\\\Gamma A\\\\,dx+B\\\\,dy\\\\quad-\\\\int_R \\\\varphi\\\\right\\\\vert< C \\\\varepsilon, for some C>0. Since this is true for every \\\\varepsilon>0, we are done.  Validity under different hypotheses  The hypothesis of the last theorem are not the only ones under which Green's formula is true. Another common set of conditions is the following: The functions A, B:\\\\overline{R}\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{R} are still assumed to be continuous. However, we now require them to be Fr√©chet-differentiable at every point of R. This implies the existence of all directional derivatives, in particular D_{e_i}A=:D_i A, D_{e_i}B=:D_i B, \\\\,i=1,2, where, as usual, (e_1,e_2) is the canonical ordered basis of \\\\mathbf{R}^2. In addition, we require the function D_1 B-D_2 A to be Riemann-integrable over R. As a corollary of this, we get the Cauchy Integral Theorem for rectifiable Jordan curves: Theorem (Cauchy). If \\\\Gamma is a rectifiable Jordan curve in \\\\mathbf{C} and if f:\\\\text{closure of inner region of } \\\\Gamma \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbf{C} is a continuous mapping holomorphic throughout the inner region of \\\\Gamma, then : \\\\int_\\\\Gamma f=0, the integral being a complex contour integral. Proof. We regard the complex plane as \\\\mathbf{R}^{2}. Now, define u,v:\\\\overline{R}\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{R} to be such that f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y). These functions are clearly continuous. It is well known that u and v are Fr√©chet-differentiable and that they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: D_1 v+D_2 u=D_1 u-D_2 v =\\\\text{zero function}. Now, analysing the sums used to define the complex contour integral in question, it is easy to realize that : \\\\int_\\\\Gamma f=\\\\int_\\\\Gamma u\\\\,dx-v\\\\,dy\\\\quad+i\\\\int_\\\\Gamma v\\\\,dx+u\\\\,dy, the integrals on the RHS being usual line integrals. These remarks allow us to apply Green's Theorem to each one of these line integrals, finishing the proof.  Multiply-connected regions  Theorem. Let \\\\Gamma_0,\\\\Gamma_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Gamma_n be positively oriented rectifiable Jordan curves in \\\\mathbf{R}^{2} satisfying : \\\\begin{aligned} \\\\Gamma_i \\\\subset R_0,&&\\\\text{if } 1\\\\le i\\\\le n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Gamma_i \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{R}^2\\\\smallsetminus \\\\overline{R}_j,&&\\\\text{if }1\\\\le i,j \\\\le n\\\\text{ and }i e j, \\\\end{aligned} where R_i is the inner region of \\\\Gamma_i. Let : D=R_0 \\\\smallsetminus (\\\\overline{R}_1 \\\\cup \\\\overline{R}_2 \\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup \\\\overline{R}_n). Suppose p:\\\\overline{D}\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{R} and q:\\\\overline{D}\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{R} are continuous functions whose restriction to D is Fr√©chet-differentiable. If the function : (x,y)\\\\longmapsto\\\\frac{\\\\partial q}{\\\\partial e_1}(x,y)-\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial e_2}(x,y) is Riemann-integrable over D, then : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_0} p(x,y)\\\\,dx+q(x,y)\\\\,dy-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_i} p(x,y)\\\\,dx + q(x,y)\\\\,dy \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] = {} & \\\\int_D\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\partial q}{\\\\partial e_1}(x,y)-\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial e_2}(x,y)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\, d(x,y). \\\\end{align} Relationship to Stokes' theorem Green's theorem is a special case of the Kelvin‚ÄìStokes theorem, when applied to a region in the xy-plane. We can augment the two-dimensional field into a three-dimensional field with a z component that is always 0. Write F for the vector-valued function \\\\mathbf{F}=(L,M,0). Start with the left side of Green's theorem: :\\\\oint_C (L\\\\, dx + M\\\\, dy) = \\\\oint_C (L, M, 0) \\\\cdot (dx, dy, dz) = \\\\oint_C \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r}. The Kelvin‚ÄìStokes theorem: :\\\\oint_C \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\iint_S abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} \\\\, dS. The surface S is just the region in the plane D, with the unit normal \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} defined (by convention) to have a positive z component in order to match the \\"positive orientation\\" definitions for both theorems. The expression inside the integral becomes : abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} = \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial 0}{\\\\partial y} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{i} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial z} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial 0}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{j} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\right] \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{k} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right). Thus we get the right side of Green's theorem :\\\\iint_S abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} \\\\, dS = \\\\iint_D \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right) \\\\, dA. Green's theorem is also a straightforward result of the general Stokes' theorem using differential forms and exterior derivatives: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\oint_C L \\\\,dx + M \\\\,dy = \\\\oint_{\\\\partial D} \\\\omega = \\\\int_D \\\\,d\\\\omega \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] = {} & \\\\int_D \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y} \\\\,dy \\\\wedge \\\\,dx + \\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} \\\\,dx \\\\wedge \\\\,dy = \\\\iint_D \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right) \\\\,dx \\\\,dy. \\\\end{align} Relationship to the divergence theorem Considering only two-dimensional vector fields, Green's theorem is equivalent to the two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem: : where abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F} is the divergence on the two- dimensional vector field \\\\mathbf{F}, and \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} is the outward- pointing unit normal vector on the boundary. To see this, consider the unit normal \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} in the right side of the equation. Since in Green's theorem d\\\\mathbf{r} = (dx, dy) is a vector pointing tangential along the curve, and the curve C is the positively oriented (i.e. anticlockwise) curve along the boundary, an outward normal would be a vector which points 90¬∞ to the right of this; one choice would be (dy, -dx). The length of this vector is \\\\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = ds. So (dy, -dx) = \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}\\\\,ds. Start with the left side of Green's theorem: :\\\\oint_C (L\\\\, dx + M\\\\, dy) = \\\\oint_C (M, -L) \\\\cdot (dy, -dx) = \\\\oint_C (M, -L) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}\\\\,ds. Applying the two- dimensional divergence theorem with \\\\mathbf{F} = (M, -L), we get the right side of Green's theorem: :\\\\oint_C (M, -L) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}\\\\,ds = \\\\iint_D\\\\left( abla \\\\cdot (M, -L) \\\\right) \\\\, dA = \\\\iint_D \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right) \\\\, dA. Area calculation Green's theorem can be used to compute area by line integral. The area of a planar region D is given by :A = \\\\iint_D dA. Choose L and M such that \\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial y} = 1, the area is given by :A = \\\\oint_{C} (L\\\\, dx + M\\\\, dy). Possible formulas for the area of D include :A=\\\\oint_C x\\\\, dy = -\\\\oint_C y\\\\, dx = \\\\tfrac 12 \\\\oint_C (-y\\\\, dx + x\\\\, dy).

M. Ferrers. The website for this is given below. The essay introduced several important concepts, among them a theorem similar to the modern Green's theorem, the idea of potential functions as currently used in physics, and the concept of what are now called Green's functions. Green was the first person to create a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism and his theory formed the foundation for the work of other scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson, and others. His work on potential theory ran parallel to that of Carl Friedrich Gauss. Green's life story is remarkable in that he was almost entirely self-taught. He received only about one year of formal schooling as a child, between the ages of 8 and 9.  Early life  Green's Mill in Sneinton, the mill owned by Green's father. The mill was renovated in 1986 and is now a science centre. Green was born and lived for most of his life in the English town of Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, now part of the city of Nottingham. His father, also named George, was a baker who had built and owned a brick windmill used to grind grain. In his youth, Green was described as having a frail constitution and a dislike for doing work in his father's bakery. He had no choice in the matter, however, and as was common for the time he likely began working daily to earn his living at the age of five. = Robert Goodacre's Academy = During this era it was common for only 25‚Äì50% of children in Nottingham to receive any schooling. The majority of schools were Sunday schools, run by the Church, and children would typically attend for one or two years only. Recognizing the young Green's above average intellect, and being in a strong financial situation due to his successful bakery, his father enrolled him in March 1801 at Robert Goodacre's Academy in Upper Parliament Street. Robert Goodacre was a well-known science populariser and educator of the time. He published Essay on the Education of Youth, in which he wrote that he did not \\"study the interest of the boy but the embryo Man\\". To a non- specialist, he would have seemed deeply knowledgeable in science and mathematics, but a close inspection of his essay and curriculum revealed that the extent of his mathematical teachings was limited to algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. Thus, Green's later mathematical contributions, which exhibited knowledge of very modern developments in mathematics, could not have resulted from his tenure at the Robert Goodacre Academy. He stayed for only four terms (one school year), and it was speculated by his contemporaries that he had exhausted all they had to teach him. = Move from Nottingham to Sneinton = In 1773 George's father moved to Nottingham, which at the time had a reputation for being a pleasant town with open spaces and wide roads. By 1831, however, the population had increased nearly five times, in part due to the budding industrial revolution, and the city became known as one of the worst slums in England. There were frequent riots by starving workers, often associated with special hostility towards bakers and millers on the suspicion that they were hiding grain to drive up food prices. For these reasons, in 1807, George Green senior bought a plot of land in Sneinton. On this plot of land he built a \\"brick wind corn mill\\", now referred to as Green's Windmill. It was technologically impressive for its time, but required nearly twenty- four-hour maintenance, which was to become George Green's burden for the next twenty years.  Adult life  = Miller = Just as with baking, Green found the responsibilities of operating the mill annoying and tedious. Grain from the fields was arriving continuously at the mill's doorstep, and the sails of the windmill had to be constantly adjusted to the windspeed, both to prevent damage in high winds, and to maximise rotational speed in low winds. The millstones that would continuously grind against each other, could wear down or cause a fire if they ran out of grain to grind. Every month the stones, which weighed over a ton, would have to be replaced or repaired. = Family life = In 1823 Green formed a relationship with Jane Smith, the daughter of William Smith, hired by Green Senior as mill manager. Although Green and Jane Smith never married, Jane eventually became known as Jane Green and the couple had seven children together; all but the first had Green as a baptismal name. The youngest child was born 13 months before Green's death. Green provided for his common-law wife and children in his will. = Nottingham Subscription Library = When Green was thirty, he became a member of the Nottingham Subscription Library. This library exists today, and was likely one of the only sources of Green's advanced mathematical knowledge. Unlike more conventional libraries, the subscription library was exclusive to a hundred or so subscribers, and the first on the list of subscribers was the Duke of Newcastle. This library catered to requests for specialised books and journals that satisfied the particular interests of their subscribers. = 1828 essay = The title page to Green's original essay on what is now known as Green's theorem. In 1828, Green published An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism, which is the essay he is most famous for today. It was published privately at the author's expense, because he thought it would be presumptuous for a person like himself, with no formal education in mathematics, to submit the paper to an established journal. When Green published his Essay, it was sold on a subscription basis to 51 people, most of whom were friends and probably could not understand it. The wealthy landowner and mathematician Sir Edward Bromhead bought a copy and encouraged Green to do further work in mathematics. Not believing the offer was sincere, Green did not contact Bromhead for two years.  Mathematician  By the time Green's father died in 1829, the senior Green had become one of the gentry due to his considerable accumulated wealth and land owned, roughly half of which he left to his son and the other half to his daughter. The young Green, now thirty-six years old, consequently was able to use this wealth to abandon his miller duties and pursue mathematical studies. = Cambridge = Members of the Nottingham Subscription Library who knew Green repeatedly insisted that he obtain a proper University education. In particular, one of the library's most prestigious subscribers was Sir Edward Bromhead, with whom Green shared many correspondences; he insisted that Green go to Cambridge. In 1832, aged nearly forty, Green was admitted as an undergraduate at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was particularly insecure about his lack of knowledge of Greek and Latin, which were prerequisites, but it turned out not to be as hard for him to learn these as he had envisaged, as the degree of expected mastery was not as high as he had expected. In the mathematics examinations, he won the first-year mathematical prize. He graduated with a BA in 1838 as a 4th Wrangler (the 4th highest scoring student in his graduating class, coming after James Joseph Sylvester who scored 2nd). = College fellow = Following his graduation, Green was elected a fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Even without his stellar academic standing, the Society had already read and made note of his Essay and three other publications, so Green was welcomed. The next two years provided an unparalleled opportunity for Green to read, write, and discuss his scientific ideas. In this short time he published an additional six publications with applications to hydrodynamics, sound, and optics.  Final years and posthumous fame  Green's grave, in the grounds of the church not far from his mill In his final years at Cambridge, Green became rather ill, and in 1840 he returned to Sneinton, only to die a year later. There are rumours that at Cambridge, Green had \\"succumbed to alcohol\\", and some of his earlier supporters, such as Sir Edward Bromhead, tried to distance themselves from him.The grave stone of George Green and Catherine Green parents of George Green Professor of Mathematics at Caius College Cambridge The grave stone of George Green, Professor of Mathematics and Green's Theorem, Caius College Cambridge in St Stephen's cemetery a little closer to the east boundary wall than his parent's grave stone Green's work was not well known in the mathematical community during his lifetime. Besides Green himself, the first mathematician to quote his 1828 work was the Briton Robert Murphy (1806‚Äì1843) in his 1833 work. Green is mentioned in a footnote on p. 357. In 1845, four years after Green's death, Green's work was rediscovered by the young William Thomson (then aged 21), later known as Lord Kelvin, who popularised it for future mathematicians. According to the book \\"George Green\\" by D.M. Cannell, William Thomson noticed Murphy's citation of Green's 1828 essay but found it difficult to locate Green's 1828 work; he finally got some copies of Green's 1828 work from William Hopkins in 1845. In 1871 N. M. Ferrers assembled The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green for publication.N. M. Ferrers editor (1871) The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green, Macmillan Publishers, link from University of Michigan Historical Math Collection Green's work on the motion of waves in a canal (resulting in what is known as Green's law) anticipates the WKB approximation of quantum mechanics, while his research on light-waves and the properties of the Aether produced what is now known as the Cauchy-Green tensor. Green's theorem and functions were important tools in classical mechanics, and were revised by Schwinger's 1948 work on electrodynamics that led to his 1965 Nobel prize (shared with Feynman and Tomonaga). Green's functions later also proved useful in analysing superconductivity. On a visit to Nottingham in 1930, Albert Einstein commented that Green had been 20 years ahead of his time. The theoretical physicist Julian Schwinger who used Green's functions in his ground-breaking works, published a tribute entitled \\"The Greening of Quantum Field Theory: George and I\\" in 1993. The George Green Library at the University of Nottingham is named after him, and houses the majority of the university's science and engineering Collection. The George Green Institute for Electromagnetics Research, a research group in the University of Nottingham engineering department, is also named after him. In 1986, Green's Windmill was restored to working order. It now serves both as a working example of a 19th-century windmill and as a museum and science centre dedicated to Green. Westminster Abbey has a memorial stone for Green in the nave adjoining the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Lord Kelvin.George Green from Westminster Abbey His work and influence on nineteenth century applied physics had been largely forgotten until the publication of his biography by Mary Cannell in 1993.  Source of knowledge  It is unclear to historians exactly where Green obtained information on current developments in mathematics, as Nottingham had little in the way of intellectual resources. What is even more mysterious is that Green had used \\"the Mathematical Analysis,\\" a form of calculus derived from Leibniz that was virtually unheard of, or even actively discouraged, in England at the time (due to Leibniz being a contemporary of Newton who had his own methods that were championed in England). This form of calculus, and the developments of mathematicians such as Laplace, Lacroix and Poisson were not taught even at Cambridge, let alone Nottingham, and yet Green had not only heard of these developments, but also improved upon them. It is speculated that only one person educated in mathematics, John Toplis, headmaster of Nottingham High School 1806‚Äì1819, graduate from Cambridge and an enthusiast of French mathematics, lived in Nottingham at the time.

A sunken courtyard, featuring a sculpture designed by Isamu Noguchi, is in the foreground at left. The Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library () is the rare book library and literary archive of the Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut. Situated on Yale University's Hewitt Quadrangle, the building was designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and completed in 1963. Established by a gift of the Beinecke family and given its own endowment, the library is financially independent from the university and is co-governed by the University Library and Yale Corporation. It is one of the largest buildings in the world entirely dedicated to rare books and manuscripts. The library's iconic building reopened in September 2016 after an 18-month closure for major renovations, which included replacing the building's HVAC system and expanding teaching and exhibition capabilities. Architecture A six-story above-ground glass-enclosed tower of book stacks is encased by a windowless fa√ßade, supported by four monolithic piers at the corners of the building. The exterior shell is structurally supported by a steel frame with pylons embedded to bedrock at each corner pier. The fa√ßade is constructed of translucent veined marble and granite. The marble is milled to a thickness of and was quarried from Danby, Vermont. On a sunny day the marble transmits filtered daylight to the interior in a subtle golden amber glow, a product of its thin profile. These panels are framed by a hexagonal grid of Vermont Woodbury granite veneer, fastened to a structural steel frame. The outside dimensions have \\"Platonic\\" mathematical proportions of 1:2:3 (height: width: length). The building has been called a \\"jewel box\\", and also a \\"laboratory for the humanities\\". The Modernist structure contains furniture designed by Florence Knoll and Marcel Breuer. An elevated public exhibition mezzanine surrounds the glass stack tower, and displays among other things, one of the 48 extant copies of the Gutenberg Bible. Two basement floors extend under much of Hewitt Quadrangle. The first sub-grade level, the \\"Court\\" level, centers on a sunken courtyard in front of the Beinecke, which features The Garden (Pyramid, Sun, and Cube). These are abstract allegorical sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), sun (the disc), and chance (the cube). This level also features a secure reading room for visiting researchers, administrative offices, and book storage areas. The level of the building two floors below ground has movable-aisle high-density shelving for books and archives. The Beinecke is one of the larger buildings in America devoted entirely to rare books and manuscripts. The library has room in the central tower for 180,000 volumes and room for over 1 million volumes in the underground book stacks. The library's collection, which is housed both in the library's main building and at Yale University's Library Shelving Facility in Hamden, Connecticut, totals roughly 1 million volumes and several million manuscripts. During the 1960s, the Claes Oldenburg sculpture Lipstick on Caterpillar Tracks (Ascending) was displayed in Hewitt Quadrangle. The sculpture has since been moved to the courtyard of Morse College, one of the university's residential dormitories. The elegance of the Beinecke later inspired the glass-walled structure that protects and displays the original core collection (the books gifted by King George III and referred to as the King's Library) within the British Library building in Euston, London. History A glass tower displays and protects the rare books In the late 19th century, rare and valuable books of the Library of Yale College were placed on special shelving at the College Library, now known as Dwight Hall. When the university received a multimillion-dollar bequest from John W. Sterling for the construction of Sterling Memorial Library in 1918, the university decided to create a dedicated reading room for its rare books, which became the building's Rare Book Room when the building opened in 1930. Because the bequest did not contain an allowance for books or materials, Yale English professor Chauncey Brewster Tinker petitioned Yale alumni to donate materials that would give the university a collection as monumental as its new building. By the time Sterling opened, Tinker's appeal garnered an impressive collection of rare books, including a Gutenberg Bible from Anna M. Harkness and several major collections from the Beinecke family, most notably its collection on the American West. By 1958, the library owned more than 130,000 rare volumes and many more manuscripts. The amassed collection proved too large for Sterling's reading room, and the reading room unsuited to their preservation. Having already given significant collections to Yale, Edwin and Frederick W. Beinecke‚Äîas well as Johanna Weigle, widow of their brother Walter‚Äîgave funds to build a dedicated rare books library building. When the Beinecke Library opened on October 14, 1963, it became the home of the volumes from Rare Book Room, and three special collections: the Collection of American Literature, the Collection of Western Americana, and the Collection of German Literature. Shortly afterward, they were joined by the James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn Collection. Beinecke Library became the repository for books in the Yale collection printed anywhere before 1800, books printed in Latin America before 1751, books printed in North America before 1821, newspapers and broadsides printed in the United States before 1851, European tracts and pamphlets printed before 1801, and Slavic, East European, Near and Middle Eastern books through the eighteenth century, as well as special books outside these categories. Now, the collection spans through to the present day, including such modern works as limited-edition poetry and artists' books. The library also contains thousands of linear feet of archival material, ranging from ancient papyri and medieval manuscripts to the archived personal papers of modern writers. Special collections Closeup of rare books in the reduced-lighting library tower stacks The two volumes of an original Gutenberg Bible The Voynich manuscript housed at Beinecke Library The library is open to all Yale University students and faculty, and to visiting researchers whose work requires use of its special collections.

In addition to items on permanent display such as the Gutenberg Bible, the Beinecke offers a year-round program of temporary exhibits drawn from its collections. For example, in 2006 the library presented Breaking the Binding: Printing and the Third Dimension, a show of flap books, pop-ups, perspective books, panoramas, and peep-shows in printed form. Display cases are located on the mezzanine level and at the ground floor entry level, and may be freely viewed by the general public whenever the library is open. The Library celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013.Special Events  Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library . Beinecke.library.yale.edu. Retrieved April 12, 2014 There were two full-year exhibitions that explored the library's architecture and people as well as a series of showcases of rarely seen manuscripts, printed works, and visual objects from across all curatorial areas. Security The Beinecke collection does not circulate; all materials are to be consulted in the reading room. The library hosts almost 10,000 research visits annually, almost half of which are with scholars having no formal affiliation to Yale University. Security measures were significantly increased after the well- known antiques dealer Edward Forbes Smiley III was caught cutting maps from rare books with an X-acto blade in 2005. Smiley's scheme was discovered when he dropped his concealed tool in the reading room, and he subsequently served several years in prison for thefts of rare documents valued in millions of dollars from the Beinecke and other libraries. The library operates under a closed stack system, and rigorous security rules now allow carefully controlled access to materials under video surveillance. The glass-enclosed central stacks (not accessible to the public) can be flooded with a mix of Halon 1301 and Inergen fire suppressant gas if fire detectors are triggered. A previous system using carbon dioxide was removed for personnel safety reasons. After an infestation of the death watch beetle was discovered in 1977, the Beinecke Library helped pioneer the non-toxic method of controlling paper- eating pests by freezing books and documents at for three days. All new acquisitions are given this treatment as a precaution, and the deep freeze method is now widely accepted for pest control in special collections libraries.

In physics, the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans Law is an approximation to the spectral radiance of electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength from a black body at a given temperature through classical arguments. For wavelength \\\\lambda, it is: :B_{\\\\lambda} (T) = \\\\frac{2 ck_{\\\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\\\lambda^4}, where B_{\\\\lambda} is the spectral radiance, the power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit wavelength; c is the speed of light; k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} is the Boltzmann constant; and T is the temperature in kelvins. For frequency u, the expression is instead :B_{ u}(T) = \\\\frac{2 u^2 k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} T}{c^2}. The Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law agrees with experimental results at large wavelengths (low frequencies) but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (high frequencies). This inconsistency between observations and the predictions of classical physics is commonly known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. Its resolution in 1900 with the derivation by Max Planck of Planck's law, which gives the correct radiation at all frequencies, was a foundational aspect of the development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century. Historical development In 1900, the British physicist Lord Rayleigh derived the Œª‚àí4 dependence of the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law based on classical physical arguments and empirical facts. A more complete derivation, which included the proportionality constant, was presented by Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans in 1905. The Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law revealed an important error in physics theory of the time. The law predicted an energy output that diverges towards infinity as wavelength approaches zero (as frequency tends to infinity). Measurements of the spectral emission of actual black bodies revealed that the emission agreed with the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law at low frequencies but diverged at high frequencies; reaching a maximum and then falling with frequency, so the total energy emitted is finite. Comparison to Planck's law In 1900 Max Planck empirically obtained an expression for black-body radiation expressed in terms of wavelength (Planck's law): :B_\\\\lambda(T) = \\\\frac{2 h c^2}{\\\\lambda^5}~\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}-1}, where h is the Planck constant and the Boltzmann constant. The Planck's law does not suffer from an ultraviolet catastrophe, and agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance (which ultimately led to quantum theory) was only appreciated several years later. Since, :e^x = 1 + x + {x^2 \\\\over 2!} + {x^3 \\\\over 3!} + \\\\cdots. then in the limit of high temperatures or long wavelengths, the term in the exponential becomes small, and the exponential is well approximated with the Taylor polynomial's first- order term, :e^{\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}. So, :\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}-1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{hc}. This results in Planck's blackbody formula reducing to :B_{\\\\lambda}(T) = \\\\frac{2 ck_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{\\\\lambda^4}, which is identical to the classically derived Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans expression. The same argument can be applied to the blackbody radiation expressed in terms of frequency . In the limit of small frequencies, that is h u \\\\ll k_\\\\mathrm{B} T , :B_ u(T) = \\\\frac{2 h u^3}{c^2}\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{h u}{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2 h u^3}{c^2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{h u} = \\\\frac{2 u^2 k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{c^2}. This last expression is the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law in the limit of small frequencies. Consistency of frequency and wavelength dependent expressions When comparing the frequency and wavelength dependent expressions of the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law it is important to remember that :\\\\frac{dP}{d{\\\\lambda}} = B_{\\\\lambda}(T), and :\\\\frac{dP}{d{ u}} = B_{ u}(T) Therefore, :B_{\\\\lambda}(T) eq B_{ u}(T) even after substituting the value \\\\lambda =c/ u, because B_{\\\\lambda}(T) has units of energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per unit wavelength, whereas B_{ u}(T) has units of energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per unit frequency. To be consistent, we must use the equality :B_{\\\\lambda} \\\\, d\\\\lambda = dP = B_{ u} \\\\, d u where both sides now have units of power (energy emitted per unit time) per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle. Starting with the Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law in terms of wavelength we get :B_{\\\\lambda}(T) = B_{ u}(T) \\\\times \\\\frac{d u}{d\\\\lambda} where :\\\\frac{d u}{d\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\lambda}\\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{c}{\\\\lambda^2}. This leads us to find: :B_{\\\\lambda}(T) = \\\\frac{2k_\\\\mathrm{B} T\\\\left( \\\\frac{c}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^2}{c^2} \\\\times \\\\frac{c}{\\\\lambda^2} = \\\\frac{2ck_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{\\\\lambda^4}. Other forms of Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law Depending on the application, the Planck function can be expressed in 3 different forms. The first involves energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit. In this form, the Planck function and associated Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans limits are given by :B_\\\\lambda(T) = \\\\frac{2 hc^2}{\\\\lambda^5}~\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}-1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2c k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{\\\\lambda^4} or :B_ u(T) = \\\\frac{2h u^3}{c^2}\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{h u}{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2k_\\\\mathrm{B} T u^2}{c^2} Alternatively, Planck's law can be written as an expression I( u,T) = \\\\pi B_ u(T) for emitted power integrated over all solid angles. In this form, the Planck function and associated Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans limits are given by :I(\\\\lambda,T) = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi hc^2}{\\\\lambda^5}~\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}-1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2\\\\pi ck_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{\\\\lambda^4} or :I( u,T) = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi h u^3}{c^2}\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{h u}{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi k_\\\\mathrm{B} T u^2}{c^2} In other cases, Planck's law is written as u( u,T) = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{c} B_ u(T) for energy per unit volume (energy density). In this form, the Planck function and associated Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans limits are given by :u(\\\\lambda,T) = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi hc}{\\\\lambda^5}~\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}-1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{8\\\\pi k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{\\\\lambda^4} or :u( u,T) = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi h u^3}{c^3}\\\\frac{1}{e^\\\\frac{h u}{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi k_\\\\mathrm{B} T u^2}{c^3} See also * Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law * Wien's displacement law * Sakuma-Hattori equation References External links * Derivation at HyperPhysics Foundational quantum physics Obsolete theories in physics ","title":"Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law"},{"id":"243351","text":"Benjamin Chew (November 19, 1722 ‚Äì January 20, 1810) was a fifth-generation American, a Quaker-born legal scholar, a prominent and successful Philadelphia lawyer, head of the Pennsylvania Judiciary System under both Colony and Commonwealth, and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Province of Pennsylvania. Chew was well known for his precision and brevity in making legal arguments as well as his excellent memory, judgment, and knowledge of statutory law. His primary allegiance was to the supremacy of law and constitution. Trained in law at an early age by Andrew Hamilton, Benjamin Chew inherited his mentor's clients, the descendants of William Penn, including Thomas Penn (1702‚Äì1775) and his brother Richard Penn Sr. (1706‚Äì1771), and their sons Governor John Penn (1729‚Äì1795), Richard Penn Jr. (1734‚Äì1811), and John Penn (1760‚Äì1834). The Penn family was the basis of his private practice, and he represented them for six decades. He had a lifelong personal friendship with George Washington,Konkle, Burton Alva. (1932).

Petersburg, VA: The Dietz Press, Inc. p. 150. Chew lived and practiced law in Philadelphia four blocks from Independence Hall, and provided pro bono his knowledge of substantive law to America's Founding Fathers during the creation of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. Early life and education Chew coat of arms Benjamin Chew was the son of Samuel Chew, a physician and first Chief Justice of Delaware, and Mary Galloway Chew (1697‚Äì1734). He was born in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, at his father's plantation of Maidstone. Benjamin Chew's great- great-grandfather, John Chew (1587‚Äì1668), a successful merchant, arrived in Jamestown in 1622 on the ship Charitie; he was granted of land in Charles River (now York) County, Virginia. The young Chew took an interest in the field of law at an early age. In 1736, when he was 15 years old, he began to read law in the Philadelphia offices of the former Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Andrew Hamilton, then the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. The year before, Hamilton had won a landmark case in American jurisprudence by his eloquent pro bono defense of the publisher Peter Zenger. It established the precedent of truth as an absolute defense against charges of libel. Chew was strongly influenced by Hamilton's ideas about a free press, and also the reading materials which his mentor provided him, especially Sir Francis Bacon's Lawtracts.Konkle, 1932, p. 46. His understanding of English legal history, and especially the Charter of Liberties, enhanced by his later studies at London's Middle Temple, fostered Chew's enduring commitment to the civil liberties that are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, especially the right to free speech. After Hamilton's death in August 1741, Chew sailed to London to study law at the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, one of the four Inns of Court. He began to attend London theatre and read what friends recommended; his journal during these years shows his process of adopting aspects of English refinement expected of gentlemen, which he continued after returning to the colonies. His friend John Dickinson was already studying in London, a frequent destination for aspiring generations of young men from North America. Following his father's death, Chew returned to Pennsylvania in 1744. He began to practice law in Dover, Delaware, while supporting his siblings and stepmother.Konkle (1932), 32‚Äì37 Although Chew was raised in a Quaker family, he had first broken with Quaker tradition in 1741, when he agreed with his father, who had instructed a grand jury in New Castle on the lawfulness of resistance to an armed force. In 1747, at age 25, Chew also went against Quaker tradition when he took the Oath of Attorney in Pennsylvania. Chew moved to Philadelphia in 1754. He continued his legal responsibilities in both Delaware and Pennsylvania for the rest of his life.Konkle, 1932, 32‚Äì37. After early appointments in the Quaker-dominated government, following his second marriage he went into private practice in 1757; the following year joined the Anglican Church. He was taking a separate path to influence outside the Quaker elite. Marriage and family Chew wed Mary Galloway (1729‚Äì1755), his mother's niece, on June 13, 1747, at West River, Maryland. They had five daughters (Mary (1748‚Äì1788), Anna Marie (1749‚Äì1812), Elizabeth (1751‚Äì1815), Sarah (1753‚Äì1810), and Henrietta (1755‚Äì1756)) before Mary died. From 1754 to 1771, Chew and his family lived on Front Street in Philadelphia. Sophia Chew Nicklin Dallas, Second Lady of the United States He married again on September 12, 1757, to Elizabeth Oswald (1732‚Äì1819), daughter of James and Mary (Turner) Oswald. Elizabeth was the niece and heir to the estate of Captain Joseph Turner. Benjamin and Elizabeth had seven more daughters (Margaret (1760‚Äì1824), Juliana (1765‚Äì1845), Henrietta (1767‚Äì1848), Sophia (1769‚Äì1841), Maria (1771‚Äì1840), Harriet (1775‚Äì1861), and Catherine (1779‚Äì1831)), and two sons (Benjamin Jr. (1758‚Äì1844) and Joseph (1763‚Äì1764)). In 1758, Chew left the Quakers permanently and joined the Church of England; he and his wife had their son Benjamin baptized that year at Christ Church. They worshipped there with their growing family, and later at St. Peter's Church when they moved out to Germantown. This was part of a process of Anglicization that had begun when he was studying law at the Middle Temple in London.Doreen Skala, \\"Fox Hunting and Anglicization in Philadelphia\\", in Tanja Bueltmann, Locating the English Diaspora, 1500‚Äì2010, Liverpool University Press, 2012, pp. 63‚Äì64, accessed 8 November 2012 Chew greatly increased both wealth and property holdings when he married Elizabeth Oswald. They held numerous slaves to care for the properties and cultivate their commodity crops. In 1760, on the Chew's property \\"Whitehall\\" in Delaware, Richard Allen, was born into slavery. In 1768, recognizing the boy's early genius, Chew sold Allen, then eight years old, and all members of his immediate family to Stokley Sturgis, a known abolitionist and owner of a neighboring property in Delaware.Allen, Richard. (1960). The Life Experience and Gospel Labours of the Right Reverend Richard Allen, New York: Abingdon Press. p. 15 Richard Allen later became a preacher in the Methodist Church in Philadelphia, co-founder of the Free African Society, and the founder and first bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first African-American denomination in the United States. Law practice Mentored by Andrew Hamilton from an early age, Chew was highly effective in defending civil liberties and settling boundary disputes; he represented the descendants of William Penn and their proprietorship, the largest landholders in Pennsylvania, for more than 60 years. In 1757 Chew entered private practice: he derived most of his income from that, managing his second wife's considerable estate, and collecting quit-rents from his various properties.Konkle, 1932, p. 50-51. Chew continued the family practice of investing in land in the American colonies until the end of his life, expanding their holdings in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. In his early career, Chew often met with other ambitious young men of Philadelphia at the London Coffee House. Together in 1766, they organized the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club, the first in the United States. This adoption of an English sport was part of their becoming gentlemen; they committed to hunting together in the country a couple of times a week. In 1768, Chew was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, I: 38, 79, 80, II: 25, 59, III:27, 56-57,123-29,124,183-84, 233, 238,260, 296,444. Residences =Third Street House= In 1771, Chew purchased the former house of his client, Governor John Penn, on South Third Street; Penn had returned to England to settle his father's (Richard Penn Sr.) estate.Richards, Nancy. (1996). The City Home of Benjamin Chew, Sr., and His Family: A Case Study of the Textures of Life. Philadelphia: Cliveden of the National Trust, Inc. pp. 5‚Äì6. For almost five decades, the household on Third Street was filled by Benjamin and Elizabeth Chew, their son Benjamin, and their daughters Anna Marie, Elizabeth, Sarah, Margaret (Peggy), Juliana, Henrietta, Sophia, Maria, Harriet, and Catherine, all of whom were actively engaged in the social, civic, and cultural life of the nation's first capital. Three of the daughters retained ownership of the house until 1828. The Chews entertained many visiting dignitaries, such as John Penn, Tench Francis Jr., Robert, Thomas, and Samuel Wharton, Thomas Willing, John Cadwalader, Chief Justice William Allen and his wife Margaret, daughter of Andrew Hamilton, Dr. William Smith, Provost of the College of Philadelphia, botanist John Bartram, Edward Shippen III, Edward Shippen IV, and Peggy Shippen, Thomas Mifflin, later to become Governor of Pennsylvania, and Brigadier General Henry Bouquet, hero of the French and Indian War.Richards, 1996, p. 23-25.

(1885). The Republican Court, or, American Society in the Days of Washington. Boston: D. Appleton. p. 395. Harriet (1775‚Äì1861) was asked to entertain George Washington while his portrait was being painted.Griswold, 1885, p. 315, 339. In 1800, she married the only son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, signer of the Declaration of Independence, who built Homewood for them as a wedding gift.Perlman, Bernard B. (March 1955). \\"American Notes: Baltimore Mansion, 1801‚Äì1803\\", Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, 14. p. 27. Throughout the Revolutionary War, George Washington aided the transfer of letters between Mr. and Mrs. Chew, during months when they were forced to live apart.Richards, 1996, p. 50, 55. The Chew family's house on Third Street was situated between Spruce and Walnut Streets, next to the house of Samuel Powel, mayor of Philadelphia, and his wife, Elizabeth Willing Powel, who was one of George Washington's closest confidantes. \\"Led by Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Morris, and 'the dazzling Mrs. Bingham,' as Abigail Adams called her, the city embarked on a lavish program of public and private entertainment patterned on English and French models.\\"Richards, 1996, p. 60.

After the death of their parents, Henrietta, Maria, and Catherine Chew vacated their house on South Third Street, and moved to a family-owned property on Walnut Street. In 1828, they sold the house on South Third Street, and in 1830, the building was razed.Richards, 1996, 73‚Äì74. Cliveden in Germantown, Pennsylvania. =Cliveden= To protect his family from the diseases that plagued Philadelphia,Richards, 1996, p. 4.

On August 4, 1777, when the Executive Committee of the Continental Congress decided to place Chew in preventive detention in New Jersey, his wife and children vacated Cliveden and returned to their Third Street home. With Cliveden vacant, General Howe, the British Commander-in-Chief, quickly seized the house. Protected by its strong walls, he won the Battle of Germantown on October 4.Richards, Nancy. (1993). Cliveden: The Chew Mansion in Germantown. Philadelphia, PA: Cliveden of the National Trust. pp. 17‚Äì18. Fighting during the Battle of Germantown at the Chew house After Chew was released from parole in May 1778, he decided to move his family to Whitehall, their estate in Delaware, to buffer them from the political turbulence of Philadelphia. Chew sold Cliveden to Blair McClenahan because he was unable to afford the extensive repairs necessary after the Battle of Germantown.Richards, 1996, p. 54. While in Delaware, the Chews rented their house on Third Street to Don Juan de Miralles (the Spanish representative to the American government); the Marquis de Chastellux (principal liaison officer between the French Commander- in-Chief and George Washington); and to George and Martha Washington, from November 1781 to March 1782, during the Second Continental Congress.Richards, 1996, p. 54-55. By 1783, the Chews concluded that the political situation was safe enough for their family to return to Philadelphia.Richards, 1996, p. 55. They lived full-time in the house on South Third Street during the formation of the United States: the Constitutional Convention; the Congress of the Confederation; and in 1792, the official adoption of the Bill of Rights by the First United States Congress. In 1797, Chew bought back Cliveden. It remained under family ownership for another five generations. Cannonballs from the Battle of Germantown were embedded in its walls until 1972, when Chew's descendants donated the house to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. During restoration, most of the cannonballs were removed. Career Benjamin Chew was Speaker of the Lower House for the Delaware counties (1753‚Äì1758); Attorney General and member of the Council of Pennsylvania (1754‚Äì1769); Recorder of Philadelphia City (1755‚Äì1774); Master of Rolls (1755‚Äì1774; analogous to the Master of the Rolls role in England and Wales); and Provincial Councillor of Pennsylvania (1755). In 1757 he began private practice, which was his chief pursuit for years, somewhat reducing his political appointments in the Quaker government. That year, he was also elected a trustee of the Academy and College of Philadelphia (the origins of the University of Pennsylvania) and continued as such until 1791. He also taught numerous law students.University of Pennsylvania, University Archives and Records Center. (2011). Penn biographies: Benjamin Chew (1722‚Äì1810). Retrieved May 9, 2011. Foremost among Benjamin Chew's law students were Brigade Major Edward Tilghman and Judge William Tilghman. \\"These Tilghmans were so successful in the law that they were both offered the post of State Chief Justice in 1805.\\"Stockdale, & Holland, 2007, p. 103. He was selected as a Commissioner of Philadelphia (1761); appointed as Register-General of Wills (1765‚Äì1777); and as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (1774‚Äì1777). During the American Revolutionary War, the Executive Council governing the new state removed him from office in 1777 and kept him in preventive detention in New Jersey until after the British forces left the Philadelphia region. After the war, Chew resumed a position of influence in the new society and, eventually, its government. He was appointed as Judge and President of the High Court of Errors and Appeals (1791‚Äì1808). =Mason‚ÄìDixon line= By the time he was 29, Chew held a number of offices, both elected and appointed, in the Delaware and Pennsylvanian colonial governments. Appointed as Secretary of the Boundary Commission in 1750, Chew successfully represented the Penn family for the following eighteen years in their boundary dispute with first Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore and then Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore of Maryland. The dispute was finally resolved in 1768, when the Boundary Commission oversaw the development and completion of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line between Pennsylvania and Maryland.Scharf, John Thomas. (1879). History of Maryland: From the Earliest Period to the Present Day (Vol. 1). Baltimore: John B. Piet. p. 407-409. =Albany Conference= Benjamin Franklin's cartoon encouraging support for the Congress On June 19, 1754, the Albany Congress was held in Albany, New York. Twenty-one representatives of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire attended the Congress. Secretaries of each colony represented also attended, including Benjamin Chew of the Pennsylvania delegation. These secretaries helped formulate the plan to unite the colonies as a unified force at the time of threat from France during the Seven Years' War, known in North America as the French and Indian War, which began that year.Konkle, 1932, p. 63-64 The Albany Plan of Union was one of the first attempts to unite the British colonies. Benjamin Franklin proposed the plan but, as it greatly exceeded the scope of the congress, it was strongly debated by attendees. Six months later, Chew, aged 32, was appointed as Attorney General of the colony of Pennsylvania. =Easton Conference= In October 1758, The Easton Conference was held in Easton, Pennsylvania, to resolve conflicts created by The Walking Purchase of 1737, which had lasting effects on the relationships between Native Americans and the colonists. As Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Chew attended the negotiations for the Treaty of Easton and documented the proceedings in his \\"Journal of a Journey to Easton.\\" The conference concluded on October 26, and in November, Governor Denny announced to the Pennsylvania Assembly that \\"a general peace was secured at Easton.\\"Konkle, 1932, p. 87. =Attorney General= \\"From 1755 to 1769 Chew served as Attorney General of Pennsylvania and as the Recorder of Philadelphia, earning a reputation that was second to none.\\"Stockdale, Eric, & Holland, Randy J. (2007). Middle Temple lawyers and the American Revolution. Eagan, MN: Thomson West. p. 103.

The Stamp Act was repealed two months later. =Supreme Court Chief Justice= \\"Chew's political views were at all times close to those of his predecessor, William Allen. He supported the Proprietary interests, opposed the Stamp Act and other English abuses, but opposed independence.\\"Stockdale, & Holland, 2007, p. 105. \\"The Chew court...was without a question the most professional and formally trained high court to date.\\"Rowe, G.

Newark, DE: University of Delaware Press. p. 121. \\"Chew's pro-American views and actions were not enough to save him, but he was not persecuted in the way that some pacifists were, as his record of speaking out against British abuses was well known. It was not until the following year that his liberty was restricted\\" by the Executive Council ofStockdale, & Holland, 2007, p. 106. When he was finally paroled and sent to New Jersey for preventive detention as a suspected Loyalist, \\"Chew refused to take the action of the Council seriously at first, and thoroughly intimidated the young soldiers from the City Troop who were sent to pick him up. Eventually realizing his predicament he signed a parole...although he insisted that there was no charge against him except that he had held office under the Proprietor.\\"Coleman, John M. (1975). Thomas McKean: Forgotten Leader of the Revolution. Rockaway, NJ: American Faculty Press. p. 219. =Post-war: President of the High Court= After the state and national governments had been formed, in 1791, Chew was appointed by Thomas Mifflin, Pennsylvania's first Governor and the former President of the Continental Congress, to preside as the President over Pennsylvania's first High Court of Errors and Appeals. He held the position until he retired in 1808.Stockdale, & Holland, 2007, p. 110. > Pennsylvania at first made no provision for any appeal from its Supreme > Court, but in February 1780 legislation established the High Court of Errors > and Appeals.

Chew received the > highest compliment Pennsylvania could pay him: he was appointed by Governor > Thomas Mifflin as President of the High Court, despite the fact that he was > by then close to seventy. Political influence Prior to the American Revolution, Chew was friends with both George Washington and John Adams, and was a strong advocate for the colonies. As a lifelong pacifist, however, Chew believed that protest and reform were necessary to resolve the ongoing American conflicts with the British Parliament. Having been born and reared as a Quaker, he did not support active revolution. He maintained that position although he had left the Quakers and joined the Anglican Church in 1758. Early in the conflict, both the British and colonial sides claimed his allegiance since Chew had such a visible position in the colony and played so many important roles. Chew was undecided about the correct course to take. \\"I have stated that an opposition of force of arms to the lawful authority of the king or his ministries‚Ä¶is high treason, but in the moment when the king or his ministries shall exceed the constitutional authority vested in them ‚Ä¶ submission to their mandates becomes treason.\\" -Benjamin Chew, Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, in an address to the last provincial grand jury, April 10, 1776 On August 4, 1777, when General Howe and the British army were nearing Philadelphia, the Executive Council of the new government \\"issued a warrant for (Chew's) arrest on grounds of protecting the public safety. When the warrant was served two days later at his home in Philadelphia, Chew demanded to know 'by what authority and for what cause' he was charged.\\"Richards, 1993, p. 18. \\"As a lawyer, [Chew] believed that the warrant infringed on his rights as a free man; moreover, it violated the first principle of justice by prejudging him unheard. This, as he later recorded in notes concerning his arrest, 'struck at the liberties of everyone in the community and [he believed] it was his duty to oppose it and check it, if possible, in its infancy.'\\" The Executive Council of the Continental Congress decided at the last minute against allowing Chew to remain at Cliveden. For his own safety, they decided to allow both Chew and the Governor John Penn to be paroled at his wife Elizabeth Chew's house, \\"Solitude,\\" at the Union Forge Ironworks in New Jersey. Six months later, after the British forces left the region, both men returned to Philadelphia on May 15, 1778. Benjamin Chew's grave marker. =Post-war years= After the Revolution, Benjamin Chew's broad social circles continued to include representative of many faiths, as well as friends and politicians representing many disparate points of view.Richards, 1996, p. 59. Chew continued to participate in the meetings of the Tammany Society, to honor Tamanend, the Lenni-Lenape chief who first negotiated peace agreements with William Penn.Scharf, John Thomas, & Westcott, Thompson. (1884). History of Philadelphia, 1609‚Äì1884 (Vol. 3). Philadelphia: L.H. Everts & Co. p. 2082. \\"Although Benjamin Chew was not a participant in the Constitutional Convention of 1787‚Ä¶he and his family were part of the city's new social circle that included the Washingtons, the John Adams, the William Binghams, and the Robert Morrises‚Ä¶In large measure this was because Chew's legal perspicacity offered expertise needed by the new government.\\" After an extended illness, Chew died at Cliveden on January 20, 1810, and is buried at St. Peter's Churchyard, Philadelphia.

Founded by German, Quaker, and Mennonite families in 1683 as an independent borough, it was absorbed into Philadelphia in 1854. The area, which is about six miles northwest from the city center, now consists of two neighborhoods: 'Germantown' and 'East Germantown'. Germantown has played a significant role in American history; it was the birthplace of the American antislavery movement, the site of a Revolutionary War battle, the temporary residence of George Washington, the location of the first bank of the United States, and the residence of many notable politicians, scholars, artists, and social activists. Today the area remains rich in historic sites and buildings from the colonial era, some of which are open to the public. Boundaries Plan of lots in Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1689, showing lot owners in 1689 and 1714. Germantown stretches for about two miles along Germantown Avenue northwest from Windrim and Roberts Avenues. Germantown has been consistently bounded on the southwest by Wissahickon Avenue, on the southeast by Roberts Avenue, and on the east by Wister Street and Stenton Avenue, but its northwest border has expanded and contracted over the years. When first incorporated as a borough in 1689, Germantown was separated from the rural Germantown Township by Washington Lane; later, the border was expanded to Carpenter and East Gorgas Lanes; it was then rolled back to Washington Lane in 1846, () and remained there until the borough was absorbed into the city of Philadelphia in 1854. Modern borders of Germantown and East Germantown, Philadelphia Today, the western part of the former borough is the neighborhood known simply as 'Germantown' (though is sometimes called 'West Germantown') and the eastern part is the neighborhood of 'East Germantown'. While the boundary between the two neighborhoods is not well-defined and has varied over time, these days 'Germantown' usually refers to the part of the former borough that lies west of Germantown Avenue, up through West Johnson Street, and 'East Germantown' to the part that lies east of Germantown Avenue, up through East Upsal Street. The neighborhood of Mount Airy lies to the northwest, Ogontz and West Oak Lane to the northeast, Logan to the east, Nicetown‚ÄìTioga to the south, and East Falls to the southwest. The majority of Germantown is covered by the 19144 zip code, but the area north of Chew Avenue falls in the 19138 zip code.

Thomas Holme's Survey Map (1687) The Battle of Germantown, 1777 Although the founding of Germantown on October 6, 1683 was later to provide the date for German-American Day, a holiday in the United States, observed annually on October 6, historical research has shown that nearly all of the first thirteen Quaker and Mennonite families were in fact Dutch rather than Germans.N. Van der Sijs: Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops: The Influence of Dutch on the North American Languages (2019) page 223.William I. Hull: William Penn and the Dutch Quaker Migration to Pennsylvania (2018) The town was nevertheless named Germantown, as the direct vicinity of the settlement was inhabited by fifty-four German families who had accompanied Johan Printz to the Swedish settlement on the Delaware several years earlier and had resettled themselves.H. Naaman: History of Old Germantown (1907) page 20. Francis Daniel Pastorius was the first bailiff. Jacob Telner, Derick Isacks op den Graeff and his brother Abraham Isacks op den Graeff, Reynier Tyson, and Tennis Coender were burgesses, besides six committeemen. They had authority to hold \\"the general court of the corporation of Germantowne\\", to make laws for the government of the settlement, and to hold a court of record. This court went into operation in 1690, and continued its services for sixteen years. Sometimes, to distinguish Germantown from the upper portion of German township, outside the borough, the township portion was called Upper Germantown. In 1688, five years after its founding, Germantown became the birthplace of the anti-slavery movement in America. Pastorius, Gerret Hendericks, Derick Updegraeff and Abraham Updengraef gathered at Thones Kunders's house and wrote a two-page condemnation of slavery and sent it to the governing bodies of their Quaker church, the Society of Friends. The petition was mainly based upon the Bible's Golden Rule, \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\" Though the Quaker establishment took no immediate action, the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery was a clear and forceful argument against slavery and initiated the process of banning slavery in the Society of Friends (1776) and Pennsylvania (1780). In 1723, Germantown became the site of the first Church of the Brethren congregation in the New World. When Philadelphia was occupied by the British during the American Revolutionary War, British units were housed in Germantown. In the Battle of Germantown, on October 4, 1777, the Continental Army attacked the garrison. During the battle, a group of civilians fired on the British troops as they marched up the avenue, mortally wounding British officer James Agnew. The Americans withdrew after firing on one another in the confusion of the battle, which resulted in the battle becoming a British victory. The American losses amounted to 673 men and the British losses consisted of 575 men, but along with the American victory at Saratoga on October 17 when John Burgoyne surrendered, the battle led to the official recognition of the Americans by France, which formed an alliance with the Americans afterward. During his presidency, George Washington and his family lodged at the Deshler-Morris House in Germantown to escape the city and the yellow fever epidemic of 1793. The first bank of the United States was also located here during his administration. Germantown proper, and the adjacent German Township, were incorporated into the City of Philadelphia in 1854 by the Act of Consolidation. Italians began settling Germantown in 1880, and comprised an active and vibrant part of the community.Di Giacomo, Donna J. Italians of Philadelphia. Arcadia Publishing, 2007. , 9780738550206. p. 9. The significant changes that occurred in Philadelphia's demographics at the start of the 20th century caused major shifts in Germantown's ethnic makeup as well. When the first wave of the Great Migration brought more than 140,000 African Americans to the city from the South, long-established Philadelphians started to move to the outskirts. During this time, many German, Scots-Irish, and Irish families moved to Germantown. During the 1940s, a second mass migration of African Americans from the south to Philadelphia occurred. While the majority of middle-class African American newcomers first settled in North Philadelphia, the housing shortages in this area that followed the end of World War II caused later arrivals to move instead to the Northwest. This led to a wave of new housing construction. To meet the housing needs of the growing numbers of African American families moving into southern Germantown, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority allocated $10.6 million for the creation of public housing. Between 1954 and 1956 Germantown experienced an influx of lower-income African Americans, resulting in a decline in property values and triggering a \\"white flight\\" of the majority of white residents to the suburbs. The demographic shift caused a slow but steady decline in central Germantown's upscale shopping district, with the last department store, a J. C. Penney branch, closing in the early 1980s. The current demographics of Germantown reflects this shift. As of the 2010 US Census, Germantown proper is 77% black, 15% white, 3% non-white Hispanic, and 2% Asian, and East Germantown is 92% black, 3% white, 2% non-white Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Eugene Stackhouse, a retired former president of the Germantown Historical Society says that the demographic transition of Germantown into a predominantly black neighborhood was the result of the now illegal practice of blockbusting. \\"It was a great disgrace. Cheap houses would be sold to a black family, then the realtors would go around and tell the neighbors that the blacks are invading\\", said Stackhouse. The practice was used to trigger panic selling. Education =Primary and secondary schools= Public schools Germantown is zoned to the School District of Philadelphia, as is all of Philadelphia. Public schools located in Germantown include the Anna L. Lingelbach School (K‚Äì8), the John B. Kelly School (K‚Äì6), the John Wister Elementary School (K‚Äì6), the Hill Freedman Middle School (6‚Äì8), the Theodore Roosevelt Middle School (7‚Äì8), the Fitler Academics Plus School (1‚Äì8), and the Martin Luther King High School (9‚Äì12).

Transportation The first railroad in Philadelphia was the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad, which linked Germantown to a station at 9th and Green Streets in Center City. It opened in 1832, and was initially powered by horses. The inventor Matthias W. Baldwin built his first commissioned steam locomotive for the new railroad. Nicknamed Old Ironsides, it eventually reached a peak speed of 28 mph.\\"Matthias William Baldwin\\", in Lance Day and Ian Mcneil (eds.), Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology.

It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. Structure The trapezium is distinguished by a deep groove on its anterior surface. It is situated at the radial side of the carpus, between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal bone (the metacarpal bone of the thumb). It is homologous with the first distal carpal of reptiles and amphibians. =Surfaces= The trapezium is an irregular-shaped carpal bone found within the hand. The trapezium is found within the distal row of carpal bones, and is directly adjacent to the metacarpal bone of the thumb. On its ulnar surface are found the trapezoid and scaphoid bones. The superior surface is directed upward and medialward; medially it is smooth, and articulates with the scaphoid; laterally it is rough and continuous with the lateral surface. The inferior surface is oval, concave from side to side, convex from before backward, so as to form a saddle-shaped surface for articulation with the base of the first metacarpal bone. This saddle-shaped articulation is partially responsible for the thumb's opposable motion. The dorsal surface is smooth. The palmar surface is narrow and rough. At its upper part is a deep groove, running from above obliquely downward and medialward; it transmits the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis, and is bounded laterally by an oblique ridge. This surface gives origin to the Opponens pollicis and to the Abductor and Flexor pollicis brevis; it also affords attachment to the transverse carpal ligament. The lateral surface is broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The medial surface presents two facets; the upper, large and concave, articulates with the trapezoid bone; the lower, small and oval, with the base of the second metacarpal. =Tubercle of trapezium= The tubercle of trapezium is a tubercle found on the anterior surface of the bone. It is where sometimes abductor pollicis brevis muscle attaches. Function The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. The trapezium is the most radial of the bones surrounding the carpal tunnel. It is important in thumb movement. Clinical relevance The trapezium is susceptible to arthritis at the joint with the metacarpal bone of the thumb, due to overuse. History The etymology derives from the Greek trapezion which means \\"a little table\\", from trapeza meaning \\"table\\", itself from (te)tra- \\"four\\" and pod- \\"foot\\". The bone was first documented in 1840. Additional images File:Trapezium bone (left) - animation01.gifPosition of trapezium (shown in red). Left hand. Animation.

He was a scientist of the Pythagorean school and famous for being the reputed founder of mathematical mechanics, as well as a good friend of Plato. Life and work Archytas was born in Tarentum, Magna Graecia and was the son of Mnesagoras or Histiaeus. For a while, he was taught by Philolaus, and was a teacher of mathematics to Eudoxus of Cnidus. Archytas and Eudoxus' student was Menaechmus. As a Pythagorean, Archytas believed that only arithmetic, not geometry, could provide a basis for satisfactory proofs.Morris Kline, Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times Oxford University Press, 1972 p. 49 Archytas is believed to be the founder of mathematical mechanics.: Vitae philosophorum As only described in the writings of Aulus Gellius five centuries after him, he was reputed to have designed and built the first artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam, said to have actually flown some 200 meters.Aulus Gellius, \\"Attic Nights\\", Book X, 12.9 at LacusCurtiusARCHYTAS OF TARENTUM, Technology Museum of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece This machine, which its inventor called The pigeon, may have been suspended on a wire or pivot for its flight.Modern rocketry Archytas also wrote some lost works, as he was included by Vitruvius in the list of the twelve authors of works of mechanics.Vitruvius, De architectura, vii.14. Thomas Nelson Winter presents evidence that the pseudo-Aristotelian Mechanical Problems was actually authored by Archytas and misattributed.Thomas Nelson Winter, \\" The Mechanical Problems in the Corpus of Aristotle,\\" DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, 2007. Archytas named the harmonic mean, important much later in projective geometry and number theory, though he did not invent it.J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson. Archytas of Tarentum. The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. Visited 11 August 2011. According to Eutocius, Archytas solved the problem of doubling the cube in his manner (though he believed \\"that only arithmetic, not geometry\\", could provide a basis for satisfactory proofs) with a geometric construction.Eutocius, commentary on Archimedes' On the sphere and cylinder. Hippocrates of Chios before, reduced this problem to finding mean proportionals. Archytas' theory of proportions is treated in book VIII of Euclid's Elements, where is the construction for two proportional means, equivalent to the extraction of the cube root. According to Diogenes La√´rtius, this demonstration, which uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals between magnitudes, was the first in which geometry was studied with concepts of mechanics.Plato blamed Archytas for his contamination of geometry with mechanics (Plutarch, Symposiacs, Book VIII, Question 2): And therefore Plato himself dislikes Eudoxus, Archytas, and Menaechmus for endeavoring to bring down the doubling the cube to mechanical operations; for by this means all that was good in geometry would be lost and corrupted, it falling back again to sensible things, and not rising upward and considering immaterial and immortal images, in which God being versed is always God. The Archytas curve, which he used in his solution of the doubling the cube problem, is named after him. Politically and militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in his generation, somewhat comparable to Pericles in Athens a half-century earlier. The Tarentines elected him strategos, 'general', seven years in a row ‚Äì a step that required them to violate their own rule against successive appointments. He was allegedly undefeated as a general, in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian neighbors. The Seventh Letter of Plato asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with Dionysius II of Syracuse. In his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for Plato's philosopher king, and that he influenced Plato's political philosophy as expressed in The Republic and other works (i.e., how does a society obtain good rulers like Archytas, instead of bad ones like Dionysius II?). Archytas may have drowned in a shipwreck in the shore of Mattinata, where his body laid unburied on the shore until a sailor humanely cast a handful of sand on it. Otherwise, he would have had to wander on this side of the Styx for a hundred years, such the virtue of a little dust, munera pulveris, as Horace calls it in Ode 1.28 on which this information on his death is based. The poem, however, is difficult to interpret and it is not certain that the shipwrecked and Archytas are in fact the same person. The crater Archytas on the Moon is named in his honour. =Archytas curve= The Archytas curve The Archytas curve is created by placing a semicircle (with a diameter of d) on the diameter of one of the two circles of a cylinder (which also has a diameter of d) such that the plane of the semicircle is at right angles to the plane of the circle and then rotating the semicircle about one of its ends in the plane of the cylinder's diameter. This rotation will cut out a portion of the cylinder forming the Archytas curve. Another way of thinking of this construction is that the Archytas curve is basically the result of cutting out a torus formed by rotating a hemisphere of diameter d out of a cylinder also of diameter d. A cone can go through the same procedures also producing the Archytas curve. Archytas used his curve to determine the construction of a cube with a volume of one third of that of a given cube. = The Delian Problem = Doubling the volume of a cube, given a single side. Solved by Archytas. ***WARNING: This section contains text that has been pasted from another source, without inclusion of relevant equations*** One of Archytas' most notable accomplishments comes in the form of a mathematical solution to The Delian Problem, more informally known as doubling the cube. The problem is as follows: given a cube that a side is known, construct a cube with double the original volume. The proof of his model comes from Eudemus, who in the late 4th century wrote a history of geometry, including solutions to this problem from multiple mathematicians and philosophers before him- namely Eudoxus and Menaechmus. Although Eudemus' work did not survive to current day, a transmission of his geometric solution does survive in the form of Eutocius' commentary on Archimedes' De Sphaera et Cylindro. Archytas' solution begins with the concept of mean proportionality and the construction of four similar triangles. Each triangle's hypotenuse and long leg are proportionally similar as the triangle increase in size, which is essentially today's version of similarity of triangles. Archytas then applied the mean proportionals for a given length of a cube. If the volume of the original cube is written as V1 = x3, where x represents the length of a side, we let k1 and k2 represent the proportionality constants, and the cube is then doubled so that a side length is now 2x, a mean proportional between the two can be written as . With the proportionals finished, Archytas completed the solution to his similar triangles as follows: If you cube the proportion of the original length of the side and solve using the mean proportional set, the solution comes to After using light algebra, where the k1 variable represents the edge of the newly doubled cube. = Harmonic Theory = By the time of his analysis, it was known from the Pythagorean diatonic scale that whole numbers alone accounted for musical intervals on a scale. Archytas's work on musical scales included a thorough proof that no mean proportional numbers, like the ones used in his solving of the double cube problem, exist between basic music intervals (the difference in pitch between two sounds). This is to say that the basic interval, does not include any mean proportional number, and cannot then be divided in half. The octave can be doubled without violating this rule, as multiplying a whole number by 2 will always result in a whole number, and can therefore be equated by two mean proportional ratios. = Cosmology = Due to the severe scarcity of resources for Archytas' direct work, it is difficult to pinpoint his exact thoughts on the universe. Through Eudemus and later Simplicius' commentary, however, his thought experiment in regards to the size of the universe remain intact to current day. The experiment is credited as being an influential spark through the early ages, even though Plato nor Aristotle bought the argument. In his experiment for others to participate and decide for themselves, Archytas tells of a scenario in which he is at the effective edge of the fixed stars. He says that if he outreaches his arm, or his stick (staff), that his hand will push the limit of what the edge is. He is then free to move into the newly created space and outstretch his staff once more, thus increasing the limit of space. With his argument, he attested that space, the region of the fixed stars, is infinite. This thought persisted even through modern day, although it is important to note that his model has a defined edge, whereas some current models do not account for a defined edge of space.

He presented the shows Dale's Supermarket Sweep from 1993 until 2001 and again in 2007, the National Lottery game show In It to Win It between 2002 and 2016 and the 2008 series of Hole in the Wall. Winton also presented Pets Win Prizes (1995‚Äì96) and The Other Half (1997‚Äì2002). Early life Winton was born on 22 May 1955 to a Jewish father, Gary Winton, and actress Sheree Winton, a Jewish convert. Winton's father died on the day of his bar mitzvah and Winton was brought up by his mother. Winton's mother died by suicide in 1976 while suffering from depression. Career =Radio= Winton started DJing in clubs in Richmond in 1972, where he met Steve Allen, the LBC radio presenter. The two remained friends thereafter, and lived together for a period and would go on holiday together. From there he had a selection of jobs including selling timeshares. In 1982, Winton moved to London and began his entertainment career on the London club circuit, where he DJ'd at weekends. This led him to the United Biscuits Radio Network where he did a variety of jobs working for Adrian Love, before getting his own morning show. From here he joined Radio Trent in Nottingham, where he presented a weekend show, moving to the weekday mid-morning show, before leaving in 1985, and going on to work at a number of other local radio stations including Chiltern Radio, Beacon Radio (in Wolverhampton, for 3 years) as well as Blue Danube Radio in Vienna, Austria.The Daily Telegraph, London. Obituary 20 April 2018 In 2000, Winton took over from Alan Freeman to present Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2, and hosted the show until 30 October 2010, when Tony Blackburn replaced him. Winton sat in for Steve Wright and Liza Tarbuck on BBC Radio 2, covering the latter's Saturday show in September 2013 and November/December 2016. =Television= Winton began his television career in 1986 on Pet Watch, before working for Channel 4, Lifestyle Channel and ITV. From 1993 to 2000, he hosted Dale's Supermarket Sweep during the daytime TV period on ITV. In 2007, Supermarket Sweep was revived after a -year absence. Winton portrayed himself as an irritating game show presenter in Danny Boyle's 1996 film Trainspotting. In 1995‚Äì96, Winton presented BBC's Saturday night game show Pets Win Prizes. In 1997, he presented the final of The Great British Song Contest, the UK's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, due to a tie-in with the lottery programme. Between that year and 2002, he also presented a dating show called The Other Half. In 1999, he appeared on the sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme with Kathy Burke in the episode Do They Take Sugar?. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 2000 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. In 2001, he presented Channel 5's endurance show Touch the Truck. In 2002, Winton began presenting the National Lottery game show In It to Win It. In 2003, he appeared in the BBC Three mockumentary, Dale's Wedding, in which he supposedly married the UK celebrity Nell McAndrew. From 2003‚Äì04, he hosted two series of Stars Reunited where the casts of popular British television series were reunited after many years. Between 2004 and 2006, he presented three series of the celebrity weight loss \\"boot camp\\" programme, Celebrity Fit Club on ITV. Winton presented BBC One's Saturday night entertainment programme Hole In The Wall in 2008, based on the Japanese original, where contestants in skin-tight lycra costumes contorted themselves to fit through oddly-shaped holes in a moving wall. The show returned for a second series in 2009 but Anton du Beke replaced Winton as host. Winton began appearing in television advertisements for cashmygold.co.uk in 2010. Winton appeared on Matt Lucas and David Walliams' BBC comedy series Come Fly With Me. He appeared in the last episode of the series, playing himself. In 2012, he hosted one-off ITV game show Dale's Great Getaway and In February 2018, Winton hosted travelogue series Dale Winton's Florida Fly Drive aired on Channel 5. Personal life and death In 2002, Winton released his autobiography in which he wrote about his rise to fame and his actress mother's suicide, and came out as homosexual. On 18 April 2018, Jan Kennedy, Winton's long-term agent, announced that he had died at his home. On 19 April a spokesman for Scotland Yard said that police were treating the death as \\"unexplained\\" but did not believe it to be suspicious. According to his friend, Gloria Hunniford, \\"Dale had a lot of things going wrong, he had pain with arthritis, he had a heart complaint, he had a chest infection, and we all know how the winter affected that. He had asthma as well.\\"Gloria Hunniford on death of Dale Winton, hellomagazine.com; accessed 1 June 2018. The coroner concluded that Winton died of natural causes. Winton had recently moved from a ¬£2.9 million apartment in Regent's Park to a property in Whetstone, North London. Winton's friends celebrated his life with a non-religious humanist funeral ceremony from Humanists UK on 22 May, his birthday. His eulogy was preserved as part of a public historical archive of humanist funerals.

In Anglo-Saxon England, a different system was used to achieve similar ends, and was known as the fyrd. Origins The leidangr of Norway is first mentioned AD 985 by Scaldic Courtly Poets of Jarl Haakon of Western Norway and his son Erik. In each poem, the princes are praised for summoning the ships of the leidangr to the Battle of Hjorungavaagr against a Danish fleet. Later on the King of Norway, Harald Hardrada (died 1066) is praised by two Court-Scalds for summoning the leidangr to attack Denmark. Harald is also called king of the leidangr and the latter is termed almenningr, the duty and right of all men. During the 11th century Danish naval forces though not termed leidangr, are sporadically praised as led by Danish kings (as Knut in his conquest of England). May 21, 1085 a Danish royal charter stipulates, that certain people on the lands of the canons of Lund are liable to pay fines for neglecting expeditio.Lund, Niels: The armies of Swein Forkbeard and Cnut: leding or lid.

Structure The lei√∞angr was a system organising a coastal fleet with the aim of defence, coerced trade, plunderings, and aggressive wars. Normally, the fleet levy was on expeditions for two or three summer months. All free men were obliged to take part in or contribute to the lei√∞angr. All of the lei√∞angr was called to arms when invading forces threatened the land. In the expeditions, only a fraction of the ships would take part, but as expeditions often were profitable, many magnates and chieftains tried to join with their people as often as possible. The leidang divided the land into districts, ship's crews or ship communities, \\"skiprei√∞a\\" (Old Norse), \\"skip√¶n\\" (Danish), \\"skeppslag\\" or \\"roslag\\" (Swedish), \\"skipreide\\" or \\"skibrede\\" (modern Norwegian), and required every skipreide to deliver one ship and crew. These skipreide were administrative areas in which residents were assigned to outfit a ship for military use. They were collectively responsible to build, maintain, equip and staff a leidangsskip (coastal defense ship), fully provisioned for two or three months. Skipreide were mainly on the coast, but also extended quite far inland along fjords and deep waterways (‚Äúas far inland as the salmon runs‚Äù), to safeguard the procurement of timber for building of the warships. If enemy forces attacked the country, fires built on high hills would mobilize the farmers to the skipreide. The number of farms in an area determined the size of a skipreide. It did not usually include the entire parish, nor was it confined to a parish; it could include farms from several parishes.https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Norwegian_Skipreide The farmers of each district had to build and equip a rowed sailing ship. The size of the ships was defined as a standardized number of oars, initially 40 oars, later 24 oars. In Norway, there were 279 such districts in 1277, in Denmark two-three times as many. The head of a district was called \\"styrima√∞r\\" or \\"styr√¶smand\\", steersman, and he functioned as captain of the ship. The smallest unit was the crew of peasants who had to arm and provide for one oarsman (\\"hafn√¶\\" in Danish, \\"hamna\\" in Swedish, \\"mannger√∞\\" in Old Norse). In Sweden a \\"hamna\\" was made up of two \\"attung\\", which was \\"two eighth parts of a village\\". One attung seems to have been equal to the land area it took to feed an ordinary family (around 12 acres, see Hide (unit), Virgate and Oxgang for English equivalents). Each attung also regard as having a \\"share\\" in the raid, so one who owned two attung had twice as much chance to go on the raid as one who owned only one. Those who owned less than an attung had to team up with others to form a unit of one attung and share the burdens as well as the profit. According to the Law of Uppland, the hundreds of Uppland provided as many as four ships each (four ships, each with 24 crewmen and a steersman, each equals 100 men), those of V√§stmanland two ships and those of Roslagen one ship (the name indicate that this was seen as just one ship's crew but they were not part of a hundred and might have had the same rights/function of whole hundred only fewer people). The older laws regulating the lei√∞angr (the Norwegian \\"Older Law of the Gulating\\" dates to the 11th or 12th century) require every man to, as a minimum, arm himself with an axe or a sword in addition to spear and shield, and for every rowbench (typically of two men) to have a bow and 24 arrows. Later 12th-13th century changes to this law code list more extensive equipment for the more affluent freemen, with helmet, mail hauberk, shield, spear and sword being what the well-to-do farmer or burgher must bring to war. In 12th-13th-century sources detailing the 11th century, jarls are mentioned as the chieftain of the lei√∞angr. In the 12th century, a bishop could also be head of the fleet levy, although typically nobles led levies in the 12th to 14th centuries. Equipment At the start of its origins in the early Dark Ages, the majority of the leidang would have been unarmoured. Some of the wealthier men may have worn leather and iron spangenhelms, while the wealthiest would wear mail or possibly leather armour. As the Viking Age began, the Leidang slowly began to improve in terms of armour as their areas became richer. By the 9th century, most members of a Leidang would have had helmets of iron or leather construction, either of the spangenhelm or Nasal Helm design. Drengrs would have worn mail, while wealthier freemen may have worn leather or padded cloth. Spears were common to all men, and many would have had short hand axes. Nobles and wealthy freemen would have had swords. Shields were used by all, and were usually round and of wood and leather construction, sometimes with leather or iron binding around the rim. By the 12th century, helmets and padded gambesons were very common, the Kettle hat type of helmet now being used alongside the earlier Nasal Helm and Spangenhelm types. Padded armour and mail were also more common among ordinary men. Evolution In parts of the Scandinavian countries, the lei√∞angr evolved to a tax in the 12th century to 13th century, paid by all (free) farmers until the 19th century, although the ship-levy was frequently called out and used in the 13th‚Äì15th centuries, with the Norwegian lei√∞angr fleet going as far as Scotland in the 1260s. The use of the levy-tax as opposed to the use of maritime forces was more prevalent in Denmark and Sweden than Norway, since the Norwegian kingdom always depended heavily on fleet- based forces rather than land-based ones. Skipreide, originally a defense system, later assumed other powers, such as to legal authority to pass laws and financial authority to levy taxes. Towards the end of the 13th century, they only existed for these purposes. In about 1660, skipreide were converted into tinglags, court districts that included a bygdeting (community court) or a byting (city court).https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Norwegian_Skipreide England In Anglo-Saxon times, defences were based on the fyrd. It was a militia called up from the districts threatened with attack. Service in the fyrd was usually of short duration and participants were expected to provide their own arms and provisions. The origins of the fyrd can be traced back to at least the 7th century, and it is likely that the obligation of Englishmen to serve in the fyrd dates from before its earliest appearance in written records.Hooper and Bennett. The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: The Middle Ages, 768‚Äì1487. pp. 22‚Äì24 Alfred the Great is credited with the development of the fyrd system together with the building of \\"burhs\\", the development of a cavalry force, and the building of a fleet. Each element of the system was meant to remedy defects in the West Saxon military establishment exposed by the Viking invasions. If, under the existing system, he could not assemble forces quickly enough to intercept mobile Viking raiders, the obvious answer was to have a standing field force. If this entailed transforming the West Saxon fyrd from a sporadic levy of king's men and their retinues into a mounted standing army, so be it. If his kingdom lacked strongpoints to impede the progress of an enemy army, he would build them. If the enemy struck from the sea, he would counter them with his own naval power. Characteristically, all of Alfred's innovations were firmly rooted in traditional West Saxon practice, drawing as they did on the three so-called ‚Äòcommon burdens' of bridge work, fortress repair and service on the king's campaigns that all holders of bookland and royal loanland owed the Crown. Where Alfred revealed his genius was in designing the field force and burhs to be parts of a coherent military system. Neither Alfred's reformed fyrd nor his burhs alone would have afforded a sufficient defence against the Vikings; together, however, they robbed the Vikings of their major strategic advantages: surprise and mobility. The fyrd was used heavily by King Harold in 1066, for example in resisting invasion by Harold Hardrada and William of Normandy.J. W. Fortescue (1899) A History of the British Army, volume I The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the fyrd as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \\"ridiculous fantasy\\": > The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a > national army or fyrd is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the > late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military > conscription.Sturdy, David Alfred the Great Constable (1995), p. 153 Henry I of England, the Anglo-Norman king who promised at his coronation to restore the laws of Edward the Confessor and who married a Scottish princess with West Saxon royal forebears, called up the fyrd to supplement his feudal levies, as an army of all England, as Orderic Vitalis reports, to counter the abortive invasions of his brother Robert Curthose, both in the summer of 1101 and in autumn 1102.C.

The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into. The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to hedge risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive. Payoffs The value of a forward position at maturity depends on the relationship between the delivery price (K) and the underlying price (S_{T}) at that time. * For a long position this payoff is: f_T = S_T - K * For a short position, it is: f_T= K-S_T Since the final value (at maturity) of a forward position depends on the spot price which will then be prevailing, this contract can be viewed, from a purely financial point of view, as \\"a bet on the future spot price\\" File:Long_forward_payoff.png File:Short_forward_payoff.png How a forward contract works Suppose that Bob wants to buy a house a year from now. At the same time, suppose that Andy currently owns a $100,000 house that he wishes to sell a year from now. Both parties could enter into a forward contract with each other. Suppose that they both agree on the sale price in one year's time of $104,000 (more below on why the sale price should be this amount). Andy and Bob have entered into a forward contract. Bob, because he is buying the underlying, is said to have entered a long forward contract. Conversely, Andy will have the short forward contract. At the end of one year, suppose that the current market valuation of Andy's house is $110,000. Then, because Andy is obliged to sell to Bob for only $104,000, Bob will make a profit of $6,000. To see why this is so, one needs only to recognize that Bob can buy from Andy for $104,000 and immediately sell to the market for $110,000. Bob has made the difference in profit. In contrast, Andy has made a potential loss of $6,000, and an actual profit of $4,000. The similar situation works among currency forwards, in which one party opens a forward contract to buy or sell a currency (e.g. a contract to buy Canadian dollars) to expire/settle at a future date, as they do not wish to be exposed to exchange rate/currency risk over a period of time. As the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars fluctuates between the trade date and the earlier of the date at which the contract is closed or the expiration date, one party gains and the counterparty loses as one currency strengthens against the other. Sometimes, the buy forward is opened because the investor will actually need Canadian dollars at a future date such as to pay a debt owed that is denominated in Canadian dollars. Other times, the party opening a forward does so, not because they need Canadian dollars nor because they are hedging currency risk, but because they are speculating on the currency, expecting the exchange rate to move favorably to generate a gain on closing the contract. In a currency forward, the notional amounts of currencies are specified (ex: a contract to buy $100 million Canadian dollars equivalent to, say US$75.2 million at the current rate‚Äîthese two amounts are called the notional amount(s)). While the notional amount or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the leverage created, which is typical in derivative contracts. Example of how forward prices should be agreed upon Continuing on the example above, suppose now that the initial price of Andy's house is $100,000 and that Bob enters into a forward contract to buy the house one year from today. But since Andy knows that he can immediately sell for $100,000 and place the proceeds in the bank, he wants to be compensated for the delayed sale. Suppose that the risk free rate of return R (the bank rate) for one year is 4%. Then the money in the bank would grow to $104,000, risk free. So Andy would want at least $104,000 one year from now for the contract to be worthwhile for him ‚Äì the opportunity cost will be covered. Spot‚Äìforward parity ''' For liquid assets (\\"tradeables\\"), spot‚Äìforward parity provides the link between the spot market and the forward market. It describes the relationship between the spot and forward price of the underlying asset in a forward contract. While the overall effect can be described as the cost of carry, this effect can be broken down into different components, specifically whether the asset: * pays income, and if so whether this is on a discrete or continuous basis * incurs storage costs * is regarded as ** an investment asset, i.e. an asset held primarily for investment purposes (e.g. gold, financial securities); ** or a consumption asset, i.e. an asset held primarily for consumption (e.g. oil, iron ore etc.) =Investment assets= For an asset that provides no income, the relationship between the current forward (F_0) and spot (S_0) prices is :F_0 = S_0 e^{rT} where r is the continuously compounded risk free rate of return, and T is the time to maturity. The intuition behind this result is that given you want to own the asset at time T, there should be no difference in a perfect capital market between buying the asset today and holding it and buying the forward contract and taking delivery. Thus, both approaches must cost the same in present value terms. For an arbitrage proof of why this is the case, see Rational pricing below. For an asset that pays known income, the relationship becomes: * Discrete: F_0 = (S_0 -I)e^{rT} * Continuous: F_0 = S_0 e^{(r-q)T} where I = the present value of the discrete income at time t_0 < T, and q \\\\% p.a. is the continuously compounded dividend yield over the life of the contract. The intuition is that when an asset pays income, there is a benefit to holding the asset rather than the forward because you get to receive this income. Hence the income (I or q) must be subtracted to reflect this benefit. An example of an asset which pays discrete income might be a stock, and an example of an asset which pays a continuous yield might be a foreign currency or a stock index. For investment assets which are commodities, such as gold and silver, storage costs must also be considered. Storage costs can be treated as 'negative income', and like income can be discrete or continuous. Hence with storage costs, the relationship becomes: * Discrete: F_0 = (S_0 +U)e^{rT} * Continuous: F_0 = S_0 e^{(r+u)T} where U = the present value of the discrete storage cost at time t_0 < T, and u \\\\% p.a. is the continuously compounded storage cost where it is proportional to the price of the commodity, and is hence a 'negative yield'. The intuition here is that because storage costs make the final price higher, we have to add them to the spot price. =Consumption assets= Consumption assets are typically raw material commodities which are used as a source of energy or in a production process, for example crude oil or iron ore. Users of these consumption commodities may feel that there is a benefit from physically holding the asset in inventory as opposed to holding a forward on the asset. These benefits include the ability to \\"profit from\\" (hedge against) temporary shortages and the ability to keep a production process running, and are referred to as the convenience yield. Thus, for consumption assets, the spot- forward relationship is: * Discrete storage costs: F_0 = (S_0 + U)e^{(r-y)T} * Continuous storage costs: F_0 = S_0 e^{(r+u-y)T} where y \\\\% p.a. is the convenience yield over the life of the contract. Since the convenience yield provides a benefit to the holder of the asset but not the holder of the forward, it can be modelled as a type of 'dividend yield'. However, it is important to note that the convenience yield is a non cash item, but rather reflects the market's expectations concerning future availability of the commodity. If users have low inventories of the commodity, this implies a greater chance of shortage, which means a higher convenience yield. The opposite is true when high inventories exist. =Cost of carry= The relationship between the spot and forward price of an asset reflects the net cost of holding (or carrying) that asset relative to holding the forward. Thus, all of the costs and benefits above can be summarised as the cost of carry, c. Hence, * Discrete: F_0 = (S_0+U-I)e^{(r-y)T} * Continuous: F_0 = S_0 e^{cT},\\\\text{ where }c = r-q+u-y. Relationship between the forward price and the expected future spot price 232px The market's opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be in the future is the expected future spot price. Hence, a key question is whether or not the current forward price actually predicts the respective spot price in the future. There are a number of different hypotheses which try to explain the relationship between the current forward price, F_{0} and the expected future spot price, E(S_{T}). The economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that in general, the natural hedgers of a commodity are those who wish to sell the commodity at a future point in time.J.M. Keynes, A Treatise on Money, London: Macmillan, 1930J.R. Hicks, Value and Capital, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939 Thus, hedgers will collectively hold a net short position in the forward market. The other side of these contracts are held by speculators, who must therefore hold a net long position. Hedgers are interested in reducing risk, and thus will accept losing money on their forward contracts. Speculators on the other hand, are interested in making a profit, and will hence only enter the contracts if they expect to make money. Thus, if speculators are holding a net long position, it must be the case that the expected future spot price is greater than the forward price. In other words, the expected payoff to the speculator at maturity is: :E(S_{T}-K) = E(S_{T}) - K, where K is the delivery price at maturity Thus, if the speculators expect to profit, :E(S_{T}) - K > 0 :E(S_{T}) > K :E(S_{T}) > F_{0}, as K = F_{0} when they enter the contract This market situation, where E(S_{T}) > F_{0}, is referred to as normal backwardation. Forward/futures prices converge with the spot price at maturity, as can be seen from the previous relationships by letting T go to 0 (see also basis); then normal backwardation implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are increasing over time. The opposite situation, where E(S_{T}) < F_{0}, is referred to as contango. Likewise, contango implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are falling over time.Contango Vs. Normal Backwardation , Investopedia Futures versus Forwards Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange- traded, or defined on standardized assets.Forward Contract on Wikinvest Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or \\"true-ups\\" in margin requirements like futures, that is the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. Therefore forward contracts have a significant counterparty risk which is also the reason why they are not readily available to retail investors. However, being traded over the counter (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark- to-market and daily margin calls. Having no upfront cashflows is one of the advantages of a forward contract compared to its futures counterpart. Especially when the forward contract is denominated in a foreign currency, not having to post (or receive) daily settlements simplifies cashflow management. Compared to the futures markets it is very difficult to close out one's position, that is to rescind the forward contract. For instance while being long in a forward contract, entering short into another forward contract might cancel out delivery obligations but adds to credit risk exposure as there are now three parties involved. Closing out a contract almost always involves reaching out to the counterparty. Compared to their futures counterparts, forwards (especially Forward Rate Agreements) need convexity adjustments, that is a drift term that accounts for future rate changes. In futures contracts, this risk remains constant whereas a forward contract's risk changes when rates change. Outright versus Premium Outright prices, as opposed to premium points or forward points, are quoted in absolute price units. Outrights are used in markets where there is no (unitary) spot price or rate for reference, or where the spot price (rate) is not easily accessible. Conversely, in markets with easily accessible spot prices or basis rates, in particular the Foreign exchange market and OIS market, forwards are usually quoted using premium points or forward points. That is using the spot price or basis rate as reference forwards are quoted as the difference in pips between the outright price and the spot price for FX, or the difference in basis points between the forward rate and the basis rate for interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Note: The term outright is used in the futures markets in a similar way but is contrasted with futures spreads instead of premium points, which is more than just a quoting convention, and in particular involves the simultaneous transaction in two outright futures. Rational pricing If S_{t} is the spot price of an asset at time t, and r is the continuously compounded rate, then the forward price at a future time T must satisfy F_{t,T} = S_t e^{r(T-t)}. To prove this, suppose not. Then we have two possible cases. Case 1: Suppose that F_{t,T} > S_t e^{r (T-t)}. Then an investor can execute the following trades at time t: # go to the bank and get a loan with amount S_t at the continuously compounded rate r; # with this money from the bank, buy one unit of asset for S_t; # enter into one short forward contract costing 0. A short forward contract means that the investor owes the counterparty the asset at time T. The initial cost of the trades at the initial time sum to zero. At time T the investor can reverse the trades that were executed at time t. Specifically, and mirroring the trades 1., 2. and 3. the investor #' repays the loan to the bank. The inflow to the investor is \\\\- S_t e^{r(T-t)}; #' settles the short forward contract by selling the asset for F_{t,T}. The cash inflow to the investor is now F_{t,T} because the buyer receives S_{T} from the investor. The sum of the inflows in 1.' and 2.' equals F_{t,T} - S_t e^{r (T-t)}, which by hypothesis, is positive. This is an arbitrage profit. Consequently, and assuming that the non-arbitrage condition holds, we have a contradiction. This is called a cash and carry arbitrage because you \\"carry\\" the asset until maturity. Case 2: Suppose that F_{t,T} < S_t e^{r (T-t)}. Then an investor can do the reverse of what he has done above in case 1. This means selling one unit of the asset, investing this money into a bank account and entering a long forward contract costing 0. Note: if you look at the convenience yield page, you will see that if there are finite assets/inventory, the reverse cash and carry arbitrage is not always possible. It would depend on the elasticity of demand for forward contracts and such like. =Extensions to the forward pricing formula= Suppose that FV_T(X) is the time value of cash flows X at the contract expiration time T. The forward price is then given by the formula: : F_{t,T} = S_t e^{r(T-t)} - FV_T(\\\\text{all cash flows over the life of the contract}) The cash flows can be in the form of dividends from the asset, or costs of maintaining the asset. If these price relationships do not hold, there is an arbitrage opportunity for a riskless profit similar to that discussed above. One implication of this is that the presence of a forward market will force spot prices to reflect current expectations of future prices. As a result, the forward price for nonperishable commodities, securities or currency is no more a predictor of future price than the spot price is - the relationship between forward and spot prices is driven by interest rates. For perishable commodities, arbitrage does not have this The above forward pricing formula can also be written as: :F_{t,T} = (S_t - I_t) e^{r(T-t)} \\\\, Where I_t is the time t value of all cash flows over the life of the contract. For more details about pricing, see forward price. Theories of why a forward contract exists Allaz and Vila (1993) suggest that there is also a strategic reason (in an imperfect competitive environment) for the existence of forward trading, that is, forward trading can be used even in a world without uncertainty. This is due to firms having Stackelberg incentives to anticipate their production through forward contracts.

It was published by Felix Klein in 1872 as Vergleichende Betrachtungen √ºber neuere geometrische Forschungen. It is named after the University Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, where Klein worked. By 1872, non-Euclidean geometries had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein's method was fundamentally innovative in three ways: :* Projective geometry was emphasized as the unifying frame for all other geometries considered by him. In particular, Euclidean geometry was more restrictive than affine geometry, which in turn is more restrictive than projective geometry. :* Klein proposed that group theory, a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of symmetry, was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the theory of equations in the form of Galois theory. :* Klein made much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about conic sections, but not about circles or angles because those notions were not invariant under projective transformations (something familiar in geometrical perspective). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together could be explained by the way subgroups of a symmetry group related to each other. Later, √âlie Cartan generalized Klein's homogeneous model spaces to Cartan connections on certain principal bundles, which generalized Riemannian geometry. The problems of nineteenth century geometry Since Euclid, geometry had meant the geometry of Euclidean space of two dimensions (plane geometry) or of three dimensions (solid geometry). In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, M√∂bius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical physicists that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them. With every geometry, Klein associated an underlying group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is a priori meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you remove required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general). Homogeneous spaces In other words, the \\"traditional spaces\\" are homogeneous spaces; but not for a uniquely determined group. Changing the group changes the appropriate geometric language. In today's language, the groups concerned in classical geometry are all very well known as Lie groups: the classical groups. The specific relationships are quite simply described, using technical language. =Examples= For example, the group of projective geometry in n real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of n-dimensional real projective space (the general linear group of degree , quotiented by scalar matrices). The affine group will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen hyperplane at infinity. This subgroup has a known structure (semidirect product of the general linear group of degree n with the subgroup of translations). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse. To explain accurately the relationship between affine and Euclidean geometry, we now need to pin down the group of Euclidean geometry within the affine group. The Euclidean group is in fact (using the previous description of the affine group) the semi- direct product of the orthogonal (rotation and reflection) group with the translations. (See Klein geometry for more details.) Influence on later work The long-term effects of the Erlangen program can be seen all over pure mathematics (see tacit use at congruence (geometry), for example); and the idea of transformations and of synthesis using groups of symmetry has become standard in physics. When topology is routinely described in terms of properties invariant under homeomorphism, one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases ‚Äì and not Lie groups ‚Äì but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by H.S.M. Coxeter routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became transformation geometry, a mixed blessing in the sense that it builds on stronger intuitions than the style of Euclid, but is less easily converted into a logical system. In his book Structuralism (1970) Jean Piaget says, \\"In the eyes of contemporary structuralist mathematicians, like Bourbaki, the Erlangen Program amounts to only a partial victory for structuralism, since they want to subordinate all mathematics, not just geometry, to the idea of structure.\\" For a geometry and its group, an element of the group is sometimes called a motion of the geometry. For example, one can learn about the Poincar√© half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry through a development based on hyperbolic motions. Such a development enables one to methodically prove the ultraparallel theorem by successive motions. Abstract returns from the Erlangen program Quite often, it appears there are two or more distinct geometries with isomorphic automorphism groups. There arises the question of reading the Erlangen program from the abstract group, to the geometry. One example: oriented (i.e., reflections not included) elliptic geometry (i.e., the surface of an n-sphere with opposite points identified) and oriented spherical geometry (the same non-Euclidean geometry, but with opposite points not identified) have isomorphic automorphism group, SO(n+1) for even n. These may appear to be distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, in a way that can be made precise. To take another example, elliptic geometries with different radii of curvature have isomorphic automorphism groups. That does not really count as a critique as all such geometries are isomorphic. General Riemannian geometry falls outside the boundaries of the program. Complex, dual and double (aka split-complex) numbers appear as homogeneous spaces SL(2,R)/H for the group SL(2,R) and its subgroups H=A, N, K. The group SL(2,R) acts on these homogeneous spaces by linear fractional transformations and a large portion of the respective geometries can be obtained in a uniform way from the Erlangen programme. Some further notable examples have come up in physics. Firstly, n-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, n-dimensional de Sitter space and (n‚àí1)-dimensional inversive geometry all have isomorphic automorphism groups, :\\\\mathrm{O}(n,1)/\\\\mathrm{C}_2,\\\\ the orthochronous Lorentz group, for . But these are apparently distinct geometries. Here some interesting results enter, from the physics. It has been shown that physics models in each of the three geometries are \\"dual\\" for some models. Again, n-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and (n‚àí1)-dimensional conformal space with \\"Lorentzian\\" signature (in contrast with conformal space with \\"Euclidean\\" signature, which is identical to inversive geometry, for three dimensions or greater) have isomorphic automorphism groups, but are distinct geometries. Once again, there are models in physics with \\"dualities\\" between both spaces. See AdS/CFT for more details. The covering group of SU(2,2) is isomorphic to the covering group of SO(4,2), which is the symmetry group of a 4D conformal Minkowski space and a 5D anti-de Sitter space and a complex four-dimensional twistor space. The Erlangen program can therefore still be considered fertile, in relation with dualities in physics. In the seminal paper which introduced categories, Saunders Mac Lane and Samuel Eilenberg stated: \\"This may be regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlanger Program, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings\\"S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane, A general theory of natural equivalences, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 58:231‚Äì294, 1945.

Classical geometry Symmetry Group theory Homogeneous spaces Erlangen ","title":"Erlangen program"},{"id":"243387","text":"Disulfiram (sold under the trade name Antabuse) is a drug used to support the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (drinking alcohol). Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing many of the effects of a hangover to be felt immediately following alcohol consumption. Disulfiram plus alcohol, even small amounts, produces flushing, throbbing in the head and neck, a throbbing headache, respiratory difficulty, nausea, copious vomiting, sweating, thirst, chest pain, palpitation, dyspnea, hyperventilation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, fainting, marked uneasiness, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, and confusion. In severe reactions there may be respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack, acute congestive heart failure, unconsciousness, convulsions, and death. In the body, alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is then broken down by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. When the dehydrogenase enzyme is inhibited, acetaldehyde builds up, causing unpleasant side effects. Disulfiram should be used in conjunction with counseling and support. Disulfiram has been studied as a possible treatment for cancer and latent HIV infection. Alcohol dependence Disulfiram is used as a second line treatment, behind acamprosate and naltrexone, for alcohol dependence. Under normal metabolism, alcohol is broken down in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, which is then converted by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to a harmless acetic acid derivative (acetyl coenzyme A). Disulfiram blocks this reaction at the intermediate stage by blocking acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. After alcohol intake under the influence of disulfiram, the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood may be five to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone. As acetaldehyde is one of the major causes of the symptoms of a \\"hangover\\", this produces immediate and severe negative reaction to alcohol intake. About 5 to 10 minutes after alcohol intake, the patient may experience the effects of a severe hangover for a period of 30 minutes up to several hours. Symptoms include flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, throbbing headache, visual disturbance, mental confusion, postural syncope, and circulatory collapse. Disulfiram should not be taken if alcohol has been consumed in the last 12 hours. There is no tolerance to disulfiram: the longer it is taken, the stronger its effects. As disulfiram is absorbed slowly through the digestive tract and eliminated slowly by the body, the effects may last for up to two weeks after the initial intake; consequently, medical ethics dictate that patients must be fully informed about the disulfiram- alcohol reaction. Disulfiram does not reduce alcohol cravings, so a major problem associated with this drug is extremely poor compliance. Methods to improve compliance include subdermal implants, which release the drug continuously over a period of up to 12 weeks, and supervised administration practices, for example, having the drug regularly administered by one's spouse. Although disulfiram remained the most common pharmaceutical treatment of alcohol abuse until the end of the 20th century, today it is often replaced or accompanied with newer drugs, primarily the combination of naltrexone and acamprosate, which directly attempt to address physiological processes in the brain associated with alcohol abuse. Side effects in absence of alcohol The most common side effects in the absence of alcohol are headache, and a metallic or garlic taste in the mouth, though more severe side effects may occur. Tryptophol, a chemical compound that induces sleep in humans, is formed in the liver after disulfiram treatment. Less common side effects include decrease in libido, liver problems, skin rash, and nerve inflammation. Liver toxicity is an uncommon but potentially serious side effect, and risk groups e.g. those with already impaired liver function should be monitored closely. That said, the rate of disulfiram-induced hepatitis are estimated to be in between 1 per 25,000 to 1 in 30,000, and rarely the primary cause for treatment cessation. Cases of disulfiram neurotoxicity have also occurred, causing extrapyramidal and other symptoms. Disulfiram (Antabuse) can produce neuropathy in daily doses of less than the usually recommended 500 mg. Nerve biopsies showed axonal degeneration and the neuropathy is difficult to distinguish from that associated with ethanol abuse. Disulfiram neuropathy occurs after a variable latent period (mean 5 to 6 months) and progresses steadily. Slow improvement may occur when the drug's use is stopped; often there is complete recovery eventually. Disulfiram disrupts metabolism of several other compounds, including paracetamol (acetaminophen), theophylline and caffeine. However, in most cases, this disruption is mild and presents itself as a 20‚Äì40% increase in the half-life of the compound at typical dosages of disulfiram. Similarly acting substances In medicine, the term \\"disulfiram effect\\" refers to an adverse effect of a particular medication in causing an unpleasant hypersensitivity to alcohol, similar to the effect caused by disulfiram administration. Examples: * Antibiotics (nitroimidazoles), e.g. metronidazole * First-generation sulfonylureas, e.g. tolbutamide and chlorpropamide * Several cephalosporin drugs, including cefoperazone, cefamandole and cefotetan, that have a N-methylthio-tetrazole moiety * Griseofulvin, an oral antifungal drug * Procarbazine * Temposil, or citrated calcium carbimide, has the same function as disulfiram, but is weaker and safer. * Coprine, which metabolizes to 1-aminocyclopropanol, a chemical having the same metabolic effects as disulfiram. It occurs naturally in the otherwise edible common ink cap mushroom (Coprinopsis atramentaria), hence its colloquial name \\"tippler's bane\\". Similar reactions have been recorded with Clitocybe clavipes and Suillellus luridus, although the agent in those species is unknown. History The synthesis of disulfiram, originally known as tetraethylthiuram disulfide, was first reported in 1881. By around 1900, it was introduced to the industrial process of Sulfur vulcanization of rubber and became widely used. In 1937 a rubber factory doctor in the US published a paper noting that workers exposed to disulfiram had negative reactions to alcohol and could be used as a drug for alcoholism; the effects were also noticed in workers at Swedish rubber boot factory. In the early 1940s it had been tested as a treatment for scabies, a parasitic skin infection, as well as intestinal worms. Around that time, during the German occupation of Denmark, Erik Jacobsen and Jens Hald at the Danish drug company Medicinalco picked up on that research and began exploring the use of disulfiram to treat intestinal parasites. The company had a group of enthusiastic self-experimenters that called itself the \\"Death Battalion\\", and in the course of testing the drug on themselves, accidentally discovered that drinking alcohol while the drug was still in their bodies made them mildly sick. They made that discovery in 1945, and did nothing with it until two years later, when Jacobsen gave an impromptu talk and mentioned this self-experimental work and Disulframs nausea inducing effects when combined with alcohol, this talk which was discussed afterwards in newspapers at the time, lead them to further explore the use of the drug for aversive-reaction based therapy for the treatment of alcohol abuse. That work included small clinical trials with Oluf Martensen-Larsen, a doctor who worked with alcoholics. They published their work starting in 1948. The chemists at Medicinalco discovered a new form of disulfiram while trying to purify a batch that had been contaminated with copper. This form turned out to have better pharmacological properties, and the company patented it and used that form for the product that was introduced as Antabus (later anglicized to Antabuse). This work led to renewed study of the human metabolism of ethanol. It was already known that ethanol was mostly metabolized in the liver, with it being converted first to acetaldehyde and then acetaldehyde to acetic acid and carbon dioxide, but the enzymes involved were not known. By 1950 the work led to the knowledge that ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and that disulfiram works by inhibiting ALDH, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde, which is what causes the negative effects in the body. The drug was first marketed in Denmark and as of 2008 Denmark was the country where it was most widely prescribed. It was approved by the FDA in 1951. The FDA later approved other drugs for treatment of alcohol use disorder, namely naltrexone in 1994 and acamprosate in 2004. Cancer When disulfiram creates complexes with metals (dithiocarbamate complexes), it is a proteasome inhibitor and as of 2016 it had been studied in in vitro experiments, model animals, and small clinical trials as a possible treatment for liver metastasis, metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. Various clinical trials of copper depletion agents have been carried out. HIV Disulfiram has also been identified by systematic high-throughput screening as a potential HIV latency reversing agent (LRA). Reactivation of latent HIV infection in patients is part of an investigational strategy known as \\"shock and kill\\" which may be able to reduce or eliminate the HIV reservoir. Recent phase II dose-escalation studies in patients with HIV who are controlled on antiretroviral therapy have observed an increase in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA with increasing exposure to disulfiram and its metabolites. Disulfiram is also being investigated in combination with vorinostat, another investigational latency reversing agent, to treat HIV. Occupational safety  Though the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the US has not set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for disulfiram in the workplace, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2 mg/m3 and recommended that workers avoid concurrent exposure to ethylene dibromide.

It refers to the physical or psychological proximity between people. Propinquity can mean physical proximity, a kinship between people, or a similarity in nature between things (\\"like-attracts-like\\"). Two people living on the same floor of a building, for example, have a higher propinquity than those living on different floors, just as two people with similar political beliefs possess a higher propinquity than those whose beliefs strongly differ. Propinquity is also one of the factors, set out by Jeremy Bentham, used to measure the amount of (utilitarian) pleasure in a method known as felicific calculus. Propinquity effect The propinquity effect is the tendency for people to form friendships or romantic relationships with those whom they encounter often, forming a bond between subject and friend. Workplace interactions are frequent and this frequent interaction is often a key indicator as to why close relationships can readily form in this type of environment.Marvin, D. M., (1919). Occupational propinquity as a factor in marriage selection, University of Pennsylvania. In other words, relationships tend to form between those who have a high propinquity. It was first theorized by psychologists Leon Festinger, Stanley Schachter, and Kurt Back in what came to be called the Westgate studies conducted at MIT (1950).Festinger, L., Schachter, S., Back, K., (1950) \\"The Spatial Ecology of Group Formation\\", in L. Festinger, S. Schachter, & K. Back (eds.), Social Pressure in Informal Groups, 1950. Chapter 4. The typical Euler diagram used to represent the propinquity effect is shown below where U = universe, A = set A, B = set B, and S = similarity: center The sets are basically any relevant subject matter about a person, persons, or non-persons, depending on the context. Propinquity can be more than just physical distance. Residents of an apartment building living near a stairway, for example, tend to have more friends from other floors than those living further from the stairway. The propinquity effect is usually explained by the mere exposure effect, which holds that the more exposure a stimulus gets, the more likeable it becomes. There is a requirement for the mere exposure effect to influence the propinquity effect, and that is that the exposure is positive. If the resident has repeatedly negative experiences with a person then the propinquity effect has a far less chance of happening (Norton, Frost, & Ariely, 2007).Norton, M. I., & Ariely, D. (2007). Less is more: The lure of ambiguity, or why familiarity breeds contempt. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92, 97-105. In a study on interpersonal attraction (Piercey and Piercey, 1972), 23 graduate psychology students, all from the same class, underwent 9 hours of sensitivity training in two groups. Students were given pre- and post-tests to rate their positive and negative attitudes toward each class member. Members of the same sensitivity training group rated each other higher in the post-test than they rated members of the other group in both the pre- and post-test, and members of their own group in the pre-test. The results indicated that the 9 hours of sensitivity training increased the exposure of students in the same group to each other, and thus they became more likeable to each other.Piercy, F. P., & Piercy, S. K. (1972). Interpersonal attraction as a function of propinquity in two sensitivity groups. Psychology: A Journal of Human Behavior, 9(1), 27‚Äì30. Propinquity is one of the effects used to study group dynamics. For example, there was a British study done on immigrant Irish women to observe how they interacted with their new environments (Ryan, 2007). This study showed that there were certain people with whom these women became friends much more easily than others, such as classmates, workplace colleagues, and neighbours as a result of shared interests, common situations, and constant interaction. For women who still felt out of place when they began life in a new place, giving birth to children allowed for different ties to be formed, ones with other mothers. Having slightly older children participating in activities such as school clubs and teams also allowed social networks to widen, giving the women a stronger support base, emotional or otherwise. Types Various types of propinquity exist, varying from Industry/Occupational Propinquity, in which similar people working in the same field or job tend to be attracted to one another.Martin, Donald M. (1918). Occupational Propinquity as a Factor in Marriage Selection, Vol 16, No.123, pp. 131‚Äì150. American Statistical Association. Residential Propinquity, in which people living in the same area or within neighborhoods of each other tend to come together.Bossard, James H.S.(1932). Residential Propinquity as a factor in Marriage Selection, Vol 38, No.2, pp. 219‚Äì224. American Journal of Sociology. Acquaintance Propinquity, a form of proximity in existence when friends tend to have a special bond of interpersonal attraction. Many studies have been performed in assessing various propinquities and their effect on marriage. Virtual propinquity The introduction of instant messaging and video conferencing has reduced the effects of propinquity. Online interactions have facilitated instant and close interactions with people despite a lack of material presence. This allows a notional \\"virtual propinquity\\" to work on virtual relationships where people are connected virtually.Perry, Martha W.(2006). Instant messaging: virtual propinquity for health promotion networking, 211‚Äì2 However, research that came after the development of the internet and email has shown that physical distance is still a powerful predictor of contact, interaction, friendship, and influence.Latane, B., Liu, J.

By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology. The term \\"knowledge\\" can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); formal or informal; systematic or particular. The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus, leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\"., Chapter 7, pp. 95‚Äì101. The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century.  Theories of knowledge  Robert Reid, Knowledge (1896). Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C. Knowledge is the primary subject of the field of epistemology, which studies what we know, how we come to know it, and what it means to know something. The definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among epistemologists. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by Plato,In Plato's Theaetetus, Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of knowledge: knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account. Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory. specifies that a statement must meet three criteria in order to be considered knowledge: it must be justified, true, and believed. Epistemologists today generally agree that these conditions are not sufficient, as various Gettier cases are thought to demonstrate. There are a number of alternative definitions which have been proposed, including Robert Nozick's proposal that all instances of knowledge must 'track the truth' and Simon Blackburn's proposal that those who have a justified true belief 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' fail to have knowledge. Richard Kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth. jstor In contrast to this approach, Ludwig Wittgenstein observed, following Moore's paradox, that one can say \\"He believes it, but it isn't so,\\" but not \\"He knows it, but it isn't so.\\"Ludwig Wittgenstein, On Certainty, remark 42 He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to know that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way \\"knowledge\\" is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a family resemblance. Following this idea, \\"knowledge\\" has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition.Gottschalk-Mazouz, N. (2008): \\"Internet and the flow of knowledge,\\" in: Hrachovec, H.; Pichler, A. (Hg.): Philosophy of the Information Society. Proceedings of the 30. International Ludwig Wittgenstein Symposium Kirchberg am Wechsel, Austria 2007. Volume 2, Frankfurt, Paris, Lancaster, New Brunswik: Ontos, S. 215‚Äì232.  Self-knowledge  ‚ÄúSelf-knowledge‚Äù usually refers to a person's knowledge of their own sensations, thoughts, beliefs, and other mental states. A number of questions regarding self-knowledge have been the subject of extensive debates in philosophy, including whether self-knowledge differs from other types of knowledge, whether we have privileged self- knowledge compared to knowledge of other minds, and the nature of our acquaintance with ourselves. David Hume famously expressed skepticism about whether we could ever have self-knowledge over and above our immediate awareness of a \\"bundle of perceptions\\", which was part of his broader skepticism about personal identity.  The value of knowledge  Los portadores de la antorcha (The Torch-Bearers) ‚Äì Sculpture by Anna Hyatt Huntington symbolizing the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next (Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain) We generally assume that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If so, what is the explanation? A formulation of the value problem in epistemology first occurs in Plato's Meno. Socrates points out to Meno that a man who knew the way to Larissa could lead others there correctly. But so, too, could a man who had true beliefs about how to get there, even if he had not gone there or had any knowledge of Larissa. Socrates says that it seems that both knowledge and true opinion can guide action. Meno then wonders why knowledge is valued more than true belief and why knowledge and true belief are different. Socrates responds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief because it is tethered or justified. Justification, or working out the reason for a true belief, locks down true belief. The problem is to identify what (if anything) makes knowledge more valuable than mere true belief, or that makes knowledge more valuable than a mere minimal conjunction of its components, such as justification, safety, sensitivity, statistical likelihood, and anti-Gettier conditions, on a particular analysis of knowledge that conceives of knowledge as divided into components (to which knowledge-first epistemological theories, which posit knowledge as fundamental, are notable exceptions). The value problem re-emerged in the philosophical literature on epistemology in the twenty-first century following the rise of virtue epistemology in the 1980s, partly because of the obvious link to the concept of value in ethics. In contemporary philosophy, epistemologists including Ernest Sosa, John Greco, Jonathan Kvanvig, Linda Zagzebski, and Duncan Pritchard have defended virtue epistemology as a solution to the value problem. They argue that epistemology should also evaluate the \\"properties\\" of people as epistemic agents (i.e. intellectual virtues), rather than merely the properties of propositions and propositional mental attitudes.  Scientific knowledge  Sir Francis Bacon, \\"Knowledge is Power\\" The development of the scientific method has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning and experimentation.\\"[4] Rules for the study of natural philosophy\\", , from the General Scholium, which follows Book 3, The System of the World. The scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.scientific method, Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of philosophy. As science itself has developed, scientific knowledge now includes a broader usage in the soft sciences such as biology and the social sciences ‚Äì discussed elsewhere as meta-epistemology, or genetic epistemology, and to some extent related to \\"theory of cognitive development\\". Note that \\"epistemology\\" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is \\"the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.\\" Sir Francis Bacon was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, \\"knowledge is power\\", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597). Until recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans ‚Äì and probably adult humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to Society-as-such, as in (e. g.) \\"the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture\\" (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider unconscious knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by Freud.There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains ‚Äì e. g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed Space and Time as axiomatically \\"transcendental\\" and \\"a priori\\" ‚Äì a claim later disproved by Piaget's clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of \\"infinite regress\\" can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are actually developed, both during infantile learning and as inherited \\"pseudo-transcendentals\\" inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations. See also \\"Tacit knowledge\\". * Piaget, J., and B.Inhelder (1927/1969). The child's conception of time. Routledge & Kegan Paul: London. * Piaget, J., and B. Inhelder (1948/1956). The child's conception of space. Routledge & Kegan Paul: London. Other biological domains where \\"knowledge\\" might be said to reside, include: (iii) the immune system, and (iv) in the DNA of the genetic code. See the list of four \\"epistemological domains\\": Popper, (1975);Popper, K.R. (1975). \\"The rationality of scientific revolutions\\"; in Rom Harr√© (ed.), Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences. Clarendon Press: Oxford. and Traill (2008: Table S, p. 31) ‚Äì also references by both to Niels Jerne. Such considerations seem to call for a separate definition of \\"knowledge\\" to cover the biological systems. For biologists, knowledge must be usefully available to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be: * The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book on its own). * The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of \\"the outside world\\",This \\"outside world\\" could include other subsystems within the same organism ‚Äì e. g. different \\"mental levels\\" corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See Theory of cognitive development. or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly). * Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful. Those who use the phrase \\"scientific knowledge\\" don't necessary claim to certainty, since scientists will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper scientific method that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the truth in general.  Situated knowledge  Situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation. It was used by Donna Haraway as an extension of the feminist approaches of \\"successor science\\" suggested by Sandra Harding, one which \\"offers a more adequate, richer, better account of a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our own as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions.\\"\\"Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective\\". Haraway, Donna. Feminist Studies Vol. 14, No. 3. pp. 575‚Äì599. 1988. This situation partially transforms science into a narrative, which Arturo Escobar explains as, \\"neither fictions nor supposed facts.\\" This narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction, and as Escobar explains further, \\"even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense,\\" insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency, \\"it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way, without succumbing to its mystification as 'the truth' or to the ironic skepticism common to many critiques.\\"\\"Introduction: Development and the Anthropology of Modernity\\". Escobar, Arturo. Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World. Haraway's argument stems from the limitations of the human perception, as well as the overemphasis of the sense of vision in science. According to Haraway, vision in science has been, \\"used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere.\\" This is the \\"gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation.\\" This causes a limitation of views in the position of science itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge, resulting in a position of \\"modest witness\\". This is what Haraway terms a \\"god trick\\", or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation.Chapter 1. Haraway, Donna. Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium. FemaleMan¬© Meets_OncoMouse2. Feminism and Technoscience. 1997. In order to avoid this, \\"Haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the subject in terms of both ethical and political accountability\\". Some methods of generating knowledge, such as trial and error, or learning from experience, tend to create highly situational knowledge. Situational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions. This integration of situational knowledge is an allusion to the community, and its attempts at collecting subjective perspectives into an embodiment \\"of views from somewhere.\\" Knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of acknowledgement in human beings.Stanley Cavell, \\"Knowing and Acknowledging\\", Must We Mean What We Say? (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 238‚Äì266. Even though Haraway's arguments are largely based on feminist studies, this idea of different worlds, as well as the skeptic stance of situated knowledge is present in the main arguments of post-structuralism. Fundamentally, both argue the contingency of knowledge on the presence of history; power, and geography, as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures; and the idea of power as an inherited trait of objectification.\\"The Subject and Power\\". Foucault, Michel. Critical Inquiry Volume 9, No. 4. pp. 777‚Äì795. 1982  Partial knowledge  The parable of the blind men and the elephant suggests that people tend to project their partial experiences as the whole truth One discipline of epistemology focuses on partial knowledge. In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always incomplete or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them. This idea is also present in the concept of bounded rationality which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.  Religious accounts of knowledge  In many expressions of Christianity, such as Catholicism and Anglicanism, knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. The Old Testament's tree of the knowledge of good and evil contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: \\"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil...\\" () In Gnosticism, divine knowledge or gnosis is hoped to be attained. ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§® (Vidya Daan) i.e. knowledge sharing is a major part of Daan, a tenet of all Dharmic Religions. Hindu Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, Paroksh Gyan and Prataksh Gyan. Paroksh Gyan (also spelled Paroksha-Jnana) is secondhand knowledge: knowledge obtained from books, hearsay, etc. Pratyaksh Gyan (also spelled Pratyaksha-Jnana) is the knowledge borne of direct experience, i.e., knowledge that one discovers for oneself. Jnana yoga (\\"path of knowledge\\") is one of three main types of yoga expounded by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. (It is compared and contrasted with Bhakti Yoga and Karma yoga.) In Islam, knowledge (Arabic: ÿπŸÑŸÖ,  øilm) is given great significance. \\"The Knowing\\" (al- øAlƒ´m) is one of the 99 names reflecting distinct attributes of God. The Qur'an asserts that knowledge comes from God () and various hadith encourage the acquisition of knowledge. Muhammad is reported to have said \\"Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave\\" and \\"Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets\\". Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title alim, meaning \\"knowledgeble\\". In Jewish tradition, knowledge (Hebrew: ◊ì◊¢◊™ da'ath) is considered one of the most valuable traits a person can acquire. Observant Jews recite three times a day in the Amidah \\"Favor us with knowledge, understanding and discretion that come from you. Exalted are you, Existent- One, the gracious giver of knowledge.\\" The Tanakh states, \\"A wise man gains power, and a man of knowledge maintains power\\", and \\"knowledge is chosen above gold\\".

Painting by Christen Dalsgaard. From the Hirschsprung Collection, Denmark. In the case of uncertainty, expectation is event that considered the most likely to happen. An expectation, which is a belief that is centered on the future, may or may not be realistic. A less advantageous result gives rise to the emotion of disappointment. If something happens that is not at all expected, it is a surprise. An expectation about the behavior or performance of another person, expressed to that person, may have the nature of a strong request, or an order; this kind of expectation is called a social norm. The degree to which something is expected to be true can be expressed using fuzzy logic. Expectations of well-being Richard Lazarus asserts that people become accustomed to positive or negative life experiences which lead to favorable or unfavorable expectations of their present and near-future circumstances. Lazarus notes the widely accepted philosophical principle that \\"happiness depends on the background psychological status of the person...and cannot be well predicted without reference to one's expectations.\\" With regard to happiness or unhappiness, Lazarus notes that objective conditions of life are those of hardship and deprivation often make a positive assessment of their well-being,\\" while \\"people who are objectively well off...often make a negative assessment of their well-being.\\" Lazarus argues that \\"the most sensible explanation of this apparent paradox is that people...develop favorable or unfavorable expectations\\" that guide such assessments. Expectations impact on beliefs Sociologist Robert K. Merton wrote that a person's expectation is directly linked to self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether or not such an expectation is truthful or not, has little or no effect on the outcome. If a person believes what they are told or convinces himself/herself of the fact, chances are this person will see the expectation to its inevitable conclusion. There is an inherent danger in this kind of labeling especially for the educator. Since children are easily convinced of certain tenets especially when told to them by an authority figure like a parent or teacher, they may believe whatever is taught to them even if what is taught has no factual basis. If the student or child were to act on false information, certain positive or negative unintended consequences could result. If overly positive or elevated expectations were used to describe or manipulate a person's self-image and execution falls short, the results could be a total reversal of that person's self-confidence. If thought of in terms of causality or cause and effect, the higher a person's expectation and the lower the execution, the higher the frustration level may become. This in turn could cause a total cessation of effort and motivate the person to quit.  Expectations elicitation  Expectations are a central part of value calculations in economics. For example, calculating the Subjective expected utility of an outcome requires knowing both the value of an outcome and the probability that it will occur. Researchers who elicit (or measure) the expectations of individuals can input these beliefs into the model in place of standard probabilities. The strategy of eliciting individual expectations is now incorporated into many international surveys, including the Health and Retirement Study in the United States. Expectations elicitation is used in many domains, including survival and educational outcomes, but may be most prominent in financial realms. Expectations are theoretically important for models such as the Efficient-market hypothesis which suggest that all information should be incorporated into the market, as well as for Modern portfolio theory which suggests that investors must be compensated for higher levels of risk through higher (expected) returns. Following these models, empirical research has found that consumers with more optimistic stock market expectations are more likely to hold riskier assets, and acquire stocks in the near future. Given these promising findings, more recent research in psychology has begun to explore what factors drive consumers' expectations by exploring what factors come to mind when forming stock market expectations.

Its primary focus is on providing a relatively accessible development tool set and scripting language that enable the creation of software programs that run across multiple platforms with little or no code modifications. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) included with Revolution is built partly on the models created by Bill Atkinson and the original HyperCard team at Apple and subsequently followed by many other software development products, such as Microsoft's Visual Basic. Revolution includes an English language-like scripting language called Transcript, a full programming language superset of the HyperCard's scripting language, HyperTalk. The higher-grade versions (see Versions, below), allow applications to be compiled to run on more than one platform, including Macintosh (Classic or Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X), Windows and Unix-like systems including Linux. It can also import HyperCard stacks, which require little or no modification unless they use external functions, which generally do not work in Revolution. Revolution is designed to be an environment where non-programmers feel at ease and programmers feel not too uncomfortable (after getting used to \\"non-traditional\\" programming syntax). Like any programming language or development environment, opinions as to the degree to which those aims have been achieved vary greatly.  Versions  Before Revolution 2, the \\"Starter Kit\\" version was available. This was freeware and imposed restrictions on the user, such as not allowing scripts longer than ten lines to be compiled. However, this has since been discontinued and is no longer available for download. The \\"Dreamcard\\" version is intended for home users/hobbyists. Applications (called \\"stacks\\") built using it require either the \\"Dreamcard Player\\" or a full copy of Revolution to run because Dreamcard does not include the Revolution compiler. The \\"Studio\\" version is more powerful, and is useful in creating professional binary applications. The Enterprise version is probably too expensive for casual users, but when compared to other similar products such as Borland Delphi or Kylix, is priced competitively. If one wishes to develop programs on non- Microsoft platforms for cross-platform deployment, Revolution is one of a small handful of commercially supported options.  Compatibility  Revolution is derived from MetaCard's engine, so MetaCard stacks are 100% compatible with Revolution. However, the other way around is not necessarily true. HyperCard stacks can be run, but externals will only run on Macs. SuperCard stacks must be run through a converter to be upgraded to Revolution/MetaCard format.  Platforms  Revolution runs on Mac Classic, Mac OS X, Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP, and the following UNIX variants: *FreeBSD or BSD/OS *HP-UX 10.20 or later *SGI IRIX 5.3 or later *Linux Intel 1.2.13 ELF or later *AIX 3.2.3 or later *Solaris (2.5 or later for SPARC and x86; 2.3 and 2.4 SPARC only) *SunOS 4.1.x or later Standalone applications written in Revolution can run on the above, as well as Windows 3.1 (with limitations). As of March 2005, the Dreamcard Player runs only on Windows, Mac OS (Classic or X), and Linux.  Interface  On Linux, the user's GNOME/Xfce/GTK+ theme will be used if GTK+ is installed, otherwise, a Motif look will be used. On the Mac, Appearance Manager will be used if available, otherwise the Platinum look will be used. On Windows, the XP theme or standard widgets will be used. Users can preview the Motif, Platinum, and Windows appearance on any platform.  Revolution community  There are many companies and groups which use the Revolution engine.

Miscellanea The first claimed sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the River Ness in AD 565, when Saint Columba is said to have banished a \\"water monster\\" back into the river after it tried to attack one of his disciples who was swimming across the river.Life of Saint Columba written by Adamnan, Ninth Abbot of that Monastery, ed. William Reeves, 1874 Book 2 Chapter 28 According to Adomn√°n, when Columba visited King Bridei I of Pictland at his house on the River Ness, he met a wizard named Broichan who had an Irish slave-girl that he refused to release even though Columba pleaded with him. Columba went out of Bridei's house and picked up a white pebble from the river. He said that the pebble would be used to heal many sick people in Pictland, and that Broichan was suffering for his sins at that very moment. After he had finished speaking, two messengers came to tell them that Broichan had a seizure and they wanted Columba to help them. Columba gave them the stone and said to dip it in water to give to Broichan, if he agreed to release the slave-girl. He agreed to do so, and the stone was put in water and it floated on it; the wizard drank from the water and was healed. This stone was kept by King Bridei in the royal treasury for the rest of his life, and anyone who came there for healing would be given water with the stone floating in it, and they would be healed.Adomnan of Iona.

The canal was constructed in the early nineteenth century by Scottish engineer Thomas Telford. Route The canal runs some from northeast to southwest and reaches 106 feet above sea level. Only one third of the entire length is man-made, the rest being formed by Loch Dochfour, Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy. These lochs are located in the Great Glen, on a geological fault in the Earth's crust. There are 29 locks (including eight at Neptune's Staircase, Banavie), four aqueducts and 10 bridges in the course of the canal. History In 1620, a Highland prophet called the Brahan Seer predicted that full-rigged ships would one day be sailing round the back of Tomnahurick, near Inverness, at a time when the only navigable route near the location was the River Ness, on the other side of Tomnahurick. Engineers started to look at the feasibility of a canal to connect Loch Linnhe near Fort William to the Moray Firth near Inverness in the 18th century, with Captain Edward Burt rejecting the idea in 1726, as he thought the mountains would channel the wind and make navigation too precarious. The Commissioners of Forfeited Estates had originally been set up to handle the seizure and sale of land previously owned by those who had been convicted of treason following the Jacobite rising of 1715. By 1773, they had turned their attention to helping the fishing industry, and commissioned the inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt to make a survey of the route. He published a report in 1774, which suggested that a canal from Fort William to Inverness, passing through Loch Lochy, Loch Oich, Loch Ness and Loch Dochfour, would require 32 locks, and could be built for ¬£164,032. He emphasised the benefits to the fishing industry, of a shorter and safer route from the east to the west coast of Scotland, and the potential for supplying the population with cheaper corn, but again, thought that winds on the lochs might be a problem. Although no action was taken at the time, in 1785 John Knox expounded the benefits of it relieving distress in the Highlands, and preventing ships having to navigate the dangerous Pentland Firth between the Orkney Islands and Caithness. William Fraser, when proposing his own scheme for a canal in 1793, announced that \\"nature had finished more than half of it already\\". At the time, much of the Highlands were depressed as a result of the Highland Clearances, which had deprived many of their homes and jobs. Laws had been introduced which sought to eradicate the local culture, including bans on wearing tartan, playing the bagpipes, and speaking Scottish Gaelic. Many emigrated to Canada or elsewhere, or moved to the Scottish Lowlands. The engineer Thomas Telford was asked to investigate the problem of emigration in 1801, and in 1802 published his report, which suggested that the problem was caused by landowners who had previously kept cattle creating vast sheep-farms. Realising that direct government action to tackle the issue would be seen as interference, he therefore suggested that a programme of public works, involving roads, bridges and canals, would be a way to provide jobs for people who had been displaced by the sheep farming, and to stimulate industry, fishery and agriculture. Telford consulted widely with shipowners, who favoured a canal instead of the hazardous journey around the north of Scotland via Cape Wrath and the Pentland Firth. He obtained advice from Captain Gwynn of the Royal Navy, who stated that Loch Ness and Loch Lochy were sufficiently deep for any size of boat, and had safe anchorages if winds proved to be a problem, but that Loch Oich would need to be made deeper, as it was shallow in places. He established that Loch Garry, to the west of Invergarry, and Loch Quoich, beyond that, would provide an adequate water supply. He estimated that a canal suitable for ships with a draught of could be built in seven years, and would cost around ¬£350,000. An additional benefit would be the protection that the canal offered to shipping from attacks by French privateers. Telford also looked at the possibility of a canal to link Loch Eil to Loch Shiel, both to the west of Fort William, but ruled out the scheme because of the depth of cuttings that would have been required. =Construction= On 27 July 1803, an Act of Parliament was passed to authorise the project, and carried the title: An Act for granting to his Majesty the Sum of ¬£20,000, towards defraying the Expense of making an Inland Navigation from the western to the eastern Sea, by Inverness and Fort William; and for taking the necessary steps towards executing the same. The Act appointed Commissioners, to oversee the project, and some funding to enable the work to start. Less than a year later, on 29 June 1804, the Commissioners obtained a second Act of Parliament, which granted them ¬£50,000 per year of government money, payable in two instalments, to fund the ongoing work. Provision was made for private investors to buy shares in the scheme, for any amount over ¬£50, and as well as building the main line of the canal, the engineers could alter Loch Garry, Loch Quoich and Loch Arkaig, to improve their function as reservoirs. Telford was asked to survey, design and build the waterway. He worked with William Jessop on the survey, and the two men oversaw the construction until Jessop died in 1814. The canal was expected to take seven years to complete, and to cost ¬£474,000, to be funded by the Government, but both estimates were inadequate. Because of the remoteness of the location, construction was started at both ends, so that completed sections could be used to bring in the materials for the middle sections. As Thomas Telford could only visit the work about twice a year, he appointed Matthew Davidson, like Telford, a Dumfrieshire stonemason, to manage the work at the east end. John Telford, who is thought not to have been related to Thomas, was to manage the difficult western end. The work was to prove a serious challenge to John Telford's health and he died in 1807, to be replaced by Alexander Easton. John Telford was buried in Kilmallie churchyard, where his ornate grave, now in dilapidated condition, can still be seen. Grave of John Telford, Kilmallie churchyard Inscription on John Telford's grave. At Corpach, near Fort William, the entrance lock was built on rock, but at the other end, there was of mud below the proposed site of the sea lock. Rock was tipped on top of the mud and was allowed to settle for six months before construction could begin. The ground through which the canal was cut was variable, and further difficulties were experienced with the construction of the locks, the largest ever built at the time. There were also problems with the labour force, with high levels of absence, particularly during and after the potato harvest and the peat cutting season. This led to Telford bringing in Irish navvies to manage the shortfall, which led to further criticism, since one of the main aims of the project was to reduce unemployment in the Highlands. The canal finally opened in 1822, having taken an extra 12 years to complete, and cost ¬£910,000. Over 3,000 local people had been employed in its construction, but the draught had been reduced from in an effort to save costs. In the meantime, shipbuilding had advanced, with the introduction of steam-powered iron-hulled ships, many of which were now too big to use the canal. The Royal Navy did not need to use the canal either, as Napoleon had been defeated at Waterloo in 1815, and the perceived threat to shipping when the canal was started was now gone. Operation Before long, defects in some of the materials used became apparent, and part of Corpach double lock collapsed in 1843. This led to a decision to close the canal to allow repairs to be carried out, and the depth was increased to at the same time. The work was designed by Telford's associate James Walker, carried out by Jackson and Bean of Aston, Birmingham and completed between 1843 and 1847 at a cost of ¬£136,089. However, not all of the traffic expected to return to using the canal did so. Commercially, the venture was not a success, but the dramatic scenery through which it passes led to it becoming a tourist attraction. Queen Victoria took a trip along it in 1873, and the publicity surrounding the trip resulted in a large increase in visitors to the region and the canal. The arrival of the railways at Fort William, Fort Augustus and Inverness did little to harm the canal, as trains were scheduled to connect with steamboat services. There was an upsurge in commercial traffic during the First World War, when components for the construction of mines were shipped through the canal on their way from America to \\"U.S. Naval Base 18‚Äù (Muirtown Basin, Inverness), and fishing boats used it to avoid possible enemy action on the longer route around the north of Scotland. During this period there was 24-hour operation, facilitated by buoyage and lighting throughout its length. Ownership passed to the Ministry of Transport in 1920, and then to British Waterways in 1962. Improvements were made, with the locks being mechanised between 1964 and 1969. By 1990, the canal was in obvious need of restoration, with lock walls bulging, and it was estimated that repairs would cost ¬£60 million. With no prospect of the Government funding this, British Waterways devised a repair plan, and between 1995 and 2005, sections of the canal were drained each winter. Stainless steel rods were used to tie the double-skinned lock walls together, and over 25,000 tonnes of grout were injected into the lock structures. All of the lock gates were replaced, and the result was a canal whose structures were probably in a better condition than they had ever been. The canal is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and attracts over 500,000 visitors each year. British Waterways, who work with the Highland Council and Forestry and Land Scotland through the Great Glen Ways Initiative, were hoping to increase this number to over 1 million by 2012. There are many ways for tourists to enjoy the canal, such as taking part in the Great Glen Rally, cycling along the tow-paths, or cruising on Hotel Barges. Names The canal has several names in Scottish Gaelic including Amar-Uisge/Se√≤laid a' Ghlinne Mh√≤ir (\\"Waterway of the Great Glen\\"), Sligh'-Uisge na h-Alba (\\"Waterway of Scotland\\") and a literal translation (An) Can√†l Cailleannach.

However, this is often without conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined. It can sometimes seem inelegant or lacking in simplicity, and eclectics are sometimes criticized for lack of consistency in their thinking. It is, however, common in many fields of study. For example, most psychologists accept certain aspects of behaviorism, but do not attempt to use the theory to explain all aspects of human behavior. Eclecticism in ethics, philosophy, and religion is also known as syncretism. Origin Eclecticism was first recorded to have been practiced by a group of ancient Greek and Roman philosophers who attached themselves to no real system, but selected from existing philosophical beliefs those doctrines that seemed most reasonable to them. Out of this collected material they constructed their new system of philosophy. The term comes from the Greek (eklektikos), literally \\"choosing the best\\",Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ‚Äì in philosophy and theology, the practice of selecting doctrines from different systems of thought without adopting the whole parent system for each doctrine, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library and that from (eklektos), \\"picked out, select\\"., Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library Well known eclectics in Greek philosophy were the Stoics Panaetius and Posidonius, and the New Academics Carneades and Philo of Larissa. Among the Romans, Cicero was thoroughly eclectic, as he united the Peripatetic, Stoic, and New Academic doctrines. Philo's successor and Cicero's teacher Antiochus of Ascalon is credited with influencing the Academy so that it finally transitioned from Scepticism to Eclecticism. Other eclectics included Varro and Seneca the Younger. According to Ro≈°ker and Suhadolnik, however, even though eclecticism had a Greek origin, the term was rarely used and it was even given a negative connotation by historians of Greek thought, associating it with the description for impure and unoriginal thinking. Scholars such as Clement of Alexandria maintained that eclecticism had a long history in Greek philosophy and it is underpinned by a deeper metaphysical and theological conviction concerning the absolute/God as the source of all noble thoughts and that all parts of the truth can be found among the various philosophical systems. Architecture and art New York Palace, Budapest, Hungary The term eclecticism is used to describe the combination, in a single work, of elements from different historical styles, chiefly in architecture and, by implication, in the fine and decorative arts. The term is sometimes also loosely applied to the general stylistic variety of 19th-century architecture after neoclassicism (), although the revivals of styles in that period have, since the 1970s, generally been referred to as aspects of historicism.Leonard K. Eaton, The Architecture of Choice: Eclectism in America, 1880-1910, 1975 Eclecticism plays an important role in critical discussions and evaluations but is somehow distant from the actual forms of the artifacts to which it is applied, and its meaning is thus rather indistinct. The simplest definition of the term‚Äîthat every work of art represents the combination of a variety of influences‚Äîis so basic as to be of little use. In some ways Eclecticism is reminiscent of Mannerism in that the term was used pejoratively for much of the period of its currency, although, unlike Mannerism, Eclecticism never amounted to a movement or constituted a specific style: it is characterized precisely by the fact that it was not a particular style. Madrid City Council (former Post Head Office) Madrid, Spain Martial arts Some martial arts can be described as eclectic in the sense that they borrow techniques from a wide variety of other martial arts. Philology In textual criticism, eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no a priori bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the United Bible Society, 4th ed. and Nestle-√Öland, 27th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.Aland, B. 1994: 138 Philosophy In Hellenistic philosophy, the Eclectics used elements from multiple philosophies, texts, life experiences, and their own philosophical ideas. These ideas include life as connected with existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. This movement is closely associated with Middle Platonism. Antiochus of Ascalon () was the pupil of Philo of Larissa, and the teacher of Cicero. Through his influence, Platonism transitioned from the Academic Skepticism of the New Academy to Eclecticism.Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th Edition Whereas Philo had adhered to the doctrine that there is nothing absolutely certain, Antiochus abandoned this to support dogmatism. Among his objections to skepticism was the consideration that without firm convictions no rational content of life is possible. Antiochus pointed out that it is a contradiction to assert that nothing can be asserted or to prove that nothing can be proved; that we cannot speak of false ideas and at the same time deny the distinction between false and true. He expounded the Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic systems in such a way as to show that these three schools deviated from one another only in minor points. Antiochus was chiefly interested in ethics, in which he tried to find a middle way between Zeno of Citium, Aristotle, and Plato. For instance, he said that virtue suffices for eudaimonia, but for the highest grade of happiness, bodily and external goods are necessary as well. This eclectic tendency was enabled by the fact that most of Plato's works were non-dogmatic. Middle Platonism was promoted by the necessity of considering the main theories of the post-Platonic schools of philosophy, such as the Aristotelian logic and the Stoic psychology and ethics (theory of goods and emotions). On the one hand the Middle Platonists were engaged like the later Peripatetics in scholarly activities such as the exposition of Plato's doctrines and the explanation of his dialogues; on the other hand they attempted to develop the Platonic theories systematically. In so far as it was subject in this to the influence of Neopythagoreanism, it was of considerable importance in preparing the way for Neoplatonism. In modern philosophy, Victor Cousin was the founder of modern Eclecticism.Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Brahman to Derrida, Taylor & Francis, 1998, p. 10: \\"Victor Cousin's eclectic\\". Psychology Eclecticism is recognized in approaches to psychology that see many factors influencing behavior and cognition or psyche. In the 1970s, psychologists started using whichever approaches and techniques that they deemed appropriate for their client. They take multiple perspectives into consideration while identifying, explaining, and changing the behavior of the client.

The junction of an avalanche diode is designed to prevent current concentration and resulting hot spots, so that the diode is undamaged by the breakdown. The avalanche breakdown is due to minority carriers accelerated enough to create ionization in the crystal lattice, producing more carriers which in turn create more ionization. Because the avalanche breakdown is uniform across the whole junction, the breakdown voltage is nearly constant with changing current when compared to a non- avalanche diode.L. W. Turner, (ed.), Electronics Engineer's Reference Book, 4th Edition, Newnes, 1976 pages 8-9 to 8-10 The Zener diode exhibits an apparently similar effect in addition to Zener breakdown. Both effects are present in any such diode, but one usually dominates the other. Avalanche diodes are optimized for avalanche effect so they exhibit small but significant voltage drop under breakdown conditions, unlike Zener diodes that always maintain a voltage higher than breakdown. This feature provides better surge protection than a simple Zener diode and acts more like a gas discharge tube replacement. Avalanche diodes have a small positive temperature coefficient of voltage, where diodes relying on the Zener effect have a negative temperature coefficient.Jacob Millman Microelectronics, McGraw-Hill, 1979 , pp. 45-47 Uses Avalanche diode current vs. voltage characteristic. =Voltage reference= The voltage after breakdown varies only slightly with changing current. This makes the avalanche diode useful as a type of voltage reference. Voltage reference diodes rated more than about 6-8volts are generally avalanche diodes. =Protection= A common application is to protect electronic circuits against damaging high voltages. The avalanche diode is connected to the circuit so that it is reverse-biased. In other words, its cathode is positive with respect to its anode. In this configuration, the diode is non-conducting and does not interfere with the circuit. If the voltage increases beyond the design limit, the diode goes into avalanche breakdown, causing the harmful voltage to be conducted to ground. When used in this fashion, they are often referred to as clamping diodes or transient voltage suppressors because they fix or \\"clamp\\" the maximum voltage to a predetermined level. Avalanche diodes are normally specified for this role by their clamping voltage VBR and the maximum amount of transient energy they can absorb, specified by either energy (in joules) or i^2rt. Avalanche breakdown is not destructive as long as the diode is prevented from overheating. =Radio-frequency noise generation= Avalanche diodes generate radio frequency noise. They are commonly used as noise sources in radio equipment and hardware random number generators. For instance, they are often used as a source of RF for antenna analyzer bridges. Avalanche diodes can also be used as white noise generators. =Microwave frequency generation= If placed into a resonant circuit, avalanche diodes can act as negative resistance devices. The IMPATT diode is an avalanche diode optimized for frequency generation. =Single-photon avalanche detector= These are made from doped silicon and depend on the avalanche breakdown effect to detect even single photons. The silicon avalanche photodiode is a high gain photon detector. They are \\"...ideal for use in high speed, low light level applications\\".Advanced Photonix, The avalanche photodiode is operated with a reverse bias voltage of up to hundreds of volts, slightly below its breakdown voltage. In this regime, electron hole pairs generated by the incident photons take a large amount of energy from the electric field, which creates more secondary charge carriers. The photocurrent of just one photon can be registered with these electronic devices.

Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in art: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences‚Äîmainly of elements from different historical styles in architecture, painting, and the graphic and decorative arts. In music the term used may be either eclecticism or polystylism. In the visual arts The term eclectic was first used by Johann Joachim Winckelmann to characterize the art of the Carracci, who incorporated in their paintings elements from the Renaissance and classical traditions. Indeed, Agostino, Annibale and Lodovico Carracci had tried to combine in their art Michelangelo's line, Titian's color, Correggio's chiaroscuro, and Raphael's symmetry and grace. In the 18th century, Sir Joshua Reynolds, head of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism.

Earl of Longford is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland. History The title was first bestowed upon Francis Aungier, 3rd Baron Aungier of Longford, in 1677, with remainder to his younger brother Ambrose. He had previously represented Surrey in the House of Commons and had already been created Viscount Longford in the Peerage of Ireland in 1675, with similar remainder. He was succeeded according to the special remainder (and, normally, in the barony) by his brother Ambrose, the second Earl. On his death in 1706 all the titles became extinct. The title of Baron Aungier of Longford was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1621 for the first Earl's grandfather Sir Francis Aungier, Master of the Rolls in Ireland. The latter was succeeded by his eldest son Gerald, the second Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his nephew, the aforementioned third Baron and first Earl of Longford, the eldest son of Ambrose Aungier, Chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, second son of the first Baron. Gerald Aungier, brother of the first Earl, was Governor of Bombay. Alice Aungier, sister of the first and second Earl of Longford, married Sir James Cuffe, Member of Parliament for County Mayo. Their son Francis Cuffe also represented County Mayo in the Irish Parliament. Francis's son Michael Cuffe sat as Member of Parliament for County Mayo and Longford Borough. Michael's daughter Elizabeth Cuffe married Thomas Pakenham, of Pakenham Hall, just outside Castlepollard, County Westmeath, in 1739. Thomas represented Longford Borough in the Irish House of Commons. In 1756 the Longford title held by his wife's ancestors was revived when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Longford, in the County of Longford. In 1785 the earldom was also revived when Elizabeth was created Countess of Longford in her own right in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Longford was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He represented Longford County in the Irish Parliament. He died aged only 49 and was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. In 1794 the third baron also succeeded his grandmother as second Earl of Longford. Lord Longford sat in the British House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish Representative Peers. In 1821 he was created Baron Silchester, of Silchester in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served under the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1866 to 1868. His son, the fifth Earl, was Lord-Lieutenant of County Longford from 1887 to 1915. Lord Longford was killed in action at Gallipoli in 1915. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He was a minor playwright and poet and also sat as a member of Seanad √âireann between 1946 and 1948. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. He was a prominent Labour politician and social activist. In 1945, sixteen years before he succeeded his elder brother, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Pakenham, of Cowley in the City of Oxford. Lord Longford served in the Labour administrations of Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Privy Seal, Leader of the House of Lords and Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1999, at the age of 94 and after the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Lord Longford was created a life peer as Baron Pakenham of Cowley, of Cowley in the County of Oxfordshire. He was therefore able to remain a member of the House of Lords until his death in 2001. the titles (other than that of Baron Pakenham of Cowley, which as a life peerage became extinct in 2001) are held by his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He does not use his title and did not use his courtesy title of Lord Silchester which he was entitled to from 1961 to 2001. Known simply as Thomas Pakenham, he is a writer and historian. Several other members of the Pakenham family have also gained distinction. Henry Pakenham, great-grandfather of the first Baron, represented Navan in the Irish House of Commons. His son Sir Thomas Pakenham, grandfather of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Augher. Sir Thomas's son Edward Pakenham, father of the first Baron, represented County Westmeath in the Irish Parliament. The Honourable Sir Thomas Pakenham, third son of the first Baron and the Countess of Longford, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. His fourth son Sir John Pakenham was also an admiral in the Royal Navy while his fifth son Sir Richard Pakenham was a noted diplomat and served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States from 1843 to 1847. The Honourable Sir Edward Pakenham, second son of the second Baron, was a major- general in the army. He served in the Peninsular Wars under his brother-in- law, General Arthur Wellesey, who married his sister Kitty Pakenham in 1806. Sir Edward Pakenham was killed at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. The Honourable Sir Hercules Pakenham (1781‚Äì1850), third son of the second Baron, was a lieutenant-general in the army and Member of Parliament for Westmeath. He was the father of 1) Edward Pakenham, Member of Parliament for Antrim, and 2) Sir Thomas Pakenham, also a lieutenant-general. The latter's eldest son Hercules Pakenham was an Ulster Unionist Party member of the Senate of Northern Ireland. The Honourable Thomas Alexander Pakenham (1820‚Äì1889), third son of the second Earl, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. His second son Sir William Pakenham was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Honourable Sir Francis Pakenham, seventh son of the second Earl, was a diplomat and notably served as Ambassador to Sweden. Lady Violet Pakenham, daughter of the fifth Earl, was a writer and critic and the wife of the author Anthony Powell. Elizabeth Pakenham (born Harman), Countess of Longford, wife of the seventh Earl, was a writer and social activist.

Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days from November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981, after a group of Iranian college students belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, who supported the Iranian Revolution, took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Western media described the crisis as an \\"entanglement\\" of \\"vengeance and mutual incomprehension.\\" American President Jimmy Carter called the hostage- taking an act of \\"blackmail\\" and the hostages \\"victims of terrorism and anarchy.\\" In Iran it was widely seen as an act against the U.S. and its influence in Iran, including its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution and its longstanding support of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979. After Shah Pahlavi was overthrown, he was admitted to the U.S. for cancer treatment. Iran demanded his return in order to stand trial for crimes that he was accused of committing during his reign. Specifically, he was accused of committing crimes against Iranian citizens with the help of his secret police. Iran's demands were rejected by the United States, and Iran saw the decision to grant him asylum as American complicity in those atrocities. The Americans saw the hostage-taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the Vienna Convention, which granted diplomats immunity from arrest and made diplomatic compounds inviolable.Kinzer, Stephen. (2003). All The Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons.Nalle, David. (2003). \\"All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror\\"; Middle East Policy, Vol. X (4), 148‚Äì55.Pryce-Jones, David. (2003). \\"A Very Elegant Coup.\\" National Review, 55 (17), 48‚Äì50. The Shah left the United States in December 1979 and was ultimately granted asylum in Egypt, where he died from complications of cancer at age 60 on July 27, 1980. Six American diplomats who had evaded capture had been rescued by a joint CIA‚ÄìCanadian effort on January 27, 1980. The crisis reached a climax after diplomatic negotiations failed to win the release of the hostages. Carter ordered the U.S. military to attempt a rescue mission ‚Äì Operation Eagle Claw ‚Äì using warships that included the and , which were patrolling the waters near Iran. The failed attempt on April 24, 1980 resulted in the death of one Iranian civilian, and the accidental deaths of eight American servicemen after one of the helicopters crashed into a transport aircraft. United States Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned his position following the failure. In September 1980 Iraq invaded Iran, beginning the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. These events led the Iranian government to enter negotiations with the U.S., with Algeria acting as a mediator. The crisis is considered a pivotal episode in the history of Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations. Political analysts cited the standoff as a major factor in the continuing downfall of Carter's presidency and his landslide loss in the 1980 presidential election;Reagan's Lucky Day: Iranian Hostage Crisis Helped The Great Communicator To Victory , CBS News, January 21, 2001 the hostages were formally released into United States custody the day after the signing of the Algiers Accords, just minutes after American President Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. In Iran the crisis strengthened the prestige of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the political power of theocrats who opposed any normalization of relations with the West.Mackey, Sandra, The Iranians: Persia, Islam and the Soul of a Nation, New York: Dutton, c. 1996 (p. 298) The crisis also led to American economic sanctions against Iran, which further weakened ties between the two countries. Background =1953 coup d'√©tat= In February 1979, less than a year before the crisis, the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown during the Iranian Revolution. For several decades before that, the United States had allied with and supported the Shah. During World War II, Allied powers Britain and the Soviet Union occupied Iran to force the abdication of first Pahlavi monarch Reza Shah Pahlavi, in favor of his eldest son, Crown Prince Mohammad.Abrahamian, Iran Between Two Revolutions, (1982), p. 164 The Allies feared that Reza Shah intended to align his petroleum-rich country with Nazi Germany, but Reza Shah's earlier declaration of neutrality, and his refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train or supply Soviet troops against Germany, were the strongest motives for the Allied invasion of Iran. Because of its importance in the Allied victory, Iran was subsequently called \\"The Bridge of Victory\\" by Winston Churchill. By the 1950s Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was engaged in a power struggle with Iran's prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, an immediate descendant of the preceding Qajar dynasty. Mosaddegh led a general strike on behalf of impoverished Iranians, demanding a share of the nation's petroleum revenue from Britain's Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. However, he overstepped in trying to get $50 million in damages and lost revenue from the British.(p. 52 poverty p. 54 Postwar Brit, p. 63 acceptance of 50:50 split, demand for $50 million in damages & back revenues, The Persian Puzzle, Kenneth M. Pollack. New York: Random House, 2004.) In 1953, the British and American spy agencies helped Iranian royalists depose Mosaddegh in a military coup d'√©tat codenamed Operation Ajax, allowing the Shah to extend his power. The Shah appointed himself an absolute monarch rather than a constitutional monarch, his position before the 1953 crisis, with the aim of assuming complete control of the government and purging the disloyal.Mohammed Amjad. Iran: From Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy. Greenwood Press, 1989. p. 62 \\"the United States had decided to save the 'free world' by overthrowing the democratically elected government of Mosaddegh.\\"Iran by Andrew Burke, Mark Elliott, p. 37 The U.S. continued to support and fund the Shah after the coup, with the Central Intelligence Agency training the government's SAVAK secret police. In the subsequent decades of the Cold War, various economic, cultural, and political issues united opposition against the Shah and led to his overthrow. =Carter administration= Months before the Iranian Revolution, on New Year's Eve 1977, President Carter further angered anti-Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi, declaring how beloved the shah was by his people. After the revolution culminated in February 1979 with the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini from France, the American Embassy was occupied and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy's front-facing windows that they had been replaced with bulletproof glass. The embassy's staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly one thousand earlier in the decade.Bowden 2006, p. 19 The Carter administration tried to mitigate anti-American feeling by promoting a new relationship with the de facto Iranian government and continuing military cooperation in hopes that the situation would stabilize. However, on October 22, 1979, the United States permitted the Shah, who had lymphoma, to enter New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for medical treatment. The State Department had discouraged the request, understanding the political delicacy. But in response to pressure from influential figures including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Council on Foreign Relations Chairman David Rockefeller, the Carter administration decided to grant it.,According to an article in the NYTimes the activities of the Chase Manhattan Bank triggered the whole hostages crisis. The Shah's admission to the United States intensified Iranian revolutionaries' anti-Americanism and spawned rumors of another U.S.‚Äìbacked coup that would re-install him. Ayatollah Khomeini, who had been exiled by the shah for 15 years, heightened the rhetoric against the \\"Great Satan\\", as he called the United States, talking of \\"evidence of American plotting.\\"Moin Khomeini, (2000), p. 220 In addition to ending what they believed was American sabotage of the revolution, the hostage takers hoped to depose the provisional revolutionary government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, which they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the United States and extinguish Islamic revolutionary order in Iran.Bowden 2006, p. 10 The occupation of the embassy on November 4, 1979, was also intended as leverage to demand the return of the shah to stand trial in Iran in exchange for the hostages. A later study claimed that there had been no American plots to overthrow the revolutionaries, and that a CIA intelligence-gathering mission at the embassy had been \\"notably ineffectual, gathering little information and hampered by the fact that none of the three officers spoke the local language, Persian.\\" Its work, the study said, was \\"routine, prudent espionage conducted at diplomatic missions everywhere.\\" Prelude =First attempt= On the morning of February 14, 1979 ‚Äì the same day that the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Adolph Dubs, was kidnapped and fatally shot by Muslim extremists in Kabul ‚Äì the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took a Marine named Kenneth Kraus hostage. Ambassador William Sullivan surrendered the embassy to save lives, and with the assistance of Iranian Foreign Minister Ebrahim Yazdi, returned the embassy to U.S. hands within three hours. Kraus was injured in the attack, kidnapped by the militants, tortured, tried, and convicted of murder. He was to be executed, but President Carter and Sullivan secured his release within six days. This incident became known as the Valentine's Day Open House. Anticipating the takeover of the embassy, the Americans tried to destroy classified documents in a furnace. The furnace malfunctioned and the staff was forced to use cheap paper shredders.Bowden 2006, p. 30Farber, Taken Hostage (2005), p. 134 Skilled carpet weavers were later employed to reconstruct the documents.Bowden 2006, p. 337 =Second attempt= The next attempt to seize the American Embassy was planned for September 1979 by Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a student at the time. He consulted with the heads of the Islamic associations of Tehran's main universities, including the University of Tehran, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology (Polytechnic of Tehran), and Iran University of Science and Technology. They named their group Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line. Asgharzadeh later said there were five students at the first meeting, two of whom wanted to target the Soviet Embassy because the USSR was \\"a Marxist and anti-God regime\\". Two others, Mohsen Mirdamadi and Habibolah Bitaraf, supported Asgharzadeh's chosen target: the United States. \\"Our aim was to object against the American government by going to their embassy and occupying it for several hours,\\" Asgharzadeh said. \\"Announcing our objections from within the occupied compound would carry our message to the world in a much more firm and effective way.\\" Mirdamadi told an interviewer, \\"We intended to detain the diplomats for a few days, maybe one week, but no more.\\"Molavi, Afshin, The Soul of Iran, Norton, (2005), p. 335 Masoumeh Ebtekar, the spokeswoman for the Iranian students during the crisis, said that those who rejected Asgharzadeh's plan did not participate in the subsequent events. The students observed the procedures of the Marine Security Guards from nearby rooftops overlooking the embassy. They also drew on their experiences from the recent revolution, during which the U.S. Embassy grounds were briefly occupied. They enlisted the support of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards.Bowden 2006, pp. 8, 13 According to the group and other sources, Ayatollah Khomeini did not know of the plan beforehand. The students had wanted to inform him, but according to the author Mark Bowden, Ayatollah Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha persuaded them not to. Khoeiniha feared that the government would use the police to expel the students as they had the occupiers in February. The provisional government had been appointed by Khomeini, and so Khomeini was likely to go along with the government's request to restore order. On the other hand, Khoeiniha knew that if Khomeini first saw that the occupiers were faithful supporters of him (unlike the leftists in the first occupation) and that large numbers of pious Muslims had gathered outside the embassy to show their support for the takeover, it would be \\"very hard, perhaps even impossible,\\" for him to oppose the takeover, and this would paralyze the Bazargan administration, which Khoeiniha and the students wanted to eliminate.Bowden 2006, p. 12 Supporters of the takeover stated that their motivation was fear of another American- backed coup against their popular revolution. =Takeover= Two American hostages during the siege of the U.S. Embassy. On November 4, 1979, one of the demonstrations organized by Iranian student unions loyal to Khomeini erupted into an all-out conflict right outside the walled compound housing the U.S. Embassy. At about 6:30 a.m., the ringleaders gathered between three hundred and five hundred selected students and briefed them on the battle plan. A female student was given a pair of metal cutters to break the chains locking the embassy's gates and hid them beneath her chador. At first, the students planned a symbolic occupation, in which they would release statements to the press and leave when government security forces came to restore order. This was reflected in placards saying: \\"Don't be afraid. We just want to sit in.\\" When the embassy guards brandished firearms, the protesters retreated, with one telling the Americans, \\"We don't mean any harm.\\"Bowden 2006, pp. 40, 77 But as it became clear that the guards would not use deadly force and that a large, angry crowd had gathered outside the compound to cheer the occupiers and jeer the hostages, the plan changed.Bowden 2006, pp. 127‚Äì28 According to one embassy staff member, buses full of demonstrators began to appear outside the embassy shortly after the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line broke through the gates.Bowden 2006 As Khomeini's followers had hoped, Khomeini supported the takeover. According to Foreign Minister Yazdi, when he went to Qom to tell Khomeini about it, Khomeini told him to \\"go and kick them out.\\" But later that evening, back in Tehran, Yazdi heard on the radio that Khomeini had issued a statement supporting the seizure, calling it \\"the second revolution\\" and the embassy an \\"American spy den in Tehran.\\"Bowden 2006, p. 93 clip from a newsreel regarding the hostage crisis (1980) The occupiers bound and blindfolded the Marines and staff at the embassy and paraded them in front of photographers. In the first couple of days, many of the embassy workers who had sneaked out of the compound or had not been there at the time of the takeover were rounded up by Islamists and returned as hostages.Bowden 2006, pp. 50, 132‚Äì34 Six American diplomats managed to avoid capture and took refuge in the British Embassy before being transferred to the Canadian Embassy. Others went to the Swedish Embassy in Tehran for three months. In a joint covert operation known as the Canadian caper, the Canadian government and the CIA managed to smuggle them out of Iran on January 28, 1980, using Canadian passports and a cover story that identified them as a film crew. A State Department diplomatic cable of November 8, 1979, details \\"A Tentative, Incomplete List of U.S. Personnel Being Held in the Embassy Compound.\\" =Motivations= The Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi return to Iran for trial and execution. The U.S. maintained that the Shah ‚Äì who was to die less than a year later, in July 1980 ‚Äì had come to America for medical attention. The group's other demands included that the U.S. government apologize for its interference in the internal affairs of Iran, including the overthrow of Prime Minister Mosaddegh in 1953, and that Iran's frozen assets in the United States be released. alleged by some former hostages to be future President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, although he, Iran's government, and the CIA deny this. The initial plan was to hold the embassy for only a short time, but this changed after it became apparent how popular the takeover was and that Khomeini had given it his full support. Some attributed the decision not to release the hostages quickly to President Carter's failure to immediately deliver an ultimatum to Iran.Moin, Khomeini (2001), p. 226 His initial response was to appeal for the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds and to share his hopes for a strategic anti-communist alliance with the Ayatollah.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 221; \\"America Can't do a *** Thing\\" by Amir Taheri New York Post, November 2, 2004 As some of the student leaders had hoped, Iran's moderate prime minister, Bazargan, and his cabinet resigned under pressure just days after the takeover. The duration of the hostages' captivity has also been attributed to internal Iranian revolutionary politics. As Ayatollah Khomeini told Iran's president: > This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can > put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out > presidential and parliamentary elections.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 228 Theocratic Islamists, as well as leftist political groups like the socialist People's Mujahedin of Iran,Abrahamian, Ervand (1989), The Iranian Mojahedin (1989), p. 196 supported the taking of hostages as a counterattack against \\"American imperialism.\\" According to scholar Daniel Pipes, writing in 1980, the Marxist-leaning leftists and the Islamists shared a common antipathy toward market-based reforms under the late Shah, and both subsumed individualism, including the unique identity of women, under conservative, though contrasting, visions of collectivism. Accordingly, both groups favored the Soviet Union over the United States in the early months of the Iranian Revolution. The Soviets, and possibly their allies Cuba, Libya, and East Germany, were suspected of providing indirect assistance to the participants in the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The PLO under Yasser Arafat provided personnel, intelligence liaisons, funding, and training for Khomeini's forces before and after the revolution, and was suspected of playing a role in the embassy crisis. Fidel Castro reportedly praised Khomeini as a revolutionary anti-imperialist who could find common cause between revolutionary socialists and anti-American Islamists. Both expressed disdain for modern capitalism and a preference for authoritarian collectivism. Cuba and its socialist ally Venezuela, under Hugo Ch√°vez, would later form ALBA in alliance with the Islamic Republic as a counter to neoliberal American influence. Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding, to buttress their claim that the U.S. was trying to destabilize the new regime. By embracing the hostage-taking under the slogan \\"America can't do a thing,\\" Khomeini rallied support and deflected criticism of his controversial theocratic constitution,Arjomand, Said Amir, Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran by Said Amir Arjomand, Oxford University Press, 1988 p. 139 which was scheduled for a referendum vote in less than one month.Moin, Khomeini (2000), p. 227 The referendum was successful, and after the vote, both leftists and theocrats continued to use allegations of pro-Americanism to suppress their opponents: relatively moderate political forces that included the Iranian Freedom Movement, the National Front, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari,Moin, Khomeini (2000), pp. 229, 231; Bakhash, Reign of the Ayatollahs, (1984), pp. 115‚Äì16 and later President Abolhassan Banisadr. In particular, carefully selected diplomatic dispatches and reports discovered at the embassy and released by the hostage-takers led to the disempowerment and resignation of moderate figuresBakhash, Reign of the Ayatollahs, (1984), p. 115 such as Bazargan. The failed rescue attempt and the political danger of any move seen as accommodating America delayed a negotiated release of the hostages. After the crisis ended, leftists and theocrats turned on each other, with the stronger theocratic group annihilating the left. An anti-Iranian protest in Washington, D.C., in 1979. The front of the sign reads \\"Deport all Iranians\\" and \\"Get the hell out of my country\\", and the back reads \\"Release all Americans now\\".  Discovered documents of the American embassy  Supporters of the takeover claimed that in 1953, the American Embassy had acted as a \\"den of spies\\" from which the coup was organized. Documents were later found in the embassy suggesting that some staff members had been working with American intelligence agencies. Later, the CIA confirmed its role and that of the British government in the notorious 1953 coup against Iran's democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq. After the Shah entered the United States, Ayatollah Khomeini called for street demonstrations. Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy, sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding, to buttress their claim that \\"the Great Satan\\" (the U.S.) was trying to destabilize the new regime and that Iranian moderates were in league with the U.S. The documents ‚Äì including telegrams, correspondence, and reports from the U.S. State Department and CIA ‚Äì were published in a series of books called Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den (). According to a 1997 Federation of American Scientists bulletin, by 1995, 77 volumes of Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den had been published. Many of these volumes are now available online. The 444-day crisis =Hostage conditions= The hostage-takers, declaring their solidarity with other \\"oppressed minorities\\" and \\"the special place of women in Islam,\\" released one woman and two African Americans on November 19.Efty, Alex; 'If Shah Not Returned, Khomeini Sets Trial for Other Hostages'; Kentucky New Era, November 20, 1979, pp. 1‚Äì2 Before release, these hostages were required by their captors to hold a press conference in which Kathy Gross and William Quarles praised the revolution's aims,Farber, Taken Hostage (2005), pp. 156‚Äì57 but four further women and six African-Americans were released the following day. The only African-American hostage not released that month was Charles A. Jones, Jr. One more hostage, a white man named Richard Queen, was released in July 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. The remaining 52 hostages were held until January 1981, up to 444 days of captivity. The hostages were initially held at the embassy, but after the takers took the cue from the failed rescue mission, the detainees were scattered around Iran in order to make a single rescue attempt impossible. Three high-level officials ‚Äì Bruce Laingen, Victor L. Tomseth, and Mike Howland ‚Äì were at the Foreign Ministry at the time of the takeover. They stayed there for some months, sleeping in the ministry's formal dining room and washing their socks and underwear in the bathroom. At first, they were treated as diplomats, but after the provisional government fell, their treatment deteriorated. By March, the doors to their living space were kept \\"chained and padlocked.\\"Bowden 2006, pp. 151, 219, 372 By midsummer 1980, the Iranians had moved the hostages to prisons in TehranBowden 2006, p. 528 to prevent escapes or rescue attempts and to improve the logistics of guard shifts and food delivery.Bowden 2006, pp. 514‚Äì15 The final holding area, from November 1980 until their release, was the Teymur Bakhtiar mansion in Tehran, where the hostages were finally given tubs, showers, and hot and cold running water.Bowden 2006, p. 565 Several foreign diplomats and ambassadors ‚Äì including former Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor ‚Äì visited the hostages over the course of the crisis and relayed information back to the U.S. government, including dispatches from Laingen. A headline in an Islamic Republican newspaper on November 5, 1979, read \\"Revolutionary occupation of U.S. embassy\\". Iranian propaganda stated that the hostages were \\"guests\\" and were treated with respect.

The first time, he was kept in handcuffs for two weeks,Bowden 2006, p. 284 and the second time, he was beaten and kept alone in a freezing cell for two weeks.Bowden 2006, p. 544 Another hostage, U.S. Army medic Donald Hohman, went on a hunger strike for several weeks,Bowden 2006, p. 335 and two hostages attempted suicide.

He was found by guards and rushed to the hospital.Bowden 2006, p. 345 Jerry Miele, a CIA communication technician, smashed his head into the corner of a door, knocking himself unconscious and cutting a deep gash. \\"Naturally withdrawn\\" and looking \\"ill, old, tired, and vulnerable,\\" Miele had become the butt of his guards' jokes, and they had rigged up a mock electric chair to emphasize the fate that awaited him.

Television news gave daily updates.The ABC late-night program America Held Hostage, anchored by Ted Koppel, later became a stalwart news magazine under the title Nightline. In January 1980, the CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite began ending each show by saying how many days the hostages had been captive.Zelizer, Julian E. Jimmy Carter: the 39th President, 1977‚Äì81. New York: Times, 2010. Print. President Carter applied economic and diplomatic pressure: Oil imports from Iran were ended on November 12, 1979, and with Executive Order 12170, around US$8 billion of Iranian assets in the United States were frozen by the Office of Foreign Assets Control on November 14. During the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1979, high school students made cards that were delivered to the hostages. Community groups across the country did the same, resulting in bales of Christmas cards. The National Christmas Tree was left dark except for the top star. At the time, two Trenton, N.J., newspapers ‚Äì The Trenton Times and the Trentonian and perhaps others around the country ‚Äì printed full-page color American flags in their newspapers for readers to cut out and place in the front windows of their homes as support for the hostages until they were brought home safely. A severe backlash against Iranians in the United States developed. One Iranian American later complained, \\"I had to hide my Iranian identity not to get beaten up, even at university.\\" According to Bowden, a pattern emerged in President Carter's attempts to negotiate the hostages' release: \\"Carter would latch on to a deal proffered by a top Iranian official and grant minor but humiliating concessions, only to have it scotched at the last minute by Khomeini.\\"Bowden 2006, p. 401 =Canadian rescue of hostages= Americans expressed gratitude for Canadian efforts to rescue American diplomats during the hostage crisis. On the day the hostages were seized, six American diplomats evaded capture and remained in hiding at the home of the Canadian diplomat John Sheardown, under the protection of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor. In late 1979, the government of Prime Minister Joe Clark secretly issued an Order in Council allowing Canadian passports to be issued to some American citizens so that they could escape. In cooperation with the CIA, which used the cover story of a film project, two CIA agents and the six American diplomats boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich, Switzerland, on January 28, 1980. Their rescue from Iran, known as the Canadian caper, were fictionalized in the 1981 film Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper and the 2012 film Argo. =Negotiations for release= =Rescue attempts= First rescue attempt Cyrus Vance, the United States Secretary of State, had argued against the push by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor, for a military solution to the crisis. Vance, struggling with gout, went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend. On Friday Brzezinski held a newly scheduled meeting of the National Security Council where the president authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages. Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher, who attended the meeting in Vance's place, did not inform Vance. Furious, Vance handed in his resignation on principle, calling Brzezinski \\"evil.\\" Late in the afternoon of April 24, 1980, eight RH‚Äë53D helicopters flew from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz to a remote road serving as an airstrip in the Great Salt Desert of Eastern Iran, near Tabas. They encountered severe dust storms that disabled two of the helicopters, which were traveling in complete radio silence. Early the next morning, the remaining six helicopters met up with several waiting Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft at a landing site and refueling area designated \\"Desert One\\". At this point, a third helicopter was found to be unserviceable, bringing the total below the six deemed vital for the mission. The commander of the operation, Col. Charles Alvin Beckwith, recommended that the mission be aborted, and his recommendation was approved by President Carter. As the helicopters repositioned themselves for refueling, one ran into a C‚Äë130 tanker aircraft and crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen and injuring several more. In May 1980, the Joint Chiefs of Staff commissioned a Special Operations review group of six senior military officers, led by Adm. James L. Holloway III, to thoroughly examine all aspects of the rescue attempt. The group identified 23 issues that were significant in the failure of the mission, 11 of which it deemed major. The overriding issue was operational security ‚Äì that is, keeping the mission secret so that the arrival of the rescue team at the embassy would be a complete surprise. This severed the usual relationship between pilots and weather forecasters; the pilots were not informed about the local dust storms. Another security requirement was that the helicopter pilots come from the same unit. The unit picked for the mission was a U.S. Navy mine-laying unit flying CH-53D Sea Stallions; these helicopters were considered the best suited for the mission because of their long range, large capacity, and compatibility with shipboard operations. Two hours into the flight, the crew of helicopter No. 6 saw a warning light indicating that a main rotor might be cracked. They landed in the desert, confirmed visually that a crack had started to develop, and stopped flying in accordance with normal operating procedure. Helicopter No. 8 landed to pick up the crew of No. 6, and abandoned No. 6 in the desert without destroying it. The report by Holloway's group pointed out that a cracked helicopter blade could have been used to continue the mission and that its likelihood of catastrophic failure would have been low for many hours, especially at lower flying speeds. The report found that the pilot of No. 6 would have continued the mission if instructed to do so. When the helicopters encountered two dust storms along the way to the refueling point, the second more severe than the first, the pilot of No. 5 turned back because the mine- laying helicopters were not equipped with terrain-following radar. The report found that the pilot could have continued to the refueling point if he had been told that better weather awaited him there, but because of the command for radio silence, he did not ask about the conditions ahead. The report also concluded that \\"there were ways to pass the information\\" between the refueling station and the helicopter force \\"that would have small likelihood of compromising the mission\\" ‚Äì in other words, that the ban on communication had not been necessary at this stage. Helicopter No. 2 experienced a partial hydraulic system failure but was able to fly on for four hours to the refueling location. There, an inspection showed that a hydraulic fluid leak had damaged a pump and that the helicopter could not be flown safely, nor repaired in time to continue the mission. Six helicopters was thought to be the absolute minimum required for the rescue mission, so with the force reduced to five, the local commander radioed his intention to abort. This request was passed through military channels to President Carter, who agreed. After the mission and its failure were made known publicly, Khomeini credited divine intervention on behalf of Islam, and his prestige skyrocketed in Iran.Mackey, Iranians, (2000), p. 298 Iranian officials who favored release of the hostages, such as President Bani Sadr, were weakened. In America, President Carter's political popularity and prospects for being re-elected in 1980 were further damaged after a television address on April 25 in which he explained the rescue operation and accepted responsibility for its failure. Planned second attempt A second rescue attempt, planned but never carried out, would have used highly modified YMC-130H Hercules aircraft.Thigpen, (2001), p. 241. Three aircraft, outfitted with rocket thrusters to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the Shahid Shiroudi football stadium near the embassy, were modified under a rushed, top- secret program known as Operation Credible Sport.\\"C-130 Hercules on Aircraft carrier\\". Defence Aviation, 2 May 2007. Retrieved: 2 October 2010. One crashed during a demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base on October 29, 1980, when its braking rockets were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire, but all on board survived. After Carter lost the presidential election in November, the project was abandoned. The failed rescue attempt led to the creation of the 160th SOAR, a helicopter aviation Special Operations group.Vice President George H. W. Bush and other VIPs wait to welcome the hostages home. The hostages disembark Freedom One, an Air Force Boeing C-137 Stratoliner aircraft, upon their return. =Release= With the completion of negotiations signified by the signing of the Algiers Accords on January 19, 1981, the hostages were released on January 20, 1981. That day, minutes after President Reagan completed his 20‚Äëminute inaugural address after being sworn in, the 52 American hostages were released to U.S. personnel. There are theories and conspiracy theories regarding why Iran postponed the release until that moment. (See also: October Surprise conspiracy theory) They were flown on an Algerian plane from Iran to Algiers, Algeria, where they were formally transferred to Warren M. Christopher, the representative of the United States, as a symbolic gesture of appreciation for the Algerian government's help in resolving the crisis. The flight continued to Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany and on to an Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden, where former President Carter, acting as emissary, received them. After medical check-ups and debriefings, the hostages made a second flight to a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland, where they were greeted by a large crowd. The released hostages were then flown to Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. From Newburgh, they traveled by bus to the United States Military Academy at West Point and stayed at the Thayer Hotel for three days, receiving a heroes' welcome all along the route. Ten days after their release, they were given a ticker tape parade through the Canyon of Heroes in New York City. Aftermath =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= The Iraqi invasion of Iran occurred less than a year after the embassy employees were taken hostage. The journalist Stephen Kinzer argues that the dramatic change in American‚ÄìIranian relations, from allies to enemies, helped embolden the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, and that the United States' anger with Iran led it to aid the Iraqis after the war turned against them. The United States supplied Iraq with, among other things, \\"helicopters and satellite intelligence that was used in selecting bombing targets.\\" This assistance \\"deepened and widened anti-American feeling in Iran.\\" =Consequences for Iran= A protest in Tehran on November 4, 2015, against the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. The November 2015 protest in Tehran. The hostage- taking was unsuccessful for Iran in some respects. It lost international support for its war against Iraq, and the negotiated settlement was considered almost wholly favorable to the United States because it did not meet any of Iran's original demands.Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution, Keddie, Nikki, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 252 Nevertheless, the crisis strengthened Iranians who had supported the hostage-taking. Anti-Americanism became even more intense.Bakhash, Reign of the Ayatollahs, (1984), p. 236 Politicians such as Khoeiniha and Behzad NabaviBrumberg, Daniel Reinventing Khomeini, University of Chicago Press (2001), p. 118 were left in a stronger position, while those associated with ‚Äì or accused of association with ‚Äì America were removed from the political picture. A Khomeini biographer, Baqer Moin, described the crisis as \\"a watershed in Khomeini's life\\" that transformed him from \\"a cautious, pragmatic politician\\" into \\"a modern revolutionary single-mindedly pursuing a dogma.\\" In Khomeini's statements, imperialism and liberalism were \\"negative words,\\" while revolution \\"became a sacred word, sometimes more important than Islam.\\"Moin, Khomeini, (2000) p. 229 Some have suggested that the greatest benefit of the takeover of the American Embassy was the acquisition of intelligence contained within the embassy, including the identity of informants to the U.S. government, which the new Islamist government could use to remove potential dissenters and consolidate its gains. The Iranian government commemorates the event every year with a demonstration at the embassy and the burning of an American flag. However, on November 4, 2009, pro-democracy protesters and reformists demonstrated in the streets of Tehran. When the authorities encouraged them to chant \\"death to America,\\" the protesters instead chanted \\"death to the dictator\\" (referring to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) and other anti-government slogans. =Consequences for the United States= Simulation of the first day of the event, 3 November 2016, Tehran Gifts, including lifetime passes to any minor league or Major League Baseball game, were showered on the hostages upon their return to the United States. In 2000 the hostages and their families tried unsuccessfully to sue Iran under the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. They originally won the case when Iran failed to provide a defense, but the State Department then tried to end the lawsuit, fearing that it would make international relations difficult. As a result, a federal judge ruled that no damages could be awarded to the hostages because of the agreement the United States had made when the hostages were freed. The former U.S. Embassy building is now used by Iran's government and affiliated groups. Since 2001 it has served as a museum to the revolution. Outside the door, there is a bronze model based on the Statue of Liberty on one side and a statue portraying one of the hostages on the other. The Guardian reported in 2006 that a group called the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign had used the embassy to recruit \\"martyrdom seekers\\": volunteers to carry out operations against Western and Israeli targets. Mohammad Samadi, a spokesman for the group, signed up several hundred volunteers in a few days. Iran hostage crisis memorial =Diplomatic relations= The United States and Iran broke off formal diplomatic relations over the hostage crisis. Iran selected Algeria as its protecting power in the United States, transferring the mandate to Pakistan in 1992. The United States selected Switzerland as its protecting power in Iran. Relations are maintained through the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy and the U.S. Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy. Operation Eagle Claw remnant in the former embassy Hostages There were 66 original captives: 63 taken at the embassy and three captured and held at the Foreign Ministry offices.

The only hostage serviceman not issued the medal was Staff Sgt Joseph Subic, Jr., who \\"did not behave under stress the way noncommissioned officers are expected to act\\" ‚Äì that is, he cooperated with the hostage-takers, according to other hostages.Bowden, Mark Guests of the Ayatollah, Grove Press, 2006, p. 374 The Humanitarian Service Medal was awarded to the servicemen of Joint Task Force 1‚Äì79, the planning authority for Operation Rice Bowl/Eagle Claw, who participated in the rescue attempt.

October Surprise conspiracy theory Allegations that the Reagan administration negotiated a delay in the release of the hostages until after the 1980 presidential election have been numerous but unproven. Gary Sick, principal White House aide for Iran and the Persian Gulf on the Carter administration's National Security Council, claimed in his book October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan that CIA Director William Casey and possibly Vice President George H. W. Bush went to Paris to negotiate such a delay. Many others have made the same allegations. In popular culture * Laurie Anderson's surprise 1982 UK #2 hit \\"O Superman (For Massenet)\\" is a reference to the failure of Operation Eagle Claw at the peak of the crisis. * The Academy Award‚Äìwinning movie Argo was based on the taking of hostages by Iranian revolutionaries. The movie was criticized for changing the story considerably, including by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter: > 90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was > Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American CIA. And > with that exception, the movie is very good. But Ben Affleck's character in > the film was ... only in Tehran a day and a half.

In this situation, the latter planet is said to be superior to the former. In the reference frame of the Earth, in which the terms were originally used, the inferior planets are Mercury and Venus, while the superior planets are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Dwarf planets like Ceres or Pluto and most asteroids are 'superior' in the sense that they almost all orbit outside the orbit of Earth.  History  These terms were originally used in the geocentric cosmology of Claudius Ptolemy to differentiate as inferior those planets (Mercury and Venus) whose epicycle remained co-linear with the Earth and Sun, and as superior those planets (Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) that did not. In the 16th century, the terms were modified by Copernicus, who rejected Ptolemy's geocentric model, to distinguish a planet's orbit's size in relation to the Earth's. Planets in each category When Earth is stated or assumed to be the reference point: *\\"Inferior planet\\" refers to Mercury and Venus, which are closer to the Sun than Earth is. *\\"Superior planet\\" refers to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (the latter two added later), which are farther from the Sun than Earth is. The terms are sometimes used more generally; for example, Earth is an inferior planet relative to Mars.  Other planetary terms  Interior planet now seems to be the preferred term for astronomers. Inferior/interior and superior are different from the terms inner planet and outer planet, which designate those planets which lie inside the asteroid belt and those that lie outside it, respectively. Inferior planet is also different from minor planet or dwarf planet. Superior planet is also different from gas giant.

The gens Valeria was a patrician family at ancient Rome, prominent from the very beginning of the Republic to the latest period of the Empire. Publius Valerius Poplicola was one of the consuls in 509 BC, the year that saw the overthrow of the Tarquins, and the members of his family were among the most celebrated statesmen and generals at the beginning of the Republic. Over the next ten centuries, few gentes produced as many distinguished men, and at every period the name of Valerius was constantly to be found in the lists of annual magistrates, and held in the highest honour. Several of the emperors claimed descent from the Valerii, whose name they bore as part of their official nomenclature.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 1215, 1216 (\\"Valeria Gens\\"). A number of unusual privileges attached to this family, including the right to burial within the city walls,Cicero, De Legibus ii. 23.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Publicola\\", 23. and a special place for its members in the Circus Maximus, where the unique honour of a throne was granted them.Livy, ii. 31. The house built by Poplicola at the foot of the Velian Hill was the only one whose doors were permitted to open into the street.Dionysius, v. 39.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Publicola\\", 20. The historian Niebuhr conjectured that, during the transition from the monarchy to the Republic, the Valerii were entitled to exercise royal power on behalf of the Titienses, one of the three Romulean tribes that made up the Roman people.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. i. p. 538. Although one of the most noble and illustrious families of the Roman aristocracy, from the very beginning the Valerii were notable for their advocacy of plebeian causes, and many important laws protecting the rights of the plebeians were sponsored by the Valerii.Dictionary of Antiquities, s. v. Leges Valeriae. As with many other ancient patrician houses, the family also acquired plebeian branches, which must have been descended either from freedmen of the Valerii, or from members of the family who, for one reason or another, had gone over to the plebeians. Origin According to tradition, the Valerii were of Sabine descent, having come to Rome with Titus Tatius, shortly after the founding of the city.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ii. 46.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Numa\\", 5, \\"The Life of Publicola\\", 1. However, their nomen, Valerius, is a patronymic surname derived from the Latin praenomen Volesus or Volusus, which in turn is derived from valere, to be strong.Chase, pp. 127, 129‚Äì132, 147, 148.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. valeo. Volesus, or Volesus Valerius, the eponymous ancestor of the gens, is said to have been a powerful warrior in the retinue of the Sabine king. Several generations later, another Volesus Valerius was the father of Publius, Marcus, and Manius, three brothers from whom the oldest branches of the family claimed descent.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1001 (\\"M'. Valerius Maximus\\"), vol. III, pp. 514 (\\"L. Valerius Potitus\\"), 600‚Äì602 (\\"Publicola, P. Valerius Publicola\\"), 1283 (\\"Volusus\\"). Praenomina The earliest of the Valerii known to history bore the praenomen Volesus, which continued to enjoy occasional use among the Valerii of the early Republic. However, most stirpes of the Valerii favoured Publius, Marcus, Manius, and Lucius. Several branches of the family also used Gaius, while the Valerii Faltones employed Quintus, and the Valerii Asiatici of imperial times used Decimus. Other names are seldom found among the Valerii, although in one instance Potitus, an ancient surname of the gens, was revived as a praenomen by the Valerii Messallae during the first century. Examples of Aulus, Numerius, Sextus, Tiberius, and Titus are found in inscriptions. Branches and cognomina The oldest branches of the Valerii bore the surnames Poplicola, Potitus, and Maximus, with Volusus being used by the first generations of the Potiti and Maximi. Later families bore various cognomina, including Corvus or Corvinus, Falto, Flaccus, Laevinus, Messalla, Tappo, and Triarius. Most other surnames found in Republican times belonged to freedmen or clientes of the Valerii. The surnames Acisculus, Catullus, Flaccus, and Barbatus appear on coins. A few Valerii are known without any cognomina, but they achieved little of significance. Poplicola, also found as Publicola and Poplicula, belongs to a class of surnames referring to the character of the bearer. Derived from populus and colo, the name might best be explained as \\"one who courts the people.\\"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 600 (\\"Publicola\\"),Chase, pp. 110, 111. The cognomen first appears in history as the surname given to Publius Valerius, one of the consuls chosen in 509 BC to serve alongside Lucius Junius Brutus. Despite his patrician background, he made a considerable effort to win the support of the plebeians, averting a breach between the two orders at the inception of the Republic.Livy, ii. 7, 8. Poplicola seems to have been the original form, while in inscriptions Publicola is more common, and Poplicula is occasionally found.Orelli, Inscriptionum Latinarum Selectarum Collectio n. 547. Publicola is found in literary sources from the end of the Republic, including Livy and Cicero. The Valerii Potiti were descended from Marcus Valerius Volusus, the brother of Poplicola, who fell in battle at Lake Regillus. The surname Potitus seems to be derived from potio, to place someone under one's power, and might be translated as \\"leader\\". This family flourished from the early years of the Republic down to the Samnite Wars, when the cognomen seems to have been replaced by Flaccus, a surname first borne by one of the Potiti, who must have been flabby or had floppy ears. Potitus was later revived as a praenomen by the Valerii Messallae, a practice that was common in aristocratic families toward the end of the Republic. As a distinct family, the Valerii Flacci continued down to the first century AD.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 514 (\\"Potitus\\"). Maximus, the superlative of magnus, \\"great\\", was the cognomen of the Valerii descended from the third brother, Manius Valerius Volusus, who first bore the surname. The Valerii Maximi appear in history down to the First Punic War, after which time the surname was replaced by Messalla or Messala, a cognomen derived from the city of Messana in Sicilia. The first to bear this name received it after relieving Messana from a Carthaginian blockade in 264 BC. The Valerii Messallae held numerous consulships and other high offices in the Roman state, remaining prominent well into imperial times. Some of them had additional surnames, including Barbatus, \\"bearded\\", as well as Niger and Rufus, originally referring to someone with black or red hair. The names Valerius Maximus and Valerius Messalla occur as late as the third century, but the consular family of that age may have been descended from the Valerii through the female line, and more properly belonged to the Vipstani.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 1001 (\\"M'. Valerius Maximus\\"), 1049 (\\"Messalla\\").Chase, pp. 109, 110 (\\"Barbatus, Niger, Rufus\\"), 111 (\\"Maximus\\"), 113, 114 (\\"Messala\\"). The branch of the Valerii Maximi that gave rise to the Messallae also bore the surname Corvinus, a diminutive of Corvus, a raven. The first of this family was Marcus Valerius Corvus, who in his youth earned everlasting renown for his combat against a giant Gaul in 349 BC. Corvus defeated his adversary with the help of a raven that repeatedly flew in the barbarian's face. He held the consulship six times, was dictator twice, and reached the age of one hundred. The two forms of this surname are interchangeable, but the hero is usually referred to as Corvus, while Corvinus generally refers to his descendants.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 861, 862 (\\"Corvus\\", \\"M. Valerius Corvus\\", Nos. 2, 3).Chase, pp. 112, 113. Another branch of the Valerii Maximi bore the surname Lactucinus, derived from Lactuca, lettuce, the cognomen of an early member of the family. Such names, referring to objects, were quite common at Rome. The first of this family was a son of the first Valerius Maximus, but the surname was of brief duration; the last mention of the Valerii Lactucinae is early in the fourth century BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1001 (\\"M. Valerius Maximus\\", Nos. 2, 3). The cognomen Laevinus, meaning \\"left-handed\\", belonged to a family of the Valerii that was prominent for about a century, beginning with the Pyrrhic War, in 280 BC. This family may have been another offshoot of the Valerii Maximi, as the surname first appears in connection with the trial of Spurius Cassius Viscellinus in 485 BC. They continued long after they had ceased to have any importance in the Roman state, and the family is mentioned as late as the end of the first century AD.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 709 (\\"Laevinus\\").Horace, Satirae, 1, 6, 12, Schol. Vet.Martial, i. 62, vi. 9.Chase, pp. 109, 110. The Valerii Faltones flourished at the end of the third century BC, first appearing at the end of the First Punic War. Their relationship to the other Valerii is not immediately apparent, as none of the older stirpes of the gens used the praenomen Quintus, but they may have been a cadet branch of the Valerii Maximi, whose surname disappears around this time. The surname Falto is another form of Falco, referring to a falcon, and was commonly given to someone with inward-pointing toes, resembling talons.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 135 (\\"Falto\\").New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. Falco. The plebeian Valerii Triarii belong to the time of Cicero, in the first century BC. None of them rose higher than the rank of praetor, and the family was of brief duration. Their surname, Triarius, seems to allude to their military service; in the Roman army of this period, a triarius was a soldier of the third rank, the heavily armed reserve infantry, often consisting of older, wealthier men, and the last line of defense in battle.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 1172, 1173 (\\"Valerius Triarius\\").New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. triarii. Catullus seems to be another orthography of Catulus, a surname of the Lutatia gens, referring to a whelp, cub, or puppy. The Valerii Catulli appear in the first century BC, beginning with the renowned poet, and their surname continued through the first century of the Empire. One of the Catulli bore the additional surname of Messalinus, previously associated with the Valerii Messallae, but it is unclear whether the Catulli were descended from the Messallae, or whether the surname entered the family at a later time. The pairing of Catullus Messalinus was also borne by one of the Valerii Asiatici, but again the nature of the relationship between these families is unknown.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. catulus. Asiaticus, the surname of the only major family of the Valerian gens to emerge in imperial times, belongs to a class of cognomina typically derived from the locations of military exploits.Chase, pp. 113, 114. In this instance the source of the name is not apparent, although it might allude to some connection with the Cornelii Scipiones; Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus was the younger brother of Scipio Africanus, and his surname was passed down in his family for several generations. The Valerii Asiatici were closely connected with the imperial family from the time of Caligula to that of Hadrian, and accounted for several consulships.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 1218 (\\"Valerius Asiaticus\\").

Roman gentes ","title":"Valeria gens"},{"id":"243447","text":"A solar transit of the Moon captured during calibration of the STEREO B spacecraft's ultraviolet imaging. The Moon appears much smaller than it does when seen from Earth, because the spacecraft‚ÄìMoon separation was several times greater than the Earth‚ÄìMoon distance. In astronomy, a transit (or astronomical transit) is a phenomenon when a celestial body passes directly between a larger body and the observer. As viewed from a particular vantage point, the transiting body appears to move across the face of the larger body, covering a small portion of it. The word \\"transit\\" refers to cases where the nearer object appears smaller than the more distant object. Cases where the nearer object appears larger and completely hides the more distant object are known as occultations. However, the probability of seeing a transiting planet is low because it is dependent on the alignment of the three objects in a nearly perfectly straight line. Many parameters of a planet and its parent star can be determined based on the transit.  In the Solar System  A simulation of Io transiting Jupiter as seen from the Earth in February 2009. Io's shadow is seen on the surface of Jupiter, leading Io slightly due to the sun and Earth not being in the same line. One example of a transit involves the motion of a planet between a terrestrial observer and the Sun. This can happen only with inferior planets, namely Mercury and Venus (see transit of Mercury and transit of Venus). However, because a transit is dependent on the point of observation, the Earth itself transits the Sun if observed from Mars. In the solar transit of the Moon captured during calibration of the STEREO B spacecraft's ultraviolet imaging, the Moon appears much smaller than it does when seen from Earth, because the spacecraft‚ÄìMoon separation was several times greater than the Earth‚ÄìMoon distance. The term can also be used to describe the motion of a satellite across its parent planet, for instance one of the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) across Jupiter, as seen from Earth. Although rare, cases where four bodies are lined up do happen. One of these events occurred on 27 June 1586, when Mercury transited the Sun as seen from Venus at the same time as a transit of Mercury from Saturn and a transit of Venus from Saturn. = Notable observations = No missions were planned to coincide with the transit of Earth visible from Mars on 11 May 1984 and the Viking missions had been terminated a year previously. Consequently, the next opportunity to observe such an alignment will be in 2084. On 21 December 2012, the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens probe, in orbit around Saturn, observed the planet Venus transiting the Sun.Cassini Spacecraft Tracks Venus Transit From Saturn, Space Coast Daily. Retrieved on 8 February 2016. On 3 June 2014, the Mars rover Curiosity observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth. = Mutual planetary transits = In rare cases, one planet can pass in front of another. If the nearer planet appears smaller than the more distant one, the event is called a mutual planetary transit.

Outside the Solar System  Exoplanet Detection 333x333px The transit method can be used to discover exoplanets. As a planet eclipses/transits its host star it will block a portion of the light from the star. If the planet transits in-between the star and the observer the change in light can be measured to construct a light curve. Light curves are measured with a charged-coupled device. The light curve of a star can disclose several physical characteristics of the planet and star, such as density. Multiple transit events must be measured to determine the characteristics which tend to occur at regular intervals. Multiple planets orbiting the same host star can cause transit-timing variations (TTV). TTV is caused by the gravitational forces of all orbiting bodies acting upon each other. The probability of seeing a transit from Earth is low, however. The probability is given by the following equation. P_\\\\text{transit}= (R_\\\\text{star} + R_\\\\text{planet})/a Rstar and Rplanet are the radius of the star and planet, respectively. The semi major axis length is represented by a. Because of low probability, large selections of the sky must be regularly observed in order to see a transit. Hot Jupiters are more likely to be seen because of their larger radius and short semi major. In order to find earth-sized planets, red dwarf stars are observed because of their small radius. Even though transiting has a low probability it has proven itself to be a good technique for discovering exoplanets. In recent years, the discovery of extrasolar planets has prompted interest in the possibility of detecting their transits across their own stellar primaries. HD 209458b was the first such transiting planet to be detected. The transit of celestial objects is one of the few key phenomena used today for the study of exoplanetary systems. Today, transit photometry is the leading form of exoplanet discovery. As an exoplanet moves in front of its host star there is a dimming in the luminosity of the host star that can be measured. Larger planets make the dip in luminosity more noticeable and easier to detect. Followup observations using other methods are often carried out to ensure it is a planet. There are currently (December 2018) 2345 planets confirmed with Kepler light curves for stellar host. center  Contacts  During a transit there are four \\"contacts\\", when the circumference of the small circle (small body disk) touches the circumference of the large circle (large body disk) at a single point. Historically, measuring the precise time of each point of contact was one of the most accurate ways to determine the positions of astronomical bodies. The contacts happen in the following order: *First contact: the smaller body is entirely outside the larger body, moving inward (\\"exterior ingress\\") *Second contact: the smaller body is entirely inside the larger body, moving further inward (\\"interior ingress\\") *Third contact: the smaller body is entirely inside the larger body, moving outward (\\"interior egress\\") *Fourth contact: the smaller body is entirely outside the larger body, moving outward (\\"exterior egress\\") A fifth named point is that of greatest transit, when the apparent centers of the two bodies are nearest to each other, halfway through the transit.  Missions  Since transit photometry allows for scanning large celestial areas with a simple procedure, it has been the most popular and successful form of finding exoplanets in the past decade and includes many projects, some of which have already been retired, others in use today, and some in progress of being planned and created. The most successful projects include HATNet, KELT, Kepler, and WASP, and some new and developmental stage missions such as TESS, HATPI, and others which can be found among the List of Exoplanet Search Projects. = HATNet = HATNet Project is a set of northern telescopes in Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, Arizona and Mauna Kea Observatories, HI, and southern telescopes around the globe, in Africa, Australia, and South America, under the HATSouth branch of the project. These are small aperture telescopes, just like KELT, and look at a wide field which allows them to scan a large area of the sky for possible transiting planets. I addition, their multitude and spread around the world allows for 24/7 observation of the sky so that more short-period transits can be caught. A third sub-project, HATPI, is currently under construction and will survey most of the night sky seen from its location in Chile. = KELT = KELT is a terrestrial telescope mission designed to search for transiting systems of planets of magnitude 8 KELT North observes \\"26-degree wide strip of sky that is overhead from North America during the year\\", while KELT South observes single target areas of the size 26 by 26 degrees. Both telescopes can detect and identify transit events as small as a 1% flux dip, which allows for detection of planetary systems similar to those in our planetary system. = Kepler / K2 = The Kepler satellite served the Kepler mission between 7 March 2009 and 11 May 2013, where it observed one part of the sky in search of transiting planets within a 115 square degrees of the sky around the Cygnus, Lyra, and Draco constellations. After that, the satellite continued operating until 15 November 2018, this time changing its field along the ecliptic to a new area roughly every 75 days due to reaction wheel failure. = TESS = TESS was launched on 18 April 2018, and is planned to survey most of the sky by observing it strips defined along the right ascension lines for 27 days each. Each area surveyed is 27 by 90 degrees. Because of the positioning of sections, the area near TESS's rotational axis will be surveyed for up to 1 year, allowing for the identification of planetary systems with longer orbital periods.

It was built on Hven, an island in the √òresund between Zealand and Scania, Sweden, which was part of Denmark at the time. It was expanded with the underground facility Stjerneborg on an adjacent site. Brahe also innovated and invented many precision instruments which he used to carry out his studies in the observatory. Research was done in the fields of astronomy, alchemy, and meteorology by Tycho and his assistants. Brahe abandoned Uraniborg and Stjerneborg in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king; he left the country, and the institution was destroyed in 1601 after his death. Hven was later lost to Sweden, and the Rundet√•rn (Round Tower) in Copenhagen was inaugurated in 1642 as a replacement for Uraniborg's astronomical functions. Uraniborg's grounds are currently being restored. History The building was dedicated to Urania, the Muse of Astronomy, and it was named Uraniborg, \\"The Castle of Urania\\". It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe, though not the last to be built without a telescope as its primary instrument. The cornerstone was laid on August 8, 1576. The sandstone and limestone-framed brick building was constructed from the year 1576 to 1580. Built in the Flemish Renaissance style, the erection of the site was overseen by Danish architect Hans van Emden and sculptor Johan Gregor van der Schardt. The main building of Uraniborg was square, about 15 meters on a side, and built mostly of red brick. Two semi-circular towers, one each on the north and south sides of the main building, gave the building a somewhat rectangular footprint overall. The plan and fa√ßade of the building, and also the plan of the surrounding gardens, are designed on grids, with proportions that Tycho carefully specified. These proportions may have been intended to make Uraniborg function as an astrological talisman, benefiting the health of its occupants by increasing the influences of the sun and Jupiter. The main floor consisted of four rooms, one of which was occupied by Brahe and his family, the other three for visiting astronomers. The northern tower housed the kitchens, and the southern a library. The second floor was divided into three rooms, two of equal size and one larger. The larger room was reserved for visiting royalty; James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) visited on March 20, 1590. On this level the towers housed the primary astronomical instruments, accessed from outside the building or from doors on this floor. Balconies, supported on wooden posts, housed additional instruments slightly further from the building, giving them a wider angle of view. On the third floor was a loft, subdivided into eight smaller rooms for students. Only the roofs of the towers reached this level, although a single additional tower extended above the loft in the middle of the building, similar to a widow's walk, accessed via a spiral staircase from the 3rd floor. Uraniborg also featured a large basement; it housed an alchemical laboratory at one end, and storage for food, salt and fuel at the other.\\"Uraniborg ‚Äì Observatory, Laboratory and Castle\\" Engraving of the mural quadrant from Brahe's book Astronomiae instauratae mechanica (1598) The observatory had a large mural quadrant affixed to a north‚Äìsouth wall, used to measure the altitude of stars as they passed the meridian. This, along with many other instruments of the observatory, was depicted and described in detail in Brahe's 1598 book Astronomiae instauratae mechanica. A large wall, 75 meters on a side and 5.5 meters high, was planned to surround Uraniborg, but was never built; instead, a high earth mound was constructed. That mound has lasted until modern times, being the only remnant of the observatory still in place. Uraniborg was located in the very middle, with an extensive parterre garden between the mound walls and the building. In addition to being decorative, the gardens also supplied herbs for Brahe's medicinal chemistry experiments. The gardens are currently being re-created, using seeds found on- site or identified in Brahe's writings. At the gatehouses, Tycho incorporated his printing workshop and the island's prison. Extending beyond the walls, Uraniborg's surrounding infrastructure included a system of aquaculture ponds, whose overflow powered a paper mill.\\"Uraniborg ‚Äì The Papermill\\" In 1590 James VI of Scotland gave gold coins to builders and workmen at the paper and corn mills.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 45. Uraniborg was an extremely expensive project. It is estimated that it cost about 1% of the entire state budget during construction. Upon losing financial support from Frederick II's successor, Christian IV of Denmark, Brahe abandoned Hven in 1597. The new king was not a fan of Brahe and due to loss of popularity and funding at court, both astrological sites were destroyed shortly after Brahe's death. Stjerneborg was the subject of archaeological excavations during the 1950s, resulting in the restoration of the observatory.Google Map of Uraniborg (and to the south across the road, Stjerneborg) Stjerneborg now houses a multimedia show.  Research  Uraniborg was a place for the study of astronomy, meteorology, astrology, and alchemy. Over the life span of Uraniborg it had upwards of thirty different assistants for Tycho Brahe, and visits from many other researchers and royalty; Johannes Kepler, Martin Zeiler, Nicolaus Reimers, Erik Lange, and David Wunderer being some of the noted visitors. At its best, Brahe's data was accurate up to a minute of arc, an improvement of ten times compared to what was previously available. In 1577 Brahe, while tracking the comet of 1577, he saw inaccuracies with the location of stars in both Ptolemy's and Copernicus's systems . From then Brahe sought after a better celestial map. Using both mathematics and observation from Uraniborg, Tycho Brahe released his first model of the celestial night in 1588, the Tychonic system. Brahe's system had Earth stationary in the center, the moon and sun revolving around it, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolving around the sun, and the outer most circle where the stars rotate around. Paul Wittich visited Uraniborg for several months in 1580 and aided Brahe in the construction of the Tychonic system. Brahe had also researched meteorology for the King of Denmark, Frederick II, although Brahe did not put his name on the publications. During the period in which Uraniborg was actively used, astronomy and astrology were thought to be linked to the other scientific fields, and as such the observatory was used to discover more than the astral bodies. While Brahe openly shared his findings in the field of astronomy and meteorology, he did not openly share his work in alchemy. Brahe's under ground laboratory was designed to allow sunlight in throughout the day and had furnaces arranged so he could do his research even in the coldest months. Though he did not publicly publish his findings, he did give them as gifts to other people of power. Jean Picard, known for measuring lines of longitude, revisited the ruins of Uraniborg in 1671. He recorded the longitude and latitude of Uraniborg so astronomers could compare their research to Tycho's. Picard also went back to Uraniborg to study atmospheric refraction, which is the bending of light due to the atmosphere. Shortly after construction it became clear that the tower-mounted instruments were too easily moved by wind, and Brahe set about constructing a more suitable observation site. The result was Stjerneborg (\\"castle of the stars\\"), a smaller site built entirely at ground level and dedicated purely to observations (there was no \\"house\\"). The basic layout was similar to Uraniborg, with a wall of similar shape surrounding the site, although the enclosed area was much smaller. The instruments were all placed underground, covered by opening shutters or a rotating dome in buildings built over the instrument pits. The research done at Stjerneborg paralleled the work done at Uraniborg but their notes were kept separate so that the research gathered at the observatories could be used to ensure that all of the data was accurate. Work had been started to connect Stjerneburg to the Tycho's chemistry laboratory under Uraniborg but the tunnel was never completed.  Instruments  Brahe's 1581 armillary sphere. The observatory was not just the home of scientists, but it also supported the artisans who constructed the tools that the scientists needed. Tycho Brahe was an innovative astronomer of his time. Within the Uraniborg observatory, he utilized innovative observing methods and built new instruments to improve the accuracy of his readings. Brahe's goal to gather accurate data on the cosmos influenced the creation of a wide range of contraptions to prove his theories on the celestial positions and a geo-heliocentric (Tychonic) model of the solar system, a theory that the earth is the center of the sun and moon while the sun is also the center of the other planets. He upsized his instruments; one of the surviving instruments being the Brass Azimuthal Quadrant created in 1576. Instead of using wood like with previous models, he built the new one out of metal and masonry to enhance its stability and therefore improve the accuracy of his measurements. The azimuthal quadrant was meant to observe the Great Comet of 1577 with an accuracy of 48.8 seconds of an arc. He also used highly refined lenses and optical equipment in conjunction with other instruments, such as sextants and armillary spheres. To increase the accuracy of his readings further, he utilized the equatorial coordinate system instead of the zodiacal coordinate system with his specially designed instruments. In 1580, Brahe created the Great Globe, a hollow, wooden sphere layered with brass plates to document the stars and planets he observed. By the year 1595, over 1,000 stars had been etched onto the globe; 777 of these were placed over the majority of Brahe's time at Uraniborg, and the last 223 just before he left. He and his assistants also tracked the movements of the planets over two decades. Brahe then created the Triangular Sextant in 1582. This device was around 3.2 meters in diameter and was fixed in one place instead of being mobile like the smaller versions. Three years later Brahe created a larger instrument called the Great Equatorial Armillary which allowed him to gauge planetary and stellar positions. This device was able to compensate for atmospheric refraction and it remained consistent with its measurements over time. Additionally, the structure itself and installation of the instruments was innovative for its time and was pivotal in the accuracy of the instruments. For instance, the upgraded mural quadrant, made from metal and stone, was fixed in place as a wall. This allowed for further accuracy in the measurements recorded by Brahe. The other smaller instruments that were more sensitive to interference from the weather repositioning were also fixed in place; they were installed in recesses in the ground to provide greater protection from the wind while still having the ability to measure stellar features. The observatory was also designed so that any exposed instruments on the upper levels of the towers were well protected from exposure.  Restoration  A proposal was done in order to start the reconstruction of the original Uraniborg site during the 1980s. Restoration of the surrounding gardens began in 1985 with the goal of replanting of 16th century garden. Archaeological studies of the plant material were done by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the Landskrona Department of Culture in order to determine the plant type and location. Later in the year of 1992, a reconstruction plan for around one-quarter on the ramparts was created. This reconstruction plan included details on the ongoing work that also included the planted hypothesis on the structures, the plant material, and acquisitions and forms during the 1580s and 1590s. The new site now includes a restored quarter of Brahe's original garden with plants and herbs laid out in beds that are also boxed in with a wooden fence. A fruit orchard was also placed within the center of the pavilion.

F. Strawson, was an English philosopher. He was the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at the University of Oxford (Magdalen College) from 1968 to 1987. Before that, he was appointed as a college lecturer at University College, Oxford, in 1947, and became a tutorial fellow the following year, until 1968. On his retirement in 1987, he returned to the college and continued working there until shortly before his death. His portrait was painted by the artists Muli Tang and Daphne Todd. When he died, the obituary in The Guardian noted that \\"Oxford was the world capital of philosophy between 1950 and 1970, and American academics flocked there, rather than the traffic going the other way. That golden age had no greater philosopher than Sir Peter Strawson.\\"The Guardian ‚Äì Obituary Early years Strawson was born in Ealing, west London, and brought up in Finchley, north London, by his parents, both of whom were teachers. He was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, followed by St John's College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Philosophical work Strawson first became well known with his article \\"On Referring\\" (1950), a criticism of Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions (see also Definite descriptions) that Russell explained in the famous \\"On Denoting\\" article (1905). In philosophical methodology, there are (at least) two important and interrelated features of Strawson's work that are worthy of note.P.F. Strawson, Individuals The first is the project of a 'descriptive' metaphysics, and the second is his notion of a shared conceptual scheme, composed of concepts operated in everyday life. In his book Individuals (1959), Strawson attempts to give a description of various concepts that form an interconnected web, representing (part of) our common, shared, human conceptual scheme. In particular, he examines our conceptions of basic particulars, and how they are variously brought under general spatio-temporal concepts. What makes this a metaphysical project is that it exhibits, in fine detail, the structural features of our thought about the world, and thus precisely delimits how we, humans, think about reality. Strawson was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1960 and Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1969 to 1970. He was knighted, in 1977, for services to philosophy. Personal life After serving as a captain in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during World War II, Strawson married Ann Martin in 1945. They had four children, including the philosopher Galen Strawson. P.F. Strawson lived in Oxford all his adult life and died in hospital on 13 February 2006 after a short illness. He was elder brother to Major General John Strawson. Partial bibliography =Books= * Introduction to Logical Theory. London: Methuen, 1952. * Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics.

If more than two people are involved, it may be referred to as a group hug. Etymology The origins of the word are unknown, but two theories exist. The first is that the verb \\"hug\\" (first used in the 1560s) could be related to the Old Norse word hugga, which meant to comfort. The second theory is that the word is related to the German word hegen, which means to foster or cherish, and originally meant to enclose with a hedge. Characteristics A hug after a volleyball match in Canada A hug after a concert in the United States. A hug, sometimes in association with a kiss, is a form of nonverbal communication. Depending on culture, context and relationship, a hug can indicate familiarity, love, affection, friendship, brotherhood or sympathy. A hug can indicate support, comfort, and consolation, particularly where words are insufficient. A hug usually demonstrates affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising from joy or happiness when reunited with someone or seeing someone absent after a long time. A non-reciprocal hug may demonstrate a relational problem. A hug can range from a brief one-second squeeze, with the arms not fully around the friend, to an extended holding. The length of a hug in any situation is socially and culturally determined. In the case of lovers, and occasionally others, the hips may also be pressed together. The emotionality of the hug furthermore influences the direction of the hug. In deeply emotional contexts, hugs tend to be more left-sided compared to hugs in neutral situations such as greetings. While the overall direction of hugs corresponds with physical motor phenotypes such as handedness, the emotional state induces an overall shift to the left attributed to right-hemispheric emotional processing. Unlike some other types of physical contact, a hug can be practiced publicly and privately without stigma in many countries, religions and cultures, within families, and also across age and gender lines, but is generally an indication that people are familiar with each other. Moving from a handshake (or touch-free) relationship to a hug relationship is a sign of a closer friendship. An unexpected hug can be regarded as an invasion of a person's personal space, but if it is reciprocated it is an indication that it is welcome. Some Western culture commentators advise avoiding hugs at work to prevent uncomfortable moments, especially with people who dislike hugging. Also, a person, especially a child, may caress and hug a doll or stuffed animal. Young children also hug their parents when they feel threatened by an unfamiliar person, although this may be regarded as clinging onto rather than hugging because it demonstrates a need for protection rather than affection. Cultural aspects A hug in Argentina A hug after a basketball game in the United States. While less common, hugging may be undertaken as part of a ritual or social act in certain social groups. It is a custom in some cultures such as France, Spain and Latin America for male friends to hug (as well as slap each other on the back) in a joyous greeting.William Cane, The Art of Hugging: The World-Famous Kissing Coach Offers Inspiration and Advice on Why, Where, and How to Hug, St. Martin's Griffin, US, 2013 A similar hug, usually accompanied by a kiss on the cheek, is also becoming a custom among Western women at meeting or parting. In Portugal and Brazil, it is common, mostly among males, to finish letters and emails with Um abra√ßo or Abra√ßo (\\"a hug\\", or \\"hug\\") followed by the sender's signature. Similar formulas may be used in oral communication. In the Roman Catholic rite of the Holy Mass a hug may be substituted for a kiss or handshake during the kiss of peace ritual. In May 2009, The New York Times reported that \\"the hug has become the favorite social greeting when teenagers meet or part these days\\" in the United States. A number of schools in the United States have issued bans on hugs, which in some cases have resulted in student-led protests against these bans. A Canadian journalistic investigation in 2015 noted the popularity of the hug in bromance among young francophone adults in Quebec.Lili Boisvert, radio-canada.ca, Bromance : ces gars qui craquent pour leurs amis , Canada, January 19, 2015 Some cultures do not use hugging as a sign of affection or love, such as the Himba in Namibia. During the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, it is halal (permissible) for someone to hug one's significant other during daylight hours if one has self-control. However, if accompanied by libidinous urges, it is haram (sinful). In the south Indian state of Kerala a sixteen-year-old boy was expelled from school for hugging a girl after she won a prize at an arts competition. When the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights ordered the school to re-enroll the boy, it was challenged in the High Court. The Court nullified the Commission's order and upheld the school principal's order to expel the student, saying \\"The school principal is the institution‚Äôs guardian, vested with powers to take action necessary to maintain discipline and morality in the school. The child rights commission cannot interfere there.\\" Health benefits Hugging has been proven to have health benefits. One study has shown that hugs increase levels of oxytocin and reduce blood pressure. Based on significant research indicating that a 20-second-or-longer hug releases oxytocin. Leo Buscaglia encourages people to hug for 21 days consecutively and to have each day a hug that lasts for a minimum of 21 seconds. He recommends \\"getting lost in the hug,\\" encouraging people to slow down and \\"use the power of the hug to be fully present in the moment\\". Group hug  A group hug among young men, showing their close friendship A group hug has been found to be a useful tool in group therapy to cement a sense of cohesion among the participants after a session,Albert Pesso, Movement in Psychotherapy: Psychomotor Techniques and Training (1969), pp. 92‚Äì93. although it may cause discomfort for group members who shy away from physical contact.  Cuddling  A hug during a concert in Italy. Marcus Stewart and Felicity Doyle embrace in Oresteia by Aeschylus, adapted by Ryan Castalia for Stairwell Theater, 2019 Cuddling is a related form of physical intimacy in which two people hold one another with each other's arms wrapped around the other's body for an extended period of time. Cuddling can be with family members, friends or lovers. Similar to hugging, cuddling is a more affectionate and intimate embrace, normally done for a longer period of time (usually lasting from a few minutes to several hours). In contrast to hugging, which can often be a nonverbal greeting or parting tradition, cuddling is usually shared between two people who are lying down together or sitting somewhere in an intimate manner. Like hugging, cuddling makes the body release oxytocin, which has a variety of effects.

History  The GAB was established in 1962, when the governments of eight International Monetary Fund (IMF) members-- Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States--and the central banks of two others, Germany and Sweden, agreed to make resources available to the IMF with an additional $6 billion of their resources. The additional money was intended to allow the IMF to have increased lending resources. In 1964, the funds were used by the IMF to rescue the pound sterling. The G-10 grew in 1964 by the association of the eleventh member, Switzerland, then not a member of the IMF, but the name of the group remained the same.  Activities  The GAB enables the IMF to borrow specified amounts of currencies from these eleven industrial countries (or their central banks), under certain circumstances. Specifically, a proposal for calls under the GAB may only be made when a proposal for the establishment of an activation period under the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) is not accepted by NAB participants, who number 38 countries, amongst which are the BRICS nations and Middle Eastern powers. The potential amount of credit available to the IMF under the GAB totals SDR 17bn (about $26bn), with an additional SDR 1.5bn available under an associated arrangement with Saudi Arabia. The GAB was established in 1962 and expanded in 1983 to SDR 17bn, from about SDR 6bn. It has been activated ten times, the last time in 1998. The GAB and the associated credit arrangement with Saudi Arabia have been renewed, without modifications, for a period of five years from December 26, 2013.imf.org: Factsheet - IMF Standing Borrowing Arrangements, 30 Apr 2014 The BIS hosts a publications e-library page for the G-10. = Observers = The following international organizations are official observers of the activities of the G10: the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), European Commission, International Monetary Fund, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
