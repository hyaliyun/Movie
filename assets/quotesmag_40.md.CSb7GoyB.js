In 2012 Connecticut's 22 breweries and brewpubs employed 430 people directly, and 12,000 others in related jobs such as wholesaling and retailing. Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply Connecticut's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by Connecticut's breweries and related industries was more than $375 million. Consumer purchases of Connecticut's brewery products generated another $105 million in tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, Connecticut ranked 33rd in the number of craft breweries per capita with 21. For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries. In that same year, according to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry employed around 43,000 Americans in brewing and distribution and had a combined economic impact of more than $246 billion.

Wainwright (1963), Brady v. Maryland (1963), and Duncan v. Louisiana (1968). The United States Constitution contains several provisions regarding the law of criminal procedure. Petit jury and venue provisions--both traceable to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence--are included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions are contained in the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With the exception of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments. Several of these rights regulate pre-trial procedure: access to a non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, the right to an information (charging document), the right to a speedy trial, and the right to be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding. If a defendant is convicted, the usual remedy for a violation of one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions. Relevant text The U.S. Bill of Rights Article Three, Section Two, Clause Three of the United States Constitution provides that: :Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Art. III, ¬ß 2, cl. 3. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that: :No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . . amend. V. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. amend. VI. The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that: :Excessive bail shall not be required . . . . amend. VIII. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that: :[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. amend. XIV. History The Supreme Court of the United States issued almost no constitutional criminal procedure decisions for its first century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment.Amar, 1996, at 1124. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.Amar, 1996, at 1124-25; see Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, ¬ß 5, 26 Stat. 826, 827. The Marshall Court possessed jurisdiction in criminal cases only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause.United States v. Nickerson, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 204 (1854); United States v. Randenbush, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 288, 290 (1834); United States v. Wilson, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 150, 159-60 (1833); United States v. Perez, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824). Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.United States v. Mills, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 138 (1833); United States v. Gooding, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 460, 473-75 (1827). In two appeals from state courts, the Taney Court considered, and rejected, double jeopardy claims arising from the hypothetical prospect of prosecution by the federal and state governments for the same conduct.Moore v. Illinois, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 13 (1852); Fox v. Ohio, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 410 (1847). The first Supreme Court decisions to reverse state criminal convictions for constitutional procedural reasons involved the exclusion of African-Americans for grand and petit juries --Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), Virginia v. Rives (1880), Neal v. Delaware (1881), Carter v. Texas (1900), Rogers v. Alabama (1904), and Norris v. Alabama (1935)--and the conviction African-American defendants for crimes involving white victims in the southern states: by a mob-dominated trial, as in Moore v. Dempsey (1923); and without counsel, as in Powell v. Alabama (1932).Michael J. Klarman, The Racial Origins of Modern Criminal Procedure, 99 48 (2000). Pre-trial procedure Bail U.S. Const. amend. VIII provides: :Excessive bail shall not be required . . . . Stack v. Boyle (1951) is the only case in which the Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally excessive. There, the Court found $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act.Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951). In United States v. Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987). The incorporation status of the Excessive Bail Clause is unclear. In Schilb v. Kuebel (1971), the Court stated in dicta: \\"Bail, of course, is basic to our system of law, and the Eighth Amendment's proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"Schilb v. Kuebel, 404 U.S. 357 (1971). In Murphy v. Hunt (1982), the Court did not reach the issue because the case was dismissed as moot.Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478 (1982). Bail was included in the list of incorporated rights in McDonald v. Chicago (2010), citing Schilb.McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S. Ct. 3020, 3034 n.12 (2010). Grand Jury A grand jury in 1913 U.S. Const. amend. V provides: :No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger . . . . The Grand Jury Clause applies only to capital and \\"otherwise infamous\\" crimes. Any crime \\"punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary\\" is infamous.Mackin v. United States, 117 U.S. 348, 352 (1886) (\\"[I]mprisonment in a State prison or penitentiary, with or without hard labor, is an infamous punishment.\\"); see also Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417, 429 (1885) (\\"[A] crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of years at hard labor is an infamous crime . . . .\\"). Only those convicted of felonies, i.e. crimes punishable by greater than one year of imprisonment, are confined to a penitentiary. Any crime punishable by hard labor, regardless of the term or place of imprisonment, is also infamous.United States v. Moreland, 258 U.S. 433 (1922); see also Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228 (1896). Contempt of court, even if punished by greater than one year imprisonment, is not infamous.Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 183-87 (1958). In Hurtado v. California (1884), the Supreme Court held that the Grand Jury Clause was not incorporated to apply to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); For later cases adhering to Hurtado, see Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 545-55 (1962); Lem Woon v. Oregon, 229 U.S. 586 (1913); Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581 (1900); McNulty v. California, 149 U.S. 645, 648 (1893). If the grand jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be submitted to the grand jury.Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212 (1960). Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury.Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 (1887), overruled in part by United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002). But, the government may narrow the indictment without so returning.United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130 (2007). The Grand Jury Clause does very little, if anything, to regulate the procedures of the grand jury. For example, the Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence.Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359 (1956). Non-fundamental flaws with the grand jury, such as a violation of the defendant's self-incrimination rightsLawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 349 (1958). or a violation of grand jury secrecyMidland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 802 (1989). do not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have required \\"substantial exculpatory evidence\\" to be presented to the grand jury, the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation.United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 45 (1992). The lack of a grand jury does not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the grand jury right.United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002). Information U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation . . . . A charging instrument is constitutionally sufficient under this clause (and under the Grand Jury Clause) if it (1) \\"contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,\\" and (2) \\"shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead\\" double jeopardy in a subsequent prosecution.Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 763-64 (1962) (internal quotation marks omitted). This right has been incorporated.Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196 (1948). In a case submitted to a grand jury, the indictment must satisfy this requirement. In cases not required to be submitted to a grand jury, the formal charging instrument is referred to as an \\"information\\" (in the federal system and in some states) or a \\"complaint.\\" Speedy trial U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial . . . . The Speedy Trial Clause regulates delay between the bringing of a formal criminal charge and/or the pre-trial deprivation of the accused's liberty and the start of trial.United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S. 302 (1986); United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1 (1982); United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783 (1977). The Clause has been incorporated to apply in state prosecutions.Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213 (1967). In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court announced four factors relevant to the determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the defendant demanded a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice.Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972); see also United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307 (1971); Dickey v. Florida, 398 U.S. 30 (1970); Smith v. Hooey, 393 U.S. 374 (1969); United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116 (1966). Applying Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest.Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647 (1992). The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.Strunk v. United States, 412 U.S. 434 (1973). Venue The Declaration of Independence accused King George III of \\"transporting us beyond Seas to be tried\\" U.S. Const. Art. III, ¬ß 2, cl. 3 provides: :Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. The perceived abuse of English criminal venue law was one of the enumerated grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence, which accused George III of the United Kingdom of \\"transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses.\\"U.S. Declaration of Independence. The \\"where the said Crimes shall have been committed\\" language refers to the locus delicti. \\"[T]he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\\"United States v. Cabrales, 524 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1998) (quoting United States v. Anderson, 328 U.S. 699, 703 (1946)). Thus, a single crime may often give rise to several constitutionally permissible venues, and venue may be constitutionally permissible even if an individual defendant was never personally present in the relevant state.Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634-35 (1961); United States v. Cores, 356 U.S. 405, 407 (1958); Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U.S. 56, 76-77 (1908); Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344, 387-89 (1906); Horner v. United States, 143 U.S. 207, 213-14 (1892); Palliser v. United States, 136 U.S. 257, 265-66 (1890). For example, conspiracy may be prosecuted wherever the agreement occurred or wherever any overt act was committed.Hyde v. Shine, 199 U.S. 62, 76-78 (1905); Dealy v. United States, 152 U.S. 539, 546-47 (1894); Palliser, 136 U.S. at 265-66. For the purposes of constitutional venue, the boundaries of the states are questions of law to be determined by the judge, but the location of the crime is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.United States v. Jackalow, 66 U.S. (1 Black) 484 (1861). The venue provision of Article III (regulating the location of the trial) is distinct from the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment (regulating the geography from which the jury pool is selected). The unit of the former is the state; the unit of the later is the state and judicial district. Unlike judicial districts under the Vicinage Clause, consistent with Article III, Congress may \\"provide a place of trial where none was provided when the offense was committed, or change the place of trial after the commission of the offense.\\"Cook v. United States, 138 U.S. 157, 183 (1891); see also United States v. Dawson, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 467, 487-88 (1853). Trial procedure Compulsory process U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . . . . The Compulsory Process Clause guarantees the defendant the right to obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses.Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967). Similarly, the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense.United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858 (1982). The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400 (1988). Confrontation Crawford v. Washington (2004) referred to Sir Walter Raleigh's (pictured) inability to cross-examine Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham as one of the \\"most notorious instances of civil-law examination.\\"Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 44 (2004). U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . . In Crawford v. Washington (2004), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the \\"admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial\\" unless pursuant to one of the \\"exceptions established at the time of the founding.\\"Crawford, 541 U.S. at 53-54. \\"[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements . . . so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\\" In Davis v. Washington (2006), the Court held that the Clause places no restrictions on nontestimonial statements.Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 823-26 (2006). Crawford did not completely define the term \\"testimonial.\\"Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68 (\\"We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of 'testimonial.'\\"). But, Crawford held that, \\"[w]hatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\\"Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68. Laboratory reports of forensic tests are also testimonial, conferring on the defendant a right to cross-examine the analyst who certifies them.Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011); Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009). But see Williams v. Illinois, No. 10‚Äì8505 (U.S. June 18, 2012). Statements made during police interrogation are nontestimonial if circumstances objectively indicate \\"that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\\" but are tesitmonial if circumstances objective indicate \\"that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\\"Davis, 547 U.S. at 822. \\"[T]he relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals' statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\\"Michigan v. Bryant, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 1156 (2011). One exception established at the founding is if the witness is \\"unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\\"Crawford, 541 U.S. at 54; Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto.) 145, 160-61 (1878). Another such exception is \\"forfeiture by wrongdoing,\\" i.e. where the defendant intends to obtain and obtains the absence of the witness by wrongdoing.Giles v. California, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 2683-88 (2008); Davis, 547 U.S. at 833-34; Crawford, 541 U.S. at 62; Reynolds, 98 U.S. at 158-60. Still another exception is \\"the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\\"Crawford, 541 U.S. at 59 n.9. Another possible exception is for dying declarations, i.e. statements made by a speaker on the brink of death while aware that he or she is dying.Bryant, 131 S. Ct. at 1151 n.1; Giles, 128 S. Ct. at 2682-83; Crawford, 541 U.S. at 56 n.6. Petit jury, impartiality, and vicinage An empty jury box U.S. Const. Art. III, ¬ß 2, cl. 3 provides: :Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury . . . . U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . One of the enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence accused King George III of \\"depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury.\\" ;Availability Depending on the authorized and actual sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant has a right to trial by jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution.United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 718 F.2d 1210 (2d Cir. 1983). If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant has a right to a jury.Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 117 (1970); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506 (1974); Taylor v. Haynes, 418 U.S. 488 (1974). But, the defendant does not have a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not.Lewis v. United States, 518 U.S. 322 (1996). Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness, but so far the Court has pushed back against expanding the jury right.Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U.S. 538 (1989); United States v. Nachtigal, 507 U.S. 1 (1993). ;Impartiality The trial judge has an obligation to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions.Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U,S. 333 (1966); but see Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415 (1991); Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794 (1975); Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541 (1962); Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162 (1950). For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire on the subject of the juror's potential racial prejudice.Turner v. Murray, 476 U.S. 28 (1986); Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524 (1973); Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308 (1931); but see Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182 (1981); Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589 (1976). In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723 (1963); Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 (1961); but see Skilling v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 2896, 2912-25 (2010). The Sixth Amendment also regulates the availability and use of cause and peremptory challenges. For example, it precludes a jurisdiction from granting the prosecution for-cause removal of jurors who oppose the death penalty.Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968); see also Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719 (1992); Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U.S. 648 (1987); Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162 (1986); Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985); Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38 (1980). \\"The most that can be demanded of a venireman in this regard is that he be willing to consider all of the penalties provided by state law, and that he not be irrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings.\\"Witherspoon, 391 U.S. at 522 n.21. While a defendant is not obliged to use peremptory challenges to cure a trial court's erroneous denial of a defendant's for-cause challenge, if the defendant does so, the defendant may not rely on the error for automatic reversal.United States v. Martinez- Salazar, 528 U.S. 304 (2000); Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 81 (1988). ;Size and unanimity The Supreme Court has held that six-member juries are sufficientWilliams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970). and that five-member juries are not.Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223 (1978). Verdict unanimity is not required for twelve-member juries,Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972). but is required for six-member juries.Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U.S. 130 (1979). ;Vicinage The provision requiring that the jury be drawn \\"of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law\\" is known as the Vicinage Clause. The Vicinage Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes not committed within a state.Cook v. United States, 138 U.S. 157, 181 (1891) (No Man's Land of the Oklahoma Panhandle); Jones v. United States, 137 U.S. 202, 211 (1890) (Navassa Island); United States v. Dawson, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 467, 487 (1853) (Indian Territory). Nor does the Clause prevent a crime from being tried by a jury from a different division (a subset of a federal judicial district) within the same district in which the crime was committed.Lewis v. United States, 279 U.S. 63, 72‚Äì73 (1929); Ruthenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 480, 482 (1918). The Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.Caudill v. Scott, 857 F.2d 344 (6th Cir. 1988); Cook v. Morrill, 783 F.2d 593 (5th Cir. 1986); Zicarelli v. Dietz, 633 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1980). Public trial A courtroom sketch, a common component of media coverage of trials U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . public trial . . . . The defendant has a right to have the courtroom open to the public, absent a showing of a substantial government interest that cannot be addressed by alternatives other than closure. The right to a public trial extends to pre-trial matters such as a suppression hearingWaller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39 (1984). and jury selection.Presley v. Georgia, 130 S. Ct. 721 (2010) (per curiam). The Public Trial Clause has its roots in the \\"traditional Anglo-American distrust for secret trials has been variously ascribed to the notorious use of this practice by the Spanish Inquisition, to the excesses of the English Court of Star Chamber, and to the French monarchy's abuse of the lettre de cachet.\\"In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 268-69 (1948) (footnotes omitted). The Sixth Amendment public trial right is held by the defendant, and the excluded public have no ability to assert it.Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 379-91 (1979). Independently, however, the public has a substantially similar First Amendment right to attend.See, e.g., Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal. (Press Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1 (1986); Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal. (Press Enterprise I), 464 U.S. 501 (1984); Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980). Self-incrimination U.S. Const. amend. V provides: :[N]or shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . . While the Self- Incrimination Clause primarily implicates the law of criminal investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first.Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605, 607-12 (1972). But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination within the scope of the direct examination.Brown v. United States, 356 U.S. 148 (1958); Fitzpatrick v. United States, 178 U.S. 304 (1900); Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591 (1896). Similarly, the Clause \\"forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\\"Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965); see also Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406 (1966). This principle applies at the sentencing phase, even after a plea of guilty.Mitchell v. United States (1999), 526 U.S. 314 (1999). While the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction forbidding adverse inferences from his or her failure to testify, a defendant is not entitled to prevent such an instruction.Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U.S. 333 (1978). \\"Nothing in the Fifth Amendment privilege entitles a defendant as a matter of constitutional right to await the end of the State's case before announcing the nature of his defense, any more than it entitles him to await the jury's verdict on the State's case-in-chief before deciding whether or not to take the stand himself.\\"Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 85 (1970). For example, a jurisdiction may require the defendant to disclose intended alibi witnesses before trial.Williams, 399 U.S. at 82-86. Double jeopardy U.S. Const. amend. V provides: :[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . . The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment.North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711 (1969). Jeopardy \\"attaches\\" when the jury empaneled, the first witness is sworn, or a plea is accepted.Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28 (1978). The \\"dual sovereignty doctrine\\" permits the federal government and each state to proceed separately.Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82 (1985). ;Prosecution after acquittal The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141 (1962); Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54 (1978). a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564 (1977). an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court),Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1 (1978). or an \\"implied acquittal\\" via conviction of a lesser included offense.Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184 (1957). In addition, the government is barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal,Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970). even if the jury hung on other counts.Yeager v. United States, 557 U.S. 110 (2009). This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismissSerfass v. United States, 420 U.S. 377 (1973). or other non-merits dismissal,United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82 (1978). or a directed verdict after a jury conviction,Wilson v. United States, 420 U.S. 332 (1975). Nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute.Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U.S. 462 (2005). Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after a deadlocked jury,Renico v. Lett, 130 S. Ct. 1855 (2010). an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency,Ball v. United States, 163 U.S. 662 (1896). including habeas,United States v. Tateo, 377 U.S. 463 (1964). or \\"thirteenth juror\\" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiencyTibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31 (1982). on the principle that jeopardy has not \\"terminated.\\" There may also be an exception for judicial bribery,Aleman v. Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook Cnty., 138 F.3d 302 (7th Cir. 1998). but not jury bribery. ;Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977). Blockburger is the default rule, unless the legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,Garrett v. United States, 471 U.S. 773 (1985); Rutledge v. United States, 517 U.S. 292 (1996). as can conspiracy.United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378 (1992). The Blockburger test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359 (1983). In Grady v. Corbin (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied,Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990). but Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon (1993).United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688 (1993). ;Prosecution after mistrial The rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \\"bad faith,\\" i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial.Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982). If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \\"manifest necessity\\" for granting the mistrial.Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497 (1978). The same standard governs mistrials granted sua sponte. Assistance of Counsel U.S. Const. amend. VI provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes, as relevant here, at least six distinct rights: the right to counsel of choice, the right to appointed counsel, the right not to be constructively denied counsel, the right to conflict-free counsel, the effective assistance of counsel, and the right to represent oneself pro se. A defendant does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in any civil proceeding, including a deportation hearing (even though deportability is often a collateral consequence of criminal conviction).INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032 (1984); Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135 (1945). ;Choice of counsel A defendant must be given an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel.Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3 (1954). Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest,Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153 (1988). scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee),Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1 (1983). criminal defendants have a right to be represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140 (2006). In Caplin & Drysdale v. United States (1989), the Court held that there is no Sixth Amendment exception to criminal forfeiture; i.e., after conviction, the government can seek forfeiture of already paid legal fees under a forfeiture statute, notwithstanding the effect on the defendant's ability to retain counsel of choice.Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617 (1989). ;Appointment of counsel A defendant unable to retain counsel has the right to appointed counsel at the government's expense. While the Supreme Court recognized this right gradually, it currently applies in all federal and state criminal proceedings where the defendant faces authorized imprisonment greater than one year (a \\"felony\\") or where the defendant is actually imprisoned.In chronological order, Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932) (\\"special circumstances\\" in capital cases); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938) (all federal felonies); Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455 (1942) (\\"special circumstances\\" in non-capital cases); Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52 (1961) (all capital cases); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963) (all felony cases), overruling Betts, 316 U.S. 455; Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972) (all actual imprisonment); Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002) (suspended sentences). A defendant does not have a right to appointed counsel if he or she is not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year,Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979). even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime,Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738 (1994), overruling Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U.S. 222 (1980). or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment.Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973). Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal,Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988); McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, 486 U.S. 429 (1988); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259 (2000). or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal,Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987). even if facing execution.Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1 (1989). ;Constructive denial Whether counsel are appointed or retained, the Clause protects the role of counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial.See Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444 (1940). And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel,Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570 (1961). or restricting the order in which the defendant may be called as a witness.Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605, 612-13 (1972). Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant.Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80 (1976). Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853 (1975). ;Conflict-free counsel Whether counsel is retained or appointed, the defendant has a right to counsel without a conflict of interest.Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 68-77 (1942). If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal.Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776 (1987); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980); Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475 (1978). The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived,See United States v. Curcio, 680 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1982). but some conflicts are un-waiveable.See, e.g., United States v. Schwarz, 283 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Fulton, 5 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 1993). ;Ineffective assistance of counsel In Strickland v. Washington (1984), the Court held that, on collateral review, a defendant may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both (1) that defense counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness (the \\"performance prong\\") and (2) that, but for the deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different (the \\"prejudice prong\\").Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or she would not have plead guilty.Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985). In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland, a defendant who rejects the prosecution's plea offer must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by the prosecution, and accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012) (acceptance of less favorable plea offer after rejected plea offer); Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376 (2012) (conviction at trial after rejected plea offer). See also Casey Scott McKay, Constitutional Law-the Plea-Bargaining Process-Mr. Counsel, Please Bargain Effectively for Your Client's Sixth Amendment Rights, Otherwise the Trial Court Will Be Forced to Reoffer the Plea Deal and Then Exercise Discretion in Resentencing, 82 Miss. L.J. 731 (2013). ;Pro se representation In Faretta v. California (1975), the Court held that a criminal defendant has the right to knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se representation at trial.Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975). This right is not per se violated by the appointment of standby counsel.McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984). There is no constitutional right to self- representation on appeal.Martinez v. California Court of Appeals, 528 U.S. 152 (2000). Clauses of general applicability All of the foregoing constitutional provisions apply exclusively to criminal matters. In contrast, the due process and equal protection clauses have substantial application outside of the criminal law. Due process U.S. Const. amend. V provides: :[N]or shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . . U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ¬ß 1 provides: :[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . . The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply generally to all stages of criminal proceedings. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation of all of the foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.See, e.g., Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985) (psychiatric expert witness fees for indigent defendants); Burns v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 252 (1959) (filing fee for a notice of appeal for indigent defendants); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956) (transcript fee for indigent defendants); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927) (conflict of interest of trier of fact); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86 (1923) (Holmes, J.) (mob dominated trials); see also Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 345 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting). ;Proof beyond a reasonable doubt The due process clauses require that the burden of proof in criminal cases be placed on the government, and that the quantum of proof be beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship (1970) explicitly held that \\"the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\\"In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970); see also Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684 (1975). But, the state may place the burden of proof for an affirmative defense on the defendant.Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977) (extreme emotional disturbance); Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790 (1952) (insanity). Erroneous denial of a reasonable doubt instruction is a structural error that entitles the defendant to automatic reversal.Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993); Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100 (1972) (per curiam). Erroneous definitions of reasonable doubt do not require reversal as long as \\"taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\\"Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 22 (1994) (quoting Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140 (1954)). Instructions on certain evidentiary presumptions against the defendant, if interpreted as conclusive presumptions or as shifting the burden of proof to the defendant, are also unconstitutional;Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979); Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 29-54 (1959). permissive presumptions are constitutional.County Court of Ulster Cty. v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140 (1979). In some circumstances, a trial court must separately instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence, in addition to giving a reasonable doubt instruction.Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U.S. 478 (1978). The reasonable doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions, but it retains its relevance when the trial judge considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence. On federal habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, to grant relief, the reviewing court must find that \\"upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\\"Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 324 (1979). In a successive, abusive, or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction, a defendant claiming \\"actual innocence\\" must show that \\"it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\\"Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995) (citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478 (1986)). ;Brady disclosure Brady v. Maryland (1963) is another significant, specific criminal procedural right guaranteed by the due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachmentGiglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972).) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, and there is a reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different (\\"materiality\\").Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995). Whether the government acted in \\"good faith\\" or \\"bad faith\\" is irrelevant to Brady. But, if the defendant cannot prove that withheld evidence would have been exculpatory, because its import is unknown, to obtain relief, the defendant must instead show that the government acted in bad faith.Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988); Illinois v. Fisher, 540 U.S. 544 (2004) (per curiam). The government is not required to disclose impeachment material prior to plea bargaining.United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622 (2002). Whether the government must disclose exculpatory material during plea bargaining is an open question. ;Mental competence \\"It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial\\" consistent with the Due Process Clause.Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 171 (1975); see also Bishop v. United States, 350 U.S. 961 (1956) (per curiam). The \\"test\\" is \\"whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding‚Äîand whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\\"Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960) (per curiam). A state may place the burden on the defendant has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence,Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437 (1992). but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence.Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348 (1996). The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary.Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375 (1966). The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); see also Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992). A defendant who is competent to stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights,Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389 (1993). but not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial in the face of a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008). ;Prosecutorial misconduct Due process prohibits the prosecution from knowingly using falsehood to convict the defendant, and requires reversal if there is a reasonable likelihood that the verdict was affected--whether the falsehood is inculpatoryAlcorta v. Texas, 355 U.S. 28 (1957) (per curiam); Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1 (1956); New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, 318 U.S. 688 (1943) (per curiam); Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213 (1942); Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103 (1935) (per curiam); but see White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760 (1945) (per curiam); Hysler v. Florida, 315 U.S. 411 (1942). or goes the credibility of a witness.Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959). Equal protection U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ¬ß 1 provides: :[N]or shall any State . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The equal protection clauses has at least three applications relevant to criminal proceedings: a prohibition on selective prosecution on invidious bases, a requirement that jury pools and venires represent a \\"fair cross section\\" of the community, and a prohibition on the discriminatory use of jury peremptory challenges. ;Selective prosecution The defendant may move to dismiss a criminal charge on the ground that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races.United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996). The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987). ;Discrimination in the jury pool and venire A nineteenth-century painting of a jury composed exclusively of white men The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the exclusion of persons from selection for a grand or petit jury on the basis of race,Coleman v. Alabama, 389 U.S. 22 (1967); Eubanks v. Louisiana, 356 U.S. 584 (1958); Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954); Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559 (1953); Cassell v. Texas, 339 U.S. 282 (1950); Patton v. Mississippi, 332 U.S. 463 (1947); Hill v. Texas, 316 U.S. 400 (1942); Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128 (1940); Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U.S. 354 (1939); Hale v. Kentucky, 303 U.S. 613 (1938) (per curiam); Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587 (1935); Rogers v. Alabama, 192 U.S. 226 (1904); Carter v. Texas, 177 U.S. 442 (1900); Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370 (1881); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880); but see Franklin v. South Carolina, 218 U.S. 161, 165-68 (1910); Brownfield v. South Carolina, 189 U.S. 426 (1903); Tarrance v. Florida, 188 U.S. 519 (1903); Smith v. Mississippi, 162 U.S. 592 (1896); Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565 (1896). For non-criminal cases concerning segregated juries, see Carter v. Jury Comm'n of Greene Cnty., 396 U.S. 320 (1970); Bush v. Kentucky, 107 U.S. 110 (1883); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1879); Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313 (1879). regardless of the race of the defendant.Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493 (1973). Further, the defendant is entitled to a jury pool that represents a \\"fair cross section\\" of the community. In order to prove a \\"fair cross section\\" violation, the defendant must show that (1) a \\"distinctive\\" (i.e., cognizable) group (2) is not represented fairly and reasonably in the jury pool in proportion to the community (3) due to systematic exclusion.Berghuis v. Smith, 130 S. Ct. 1382 (2010); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975) (opt-in for women unconstitutional); Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979); Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187 (1946) (exclusion of women unconstitutional); Thiel v. S. Pac. Co., 328 U.S. 217 (1946) (exclusion of daily wage earners unconstitutional); see also Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 83-87 (1942) (stating, in dicta, that requirement that women attend jury classes to serve would be unconstitutional). ;Discriminatory peremptory challenges While a defendant is entitled to a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury.Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313 (1880). Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges in the selection of the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). There are three steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party opposing the use of a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance.Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005). Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge.See, e.g., Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991). Third, the trial court must decide whether the explanation is pretextual.See, e.g., Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995) (per curiam). A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.Miller-El v. Dretke (Miller-El II), 545 U.S. 231 (2005); Snyder v. Louisiana, 128 S. Ct. 1203 (2008). If the trial judge erroneously permits the striking of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If the trial judge erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis.Rivera v. Illinois, 129 S. Ct. 1446 (2009). The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim.Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991). Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes (\\"reverse Batson\\").Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127 (1994).

He created the label in order to share music that he felt was too personal to release through any other label. Clown & Sunset‚Äôs first two records were a series of EPs entitled Sunset of a Clown, released in February and October, 2009 respectively. Each EP contained a song from one of the three founding artists. Clown & Sunset‚Äôs next EP, Russian Dolls, featured the song ‚ÄúRussian Dolls‚Äù by Jaar, and a remix from Detroit DJ and producer Ryan Crosson. In December 2010, Clown & Sunset released In√©s, a ten-track compilation. The LP was well received by fans and critics, receiving 7.7 out of 10 rating from Pitchfork. Following In√©s, Clown & Sunset began to expand its original roster. As Nikita and Soul searched for musicians to incorporate into the label, Jaar continued the momentum of 2010 releasing his debut album Space is Only Noise to critical acclaim,http://www.residentadvisor.net/review- view.aspx?id=8660 receiving \\"Best New Music\\" from Pitchfork.

Otherwise, the power to impose such delays would effectively allow prosecutors to send anyone to jail for an arbitrary length of time without trial. Although it is important for the protection of speedy trial rights for there to be a court in which a defendant may complain about the unreasonable delay of the trial, it is also important that nations implement structures that avoid the delay. Recognition of speedy trial rights In jurisdictions with strong rule of law, the requirement of a \\"speedy trial\\" forces prosecutors to diligently build cases within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity and heinousness of the crimes of which suspects are accused. The right is based on the notion that long-term incarceration should normally be restricted to situations in which a judge or jury have determined a suspect has committed a crime. The right to a speedy trial is codified in fundamental legal documents in several jurisdictions, and may be further defined by statutory law. Canada Speedy trial rights are recognized within Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Europe Within Europe, speedy trial rights are recognized by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In English law, this right was developed by the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 (a judge would be summoned if one was not immediately available) and Magna Carta in 1215 (\\"To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.\\").  Japan  The of the Japanese Constitution states, \\"In all criminal cases the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal.\\" , which had not held a court for 15 years, was dismissed by Supreme Court of Japan according to Article 37. After the Takada case, it is considered that dismissing judge should only apply if the accused ask acceleration of a trial. Philippines The Constitution of the Philippines states, \\"All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.\\" United States In the United States, basic speedy trial rights are protected by the Speedy Trial Clause of the United States Constitution. States may also offer additional speedy trial protections. In June 1776, a \\"speedy trial\\" provision was explicitly included in the Virginia Declaration of Rights by George Mason, its principal author. The consequences of a speedy trial violation may require that the case be dismissed, although depending upon the circumstances it may be possible for the state to again initiate a criminal charge against a defendant despite a speedy trial violation.

It is played on a 10x10 checkered board with three types of animal playing-pieces that move like the queen, bishop and rook in chess. Two distinguishing features from a typical chess variant are the absence of capture, and the fundamental role of a rock-paper-scissors dominance relationship among the three types of pieces: elephant, lion and mouse. Each player controls six animals comprising two of each animal type. The object of the game is to occupy three of the four ‚Äúwatering hole‚Äù squares that are located near the center of the board. A player's animals are friendly to each other, meaning they are allowed to occupy squares adjacent to each other. For opposing sides, however, the mouse fears the lion, the lion fears the elephant, and the elephant fears the mouse; an animal cannot move to a square, nor permanently abide in a square, that is adjacent to an animal it fears (with the exception of a \\"trapped\\" animal, as described in Movement Restrictions below). Achieving the win-condition requires coordinating one's animals in support of each other to hold two of the watering holes, against the opponent's attempts to repel, while creating an opening to occupy a third watering hole. Rules The rules of Barca are codified in the instruction manual of the retail version of the game, and also described in a video interview of Caldwell by LivingDice.com. Additional clarifications are provided by Caldwell in a Q&A; web page. Setup Players face each other with the board between them. The animals are separated into light and dark sets with twelve animals per set and two of each animal type in a set. The animals are arranged as shown in the diagram with the two elephants side by side in the center of the back row, the two mice in front of the two elephants, and the two lions separated on each side of the mice. Initial positions Movement Players agree between themselves who shall move first, optionally playing rock-paper-scissors to resolve the question. Players then alternate turns moving one of their animals per turn. The mouse moves along rows and columns (i.e. horizontally and vertically). The lion moves on diagonals. The elephant moves along rows, columns and diagonals. An animal can move any number of squares on the board in a single direction per turn, but may not jump over other animals. { Moves of the mouse Moves of the lion Moves of the elephant } Movement Restrictions The rock- paper-scissors dominance-rules prevent animals moving to certain squares that would otherwise be accessible by the general movement rules described above. A player's animals may occupy squares next to each other, but, for opposing sides, the mouse fears the lion, the lion fears the elephant, and the elephant fears the mouse. An animal may not move to a square adjacent to an animal that it fears (with one exception noted below for a ‚Äútrapped‚Äù animal). Moves available to \\"afraid\\" elephant. The red \\"not\\" symbols mark locations normally available except that the elephant would be afraid due to the adjacent opposing player's mouse. Squares adjacent to an animal include all those within one square of the animal, horizontally, vertically and diagonally. An animal is said to be ‚Äúafraid‚Äù when it is adjacent to an animal it fears. For example, if a player moves a lion adjacent to the opposing player's mouse, then that mouse becomes afraid. On a player's turn, if any of the player's animals are afraid, then one of them must be moved to a square where it is not afraid, if possible. An animal is said to be ‚Äútrapped‚Äù if it is afraid and its only available moves still leave it afraid. On a player's turn, if the player has one or more animals that are afraid, but all such animals are also trapped, then the player may optionally move a trapped animal to a square where it remains afraid. This is the only case in which an animal may move to a square in which it will be afraid. Winning The four marked squares near the center of the board are the watering holes. The first player to get three of their animals on the watering holes at the same time wins the game. A player may win even if one or more of their animals remains afraid or trapped after the winning move. Popular culture Barca appears in the fantasy fiction book Mortals & Deities - Book Two of the Genesis of Oblivion Saga by Maxwell Alexander Drake. In Drake's fantasy world it is described as an ancient game with the same name and rules as Barca, but with animal pieces from that world: Krugours, Niyoka and Drakons for mouse, lion and elephant (respectively). Trivia Barca is named after the Carthaginian military commander Hannibal Barca who attacked ancient Rome with an army that included war elephants.

The town was founded in 1928 after the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Company laid tracks through the area. The rail spur that passes through Barwise extended from the Fort Worth and Denver Railway junction at Estelline to Lubbock and Plainview. According to the Handbook of Texas, the town of Barwise was originally named after J. W. Stringer, a local farmer and the owner of the original town site.Charles G. Davis, \\"Barwise, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hnb11, accessed December 26, 2011, Published by the Texas State Historical Association. When it was discovered that another Texas town was already named Stringer, the name had to be changed. Some residents wanted to name the town ‚ÄúGranary,‚Äù but the final designation became Barwise, named after Judge Joseph Hodson Barwise of Wichita Falls. As the story goes, Judge Barwise, who served as the Assistant General Attorney for the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway Company from 1902‚Äì1906 and later became a member of the board of directors, was the first person off the train to register at the local hotel.Johnson, F.W. 1914. A history of Texas and Texans, Volume 3. Chicago: The American Historical Society, p. 1313. Barwise was never very large. Originally the town covered several city blocks and by the 1930s it had a hotel, a general store, a fertilizer dealer, a fueling station, a cotton gin, and two grain elevators. By the 1940s, the population was only 25 and the 1986‚Äì87 Texas Almanac listed a population of only 30. The 1990 population was still reported as 30, but in 2000 it dropped to 16. With improvements in state highways and the paving of many of the farm to market roads across West Texas, railroads became less important for shipping agricultural products and for general passenger travel. Farm to Market Road 784 reached Barwise in the late 1950s providing additional transportation opportunities. BNSF Railway, which last owned and operated the former Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway, abandoned the tracks in 1989.William C. Billingsley, \\"Fort Worth and Denver Railway,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqf03, accessed December 26, 2011, Published by the Texas State Historical Association.

Life Vincent Glinsky was born in Russia on December 18, 1895 and emigrated to America just before World War I, settling in Syracuse, NY, with his family. In 1916 he moved to New York City, joining the inaugural class of the Beaux Arts Institute of Design, where he later taught (1931‚Äì32; 1940‚Äì41). During 1925‚Äì26 Glinsky studied at Columbia University's School of Architecture and moved into the field of architectural sculpture, working with Albert Kahn (\\"the architect of Detroit\\"), on the Maccabees Building, among other projects. Glinsky designed the entranceway reliefs, bronze elevator doors, and letterbox for New York's Fred F. French Building (constructed 1927; added to the National Register of Historic Places, 2004). In 1927 Glinsky went to live in Europe for approximately two years, settling first in Rome. He later moved to Paris, where he was acknowledged as part of L'Ecole de Paris, a group of artists which included sculptors such as Calder, Giacometti, and Lifschitz, and painters such as Picasso, Dufy, and Roualt. In Paris Glinsky had a one-man show at the Galerie Zak in February 1929, followed by two group shows in Paris, one at Galerie Zak in 1929, and the other at Le Salon des Tuileries in 1930. In 1932 he was part of the Parisian show, \\"Artistes Americains de Paris,\\" at the Galerie de la Renaissance. On his return to New York, Glinsky began to exhibit widely. A solo show at The Fifty-Sixth St. Galleries was followed by showings in group exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Museum, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Architectural League, Art Institute of Chicago, National Gallery of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among other venues. In 1935 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the following year the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts awarded him the Widener Gold Medal for his work, The Awakening. As a Federal Art Project artist, Glinsky exhibited and presented live sculpture demonstrations at New York's 1939 World's Fair, and won competitive commissions from the Treasury Relief Art Project and the Section of Painting and Sculpture, to create bas- reliefs for United States Post Offices in Hudson, NY, Weirton, WV, and Union City, PA.http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_32808_2805_432816_43/http%3B/pubcontent.state.pa.us/publishedcontent/publish/cop_environment/phmc/communities/extranet/preservationprograms/75thnewdeal/postofficemuralsucontent/pomurals.pdf In 1937 Glinsky joined with 56 other artists as a Founding Member of the Sculptors Guild in New York. The Sculptors Guild was conceived as an advocacy and exhibiting organization devoted to furthering the sculptural arts. Its 1938 inaugural show included works by Glinsky, Paul Manship, Chaim Gross, Jose de Creeft, Oronzio Maldarelli, William Zorach, and 40 other artists. Glinsky served as Executive Secretary of the Sculptors Guild between 1955‚Äì60, and stayed active in the organization until his death. Over the years he took on active roles in other arts organizations, including Vice-President of the Architectural League of New York (1956‚Äì58), Fellow of the National Sculpture Society, Academician of the National Academy of Design, and a member of the Audubon Artists' Society. During World War II Glinsky served as a draftsman at the Brooklyn Navy Yard (1943‚Äì46). He won an Arts and Letters Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1945, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts awarded him the 1948 Herbert M. Howe Memorial Prize. In 1949 he was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. At the same time Glinsky also began a career in teaching, joining the faculty of Brooklyn College (1949‚Äì55), Columbia University (1957‚Äì62), and New York University (1950‚Äì75). Later commissions included a series of panels for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, (which were posthumously enlarged for display in the lobby of N.I.H.); a bust of aviation pioneer Wilbur Wright for the N.Y.U. Hall of Fame for Great Americans; a bronze head of Eleanor Roosevelt, which became part of the collection at the U.S. Department of Labor; \\"The Waters of Life\\" sculpture for All Faiths' Memorial Tower; and an over-life-size piece for St.Paul's College in Washington D.C. His last commission, from the Tupperware Company, was a giant seal in carrara marble. In 1969 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1970. Following the artist's death on March 19, 1975, his students initiated the Vincent Glinsky Memorial Lecture, an annual event at NYU. The series ran for 12 years beginning in 1982, and featured noted art historians, critics, and artists. The inaugural lecture was given by Kirk Varnedoe, Curator of the Museum of Modern Art. Other speakers in the series included Hilton Kramer, Richard McDermott Miller, Joseph Veach Noble, Lewis Sharp, Richard Brilliant, Barbara Lekberg, Judd Tully, Marcel Jovine, Greg Wyatt, and Louis Trakis. Glinsky's colleagues also moved to honor his memory: The Sculptors Guild dedicated the 1976 Lever House exhibit to his memory, and the Audubon Artists named a yearly award in his honor. Vincent Glinsky‚Äôs papers are held at Syracuse Universityv.htm and the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art. He was married to the American sculptor Cleo Hartwig (1907‚Äì1988). His son is composer and author Albert Glinsky.

Eventually the singing took over, but he continued with his architectural activities when time allowed.Arbetarbladet September 6, 2009. During the 1910s and 1920s Fonandern toured frequently and performed in Sweden's folk parks. In 1921 he embarked on an American tour, which took him from coast to coast by automobile, something never done by a Swedish artist before. In Duluth, Minnesota Fonandern gave his first ever radio performance. Gustav Fonandern stayed in the United States off and on from 1921 through 1926. When he was not on tour or in the recording studio, he worked as an architect in Chicago and other cities. In addition to buildings in California and Florida, he designed 150 houses and a large hotel on Long Island, outside of New York. After returning to Sweden Fonandern continued to tour, this time by car, which was so unusual at the time that advertising posters read: \\"Performance by GUSTAV FONANDERN, architect and ballad singer with his own car!\\". Despite his great success as an entertainer, Fonandern never put away the drafting pen for good. In the early 1930s he founded yet another architectural firm, this time on Drottninggatan in Stockholm. Legacy Gustav Fonandern recorded more than two hundred fifty songs in Sweden and over forty in the United States.

The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research had one recording by Fonandern and two by Hedberg on its album \\"From Sweden To America\\", which was released as an LP in 1981 and as a CD in 1996.

(1920). The history of Cuba, Volume 3. B. F. Buck and Company.pp. 323. Life Born in Maracaibo, Venezuela from a wealthy family, his parents were Leonardo del Monte y Medrano, an assistant and Lieutenant for the Governor in that city native of Santo Domingo, and Rosa Aponte y S√°nchez, the daughter and heir of a known and influential planter. Del Monte attended preschool while living in Venezuela, before his parents moved to Dominican Republic, and thereafter to Cuba in 1810. A few years later, when Del Monte was a twelve-year-old, his parents enrolled him into the Seminary of San Carlos, a catholic alma mater of Leonardo Gamboa in the city of Havana.Cluster, Dick; Hern√°ndez, Rafael. (2008). The History of Havana. Macmillan. pp.77 He completed studies at the University of Havana and right after graduation, around the 1820s, he had a notable influence as an associate for a prominent lawyer in Havana, who shortly after, financed a trip throughout Europe and the United States for the young Del Monte.Calca√±o, Julio. (1892) Parnaso Venezolano: colecci√≥n de poes√≠as de autores venezolanos, Volume 1. Tip. de \\"El cojo\\".pp. 47 In April 1834, Del Monte married Rosa Aldama, the daughter of a wealthy planter named Miguel de Aldama. He proposed marriage to her on the Philharmonic Society salon. Rosa's father was Domingo de Aldama y Arechaga, ranked as the twelfth richest in an 1836 survey of the most wealthiest Cubans. Career On his return to Cuba, Del Monte was the founder for several literary magazines. He also joined prestigious congregations like the Economic Society of the Country's Friends, an intellectual inner circle for the wealthy elite and one in which members, planters themselves were also the publishers for the first significant newspaper in Cuba, El papel peri√≥dico de La Habana. With a vast education that had been successfully completed at the University of Havana, he began mentoring and promoting young Cuban writers. As a patron of letters, Del Monte helped and supported most of the writers during that period. He promoted literature tirelessly by donating books to institutions and loaning books to friends. He established a public library in Matanzas in 1835. As an advocate for the promulgation of Cuban culture, he organized meetings which would be held at his house, and where important figures, like Jos√© Jacinto Milan√©s, Anselmo Su√°rez y Romero, and Cirilo Villaverde would later attend, to discuss topics like literature, and other issues related to social reform, and the autonomy of the country.Echevarr√≠a Gonz√°lez, Roberto. (2010).Cuban Fiestas. Yale University Press. . p. 82 The period between 1830-1840 has been considered as the Golden Age of literature in Cuba. No other intellectual of the period was as influential as Del Monte. He was in the middle of the flourishing of the Romanticism movement throughout Cuba, which included the best exponents of the epoch. He auspices, among other writers, Juan Francisco Manzano, whom he meets in 1830. Still a slave, and whose freedom was attainable only later, in July 23, 1836 through the funds that were raised by Del Monte's group. Manzano's talent as an outspoken author was impressive. Del Monte helped him and promoted all his works, after considering him as one of the best writers in Cuba. In 1831 Del Monte published Manzano's first poem Al nacimiento de la Infanta Mar√≠a Isabel de Luisa de Borb√≥n \\"On the birth of the Infanta Mar√≠a Isabel de Luisa de Borb√≥n\\" in the literary magazine La Moda, followed by other poems in Diario de la Habana, and also in other periodicals like El Aguinaldo Habanero and El album. Del Monte accomplished the publication of Manzano's masterpiece. In 1839 the manuscript Autobiography of a slave (1839) () was published in England, through a British official by the name of Richard Robert Madden, an abolitionist, who after corresponding through letters with Del Monte, showed an interest to include Manzano's work in an antislavery tract soon to be published.Arnold, Albert James. (1994) A history of literature in the Caribbean: Hispanic and francophone regions. John Benjamins Publishing Company.p. 144 During his career, Del Monte wrote some poetry, but most of his works were written in a prose style that differed from most of the popular writers of the epoch. He was known though, as the founding voice for pamphlet writing and short circulations, especially those that consisted and were based on political discourse arguments, in which his authorial presence had an influential impact. In 1836 for example, he wrote a critique titled La Isla de Cuba tal cual est√°, against the administration of Miguel Tac√≥n. The critique was a refute to a pamphlet written by Guerra Bethancourt, (former professor of Milan√©s), who had praised the government. The response by Del Monte paved the way for other political tracts to denounce the decisions taken by the government.Coester, Alfred. (1916).The literary history of Spanish America. The Macmillan company. pp. 381. In 1837, Jos√© Antonio Saco, another writer, wrote a tract about the English colonies and the republic of Cuba. His main argument consisted of the advantages of Cuba with Britain or the United States. Although Del Monte's group consisted of writers mainly from the Romanticism movement, the narratives they employed in their writings, even though constructed from a fictional perspective, they were seen as a threat and an instigation to the colonial government. Most of the non- fictional works, like Manzano's autobiography could only be published overseas years later, through the abolitionist Richard Robert Madden in England. Del Monte nonetheless would always encourage them to write from a Realism's stance, so as a result slavery could be depicted accurately, and that way advocacy for the antislavery movement could advance under the colonial regime. Del Monte and other contemporary writers like F√©lix Varela, Jos√© Antonio Saco, and Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero, identified themselves as autonomous nationalists. Most of them envisioned a Cuba without black or mixed Cuban races. In that sense they all had patriarchal beliefs. For them being Cuban implied being a Catholic, as well as an exclusive descendant from white Spaniards, since the rest of the peoples, those of mixed and black races were just uncultured.Pancrazio, James J. (2010) The logic of fetishism: Alejo Carpentier and the Cuban tradition. For Del Monte though, the solution for economic advancement lied in suppressing slavery, by either repatriating African blacks or by gradually ceasing the black slave trade that was in effect at the time. On October 17, 1848, he wrote a letter stating his opinions where he said: > ‚Ä¶ that the purpose of every Cuban should be in terminate the slave trade, > and then, insensibly, the slavery, without upheaval or violence; and > finally,‚Ä¶ cleanse Cuba of the African race.Revista cubana: peri√≥dico de > ciencias, filosof√≠a, literatura, y bellas artes, volume 11. Cartas de > Domingo del Monte. (1899). Retrieved on December 1, 2011.Alonso, Carlos J. > (1998) The burden of modernity: the rhetoric of cultural discourse in > Spanish America. Oxford University Press pp. 72 For Del Monte, the development of Cuba as an autonomous country had to come from within, but only through the direct involvement of white Cubans in the affairs of the country. That is, Del Monte was neither in favor of yielding Cuba's autonomy under Spanish rule, nor in favor of annexation under the United States. In both cases, in his opinion, the black race would become the majority group, and as a result, would run the country either under Spanish or Anglo-American authority. In Del Monte's view, white Cubans' involvement in governmental affairs was tantamount to the autonomy of Cuba. On October 18, 1848, he wrote a letter from Spain, wherein he clearly stated that: > I am not for the annexation to the United States. To do so, Cuba must become > a war field: on one side the combatants would be criollos and Anglo- > americans, on the other, Spaniards and Englishmen, and in the background, > lingering, the Blacks. Result: the Spaniards lose their colony, and the > Cubans lose their land. Cuba then would be declared an independent black > republic, under the protectorate of England and the United States. > Yo no estoy por el plan de agregaci√≥n a los Estados Unidos. Para realizarlo, > ser√≠a preciso hacer a Cuba campo de batalla: los combatientes ser√≠an por un > lado criollos y anglo-americanos, por otro espa√±oles √© ingleses. Al fondo, > en expectativa, negros. Resultado: los espa√±oles se quedan sin su Colonia: > los Cubanos sin su tierra: Cuba ser√≠a declarado rep√∫blica negra > independiente, bajo el protectorado de Inglaterra y los Estados Unidose. In 1838, even though Del Monte ideals about black slave trade was that of an abolitionist, as a planter and slave owner, his beliefs were still pro- slavery. He seemed to admire both governments of the United States and England. He was quoted as saying that: > It is an irrefutable fact that the United States of America has, since its > founding, enjoyed the greatest political liberty, and they still have > slaves. Most of the sources have agreed upon the conclusion that Del Monte was in favor of abolition, and against and annexation by either Spain or the United States, as stated in his own letters. See for example Cartas de Domingo del Monte. Also around the same year, Del Monte looked forward to establish an anti-annexationist newspaper. See for example Mart√≠nez-Fern√°ndez, p. 17It is not so clear, however, his annexationist thoughts with regards to Great Britain, since in a letter written in March 1845 he praised the advancements by that country and did not discard the possibility of annexation. In the same year however, while Del Monte lived in Spain and with the help of some of the friends from Cuba, he looked forward to establish an anti-annexationist newspaper that should be: > monarchichal-religious-constitutional; moderate, but bordering on > absolutism. In that sense Del Monte's beliefs leaned more toward an assimilationist Europhile than an annexationist. In 1838, Jos√© Zacar√≠as Gonz√°lez del Valle, a philosopher, professor, and a member of the literary salon group () which Del Monte founded, and also a close friend of Del Monte who would correspond later with him during the years when Del Monte lived in Spain, said that the group, of which he also was part of: \\"consisted of young men imbued with the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, who exchanged books and ideas in a clandestine manner, and who dedicated their noble and generous hearts to end the slave trade and slavery.\\" Gonz√°lez del Valle, Jos√© Zacar√≠as. La vida literaria en Cuba. Letter from Jos√© Zacar√≠as Gonz√°lez del Valle to Anselmo Su√°rez y Romero (1836-1840). Conspiracy of La Escalera Del Monte was in the center of the conspiracy of La Escalera (1844) . He was accused, along with Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero, and F√©lix Tanco, of conspiring with black slaves to revolt against the colonial government. The conspiracy was an uprising among black slaves to denounce the injustices by the government, and against the sanctions imposed upon them by the colonial authorities. Many of the slaves were savagely tortured, while others, like \\"Pl√°cido\\", were killed. 1844 was known as the Year of the Lash, or \\"Year of the whip\\". . The conspiracy acquired its name from a wooden ladder where slaves would be strapped into, and henceforth punished by whipping. Although there is speculation whether the revolt was indeed a conspiracy or just an excuse from the government to inflict despotism onto the black population, it is a fact that the rebellion, which started in 1843, erupted in C√°rdenas in March of that year, and in Matanzas, in November, throughout sugar mills () in both municipalities.The number of sources that discuss the Escalera Conspiracy is limited. The facts remain unclear. Most of the works reference the book by Robert L. Paquette Sugar is made with blood: The Conspiracy of La Escalera and the conflict between empires over slavery in Cuba. Published in 1990 by Wesleyan Press.In recent years, others have said that the consensus of non- conspiracy no longer exists. And that conspiratorial activities, although not uncovered in the plot as it was originally claimed by colonial authorities, did occur. The suggested sources to consult are nonetheless by Robert L. Paquette. According to some sources, in December 1843, a white planter in Matanzas, discovered the plot that aimed to overthrow the Spanish government. The serving captain-general Leopoldo O'Donnell was informed in January 1844 about the impending conspiracy that involved not only slaves, but also free people of color, foreigners, and white criollos. He [O'Donnell] ordered extensive interrogation which led to torture by tying those who were believed to be suspects until they would confess. The procedures were conducted not only in Matanzas, but across the country. In that year, Del Monte was forced into exile to avoid being arrested. Others, like the writer F√©lix Tanco, were imprisoned. As a white criollo, Domingo del Monte undoubtedly was the most influential intellectual in Cuba at the time. In 1840 he met Alexander Everett in Havana. Everett headed an investigation brought against Nicholas Trist, then U.S. consul in Havana, for being part of the transatlantic slave trade.Rugemer, Edward Barlett. (2007)The problem of emancipation: the Caribbean roots of the American Civil War. p. 211 They corresponded with each other thereafter, and in 1842 Del Monte wrote a letter to Everett, warning him of a conspiracy by slaves to undertake control of the country and possibly to end slavery, with the supposed backing of British abolitionists, and especially of David Turnbull, British consul in Havana from 1841‚Äì1843, who at the time was living in Jamaica, a safe haven from Spanish forces in Cuba. His assistant, Francis Ross Cocking, was supposedly implicated in the conspiracy, although he was never accused of any wrongdoing.Johnson, Walter; Lehrman, Gilder. (2001). The chattel principle: internal slave trades in the Americas. Yale University Press.p. 287 In 1843, Everett forwarded a copy of the letter that Del Monte wrote, to Robert Campbell, U.S. consul in Havana, and to Washington Irving, the U.S. minister in Spain. Irving replied that the Spanish authorities were not concerned, since the forces counted with the capabilities and henceforth were fully prepared to face any uprising. Webster also passed on the information to John Calhoun, who assured him that President John Tyler had been informed on the matter.

A series of six episodes began on 26 December 2011, concluding on 30 January 2012. The first episode picked up more than 8 million viewers but the series soon declined in ratings. The series was heavily criticised by viewers and critics. At 71 Jason was widely felt to be too old for the lead role. Background The series was written by Mark Bussell and Justin Sbresni following the success of their BBC sitcom The Worst Week of My Life. The pair came up with the idea of a Johnny English-type character who had to defend the royal family, but ended up doing so in a comic fashion. The pair immediately decided to make the programme family-orientated: at this stage, they did not envision Jason as the lead character. BBC comedy commissioner Cheryl Taylor lured Jason to the role, after initially offering him the job of executive producer. The series became the first for several years in which Jason had performed his own stunts. Filming on the series began in June 2011, and concluded in November. The first episode of the series was broadcast on 26 December 2011.Writers, Producer and Star Interview - The Royal Bodyguard - British Comedy Guide Critical reception Just hours after its broadcast, the first episode was heavily criticised by fans of Jason and viewers alike. Jim Shelley wrote \\"The Royal Bodyguard was, the BBC trumpeted, Sir David Jason‚Äôs first Beeb comedy since Only Fools & Horses finished in 2002 - that was nine years ago. This fact alone should have alerted all involved to the fatal flaw at the heart of this debacle ‚Äì namely that it was relying on the viewer‚Äôs fondness for Del Boy. It was a classic example of blind faith in the production‚Äôs star name. The prospect of seeing the 71-year-old star playing a former guardsman who had seen action in Northern Ireland and had now been appointed to the presumably prestigious position of royal bodyguard after saving the Queen‚Äôs life stretched this fondness to breaking point. After about two minutes. Never mind that the plot‚Äôs entire premise was stupid ‚Äì that he was the incompetent former head of security at Buckingham Palace car park. The standard of the comedy was excruciating. It was blatantly designed to cash in on the appeal of characters like Inspector Clouseau and Johnny English. But the idea that Jason could play a clown as well as Peter Sellers or Rowan Atkinson was the only funny thing about it.\\"David Jason's The Royal Bodyguard slammed by fans - Mirror Online Characters * David Jason as Captain Guy Hubble - an ex-guardsman who has seen action in Cyprus and Northern Ireland, before becoming Head of Security at Buckingham Palace car park. He is appointed as Royal Bodyguard after saving the Queen's life in an apparent act of bravery on the day of the State Opening of Parliament. * Geoffrey Whitehead as Colonel Dennis Whittington - Whittington is Hubble's boss. The Colonel quickly realises that Hubble is a weak link in the security service, but is unable to fire him because Hubble somehow manages to keep pleasing the Queen and appease Sir Edward Hastings. * Timothy Bentinck as Sir Edward Hastings - the top man in royal security. Colonel Whittington keeps approaching his boss with reports that Hubble is endangering royal security repeatedly and on a colossal scale, yet somehow Hubble comes out the other side of each disaster smelling of roses, meaning Sir Edward is unable to take any action. * Tim Downie as Yates - young, efficient and dedicated Yates has been loyally serving in the Royal Household division for a number of years. He hoped to be promoted to the position of The Royal Bodyguard, but was pipped to the position by Hubble.

In 2011 he won the Japanese Triple Crown and was voted Japanese Horse of the Year. In 2012 he added victories in the Takarazuka Kinen and the Prix Foy but was narrowly beaten in both the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Japan Cup. He acquired the reputation of being an extremely talented but temperamental racehorse. In 2013 Orfevre again won the Prix Foy and finished second in the Arc before ending his career with an eight length win in the Arima Kinen. Background Orfevre (French for \\"goldsmith\\") is a chestnut horse with a white blaze, bred by the Shadai Farm in Hokkaido, Japan. His sire Stay Gold, a son of the thirteen time Leading sire in Japan Sunday Silence, was a successful international performer, winning the Dubai Sheema Classic and the Hong Kong Vase. Standing at stud at the Big Red Farm in Hokkaido, he has produced numerous important winners including Dream Journey, Nakayama Festa and Gold Ship. His dam Oriental Art was a daughter of the Hall of Fame inductee Mejiro McQueen was also the dam of Dream Journey. The horse was ridden in Japan by Kenichi Ikezoe while Christophe Soumillon rode the horse in his European races. Racing career 2010: two-year-old season Orfevre raced three times as a two-year-old in 2010, winning his first start a 'Newcomer' race (unraced maidens), second in an open class race and 10th in the Group Two Keio Hai Nisai. 2011: three-year-old season Orfevre after winning the 78th Tokyo Yushun Orfevre was beaten in his first two races in 2011 but won his next six races. In March he won the Spring Stakes at Hanshin Racecourse. A month later he won the Satsuki Sho (Japanese 2000 Guineas), beating the odds-on favourite Sadamu Patek by three lengths. The race had been delayed for a week and moved from Nakayama to Tokyo as a result of the March 11 earthquake. On 29 May, Orfevre took the second leg of the Japanese Triple Crown when he came from well off the pace to beat Win Variation in the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby). After a break of almost four months, Orfevre returned to the racecourse in September to win the Group 2 Kobe Shimbun Hai, again beating Win Variation. In October he completed the Triple Crown by winning the Kikuka Sho, with Win Variation finishing second yet again. On his final start of the year, Orfevre contested the Arima Kinen on 25 December, facing older horses for the first time. The field included Buena Vista, Jaguar Mail, Victoire Pisa, Tosen Jordan and Hiruno d'Amour. Orfevre made a late run on the outside to win by three quarters of a length from Eishin Flash. 2012: four- year-old season Orfevre lost his first two races at the age of four. In the Group 2 Hansin Daishoten on 18 March he was virtually pulled up midway through the race before accelerating again to finish second. He then ran poorly when finishing eleventh in the Tenno Sho on 29 April. In June he returned to form to win the Takarazuka Kinen by two lengths from Rulership. In the late summer of 2012, Orfevre was sent to Europe to prepare for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In September he won his trial race by beating Meandre in the Prix Foy over the Arc course and distance. In the Arc de Triomphe he started favourite ahead of the Epsom Derby winner Camelot, despite being given an unfavourable outside draw. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon, he was restrained at the back of the eighteen runner field before making rapid progress on the outside to take the lead in the straight. Orfevre opened up a clear advantage 200 metres from the finish, but then veered sharply right towards the inside rail. In the closing stages he was caught by the filly Solemia and finished second by a neck, seven lengths clear of the other runners. After returning Japan his next race was the Japan Cup on 24 November. The race saw a close finish between Orfevre and the 2012 Fillies Triple Crown heroine Gentildonna. Orfevre was triple crown champion (male) the previous year. In the last 200 meters, he appeared to haven been bumped off his racing line by Gentildonna who crossed the line a nose to in front of the colt. The subsequent stewards' inquiry found that although interference had taken place, the result was allowed to stand, even though they handed down Gentildonna's jockey Yasunari Iwata a two-day suspension. Orfevre's Arc rival Solemia raced prominently throughout the race, but finished midfield. Despite receiving most fan votes in Arima Kinen, Orfevre's side decided not to field him the race as defending winner, as he had not recovered sufficiently from the Arc and Japan Cup. At the JRA Awards in January 2013, Orfevre won the JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse, taking 273 of the 289 votes. In the Horse of the Year poll he finished third to Gentildonna and Gold Ship. 2013: five-year-old season On his five-year-old debut, Orfevre ran in the Sankei Osaka Hai at Hanshin on 31 March. He started the 1/5 favourite and won from Shonan Mighty and Eishin Flash. Orfevre was expected to defend the Takarazuka Kinen on 23 June, but a nine days before the race he bled after an exercise gallop. After exercise- induced pulmonary hemorrhage was diagnosed, Ikee decided to withdraw the horse from the race and target the Arc again. As in the previous year, Orfevre was sent to Europe in the autumn on 2013 and ran in the Prix Foy as his trial race for the Arc. On 15 September he started as 4/6 favorite against eight opponents including Dunaden after the late withdrawal of Camelot. Ridden by Soumilllon, he took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won easily by three lengths from Very Nice Name. In the Arc, Orfevre was made 13/10 favourite in a field of seventeen runners. He was restrained behind the leaders by Soumillon before moving forward in the straight and finished second for the second consecutive year, five length behind the winner Treve. Orfevre missed the Japan Cup and ran his final race in the Arima Kinen on 21 December. In front of a crowd of 124,782, he started the 3/5 favourite against fifteen opponents, with Gold Ship (17/5) being the only horse seriously backed against him. Kenichi Ikezoe restrained the colt in the early stages before moving forward on the final turn. Orfevre took the lead and drew away from the field to win by eight lengths from Win Variation, with Gold Ship in third. Later that evening, Orfevre paraded in front of 60,000 fans in his official retirement ceremony.Racing Post At the JRA Awards in January 2013, Orfevre defended JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse with 176 votes, beating sprinter Lord Kanaloa in 104. However, in Japanese Horse of the Year, he only voted in second place to Lord Kanaloa in a 209-69 margin. In the 2013 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Orfevre tied with Wise Dan for third place behind Treve and Black Caviar. Stud record Orfevre's first crop of foals included Epoca d'Oro and Lucky Lilac. Pedigree *Orfevre is inbred 3 x 4 to Northern Taste, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

It is well known as the host rock for major deposits of shale oil and shale gas.

The US EIA estimates total recoverable hydrocarbons from this Vaca Muerta Formation to be of oil and of natural gas, more than even the Neuqu√©n Basin's hydrocarbon-rich Middle Jurassic Los Molles Formation holds.  Geology  Stratigraphy of the Vaca Muerta Formation The Vaca Muerta Shale is a continuous tight oil and shale gas reservoir of Late Jurassic (Tithonian) and Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) age. The formation covers a total area of . The shale is at a depth of about , where it has been found productive of oil and gas. Although called a shale, and with a total organic carbon content varying from 1 percent to 5 percent, the Vaca Muerta is predominately marl and consists of mature black shales, marls and lime mudstones. Formed in a marine environment with little clay and brittle rock, the deposit is (usually over ) thick, extending throughout the basin. Although the name Vaca Muerta Formation was introduced to the geological literature in 1931 by American geologist Charles E. Weaver, the highly bituminous shales in the Salado River valley in southern Mendoza were described in 1892 by Dr. Guillermo Bodenbender. German paleontologists Beherendsen and Steuer determined the Tithonian age of these shales. In several outcrop locations, the Vaca Muerta Formation has been the site of paleontological finds: the crocodylomorph Cricosaurus and possibly Geosaurus, the ichthyosaur Caypullisaurus, and the pterosaurs Herbstosaurus and Wenupteryx. The Vaca Muerta Formation represents the most distal facies of the Lower Mendoza Mesosequence, a Tithonian‚ÄìValanginian broad shallowing-upward sedimentary cycle.Legarreta, L., Gulisano, C.A., 1989.

Oil and gas exploration and production  The Vaca Muerta Shale has long been known as a major petroleum source rock for other formations in the Neuqu√©n Basin, which has had oil production since 1918. Wells producing from the Vaca Muerta itself are in several oil fields, including the Loma La Lata, Loma Lata Norte,Loma Lata Norte and Loma Campana fields. Repsol-YPF recognized the productive potential of the Vaca Muerta Shale of the Neuqu√©n Basin, and completed Argentina's first shale gas well in July 2010, at the Loma La Lata field. Then in November 2010, the company completed a tight oil well in the Vaca Muerta Shale in the Loma Campana area. The first horizontal well in the Vaca Muerta was drilled and completed in August 2011. By October 2012, 31 wells had been drilled and completed, and another 20 had been drilled and were waiting completion. The drilling had extended the Vaca Muerta producing extent to an area of at least .Carol Cain McGowen, \\"Argentina's Vaca Muerta draws GTW spotlight\\" AAPG Explorer, Jan. 2013. One problem in attracting development was Argentina's price controls on natural gas, keeping the price down to US$2.00-$2.50 per million BTU. However, the government exempted tight gas from controls, and in 2011 the Vaca Muerta gas was selling for US$4‚Äì$7. The higher gas prices attracted major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Total S.A.,https://www.ep.total.com/en/areas/unconventional- resources/vaca-muerta-bold-unconventional-development Exploration Production - Vaca Muerta - Total and Chevron Corporation to Vaca Muerta.Scott L. Weeden, \\"Argentina's shale-gas plays bring back majors,\\" E&P; Magazine, 3 Oct. 2011. In September 2016, after the change of government in Argentina, YPF said that proposed new rates for gas would permit the continued development of gas in Vaca Muerta. Tarifas de gas In May 2013, YPF announced that it had negotiated a joint venture in which Chevron would invest US$1.5 billion drilling 132 wells on the Loma Campana field. Chevron's participation was complicated by efforts by the plaintiffs who obtained a judgement in Ecuador with respect to actions by Texaco in the Lago Agrio oil field to collect the judgement from Chevron's Argentine assets. On September 24, 2013, YPF announced that Dow Chemical Company subsidiary Dow Argentina had signed an agreement to drill 16 natural gas wells in the El Orejano block of the Vaca Muerta formation over a 12-month period, with Dow contributing US$120,000,000 and YPF US$68,000,000. Firma Dow Shell Argentina CEO Juan Jose Aranguren was quoted on December 10, 2013, as saying his company, with 4 producing wells in Vaca Muerta and 2 more drilling, would increase capital spending in Argentine shale to \\"about\\" US$500 million in 2014 from US$170 million in 2013. Luis Sapag, of the Sapag family which has dominated Neuqu√©n politics for half a century, was reported by Bloomberg in December 2013 as saying that the YPF-Chevron joint venture would invest as much as US$16 billion if the US$1.2 billion pilot venture was successful by March 2014, which would generate almost US$9 billion in royalties for Neuqu√©n. In January 2015 YPF indicated that it and Chevron had already invested over US$3 billion in their Loma Campana venture, which YPF described as the most important unconventional (oil) project in the world outside the United States. YPF y Sinopec firman un MOU para desarrollar nuevos proyectos de petroleo y gas en el pa√≠s  Developments as of 2014  In February 2014, Archer Ltd. announced it had an \\"approximately US$400 million\\" contract with YPF to provide \\"five new built drilling rigs to support YPF's development of unconventional shale resources in the Neuqu√©n area in Argentina.\\"Archer secures drilling contract with YPF S.A. in Argentina On February 18 of the same year, YPF announced that it had signed an memorandum of understanding with PETRONAS, the Malaysian state oil company, on a possible investment (agreed upon in the following August; see below) in the 187 square kilometer Amarga Chica zone of the Vaca Muerta formation; YPF also indicated that its current production in Vaca Muerta was over 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from over 150 fracked wells using 19 fracking drill rigs. Helmerich & Payne disclosed on March 5, 2014, that it had contracted with YPF to deploy 10 drill rigs under five-year contracts from the United States to Argentina between the third quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 to work in the Vaca Muerta play in addition to the nine rigs Helmerich & Payne already had in the country.03/05/14, \\"Helmerich & Payne Announces Contract Awards in Argentina\\" On April 10, 2014, Miguel Gallucio of YPF announced that Chevron had decided to continue its partnership with YPF in the \\"massive development\\" of Vaca Muerta; the US$1.24 billion pilot program financed by Chevron and ended in March had developed 161 fracked wells in a 20 square kilometer area. The new phase would frack 170 additional wells that year with a joint investment of over US$1.6 billion, with YPF continuing as operator. The goal agreed upon for future years would be to develop an area of 395 square kilometers with over 1500 fracked wells producing over 50,000 barrels of oil and 3 million cubic meters (over 100 million cubic feet) of natural gas a day. Chevron and YPF also agreed on a US$140,000,000, four-year exploration project to drill and analyze 7 vertical and 2 horizontal wells in a 200 square kilometer area (Narambuena) in the Chihuido de la Sierra Negra concession, to be financed by Chevron with YPF as operator.http://www.ypf.com/YPFHoy/YPFSalaPrensa/Paginas/Chevron_decidio_continuar_con_la_etapa_de_desarrollo_masivo_en_Vaca- Muerta.aspx In an interview with the Argentine newspaper La Naci√≥n published September 14, 2014, Gallucio indicated that production in the Loma Campana field had reached 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1727192-miguel-gallucio-para-las-inversiones- hacen-falta-reglas-y-cumplirlas On October 8, 2014, Argentine Industry Minister D√©bora Georgi reported that YPF had signed a confidential agreement in principle with Gazprom that could lead to a US$1 billion investment in gas exploration and production \\"in Argentina\\"; YPF denied the report, but did sign a memorandum on cooperation with Gazprom in April 2015. YPF desminti√≥ a Debora Giorgi sobre la firma del acuerdo de confidencialidad con la empresa rusa Gazprom In January 2015 YPF and Sinopec signed a memorandum of understanding for future cooperation in both conventional and unconventional petroleum development; they indicated that Sinopec Argentina Exploration and Production S.A. was already doing due diligence on exploration and development in \\"certain areas\\" of Vaca Muerta together with YPF. In April 2015, Gallucio stated that production in the Loma Campana field had reached 44,000-45,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. In June 2015, YPF announced a new discovery in Vaca Muerta, this time in the La Ribera I block, with an initial output of 43,000 cubic meters (over 1 1/2 million cubic feet) of gas a day. YPF anuncia un nievo descubrimiento de gas no convencional en Neuqu√©n In November 2015, YPF indicated that production from Vaca Muerta was 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily, with 47,000 from Loma Campana; it also indicated that Chevron had invested US$2,500,000,000 over the last two years. YPF informa YPF showed production for the third quarter of 2016 at 58,200 barrels of oil equivalent daily from 522 wells, with 11 rigs working. Acuerdo de continuidad YPF-Petronas  Blocks  Vaca Muerta is divided into different development blocks. Consortium of YPF (50%) and Chevron (50%) develops General Enrique Mosconi concession, including Loma La Lata Norte and Loma Campana fields. Consortium of Petrobras (55%, operator) and Total S.A. (45%) develops the Rincon de Aranda concession. The Los Toldos blocks are developed by the consortium of Americas Petrogas (45%, operator of the blocks), ExxonMobil (45%) and Gas y Petroleo del Neuqu√©n (10%). Consortium of Shell (65%, operator) Medanito (25%) and Gas y Petroleo del Neuqu√©n (10%) develops √Åguila Mora and Sierras Blancas areas. Consortium of Wintershall (50%, operator) and Gas y Petroleo del Neuqu√©n (50%) develops the Aguada Federal block. The Bandurria block was formerly a joint venture of Pan American Energy, YPF, and Wintershall; it has now been split into three blocks, with Wintershall as operator of Bandurria Norte, Pan American Energy as operator of Bandurria Centro, and YPF as operator of Bandurria Sur. YPF indicated in July 2015 that it planned to drill 20 wells in Bandurria Sur with the goal of beginning shale oil production within three years at a cost of US$282.2 million.Shale fields to get $14 billion boost ExxonMobil is the operator of the Bajo del Choique and La Invernada blocks and has an 85% working interest in them, with Gas y Petroleo del Neuqu√©n holding the remaining 15%; they announced their first discovery on the former block in May 2014, and their first discovery on the latter in the following December.ExxonMobil discovers oil and gas in ArgentinaExxon makes second discovert in Argentina's Vaca Muerta YPF and the Malaysian state oil company PETRONAS signed an agreement on August 28, 2014, whereby PETRONAS would receive a 50% interest together with YPF in return for contributing US$475 million as part of a three-year, US$550 million, pilot project of development in the Amarga Chica block, with YPF as operator. Acuerdo YPF-Petronas In November 2016 YPF and PETRONAS announced that they had spent US$165 million drilling 9 wells in the initial phase of Amarga Chica development, and that they had agreed to move to a second stage where they would spend another US$192.5 million on drilling 10 horizontal wells and constructing surface facilities. The El Orejano block, which (as mentioned above) YPF and Dow Argentina agreed to develop in 2013, was producing 750,000 cubic meters of shale gas (nearly 26 1/2 million cubic feet) daily from a total of 19 wells by December 2015; Dow and YPF agreed to invest another US$500 million in 2016 on top of the US$350 million already invested, and drill 30 more wells in order to triple that output. Acuerdo YPF y Dow In January 2016, Aubrey McClendon's American Energy Partners, LP, and YPF announced a preliminary agreement for the development of two more blocks, at a cost of over US$500 million in the next three years: Bajada de A√±elo and the southern zone of Cerro Arena, the latter together with Pluspetrol and Gas y Petr√≥leo del Neuqu√©n; an affiliate of American Energy Partners would acquire up to a 50% participation in both. Also Madalena Ventures, Azabache, and Tecpetrol participate in exploration and production. Apache Corporation was active in the Vaca Muerta in 2012-2013, but agreed to sell all its Argentine assets to YPF for US$800 million in an agreement signed February 12, 2014.

When he was 17 years old, his father died of cancer. In December 2011, Carldell said that, \\"My whole life, I‚Äôve been trying to grind it out and work hard to get where I need to be. My father died from cancer, and I grew up in a tough neighborhood in (eastern) New Orleans, where guys would get bored and find time to get into other things, like stealing cars and walking around looking for fights. But Coach Tillman would always pick me up and have us going to practice, whether it was basketball season or not.\\" He attended John F. Kennedy High School in New Orleans and transferred to Marion Abramson High School for his senior year. At Abramson he played basketball under head coach Robert Tillman.

(1808‚Äì1865) was a German Lutheran pastor who was nicknamed the \\"Reviver of the Heath\\" (Erwecker der Heide). One of the most significant Christian revivalists of the 19th century, he turned the little village of Hermannsburg on the L√ºneburg Heath into the most important centre of revival in Lower Saxony.  Life   Youth and training  Louis Harms was born on 5 May 1808 in Walsrode in north Germany as the second son of a pastor, Hartwig Christian Harms. His mother was Lucie Dorothee Friederike Harms, n√©e Heinze. In 1817 the family moved to Hermannsburg and, in 1825, Louis Harms went to the secondary school in Celle. After passing his A-levels in Celle, Harms studied Protestant theology in G√∂ttingen from 1827 to 1830. His study forced him to confront the Enlightenment, the leading intellectual movement of his time. When he read the verse John 17:3 \\"Now this is eternal life: that they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent\\"Holy Bible, New International Version. he came in 1830 to the conclusion that \\"it is not enough, just to be religious and good, to live sensibly and act properly, but that it is essential to have Jesus Christ at the centre of one's life and to testify to that.\\"  Career development  After passing his exam with honours, Louis Harms worked from 1830 to 1840 as a private tutor for the Lord Chamberlain of Linstow in Lauenburg/Elbe. During this time he held Bible studies and, in 1834, and founded the Lauenburg Mission Society. After Harms had passed two other theological examinations, but still had no prospect of becoming a pastor, he helped his father in Hermannsburg. Then he returned to being a private tutor in 1840 for the family of state architect, Pampel, in L√ºneburg. In Lauenburg and L√ºneburg he came across slums, moral neglect and children whose lives were a misery. As a result, visits to the poor, the sick and prisoners became a natural consequence of his faith, an approach that was by no means common at that time. To support his sick father, at the end of 1843, he returned to Hermannsburg. Harms was appointed as curate to relieve his father and was ordained to the ministry on 20 November 1844. In 1846, he managed to turn the parish of Hermannsburg from a \\"benevolent society\\" of the Celle Missionary Society into a \\"mission parish\\". Through his church services, parlour gatherings in the rectory, home visits and counselling, a revival started in Hermannsburg. At the request of the municipality, Louis Harms was appointed by the Consistory in Hanover for the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover as the pastor at Hermannsburg after the death of his father in 1849. Harms had a great gift for speaking in a way that brought things to life. On Sunday evenings, the villagers gathered in the hallway of the rectory to listen to him. His stories simultaneously entertained, instructed and built people up. Local history provided him with lively material. His stories were published in the anthologies Honnig (Low German: \\"Honey\\") and Goldene √Ñpfel in silbernen Schalen (\\"Golden Apples in Silver Dishes\\"). Since 1846, at Epiphany on 6 January at irregular intervals, and once a year since 1851, on St John's Eve (24 June), the mission festival is held, to which up to 6,000 came. Amongst its best-known visitors were the Hamburg merchant, Johann Hinrich Nagel (1810‚Äì1900), and Elise Averdieck (1808‚Äì1907), who later founded the Bethesda Deaconess House in Hamburg. Even today, the mission festival is celebrated on a weekend around 24 June in the park of the mission seminary. Hermannsburg On 12 October 1849 Harms founded the Hermannsburg Mission Centre (Missionsanstalt Hermannsburg) by opening the mission seminary. His brother Theodor (1818‚Äì1885) was invited to be its first head or Inspektor. The first twelve seminary students studied in what is today the Ludwig Harms House. Model of the mission ship, Candace, in Ludwig Harms House in Hermannsburg In 1853, the first seminary course passed their theological examination before the consistory at Stade and were ordained to the ministry. The first 16 missionaries (including eight tradesmen and peasants) were sent by Louis Harms into mission service and left on 28 October 1853 on the mission ship, Candace. The Candace, which had been launched on 27 September 1853 in Harburg, was financed by donations from friends of the mission, especially those to whom Harms had preached. The Hamburg businessman, Nagel, in particular, stands out. Until its sale in 1874, the ship went on thirteen journeys. The original pennant of the ship is now on display in the Louis Harms House in Hermannsburg. Louis Harms led the work overseas as mission director from the rectory. Harms mastered many languages. In addition to his native language of German, he learnt Latin, Greek (modern and ancient Greek), Hebrew, Italian, English and French. After the attempt to get to Ethiopia had failed, the missionaries landed in Port Natal in 1854 (now Durban, South Africa) and began missionary work among the Zulus. In the same year the Hermannsburger Missionsblatt newsletter appeared for first time, a publication that still informs interested parties about the work of the mission. To support the mission work in 1856 also founded a mission trading shop. Louis Harm's grave in Hermannsburg Cemetery Harms also took care of youth offenders after they were released. From 1858 he obtained accommodation and work for them. In 1862 the mission seminary moved to the \\"New Mission House\\" where it is today and where young people are trained for missionary service. During the lifetime of Louis Harms, mission work started in India in 1864. Physically very weakened Louis Harms died on 14 November 1865 in Hermannsburg, after having given his last sermon on 5 November in Hermannsburg's St. Peter and St. Paul's Church. He was buried in Hermannsburg Cemetery. His grave is still there today.  Hermannsburg Mission today  The work of the Hermannsburg Mission is carried on today by the Evangelical-Lutheran Mission in Lower Saxony (ELM), which has been jointly run by the three Lower Saxon state churches of Hanover, Brunswick and Schaumburg-Lippe since 1977.

Biography His parents, who were Armenians, christened him Hatchik, which he later changed to Christopher. He learned from private tutors the Armenian, Turkish, and modern Greek languages; to these he soon added Italian and French, and, having heard English spoken, he wished to learn it also. To this end he made the acquaintance of the American missionaries that had then lately arrived in Turkey. One of these, Harrison G. O. Dwight, took an interest in him, and after the death of Oscanyan's mother enabled him to go to the United States to obtain a liberal education. Oscanyan arrived in New York City in 1835 and was at once matriculated at the University of the City of New York. Failing health compelled him to leave college in his junior year, and he joined the staff of civil engineers engaged in the construction of the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad. Returning to Constantinople in 1841, he established the first newspaper that was published there in Armenian, the Astarar P√ºzantian (Byzantine Advertiser). But the authorities would not tolerate the expression of liberal opinions, and he was soon compelled to abandon the undertaking. In 1843 he became the private secretary of Ahmed Fethi Pasha, son-in-law of the sultan, and minister of ordnance. While he was thus engaged he was appointed special agent to purchase the trousseau of Adil√© Sultana, who was about to be married to Mehmed Aali Pasha, and in this capacity he frequently visited the palace. After the ceremony, Oscanyan acted as correspondent for several American and European newspapers. In 1849 he wrote a satirical romance in Armeno-Turkish, or Turkish written in the Armenian character, entitled Acaby. This was followed in 1851 by Veronica, another work of fiction, and by Bedig, a book for children. The same year he published an Armenian translation of The Mysteries of Paris. In 1853, with the assistance of others, he opened an Oriental museum in London, but the enterprise was not successful and he returned to New York. In New York, Oscanyan wrote and published The Sultan and His People (New York, 1857), 16,000 copies of which were sold in four months. In 1868 Oscanyan was made Turkish consul general in New York City, and he held the office until 1874. Having occasion to visit Constantinople in 1872, he was assigned by the porte as the representative of the sultan in entertaining Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman during his visit to Turkey. On resigning his consulship he again busied himself in literary pursuits in New York City. He wrote another work on Turkey and the libretto of a comic opera.

It travels in the shape of a capital J, starting northwest, veering northeast, and then turning north, serving the communities of Lutcher and Gramercy and providing a connection to Interstate 10 (I-10) for those towns. Route description LA 641 starts at LA 44 (Jefferson Highway) in Lutcher and traverses north on Albert Street. It then crosses the Illinois Central Railroad and goes eastward on West Main Street. LA 641 intersects Lutcher Avenue (LA 3193) and North Airline Avenue (LA 3274, which was formerly LA 20). East of North Airline, the street is called East Main Street. Past Golden Grove Road, LA 641 resumes a north-south routing to meet LA 3125 near the Kansas City Southern Railway. The two highways are concurrent for until LA 3125 ends at a junction with LA 3213. From that ending, LA 641, traverses north, crossing the Kansas City Southern Railway and Airline Highway (U.S. Route 61) and traverses north through the Maurepas Swamp. LA 641 ends at I-10 where it crosses the highway at milepost 194. LA 641 traverses a residential- commercial mix area in Lutcher and Gramercy, followed by an industrial area north of Gramercy. North of Airline Highway, the road traverses a secluded wetland before intersecting I-10. With the exception of the area immediately north and south of its intersection with Airline Highway, LA-641 is an undivided two-lane route in its entirety. It is a divided two-lane route in its short concurrency with LA 3125 and a four-lane road between LA 3213 and Airline Highway. History LA 641 was originally conceived as a local route to serve Gramercy and Lutcher. The road traversed the two communities, serving local traffic, while LA 44 served through traffic among River Road communities. The southern part of the highway remains in its same 1955-era routing, using Albert Street and Main Street; however, the route originally returned to LA-44 by crossing the Illinois Central Railroad just east of LA 20 (present day LA 3274). In 1981, LA 641 was rerouted to its present routing north of Gramercy to connect to I-10. With the completion of the Gramercy Bridge (or Veterans Memorial Bridge) across the Mississippi River between Gramercy and Wallace, the new state highway (LA 3213) intersected with LA 641 just south of the Kansas City Southern Railway. The northern part of the road, albeit the most rural, serves as a connector route to industrial interests along Airline Highway and River Road in St. James and St. John parishes, the Gramercy Bridge, and plantation sightseeing on both sides of the Mississippi River.

It was founded in 1953 and began classes in 1959. John Knox currently has an enrollment of about 350+ students. JKCS is a member of the Ontario Alliance of Christian Schools (OACS). History In 1953, several Christian families from the Clarkson Christian Reformed Church came together to form a Christian elementary school. John Knox Christian School opened for operation in September 1959, with Mr. Van Dijk as principal. Two classrooms were set up in the basement of the Clarkson Christian Reformed Church with 44 students in eight grades. In 1961, a three-classroom building at 1884 Lakeshore Road West in Clarkson was opened. An additional two- classroom addition was ready by September 1963. In 1981 another classroom, a staff room and a gymnasium were opened. In 1983, a senior kindergarten program was implemented in the basement of the Clarkson Christian Reformed Church. Junior kindergarten followed in 1984. Further expansion in 1988 necessitated the placement of two portable classrooms on the playground. In 1992, a Building Planning Committee began to search for a location to accommodate continuing growth. In 1994 a new property was purchased and in 1995 construction began. The school doors opened at 2232 Sheridan Garden Drive, Oakville in September 1995 with 259 students and 16 staff. The student body continued to grow in numbers so that during the summer of 1996 the portables from the old school in Mississauga were transported to the new location and refurbished to accommodate an enrollment of 305 and 18 staff members in September 1996. In the summer of 1999, the new facility was expanded to include an additional computer lab, an art room, a music room and additional classrooms. The portable classrooms were also removed at this time. The school has a capacity for 395 students from junior kindergarten to grade 8.http://www.jkcs-oakville.org/school-history Athletics JKCS's school colors are burgundy and white and has a variety of sports teams, for both junior (grades 5&6) and senior (grades 7&8) grades, such as girls and boys soccer, volleyball, basketball, hockey, and badminton.

Galpin was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1977 for his services to the newspaper industry. As General Manager (South) and a Director of the Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers, Galpin was responsible for introducing web offset printing to the Portsmouth Evening News and managing the newspaper‚Äôs move to its Hilsea location in 1969. This made the newspaper the first newspaper in the world with a circulation of over 100,000 copies to use computerised printing technology and colour photocomposition. Military career After completing Officer Cadet training, Galpin was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant of the Royal Regiment of Artillery on 19 September 1943. He was awarded a variety of medals for his military service including the Efficiency Medal. During the Second World War, Galpin was a member of the Royal Artillery regiment, where he served in Portsmouth during the Battle of Britain. He then served overseas in North Africa, most notably in the Second Battle of El Alamein. Following his service in North Africa, and the Middle East, he was transferred to the infantry and fought in Italy; here, he was wounded in action before returning to the front line. Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd. Galpin's career at the newspaper group began in 1933 when he started work as a junior clerk in the London office. He resumed his newspaper career after the war in 1946 and, after attending night school, qualified as a chartered secretary in 1948. In the following years he was Company Secretary at the London office and in 1962 he was promoted to General Manager (South) and a Director of the company in Portsmouth. In this latter role, he managed the move to web offset printing and computerised photocomposition in 1969. As part of this, the newspaper moved to a new production plant at Hilsea, where The News is still printed today. The Evening News was consequently at the forefront of technological advancements in the newspaper industry, with the technology eventually adopted by most newspapers in the UK. The move from so-called ‚Äòhot- type‚Äô to ‚Äòcold-type‚Äô typesetting (photocomposition) streamlined the production process and allowed newspapers to be printed much more quickly than in the past. It was local newspapers rather than the nationals which were ‚Äòleading the computer revolution‚Äô in the industry. By managing this process in Portsmouth, Galpin \\"guided the destinies of both daily and weekly newspapers into an era of clarity of print which was inconceivable at the threshold of his career\\". He retired as General Manager in 1976 and was awarded his OBE in 1977, the year of the centenary of the Portsmouth Evening News. He accepted his OBE as \\"recognition of the work of all staff who had maintained uninterrupted publication of the newspapers\\".

This shore has been a witness to many historic events, including pitched naval battles and the arrival of ships from distant lands. Uddanda, a Sanskrit poet in Zamorin's court, wrote in his Kokila Sande≈õa: \\"The ocean, the father of the goddess of riches [Indira is a synonym of Lakshmi] seeing that his daughter has settled down in Kukkatakroda [Sanskrit for Kozhikode], is embracing the place, presenting it with shipful of jewels\\".Kokilasandesham, Sloka 67 Several national leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Indira Gandhi and Krishna Menon have addressed people here. The 'Beach Road' was renamed Gandhi Road from Evan's Road after Mahatma Gandhi's visit in January 1934. Two dilapidated piers can be seen extending into the sea. The 'Iron Screw-pile' pier to the north was built in 1871, with a 'T' end. Numerous cranes on these piers once loaded spices and other goods destined to foreign ports like Aden, Genoa, Oslo, London, Bremen, Hamburg, New York City etc. Near the northern pier is a park maintained by the Lions club, a children's park, the lighthouse with a seafarer's memorial and a marine aquarium. Further north to the Lions' Park is a dirty fishing area where once was located a French loge with factories and French settlements. Near the south pier is a place called 'Horse's Jumping Point' where horses brought from Gujarat and Arabia were made to jump into the water, swim and would gallop along the shore and be displayed for sale. The beach offers a pleasant view at times of fishermen entering the sea with their tiny boats, fighting the waves and returning with their catch.

In spite of creeping signs of modernity over hundreds of years, this crowded part of the city offers the best chance to visualize daily life at a commercial hub in medieval Calicut. Muslim, Jain and Hindu seths, Gujarathi and Marwari moneylenders and Tamil and Andhra Chettis can be seen busy with their businesses, as they did for centuries. Merchants and accountants still use a unique system of finger-code language as noted by Ma Huang of Zheng He's fleet in 1403. The legend has it that the first secretary of the Zamorin, Mangat Achan, after a long penance had the goddess of wealth Lakshmi appear before him. He then made her promise to wait until he returned but went home and committed suicide. Unable to break her promise, it is said, Lakshmi stayed permanently in Veliyangadi. Mananchira and nearby institutions A sculpture by Jacek Tylicki: \\"Give If You Can - Take If You Have To\\" Mananchira is a large tank in the heart of the city. Mananchira or Mana Vikraman Tank (Manan or Mana Vikraman being the Coronation name of the Zamorins) seems to have been the drinking water source for the entire Palace complex (previously located at the Kottaparambu Women and Children Hospital). Surrounding the Mananchira are several important institutions. The Town Hall was constructed in 1891 by the salt merchants (previously called Salt Abkari Town Hall) and has been an important stage for several popular agitations and ceremonies during the freedom movement and thereafter. The Pattalapalli or 'Military Mosque' was originally built for the Mysore soldiers who had surrounded the Palace during the 'Mysore invasion'. The Comtrust Textile Factory (previously the Commonwealth Weaving Factory) was established in 1884 by the Basel Mission from Germany. To the western side of Mananchira is located the C.S.I. Church, Basel Mission Complex and the BEM (Basel Evangelical Mission) Girls' School (1848). Once the main courtyard of the Zamorin Ruler's palace, the Mananchira ground along with the older Ansari Park (named after the freedom fighter Ansari) has been developed into a well- maintained park called 'Mananchira Square'. It has a green carpet lawn fenced with laterite- sculpted walls. The entire complex is circled by 250 lamp posts designed in 'colonial' style. The 'Square' has an artificial stream, a musical fountain, an open-air theatre and a music stage. There is a public library near mananchira square which has a collection of huge variety of books.

The temple's date of origin is uncertain but was most likely built during the foundation of the city itself in the 12th century or before. The temple is surrounded by gigantic walls of 'elephant belly' (aana palla) type with broad base and narrower neck at the top. One of the two tanks attached to the temple can be seen to the right. The temple hosts the annual 'competition for scholars' called Revathi Pattathanam attended by eminent scholars and philophers of Bharatiya Mimamsa, Prabhakara Mimamsa, Vedanta Mimamsa and Vyakarana. The temple was also the site for the famous anti-caste agitation of 1911 organized by Krishna Vakil (editor of Mitavadi) and advocate Manjeri Rama Ayyar for the rights of 'low-caste' people to use the road between the tank and the temple. Mishkal Mosque Mishkal Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Kerala. The Mosque was built by an Arab merchant, Nakhooda Mishkal, nearly 650 years ago. It is named Mishkal Mosque after him. It is located in Kuttichira, a part of Thekkepuram region in Kozhikode city. In 1510, the mosque was partially burned in a Portuguese attack. The top floors of the mosque still display some of that damage. Mishkal Mosque originally had five stories. It was reconstructed after the fire in 1510 and now has four stories. Typical for similarly aged mosques of the region, it has no cupolas and minarets and heavily employs timber. According to some historians, Kerala‚Äôs temple architecture influenced the architecture of old mosques in Kerala which have gopuram-style entrance arches and no minarets. Panniyankara Bhagavati Temple The Bhagavaty temple on a hillock on the southern side of Kallayi river is one of the two pre-Calicut temples known to historians, built at least two centuries before the foundation of the city. This area must have come under the territory of Porlathiri during the reign of Ceraman Perumal. It is a typical Chera period structure with a square garbhagriha and mandapa and probably had a currambalam and prakara (outer walls) that are no more. Two granite slabs dating to the 10‚Äì11th century AD were recovered recently carrying three inscriptions in Vattezhuthu, an old Malayalam language. One is a record of a land grant of the Chera king Ravi Kota, who was crowned in 1021 AD.Narayanan M.G.S., Perumals of Kerala, Kozhikode (1996) Mentioned in the inscription are functionaries like Adhikarar (officials), Alkoyil (king's representative) and Poduval (temple secretary) and avirodham (a system of unanimous resolution), kalam (an old measure), etc. The second inscription dating back to 883‚Äì913 AD records a decision by the Taliyar and Tali Adhikarikal of 'Panriyankarai' to conduct seven Tiruvakkiram (sacred feast) at the shrine of Patari (female deity). The third inscription records a unanimous decision to transfer some land belonging to the daughter of the Chief Queen of Cheraman Perumal for the conduct of Tiru amritu (sacred feast). Thiruvannur Siva Temple This Siva temple has an apsidal garbhagriha, decorated with typical Chola pillars and pilasters, panjaras and vyalimukhas. The central shrine has escaped any repair or change and is relatively well preserved. An inscription unearthed records a land grant given to Tirumannur Patarakar in the eighth regnal year of Raja Raja Chola. The record has been dated to 1044 AD. The deity appears to have been a Jain Tirthankara (since the rules of Thirukkunavaye, the premier Jain shrine of Kerala in Kodungalloor, are cited in the punitive clauses). The Jain temple must have been converted into a Siva temples sometime in the 11th century before the arrival of the Zamorins.Narayanan M.G.S., Kozhikode: The City of Truth. p.109, Calicut University Press (2006) The apsidal shrine and other features are attributable to this period.

Life Nasr al-Din was of Central Asian origin, being a Muslim Khwarezmian from Bukhara. His father was the prominent leader Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar. When Genghis Khan attacked the city during the war between the Khwarizmi shah and the Mongols, Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar's family surrendered to him. Sayyid Ajjal served the court of the Mongol Empire. Later, Sayyid Ajjal was in charge of Imperial finances in 1259,(Original from the University of California) sent to Yunnan by Kublai Khan after conquering the Kingdom of Dali in 1274. In the thirteenth century the influence of individual Muslims was immense, especially that of the Seyyid Edjell Shams ed-Din Omar, who served the Mongol Khans till his death in Yunnan AD 1279. His family still exists in Yunnan, and has taken a prominent part in Muslim affairs in China.(Original from Harvard University) Nasr al-Din is identified as the ancestor of many Chinese Hui lineages in Yunnan's Panthay Hui population as well as in Ningxia and Fujian provinces. Marco Polo claimed that Nasr al-Din was a commander in the 1277 Mongol invasion of Burma and defeated the Burmese in the war. Marco Polo recorded his name as \\"Nescradin\\".( ) This claim by Marco Polo was false. The widespread presence of Islam in Yunnan is due to Nasir Al-Din and his father Sayyid Ajall. Nasr became Yunnan's governor after his father, the first governor of Yunnan, died.(Original from the University of Virginia) served in his office from 1279 to 1284.(Original from Indiana University) He was sent to participate in the 1284 Mongol invasion of Burma, which caused his term as governor to end.( ) Nasr also battled the native \\"Gold Teeth\\" people in Yunnan, and the Vietnamese during the Mongol invasion of Annam. Marco Polo had been wrong in claiming that Nasr had participated in the 1277 attack on Burma, Nasr fought in the 1284 invasion in reality. He was transferred to Shaanxi and appointed as its governor.( ) Nasr al-Din's son Omar ÁÉèÈ¶¨ÂÖí (Wu-ma-r) participated alongside him in the invasion of Annam (Vietnam). His service as Governor there ended in his death in 1292, when he was charged with corruption and executed. Husayn, a brother of his, then became the next governor.(In Yunnan)( ) Family Nasr al-Din's father was the Governor of Yunnan, Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, whose Chinese name was Sai-dien-ch'i. Nasr al-Din's name in Chinese was \\"Na-su-la-ding\\". Five sons of Sai-dien-ch'i are mentioned, viz. Á¥çÈÄüÂâå‰∏Å Na-su-la-ding (Nasr-uddin), ÂìàÊï£ Hasan (Hassan), ÂøΩËæõ Hu-sin (Hussein), Ââå‰∏Å ÂÖÄÈªòÈáå Shan-su-ding wu-mo-li and È¶¨ÈÄüÂøΩ Ma-su-hu. All these held high offices. Na-su-la-ding has a separate biography in the same chapter. He was governor in Yunnan, and distinguished himself in the war with the southern tribes of ‰∫§Ë∂æ Kiao-chi (Cochin-china) and Á∑¨ Mien (Burma). He died in 1292, the father of twelve sons^ the names of five of which are given in the biography, viz. ‰ºØÈ°èÂØüÂÖí Bo-yen ch'a-r, who had a high office, ÁÉèÈ¶¨ÂÖí Wu-ma-r, Á≠îÊ≥ïÂÖí Dje-fa-r (Djafar), ÂøΩÂÖà Hu-sien (Hussein) and Ê≤ôÁöÑ Sha-di (Saadi). The Sai- dien-ch'i of the Chinese authors is without doubt the same personage spoken of by Rashid (D'Ohsson, torn, ii, p. 467) under the name of Sayid Edjell. According to the Persian historian, he was a native of Bokhara, and governor of Karadjang (Yunnan) when Kubilai entered the country, under the reign of Mangu. Subsequently, he was appointed vizier, and in the beginning of Kubilai's reign he had charge of the finances. His son Nasruddin was appointed governor in Karadjang, and retained his position in Yunnan till his death, which Rashid, writing about A. D. 1300, says occurred five or six years before (according to the Y√ºan shi, Na-su-la ding died in 1292). Nasr-uddin's son Abubeker, who had the surname Bayan Fenchan (evidently the Boyen ch'a-r of the Y√ºan shi), was governor in Zaitun at the time Bashid wrote. He bore also his grandfather's title of Sayid Edjell, and was minister of Finance under Kubilai's successor (D'Ohsson, torn, ii, pp. 476, 507, 508). Nasr-uddin is mentioned by M. Polo, who styles him Nescradin (vol. ii, p. 66).(Original from Harvard University)(Original from Harvard University )(Original from the University of Michigan ) A Hui legend in Ningxia links four surnames common in the region - Na, Su, La, and Ding - with Nasr al-Din (Nasruddin), who \\"divided\\" their ancestor's name (Nasulading, in Chinese) among themselves.( ) The Ding family of Chendai, Fujian claims descent from him. The Ding family has branches in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Malaysia among the diaspora Chinese communities there, no longer practicing Islam but still maintaining a Hui identity. Na Zhong, a descendant of Nasr al-Din, was one of the students sent to Al-Azhar in 1931, along with Zhang Ziren, Ma Jian, and Lin Zhongming.ÁºñÂØºÔºöÈü©Áé≤ (Director: Han Ling) ÊëÑÂÉèÔºöÊùéÊñå (Photography: Li Bin) (Â§ÆËßÜÂõΩÈôÖ (CCTV international)). 2005Âπ¥02Êúà24Êó• 16:22. Besides the Han majority, the Muslim Hui also widely employed generation names, which they call lunzi paibie; for instance, in the Na family, the five most recent generations used the characters Wan, Yu, Zhang, Dian, and Hong. This practice is slowly fading since the government began keeping public records of genealogy.

The other four were the Midland Uruguay, the Central Uruguay, the Uruguay Northern, and the Uruguay East Coast Railway. The North Western of Uruguay Railway Company, Ltd. was registered In London in 1882. The North Western system consisted of of standard gauge railway, extending from Salto, the terminus of the Midland Uruguay Railway, in a general northerly direction to Palomas, Cabellos, where connections were made with the Uruguay Northern Railway, and Cuareim, opposite Barra do Quara√≠, Brazil. Salto is opposite Concordia, Argentina, an important railway center located on the Entre Rios and Argentine North Eastern Railway lines, and some traffic was interchanged. At Cuareim, an international bridge was constructed and a third rail laid for connections with the Brazil Great Southern Railway, which ran from Quarahim, Brazil, northward. The North Western operated triweekly passenger-train service in both directions between Salto and Quarahim. Connections could be made with trains for Uruguaiana, Itaquy, and other points in southern Brazil. It served stations at Salto, Las Vinas, San Antonio, Stapevi, Palomas, Arapey, Santa Ana, Isla Cabellos, Zanja Honda, Santa Rosa, and Port Cuareim. Its major bridge traverses were over the Arapey Grande River, Lake Arapey, and Jacuy. Less than a year after its founding, Railway News reported on June 16, 1883 that the company directors, in their report for the ten months during which they had held office, stated that, owing to the publication of an unfounded telegram that a revolution had broken out in Uruguay, only ¬£88,115 out of the ¬£340,000 debentures for which they asked subscriptions were placed. The directors resolved to clear off, as far as possible, the liabilities which they had taken over from the North Western Railway of Monte Video Company, to put the existing line in good working order, and to proceed with the extension as far as Isla Cabellos (a station from which a large increase of traffic was expected), and, having thus given proofs to the Uruguayan Government that the company intended faithfully to carry out their agreement with them, to ask them to grant an extension of time for completing the railway to Santa Rosa. An application was made to the Government to give the company an eighteen months extension. Regarding the works upon the existing line, the railway superintendent reported that they are in good shape, and that an entirely new station, with the necessary goods and sheds was built at the Port of Salto to take the place of the old terminus, which was inconveniently situated about inland.

A participant of World War I in the rank of lieutenant of the Austro-Hungarian Army reserve, he was a sapper and a military engineer. He was promoted to the rank of captain in the Polish Army reserve and participated in the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War. In 1935 he obtained Ph.D. at the Lviv Polytechnic. In 1938 he was appointed a deputy professor of general mechanics, and in 1940 he was appointed full professor. Shortly after the Germans seized Lviv during World War II, on the night of 4 July 1941, he was arrested by Gestapo, the German secret police, and murdered among a group of Lviv professors.  Biography   Eearly life and education  He was born on 3 January 1889 in Sanok, then within the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria; the son of Roman Vetulani, a high school professor, and Matylda n√©e Pisz (1861‚Äì1891). His mother died on 15 December 1891, when Kazimierz Vetulani was less than three years old. He was raised by his father and his second wife, El≈ºbieta n√©e Kunachowicz. He had five younger, half-siblings: brothers Zygmunt (1894‚Äì1942), Tadeusz (1897‚Äì1952) and Adam (1901‚Äì1976), and sisters Maria (master of economics, clerk of the Agricultural Bank in Krak√≥w, 1895‚Äì1945) and El≈ºbieta (1903‚Äì1921, died of tuberculosis). The family lived in Sanok, in the house at Floria≈Ñska Street (later renamed Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski Street) and in the villa of the Zaleski family at ≈öwiƒôtego Jana Square. In 1906, Roman Vetulani died of a heart attack, chanting six children, including the then-seventeen-year-old Kazimierz. The mother, El≈ºbieta Vetulani, received a pension from her deceased husband, yet she remained the only breadwinner and faced material difficulties. In 1907, Kazimierz Vetulani passed the matriculation examination with distinction at the Queen Sophia High School in Sanok. On the matriculation certificate of 15 June 1907, he had an excellent degree in mathematics and Polish language with a notion of a particular passion for those subjects. In the years 1907‚Äì1913 he studied civil engineering at the Lviv Polytechnic, but he did not obtain a diploma. During the studies, he earned his living by giving tutoring and writing theses. He also made scientific and technical travels to Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany, where he visited the construction sites of large partitions of valleys, large bridges, boulevards and river regulations.  Military service and stay in Krak√≥w  In the first half of 1914 he lectured on explosives engineering, including blowing up bridges and railroads, at the officer training courses of the Polish Rifle Squads in Vienna. During World War I he was called to serve in the Austro-Hungarian Army and infantry reserve. He was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant on 1 September 1915, and then to the rank of lieutenant on 1 November 1917. Around 1916‚Äì1918 he was assigned to the Imperial-Royal railway regiment. In the 1917/1918 academic year, he studied again at the Lviv Polytechnic. As the war ended and Poland regained independence, he was admitted to the Polish Army as a lieutenant. In 1918 he built armoured trains in Nowy SƒÖcz and Przemy≈õl and traveled to the besieged Lviv. He was promoted to the rank of captain in the corps of railway officers on 1 June 1919. After completing his military service, he settled in Krak√≥w and started work in a construction company. After the Peace of Riga of March 1921, he lectured at the Technical College of Railway Forces and at the courses of professional and reserve officers in Krak√≥w. He made contact with professors of the Jagiellonian University. In the years 1924‚Äì1939 he was a member of the Polish Mathematical Society. Thanks to the kindness of Krak√≥w's mathematicians, he could use the collections of the Mathematical Institute. In the documents of the Polish Mathematical Society, the following address of Vetulani was noted (until 1938): Krak√≥w, Smole≈Ñsk Street 14. In the 1921/1922 academic year, Kazimierz Vetulani was employed as an assistant at the Mining Academy in Krak√≥w, where he lectured in strength of materials. Then he worked as a technical advisor to a number of large companies, enterprises and central and local government institutions as well as private clients. In 1923 he was assigned as a reserve officer in the 1st Railway Regiment of the Polish Army. In 1924 he was verified on the list of railway sapper officers in the rank of captain and assigned as a reserve officer to the 1st Railway Sapper Regiment. In 1934, as a reserve captain of the engineering corps and sappers, he was included in a group of militia officers. He was assigned to the District Officers' Staff No. V and was then on the records of the Poviat Supplementary Command of the City of Krak√≥w.  Work at the Lviv Polytechnic  Kazimierz Vetulani (stands leaning against the sofa frame) at the party with his cousin Armand Vetulani (sits third from the right) in Milan√≥wek, 1930s Throughout 1920s and 1930s, Kazimierz Vetulani published a number of scientific papers. He actively participated in the scientific life, presenting the results of his research, among others, at the Second Congress of Romanian Mathematicians in Turnu-Severin on 5‚Äì9 May 1932. He obtained the academic degree of road and bridge engineer at the Faculty of Civil and Water Engineering of the Lviv Polytechnic in April 1935. In the same year, he obtained Ph.D. in technical sciences at the Lviv Polytechnic upon the dissertation On jets of liquid, supervised by Wojciech Rubinowicz. As ‚ÄúKazimierz [Vetulani] was eccentric and did not want to take the doctoral exam in front of people dumber than himself, as the anecdote says, three professors took him for a walk in the park and the result of this conversation was considered to be a passed doctoral exam‚Äù. In Lviv, Kazimierz Vetulani lived by himself at the 31 Oberty≈Ñska Street (nowadays Zarytsky Street), on the second floor. In 1937 he received a scholarship from the National Culture Fund and took a scientific trip to Germany, Belgium, England and France, ‚Äúwhere he became acquainted with the modern organization of mechanics teaching, with laboratories and with the use of mechanics in the field of railway construction, with the study of railway bridge vibrations and ground vibrations‚Äù. On 1 September 1938, he became deputy professor at the Department of General Mechanics at the Faculty of Civil and Water Engineering of the Lviv Polytechnic. He lectured in general mechanics, strength of materials and hydromechanics. At the meeting of the Commission for the filling of the Department of General Mechanics on 18 March 1938, dean Adam Kury≈Ç≈Ço stated that ‚Äúthe scientific activity of Dr. Vetulani is so serious that Dr. Vetulani deserves to be appointed a full professor, especially because of his age‚Äù. In the same year, the Lviv Polytechnic requested the Ministry of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment of Poland to present Vetulani for the nomination as full professor of general mechanics at the Faculty of Civil and Water Engineering. In June 1939, the Council of the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Lviv Polytechnic unanimously accepted the postdoctoral dissertation of Kazimierz Vetulani, Considerations in Connection with Horizontal Buckling of the Railway Track on Flat, Rigid and Rough Ground, which consisted of three papers published or written by Vetulani since 1937. His habilitation lecture General Mechanics Methods and Problems of Technical Mechanics took place on 17 June 1939. The Faculty Council applied to the Minister for approval of the application regarding the right for Kazimierz Vetulani to lecture in the field of general and technical mechanics. On 3 July 1939, Minister Wojciech ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawski approved a resolution of the Council. In the academic year 1939/1940 Kazimierz Vetulani was nominated a full professor.  Arrest and death  A few days after Germany invaded the USSR, Lviv was captured by the Wehrmacht. German authorities planned to murder members of Polish intelligentia in Lviv. In order to avoid the complications that had previously resulted in the mass arrest of professors in Krak√≥w in 1939, the Germans decided to organize the immediate shooting of professors from Lviv universities, a large number of which were active during the Soviet occupation of the city. The list of Polish professors was probably prepared by Ukrainian students from Krak√≥w associated with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). Kazimierz Vetulani, according to his cousin Janusz Vetulani, was ‚Äúrespected and liked by students of three denominations and nationalities living in Lviv at the time,‚Äù and was ‚Äúin time warned by Ukrainian students to avoid the area of his apartment for a few days and not stay in it‚Äù. However, he was to disregard this warning: ‚ÄúI was present when he visited us (as he did twice a week), mocked these warnings, bragging about his acquaintances among German scholars, and was convinced of his inviolability‚Äù. On the night of 3 July 1941, Kazimierz Vetulani was arrested by the Gestapo and shot along with a group of professors from Lviv universities at the Wuleckie Hills. The execution was carried out by the Einsatzkommando zur besonderen Verwendung (task force for special use) under the command of Brigadef√ºhrer Karl Eberhard Sch√∂ngarth. Vetulani's neighbour, Lidia Szargu≈Çowa, witnessed his arrest by the Gestapo. Gestapo men showed great interest in the assets of those arrested. Most of the legacy and personal belongings of Kazimierz Vetulani found in his apartment, including some of his writing, were looted or destroyed during his arrest. The name of Kazimierz Vetulani (written as ‚ÄúWetulani Franciszek or Kazimierz‚Äù) appeared twice in the testimony of Stefan Banach, that was submitted in 1944 to the Soviet authorities regarding the German murders of Polish scientists and intellectuals. Banach reported that to his knowledge Vetulani had been arrested on the wave of the first arrests in July 1941 and ‚Äúall hearing of him was lost. They were certainly shot [along with other professors]‚Äù. Banach added that he learned of Kazimierz Vetulani's arrest from Vetulani's cousin.  Scientific work  Kazimierz Vetulani was the author of several dozen scientific papers published, among others in the Czasopismo Techniczne (Technical Journal) and PrzeglƒÖd Techniczny (Technical Review), including over fifteen technical papers, four mathematical papers, one original lecture script and several papers on the theory of musical scales. He published works in Italian, Spanish, German and English, and was fluent in Italian. He translated into Polish, among others one work and lecture by the Italian scholar Tullio Levi-Civita. According to the authors of his biography in Wiadomo≈õci Matematyczne, Vetulani ‚Äúalso showed great understanding of technical problems by writing papers on practical engineering issues. This is evidenced, for example, by his opinion on the cause of the cracks, the receding and tilting of the wing of the parallel bridgehead on the river D≈Çubnia of the Krak√≥w-Miech√≥w railway line, and a technical opinion issued in print on the utility of the stone from Mogielnica for communication and construction purposes (...) , as well as a lecture on the foundation of the fourth bridge on the Vistula, delivered at the Technical Society in Krak√≥w‚Äù.

Route description LA 308 is the eastbank counterpart to LA 1, as it follows the east side of Bayou Lafourche. As the eastbank of Bayou Lafourche is generally less populated than the westbank, LA 308 serves as a slightly quicker route towards south central Louisiana and lower Bayou Lafourche than LA 1. Throughout its route, there are bridges that cross Bayou Lafourche to connect LA 308 to LA 1 and local communities. LA 308 is known as Bayou Road in Thibodaux and East Main Street south of Larose. The route begins in Donaldsonville at LA 3089 and is known as East Bayou Road in that community. It passes through the following communities: Belle Rose, Plattenville, Thibodaux, Raceland, Mathews, Lockport, Larose, Cut Off, and Galliano. Just north of Golden Meadow, LA 308 crosses Bayou Lafourche over a steel movable lift bridge built in 1970 and intersects at LA 1, the southern terminus.

Every aboriginal group has developed specific millet wine drinking rites. For instance, the Paiwan tribespeople will tread the ground before drinking millet wine to show their respect to the god in charge of the mountains. On the other hand, Puyuma tribespeople of Taitung County take bring fresh millet wine to the beach. Priests then chant prayers toward the direction of Orchid Island to present their gratitude for their harvest. Production Millet wine is made from millet, brewer's yeast and water. In traditional production, tools such as sieves, steamers, pots, pans and jars are used. Millet is immersed in cold water and left to rest during the night. The next morning, the millet is washed with care so as not to squeeze it. The common proportion is about 400 cc per pound of millet. The washed millet is steamed and then mixed with brewer's yeast and cold water which was boiled beforehand. Finally, the mix is put into a container and the opening is sealed.

Plot  The film opens in a recording studio, where singer Billy \\"Eye\\" Harper (Tray Loren) is in a session working on a few tracks with his band and his girlfriend Lynn Starling (Donna Scoggins), also a back up singer. After he finishes the recording, Billy and the rest of the band leave. Despite trying to record her own vocal tracks, Lynn is left to go to the jacuzzi upstairs, after refusing Kevin (Kevin Eddy) the recording engineer's offer to join her. Meanwhile, Billy returns to the studio, where he finds only Kevin and Mary (Mary Well), Kevin's assistant. In an enigmatic move, Billy kills Kevin by slitting his throat and impales Mary on a wall-mounted coat peg. When Lynn returns, she finds Billy smoking some drugs at the recording studio's control panel. Lynn is unaware that Billy has just killed both Kevin and Mary while she was gone. Once Lynn finds out, she is saved by some security guards. After a brief intermission, it is two years later, where it is revealed that Billy was captured, tried and executed. It is now the \\"Rocktober Blood Tour Press Party\\", and Lynn and the remaining band members are touring as \\"Headmistress\\". A VJ who interviews Lynn, asks several questions about the band's tour, as well as Billy's fall from grace, to which Lynn responds by stating that identifying Billy was \\"the hardest thing she ever had to do.\\" A mysterious figure then appears in a Halloween \\"death\\" mask, and tells Lynn to meet with Chris (Nigel Benjamin), the band's manager, in the office. When she arrives in the office, she is cornered by Billy, in the same death mask, who leaves her curled up, and crying on the floor. After that, Billy persistently stalks Lynn, killing people involved with her along the way, but hiding their bodies, to make others think she is crazy by claiming that Billy is after her. Eventually Honey (Cana Cockrell) convinces Lynn to dig up Billy's grave. They find out that Billy is dead, and Lynn assumes that she is hallucinating. The next night, Lynn and the band are getting ready for the show, when Billy reappears and tells Lynn that he is really Billy's twin brother, John Harper, and that she identified the wrong man. John tells Lynn that the people he killed valued Billy more than him, even though he wrote the renowned songs himself. Then John chloroforms Lynn, and the show begins. A prop coffin pops up on the stage, and Lynn is revealed inside. John tells her that his plan is to kill her as the show's grand finale.

As a rare piece of officially licensed Calvin and Hobbes merchandise, it is a highly valued collectible. Content Written by a speech-language pathologist and a learning disabilities educator, Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes is a language textbook for elementary and intermediate-level students. Jan Roebken created the cover and additional interior illustrations. The book reprints fifty-seven Calvin and Hobbes comic strips, organized into five lesson units. Each unit begins with a series of comic strips that form a story. The five units are: # \\"The Binoculars\\" ‚Äì Calvin breaks his father's binoculars and solicits Hobbes' advice. # \\"The Find\\" ‚Äì Calvin discovers and assembles a dinosaur skeleton, of sorts. Hobbes renders a drawing of the creature. # \\"The Christmas Story\\" ‚Äì As Calvin struggles to be good in anticipation of Santa's arrival, he and Hobbes discuss the philosophy of law and the nature of belief. # \\"The Bug Collection\\" ‚Äì Calvin forgets to do his homework, and rushes to complete it on the way to school.

Owing to Bill Watterson's principled refusal to license his comic strip for merchandise in general, Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes is an exceptional item; a license was granted to the authors after they personally communicated to Watterson the success they had using his comic strip to teach children with learning disabilities. Published in a limited print run in Fargo, North Dakota, Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes is a very rare and highly sought-after book. In the 2010 revised edition of his book Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip, Nevin Martell says that only after a long search did he obtain a copy of Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes, that copies of the book sell for very high prices, and that the book is \\"perhaps the most difficult piece of official Calvin and Hobbes memorabilia to find.\\" The book price comparison website Dualj.com, which tracked sale prices of books, recorded that a copy of Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes sold for US$10,000 in 2009.

It previously held the status of a village until December 31, 1973. The hamlet is located east of the Town of Assiniboia on highway 13. Demographics Prior to December 31, 1973, Horizon was incorporated as a village, and was restructured as a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Bengough on that date.  History The hamlet of Horizon was formed in 1912 with the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1917, with a population of 57, an application was made to make the community a village. The story is told that before the railroad went through the district two surveying parties were working in that vicinity, one for the Grand Trunk Pacific and the other for the Canadian Pacific Railway. At the spot where Horizon now stands these two parties came together. An argument followed. One of the surveyors made the remark \\"It looks as if we have come to the horizon\\". Out of this argument came the name for the village, later erected on that spot.  Business  The very first business was a general store and post office, owned by Herbert Stanbridge in a building moved in from Moreland, Saskatchewan. This was quickly followed by a grocery store, a clothing store, a restaurant (the \\"Horizon Cafe\\",) a boarding house, a lumberyard, a hardware store, a pool room & barbershop, a blacksmith, a livery barn, a farm implement dealer, a photo studio, a liquor store and a mechanic, among many others. Today, there are no businesses in Horizon.  Community organizations  The village had organized a very active Red Cross branch. Every year an annual school field day was held with twelve schools participating. The village had an active tennis club with about 25 members. In addition, the following community organizations existed in Horizon over the years: Horizon School No. 3129 was established in 1912 after an application was made to the Department of Education to form a school division to service the 26 school age children who lived within a five-mile radius of Horizon. Eventually, a high school became necessary. and so an addition was built onto the school, creating a two-room school for grades 1-10. As time went on, fewer and fewer students attended the school. At first one room was closed, then the other in 1966. Students were bused to Bengough and the school was eventually sold and relocated out of the community. Horizon 4H Calf Club was established in 1945 by Charlie Ribey. Children from several surrounding school districts were members. An annual event called Achievement Days was held where participants showed off their horse racing and jumping skills. The club continued until 1950. Horizon 4H Grain Club was established in 1938 by Jack Johnston and became a Beef Club around 1945. Horizon, Saskatchewan Elevator Horizon Homemakers' Club Recreation Association Horizon Ball Club Horizon Poultry Pool Horizon Wheat Pool Committee was formed in 1942. St. Cunegunda Church was a Catholic church built in 1928 (closed in 1991) followed by a rectory in 1929. Prior to that, service was held in the home of several parishioners and later in a hall built in 1915. The first priest was Father Mollard who drove from Weyburn by horse and buggy until the railway came to Horizon. The St. Cunegunda Roman Catholic Cemetery was established in 1914 abutting the Horizon Protestant Cemetery which itself was established in 1928. The former church is now called the Horizon Community Church Centre. Altar Society was formed in 1928 but was later dissolved and the Viceroy - Horizon Catholic Women's League took its place. Horizon, Saskatchewan Church  Transportation  In homesteading days, the Yellowgrass Trail ran through Horizon, taking horse and wagon traffic further west. Today, the community sits beside Highway 13, also called the Redcoat Trail and the Ghost Town Trail. Horizon is also serviced by a former Canadian Pacific Railway branch. That rail line first came through in 1912. The first train station in Horizon was made out of a rail box car before a dedicated building was moved in from Forward, Saskatchewan. The CPR also built water tanks for the steam locomotives that were supplied with water from springs and wells dug south of the community. In 1996 the CPR line was abandoned. Three years later, a group of local farmers formed the Red Coat Road and Rail and purchased part of the branch line and a number of elevators, consisting of about 115 km of track between Pangman and Assiniboia. Since then, the Great Western Railway has been contracted to operate the line on behalf of the Red Coat Road & Rail. Originally, there were three grain elevators in Horizon; North Star, Ogilvie Flour Mill and the Federal Grain Company (built in 1922). Today, only two grain elevators remain. A former Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (built in 1953) elevator and the original Federal grain elevator still stand. The Federal elevator has been recognized as a municipal heritage property. The elevator was purchased by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in 1972 who operated it until 1996 when the CPR branch line was abandoned. The elevator was later bought by the Red Coat Road and Rail in 1999. Horizon, Saskatchewan from Channel Lake Today, a tourist railway, the Southern Prairie Railway, operates along the line and tours of the elevator in Horizon are available.  Natural disasters  Over the years, Horizon was the site of several natural disasters, including: * A large prairie fire in 1915 * A tornado in 1949 * The Great Depression from 1929-1939 * A devastating army worm infestation in 1937  Popular culture  Horizon, Saskatchewan Cemetery The novel A Garden in the Wind (1975) by Gabrielle Roy and the film based on it, Where Will You Go Sam Lee Wong?, are set in the town. The Sinclair Ross novel As for Me and My House (1941) is also set in the town.

It is adjacent to Ontario Highway 50 (Peel Regional Road 50) and was formed by the damming of the main branch of the Humber River, originally to create a mill pond. Each winter, the surface of the pond is transformed into a community skating rink available for recreational use (commonly referred to as the Palgrave Pond). The rinks are created by local volunteer, Ken Hunt (aka the ‚ÄúIce Angel‚Äù), and have appeared on the Mill Pond each winter since December 2000. Hydrology The pond is on the main upper branch of the Humber river and is impounded by a modern concrete weir. The primary inflow, at the northwest, and outflow, at the southwest, is the Humber River, and the lake has a maximum depth of and an average depth of . Natural history There is a fishway with a viewing window at the dam to allow fish to bypass the structure. Twelve species of fish, for example the White Sucker, Brown bullhead and Golden shiner, have been found in the pond. Economy Recreation The ice rinks on the Mill Pond are created in late fall or early winter ‚Äì as soon as the pond freezes deeply enough to support human traffic ‚Äì and are maintained throughout the winter and into the early spring, for as long as the ice retains a safe thickness. The rinks are seldom left unused and on the weekends the mill pond is transformed into a postcard image of Canada when the rinks fill with families out to enjoy a leisurely skate or game of pond hockey. The site usually offers several hockey rinks of varying sizes as well as a recreational skating loop. Facilities at the rinks include washrooms, benches for seating, and miscellaneous hockey equipment for hockey players to use. As the rinks are not maintained by local authorities, facilities are made available through funds raised by local organisations such as the Palgrave Rotary Club and through donations by families using the rinks. The rinks are generally used for recreational skating and casual hockey games, but they also play host to winter parties and events. Pondfest was a 2007 Winter festival hosted by the Ontario ATV Search and Rescue Federation and supported by the Palgrave Rotary Club. In 2012 the venue will host the inaugural Kinsmen Canadian Pond Hockey Championship. Although generally used by locals looking for some winter exercise, the picturesque and well- maintained rinks attract skaters from outside of the community, sometimes from as far off as Toronto. The popular rinks were even featured in the Toronto Star. As the rinks are not maintained by local authorities, users skate on the rinks at their own risk. If the ice thickness level has been checked and deemed too thin for safe use, signs will be posted warning skaters off the rinks; however, these signs will appear only if ice thickness has been recently checked and so skaters must take all standard precautions when entering the ice surface. =The Ice Angel= The rinks on the Mill Pond are created and maintained by a Palgrave local, Ken Hunt, who is known as the ‚ÄúIce Angel‚Äù. Hunt began clearing the rinks with his teenage children after searching unsuccessfully for another local public rink where they could skate and play hockey. Local residents soon noticed the new ice rink and flocked out to make use of it. Hunt then began expanding the skating area of the central hockey rink and built a loop around it where recreational skaters could skate without hockey players and skaters getting in the way of one another.

Simon & Schuster) Van Loon's Lives is a book by the Dutch-American writer Hendrik Willem van Loon published in 1942. Its full title, deliberately written in a manner already archaic at the time of writing, is Van Loon's Lives: Being a true and faithful account of a number of highly interesting meetings with certain historical personages, from Confucius and Plato to Voltaire and Thomas Jefferson, about whom we had always felt a great deal of curiosity and who came to us as dinner guests in a bygone year.Simon and Schuster, 1942. Loosely based on the classical Plutarch's Lives, it recounts the biographies of various famous historical characters, and like Plutarch often pairing together characters from different times and places whose life, careers or personalities seemed to Van Loon to bear a similarity to each other (e.g. William the Silent and George Washington who led the Wars of Independence of their respective countries; the philosophers Descartes and Emerson; Empress Theodora of Byzantium and Queen Elizabeth I of England; Torquemada and Robespierre, of both of whom Van Loon had less than a flattering view...). In the book the author imagines he is living in his summer home in the town of Veere on the island of Walcheren in the Dutch province of Zealand. He has the ability to summon the famous (and sometimes infamous) great men and women of history to come to dinner. The summoning is done in the prosaic way of leaving under a specific stone a note with the names of the persons they wish to meet that weekend, who duly make their appearance. This magical aspect places the book within the category of contemporary fantasy, though the term did not yet exist at the time it was published. Chapters in the book typically start with Van Loon describing the lives of the people invited that week, with many digressions and idiosyncratic comments, opinions and comparisons with actual 20th century events - particularly with the doings of Hitler and Nazi Germany in general and the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in particular, which was clearly very much on Van Loon's mind. This is followed by these people appearing in the 1930s provincial Netherlands and their interaction with modern people, in some cases consisting of polite and intellectually stimulating conversations, in other cases leading to humorous or hilarious results. (For example, the Archbishop of Bithynia and Archbishop of Cyrenaica, who were staunch theological foes during the 4th century Council of Nicea, wildly assault each other as soon as they are resurrected in the 20th century and run out into the streets of Veere, shouting abuse. A local policeman locks them up in separate cells, but by the next morning they had mysteriously disappeared...) The book was written at the time when Veere, like the rest of the Netherlands, lay under Nazi occupation. Despite its light-hearted tone, the book clearly indicates the longing of the writer for his homeland whose liberation he was doomed never to see, having died in 1944. This is especially indicated in the book's dedication to the exiled Queen Juliana. Also, the book's plot is set in the late 1930s with the clouds of impending war clearly visible, and in its end the protagonists must flee the German invasion, bringing to an end their meetings with the people from the past.

They present resources, activities and interactions within a course structure and provide for the different stages of assessment. VLEs also usually report on participation; and have some level of integration with other institutional systems. For teachers and instructors who edit them, VLEs may have a de facto role as authoring and design environments. VLEs have been adopted by almost all higher education institutions in the English- speaking world. Components The following are the main components required for the best virtual learning environment or online education curriculum to take place. VLE learning platforms commonly allow: *Content management ‚Äì creation, storage, access to and use of learning resources *Curriculum mapping and planning ‚Äì lesson planning, assessment and personalisation of the learning experience *Learner engagement and administration ‚Äì managed access to learner information and resources and tracking of progress and achievement *Communication and collaboration ‚Äì emails, notices, chat, wikis, blogs *Real time communication ‚Äì live video conferencing or audio conferencing A VLE may include some or all of the following elements: * The course syllabus * Administrative information about the course: prerequisites, credits, registration, payments, physical sessions, and contact information for the instructor. * A notice board for current information about the ongoing course * The basic content of some or all of the course; the complete course for distance learning applications, or some part of it, when used as a portion of a conventional course. This normally includes material such as copies of lecture in the form of text, audio, or video presentations, and the supporting visual presentations * Additional resources, either integrated or as links to outside resources. This typically consists of supplementary reading, or innovative equivalents for it. * Self-assessment quizzes or analogous devices, normally scored automatically * Formal assessment functions, such as examinations, essay submission, or presentation of projects. This now frequently includes components to support peer assessment * Support for communications, including e-mail, threaded discussions, chat rooms, Twitter and other media, sometimes with the instructor or an assistant acting as moderator. Additional elements include wikis, blogs, RSS and 3D virtual learning spaces. * Links to outside sources ‚Äì pathways to all other online learning spaces are linked via the VLE (Virtual Learning Environment). * Management of access rights for instructors, their assistants, course support staff, and students * Documentation and statistics as required for institutional administration and quality control * Authoring tools for creating the necessary documents by the instructor, and, usually, submissions by the students * Provision for the necessary hyperlinks to create a unified presentation to the students. * Interactive online whiteboard for live virtual classes A VLE is normally not designed for a specific course or subject, but is capable of supporting multiple courses over the full range of the academic program, giving a consistent interface within the institution and‚Äîto some degree‚Äîwith other institutions using the system. The virtual learning environment supports the worldwide exchange of information between a user and the learning institute he or she is currently enrolled in through digital mediums like e-mail, chat rooms, web 2.0 sites or a forum. Student accessibility features One of the processes to enhance the learning experience was the virtual resource room, which is student-centered, works in a self-paced format, and which encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning. In virtual mode, the materials are available in the form of computer-aided learning programs, lecture notes, special self-assessment modules. Another mechanism for the student to student interactions in a form of simple discussion forum is by using a novel link cyber tutor. This allows the students with an email account to connect with course content and the staff with their doubts and related questions. The students are able to contact the staff without a face to face visit which saves the on-campus time. The staff remains anonymous which allows for the several staff to act as a cyber tutor during the course. The student does not remain anonymous, although their email address is cryptic enough to mask their identity. Students can discuss the exams, lab reports, posters, lectures, technical help with downloading materials. The evaluation of the use of a Virtual resource room is done by surveys, focus groups, and online feedback forms. The students have 24 hours of access to the learning material in a day which suits their lifestyles. Similar terms Computerized learning systems have been referred to as electronic educational technology, e-learning, learning platform or learning management system. The major difference is that VLE and LMS are applications, whereas the Learning Platform shares characteristics with an Operating System where different educational web-based applications can be run on the platform. The terms virtual learning environment (VLE) and learning platform are generically used to describe a range of integrated web-based applications that provide teachers, learners, parents and others involved in education with information, tools, and resources to support and enhance educational delivery and management. These terms are broadly synonymous with 'managed learning environments' (MLEs) and 'managed virtual learning environments' (MVLEs). The applications that form part of these online services can include web pages, email, message boards, and discussion forums, text and video conferencing, shared diaries, online social areas, as well as assessment, management, and tracking tools. The term learning platform refers to a range of tools and services often described using terms such as educational extranet, VLE, LMS, ILMS and LCMS providing learning and content management. The term learning platform also includes the personal learning environment (PLE) or personal online learning space (POLS), including tools and systems that allow the development and management of portfolios. The specific functionality associated with any implementation of a learning platform will vary depending upon the needs of the users and can be achieved by bringing together a range of features from different software solutions either commercially available, open source, self-built or available as free to use web services. These tools are delivered together via a cohesive user environment with a single entry point, through integration achieved by technical standards. * a learning management system (LMS). Related concepts include content management system (CMS), which properly refers to the organization of the educational or other content, not the overall environment; learning content management system (LCMS), which is more often used for corporate training systems than for systems in education institutions; managed learning environment (MLE), which normally refers to the overall infrastructure in an institution of which the VLE is a component, learning support system (LSS); online learning center (OLC); or learning platform (LP), education via computer-mediated communication (CMC); or online education. The term \\"virtual learning environment\\" is more commonly used in Europe and Asia, while the synonymous term \\"learning management system\\" is the more common usage in North America. The term LMS can also mean a \\"library management system\\" (which is now more commonly referred to as integrated library system, or ILS). Justification Middle School and High School use VLEs in order to: * Increase academic performance in order to meet standards to graduate. * Address the diverse learning needs of all students with the digital curriculum. * Personalize learning to better meet the needs of all students including underachieving and accelerated learners. * Equip administrators, teachers, and students with real-time progress and performance to make informed decisions to track success.* Institutions of higher and further education use VLEs in order to: * Economize on the time of teaching staff, and the cost of instruction. * Facilitate the presentation of online learning by instructors without web authoring experience. * Provide instruction to students in a flexible manner to students with varying time and location constraints. * Provide instruction in a manner familiar to the current web- oriented generation of students. * Facilitate the networking of instruction between different campuses or even colleges. * Provide for the reuse of common material among different courses. * Provide automatic integration of the results of student learning into campus information systems. * Provide the ability to deliver various courses to a large number of students. Online learners performed modestly better, on average than those learning the same material through traditional face-to-face instruction.  Controversy  VLEs are supposed to support many 21st century skills, including: * Cultural and global awareness: Students have access to a wide network of people and information. * Self-direction: Students are able to work at their own pace. * Information and communication technology literacy: Students use technology to obtain and present information. * Problem solving skills: Students are required to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in order to be assessed, and they often participate in group thinking and discussion. * Time management: Students are required to meet deadlines. Both supporters and critics of virtual learning environments recognize the importance of the development of such skills, including creativity, communication, and knowledge application; however, the controversy lies in whether or not virtual learning environments are practical for both teachers and students. Critics of VLE worry about the disconnect that can occur between the teacher and students, as well as between student to student. A Virtual Learning Environment does not provide students with face-to-face interaction and therefore, can deprive students of opportunities for better communication and deeper understanding. Educators also have concerns pertaining to a student's computer literacy skills and access to quality technology. Both can create a challenge for students to succeed in a Virtual Learning Environment. A study among Indian students has suggested that a negative experience with virtual learning environments can leave \\"the learner with a passive, un-engaging experience, leading to incomplete learning and low performance\\". The VLE leads to a reported higher computer self-efficacy, while participants report being less satisfied with the learning process that is achieved in the Virtual Learning Environment. Standards Most VLEs support the Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) as a standard, but there are no commonly used standards that define how the learner's performance within a course can be transferred from one VLE to another. There are also standards for sharing content such as those defined by the IMS Global Consortium. Local bodies such as in the school's sector in the UK the DCSF via Becta have additionally defined a learning platform \\"conformance framework\\" to encourage interoperability. Virtual learning environments are not limited only to students and learners in university-level studies. There are many virtual learning environments for students in grades K-12. These systems are also particularly suited for the needs of independent educational programs, charter schools, and home-based education. As virtual teaching and learning become more deeply integrated into curricula, it is important to assess the quality and rigor of virtual programs. The Virtual Learning Program Standards provide a framework for identifying key areas for effective teaching and learning in Virtual Learning Programs throughout the Northeast and the nation.Davis, C. (April 2014). Virtual Learning Rubric. Retrieved from http://www.doe.mass.edu/odl/standards/VLPrubric.pdf  Assessments  Educators need benchmark tools to assess a virtual learning environment as a viable means of education. Walker developed a survey instrument known as the Distance Education Learning Environment Survey (DELES), which is accessible to students anywhere.. DELES examines instructor support, student interaction, and collaboration, personal relevance, authentic learning, active learning, and student autonomy.

Portrait of Peter the Great by Marie-Anne Collot. 1768‚Äî1770. A study for the Bronze Horseman in Saint Petersburg. Marie- Anne Collot (1748 - 24 February 1821) was a French sculptor. She was the student and daughter-in-law of Etienne Falconet and is most well known as a portraitist, close to the philosophic and artistic circles of Diderot and Catherine the Great. Falconet's student Marie-Anne Collot was born in Paris and started to work as a model at the age of 15 in the workshop of Jean- Baptiste II Lemoyne.M.L. Becker, Marie-Anne Collot, L'art de la terre-cuite au f√©minin, L'Objet d'Art, June 1998 He had a determining influence on her career as a portraitist. She then entered Etienne Falconet's workshop, who was a close friend of Diderot. She became Falconet's pupil and faithful friend. Her younger brother became an apprentice at the publisher's Andr√© Le Breton, who was one of the four publishers of Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclop√©die. Early sculptures Her first works consisted of terracotta busts of Falconet's friends including Diderot, the actor Pr√©ville in the role of Sganarelle in ‚ÄúLe m√©decin malgr√© lui‚Äù by Moli√®re, and Prince Dimitri Alexeievich Galitzine, Russian ambassador. Many other works are now lost. From then on everyone recognised her talent, sincerity and lively spirit.  The Russian years 1766-1778 and Peter the Great's head  In October 1766 Marie- Anne Collot accompanied her mentor, Etienne-Maurice Falconet, to St. Petersburg, when he was invited by Catherine the Great with a view to creating an equestrian statue of Peter the Great called ‚ÄúThe Bronze Horseman‚Äù. During this time she sculpted the portraits of members of the Russian Court. They marvelled at the talent of this young woman sculptor, they could remember none other, and she was only 18 years old. Marie-Anne also created the plaster model that was selected for the Peter the Great's head for the statue, after Catherine had rejected three attempts by Falconet. In December of the same year she presented her work to the Imperial Academy of Arts, of which she was elected a member on 20 January 1767. She received a comfortable pension, which to her represented a fortune. Marble busts Collot sculpted a bust representing Falconet at Catherine the Great's request. This is now in the Museum of Fine Art in Nancy, France. She also requested a bust of Diderot in 1772. When Falconet saw its quality it is said that he destroyed the one he had made himself of Diderot. The bust is in the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Then followed busts of Henry IV of France, Sully, Voltaire, and possibly one of D'Alembert (now lost?). Also several of the Empress herself, the Grand Duke Paul I and his wife the Grand Duchess Natalia, as well as marble medallions of historical characters and people associated with the Russian court; Peter the Great, the Empress Elizabeth, and Lady Cathcart, the wife of Lord Cathcart, British Ambassador to Russia. She also made a superb bust of their daughter Mary. It was said that there started to be a shortage of marble in St. Petersburg. Marriage and the return to France In 1777 Marie-Anne Collot married the painter Pierre-Etienne Falconet in St. Petersburg. He was the son of Etienne Falconet. A daughter was born of the union a year later. The marriage was however unhappy and short-lived. Madame Falconet returned to France in 1778 with her baby. The stay in Holland In 1782 Collot went to Holland at the invitation of her friend, Princess Galitzine. While there, she sculpted the marble busts of William, Prince of Orange, and of his wife, Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia. An early retirement Collot gave up sculpting completely, concentrating from then on her daughter's education and helping her father-in-law who had fallen gravely ill. She continued to do so until his death in 1791. The French Revolution completely upset the world of artists, writers and philosophers. With her master, her husband and her friends having died, in 1791 Madame Falconet bought a country estate at Marimont, near the village of Bourdonnay in Moselle, France.

He wrote down his story in his later years, but never seriously sought publication due to a combination of disapproval from family members and fear of his story being exploited by dime novelists. The book covers Garcia's time in Montana from 1878 through 1879. Garcia served as a herder and packer for the U.S. Army in Montana in the Yellowstone and Musselshell country, working for Colonel Samuel D. Sturgis' \\"Boys in Blue\\" out of Fort Ellis from 1876-1878. He was present during the Nez Perce War. The book begins in 1878, when Garcia left his job with the army to go into business with a man named Beaver Tom, trapping beaver and trading for buffalo robes. While trading with members of the Pend d'Oreilles tribe, Garcia met and married a Nez Perce woman known among the Pend d'Oreille as In-who-lise ('Broken Tooth'; her original name, Kot-kot-hy-hih, means White Feather), who had been with Chief Joseph's tribe when they ran from the U.S. Cavalry. The book includes Garcia's reproduction of her firsthand account of the final engagement with 7th Infantry at the Battle of the Big Hole. The manuscript In 1928, Andrew Garcia met historian L.V. McWhorter, who was researching the Nez Perce Indians. Garcia offered to provide information about the Nez Perce War of 1877 he had learned from his first wife, a Nez Perce woman called In-who-lise; McWhorter accepted the offer and the pair of them continued to correspond by letter until Garcia's death in 1943. Garcia continued to write throughout that time; his manuscripts include much of his life story from the 1860s through the 1880s. Garcia worked on his manuscript late at night after working on his ranch all day. The manuscript which Garcia wrote was several thousand pages long, and he declared to McWhorter that his intention was to produce a three- volume work titled In-who-lise. When Ben Stein obtained the manuscripts, they had been packed away in dynamite boxes for safekeeping. According to one of Andrew Garcia's great-grandsons, Doug Garcia, the manuscript telling his story was not welcomed by many members of the family. Andrew Garcia's wife did not want to know about the women who had come before her, and one of his daughters-in-law, Evelyn Gladys Garcia, strongly objected to the coarse nature of the story; furthermore, Andrew's grandsons were punished for trying to sneak and read it. In 1960, the family sold the papers to Bennett H. Stein, who ultimately edited portions of some of them to create Tough Trip through Paradise 1878-1879, which was published in 1967. The manuscript remained in the possession of the Rock Foundation (founded by Bennett Stein and Hugh Galusha to keep the papers safe); after Stein's death, Dorothy Bradley (then the head of the Rock Foundation) made the decision to house the manuscripts at the Park County Museum. The foundation retained ownership of the materials, which were subsequently moved again in 2004, this time to the Montana Historical Society. The Rock Foundation was subsequently dissolved, at which time ownership of the Ben Stein research collection (including Andrew Garcia's manuscripts; materials and drafts used in Ben Stein's writing process; and correspondence and miscellaneous manuscript materials belonging to both men) passed to the Montana Historical Society. As of November 2012, the collection is open to use by researchers.

The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Gladioconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is obconic to turbinate in shape, with broad shoulders. The protoconch is multispiral, and the whorls have nodules which may persist or become obsolete. The body whorl is typically ornamented with ridges. The anal notch is fairly deep, except in smaller specimens. The color patterns include brown or red banded shells, and rarely mostly white shells. The periostracum is tufted, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior sections of the radular tooth is longer than or similar in length to the posterior section. The blade is long, and is more than half as long as the anterior section of the tooth. A basal spur is present, the barb is short, and there is an internal terminating cusp. The radular tooth has coarse serrations. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the West Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions, and one species is endemic to the Marquesas Islands. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on polychaete worms.

Education Hodgkin was educated at the University of Oxford where he graduated in 1971. He was awarded a PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1974 for research on the genetics of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Career and research Hodgkin was a scientist at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Hodgkin was one of the earliest researchers to explore the genetics of development in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. He first unraveled the genetic and maturational events in worm sex determination before extending his interest to other developmental pathways, behaviour and immunity. Most Caenorhabditis elegans worms are self- fertilizing hermaphrodites, with two X chromosomes, but X0 males can also arise spontaneously, permitting genetic crosses. Hodgkin used genetic mutations in this tiny, fast-breeding species to define the regulatory cascade of genes that controls the development of male or hermaphrodite characteristics ‚Äî providing a model for approaching development in other species. Since 2000, Hodgkin has focused on the nematode's response to attack by bacteria, exploring highly conserved pathways of innate immunity that are also relevant to development. Through microarray analysis, he has identified antibacterial factors produced by the worm that could be candidates for new antibiotics. He has also discovered novel pathogenic bacteria that attack nematodes, which may have potential as biological pest control agents against parasitic nematodes. Awards and honours Hodgkin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1990.

Despite his solid dead-heat third in the Caulfield Cup and a fifth placing in the Mackinnon Stakes he was sent out by punters a 25/1 chance in the Cup.

After a lengthy break from racing due to injury, Baghdad Note was leased by young trainer Terry Millard at Kilmore, who gradually returned the horse to race fitness. A stirring win at Sandown in 1973 was Baghdad Note's first metropolitan success since the Melbourne Cup. He also won the Sandown Cup soon afterwards. The horse featured in the 1973 Adelaide Cup, running second to Tavel, and then went to Queensland where he won the O'Shea stakes.

Johnson's Democrats lost forty-seven seats to the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. The Democrats also lost three seats in the U.S. Senate to the Republicans. Despite their losses, the Democrats retained control of both chambers of Congress. Republicans won a large victory in the gubernatorial elections, with a net gain of seven seats. This was the first election held after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which led to a surge in African-American voter participation. The Republican Party had risked sliding into irrelevance after the disastrous 1964 elections, and the GOP's victory in this election invigorated the party, strengthening the conservative coalition. The GOP made inroads into the South and among blue collar workers, foreshadowing Nixon's Southern strategy and the rise of Reagan Democrats, respectively. Among the newly elected Republicans were future presidents Ronald Reagan (who soon became the leader of the right- wing of the Republican Party) as Governor of California and George H. W. Bush as a representative from Texas, and future vice president Spiro Agnew as Governor of Maryland. The election also helped establish former vice president Richard Nixon (who campaigned heavily for Republicans) as a front-runner for the 1968 Republican nomination.

Bidentalia was one of the first names used to describe dicynodonts; the group was established in 1876, while the name \\"bidentals\\" dates back as far as 1845. With the increasing prominence of phylogenetics, the group was redefined as a clade in 2009. Bidentalia is now considered a stem-based taxon that includes all taxa more closely related to Aulacephalodon bainii and Dicynodon lacerticeps than Emydops arctatus. History In 1845, South African geologist Andrew Geddes Bain described the first known dicynodonts as \\"bidentals\\" for their two prominent tusks. \\"Bidental\\" was the first name ever used for a group of non- mammalian synapsids. The name Dicynodontia, which is more commonly used to refer to these animals, was erected by English paleontologist Richard Owen in 1860. Realizing that Bain's \\"bidentals\\" predated his \\"dicynodonts\\", Owen named Bidentalia in 1876 as a replacement name for Dicynodontia. Owen described Bidentalia as reptiles with \\"a long ever-growing tusk in each maxillary; premaxillaries connate, forming with the lower jaw a beak-shaped mouth, probably sheathed with horn. Sacrum of more than two vertebrae; trunk- vertebrae amphicoelian; limbs ambulatory.\\" At this time, Bidentalia included three main species: Dicynodon lacerticeps, Dicynodon bainii, and Ptychognathus declivis. The two Dicynodon species were named in 1845, just before Bain described his bidentals. Ptychognathus was named in 1859, and is now called Lystrosaurus. In the following years Dicynodontia became the preferred name for these reptiles and Bidentalia quickly fell out of use. Bidentalia was reinstated as a clade in 2009. It was used to include all therochelonians more closely related to Dicynodon than to emydopoids (a group of more basal dicynodonts). As a clade, Bidentalia forms a more inclusive group than it did under Owen's use. Owen's Bidentalia was equivalent to Dicynodontia, which today is used as a much larger group encompassing all dicynodonts. In its current use, Bidentalia includes two major subgroups, Cryptodontia and Dicynodontoidea. Evolution Bidentalia originated in the Guadalupian epoch of the Permian and quickly spread worldwide, with early species known from both Brazil and Russia. However, they were conspicuously absent from Africa despite its well-known Permian fauna until the late Permian. The oldest and most basal known bidentalian is Rastodon. Phylogeny Bidentalia is divided into two major groups, the Cryptodontia and the Dicynodontoidea, as well as a small number of basal genera such as Elph and Rastodon However, the Cryptodontia may be paraphyletic.

Silali is south of the Suguta Valley, which reaches northward to Lake Turkana, and is about north of Lake Baringo. Geology Mount Silali is part of a group of volcanoes, the others being Paka and Korosi, in the Loyamoruk Plains of the eastern Nginyang Division of Baringo County. Silali is a recent volcano that became active from 400,000 to 220,000 years ago, and was still active 7,000 years ago. It is the largest caldera volcano in the Gregory Rift Valley. Its pre-caldera development began with mainly peralkaline trachyte lavas and pyroclasts, succeeded by mildly alkaline to transitional basalts. The basalts of the mountain are similar in composition to oceanic island basalts, but have a range of isotopes indicating a variety of origins. The Kenya rift is oriented north-south, and in the past the minimum horizontal tectonic stress direction was east-west, the direction of extension. The alignment of rows of recently formed small vents, cones, domes and collapse pits in the Silali region indicates that the minimum horizontal stress direction has changed to NW-SE within the last half million years. Environment Mean annual temperature in the Loyamoruk Plains is , rising to in the hot season. Rainfall averages , with wide variations. The thorn-bush savannah plain has no permanent source of water, with the Nginyang River flowing only after rains. There are some highland pastures on Mount Silali with perennial grasses. From oral accounts, the environment has become significantly drier in the last few decades, and with less grass and fewer types of grass. Energy potential The mountain is potentially a source of geothermal energy. There are hot springs at Kapedo to the west with temperatures of to . The eastern part has many fumaroles and hot and altered grounds with temperatures that range from to . In September 2011 the Geothermal Development Company (GDC) of Kenya said that 19 companies had submitted bids to develop geothermal power plants at Lake Bogoria and at Silali. GDC intended to choose eight companies, each to build one 100 MW power plant. They expected the plants to start coming on line in 2017.

The history of signboards: from the earliest times to the present day (1866) p. 474. Nicholas Ling (fl.1570‚Äì1607) was a London publisher, bookseller, and editor who published several important Elizabethan works, including the first and second quartos of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Ling was the son of John Lynge, a parchment maker from Norwich. He was apprenticed to Henry Bitteman in 1570 and was admitted to the Stationers' Company as a \\"freeman\\" (full member) in 1578.Notes & Queries 6th Series, V. VI (Nov. 11, 1882) p. 395.Campbell, O.J. ed. \\"Nicholas Ling\\" in Reader's Encyclopedia of Shakespeare (1966) p. 462. He generally partnered with other publishers. In 1597 he edited Politeuphuia, or Wits Commonwealth, a collection of prose quotations. He has also been credited by some critics with editing England's Helicon (1600), a collection of Elizabethan lyric poems.Hebel, J, Williams. \\"Nicholas Ling and England's Helicon\\" in Library (1924) s4-V (2): 153-160. In 1603 he collaborated with another bookseller, John Trundell, to publish the first quarto of Hamlet. This edition, printed by Valentine Simmes, has been widely condemned as a wildly inaccurate and badly printed travesty of the play.Hibbard, G. R. (ed), Hamlet, Oxford University Press, 1998, p.69-75. A few months later James Roberts printed the much more substantial and accurate second quarto according to the \\"true and perfect copy\\" of Shakespeare's manuscript.MacCary, W. Thomas, Hamlet: A Guide to the Play, Greenwood Press, 1998, p.12. Gerald D. Johnson suggests that Trundell had acquired a garbled version of the text, which was quickly published in association with Ling to meet demand. Roberts had been given official access to Shakespeare's manuscript by the company, as he had entered it as a forthcoming publication in the Stationers' Register in 1602. He made a deal with Ling that Roberts would print the much more substantial \\"good\\" version a little while later, giving Ling exclusive sales rights, cutting out Trundell. Both would profit, with Ling getting to sell the same play twice.Johnson, Gerald D., 'Nicholas Ling, Publisher 1580-1607'\\", Studies in Bibliography, 38, 1985, pp.203-14. In 1607 he transferred 16 copyrights to John Smethwick, among them three Shakespeare plays (Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and Love's Labour's Lost) as well as The Taming of a Shrew.

While most of Jadaliyya is either self-funded or funded by barter for \\"big projects,\\" it has received grants from the Open Society Institute. According to Portal 9: \\"The Arab uprisings, which gained momentum only a few months after Jadaliyya was established, firmly catapulted it to the forefront of critical debates and analysis of the Arab world.\\" One of the founding editors, George Mason University professor Bassam Haddad, told the Chronicle of Higher Education that Jadaliyya aspires to \\"offer a scholarly, left-of-center ‚Äòcounter discourse‚Äô to the mainstream conversation about the Arab world.\\" Georgetown University professor and contributor Elliot Colla also noted in the Chronicle that, \\"I couldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs a dogma; in fact there‚Äôs a lot of argument and debate [‚Ä¶.] but there is a political project.\\" Finally, another professor described Jadaliyya to the Chronicle as \\"friends publishing friends on issues they agree upon.\\" History Jadaliyya is one in a series of knowledge production projects under the rubric of the Arab Studies Institute. These include an academic research journal (est. 1992), a documentary film collective (est. in 2003), and a publishing house (est. 2012). According to Haddad (who is also founder of the Arab Studies Institute) the impetus behind Jadaliyya originated in 2002 with the intent to create \\"a publication that would have a wider circulation\\" than the scholarly, peer-reviewed Arab Studies Journal. Haddad and his colleague Sinan Antoon believed that \\"good knowledge was being hoarded in journals that are largely inaccessible to the general public\\" and wanted \\"to reach beyond the academic community.\\" The idea was shelved, however, after the Iraq War began in 2003 and their team focused instead on documentary film production producing three films in a period of six years (About Baghdad, What is Said About Arabs and Terrorism, and The Other Threat). In 2009, influenced by new developments in social media, Haddad revisited the project with Antoon, Sherene Seikaly, Nadya Sbaiti, Noura Erakat, and Maya Mikdashi. They completed a private test launch of Jadaliyya during the summer of 2010 and officially launched the ezine on September 21, 2010. Since then, the editorial team has expanded and currently features a total number of 15 co-editors. Jadaliyya was founded on \\"an anti- corporate and solidarity-based model of work. Whenever possible, our mode of operation is largely non-hierarchical, though not without leadership.\\" The goal of the co-editors was to make an interactive and \\"user-friendly\\" website with open language (English, Arabic, and French) and submission length. The editors also utilized a number of social media formats including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, tablet and mobile phone apps, and Readspeaker. According to Haddad: \\"nearly every submission goes through a rigorous review process that includes at least two reviews before going to the copy editor.\\" Response Jadaliyya has been influential in both educational environments and the media. Ursula Lindsey in The Chronicle of Higher Education notes that Jadaliyya has \\"become a reference for many professors in the field. It reaches beyond academia as well. Updated daily, the site boasts about half a million unique visitors a month, and its articles are widely shared on social media [....] Jadaliyya‚Äôs reception has been largely positive among scholars of the Middle East.\\" In addition, Assistant Professor of Anthropology Julia Elyachar states that: > Jadaliyya has quickly become the go-to place for information and analysis of > what is going on in Egypt and the region. Moreover, Jadaliyya is the place > where writing of a kind that we associate with the best of anthropology--in > the moment, grounded in theory, capturing historical transformation through > engagement in events as they unfold--has been published.

Furthermore, The Guardian states that \\"the Arab [Studies] Institute‚Äôs Jadaliyya website is an invaluable resource\\" while Al- masry Al-youm (English Edition) suggests that it \\"quickly became a port of call for many wanting to understand the tumultuous events unfolding across the region\\" by offering \\"more nuanced, in-depth coverage than most, but without the delays and exclusivity of academic journals.\\" In addition, Portal 9 refers to Jadaliyya as \\"an essential resource for many in and outside the Arab world\\" while Today's Zaman calls it \\"one of the leading English language Arab websites.\\" Various international and regional media outlets including the Agence France-Presse (AFP), Al Jazeera English,BBC,China Central Television,China Radio International, CNN, Democracy Now,Deutsche Welle,El Mundo, The Guardian,Le Figaro,MSNBC,The PBS NewsHour,Russia Today,The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post have featured interviews with Jadaliyya Co-Editors. In addition, media outlets such as The Guardian and Courrier International have republished Jadaliyya articles either in their original form or translated them into different languages. Book The Dawn of the Arab Uprisings: End of an Old Order?, (Pluto Press, 2012) is edited by three of Jadaliyya's co-editors, Bassam Haddad, Rosie Bsheer, and Ziad Abu- Rish. Composed of twenty essays originally published in Jadaliyya, the text (according to the editors) sheds \\"light on the historical background and initial impact of the mass uprisings which have shaken the Arab world since December 2010 [‚Ä¶.] while the book focuses on those states that have been most affected by the uprisings it also covers the impact on Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq.\\" Timothy Mitchell, professor of Middle Eastern Studies at Columbia University, observes that \\"as the work of scholars and activists with a rich knowledge of the region's histories and political aspirations, the essays offer lasting insights into the forces shaping a new moment in world history.\\" Laleh Khalili, Senior Lecturer in Middle East Politics, SOAS, University of London suggests that The Dawn of the Arab Uprisings: End of an Old Order? is \\"a very rare combination - scholarly but also accessible for a broad public.\\" She also argues that it will be \\"a much- treasured volume for undergraduate students, and its sophistication will also benefit postgraduates and academics.\\"CUNY anthropologist Talal Asad frames the text as \\"perhaps the best introduction to the political movements that have shaken that region since January 2011.

Arian councils  Stephen was present at the Council of Sardica (343) leading the arian party alongside Acacius of Caesarea, the successor of Eusebius of Nicomedia, where he fought for the depositions of Athanasius and Marcellus of Ancyra, something the orthodox party, spearheaded by Hosius, was not prepared to do. Angry with the result, the arians left the council and reunited again at the so-called Council of Philippopolis, which condemned the two bishops and pronounced an anathema against the Fathers at Sardica.

He was the critic of drama and music at The Cleveland Leader newspaper (now The Plain Dealer). To explore more innovative theatrical ideas than what was available in Cleveland at the time, O'Neil traveled to Europe to study newer forms of theatrical expression, including at the Moscow Art Theatre and the work of Max Reinhardt. After returning to Cleveland, O'Neil and his friend Henry Keller began experimenting with new theatrical techniques involving puppets, cardboard, shadows and light. The popularity of O'Neil and his shadow plays led him to become he first art director at the Cleveland Play House in 1915. However, he was not a theatre manager nor was he interested in the operation of a professional theatre company. A dreamer at heart, O'Neil resigned from the Play House in 1921 to pursue other opportunities in live theatre. Following his resignation at the Play House, O'Neil formed a company of professional black actors in Chicago. He was inspired from seeing, \\"African American nightclub performers in Chicago.\\"Wintz, Cary D. and Paul Finkelman. Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance. New York: Routledge, 2004.

Nagaraja Rao (Kannada: ‡≤∏‡≤ø ‡≤ï‡≥Ü ‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤ú ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤µ‡≥ç, 12 June 1915 ‚Äì 10 April 1998) was a Kannada writer, dramatist, stage artist, director, journalist and social activist. He was the first recipient of the Moortidevi Award instituted by Bharatiya Jnanpith for his magnum opus \\"Pattamahadevi Shantaladevi\\" in 1983. , Bharatiya Jnanpith Moortidevi Laureates. The same work received \\"Best Creative Literary Work\\" award by the Karnataka Sahitya Academy in 1978. Early life C.K. Nagaraja Rao was born on 12 June 1915 in Challakere, Chitradurga district to C.S. Krishnamurthy Rao and Smt. Puttamma. His childhood was spent in various cities around India and he developed a keen interest in the rich art and cultural heritage of Karnataka, India. As a school boy, he volunteered to waited upon Mahatma Gandhi during his stay at Nandi Hills near Bangalore, India. The interaction with Gandhi and his close association with his uncle, Justice Nittoor Srinivasa Rao, instilled in him devotion for India's freedom and welfare of its needy people. Rao's literary career began when he won a school competition for his short story \\"Kaadu Mallige\\" about a Dalit (untouchable) music lover who was not allowed to sit with patrons from the upper castes during concerts. He worked with Satya Shodhana Pustaka Bhandara, an Kannada book printer and publisher whose motto was the promotion of the rich cultural heritage of Karnataka. Under the guidance of his uncle Justice Nittor Srinivasa Rao, C.K. Nagaraja Rao had the opportunity to mingle with leading writers and literati of Karnataka. After a few years of work at Satya Shodhana, he took over responsibilities as secretary of the Kannada Sahitya Parishath and worked with influential writers like Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, B. M. Srikantaiah and others which further strengthened his resolve to delve deeper into the heritage of Karnataka. Research: history and culture of Karnataka The extensive research by C.K. Nagaraja Rao led to his publishing many research papers. Amongst his earliest research works was a book titled ‚ÄúKavi Lakshmeeshana Kaala Mattu Sthala‚Äù, on the celebrated Kannada poet Lakshmeesha. The book won an award from the Karnataka Sahitya Academy for the research content. He also authored many research papers on the Chalukya, Ganga and Hoysala dynasties which were published in the journals of the Mythic Society and other journals and newspapers like Vani, Samyukta Karnataka, Praja Vaani etc. Historical novels His research into the Hoysala period, regarded as one of the golden periods in the history of Karnataka, led to the unearthing of stone inscriptions that shed light into the motherhood of Hoysala Queen Shantaladevi, thus debunking the myth that she committed suicide for being childless. Through his research he was able to establish that Queen Shantaladevi was the mother of three sons and a daughter. In the year 1977, he self -published his magnum opus \\"Pattamahadevi Shantaladevi\\", a historical novel spanning 2162 pages. This work was hailed as \\"Gadya Mahakavya\\" by historians, critics and readers alike. Sri M.V. Kamat, the editor of Illustrated weekly of India lauded the novel as the biggest literary work ever published. The Hindi translation of this novel translated by Sri P. Venkatachala Sharma and published by Bharatiya Jnanapith has been well received. C.K. Nagaraja Rao wrote two additional novels \\"Veeraganga Vishnuvardhana\\" and \\"Dayada Daavanala?\\" that further chronicle the history and times of the Hoysala dynasty. These novels record the history through hundreds of characters, many historical, and some imaginary to strengthen the narration. He penned \\"Sri Pruthvi Vallabha\\", covering the Chalukya dynasty and the period of their famous King Tailapa. Theatre and radio plays He formed his own troupe called United Artists in Bangalore. He directed plays of well- known Kannada playwrights like T.P. Kailasam, Kuppali Venkatappagowda Puttappa and others. He developed his own style of makeup for theatre artists and was recognised as one of the best make-up artists of his times. He was closely associated with All India Radio Bangalore as an actor and producer of radio plays. Other activities * C.K.

The company was formed by le Roy, a Frenchman, Pictet, a Swiss from Geneva, and Sonntag, a German. There were two other corporations active in the field of recruiting settlers to Russia, one formed by the Frenchman Baron Caneu de Beauregard with Major Otto Friedrich of Monjou and the other, with no independent funding, by Jean de Boffe, Meusnier de Precour, and Quentin Benjamin Coulhette d'Hautervive.Philipp Keim, Die Wolgadeutschen von der Einwanderung bis zur Aufhebung des Kolonistenkontors, dissertation, Norderstedt: GRIN books on demand, 2006, , p. 28 To settlers wearied by wars and economic crises, Catherine promised freedom of religion, exemptions from taxes and military service, and the right to dispose of their land as they wished. Thousands of German craftsmen and farmers responded to these recruitment efforts and founded 103 German villages on both sides of the Volga; they are thus known as the Volga Germans. Le Roy and Pictet established 25 colonies comprising 1,530 families with 5,339 people, along the Volga south of Saratov and to the east on its left tributaries the Karaman and Tarlyk, for example the colony of Lauwe, now Yablonovka, founded as a Lutheran colony on 19 August 1767.Lauwe, Original Colonies, Settlements along the Volga, The Center for Volga German Studies, Concordia University (Oregon), 23 April 2012.Ray Heinle, Lauwe: A German Village on the Volga River, Germans from Russia Heritage Society, retrieved 4 December 2012.

It was one of three early projects by aircraft designer Jimmy Wedell to create a racer and was built specifically to compete in the 1930 All-American Flying Derby from Buffalo to Detroit. It was a braced, low-wing monoplane originally powered by an inline Cirrus engine and equipped with fixed landing gear in large spats. A replica Model 22 is on display at the Louisiana State Museum, Patterson, Louisiana. Design and development Experienced air-racer Wedell formed a business partnership in 1929 with millionaire Harry P. Williams after giving him flying lessons. Initial plans were to teach flying, provide an aerial photography service and win an airmail contract. Wedell's passion for air-racing led him to convince Williams to build a racer for the January, 1930 Miami Air Races. This first aircraft was named \\"We-Will\\" but as development and testing continued it became apparent it would not be ready for the 1930 Miami event. Wedell halted development of the \\"We-Will\\" design and began two new aircraft, the \\"We-Winc\\" and the \\"We-Will Jr\\".Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 23. Of these two aircraft, the We-Will Jr would eventually evolve into the \\"Model 22\\". It was designed to compete in the American Cirrus Engine Company's \\"All-American Flying Derby\\". The only requirement was one of the Cirrus aircraft engines be used in the competing racer. Williams chose the supercharged 110 hp Hi-Drive engine which was a popular choice of racers at the time. Gross weight was 1,660 lbs and it could carry 54 gallons of gasoline.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, pp. 24‚Äì26. Operational history The race began at Detroit, Michigan on July 21, 1930 and was a 5,500 mile cross country endurance race that would end back in Detroit.\\"The Cirrus American Derby\\", Flight Magazine, August 29, 1930, p. 978. The hazardous nature of the journey and level of technology at the time challenged the participants and their machines to the utmost. Wedell, piloting the NR10337 and sporting the race number 17, was in contention for first place all the way to the stop at Houston. After this mechanical trouble hampered his efforts and reduced his finish to eighth place.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 29. The NR10337 was next entered in the 1930 National Air Races in Chicago. With the underpowered Cirrus Hi-Drive the performance of the craft was disappointing. Wedell flew in the 350cu free-for-all, finishing third and in the 450cu free-for-all finishing fifth. Wedell turned his attention to the larger We-Will and We-Willc, with the NR10337 languishing until 1932. In order to compete in the lower power classes, the aircraft was substantially rebuilt. The fuselage was shortened from the wing root aft, the wings were shortened while the Cirrus engine was retained. A Hamilton Standard ground adjustable propeller was fitted for the first time to the Cirrus. The cockpit and cowling were redesigned to be more aerodynamic. Aerodynamic wheel \\"pants\\" and \\"spats\\" made its first appearance on a Wedell-Williams design, a feature that would be an icon of its larger, more successful cousins. The aircraft was re-registered as NR60Y and was officially designated \\"Model 22\\". In this configuration the NR60Y competed in smaller races throughout the south during 1932. In preparation for the 1933 Los Angeles National Air Races, the NR60Y's Cirrus engine was replaced with a Menasco B6 Buccaneer air-cooled engine. Given race number 54, it was entered in the Shell Speed Dash 550cu race and piloted by W.A. McDonald. In the preliminary events, the Menasco proved troublesome and performance was disappointing. While taxiing, the Menasco engine backfired and ignited the fabric fuselage. The engine was removed from the frame and later installed in the NR64Y. The frame was placed in storage at the Western Airways hangar in Los Angeles until 1934 when Dave Elmendorf purchased it.\\"NR60Y.\\" Aerofiles.com. Retrieved: January 8, 2012. 1933 brought more development on the Model 22. A second aircraft, NR64Y, was begun in cooperation with the Delgato Trade School in New Orleans. Construction of this aircraft was overseen by a senior mechanic E.D. Dennis. The entire rear fuselage was covered mainly with plywood utilizing a Delgato design. Not ready in time for the 1933 Nationals, NR64Y was trucked to Chicago for the 1933 International Air Races. After a brief test flight on September 1, the aircraft proved to be underpowered with the Menasco B6. Wedell entered one event but retired after a single lap. Testing continued briefly on February 5, 1934, but Wedell decided that further testing of the NR64Y was not warranted and donated the aircraft to Louisiana State University where it was eventually scrapped. In 1934, Elmendorf began reconstruction of his Model 22. Al Novotny, a former Wedell- Williams employee was hired for the work. A Menasco B6 was fitted to the airframe. Elmendorf flew the NR60Y from Los Angeles to Cleveland for the 1935 National Air Races. He entered the 549cu race as number 22 and qualified fourth but finished a disappointing seventh. In 1936, Elmendorf sold NR60Y and it is presumed the airframe was scrapped.  Specifications (Model 22 NR60Y)  See also References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Foxworth, Thomas G. The Speed Seekers.

(alternate: Peruvian Corporation of London) was registered under the Companies Act in London on 20 March 1890. Its board of directors included ten members led by Sir Alfred Dent G A Ollard, of Smiles and Co Solicitors, was Manager in London, T E Webb was Secretary, with Clinton Dawkins and William Davies (Grace Brothers - Callao) as the first representatives in Peru. The company was formed with the purpose of canceling Peru's external debt and to release its government from loans it had taken out through bondholders at three times (in 1869, 1870, 1872), in order to finance the construction of railways. The main purpose of the incorporation included acquiring the rights and undertaking the liabilities of bondholders.  History  After winning independence from Spain in 1826, Peru was financially strapped. Over the decades financial problems worsened, and Peru needed money. In 1865 then 1866, bonds were issued that were retired with new bonds in 1869. More bonds were issued in 1870 but the 1869 bonds were not addressed. New bonds were again issued in 1872 and again previous bonds were not addressed. A major problem, that would take many years to resolve, was that the rich guano deposits were used as security on all the bonds. Peru struggled to make bond interest payments but on December 18, 1875, Peru defaulted. The War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1883) made matters far worse for the country and its creditors, and by 1889 something had to be done about the situation. In London a group formed the Peruvian Corporation to try to resolve the issues and recoup invested money. The objectives of the company were extensive. They included the acquisition of real or personal property in Peru or elsewhere, dealing in land, produce, and property of all kinds, constructing and managing railways, roads, and telegraphs, and carrying on the business usually carried on by railway companies, canal companies, and telegraph companies. It also was involved in constructing and managing docks and harbours, ships, mines, beds of nitrates, managing the State domains, and acting as agents of the Peruvian Government. Grace Contract William Russell Grace and Michael P. Grace had formed the Grace Brothers & Co. (later the W.R. Grace and Company) in 1865, and had a vast business empire with interests in Lima, and Callo in Peru; as well as Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepcion in Chile. By 1889 these interests included a large guano trade as well as Grace Line shipping. Moves to address the Peruvian financial crisis included the Elias-Castellon and Irigoyen-Delgado-Donoughmore protocols, that were formalized by 1890. Michael Grace and Lord Donoughmore were able to get the Grace Contract (originating in 1886) ratified in 1890 also. =Original terms = Terms of the Grace Contract were that the Peruvian Corporation took over the depreciated bonds of the Peruvian Government on the condition that the Government-owned railroads and the guano exportation be under their control for a period of years. The bonds were exchanged for stock in the Peruvian Corporation. William Davies of Argentina and Peru, ran the Peruvian Corporation for W.r. Grace and Company. The corporation later surrendered the bonds to the Peruvian Government in exchange for the following concessions: the use for 66 years of all the railroad properties of the Peruvian Government, most important of which were the Southern Railway of Peru and the Central Railway of Peru; assignment of the guano existing in Peruvian territory, especially on certain adjacent islands, up to the amount of 2,000,000 tons; certain other claims on guano deposits, especially in the Lobos and other islands; 33 annual payments by the Peruvian Government, each of $400,000. =Modifications= In 1907, this arrangement was modified by an extension of the leases of the railways from 1956 to 1973, by a reduction in the number of annual payments from 33 to 30, and by a further agreement on the part of the Peruvian Corporation to construct certain railroad extensions to Cuzco and to Huancayo. The bonds of this corporation were largely held by English, French, and Dutch subjects. Consequently, the diplomatic representatives of these countries in Peru sought proper interest in the welfare of their nationals, the bondholders. A new arrangement was created in 1955, whereby a Canadian company, the Peruvian Transport Corporation Ltd., acquired and held the outstanding share capital of the Peruvian Corporation. Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles del Peru (ENAFER) was formed in 1972, and was taken over by the Government at the end of that year. The company's archives for the period of 1849-1967 are held at University College London.

Life  Lachnit was born in the small town of Gittersee; his family moved to Dresden in 1906. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule Dresden under Richard Guhr, and later at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where he was acquainted with and influenced by Otto Dix, Conrad Felixm√ºller, and Otto Griebel. He joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1924 and was active in producing various forms of Agitprop throughout the 1920s. He co-founded the \\"Neue Gruppe\\" with Hans Grundig, Otto Griebel, and Fritz Skade; successful exhibitions in Paris, D√ºsseldorf, Amsterdam, and Dresden followed. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Lachnit's work was declared \\"degenerate\\" and confiscated by authorities. During this period he was not allowed to make art and worked as an exhibition designer. Much of his confiscated work was destroyed during the February 1945 firebombing of Dresden. His 1923 watercolours Man and Woman in the Window and \\"Girl at Table\\" were found in the Munich Art Hoard. Lachnit continued to paint after the end of World War II. In 1947 he was appointed professor at the Hochschule f√ºr Bildene K√ºnste Dresden. Among his more important students were J√ºrgen B√∂ttcher, Manfred B√∂ttcher, and Harald Metzkes.

Early years Mac Arnold was born in Ware Place, South Carolina, one of 13 children born and raised on a sharecropper's farm. Arnold's musical journey began in the 1950s when he and his brother Leroy fashioned a guitar from a steel gas can, broomsticks, wood, nails, and screen wire: Arnold has since become famous for the gas-can guitar and has taught many other people how to make them. His early career included working with a young James Brown in the band, J. Floyd & the Shamrocks. Arnold moved to Chicago in 1965, where he worked with A.C. Reed prior to joining Muddy Waters' band in 1966. Arnold appears on the November 1966 live recording released in 2009 as Muddy Waters - Authorized Bootleg. He formed the Soul Invaders in 1967, finding work backing up B.B. King, The Temptations, Little Milton and many others. Mac's studio work in the 1960s includes playing bass on several notable blues albums, including Otis Spann's The Blues Is Where It's At and John Lee Hooker's Live At Cafe Au Go Go. He performed in various session work after moving to California in the 1970s. Arnold's distinctive bass line can be heard on the theme for the TV show Sanford and Son. His TV work also included a four-year gig as part of the set band on Soul Train. Later years By the 1990s, Arnold had grown weary of the road life and returned home to Pelzer, South Carolina and virtual retirement from the spotlight until 2006, when he was convinced to front his own band, Plate Full O' Blues. Arnold's return to the stage was the subject of a 2-part musical-history documentary, Stan Woodward's final film, Nothing to Prove: Mac Arnold's Return to the Blues. In 2013, Arnold opened his own restaurant in Greenville, South Carolina's historic West End, where he hosted his popular yearly music event, The Cornbread and Collard Greens Blues Festival. Despite much local success in the food business, he decided to close the restaurant in August 2017 to once again concentrate on music, especially after his nomination into the Alabama Blues Hall of Fame.Greenville' arts festival, October 2013 On September 23, 2017, Mac Arnold was inducted into the Alabama Blues Hall of Fame at the historic Dr. John R.

Metaxism disparaged liberalism, and held individual interests to be subordinate to those of the nation, seeking to mobilize the Greek people as a disciplined mass in service to the creation of a \\"new Greece.\\" Metaxas declared that his 4th of August Regime (1936‚Äì1941) represented a \\"Third Greek Civilization\\" which was committed to the creation of a culturally purified Greek nation based upon the militarist societies of ancient Macedonia and Sparta, which he held to constitute the \\"First Greek Civilization\\"; and the Orthodox Christian ethic of the Byzantine Empire, which he considered to represent the \\"Second Greek Civilization.\\" The Metaxas regime asserted that true Greeks were ethnically Greek and Orthodox Christian, intending to deliberately exclude Albanians, Slavs, and Turks residing in Greece from Greek citizenship. Although the Metaxas government and its official doctrines are often described as fascist, academically it is considered to have been a conventional totalitarian- conservative dictatorship akin to Francisco Franco's Spain or Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar's Portugal.Lee, Stephen J. 2000. European Dictatorships, 1918-1945 Routledge; 2 edition (22 Jun 2000). . The Metaxist government derived its authority from the conservative establishment and its doctrines strongly supported traditional institutions such as the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Monarchy; essentially reactionary, it lacked the radical theoretical dimensions of ideologies such as Italian Fascism and German Nazism. The ideology of Metaxism was associated with Metaxas' political party, the Freethinkers' Party and the 4th of August Regime.Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. Pp. 276. In the post-war period it has been advocated by the 4th of August Party, the Golden Dawn party and the ELAM party.  Main ideas  *Greek nationalism: Promoted cultural purity of the Greek nation and endorsed the creation of a \\"Third Hellenic Civilization\\". *Monarchism: Considered the institution of monarchy a pillar of national unity. *Anti-communism: Metaxism was very hostile to left-wing and communist ideologies. *Anti-parliamentarianism: Denounced the way the old parliamentary system operated, as a cause of anarchy, division and economic decline. Metaxas died leaving an unfinished plan (never published), concerning a \\"new constitution\\", without the disadvantages -according to his opinion- of the old system. *Corporatism: Worked strongly through corporate groups and trade unions. *Protectionism: Considered the market-liberal policies of the old state to have failed. *Anti-imperialism: Opposed the domination and influence of Greece by foreign powers. History Ioannis Metaxas Alexandros Papagos, leader of Greek Rally. The ideology developed by Metaxas began with Metaxas' response to the revolution of 1922 that put in a pro-republican government in Greece. Metaxas formed the Freethinkers' Party, a monarchist party that originally supported the advancement of civil liberties, though this changed with Metaxas' evolving political views.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 170. Metaxas supported the failed counterrevolution by monarchists against the republican-oriented government on October 23, 1923 that collapsed within a week, an arrest warrant was issued for Metaxas who fled Greece to exile in Norway. The pro-republican government achieved its aim in 1924 when the Greek monarchy was deposed and a Greek republic was established. In 1924, Metaxas officially changed his position from opposition to the republic to acceptance of its institutions. In the 1926 general election, Metaxas' Freethinkers' Party won 54 out of 250 seats in the Greek parliament, resulting in the party becoming part of Greece's coalition government and Metaxas becoming Minister of Communications.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 171-172. However the Freethinkers' Party collapsed in public support in the 1928 election, losing almost all of its seats, including Metaxas' own seat.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 172. By the 1930s, Metaxas openly condemned the parliamentary system in Greece. In 1935, Metaxas' party joined other monarchist parties in an electoral coalition known as the United Royalists that called for the restoration of the monarchy, however the Freethinkers' Party won only seven seats in the election.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 174. However, a monarchist government was formed in Greece in 1935 resulting in the restoration of King George II of Greece as head of state. King George II had held close relations with Metaxas in the past and appointed Metaxas as Prime Minister of Greece in May 1936. Upon becoming Prime Minister, Metaxas made clear his discontent with the political deadlock between feuding political blocs in Greece's parliament and the rising labour unrest being exploited by the Communist Party of Greece. Metaxas quickly sought to crush dissent including labour unrest in the form of decrees that did not require acceptance by the Greek parliament. On August 4, 1936, Metaxas gained the King's support for a decree that dissolved parliament. He declared martial law, suspended civil rights such as liberty of the subject, and mobilized transport and public workers to support him.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 180. Metaxas justified these actions as necessary to prevent communist revolution. Numerous arrests were made of leftist leaders and others following these proclamations. Metaxas abolished all political parties including his own, ruling as an official independent.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 181. This date is considered the beginning of Metaxas' totalitarian rule known as the 4th of August Regime. Metaxas was referred to by supporters as the Archigos (Leader) and promised to create a \\"New State\\" in Greece that called for Greeks to wholly commit themselves to the nation with self-control as the Spartans had done.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 184. Supporters of the 4th of August Regime justified Metaxas' dictatorship on the basis that the \\"First Greek Civilization\\" involved the Athenian dictatorship of Pericles who had brought ancient Greece to greatness. Metaxas introduced widespread strict censorship of the press and banned literature of authors considered taboo by the regime, including literature by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Immanuel Kant. Metaxas sought the creation of a disciplined younger generation as being critical for the future of Greece and for the strengthening of his regime and its principles that world entrench the Third Greek Civilization.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 185. In October 1936 the regime created the National Youth Organization of Greece (EON) that gained 200,000 members by 1938 and by 1939 when youth membership in the EON became mandatory, it absorbed the Boy Scouts of Greece. Members of the EON took an oath of fidelity to the principles of the 4th of August that included: embracing the institutions of the monarchy; support of national pride and faith of the Greek civilization; opposition to parliamentarianism and communism; support of the development of egalitarian, non-individualistic, virtuous citizens.J√ºrgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 185-186. In spite of the Metaxas regime's ties to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany*Payne, Stanley G. 1995. A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì45. University of Wisconsin Press. it was drawn into World War II opposite the Axis Powers after the Italian invasion of Greece, Metaxas then aligned his government with the allies until Greece capitulated and yielded to occupation by the Axis powers following the Battle of Greece. Metaxas died on 29 January 1941, leaving an unfinished plan (never published), concerning a \\"new constitution\\" for Greece aiming to a new form of government without the disadvantages of the old parliamentary system. In religious affairs, the regime followed the tradition of the state controlling and using the religious and ecclesiastic institutions. The regime was tolerant towards the religious minorities (mainly Jews and Muslims), who were mainly conservative and hostile towards the Venizelism. It was not antisemitic and prohibited antisemitic publications by certain newspapers.Isabelle D√©pret, \\"Ioannis Metaxas and Religion (1938-41): Historical Experience and Current Debates in Greece\\", Cahiers balkaniques, 42, 2014 In french  Legacy  The social control which was established by Metaxas and the ideas passed to the youth, especially through the National Youth Organisation, had a significant influence on the Greek society and the post-war political system. Some examples are the censorship, which was in use until the Metapolitefsi, and the surviving elements of a police state. In the immediate post-war era Metaxism was advocated by the 4th of August Party. The ideas of the 4th of August Regime was also an extra motive for the group of right-wing army officers who seized power in a coup d'√©tat and led to the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974. Today the only party of the Greek parliament which claims to follow the ideas of Metaxas is the right-wing extremist Golden Dawn. Other far-right parties such as Popular Greek Patriotic Union which split from the Golden Dawn also claim to follow Metaxism.

The river forms in White Plains and Harrison and flows south through Mamaroneck Town and Village, where it empties into Mamaroneck Harbor and Long Island Sound. The name of the river comes from a local native American word meaning, \\"where the fresh water meets the salt water.\\" The river flows into Long Island Sound. The watershed of the Mamaroneck River is 17.4 square miles. It is dominated by suburban residential neighborhoods and commercial and retail tracts. High density residential development also is prevalent throughout the middle and lower portions of the watershed. Detail Originating 430 feet above sea level in a small wetlands area in Harrison, the river flows south along the eastern boundary of White Plains. It joins the 'East Branch' near the junction of Anderson Hill Road and Westchester Avenue. The Mamaroneck River flows another 2.5 miles to its confluence with the 'West Branch', where it forms the river's main stem. Human encroachment into the stream corridor and manipulation of the stream channel are byproducts of intense residential construction in and around the river's headwaters. The main stem of the Mamaroneck River flows southeasterly, paralleling Westchester Avenue and the Hutchinson River Parkway. Below the parkway, the river flows south to its confluence with the West Branch of the Mamaroneck River at the Mamaroneck Reservoir. South of the reservoir, the river forms the municipal boundary between Mamaroneck Village and Harrison. At the New England Thruway, the Mamaroneck River flows southward through Mamaroneck Village, where it joins the Sheldrake River and finally emptying into Mamaroneck Harbor on Long Island Sound. Tributaries Two principal tributaries enter the Mamaroneck River, one from the east and one from the west. The East Branch of the Mamaroneck River is the furthest upstream tributary and originates in north Harrison near the intersection of Westchester Avenue and Anderson Hill Road. The West Branch originates just south of the Hutchinson River Parkway near Mamaroneck Avenue. The East Branch of the Mamaroneck River is 3.3 miles long. The main stem is 1.9 miles long north of its confluence with the east branch. The east branch originates from a small pond in north Harrison at about 400 feet above sea level and then flows southeast 0.7 miles into Forest Lake. South of Forest Lake, it flows westerly to its confluence with the main stem. The West Branch of the Mamaroneck River is the smallest of the Mamaroneck River's two primary tributaries, draining an area of 2.3 square miles just south and southeast of downtown White Plains. The west branch originates from a wetland and pond adjacent to Archbishop Stepinac High School on Mamaroneck Avenue and flows about 2.75 miles south and southwest through several stormwater management basins to its confluence with the main stem near the intersection of Mamaroneck Avenue and Hutchinson River Parkway.

Camp Five Echo is a once secret \\"disciplinary block\\" built as part of the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. The press first reported on the existence of the camp in December 2011 when attorneys for Shaker Aamer, who had been held at the camp for extended periods of time, complained that conditions there were inhumane. According to Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, the camp is used to punish captives. Like Camp Platinum, Camp Strawberry Fields and Camp No, Camp Five Echo had never been mentioned when journalists and other visitors are given tours of the internment facility. Construction history Rosenberg reported the camp was constructed in November 2007, on the grounds of Camp Five. However, unlike Camp Five and Camp Six, which are copies of prisons designed for the United States Bureau of Prisons, Camp Five Echo is built out of recycled shipping containers. According to Rosenberg a February 2009 report prepared by Admiral Patrick Walsh, on overall compliance with the Geneva Conventions, described the camp as \\"an open air facility with 24 individual adjoining steel mesh cells arranged in two parallel and equal rows.\\" Walsh wrote that captives were first held in Camp Five Echo in April 2008. Rosenberg wrote that she did not know when the mesh walls were replaced with steel plates. A military spokesman said the cells in \\"Five Echo\\" are only half the size of the ones in Camp Five, but he asserted this was still within the acceptable range of sizes. Like the original Camp Xray the cells were equipped with a squat toilet. Water for washing was via a tap in the wall‚Äîcaptives had no wash basin. Captives, like Shaker Aamer, have told their attorneys that the solid steel walls made it practically impossible for them to talk with one another. On 2011 Rosenberg reported about the cost and other details of the camp, obtained from an email sent by camp spokesperson Commander Tamsen Reese. The camp cost $690,000. Walsh's report said that captives had been first held in the camp in April 2008. Use Admiral Walsh's report said the camp was first used on April 28, 2008. Attorney David Remes who said that, in addition to Shaker Aamer, two more of his clients were sent there, said the condition in the camp violate the Geneva Conventions and called it \\"a throwback to the bad old days at Guant√°namo.\\" Aamer had been held in solitary confinement in the camp for over 100 days when camp authorities revealed its existence. Colonel Donnie Thomas, commander of the camp's guards, said the Camp Five Echo was \\"...safe, humane and meets all the regulations.\\" While he declined to say what kinds of infractions caused captives to be sent to Camp Five Echo, he did say where they were held was based on their compliance with camp rules, \\"Quite frankly, detainees make the determination where they live.\\" Shortly after Aamer's four and half month stay in the camp triggered the publication of the photo, Thomas said that the camp was currently empty, but declined to say at that time when it had last been used. Camp rules only permit captives to be kept in solitary confinement for a maximum of thirty days. Another of Aamer's lawyers Ramzi Kaseem, said Aamer described the condition as \\"abysmal\\", \\"the squat toilet is difficult to use, there are foul odors, bright lights shine on detainees, and air conditioners keep it extremely cold.\\", \\"It is decrepit, filthy, and disgusting\\". Aamer also told Kaseem the cells were not large enough to pray. In an article marking the tenth anniversary of the opening of the Guantanamo internment facility Rosenberg reported tensions were high. Captives were planning a hunger strike. Captives reported camp authorities had \\"instituted a new 25-day punitive segregation regime for rule breakers in a cramped cell at the once-secret Camp 5 Echo.\\" In May 2012 Kassem reported that the controversial sleep deprivation technique known as the frequent flyer program was being used as a punishment technique in Camp Five Echo.

Thane initially developed as a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough to the west of Indonesia. Over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the northwest, and was declared a Depression during December 25, before being declared Cyclonic Storm Thane during the next day. As it was named, Thane started to turn towards the west under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure before its development slowed during December 27, as a strong outflow and marginally favourable sea surface temperatures fought with persistent vertical wind shear. After its development had slowed during December 27, Thane became a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during December 28, before as it approached the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, it weakened slightly. Thane then made landfall early on December 30, on the north Tamil Nadu coast between Cuddalore and Puducherry and rapidly weakened into a depression. Meteorological history On December 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that a tropical disturbance had developed within the monsoon trough about 1540 km (960 mi) to the east of Medan in Indonesia. Convection surrounding the system had started to consolidate over a weak low level circulation centre, that was being fed by an enhanced westerly flow associated with the precursor system to Tropical Cyclone Benilde. Over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the northwest, with a Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation increasing the system boundary layers rotation. The JTWC then issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system during December 25 before designating as Tropical Cyclone 06B later that day as 1-minute wind speeds near the centre reached 65 km/h (40 mph) which is equivalent to a tropical storm. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) also reported during December 25 that the disturbance had organised sufficiently to be declared Depression BOB 05, while it was located about to the southeast of Chennai, India. Early on December 26, the IMD reported that the depression had intensified into a Deep Depression, before later that day reporting that it had intensified into a cyclonic storm and named it Thane. As it was named, Thane started to turn towards the west under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure before its development slowed as strong outflow and marginally favourable sea surface temperatures fought with persistent easterly vertical wind shear. Early on December 28, the JTWC reported that Thane had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 120 km/h (75 mph), while an eye feature had become visible on microwave imagery. Later that day the IMD reported that Thane had become the first Very Severe Cyclonic Storm of the season, with 3-minute sustained windspeeds of 120 km/h (75 mph). During December 28, Thane continued to intensify, and developed a small pinhole eye of about 20 km (10 mi), before the JTWC reported that Thane had peaked early on December 29 with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 165 km/h (105 mph). The IMD then followed suit and reported that the system had peaked as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm with 3-minute sustained windspeeds of 140 km/h (85 mph). During the rest of that day, the system continued to move westwards and weakened slightly as it started to interact with land. Thane then made landfall as a borderline very severe cyclonic storm during December 30 on the north Tamil Nadu coast between Cuddalore and Puducherry. After it had made landfall, frictional forces made Thane rapidly weaken into a depression. As a result, the JTWC issued their final advisory during December 30, while the IMD continued to monitor the remnants of Thane until the depression weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area early on December 31. Preparations and Impact Tamil Nadu and Puducherry A tree uprooted by Thane in Puducherry Forty eight people were killed by Cyclone Thane. About 7 deaths were reported in Puducherry and 39 people were reported dead in Cuddalore. Cuddalore and Puducherry were the worst affected by Thane. The storm made Cuddalore inaccessible by damaging road network and the National Disaster Response Force and fire and rescue services had difficulty in reaching the cyclone affected fishing hamlets. Fishing activities had come to a complete halt in the cities of Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kanchipuram in the wake of the storm after the warnings by the weather department were received. About 10,000 fishing boats were moved to safer locations in all fishing hamlets in these areas. Chennai Corporation kept its four permanent relief centers (Basin Bridge, Chintadripet, Gopalapuram and Perambur Barracks Road) ready to accommodate people in case of evacuation due to torrential rains. People from low-lying areas were shifted to community centers with adequate arrangements of food and medical round the clock. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ordered the immediate release of 150 crore towards relief and restoration of infrastructure damaged by the Cyclone Thane. She also directed the District Collectors, Deputy Collectors and department Secretaries to assess the extent of the damage caused by Cyclone Thane. Andhra Pradesh 700 fishermen were reported to be stranded near the Nizampatnam Bay area due to the rough sea conditions near the coast due to the cyclone. Owners had asked the government as well as the National Coast Guard for the fishermen's search and rescue after they could not communicate with them. The former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy instructed all the district collectors of the concerned districts of the state, mainly Nellore and Prakasam districts to take all precautionary measures in anticipation of the approaching storm. APSRTC was asked to keep sufficient buses in reserve in case of evacuation of the people. Officials reported that food stocks, drinking water, emergency power etc. were kept ready in reserves.

The three full-page plates depict heretics accused of different crimes wearing sanbenitos, i.e. special tunics that represent their fate: the Samarra, which is covered with dragons, devils, and flames surrounding an image of the heretic himself, signifying that the impenitent heretic was condemned to be burnt alive at the stake, the Fuego revolto, which is covered simply with flames pointing downwards, signifying that the heretic who became penitent after being condemned was not to be burnt alive at the stake, but was to have the mercy of being strangled before the fire was lit and the Sambenito featured red saltires, whose wearer was only to do penance.Lynn Hunt, Margaret C. Jacob, W. W. Mijnhardt, Bernard Picart and the First Global Vision of Religion, Getty Publications, 2010, pp. 292-293 The three folding plates show the following scenes: the procession of the Inquisition into a church, the Inquisition in session within a church and penitents being led from a church to be burned at the stake. The designs for the prints were made by Pierre Paul Sevin.

It indicated that the Vice Presidential flag will follow the pattern of the President's, except that the sun and the corner stars were to be blue to create a distinction.Executive Order No. 310, Manuel L.

This version of the flag was used until 1972 when the office was abolished by Martial Law and subsequently excluded from the original text of the 1973 Constitution. After the position was restored in 1986, a literal reading of Quirino's order caused confusion as to the appearance of the flag and the coat of arms. While the government adopted the seal with a blue background, they have adopted a flag in white background.

The company was incorporated in 1912 as the Duriron Casting Company in Dayton, Ohio by John R. Pitman, William E. Hall, and Pierce D. Schenck.Duriron Company Inc. at Funding Universe (retrieved 26 December 2011) History The company derives its name from a high silicon cast iron alloy, Duriron, which rapidly became an industry standard for handling extremely corrosive materials. Duriron ‚Äúdenitrating towers‚Äù were in high demand during the First World War for safe handling of hot mixtures of nitric and sulfuric acids during the manufacturing of explosives. As a result of the war the company expanded tenfold, increasing its work force from 150 to 1500.Allen Rowland, Scott A. Sanders, DURIRON CORPORATION HISTORICAL COLLECTION MS-251, Paul Laurence Dunbar Library, Special Collections and Archives, Wright State University, June 1994 (retrieved 28 December 2011) During the 1920s and 30s, Duriron faced a major readjustment period since ‚Äúdenitrating towers‚Äù used in the war effort were no longer in demand. The readjustment included the development of a line of more ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù Duriron pumps and valves for use in the broad chemical process industries. The breadth of alloys in which pumps and valves were offered was also greatly expanded to include a variety of nickel-based alloys, one of which, Durimet-20 (a joint development and patent of Ohio State and Duriron), was to become a world standard for handling certain difficult chemicals. The redirection of the company would begin to reap great returns in the 1940s as Duriron‚Äôs products became more widely accepted. During World War II, two thirds of Duriron‚Äôs production was devoted to providing pumps and valves for production of plutonium and uranium for the Manhattan Project which developed the atomic bomb. The company won the prestigious Army/Navy ‚ÄúE‚Äù award for these efforts. Duriron became a publicly traded company in 1946. Subsequent to World War II, Duriron grew consistently in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, through product innovation and technical sales force expansion to serve the fast growing chemical process industries throughout the U.S., Canada and, in the later of those years, in Europe as well. New products included the first use of Teflon as a sealing substance in a patented special alloy non-lubricated plug valve that quickly acquired a dominant position in the chemical valve business. A new heavy duty chemical pump with a patented reverse vane impeller did the same in the chemical pump business. The first all-Teflon-lined valve and pump were also successfully introduced. As a result, revenues grew from $5 million in 1950 to $125 million in 1979. In spite of a decline in revenues in the first years of the 1980s, the company grew from $125 million in 1970 to $605 million in 1996, largely through a number of strategic acquisitions that expanded the line of complementary products available for sale to the chemical process industries. The larger of these acquisitions included Valtek in Springville, Utah, a provider of flow control valves for heavy duty services, and Durametallic Corporation in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which offers mechanical seals for pumps and other rotating equipment.

Arrest, imprisonment and release On 4 March 2011, Hajiyev was questioned by police about Facebook activity related to an upcoming anti-government protest, scheduled for 11 March. Later in the day, he was arrested on charges of having disobeyed a police order not to leave the city of Ganja while charges that he had evaded military service were being investigated. On 7 March, Hajiyev passed his lawyer, Elchin Namazov, a letter stating that he had been beaten, tortured, and threatened with sexual abuse while in custody. When Namazov visited Hajiyev on 7 May, the lawyer saw \\"an open wound on Hajiyev's neck, bruises on his eyes, and a hematoma on the left side of his nose\\". Namazov filed a complaint with Ganja's prosecutor's office, but authorities reportedly failed to investigate Hajivev's claims of abuse. On 18 May, the Nizami District Court of Ganja sentenced Hajiyev to two years' imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan upheld the sentence on 6 December 2011. A government official reported to the court that Hajiyev had been given a negative assessment by prison staff, indicating that he was unrepentant. Hajiyev was released early by the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan for good behavior on 4 June 2012. The announcement came days before a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. International response to imprisonment Several international human rights organizations objected to Hajiyev's arrest and sentence and called for his release. International organizations, including the ComparativeConstitutions Project, have objected to the legality of imprisonment for defying mandatory conscription laws, given the guaranteed rights of Azerbaijani citizens under their own national constitution. Amnesty International described Hajiyev as \\"continually harassed solely for peacefully expressing his views\\", called for an investigation into his allegations of police torture, named him a prisoner of conscience, and called for his immediate release. Human Rights Watch described his arrest and conviction as \\"examples of the Azerbaijani government's efforts to silence dissent\\" and called on European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek to press for Hajiyev's immediate release on a 20 May visit to Azerbaijan. Index on Censorship compared Hajiyev's arrest on a charge unrelated to activism to that of Jabbar Savalan‚Äîan activist imprisoned on charges of marijuana possession‚Äîdescribing it as \\"a tactic increasingly employed to silence dissenting voices\\".

The hospital is part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. While the monument is managed by the National Park Service as part of the National Parks of New York Harbor office, the south side of Ellis Island, including the hospital, is managed by the non- profit Save Ellis Island Foundation and has been off-limits to the general public since its closing in 1954. Constructed in phases, the facility encompassed both a general hospital and a separate pavilion-style contagious disease hospital. The hospital had two functions: first, treating immigrants who were ill upon arrival, and second, treating immigrants with conditions that were prohibited by immigration laws. These latter patients were stabilized and often sent back to their home countries. Between 1902 and 1951 the hospital treated over 275,000 patients; there were approximately 4,000 fatalities and 350 babies were born there.Statistics compiled from annual reports to The Commissioner General of Immigration and The Surgeon General of United States Public Health Service from 1892 to 1954. See chart The Immigrant Hospital was run by the Marine Hospital Service, which was re-organized and expanded in 1902 and became the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. The name was shortened in 1912 and became the United States Public Health Service (PHS). All of the doctors at Ellis Island were part of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service. Nurses and all other medical personnel were employees of the PHS. The PHS doctors conducted the Line Inspection, the medical examination of arriving immigrants, and treated detained immigrants in the hospitals. Efforts to restore the hospital buildings and other structures on the island are being made by the Save Ellis Island Foundation. The hospital complex has been open to the public on a limited basis for Hard Hat tours since 2014 provided by the Save Ellis Island Foundation. History Early 20th-century map showing the \\"Site of Emigrant Hospital\\" Ellis Island as seen from the air in the early 1970s, with the hospital at the southern (left) side of the island which had been created with landfill View of the hospital Need Prior to being an Immigration Station, Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson, an 18th-century fort which was part of the New York Harbor defenses along with the Battery, Fort Wood on Bedloe's Island, and Fort Jay on Governors Island. By the late 19th century, Fort Gibson was obsolete and the Island was used by the Navy to store munitions. The need for hospitals as part of the immigration process was well- established when the new Ellis Island Immigration Station opened. In the 1860s (when immigration was administered by the States,) New York State sent sick immigrants from the main entrance facility at Castle Clinton in the Battery to a separate purpose-built and very effective new hospital facility. Ward's Island Emigrant Hospital, which opened in 1864 was constructed in the Pavilion style, a hygenic layout promoted by Florence Nightingale in her Notes On Hospitals and hailed by the New York Times reported was the exemplar of a modern hospital. As the number of immigrants increased, it was clear that the US Government had to take control of immigration. In 1882 the United States Government passed the Immigration Act of 1882 It excluded immigrants who were Likely to Become a Public Charge (LPC) which meant prospective immigrants who could not demonstrate their ability to work and not require any assistance from the Government or a charity were denied entrance. The law also barred immigrants who were convicts, those convicted of political offences or who were ‚Äúidiots, psychopathics, or afflicted with a loathsome infectious or contagious disease.‚Äù It also established a head tax to be paid to the Federal Government which replaced one charged by New York State, which was declared unconstitutional in 1875 as per Henderson v. Mayor of City of New York, 92 U.S. 259. The local administration, however, was to be carried out by state officers designated by the various states involved. The Immigration Act of 1891 formalized previous immigration laws and gave full authority to the US government, including the ability to enforce the laws and to deport immigrants who did note meet the requirements. The Marine Hospital Service, later renamed the US Public Health Service, was charged with administering the new immigration laws for the Federal Government. First immigration station The original immigration station on Ellis Island opened January 1, 1892. It was built reusing several of the structures from Fort Gibson. A shellhouse was converted into a Hospital for the Insane, the Gunners Quarters became the Surgeon‚Äôs house, a shellhouse became a dining hall and another shellhouse became a detention facility for immigrants awaiting deportation. A 40-bed hospital was constructed ‚Äúa series of wooden structures surrounding a garden.\\" In 1890 when the US government and the State of New York processed immigrants jointly at the Barge Office (a US Government owned facility), patients with contagious diseases were sent to hospitals operated by the New York City Department of Health and to Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, which was then also called the Immigrant Hospital. The hospitals involved were called ‚ÄúContract Hospitals.‚Äù  Reconstruction and expansion  =New hospital on island 2= On June 15, 1897, the wooden immigration station on Ellis Island was destroyed by fire. The Buffalo Evening News reported that all 40 patients were safely evacuated and taken to Bellevue Hospital. By September, the Treasury's Supervising Architect, James Knox Taylor, opened an architecture competition to rebuild the immigration station The competition was the second to be conducted under the Tarsney Act of 1893, which had permitted private architects to design federal buildings, rather than government architects in the Supervising Architect's office.Lee, Antoinette J., Architects to the Nation: The Rise and Decline of the Supervising Architect's Office, Oxford University Press, USA. April 20, 2000. By December, it was announced that Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring had won the competition. Tilton and Boring's plan called for four new structures: a main immigration processing facility in the French Renaissance style, as well as the Kitchen and Laundry Building, Main Powerhouse, and the Main Hospital Building The plan also included the creation of a new island (island 2)-- upon which the hospital would be built, south of the existing island (island 1). The Main Immigration Building and structures on Island 1 were completed and opened in December 1900. Work creating Island 2 was completed in 1898. Work then started on the hospital and other buildings. The New Hospital (Hospital Building No. 1) was built between February 1900 and March 1901 and included an Outbuilding and Surgeon‚Äôs House. \\"The hospital outbuilding included a laundry, linen room, and autopsy room. The surgeon‚Äôs house was designed and constructed with a basement; a parlor, kitchen, pantry, dining room, library, and hall on the first floor; and five bedrooms, hall, and bath on the second floor.\\" Work on these buildings was complete at the end of 1901, but they did not open until 1902 because of delays during construction. The Immigrant Hospital was initially staffed by the Marine Hospital Service, which became the U.S. Public Health Service PHS). It was one of the first facilities in the country to employ a full-time female physician, Dr. Rose A. Bebb.http://gardenstatelegacy.com/files/Finding_a_Remarkable_Life_on_Ellis_Island_Kaufmann_GSL20.pdf Physicians treated an incredible range of disease, from measles, tuberculosis, trachoma, scarlet fever, Favus, and diphtheria, to tropical diseases imported from the opposite side of the earth. The hospital was an extremely effective institution. Its mortality rate was on par or better than most comparable hospitals. In 1917 Dr. Wilson, a PHS physician stationed at Ellis Island, conducted a study of the hospitals. He wrote that \\"Although the incidence of cross-infection contracted in hospital has not entirely ceased, it has reached such a low point (for the past year 0.63 percent of all admissions) that it is believed a description of the hospital, with special reference to the provisions to prevent the spread of disease, will be found interesting and instructive.\\" The PHS used advanced methods in medicine as they developed. They used fluoroscopy and x-rays; there was an autoclave that could sterilize 4 entire mattresses at a time. For many immigrants, new medical equipment was unfamiliar and scary. According to one New York Times article, ‚Äúthose less fortunate had to submit to physical inspections that required stripping off all of one‚Äôs clothing ‚Äì an entirely foreign concept, particularly to many immigrant women. This is why there were female physicians stationed on the medical inspection line. Some immigrants had no idea what X-ray machines did; others were fearful that their clothing ‚Äì or the money sewn inside its seams ‚Äì would be stolen.‚Äù The volume of immigrants quickly overwhelmed Hospital 1‚Äôs capacity of 125 beds. As the number of immigrants increased, the number of ‚Äúpsychopathic‚Äù or ‚Äúinsane‚Äù patients grew as well. Because their entry in the US was prohibited by Immigration law and because these patients needed to be housed in a separate facility, a new secure ward was required. The Psychopathic Ward, situated between the Hospital Outbuilding and the Main hospital on Island 2, opened in 1907. The Administration building was added in 1906/7 which added another 125 beds. As the number of immigrants nearly doubled, from 493,267 in 1902 to 1,004,756 in 1907, the hospitals were still extremely overcrowded. Between 1908 and 1909 a third building was constructed that has several names, originally called the hospital extension it was renamed Hospital Number 2 because it was almost the same size and layout as the first hospital. It had a capacity of 125 beds. When it opened it enabled the PHS to distribute patients to hospitals 1 and 2 and use the Administration building for its original purpose. When Hospital 2 was completed the facility had a capacity of 300 beds. = Contagious disease hospital on island 3 = Hospital #1 was designed as a General Hospital. The PHS intended there to be a companion, separate, Contagious Hospital as was the practice in the civilian hospitals, such as Johns Hopkins Hospital, after which Ellis Island's hospitals were modeled, but the government would not fund a contagious hospital. With no facilities to treat infectious or contagious disease patients on site, Ellis Island maintained its Contract Hospital relationship with the Health Department of New York and Long Island College Hospitals who had been caring for Ellis Island contagious disease patients since 1890.INS annual reports 1890-1892 In 1903 New York announced it wanted to terminate the agreement because the number of patients being sent to New York strained their capacity. The Bureau of Immigration considered the most practical solution was to build a third island, separated from island 2 by a ferry basin. In response, the Surgeon General indicated that an island ‚Äúwith an outside limit of 410 feet from the present island and with 200 feet of clear water space between the two islands, would be amply sufficient to ensure freedom from danger of contagion according to modern ideas of hospital construction. Contemporary hospital design and medical knowledge indicated that a single building was less desirable than a series of several small pavilions, where various diseases could be treated in isolation from other wards.\\" The island measured . The ferry basin was later infilled. The area chosen was between island 2 and Liberty Island and adjacent to the Jersey City waterfront area known locally as Black Tom. Infill and construction was started but New Jersey claimed title to the area and New York and New Jersey went to court over this Riparian Rights Issue. The government would not permit construction to continue until the land issue was resolved. In 1904, the courts ruled and determined that the location of the proposed island 3 was indeed part of New York. The Immigration Department now had clear title and construction was resumed, By the end of 1909 island 3 and the new contagious disease hospitals were completed, but insufficient funds had been allocated to connect the utilities and purchase furniture and equipment for the facility. Congressional authorization for the required funds was not achieved until 1911 and the hospitals opened later that year. The island 3 buildings included eight two- story-pavilions designated for measles patients, three Isolation Wards, a morgue/autopsy building, a medical office building; and a three-story administrative building that contained the admitting and discharge facilities, residences for nurses, single doctors, and a small operating room. New York then officially terminated its contract with the Bureau of Immigration and all patients arriving at Ellis Island were treated either in the General Hospital or the Contagious Disease Hospital. 1912 was the first full year that the hospital complex was completely open. = 1912‚Äì1917 = When completed, the Ellis Island Hospital held 750 beds, 450 in the Contagious Disease Hospital and 300 in the General Hospital. A \\"Psychopathic Ward\\" housed 20-30 male and female patients. Island 2 had a maternity ward to deliver the 350 children born at Ellis Island. The maternity/obstetric facilities moved as the hospital expanded, but were first located on the third floor of the Administrative Building on Island 2. The general hospital building held three separate operating rooms and even dental offices. In 1914 when the hospital became fully operational, over 10,000 patients from 75 different countries were treated. The hospitals used the most advanced methods in medicine for the time. In 1912 the PHS installed a full-scale laboratory, an offshoot of their former laboratory on Staten Island. That PHS Lab, and its pioneering work on germs and germ theory, was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1891 and renamed the National Institutes of Health. At the time, the PHS was the premier agency involved in containing infectious diseases. History has rendered a number of these cutting-edge medical practices obsolete, even offensive. For example, now-discredited eugenic beliefs played a small role at the hospital. Dr. Henry H. Goddard established an intelligence testing program on Ellis Island in 1913. Doctors would use metal calipers to measure the circumference of immigrants‚Äô heads, and immigrants of ‚Äúsuperior racial stock‚Äù were often favored when entering the United States. Additionally, many immigrants were detained at Ellis Island for mental illness and placed in the hospital's psychiatric ward. Some of the contemporary clinical classifications for mental illness are now archaic: idiot, imbecile, moron, or feeble-minded. It is likely that many of these diagnoses were the product of cultural differences, language barriers, or the immigrants‚Äô anxiety about entering a new country, which made their behavior seem slow or out of the ordinary to hospital doctors. In 1913, Dr. Howard Andrew Knox developed more objective testing methods to determine with increased accuracy whether an immigrant was mentally deficient. The Knox tests were effective in that they did not require specific cultural knowledge for successful performance. In 1923 The Daughters of the American Revolution provided a robust occupational therapy program for immigrants detained at Ellis Island. In 1936, the PHS was asked to help with the treatment of World War I veterans, some of who were suffering from shell shock. Because of the success of the DAR's occupational expertise, they were given an entire pavilion (Isolation Ward J) where they worked with U.S. servicemen, merchant seamen, and members of the U.S. Coast Guard and other U.S. government beneficiaries. This work continued until after World War II. = World War I: 1917‚Äì1920 = The Hospitals were closed to immigrants for the first two years of World War I because immigration had virtually ceased due to wartime conditions. In 1917 the hospitals were officially taken over by the War Department and were renamed Debarkation Hospital #1. Their wartime mission was to treat wounded soldiers returning from Europe. The hospital was used to near capacity maintaining the same number of medical staff as it had prior to the War. The medical staff were all still commissioned officers in the PHS, but the facility was run by the War Department.Adjutant General Reports 1919, compiled from form 52 Office of the Surgeon General The few immigrants who arrived were treated under contracts by hospitals in New York City. Early in the US involvement in World War I the main facility at Ellis Island was used as an equipping and embarkation facility for the U.S. Navy. Sailors were brought to Ellis Island as they awaited the preparation of their ships for sea.Theatre Magazine 1918 PHS nurses who were being sent to Europe also passed through Ellis Island. They received their equipment and uniforms as well as final training prior to being shipped to hospitals in Europe. Initially quartered at Ellis Island, when the hospitals began to receive military casualties, the nurses were moved to hotels in New York City. Their training continued at Ellis Island. In the spring of 1919 the hospital complex was returned to the Bureau of Immigration and the Public Health Service and was renamed Marine Hospital #43. Immigrants were once again processed at Ellis Island. By 1920 the number of immigrants arriving returned very close to prewar levels and the hospitals were treating similar numbers of patients. = 1920 to 1930 = According to the 1920 US Census, there were 124 PHS employees living on the Islands including seven doctors, two wives and four children. There were 36 nurses residing at Ellis, 24 female,12 male. All the female nurses were single, some of the male nurses were married. There were a total of 35 doctors employed by the Public Health Service serving in 3 divisions: Boarding, Medical Inspection and Hospital. One of the Commissioned doctors was a woman. The hospital treated almost 9,000 patients a year. During the 1920s, however, the US Congress began to change its immigration policy from an Open Door to a very closed door policy. New immigration laws were passed, explicitly to allow some immigration from Northern and Western Europe while severely restricting immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. The ‚ÄúNational Origins Act,‚Äù passed in 1924, established a 2% quota system which drastically reduced immigration from targeted countries. In 1921 over 560,000 immigrants passed through Ellis Island. This drastically reduced overall numbers of immigrants. In 1925, the first full year that the new law was in effect, only 137,000 immigrants were admitted through Ellis Island. Almost overnight the Hospital Complex at Ellis Island held a fraction of the number of immigrant patients it had previously. As the number of immigrants patients decreased the PHS began to use the hospital as a Marine Hospital treating beneficiaries (employees of the US Public Health Service and their families, Merchant Mariners and Coast Guardsmen) as well as immigrants. The Hospital Complex always had the authorization to treat beneficiaries, but because the number of immigrants was so large and because they needed to have the capacity to treat an entire ship load of sick immigrants, the PHS seldom was able to treat beneficiaries. The 1924 National Origins Act further reduced hospital demand by requiring immigrants to have a medical examinations prior to boarding for America. This reduced the need for the Line Inspection at Ellis Island which was very efficient at processing volumes of immigrants but allowed many ill immigrants to enter. The doctors at Ellis Island were able to perform ‚ÄúIntensive Inspections‚Äù which were much longer and more thorough at the Immigration facility. Under the new law the staff at Ellis Island was charged with a new task, inspection of Alien Merchant sailors arriving in New York. This practice started in 1926 and within a few months the PHS doctors were examining sailors at the rate of 600,000 a year. The largest concerns were tuberculosis and venereal disease. In 1919, Ellis Island and its hospitals also served as immigration detentions centers after the US Government conducted the Palmer Raids. The Bureau of Investigation (the forerunner of the FBI) had begun rounding up immigrants across the country who had violated the terms of their admission either by becoming Public Charges, committing crimes or being identified as political dissidents - anarchists principally. These immigrants were called Warrant Cases and were shipped to Ellis Island via Jersey City on Deportation Trains. They were mostly held in secure areas of the main building on Island 1 awaiting deportation. If they were ill, they were taken to the hospitals on Islands 2 and 3. A number of measles wards on Island 3 were converted to secure wards. The 1920 Census records 24 anarchists being treated in the hospitals. = Ellis Island Committee Report = When President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933 Ellis Island was run by the Bureau of Immigration which was part of the Department of Labor. The facilities at Ellis Island were in such bad shape that President Roosevelt instructed the Secretary of Labor, Francis Perkins, to convene the Ellis Island Committee. Their mission was to evaluate the state of the facilities, to assess current immigration policy and to recommend actions to solve the problems that they identified. In 1934 the Ellis Island Committee submitted a report to Secretary Perkins confirming that current facilities were in disrepair and they were not adequate to fulfill the therapeutic and recreational needs of the patients. The Roosevelt Administration acted on many of the recommendations. The projects that were completed on Islands 2 and 3 included: Completing and landscaping the infill of the area between Islands 2 and 3, for recreational and therapeutic use; adding a recreation shelter for the new lawn space; and construction of a Recreation Building. The Recreation Building replaced the Red Cross building which had been added in 1915, adjacent to Hospital Outbuilding and the corridor to the Ferry. It was a wooden structure that was too small and, by 1934, in very poor condition. The Recreation building was the largest new structure built. Constructed between Islands 2 and 3, it housed a full scale gymnasium and auditorium complete with stage, a film projection booth, a canteen and other recreational facilities. The Surgeon‚Äôs house on Island 2 which had become a nurses residence was removed. The Surgeons and their families lived the Staff House on Island 3 and the nurses quarters were all moved the Administrative building on Island 3. In addition to the new structures, extensive work was done on the Contagious Disease Hospital. Metal doors were added in the psychiatric wards. There were two maximum security psychiatric wards created by remodeling 2 measles wards, one for women and one for men. Specialized plumbing was added to the Tuberculosis wards. Much of the extant structures seen today are the result of these renovations. The work was performed between 1934 and by the end of 1936 by two New Deal programs within the Department of Labor: the Public Works Administration and the New Deal of the Works Progress Administration. The conversion of the wards and other work was also done by these two agencies.NARA record group 79  After closure  In 1954, the remaining parts of Ellis Island were closed and declared ‚Äúexcess federal property‚Äù. Despite redevelopment of Ellis Island's north side, the south side remained abandoned because of disagreements over its proposed use. The NPS held a competition for proposals to redevelop the south side in 1981. The NPS selected a plan for a conference center and a 250-to-300-room Sheraton hotel on the site of the hospital. In 1985, while restoration of the north side of Ellis Island was underway, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel convened a long-inactive federal commission to determine how the south side of Ellis Island should be used. Though the hotel proposal was dropped in 1986 for lack of funds, the NPS allowed developer William Hubbard to redevelop the south side as a convention center, though Hubbard was not able to find investors. The south side was proposed for possible future development even through the late 1990s. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund listed the hospital as one of the world's 100 Most Endangered Properties, a warning echoed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which put the buildings on the list of ‚Äúmost endangered historical places in the United States.‚Äù A study conducted by the New York Landmarks Conservancy estimated that with about $3 million of federal funding, the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital could be stabilized for the next 15 years. According to the Conservancy, that would allow time to develop a long-term preservation plan.  Architecture  The lawn between islands 2 and 3. General hospital buildings on island 2 seen on the left. The present day footprint of the island is as opposed to the original island. Though the current island's landmass was originally three separate islands, the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital consisted of 22 buildings spread over the southern two islands. The islands were man-made, using excavated fill and concrete from the New York City Subway, as well as other building demolition spoils. The fill was retained with a system of wood piles and cribbing, and later encased with more than 7,700 linear feet of concrete and granite sea wall, placed atop either wood piles, cribbing, or submerged bags of concrete. Island 2 was created in 1899, and island 3 in 1906. The second ferry basin between islands 2 and 3 was infilled in the 1920s to create the great lawn. It was started by building the concrete and granite seawall to connect the tip of islands 2 and 3. The basin was subsequently filled to create the lawn. A central corridor runs southward from the ferry building on the west side of the island. Two additional corridors split eastward down the centers of islands 2 and 3. During its peak years, the hospital employed over 150 doctors, nurses, and other staff, many of whom lived in dormitories on the islands. According to the 1920 Census, 124 lived on the Islands. Red Cross workers also volunteered frequently, with a special focus on making the hospital more comfortable and enjoyable for the immigrant children. A hospital school taught children about personal hygiene, neatness, and good manners. General hospital A south- facing porch of the psychopathic ward with the cage The main building of the general hospital originally consisted of 125 beds and was eventually expanded to 300. Original concepts for the hospital included a rooftop bistro-style sitting and recreational area. With the Administration Building and Hospital Extension, the general hospital comprised four operating rooms, a women's ward, a pediatric ward, a maternity ward, and a psychiatric ward. It was equipped with two birdcage elevators. Wards were open, and had lots of windows for ventilation and natural light. Each ward was also provided with a south- facing porch for fresh air, and activity. The operating rooms were located on the third floor and had skylights in order to provide the best lighting possible. Supplemental lighting was provided via I.P. Frink. The structures on Island 2 shared the same design as the original facilities on island 1: a brick facade in Flemish bond, quoins, and limestone ornamentation. All structures were internally connected via covered passageways. A Smith Drum machine in the outbuilding Along the central corridor connecting the islands, (on Island 2, just south of the ferry terminal) is the Laundry Building, which was constructed in 1900-1901 along with the now-demolished surgeon's house. The structure is one and a half stories tall with a hip roof and skylights facing to the north and south. Repaired repeatedly throughout its history, the laundry-outbuilding was last restored in 2002. It had linen, laundry, and disinfecting rooms; a boiler room; a morgue with autopsy room; and quarters for the laundry staff on the second floor. To the east of the Laundry Building , on island 2 is the psychopathic ward, a two-story building erected in 1906‚Äì1907. This building is the only structure in the hospital complex to have a flat roof, and it previously also had a porch to its south. It housed 25 to 30 beds and was intended for the temporary treatment of immigrants suspected of being insane or having mental disorders, pending their deportation, hospitalization, or commitment to sanatoria. Male and female patients were segregated, and there were also a dayroom, veranda, nurse's office, and small pantry on each floor. In 1952 the psychopathic ward was converted into a Coast Guard brig. The main General Hospital building is directly east of the psychopathic ward. It is composed of three similarly designed structures: from west to east, they are Hospital Building No. 1 (built 1900-1901), the Administration Building (1905-1907), and Hospital Building No. 2 (1908-1909). The 3.5-story building no. 1 is shaped like an inverted \\"C\\" with two 2.5-story rectangular wings facing southward; the wings contain two-story-tall porches. The administration building is smaller but also 3.5 stories. The 3.5-story building no. 2 is similar to building no. 1, but also has a three-story porch at the south elevation of the central pavilion. All three buildings have stone-stoop entrances on their north facades and courtyards on their south. Contagious disease hospital On Island 3, the contagious disease hospital comprised eight separate two-story pavilions, an administration building, and a kitchen all connected by a center and three completely separated isolation pavilions extending along the same corridor axis. The 16 measles wards, (also known as ward A-H) were built in phases from 1906 to 1909. In sequence, the two-story pavilions were arranged with four pavilions each to the west and east of island 3's administration building and the kitchen building. Wards A, B, E and F were located south of the connection corridor; wards C, D, G, H, to the north of corridor. Each of these pavilions held all the necessary service spaces to function independently, and each ward could be sealed off in order to prevent cross-contamination, the principal cause of death prior to the invention of antibiotics . Most of the structures were completed in 1911. The three isolation wards were located along the axis of the corridor but beyond the limits of its enclosure. Each contained two separate wards. The power house/sterilizer/autopsy theater, mortuary, laboratory/pharmacy building were located at the southwest end of the connecting corridor and the Staff House at the Northeast end. The kitchen building and Administrative building, which also was dormitory for the nurses, were located in the center of the corridor. All structures were designed by James Knox Taylor in the Italian Renaissance style and are distinguished by red-tiled hip roofs, exposed rafter tails, roughcast or pebble dashed walls of stucco, and ornamentation of brick and limestone. Several design features of the hospital were specifically intended to help contain the diseases. The laundry facility was equipped with a large steam-heated autoclave to sanitize mattresses. In Tuberculosis Wards, each patient room had two sinks. The higher sink was used for spitting and the lower sink was for washing. The autopsy amphitheater which contained an eight- cadaver refrigerator, became a well-known teaching hall, drawing medical observers from teaching hospitals in the United States and Europe. Eventually, the hospital boasted 22 wards, including separate wards for men, women, children, surgery patients, and the insane. =Structures= Exterior of the contagious disease hospital The Office Building and Laboratory is a 2.5-story structure located at the west end of island 3. It housed doctors' offices and a dispensary on the first floor, along with a laboratory and pharmacists' quarters on the second floor. In 1924, the first floor offices were converted into male nurses' quarters. A one-story morgue is located east of the office building, and was converted to the \\"Animal House\\" circa 1919. An \\"L\\"-shaped powerhouse and laundry building, built in 1908, is also located on the west side of island 3. It has a square north wing with boiler, coal, and pump rooms, as well as a rectangular south wing with laundry and disinfection rooms, staff kitchen, and staff pantry. The powerhouse and laundry also had a distinctive yellow-brick smokestack. Part of the building was converted into a morgue and autopsy room in the 1930s. To the east are the eight measles pavilions. All of the pavilions are identical, two-story rectangular structures. Each pavilion held a spacious open ward with large windows on three sides and independent ventilation ducts. A hall leading to the connecting corridor was flanked by bathrooms, nurses' duty room, offices, and a serving kitchen. The administration building for the Contagious Disease Hospital is a 3.5-story structure located on the north side of island 3's connecting corridor, in the center of the landmass. It included reception rooms, offices, and a staff kitchen on the first floor; nurses' quarters and operating rooms on the second floor; and additional staff quarters on the third floor. A one-story kitchen with a smokestack is located opposite the administration building to the south. At the extreme eastern end of island three were three separate isolation pavilions, which contained (wards I-L) and a staff house. These pavilions were intended for patients suffering from more serious infectious diseases, including scarlet fever, diphtheria, and a combination of either of these diseases with measles and whooping cough. Each pavilion was a 1.5-story rectangular structure. Wards I and K are located to the south of the connecting corridor while ward L is located to the north; originally, all three pavilions were freestanding structures, but covered ways were built between wards I and K and the center corridor in 1914. There were also nurses' quarters in each attic. The staff building. located at the extreme east end of island 3's connecting corridor, is a 2.5-story building for high-ranking hospital staff. Living and dining rooms, a kitchen, and a library were located on the first floor while bedrooms were located on the second floor.

In 2014, the hospital opened to the public for guided 90-minute \\"Hard-Hat Tours\\". The Hard-Hat Tour ticket requires an additional fee on top of the regular ferry ticket. The additional fee revenues help fund the preservation of the south side. However, all tourists are required to stay with their tour groups and wear hard hats, and videos of the site are prohibited without prior approval. In media A mural from \\"Unframed - Ellis Island In 2014, \\"Unframed ‚Äì Ellis Island\\", an art installation by the French street artist JR, was installed. The work can be seen as part of the Hard-Hat Tour and includes murals of figures who would have occupied each of the respective hospital buildings. Forgotten Ellis Island, a documentary by Lorie Conway, explores the abandoned buildings on the island and covers the history of the hospital. Conway also tracked down immigrants and descendants of immigrants who had spent time in the hospital and discussed their experiences with them. The film premiered on Ellis Island and was later shown on CBS in 2007. On October 29, 2019, The Today Show aired a piece on the Immigrant Hospitals titled \\"Al Roker gets a tour of the abandoned Ellis Island hospitals.\\" See also * Hoffman Island * Jersey City Reservoir No. 3 * Ellis, 2015 film References  Notes   Bibliography  # # # # # # ## ## ## Further reading Ellis Island Opens Ellis Island History of immigration to the United States History of New York City Defunct hospitals in New York City Hospitals in Hudson County, New Jersey Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Buildings and structures in Jersey City, New Jersey Government buildings in New York City Tourist attractions in Hudson County, New Jersey Historic American Buildings Survey in New Jersey Historic district contributing properties in New Jersey National Register of Historic Places in Hudson County, New Jersey Hospital buildings completed in 1902 Hospitals established in 1902 Hospitals disestablished in 1930 Defunct hospitals in New Jersey Historic district contributing properties in New York (state) Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey United States Public Health Service Hospitals ","title":"Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital"},{"id":"34195003","text":"Phaeochoraceae is a family of sac fungi in the order Phyllachorales.

The company has 130 offices in India, with offices in Dubai, Sri Lanka, United States and Malaysia to cater to its customers beyond India. Bharat matrimony came into existence after Murugavel decided to launch an online platform to get connected to his Tamil community and after the successful engagement of that application for initiating lost communication with family and friends, he comes up with online matrimony business model- BharatMatrimony. History Murugavel Janakiraman started the BharatMatrimony website in 2000 while working as a software consultant for Lucent Technologies in Edison, N.J. In the late 1990s he set up a Tamil community web portal, which included matrimonial ads. He started BharatMatrimony after noticing the matrimonial ads generated most of his web traffic. He returned to India in 2004. Back in the early 2000s, when there was skepticism about online matrimony and fear about paying online, the company pioneered doorstep collections in India. The company introduced features on their website like Matchboard, SoulMate Search, AstroMatch, and Express Interest to help customers make the right matches. BharatMatrimony has mobile apps for iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, Nokia and Android users in India. It also has an upgraded WAP site. Anand Bhushan was hired by BharatMatrimony on a retainer basis. Assisted Matrimony is a personalized match making service offered for busy professionals. In 2006, the website earned into the Limca Book of World Records for having facilitated the highest number of documented marriages online in India, a number that has since reached one million marriages. In 2009, BharatMatrimony launched more than 200 community portals, aimed at specific language groups and communities. The company launched more portals in 2010 aimed at Malaysian and Singaporean Tamils. BharatMatrimony operated in more than 14 regional languages. Another portal was aimed at defence personnel.

Development The Gallaudet Hydroplane was built in Norwich, Connecticut by Edson Fessenden Gallaudet. The principle of wing-warping was independently applied to this kite/aircraft/glider several years before the Wright Brothers applied it to their Wright Flyer. (along with Jean-Marie LeBris, John J. Montgomery, Clement Ader, D.D. Wells, and Hugo Mattullath).Harwood, Craig S. and Fogel, Gary B. Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West, University of Oklahoma Press 2012. The Wrights later applied for a patent on wing-warping, which led to the widespread use of the aileron control method to avoid the Wright's airplane patents. Gallaudet generically employed the name hydroplane to many of his future seaplane designs. In 1908, Gallaudet would form the Gallaudet Engineering Company, (later the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation). Later hydroplane models were built for the United States Navy. Design The 1897 Gallaudet Hydroplane glider featured twin floats, a central pyramidal support frame, and flexible wooden wing ribs (employing wing warping) with fabric-covering. In 1913, Gallaudet filed U.S. Patent# 1,214,536 for the Hydroplane. The single-place open cockpit aircraft featured most of the engine enclosed in the fuselage. The fuselage tapered upwards to the rear with a small attached rudder. A single landing wheel protruded partially from the center of the fuselage for ground landings. Operational history The Gallaudet Hydroplane was on display at the East Hall of the Arts and Industries Building of the Smithsonian Museum. Test flights for later hydroplanes built for U.S. Navy acceptance were performed at Gales Ferry, Connecticut in 1916.

Assassination  In the evening of 5 November 1990, Kahane gave a speech in the second-floor lecture hall of a Marriott Hotel, in Manhattan, at 525 Lexington Avenue, to an audience, most of whom were Orthodox Jews. After his speech, a crowd of well-wishers gathered around Kahane as he answered questions. Shortly after 9:00 p.m., a man disguised as an Orthodox Jew approached Kahane and shot him from close range with a .357 caliber pistol.Kahane Is Killed After Giving Talk In New York Hotel ‚Äì New York Times Kahane was hit in the neck by the gunfire and died of his wounds shortly thereafter.Katz, Samuel M. \\"Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the manhunt for the al-Qaeda terrorists\\", 2002Hamm, Mark S (2007). Terrorism as Crime: From Oklahoma City to Al-Qaeda and Beyond. NYU Press, p. 29 After shooting Kahane, the assassin fled from the hotel and reached Lexington Avenue, where, in front of a post office, he attempted to take over a taxi at gunpoint. Carlos Acosta, an on-duty postal police officer, drew his pistol and ordered the assassin to freeze. Instead, the assassin turned toward the officer and shot and hit him in the chest. The officer returned fire, hitting the assassin in the chin. Afterwards, the officer arrested the man. Born in Egypt, he was the American citizen El Sayyid Nosair, who had been living in Jersey City.  Prosecution of Nosair  Nosair was charged with the murder of Kahane. During the legal proceedings, Nosair denied all charges against him. Although there were witnesses who identified Nosair as the assassin, Nosair was not convicted of Kahane's assassination, in part because Kahane's family had opposed the performing of an autopsy after the assassination and the extracting of the bullets. However, Nosair was convicted of assault, possession of an illegal firearm, and of shooting a US Postal Inspection Service agent. Nosair was sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment, the maximum allowed.Judge Gives Maximum Term in Kahane Case, The New York Times, 30 January 1992  Conspiracy to free Nosair from prison  Nosair was to serve his sentence in the Attica State Prison, in New York. In 1993, Sheik Omar Abdul-Rahman was arrested in New York. An investigation later revealed that a terrorist cell, led by Abdul- Rahman, conducted detailed surveillance of the Attica State Prison facilities and that it had discussed plans to use a truck bomb attack, combined with an armed assault, to rescue Nosair from prison.The Destruction of Sarposa by Fred Burton and Scott Stewart, Strategic Forecasting (Stratfor) 18 June 2008 (retrieved on 1 October 2008).  Nosair's conviction of activity in a terrorist cell  The investigation of Abdul-Rahman showed that Nosair belonged to the terrorist cell. It was led by Abdul-Rahman who later tried to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993 by using an explosive-laden vehicle. This time, Nosair was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, plus 15 years. It was decided that because Kahane's death was part of the total \\"seditious conspiracy,\\" Nosair could be convicted of killing Kahane.

History From 1878, the railway route from Kolkata, then called Calcutta, to Siliguri was in two laps. The first lap was a 185 km journey along the Eastern Bengal State Railway from Calcutta Station (later renamed Sealdah) to Damookdeah Ghat on the southern bank of the Padma River, then across the river in a ferry and the second lap of the journey. A 336 km metre gauge line of the North Bengal Railway linked Saraghat on the northern bank of the Padma to Siliguri. The Kolkata-Siliguri main line was converted to broad gauge in stages. The Shakole-Santahar section was converted in 1910‚Äì1914, when Hardinge Bridge was under construction. The Hardinge Bridge was opened in 1915 and the Santahar-Parbatipur section was converted in 1924. The journey to Kolkata from Hili was only eight hours prior to 1947. During partition of India, the India-Pakistan border ran through Hili town, with around three fourths of the town in East Pakistan, later Bangladesh.

Built in 1938 to store and supply naval mines and munitions ordance to the Royal Navy, at its height during the cold war 400 permanent workers were deployed at the site, housed in an MoD built town infrastructure. The site had an on-site, narrow gauge railway, built using copper to reduce sparks. The weapons were both delivered to the site and then distributed using standard gauge rail to Fishguard, Neyland for Milford Haven, and latterly Pembroke Dock. Decommissioned in 1992, all 58 cavern storage bunkers and the extensive above ground network of storage sheds and other military buildings remain in place. Ownership of the site was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to Anglo-Irish consortium Omega Pacific in 1998, and then by court order to the Manhattan Loft Corporation in 2002. The site is being redeveloped as an industrial park. Construction View north towards the Trecwn valley, showing the highly protected nature of the site Security fence surrounds the entire site of the former RNAD Trecwn MoD built houses for workers at RNAD Trecwn The former Barham Primary school, used by RNAD Trecwn workers' children Located on the former North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway, south of Fishguard, construction was commenced in 1938. Its location allowed supply of naval mines and munitions via rail from the West Wales Lines Fishguard branch, and distribution via a series of local deep sea ports, including Fishguard harbour and Neyland for Milford Haven. As with all munitions depots, safety and particularly planning for explosion prevention and firefighting was a major priority at the depot. The site used a specific design of gauge for on- site distribution to minimise manual handling. For fire fighting two reservoirs are built into the hillside on opposite sides of the valley to supply high-pressure water to the onsite fire hydrants, which are located both within each of the 58 storage chambers and alongside each surface building. Due to its scale and location, the MoD built a whole new infrastructure around the existing village to support the depot, with workers transported in, due to the remote location. This included three separate housing estates (still occupied today), and a waste water treatment plant. Nearby Barham Memorial School (built in 1877 with funding from the Barham family, and a Grade II listed building), closed in 2001 due to falling registers after the RNAD closed. Layout and operations Surface buildings at the former RNAD Trecwn The depot has a traditional herringbone layout along the valley, giving access to 58 cavern-based storage chambers, each approximately in length, which have been hewn into the rock of the valley sides. Each cavern storage chamber can be accessed either via road, standard gauge rail or the site's own narrow gauge railway. Munitions would be brought onto site mainly via standard gauge rail, and then distributed onsite using the specifically designed narrow gauge railway. Road access was mainly used for non-explosive access such as for workers and contractors, although it was occasionally used for supply and distribution. Distribution was via standard gauge rail using either Great Western Railway or British Railways locomotives hauling MoD/Royal Navy private owner wagons directly to Fishguard harbour, or Neyland for Milford Haven. After the closure of the RNAD sub-depot at Pembroke Dock, the Trecwn site gained additional workers and a longer distribution chain. At this high point of operations during the cold war, it employed up to 400 direct workers. Transport access Purposefully located on the former North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway, it gave the site easy access to excellent rail distribution. Direct passenger access was also provided by rail, with workmen's trains reversing in from the Fishguard and Goodwick railway station until 1 August 1964. Standard gauge Just south of the main entrance and main security fence stands a single railway platform, for workers access to the site. Within the security fence, the marshalling yard of 8 parallel loops exists, formerly shunted by a dedicated MoD diesel hydraulic shunting locomotive. The line then extends down the valley, through a gauge exchange shed for access to the narrow gauge infrastructure, and then provides direct access to the 58 cavern storage chambers via a series of herring-bone shaped sidings. Supply trains would run from the site to both Fishguard harbour, Neyland for Milford Haven, and Pembroke Dock. At Fishguard the line extended beyond the ferry terminal at Fishguard Harbour railway station, continuing along the breakwater to a single line spur, allowing for transfer of munitions to Royal Navy ships. Narrow gauge Body of former RNAD Trecwn narrow gauge Baguley-Drewry diesel hydraulic locomotive T 009 00 NZ 35(works number 3781) at Tywyn Wharf on the Talyllyn Railway A gauge line traverses the entire site, with direct access to the 58 cavern storage chambers. All rail infrastructure was built in copper to reduce the risk of sparks. Serviced via its own on-site locomotive shed and works, the line was equipped with a series of specially provided wooden enclosed wagons, with sliding roof covers. This allowed sea mines and other munitions to be directly placed within the wagons from overhead gantries, and transported over the entire site without access via any form of side door, hence enhancing safety. The narrow gauge line therefore became the main method of on-site distribution, with standard gauge rail or road the off site access method. Road Connected to the A40 road via a private access road, the link gave access to both workers, suppliers and the occasional munitions delivery and distribution. Sale, current use Rail access still in place in 2006 to the former RNAD Trecwn In the early 1990s, Trecwn was placed on care and maintenance by the MoD. The entire site was sold to Anglo-Irish consortium Omega Pacific in 1998 for ¬£329,000, with a stated intention of using the surface buildings for aircraft engine maintenance, while the caverns would be used for the storage of low-level nuclear waste. However, a lack of planning consent (noise of the engines, level of radiation), and local opposition meant that the company ended up in court in 2002, and was ordered to sell the site to the Manhattan Loft Corporation, in conjunction with property developer Richard Harrington, within 10 weeks. The Manhattan Loft Corporation intend to develop the site as a multi-use industrial estate, with the surface buildings rented or leased for light industrial purposes, and the caverns for storage and distribution. Network Rail have not only kept the railway connection operational, but refurbished it to allow the site to develop as an Intermodal freight traffic distribution site from Fishguard. All of the narrow gauge infrastructure and stock has been removed. Some stock has been transferred to the similarly gauged Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, and other items to the Talyllyn Railway and the Welsh Highland Heritage Railway. The site was used as the filming location for the 2015 Channel 4 series \\"SAS:Who Dares Wins\\". In late 2011, Renewable Developments Wales applied for planning permission to build a diesel-powered peaking plant on of land close to the former main entrance. The plan was to produce 20MW of electricity using 11 generators, each stored within its own soundproof container. Plans submitted by The Valley (Pembrokeshire) Ltd to build a 25-megawatt biomass energy plant on the site were conditionally approved in 2015, subject to an environmental permit from Natural Resources Wales (NRW), but by August 2018 work, with the promise of 40 jobs, had not been started by current owners Manhattan Loft Corporation, leading to questions by the local councillor.

Those who belong to the ant tribe class hope that, in time, they will find the jobs for which they were trained in college. Lian Si (), then a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University, coined the term \\"ant tribe\\" to draw a comparison between the lives of these college graduates and ants: \\"They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in cramped areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet anonymous and underpaid.\\"\\"China's 'ant tribe' still struggling.\\" China Daily. December 14, 2010. Typically consisting of those born during and after the 1980s, the ant tribe is considered the fourth disadvantaged social class in the Chinese social paradigm, alongside the traditionally disadvantaged classes of the peasantry, the migrant workers, and those formerly employed by government-owned corporations and left unemployed by the economic reform in China. A Chinese paradigm  Background After reading \\"The Down Youth\\" (), an article in China Newsweek about the difficult living conditions of college graduates born in the 1980s, the PKU social scientist Lian Si began to research the living conditions of college graduates. Lian found that there was a similarity between the hard-working, smart and \\"stuck on the ground\\" ants and the struggling crowds of city- dwelling college graduates. This led Lian to coin the viral phrase \\"ant tribe\\".Xiao, Zhang. (January 5, 2011). \\"Ant Tribe leader marches forward.\\" China Daily. Retrieved December 27, 2011.Yao, Li.

The college graduates, with degrees in economics, engineering, management and medicine, and based upon a seven-city survey are earning on average US$286 (CNY 1,904) a month as reported in 2010. The 2010 Annual Report on the Development of Chinese Talent, which reports the results of another survey, estimates that there are 1 million people who fit the definition of ant tribe members living in slum conditions. A key characteristic of the ant tribe is their optimism. After completing their college education, the young people often seek to stay in urban areas to maximize their career prospects. As a result, they accept the short-term consequences of starting-level positions for which they are over-qualified, believing that they will rise to their desired job level in time. There's a correlation between the prestige of one's degree and the size of the city that they hope to eventually stay in. Students from the best colleges generally flock to big cities, while students who have only completed vocational training are more likely to vie for positions in smaller cities.'\\"Ant tribe\\" grows bigger.' China Daily. December 20, 2010. Retrieved December 27, 2011. To control costs, ant tribe people are likely to rent small rooms or share a crowded small apartment in the city slums. Accommodations are often spartan: little furniture and no air conditioning, even as the temperatures in the major cities of China frequently exceed 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C). Some ant tribe dwellings have no window and many utilize a shared bath, unless their owners are able and willing to shoulder the costs for a private bath.'China's young college grads toil in \\"ant tribes\\"' China Daily.

These apartments, while located in the major cities of China and host college-educated people, are noted to resemble slums in third-world countries.  Factors  Some of the factors that made the plights of the ant tribe possible and difficult to surmount in China are: =General economic and market factors= Rising housing costs, as much as 33% increase over recent years and a 9.5% increase from 2009 to 2010, have made it very difficult to find affordable housing. Successful programs to recruit college students has resulted in a large number of individuals seeking professional positions. In 1998 the program to build the number of professionals saw the successful number of graduates reach 830,000. The number rose to 6 million by May, 2009. However, there were no reciprocal programs to ensure that professional positions would be available for these new graduates.Jacobs, Andrew.

Retrieved December 27, 2011. =Education reform= In 1996, China began expanding university enrollment to meet growing demands of educated laborers, which contributed to the deflation of the undergraduate degree. Excessive enrollment and ignorance of professional training skills massively inflated the raw number of college graduates, while the market demanded more technical laborers. As a result, the skill set of Chinese college graduates became undesirable to the growing market. =Wages= Wages in many positions have been cut between 50‚Äì100% in large cities because of the large number of people entering the job markets there, making wages lower than factory workers. Regarding alternative temporary jobs, these young adults may accept jobs where their wage is subject to aggressive sales quotas that, if unmet, lowers their actual wage. Wages for professional positions has not seen a substantial change up or down. Consequently, even if the ant tribe people eventually attain their desired job level, these jobs would worth even less due to increases in the cost of living. Due to the structure of China's economy, the demand for uneducated manual laborers to work in manufacturing has soared, resulting in an up to an 80% increase in pay over the six-year period between 2003 and 2009. =Socio- economic factors= Most of the ant tribe come from rural or less developed districts, and many are raised in uneducated agricultural families. Graduates who come from a rural background may not have the social skills and connections (\\"guanxi\\") important in building a successful career. People who have migrated into the city are not eligible for government supported programs, such as social welfare benefits and subsidized housing. Traditionally, those who have migrated from rural towns to the cities consider it shameful to seek work in their hometown. Often, their parents have endured significant hardship to support the student through college and placed hopes of attaining a higher living standard in the cities upon those college graduates. To many in the ant tribe, it is preferable to stay in the city regardless of the living and working conditions, even if many of them cannot even afford to travel home during Chinese New Year, traditionally a time for family reunion. As of 2012, the 80s generation are approaching the age when they are socially pressured to marry and to have children, which requires even better living conditions.Looking at city \\"ant tribes\\" is the starting point to solve the problem.

Following their review, a plan was developed by the local government to improve the ant tribe's living conditions.

To them, living in a large city means living a poor life due to the higher cost of living. There may be a general trend for young people to move to smaller and mid-sized cities as Chinese companies relocate to those areas from the larger cities to control their costs.Hongyi, Wang.

Alam; ), was a Pakistani theoretical physicist and professor of mathematics at the Quaid-e-Azam University. Alam is best known for conceiving and embarking on research on the gas centrifuge during Pakistan's integrated atomic bomb project in the 1970s, and he also conceived the research on charge density, nuclear fission, and gamma-ray bursts throughout his career. After the atomic bomb project, Alam joined the Department of Mathematics at the Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) as well as serving as visiting faculty at the Institute of Physics, and co-authored papers on variation calculus and fission isomer. He was one of the notable theoretical physicists at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and QAU. At one point, his fellow theorist, Munir Ahmad Khan, called Alam \\"the problem solving brain of the PAEC\\". Biography Alam was educated at the Government College University in Lahore where he studied in 1951 and graduated with Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Mathematics in 1955 under the supervision of Abdus Salam‚Äìa theoretical physicist. He then went to attend the physics program at the Punjab University where he graduated with Master of Science (MSc) in Physics in 1957, supervised under Dr. Rafi Muhammad‚Äì a nuclear physicist. His thesis titled: The Emission of Electromagnetic Radiations from metals by high energy particles, had contained investigations on electromagnetic radiation emitted from the heavy metals by bombarding the elementary particles.N. M. Butt, ‚ÄúNuclear Radiation Education and Nuclear Science and Technology in Pakistan,‚Äù paper presented to the 2nd International Congress on Radiation Education in Debrecen, Hungary In 1964, Alam joined the doctoral program in physics at the University College London (UCL) under the Colombo Plan Scholarship, initially joining the doctoral group led by British physicist, John B. Hasted. He learned the course on atomic physics under Harrie Massey and worked on experimental physics under J.B. Hasted. In 1967, he submitted his doctoral thesis supervised by Dr. J.B. Hasted which he defended successfully and graduated with Doctor of Philosophy in theoretical physics. His doctoral thesis, titled: Electron Capture by Multiply Charged Ions, provided scientific investigations on charge-crossing involving potential curve crossing, a concept in quantum mechanics. In 1967, he published another thesis jointly written by J.B. Hasted and D.K. Bohme on physics of atomic collision and potential energy curves‚Äî their work was supported and funded by the United States Department of Defense. While in the United Kingdom, Alam continued publishing and working on the atomic physics and atomic collisions, collaborating with many other of his British colleagues. However, Alam lost interests in atomic physics and became interested in computer programming and mathematics. In 1970, he published a paper on gamma rays and performed an experiment on isomers, proposing and later proving mathematically that, in the isomer state, the average kinetic energy associated with the decay process of Isomer state is about the same in the ground state of fission. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission 1971 war, atomic bomb program, and centrifuge technology In 1958, Alam joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission as a researcher, and was directed to join the Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH), the national laboratory site in Nilore, in 1970. During the war with India in 1971, Alam became interested in computing and mathematics, briefly writing a computer program while working in problems relating to logic and the mathematics. Alam was instrumental in establishing the computer department at the Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology before moving to join the Physics Division. Alam originally was not part of the team that was investigating the uranium enrichment under Bashiruddin Mahmood in 1974 and had not seen a gas centrifuge albeit of rudimentary knowledge from the work done by Jesse Beams, an American, in 1940s. In 1974‚Äì76, Alam directed a separate electromagnetic separation program at the Airport Development Works setup at the Chaklala Air Force Base and begin working on the applications of magnetism and magnetic bearing. Eventually other physicists such as Fakhr Hashmi, Javed Arshad Mirza, Eqbal Ahmad Khokhar, and Anwar Ali joined his Airport Development Works facility‚Äî thus forming the centrifuge program under Alam. In 1976, Alam was asked to review the components and the blueprints of a gas centrifuge brought by Abdul Qadeer Khan for analysis, which he later identified as incorrect and incomplete to the PAEC. During this time, he held discussion with Abdul Qadeer Khan on copper metallurgy which was nascent to his development of centrifuge at the Airport Development Works facility. Meanwhile, Alam accepted and joined the faculty of mathematics at the Quaid-e-Azam University and met with Tasneem Shah, an Oxford University PhD graduate in mathematics, degelating Shah to join the centrifuge program. Alam and Shah performed mathematical calculations for linearly approximating the reasonable percent error for the actual value of military-grade uranium that proved the Abdul Qadeer Khan's estimation required to enriched the uranium. In April 1976, Alam succeeded in designing a gas centrifuge and succeeded in rotating the first centrifuge to 30,000 rpm by perfectly balancing and rotating around fixed axis of the centrifuge‚Äî Alam and his team was immediately dispatched at the Khan Research Laboratories under Abdul Qadeer Khan. At KRL, Alam and Shah worked on solving differential equation problems relating the gas centrifuges, and designed a first generation of centrifuges, known as P1, that succeeded in separating the U234, U235, and U238 isotopes from raw natural uranium under supervision of Shah, Alam, and Qadeer Khan. Commenting on the success, Alam famously quoted: \\"Boys, we have achieved enrichment in Pakistan.\\" Following this success, Alam and other colleagues signed and quickly published a paper on the differential methods of the centrifuges in 1978‚Äì79. Alam remained associated with the centrifuge program and was its design director until 1981 when he developed intellectual differences with Abdul Qadeer Khan in 1981. He was confided by Abdul Qadeer Khan about selling the centrifuge technology to unknown Arab country, which he vehemently opposed the idea on the ground that India (a competitor in that field) might be benefited from that technology.

Alam, interview in Assas-o-Lashkar (Urdu), June 12, 1998 After this incident, Alam was transferred to PAEC where he remained associated with the electromagnetic separation program under Dr. Shaukat Hameed Khan, and decided to work on the partial differential equations. Alam went to join the Quaid-i- Azam University and briefly taught courses on calculus, and published a computer model on HIV rate of infection along with American scientists. At the Department of Mathematics, Alam pioneered a paper in Gamma-ray bursts using mathematical descriptions to analyse the energy released by the gamma rays.

The band's line-up is Ryan Lynch (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Hannah Hunt (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Connors (bass guitar), Garett Goddard (guitar) and Rene Solomon (drums, percussion). Dominant Legs released an extended play (EP), Young At Love and Life, in 2010 and a full- length album, Invitation, in 2011. History Ryan Lynch, formerly of Magic Bullets and Girls, started Dominant Legs in 2008. According to Lynch, the band's name means \\"sexy legs\\" and came about while he was skinny dipping in Newport Beach. He used the term to describe the legs of Corey Cunningham of the band Terry Malts.  Lynch released two demo tracks late in 2009 and was named a \\"band to watch\\" by Stereogum. Lynch met the keyboard player and vocalist Hannah Hunt through mutual friends and the pair soon started performing together. Hunt was the inspiration behind the Vampire Weekend song \\"Hannah Hunt\\" from their third album Modern Vampires of the City. The Young At Love and Life EP was released in August 2010.   Following the EP's release, the band's line-up expanded with the additions of Rene Solomon (drums), Garett Goddard (guitar) and Andrew Connors (bass guitar). The music video for the song \\"Hoop of Love\\" was premiered in August 2011; The group's first album, Invitation, was released one month later.

It is dedicated to the memory of the violinist John Tunnell, who had been leader of the orchestra, and was premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on a BBC Promenade Concert on 10 September 1989, with the composer conducting the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Character and materials The Fourth Symphony differs from its predecessors in several respects, but particularly for combining the conventional four movements into a single unit, similar to Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1, op. 9, only on a larger scale . On the other hand, like Davies‚Äôs earlier symphonies, the symphony stems from a mixture of a plainchant source on the one hand, and a moment in the composer's personal experience on the other . The plainchant \\"Adorna thalamum tuum, Sion\\", for a Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary (a processional chant with candles) is transformed by the composer into different but related sets of seven, nine, and ten notes, which are used as the basic pitch materials of the symphony . Such transformational treatment of plainchant melodies has been a characteristic of Davies's music since the 1957 sextet Alma Redemptoris Mater . The second source was the haunting sight of a golden eagle taking flight at sunrise, which the composer did not attempt to portray literally . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for a scaled-down orchestra of two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo and alto flute), two oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), two clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling double bassoon), two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings. These forces reflect Davies's exploration at that time especially of the symphonies of Haydn and Mozart, in his capacity as associate conductor of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra . Analysis The symphony is in four movements, though they are played without break: # Moderato # Allegro # Adagio # Andante ‚Äì Allegro The symphony begins with a sort of \\"ghost sonata\\" with a disguised recapitulation . A short Adagio transition at the end seems to be preparing for a following slow movement, a forecast contradicted by the actual nature of the second movement‚Äîa musical trompe-l'oeil or \\"contradictory anticipation\\" (; ). It is the first of a series of \\"one-sided parentheses\\" refracting the structure toward a series of three short, concentrated statements at the very end of the symphony (; ). The second movement unexpectedly proves to be a scherzo instead of the slow movement forecast by the transition from the end of the first movement. However, the Adagio third movement occurs instead of the expected central trio, and the scherzo \\"forgets to come back\\", being replaced by the finale .

In the first part, Master Shake freezes himself in Dr. Weird's lab and awakes up nine years later disoriented and with no knowledge of the whereabouts of Frylock and Meatwad. In the second part, Shake discovers the world is now controlled by a god-like figure named Allen who kills anyone who misbehaves in order to maintain the world as a Utopia where everyone has respect for one another. \\"Allen\\" is the first episode of the series to be branded under an alternative title, and the first part marks the final appearance of Dr. Weird. The script for the beginning of the first part was read live by the main cast at Dragon*Con in 2010, months before the episode originally aired on television.DragonCon 2010 ‚Äì Aqua Teen Hunger Force Script Reading This is the first two-part episode since \\"Last Last One Forever and Ever\\" and \\"Rabbot Redux\\"; no other multi-part episodes have premiered since. Both parts later aired together back-to-back in a half-hour block on May 29, 2011. Both parts ranked #1 in their respective time slots on basic cable with all key adult demographics, and the May 29, 2011 airing was seen by 1.675 million viewers. Both parts have been made available on DVD, and other forms of home media, including on demand streaming. Plot Part 1 The newly formed \\"Aqua Unit Patrol Squad\\", a detective squad made up of Master Shake, Meatwad, and Frylock, anthropomorphic fast-food items, are under their latest investigation at an abandoned house to find out if a man is having a sexual affair with the woman they are working for. After Frylock leaves because of a debate over the new show not being any good, Shake and Meatwad fall asleep. Later, when they wake up, a construction worker, whom they believe to be the person having an affair with their client, begins to demolish the house. Shake believes this to be an insurance scam, and that he may be trying to hide \\"evidence\\" by tearing the house down. He puts on a beret, a fake mustache, and a poor French accent, and walks over to the construction worker. He tells him that his name is Jacques and that he just moved into the neighborhood, wondering what the man was doing. The construction worker replies that he is tearing the house down. Shake tries to cajole info out of the construction worker about the supposed insurance scam/sexual affair, but he does not budge. Meatwad then tells Shake that they are at the wrong house, and that the man tearing the house down got sent by the city, as it has been vacant for ten years. Shake even admits that the person they are looking for is small and white, while the man in front of them is large and black. After the construction worker orders them to leave, Shake rips off his disguise and accent and orders the construction worker to tell him what kind of back-room operation he had to have to look like that. Later, at the hospital, Shake is badly injured, to the point where he cannot move, and Meatwad must hand him water. Shake, with his voice very weak, brags about beating the man up. Meatwad then tells Shake that he checked with their client and that she was not even married, ruling out that she had a husband, or that she even had an affair, since she was single. Frylock reveals that the woman really wanted them to find her cat. Shake then comes up with the notion that the man that beat him up took the woman's cat, and framed them by saying that they are detectives. Shake wants her phone records, as well as everyone she has emailed. Frylock then complains that the \\"new show\\" still isn't any good, and that they should go back and do what they used to do. Shake then comes up with another plan: hypersleep. They go to Dr. Weird's castle at the South Jersey Shore to \\"borrow\\" hypersleep chambers and freeze themselves for nine years. The reason for this is because crime will surely have increased by then, so as a result they will have more business. After they all get into the chambers, Shake freezes himself, and Frylock leaves because he sees it as a terrible, hair-brained scheme. After nine years, Shake awakens, and sees that there was a monster named Danny in the chamber that was making love to his face on and off the entire time so he could deposit his eggs into him. Shake (now sporting a full beard) is disgusted by this, and then jumps at the sight of Danny being electrocuted by lightning. Shake gets a cab ride to an abortion clinic and discovers that \\"everything is free now\\" because everyone is supposed to be good. After he gets an abortion, protesters outside are also shot by lightning, as is the doctor that performed the abortion on Shake. Shake then goes back to his home, now in Seattle, and is horrified to discover that no one is there. Part 2 Shake goes over to his neighbor Carl's house (now repainted and with random junk in the yard) to discover that he had moved away, and instead, a man named George Lowe lives there, under the alias \\"Mister Beefy\\". George shows him an area to rent that is in a bad section of town. It, however, is free. Kids run away with items in the room and get blasted by the lightning. Shake does not feel like buying it, and then George says that everything is free, vulgarly. Then a blast of lightning kills George. Shake makes a run to a phone booth and leaves many unsuccessful messages on Frylock's answering machine to come and pick him up (Frylock and Meatwad now live in an apartment). Frylock, after having enough of his messages, destroys his answer machine. Shake wanders around for a moment, and is then stopped by some friendly gangsters who ask Shake if he needs directions. Shake is frightened by them and is surprised that they do not want to kill him. One of the gangsters then pulls out a knife and is then electrocuted by the lightning after mentioning Allen and threatening him. Shake questions the other gangster about this Allen, and he tries to walk away from Shake, pretending to not know what he is talking about. Shake is then abducted and thrown into a tiny room with thousands of small monitors inside. The room has a banner outside that reads, \\"BEHAVE FOR THE ALLEN\\". It is supposed to say alien, but \\"Allen\\" says they, \\"fucked it up.\\" Allen says that the monitors track all bad deeds around the entire world, and when spotted the perpetrators are electrocuted, so that the Earth can remain good. Allen then explains to Shake that he is the meanest person on the planet, and that he is going to electrocute him. But Shake responds that he has on a \\"forcefield\\"; Allen believes this, and refrains from killing him. Frylock and Meatwad then go right next to the room where Allen and Shake are located and Meatwad tells Frylock a plan he has. Allen tells Shake that he has an abusive father, who forced him to do the job he is doing, after Allen and his friend Tommy have a party and Tommy ruined his father's pool table. Shake then tells Allen that he knows his father, and that his father is going out of town on business. Allen sees this as the perfect opportunity to party with his friend Tommy, and tells Shake to do his job. Meatwad's plan starts, with him saying tiny swears such as \\"doody\\" and \\"butt\\", while Frylock goes all out and says things like \\"suck my fry dick\\". Allen blasts and kills Frylock and gives Shake his powers and goes up out of the room, leaving Shake in charge. But before he can go up to the party room, it catches fire because Tommy was smoking, and Allen argues with his father. Shake then flicks a button which puts a shield on the tower, and Allen's father electrocutes and kills him for \\"his own good\\". Production Both parts of \\"Allen\\" were written and directed by series creators Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro who have written and directed every episode of the series.

It originally aired on Showtime on December 18, 2011. The extended 85-minute episode sees the culmination of Abu Nazir's terrorist plot at the Vice President's summit, while Carrie Mathison's downward spiral continues. The season finale was highly acclaimed by critics and with 1.71 million viewers was the highest rated finale ever for a Showtime first-year series. Plot Day one Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) records a videotape of himself, explaining his future actions as an attack against a domestic threat -- namely Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) and his advisors, whom Brody blames for the deaths of 82 children during a drone strike in Pakistan. He leaves the camera's memory card at a drop-off point. Meanwhile, a depressed Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is visited by Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin). Carrie implores Saul to follow up on her investigation into Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban). She also wonders aloud why Brody betrayed her by turning her in, leading Saul to realize that Carrie is in love with Brody. That night, Tom Walker (Chris Chalk) commandeers an apartment overlooking the State Department, which is the site of the Vice President Walden's upcoming policy summit. After subduing the apartment's resident, Walker sets up a vantage point at the window for his sniper attack. Meanwhile, in his garage, Brody is discovered by Dana (Morgan Saylor) as he conducts a Muslim prayer ritual. Brody admits to Dana that he converted to Islam while he was in captivity and asks her to keep it a secret from the rest of the family. Day two Saul presents David Estes (David Harewood) with a heavily redacted CIA document, believing it to concern a drone strike against Nazir. Estes dismisses the document and tells Saul to focus on protecting Vice President Walden. Brody gets dressed for the summit, concealing his explosive vest under his Marine uniform. Dana, well aware of her father's bizarre behavior, becomes uneasy and asks him not to go. Upon hearing about the summit on the radio, Carrie recognizes it as a possible target for Walker and Nazir. She asks Virgil (David Marciano) to drive her there. At the summit, Carrie witnesses Brody's arrival. As lawmakers convene in front of the State Department, Walker opens fire. Walden's chief aide, Elizabeth Gaines (Linda Purl), is shot in the back and killed. As Walker continues to fire into the crowd, the surviving VIPs are rushed into a secure bunker beneath the Harry S Truman Building. In the chaos, Brody is dragged past the building's metal detectors (since his suicide vest contained metal ball bearings it would have been detected). He finds himself in the bunker with Walden, Estes, and other high-ranking officials. Outside, Carrie contacts Saul and tells him that Walker's sniper attack is merely a diversion from the terrorist's actual attack. During the conversation, Carrie realizes that Brody has been sequestered with Walden, and tries to tell Saul that the elimination of the Vice President and the other high-value targets is the true goal of the attack. However, Saul believes that Carrie's obsession with Brody is resurfacing. After dismissing her theory, Saul sends Secret Service agents to contain her. Carrie figures out what is happening and escapes in Virgil's van. Inside the bunker, Brody approaches Walden and attempts to detonate his explosive vest, only to find that the device has become disabled owing to disconnected wires. He retreats into a bathroom stall and works on repairing the vest. Meanwhile, Carrie arrives at Brody's house and encounters Dana, urging her to call her father and talk him out of the attack. However, Dana dials 911 and reports Carrie to the police. After Carrie is confronted by Jessica (Morena Baccarin), she is placed under arrest. After repairing the vest, Brody prepares to enter the bunker and carry out the attack. However, he receives a call from Dana, who tells him about Carrie's accusations and insists that Brody tell her that he will be returning home that night. After much agonizing, Brody makes the promise and forgoes detonating the vest. When an all clear is given, Brody and the other dignitaries start to file out of the bunker. Day three Saul meets with Vice President Walden. He demands to know the story behind the covered-up drone strike, and has brought along a big bargaining chip in the form of evidence that Walden authorized torture when he was head of the CIA. As Walden cannot allow that to be publicized, Saul is shown footage of Walden and Estes ordering the drone strike that killed 82 children, which was deemed to be acceptable collateral damage in their attempt to kill Abu Nazir. Carrie is released from police custody. Her sister Maggie (Amy Hargreaves) is there to pick her up, but Brody is also there to confront her. He reiterates to Carrie that he is not a terrorist, and berates her for terrifying his family and continuing to harass him. This conversation is Carrie's breaking point: With her life and career in a shambles, she now even doubts her own sanity, as nothing came out of her theory about Brody (she has no idea she actually stopped his attack). Clearly in distress, she stumbles into her sister's car and asks to be taken to the hospital. That night, Brody goes to retrieve the recording he dropped off, but it is gone. He goes home, gets his gun, and goes to meet Walker, who does not believe the vest did not work and pulls a gun on Brody. Walker has Abu Nazir on his cell phone, who wants to talk to Brody. Brody explains to Nazir that his vest malfunctioned, but that maybe it is a good thing that it did, as he is now a trusted ally of the man who is going to be the next President, and will be able to influence him. Nazir seems amenable but tells Brody that he must eliminate the \\"wild card.\\" Brody shoots Walker in the head. Two days later Saul barges into Carrie's hospital room, where she is being prepared for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in hopes of treating her bipolar disorder. Saul tries to put a stop to the procedure, but Carrie is undeterred, feeling that she has no choice with her life in ruin. She mentions that short-term memory loss is a side effect, but it is usually temporary. Saul tells her she was wrong about Brody but right about Abu Nazir; Walden ordered a drone strike that killed 82 children, including Abu Nazir's youngest son. Carrie is anesthetized before beginning the ECT. As she begins to fall asleep, she recalls the moment where Brody was shouting Issa's name in his sleep. She now realizes that Brody had a connection with Abu Nazir's dead son. However, the thoughts are fleeting as she falls asleep and the doctors begin the ECT, which induces a seizure in Carrie. Production The episode's story was conceived by executive producers Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon, while the teleplay was written by Gansa and co-executive producer Chip Johannessen. Executive producer Michael Cuesta directed the episode. The episode was structured to have a quiet first act, a frenetic second act, and then a quiet third act. This is reflected in the cinematography -- the first and third acts are filmed with still cameras, while the second act is filmed entirely with handhelds. Reception Ratings The original broadcast received 1.71 million viewers, which made it Homeland's highest rated episode of the season, up 58% from the season premiere. In addition, it was Showtime's highest rated season finale ever for a freshman series. Reviews The season finale was highly acclaimed by critics. Out of 24 reviews of the episode indexed by Metacritic, 23 were positive and one was 'mixed'. Michael Hogan of The Huffington Post called \\"Marine One\\" \\"a monumentally satisfying, forward- leaning episode, one that resolved many of our most burning questions while leaving plenty of room for future drama\\". TIMEs James Poniewozik said it was a \\"tautly constricted and brilliantly acted episode\\". Andy Greenwald of Grantland.com hailed it as \\"a thrilling and devastating conclusion to what has been a supremely artful season of television\\". Both Damian Lewis and Claire Danes received extremely high marks for their performances in the finale. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall said this should surely be Damian Lewis' Emmy submission episode and that his acting was \\"raw, magnetic, unflinching, mesmerizing\\". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post thought the two leads delivered \\"breathtaking performances\\" and said \\"I don't think I've ever seen anyone portray vulnerability and pain as well as Claire Danes; she projected Carrie's deep depression like a force field of weighty despair\\". Strikes against the episode were generally considered to be a lack of resolution, and some major contrivances in the climactic bunker scene. Matt Roush of TV Guide praised the episode but said the resolution to the bunker scene was \\"awfully convenient, not as satisfying a twist as we're used to from this taut thriller\\", but that \\"it does reflect Homeland's unusually emotional context\\".  Accolades  Damian Lewis won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in this submitted episode at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards.

The surface is golden yellow. When you take a bite, it is fragrant, sweet, crumbly, mellow and delicious. The skin is thin, while the pastry is thick. There are several layers in one Changzhou Big Magao. Developments *In the beginning, the size of Changzhou Magao was as big as today. Although the prize of it was inexpensive, the taste, the color and the smell was really good. When it came to the market, every customer liked this kind of dessert. *On the other hand, some people who worked labor-intensive were complaining about the small size of Changzhou Magao. One cannot feed the stomach enough, but carrying so many ones was hard for taking alone. They suggested making a bigger one by using the raw materials of the three original ones. *To satisfy these special customers‚Äô request, the pastry cook changed the size of Changzhou Magao to be much bigger. The innovative ones were even much more popular than the initial ones. So Changzhou Magao is called Changzhou Big Magao. *Recoding by the Changzhou Government Record, in the late of Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, there were more than forty teahouses which sold Changzhou Big Magao in the Changzhou District.

Life Born in 1796 in Locarno, Switzerland, William Bally travelled as an artist with Johann Caspar Spurzheim from 1829. In 1832 it was advertised that he had created a set of 60 small plaster phrenological busts in a collaboration with him. He came to England and employed George Holyoake in Birmingham during the 1830s. At this time he was an associate of George Combe. The relationship with Holyoake ended badly, on Holyoake's account, Bally moving to Manchester and not making a promised cast of his head.Joseph McCabe, Life and Letters of George Jacob Holyoake (1908), pp. 28‚Äì30; archive.org. By 1836, Bally was curator of the Manchester Phrenological Society, which had been founded around 1829 and met for some time in rooms below his gallery. It included members who were surgeons, which may have helped him in gaining access to interesting subjects and post mortems. The organisation accumulated a large number of phrenological busts, with 210 being acquired in its first year. By the 1840s, phrenological exhibitions were being held at the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, attracting over 100,000 visitors and comprising thousands of casts, busts and masks. In 1841, Bally, who at least sometimes used a pantograph to create his work, made casts of inscriptions on Manx crosses, and later sold them to the antiquarian Henry Dryden.Philip Moore Kermode, Manx Crosses or The Inscribed and Sculptured Monuments of the Isle of Man from about the End of the Fifth to the beginning of the Thirteenth Century. Volume 1. (2005 reprint of 1907 work), p. 8; Google Books. He took part in a demonstration of hypnosis by James Braid in 1844.Donald Robertson (editor), The Discovery of Hypnosis: The Complete Writings of James Braid, the Father of Hypnotherapy (2009), p. 273; Google Books. In July 1849, after returning from a trip to the continent, Bally was advertising his services as a phrenologist with rooms at 54 King Street, Manchester, where he was charging five shillings for a consultation and rather less for attending to more than two people from the same family. Bally suffered from ill-health in his later years. In December 1850, it was announced that he had suffered a third \\"paralytic stroke\\" and was once again debilitated. A subscription fund was organised to support him and, together with a benefit concert, raised around ¬£400. An 1851 article in The Times suggested that the coloured waxes that he used for modelling contained toxic materials and that these were the cause of ulceration in his throat and paralysis in his hands and arms; he was periodically \\"completely paralysed\\". The substances varied according to colour but included white lead, copper, chrome yellow and vermillion. They probably entered his body through absorption and ingestion. Despite his poor health, Bally exhibited a bust at the Great Exhibition of 1851. He had recovered sufficiently to work by late 1852 and in early 1853 moved premises to Victoria Street. He reduced his prices and moved the studio to his house at Peel Terrace, on Tamworth Street, Hulme, in December 1855. His wife, Anna Maria Matilda Bally, died there in February 1856 and later that year Bally was once again operating his studio from Victoria Street. Continued poor health meant that the funds raised by his supporters in 1850 had largely sustained Bally thereafter, being paid to him in instalments of no more that 30 shillings per week. He was confined to bed for the last two years of his life and in July 1858 a further appeal for funds to assist him was made because the original amount was close to exhaustion. This drew support from donors such as Oliver Heywood and John Potter. Bally died in Manchester on 8 November 1858 and was buried with his wife a week later in a tomb at St Wilfrid's Roman Catholic Chapel in Hulme, where he had worshipped. In accordance with his instructions, a death mask that he had made of his wife was placed in his coffin. Bally had amassed a collection of about 1000 phrenological busts but most of it had been bought from him during his lifetime with the intention that it would be put on display in a museum that, at the time of his death, had not been built. They were stored for some time at the Manchester Mechanics' Institute on Cooper Street and later trusted to the interim care of Manchester Corporation. The remaining busts were bequeathed to Beneditti Lamarto, who was another Swiss practitioner. The fate of the collection is unknown: it was deposited in a museum at Harpurhey in 1860 and thereafter there is no record, although some examples of his work have been discovered and may or may not have formed part of that collection. Works Around 1833, Bally's book titled Mons. Bally‚Äôs Lectures on Casting, Modelling, &c.; was published in Nottingham by J. Hicklin and Co. Bally's purely sculptural works included a wax portrait of John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon,V&A; page. and busts of the calico printer Salis Schwabe and Samuel Fletcher. At the Liverpool Academy of Arts he exhibited busts of Samuel Hope (1832) and Thomas Henry Illidge (1837).Rupert Gunnis, Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851 (1965), p. 36.Edward Morris, Emma Roberts, The Liverpool Academy and Other Exhibitions of Contemporary Art in Liverpool, 1774-1867: a history and index of artists and works exhibited (1998), p. 57; Google Books. His phrenological busts included a death mask of William Palmer, a murderer who was executed. In 1844, he also made a cast of the interior of John Dalton's cranium and of a cyst therein, having arrived at the Manchester Royal Infirmary too late to make a caste of the head and face. Thomas Turner, a surgeon who lectured at the Manchester Royal Institution, used Bally's phrenological casts in demonstrations there in the 1840s.

This European research project, funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, aims at creating new products and knowledge in antiseptic coatings suitable to be applied on a large variety of surfaces.  Introduction  NASLA results are hoped to have a clear and immediate exploitation potential to improve or develop new products currently commercialized by the four SMEs: biomedical implants for DIPROMED, agro/food industry equipment for ALCE Calidad] and EASRETH, and personnel protective systems for Aero Sekur. As soon as the antiseptic functionality can be provided to SMEs products, the following new products are to be directly put on the market: DIPROMED: biomedical implants ALCE and EASRETH: new antiseptic coating on surfaces to be used in food handling and processing Aero Sekur: new antiseptic textiles for personal protection systems (PPS) ALCE Calidad (Spain), EASRETH (Greece), DIPROMED and Aero Sekur (Italy) have limited access to research: the three research and development (R&D;) partners (Politecnico di Torino, Italy, KTH and Bactiguard, Sweden) guarantee the outsourcing of research and development activity in top- quality research institutions. This project is not focussed on solving short- term technological problems, but it is aimed to assist the four SMEs in acquiring technological know-how on a new antiseptic coating technology. NASLA is a European research project for the benefit of SMEs and has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme managed by Research Executive Agency (FP7/2007-2013, FP7/2007-2011) under grant agreement No. [262209].  NASLA research activity  A new and reliable antiseptic coating will be designed, prepared and tested leading to the delivery of a new generation of goods with enhanced functionalities, currently not available on the market. In particular a new silver nanoclusters‚Äìsilica composites coating having anti-septical properties superior to those existing on the market is being developed. The coating is made of silver nanoclusters embedded in a silica matrix. The technique used to deposit the coating (RF sputtering) is suitable to almost every kind of substrate (polymers, metals, glasses, etc.). The results achieved during the project are hoped to have a clear and immediate exploitation potential not only to improve or develop new products currently commercialized by the four SMEs, but also other applications such as : hospitals, schools, canteens, restaurants (and other areas where food is handled, processed or served), kitchen equipment production (cutlery and instrumentation for both private and professional use), beverages, the fishing industry, meat industries, and milk and dairy industries.

Born to a military captain, Tiahahu was active in military matters from a young age. She joined the war led by Pattimura against the Dutch colonial government when she was 17, fighting in several battles. After being captured in October 1817, she was released on account of her age. She continued to fight, and was captured again. Sent to Java to be a slave labourer, she fell ill on the way and, refusing to eat or take medicine, died on a ship in the Banda Sea. Tiahahu is considered a National Heroine of Indonesia. She has also been honoured with two statues, one in Ambon and one in Abubu; other namesakes include a warship, street, Moluccan social organization, and women's magazine. Biography Tiahahu was born in Santiago de Ab√∫bu village on Nusalaut Island, near Maluku, on 4 January 1800. Her father was Captain Paulus Tiahahu of the Soa Uluputi clan. After her mother died while she was an infant, Tiahahu was raised by her father. As a child, she was stubborn and followed her father wherever he went, at times joining him in planning attacks. Beginning in 1817 Tiahahu joined her father in a guerrilla war against the Dutch colonial government. They also backed Pattimura's army. She saw several battles. In a battle at Saparua Island, the troops killed Dutch commander Richement and wounded his replacement Commander Meyer. In another battle, she and her troops succeeded in burning Duurstede Fortress to the ground. During battles, she was said to throw stones at the Dutch troops if her soldiers were out of ammunition, while other accounts have her wielding a spear. After Vermeulen Kringer took over the Dutch military in Maluku, Tiahahu, her father, and Pattimura were captured in October 1817. Carried on the HNLMS Evertsen to Nusalaut, Tiahahu was the only captured soldier not punished; this was due to her young age. After a period of time in holding in Fort Beverwijk, where her father was executed, in late 1817 Tiahahu was released. She continued to fight against the Dutch. In a sweep in December 1817 Tiahahu and several other former rebels were caught. The captured guerrillas were placed on the Evertsen to be transported to Java; they were meant to be used as slave labour on the coffee plantations there. However, on the way Tiahahu fell ill. Refusing medication and food, she died on 2 January 1818 while the ship was crossing the Banda Sea; she received a burial at sea later that day. Legacy The statue to Tiahahu in Ambon Soon after Indonesia's independence, Tiahahu was declared a National Heroine of Indonesia; 2 January was designated Martha Christina Tiahahu Day. On that day, people in Maluku spread flower petals over the Banda Sea in an official ceremony honouring her struggle. However, the ceremony is smaller than that honouring Pattimura, on 15 May. Several monuments have been dedicated to Tiahahu. In Ambon, capital of the province of Maluku, an tall statue of her holding a spear was erected in 1977; it stands in Karangpanjang overlooking the Banda Sea. In Abubu, a statue of her leading soldiers while holding a spear was erected and dedicated on the 190th anniversary of her death. She also has several items named after her, including a street in Karangpanjang, Ambon, and a warship, the KRI Martha Christina Tiahahu. Other organizations have also taken Tiahahu's name as a symbol of bravery and \\"spirit of struggle\\", including a social organization for Moluccans in Jakarta and a women's magazine in Ambon. Death Tiahahu died on 2 January 1818 at Banda Sea, two days before her 18th birthday and several years after suffering a stroke.

He tried in vain to keep Nassau-Hadamar out of the war. His lands suffered from the passage of all kinds of Imperial and Protestant troops, which plundered and requisitioned them into poverty. Highly indebted, John Louis was forced to sell Esterau to Peter Melander Graf von Holzappel in 1643. John Louis was raised a Calvinist, as was sent in 1629 by his brothers as a diplomat to Vienna to negotiate a truce with Emperor Ferdinand II. Here John Louis converted to Catholicism under influence of Wilhelm Lamormaini. John Louis was much appreciated by the Emperor for his diplomatic skills. In 1638 he successfully led the peace negotiations in Cologne and Munster. In 1645 he was added to the Imperial delegation under Maximilian von und zu Trauttmansdorff who negotiated the Peace of Westphalia. By 1647 he had replaced Trauttmansdorff as head of the Imperial delegation, and it was he who finalized the treaty. For this, he was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece by King Philip IV of Spain.

He reinforced the army of the archipelago and promoted trade with America. In his participation during the Eighty Years' War, he was made Governor of J√ºlich after the Spanish victory at the Siege of J√ºlich in August 1621. Sail to the Philippines On December 2, 1661, King Philip IV appointed him as the new Governor-General of the Philippines. He sailed to New Spain before sailing for the Philippines. The galleon San Jos√©, however, was delayed in its voyage from Manila until 1662, and docked in Acapulco in 1663. Salcedo was forced to sail on March 25, 1663. Aboard the ship with Salcedo were 11 Augustinian friars bound for the Philippines. One of them was Jos√© de Paternina Samaniego, appointed commissioner of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. Governor-General of the Philippines Due to the rainy season, Salcedo did not land in Leyte, which was the usual landing place. Instead, he was brought up North, to Cape Enga√±o. He reached Manila in September 1663. In a letter written by Salcedo to his friend Francisco Yzquierdo in 1664, Salcedo mentioned the situation of the Philippines. In the letter, Salcedo stated that the treasury only had 35,000 pesos. The Spanish in the archipelago were tired of the many rebellions in North Luzon, and the soldiers have not received any pay. Trade in the Philippines was dull so Salcedo tried reviving Philippine trade by sending envoys to Indonesia and Thailand for negotiations on trade status. In 1665, Salcedo heard of the existence of gold mines in the Cordilleras, an area dominated by people called . So, Salcedo formed an expedition of around 100 men led by Admiral Pedro Duran de Monforte to go Christianize the people in the area and excavate the gold at the same time.Kane, S.E., 1933, Thirty Years with the Philippine Head-Hunters, New York: Grosset & Dunlap The mission, however, failed due to difficult terrain met by the expedition. In order to contain the serious Zambal uprisings, Salcedo ordered a fort be built in Paynauen. Fort Paynauen was once the most formidable Spanish garrison in Central Luzon during the first century of the Spanish regime in the Philippines. Also known as Playa Honda, the fort was constructed on the advice of Admiral de Monforte. Mexican convicts were usually shipped to the Philippines to serve involuntary military service for the Spanish army in the archipelago. Salcedo raised 100,000 pesos in order to acquire real soldiers for the Spanish in the Philippines. Salcedo also obtained 120,000 pesos, which is the subsidy of New Spain for the Philippines. Officials got 30,000 pesos from the subsidy upon consent of Salcedo. Last years In Salcedo's last year as Governor-General of the Philippines (1668), a coup was organized by Paternina to topple Salcedo from power. The master of arms of Intramuros, Agustin de Zepeda, was allied with Paternina, as well as General Sebastian Rayo, Nicolas de Pamplona (one of the alcalde ordinarios of Manila), and other men. Salcedo was caught immediately and Juan Manuel de la Pe√±a Bonifaz succeeded him. Pe√±a went on giving all the wealth acquired by Salcedo to Paternina and his allies, including 10,000 pesos for himself. Salcedo was imprisoned for a year before being shipped to New Spain to face the Holy Office of the Inquisition. He died during the voyage due to his failing health.

The festival, established at least as far back as 1847, is celebrated on the first Tuesday in the month of July every year. The festival The Dutch reported existence of the festival at least as far back as 1847 and was mentioned in a report by Governor Cornelis Nagtglas in 1860. The festival is used to mark the beginning of the fishing season in Elmina. The name Bakatue is from the Fante dialect and translates as \\"draining of a lagoon\\". The celebration of the festival was instituted to commemorate the founding of Elmina by the Portuguese in the early days of the colonization of the then Gold Coast. It also is used to offer thanks and prayers to the gods for a good fishing year. Programme of activities The Elmina states set aside the first Monday and Tuesday of the month of July for the festival. Monday All necessary customary activities are performed on this day. Tuesday Women in Kente riding on the Brenya lagoon It coincides with the annual rainy season of Ghana. Tuesday was chosen because it is regarded locally as the day for the sea god. As such in Elmina, as in many fishing communities in Ghana, fishermen do not go to sea on Tuesdays in order to honour the sea god. During the festival, the Paramount Chief and his sub- chiefs and the entire state of Elmina offer the sacred festival food of eggs and mashed yam mixed with palm oil to Nana Brenya, the river god, and pray for peace. On the morning of the festival, all members of the Elmina royal family participate in a royal possession made up of chiefs and stool carriers. Chiefs of higher towns in the Elmina paramount area ride decorated palanquins. After the procession and the giving of various addresses by select chiefs and invited guest, the chief priest casts his net three times into the Brenya Lagoon. This is followed by declarations of the end to the ban on fishing, drumming, funerals and other social activities in the Elmina traditional area, after which there is the riding on the lagoon by women wearing Kente cloth and local festive headgear. A royal procession leading to the chief's palace amidst traditional music ends the festival. All the fish that is caught by the net, during the ceremony, is offered to the gods as a symbol to thank them for the harvest. The day ends with merry-making after the durbar.

He had two brothers (≈†imon and Ladislav/L√°szl√≥) and one sister (Jana). The family had lived for centuries in Ko≈°√∫ty (Kossut), dating back to the 13th century when king B√©la IV of Hungary granted them nobility and the feod in Turiec (Tur√≥c) in 1263. The surname means in Slovak \\"a billy goat\\" and a billy goat was also in their coat of arms. The family was a typical example of provincial gentry in the Kingdom of Hungary and was kindred with other families of the local gentry in the region of Turiec and Liptov (Lipt√≥). The mother tongue of the Turiec branch of the family (including him and his brother L√°szl√≥) was Slovak and also the family archive contains only records in Slovak language together with official Latin documents. His brother L√°szl√≥ moved from Ko≈°√∫ty to Monok and would become the father of Hungarian statesman Lajos Kossuth.() Juraj Ko≈°√∫t studied law then he returned to the family estate. On 2 November 1803, he married Anna Zolnensis; the couple had no children. Work ≈†t√∫r's language standard was dedicated to \\"ƒéurko Ko≈°√∫t\\". His language skills, legal education and probably also the noble origin opened him many opportunities. He was an assessor in the County Court of Turiec (Tur√≥c), a lay judge in Liptov (Lipt√≥), Trenƒç√≠n (Trencs√©n) and Orava (√Årva) counties and a superintendent of Lutheran Church in Z√°turƒçie.

Surprised ≈†t√∫r figured out that they were led by \\"Ko≈°√∫t, the uncle of that angry man from Pest [Lajos Kossuth]\\". Ko≈°√∫t organized petitions in several waves. The first two (at the end of 1842) were signed by 152 signatories who confirmed their interest in Slovak newspaper (mostly lower nobles and officials). He also noted that he collected signatures only from one part of the county and he could collect much more if necessary. The petitions had a significant impact and according to ≈†t√∫r's coworker Jozef Miloslav Hurban, they directly influenced ≈†t√∫r's decision to publish his newspaper in Slovak instead of Slovakized Czech (used as a literal language by Slovak Protestants) and to define a new Slovak language standard instead of Koll√°r's biblical Czech and Bernol√°k's standard based on West-Slovak dialect. The new standard was based on Central-Slovak dialects spoken also in Turiec. He began corresponding with ≈†t√∫r and promised him to make every effort \\"for the good of his (own) Slovak nation\\".

The details about this petition are not known, but it should be signed both by Catholic and Protestant Church authorities and the secular authorities including the vice-isp√°n of Turiec.

Davis, 531 U.S. 230 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned the validity of a Bureau of Prisons regulation which lowered prisoners' sentences for completion of a substance abuse program. The statute however restricted this credit to those who did not engage in a felony aided by a firearm. The Court upheld the regulation over the dissent of three Justices. Background In 1995, the Bureau of Prisons published a rule to implement \\"early release incentives\\". Only prisoners who did not commit a \\"crime of violence\\" would be eligible for the program. The Bureau defined this to include a drug trafficking conviction which received a sentence increase due to the use of a weapon during the commission of that crime. After split decisions by circuit Courts of Appeal over the vagueness of the regulation, the Bureau published a revised one in 1997. This gave broader discretion to the Director of the Bureau to grant these term reductions. Christopher A. Lopez applied for the program but was rejected. Lopez had been convicted of possession with intent to distribute while possessing a firearm at the time of his offense. The Bureau of Prisons defined this a \\"crime of violence\\". The United States District Court for the District of South Dakota reversed a decision by the Bureau of Prisons that Lopez would not be subject to term reductions. Finding that underlying convictions that were \\"nonviolent\\" should be reconsidered for the program by the Bureau of Prisons, the District Court reasoned Lopez was a candidate for term reductions. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, and Lopez appealed. Opinion of the Court Majority opinion Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court, affirming the Eighth Circuit and finding Lopez ineligible for the program. Justice Ginsburg framed the question as whether the Bureau has \\"discretion to delineate...those whose current offense is a felony involving a firearm\\". Ginsburg argued that the statutory language provided the Director of the Bureau of Prisons the authority to make these sentence distinctions as the text used the word \\"may\\" consider rather than \\"shall\\". Further, the argument advanced by Lopez would restrict the new 1997 regulation, which was intended to provide broader authority to the Director. Having held the Bureau's interpretation of the statute as proper, the Court concluded by finding that Lopez was not eligible for the program. Stevens' dissent Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Stevens argued that the phrasing of \\"may be reduced\\" was a command by Congress for the Director of Prisons to consider cases where the underlying conviction was not violent. He concluded that the Bureau was free to make these distinctions, so long as it held to Congress's intent which he saw as aiding Lopez's arguments.

From this it is deduced that the first settlers of Soria were Dorians. However, nothing about this has been corroborated by archaeology. Other researchers defend that Soria derives from dauria or daurius, names that refer to the river Duero  Early history  Just before the Roman conquest, the area of Soria was inhabited by the Arevaci and other Celtiberians. In what is now called Cerro del Castillo, was discovered an ancient settlement related to Numantia, the Arevaci city that resisted Roman conquest for a century and then committed collective suicide in order to escape slavery. Some experts consider that the Suebi were among first settlers of Soria proper. The Suebi kings, according to Tutor and Malo in their Compedio historial de las dos Numancias, established in it one of their courts. Madonna del Mir√≥n Hermitage, started to be built in the 6th century AD by the Suebi. Arab conquest Later, after the Arab conquest of Spain, it grew in importance due to its proximity to the border of the Christian lands, which in the 8th century had settled along the Duero river. In 869 Soria was the centre of the rebellion of Suleyman ibn-Abus against the emir of C√≥rdoba, who sent his son Hakan to quench it.  Christian conquest  During the 11th century it became an important and strategic enclave due to its situation near Duero and it delimited the Christian and Muslim lands with the so-called \\"marca del Duero\\" or \\"l√≠nea del Duero\\". In the early 12th century the city was conquered by Alfonso I the Battler, being absorbed into the Kingdom of Le√≥n in 1134. It was repopulated and became the head or main population of those frontier. This reflected in the slogan \\"Cabeza de Extremadura\\" present in the coat of arms of the city. During the 12th century, Soria was an important location due to the battles between the kingdoms of Le√≥n, Castile, Aragon and Navarre. When Alfonso VII died, the child king Alfonso VIII was protected by the Lara family in Soria. Alfonso VIII of Castile gave the city several privileges which it maintained until modern times as a reward for its support. It is generally believed that Alfonso VIII gave the city its Fuero Extenso, of great importance in the history of medieval law, and that was used as a basis for the Fuero Real (Other researchers, however, defend that the Fuero Real predates the Fuero Extenso). The Fuero Extenso already describes the medieval structure of the city between the local Nobility (Doce Linajes), the commoners (Jurados de Cuadrilla) and the surrounding villages (Sexmeros de la Tierra). In 1195 the town was stormed by Sancho VII of Navarre, but later recovered and continued to develop its splendor and trades, mostly held by a community of Jews. A big source of revenue, Soria being head of some of the royal ca√±adas, was the wool industry. A proof of the importance of Soria in this period is its presence among the 16 cities with right of representation in the Castilian Parliament (the Cortes). At the end of the 14th century, Henry II of Castile gave Soria to Bertrand Du Guesclin, as a reward for his support during the Castilian Civil War. The local population rebelled against the royal decision, and Du Guescin army stormed the city.  Decline  church of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Mayor, build in the 16th Century. Soria lost most of its importance after the unification of Aragon and Castile in 1479, and above all after the decree of exile issued against the Jews in 1492. By 1530 the city would roughly have between 4,000 and 5,500 inhabitants. In the War of Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714), Soria sided with Philip V. In 1808, it was captured and set on fire by the French troops. The Soria viaduct (1890) Modern The economic and social crisis in Spain in the early 20th century, and the Spanish Civil War during Francisco Franco's dictatorship which followed, had negative effects on Soria and the surrounding area, which became depopulated due to increased emigration. The policy of the current authorities aims to strengthen the local economy pivoting on Soria's tourism potential, and has also launched a program of reconstruction for the neighboring villages.

Background Alfonso Enriquez de Castilla was the son of Fadrique Alfonso, 25th Master of the Order of Santiago, and an unnamed lady. His father was murdered on 29 May 1358 in the Alc√°zar of Seville, on the orders of his brother Peter. He was the founder of the lineage of Enriquez, and is the first Admiral of Castile of his family since 1405, and first lord of Medina de Rio Seco. His paternal grandparents were King Alfonso XI of Castile and Eleanor de Guzm√°n. He was a nephew of King Henry II of Castile and cousin of King John I of Castile. His brother was Pedro Enriquez de Castilla, Count of Trast√°mara, Lemos and Sarria, Constable of Castile and Pertiguero mayor de Santiago. His sister was Eleanor of Castile, who married the Marshal of Castile Diego Gomez Sarmiento. Biography Alfonso Enriquez remained hidden while living his uncle Pedro I of Castile, who ordered to kill his father in 1358 in the Alcazar of Seville. Although contemporary Castilian chroniclers wrapped the figure of his mother in mystery and later genealogists do not mention her, other authors, for example, the Portuguese Fern√£o Lopes wrote in connection with events that occurred in 1384, that the Admiral was the son of a Jewess. The \\"Memorial of old things\\" attributed to the dean of Toledo, Diego de Castilla, said Fadrique had Alfonso from a Jewess from Guadalcanal called Paloma. He tells a story where King Ferdinand the Catholic was hunting and was a hawk with a heron and both walked away, leaving the king to follow, and Martin de Rojas was always with the hawk until he saw it leave and throw after a dove. Asking the king for his hawk, Martin replied, \\"Lord, there goes after our grandmother\\", being Martin a descendant of Paloma himself. In 1389, John I of Castile gave him the area around Aguilar de Campos. In later years, he managed to extend his territory. Until 1402, he served the King as a commander and administered the castle of Medina de Rioseco. In 1387, Alfonso married Juana de Mendoza. In 1395, together with his wife, he restarted the construction of the Monastery of Santa Clara de Palencia, who had been begun by Henry II of Castile and his wife Queen Juana Manuel, by planning the church and cemetery of the Admirals of Castile. It is conjectured that it must have been at the behest of his wife that the title of Admiral of Castile passed to him upon the death of her brother Diego Hurtado de Mendoza in 1405, who held that post. In addition to military action at sea, this post also involved trying to obtain civil and criminal jurisdiction over all ports of the kingdom of Granada, culminating after three years with the taking of Antequera. The Enr√≠quez family held the title of Admiral of Castile from 1405 to 1705. Alfonso was the most famous admiral in the family, winning many sea battles. Guadelupe where Alfonso Enr√≠quez died in 1429 In 1407, he defeated the combined fleet of Tunis (Hafsid), Granada (Nasrid) and Tlemcen (Capital city of the Zianid Kingdom of Tlemcen). This was his last major sea battle. Afterward, he inspected the fleet and led military actions on land, such as the capture of Antequera in 1410. He was involved in the court's political undertakings and in its feasts. In 1421, John II of Castile granted him the lordship of Medina de Rio Seco \\"for the many good and loyal and outstanding and distinguished services done to King Don Juan my grandfather and to King Henry my father and my lord, and still does to me,\\" instead he chose to settle and establish primogeniture in favor of his children. The city is since known as the City of the admirals. At the end of his life, he retired to the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe, where he died in 1429 at the age of 75. He was buried with his wife and several children in the monastery of Santa Clara de Palencia, which they had been founders. In his will, he left the monastery for the construction of four chapels. His widow donated another . The poet and biographer Fern√°n P√©rez de Guzm√°n, a contemporary of Alfonso's, described him as medium-sized, chubby, red-haired, discrete and not a talker. The historian Esteban de Garibay (1533‚Äì1600) described him as hot-tempered and quickly irritated. Nuptials and offspring In 1387, Alfonso Enriquez, posing as a servant, asked Juana de Mendoza (widowed by the Battle of Aljubarrota, August 1385), if she would marry his Lord (himself). The disguised Alfonso received the answer that Alfonso Enr√≠quez was the son of a \\"marrana\\" (family of converted Jews), at which the supposed servant slapped her. Revealing his trickery, it is said that was requested the presence of a priest to marry them \\"for let it not be said that any man had raised his hand to her who was not her husband.\\" It is also said that on one occasion, having arrived late at night, he had to sleep with his company in the field, receiving the explanation the following day from the haughty Mendoza that \\"No self respecting Castilian woman would open the doors of her castle to anyone at night.\\" The result of his marriage to Juana de Mendoza were thirteen children: *Fadrique Enriquez (first-born, c. 1388), married to Mariana Fernandez de Cordoba and Ayala, and father of Queen Juana of Aragon; *Enrique Enr√≠quez de Mendoza (died c. 1489), started the lineages of Enr√≠quez de Toledo and Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, Count of Alba de Liste title since August 8, 1451 by John II of Castile; *Pedro Enriquez, who died as a child (not be confused with Pedro Enriquez de Quinones, son of his brother Frederic Enriquez); *Beatriz Enr√≠quez (? -1439), married to Pedro de Portocarrero and Cabeza de Vaca, lord of Moguer, son of Martin Fernandez Portocarrero, IV lord of Moguer, and Eleanor Cabeza de Vaca; she was buried in the Convent of Poor Clares of Mudejar style Moguer; *Leonor Enr√≠quez, married in 1410 to Rodrigo Pimentel Alonso T√©llez de Meneses, II Count of Benavente; *Aldonza Enr√≠quez, married in 1410 to Rodrigo Alvarez Osorio; *Isabel Enriquez (? -1469), married to Juan Ramirez de Arellano, lord of the Cameros; *In√©s Enr√≠quez, married to Juan Hurtado de Mendoza, lord of Almazan; *Blanca Enriquez, married to Pedro Nunez de Herrera, lord of Herrera and second Lord of Pedraza; a daughter of this marriage, Elvira de Herrera y Enr√≠quez, married Pedro Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, V Lord of Aguilar, being parents, among others, of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, the Great Captain; *Constanza Enriquez, married to Juan de Tovar, Lord of Berlanga; *Maria Enriquez (? -1441), married to Juan de Rojas and Manrique, lord of Monz√≥n Campos, mayor of Castile and doncel of the king, who took part in the Battle of La Higueruela in The Vega of Granada, next to John II of Castile and the Constable Alvaro de Luna; *Mencia Enriquez (? -1480), married in 1430 to Juan Fernandez Manrique de Lara, Count de Casta√±eda since 1436; *Rodrigo Enriquez, whom his mother in his will of 1431 leaves some property, calling him \\"my son, the Archdeacon Rodrigo Enriquez.\\"; he was buried in the Cathedral of Palencia. Out of wedlock he had an illegitimate son: *Juan Enr√≠quez, Bishop of Lugo, who his father, before going to Seville, had left as captain general of the fleet as it was a \\"tried and true knight.\\" Legend of the Christ of the Clear In the chapel of the Holy Christ of the Church of Santa Clara de Palencia a reclining Christ is venerated introduced in a glass case. It is said that on one of Alfonso's ships, sailing in the war against the Moors in the years 1407 to 1410, a lookout spotted something strangely glowing. Approaching to address they found that it was a glass case that housed the image of Christ laying down. Alfonso surprised by the finding in such a place, decided to move it to Palenzuela. Being transported on the back of an animal, escorted by soldiers and knights to reach this Reinoso de Cerrato, the animal stubbornly decided to stop in front of the castle where Poor Clares nuns had resided. When they let the animal loose, it headed towards the monastery of Poor Clares. Seen as a divine decision, they left the picture there for veneration, now known as the Cristo de las Claras.

Fair Scene at Night (1920) Thomas Bonfrey Burton The market town of Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, has had a fair since medieval times. In the early days the fairs were places for trading goods and animals, and were useful for meeting people and finding news of what was happening elsewhere in the country. Towns were given the right to hold fairs by Royal charter. In the early 12th century Archbishop Thurstan was granted a charter to hold fairs four times a year, each lasting up to five days. Beverley's medieval fairs were: *Feast of St John of Beverley (7 May) *Ascension Day (Early summer) *Feast of St John the Baptist (21‚Äì5 June) *Translation of St John of Beverley (25 October) The four annual fairs survived until the 20th century, although the dates changed over the years. All these fairs were for the sale of cattle and horses and were held on North Bar Within or Without. One of the two market places, Saturday Market or Wednesday Market, was used at the same time for selling general goods. Another trading area was at Highgate where goods not generally sold on the weekly markets were available, attracting ‚Äòforeigners‚Äô or people from other areas such as York. The great horse fair was on Ascension Day-eve (the Cross Fair). A toll was charged for a horse entering the town and another if it was sold.  Modern times  By the 20th century, the sale of livestock at fairs had dwindled. In 1928, sheep and cattle were only sold on the Ringing Day fair. The pleasure part of the fair, however, had gained great popularity. These funfairs were held on Saturday Market. As the fairground equipment became larger and heavier and the use of the motor vehicle became more widespread, Saturday Market place was no longer suitable for the purpose. On 8 September 1958, Minute 581 of the Beverley Town Council states: ‚ÄúIt was noted that the agreement between BTC and John Farrar and Joseph Shaw to hold four fairs a year on the Market Place expired after Midsummer Fair 1959‚Äù. On 27 October (Minute 694), ‚ÄúIt was resolved that the fair should be removed from the Market Place.‚Äù On 7 September 1959, the Town Clerk reported that Mr John Farrar and Joseph Shaw had accepted terms offered for use of space for the four fairs commencing with the October fair. The fair was held four times a year on Morton Lane car park, which also housed the Town‚Äôs coach park. In 2002, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, against the wishes of a large number of the residents sold the Morton Lane car park to Tesco, leaving the Town with nowhere to hold the fair. The council offered space on the Westwood to hold the fair but the organisers together with the solicitors of The Showmen‚Äôs Guild demanded that they were allocated a site ‚Äòwithin the walls of Beverley‚Äô stating that The Royal Charter gave them that right. In 2003, the Beverley Town Fair was, once again sited in the centre of the town on Saturday Market. The fair is now limited to one week a year starting on August Bank Holiday Sunday.

The results have been staggering: hundreds of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty; China's economy continues to grow at a rate of 8‚Äì12 per cent annually, as it has for two decades and by the end of 2005, China was the fourth largest economy and third largest exporting nation in the world, after the United States and Germany.Lei, P., Long, B. and Pamlin, C. (2005) 'Chinese Companies in the 21st century helping or destroying the planet?' April, World Wildlife Fund survey Nevertheless, China's environment paid a steep price for this economic growth. Water pollution, air pollution, and soil degradation pose enormous threat to ecosystems and human health. However, these issues are being taken seriously by the Chinese government and are now being incorporated into policies and plans at the highest level.Jing, C., Richard, G. and Mun, S.H.

(2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge From environmental regulation to environmental governance China‚Äôs initial environmental governance The initial environmental regime in China saw the state playing a dominant role, while industry and community had little influence in affecting the regime. Primarily, the state consisted of administrative agencies, which included environmental departments and economic agencies with little or no participation from the legislative and judicial institutions.Shi, H. and Zhang, Lei (2006) 'China's environmental governance of rapid industrialization' Environmental Politics, 15(2), 271-292 The business or industrial sectors were only passive subjects regulated by the state, without any interest in compliance beyond state environmental regulations.Ma, X. and Ortolano, L. (2000) 'Environmental Regulation in China. Institution, Enforcement and Compliance' (Lanham, M.D: Rowman and Littlefield) Before the mid-1990s, there existed no truly environmental NGOs in China. There was obviously no presence of a strong civil society to articulate environmental interests and ideas of civil society amongst political and decision-makers or to press for environmental policy implementation in China.Ho, P. (2001) 'Greening without conflict? Environmentalism, NGO and civil society in China', Development and change, 32(5), 893-921 Civil society and victims of industrial pollution could only resort to three channels to safeguard their interests or express their displeasure regarding any environmental conflicts. First, citizens could complain about damages caused by industrial pollution at EPBs at various levels. Second, deputies to the people's congresses and representatives of people's political consultative conferences at the national, provincial, municipal, and country levels could put forward motions and proposals to suspend industrial pollution or compensate victims. Third, individual victims could plea for mediation by environmental authorities in cases of environmental conflicts with industrial polluters, which, in rare instances, resulted in compensation.Shi, H. and Zhang, Lei (2006) 'China's environmental governance of rapid industrialization' Environmental Politics, 15(2), 271-292 State-dominated environmental policy failures For a very long time, Government-Organised NGOs such as the Beijing Environmental Protection Organization and China Environment Fund dominated the environmental ‚Äòcivil society‚Äô sector. They had, and still have more freedom of registration and are able to play major roles in environmental matters due to their less restrictive institutional structure, their expertise and their close links with state agencies.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge These GONGOs articulate environmental interest and bring them into state and market institutions via their closed networks and personal connections with policy makers. In that way, they assume to be bridging the gap between NGOs and civil society on one hand, and the state on the other hand, hence, becoming an important, non-state arena for China's environmental politics.Wu, F. (2002) 'New Partners or old brothers? GONGOs in transitional environmental advocacy', China Environment Series, 5, 45-58 However, by the mid-1990s, it was apparent that the relatively comprehensive environmental regulatory framework established in the late 1970s had failed to prevent the overall degradation of China's environmental quality. According to Shi et al., (2006), there are a number of reasons responsible for the unimpressive performance of China's early environmental regulation. First, China developed its environmental regulation in the 1970s, with little experience and virtually no institutional capacity. This initial environmental regulation was also a model of those of Western countries, but China's international isolation in the 1970s and early 1980s made the learning process difficult and deficient.Jahiel, A. (1998) 'The Organization of environmental protection in China', China Quarterly, 156, 757-787 Second, China lacked a strong environmental state, with large and effective monitoring and enforcement capacity, to oversee the initial regime of industrial environmental pollution control.Wang, H., Bi, J., Wheeler, D., Wang, J., Cao, D., Lu, G. and Wang, Y. (2002) 'Environmental Performance rating and disclosure: China's Green Watch Program', Prpgram Research working paper 2889 (Washington, DC: World Bank) Due to EPBs‚Äô lack of authority, capacity and resources to monitor and enforce industrial environmental compliance, the regime became ineffective in handling and addressing industrial pollution. This is especially true at the town level because as at 2004, there were no environmental monitoring stations and environmental supervision and inspection agencies at the town level.Zang, L. (2002) 'Ecologizing industrialization in Chinese small towns' PhD thesis, Wageningen UniversityShi, H. and Zhang, Lei (2006) 'China's environmental governance of rapid industrialization' Environmental Politics, 15(2), 271-292 Third, the regime was principally designed to target large SOEs within a centrally planned economy via direct command-and-control interventions. The most important basis of the regulation was the concentration-based pollutant discharge standards, and in consequence, all the regulatory programmes were biased in favour of end-of-pipe pollution abatement, which proved technologically unreliable and economically costly in China.Wang, J., Yang, J., Ge, C., Cao, D. and Schreifels (2004) 'Controlling Sulphur dioxide in China: will emission trading work?', Environment 46(5), 28-39 Moreover, the system was ineffective and costly in dealing with the large quantity of emerging small-scale industrial entities, especially the TVEs in rural areas.Zang, L. (2002) 'Ecologizing industrialization in Chinese small towns' PhD thesis, Wageningen University Finally, industry experienced constant and rapid change in the 1990s, both in scale (quantitatively) and in structure (qualitatively). The industrial transformation formed a moving target and it proved difficult to develop a corresponding environmental regulatory systemZang, T. and Chen, J. (2003) 'Industrial environmental management in China', Environment and Change, 45, 129-140 Transition in China‚Äôs environmental governance system: The reorganization of state institutions Chinese state apparatus remains dominantly important in environmental protection and reform. Both the nature of the contemporary Chinese social order and the character of the environment as a public good will safeguard the crucial position of the state in environmental protection and reform for some time.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge Currently articulations of environmental interests have become the sole responsibility of the Environmental Protection Bureaux (EPBs) which is a prominent department at various governmental levels. However, the most common complaints from Chinese and foreign environmental analysts focus precisely on this system of (local) EPBs. It is evident that the local EPBs depend so much on both the higher level environmental authorities and on local governments and as such they have been criticised for their poor environmental capacity (in both qualitative and quantitative terms) and, more generally, for the lack (and distortion) of environmental informationMa, X. and Ortolano, L. (2000) 'Environmental Regulation in China. Institution, Enforcement and Compliance' (Lanham, M.D: Rowman and Littlefield Yet, the system of environmental state organisations in China is showing remarkable changes since the turn of the millennium, of which four deserve mentioning.Mol, APJ. (2009) 'Urban environmental governance innovations in China', Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 1, 96-100 First, the content of China's environmental policy has been modernised and updated. Over the last decade, China has formulated new environmental laws, which include the Cleaner Production Promotion Law (of 2002) [3], the Environmental Information Disclosure Decree (of 2008), the Law on Promoting Circular Economy (of 2009), the new environmental policy instruments, such as voluntary agreementsEichhorts, U. and Bongrardt, D. (2009) 'Towarda cooperative policy approaches in China: Drivers for voluntary agreements on industrial energy efficiency in Nanjing' Energy Policy, 37, 1855-1865 and emission trading.Tao, J. and Mah, D.N. (2009) 'Between markets and states: dilemmas of environmental governance in China's sulphur dioxide emission trading system', Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 27, 175-188 All these laws point at a harmonisation of China's environmental policy with that of OECD countries. However, operating system and mode of implementation of these modern environmental strategies still maintain some of their Chinese characteristics: low fines, an emphasis on promotion rather than regulation, and a complicated division of responsibilities between horizontal and vertical lines.Mol, APJ. (2009) 'Urban environmental governance innovations in China', Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 1, 96-100 Additionally, some typically Chinese environmental policies, such as the three simultaneous principle and the National Environmental Model City program are still intact despite the strong international influence and cooperationMacBean, A. (2007) 'China's environment: Problems and policies', The World Economy, 30(2), 292-307Economy, E. (2006) 'Environmental governance: the emerging economic dimension', Environmental politics, 15(2), 171-189 The second development is that China is moving away from a rigid, hierarchical, command-and control system to a g decentralised and more flexible environmental policy-making and implementation system. Local and provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus and local governments are more prominent in developing environmental priorities, strategies, financial models and institutional arrangements.LoCH-W, and Tang, S-Y. (2006) 'Institutional reform, economic changes and local environmental management in china: the case of Guangdong Province', Environmental Politics, 15(2), 42-62 This has is as a result of past state failures in national environmental policy, though it is seen also as a part of a wider tendencies of less centralised control in Chinese society. The tendency is one towards larger influence and decision- making power by the local authorities and diminishing control by Beijing, both by the central state structures and by the CPC (for example, decentralisation in energy policy.Andrews-Speed, P., Dow, S. and Gao, Z. (1999) 'A provisional evaluation of the 1998 reform to China's government and state sector: the case of the energy industry' Journal of the center for energy, Petroleum and mineral law and Policy, 4(7), 1-11 Proponents of decentralization have argued that decentralised and more flexible environmental policies may be more effective as they can be better adapted to the local physical and socio- economic situation, however citizens perceptions on the (environmental) performance of local urban governments are not very positive.Saich, T. (2007) 'Citizens' Perceptions of governance in rural and Urban China', Journal of Chinese Political Science, 12(1), 1-28 In China, as elsewhere, decentralization does not automatically result in better protection of the environment, as local authorities typically give preference to economic growth and investments over the progressive development of environmental policies and stringent enforcement of environmental regulation and standards.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge Therefore, decentralised policies need to be paralleled by performance measurement, (environmental) auditing and accountability mechanisms, to make sure that local authorities give priority to the environmental concerns of citizens (and not to their own interest). In contemporary China, the Quantitative Examination System for Comprehensive Urban Environmental Control and an emerging environmental auditing system have been developed in this regard.Mol, A.P.J., Carter, N.T. (2006) 'China's environmental governance in transition', Environmental Politics, 15, 149-170Gong, T. (2009) 'Institutionalizing learning and adaptation: developing state audit capacity in China', Public Administration and development, 29, 33-41 They ensure some form of national control, where environmental policy-making and implementation becomes decentralised. The third major development in China's system of environmental governance which is also instrumental to the overall performance of all the decision-makers is the strengthening of the rule of (environmental) law. This can be identified as a modernization in environmental politics, closely tied to the emergence of a market economy.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge The system of environmental laws has led to the setting of environmental quality standards and emission discharge levels. There are signs that the rule of law is taken more seriously in the field of environments and this has been triggered by the opening up of China to the global economy and polity.Ma, X. and Ortolano, L. (2000) 'Environmental Regulation in China. Institution, Enforcement and Compliance' (Lanham, M.D: Rowman and Littlefield) The strengthening of the rule of environmental law goes together with more resources for enforcement,Van Rooij, B. (2006) 'Implementation of Chinese environment law: regular enforcement and political campaigns', Development and Change, 37(1), 57-74 a more formal enforcement style of EPBs, and stronger (financial) punishments of companies. For instance, Courts are getting more involved in enforcement in addition to legal procedures initiated by citizens and environmental NGOs, such as the well-known Centre for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims (CLAPV).Wang, A. (2006) 'The role of law in environmental protection in China: recent development', Vermont Journal of Environmental Law, 8, 195-223 Modes of environmental governance in China Over the last two decades, environmental management in many Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD) countries has shifted, and different authors have used different concepts to characterise these changes. According to Tietenberg (1998) and Khanna (2001) the use of market-based and voluntary instruments in addition to, and sometimes instead of, command and control regulation have evolved. Others have framed the changes in term of a transition from government to governance (e.g. Jordan et al., 2005), emphasising the role of non-state actors in environmental politics. Although the state continues to have a major role in regulating pollution externalities in China's environmental regime, civil society and markets can no longer be ignored or regarded as solely dependent upon the state.Shi, H. and Zhang, Lei (2006) 'China's environmental governance of rapid industrialization' Environmental Politics, 15(2), 271-292 In China's environmental governance system, three main actors and institutions have taken more balanced positions: the state, economic actors and institutions, and civil society. The state represents all the government bodies affecting industrial environmental management, including administrative, legislative, and judicial branches at different levels. Economic actors include industry, investors, customers and financial institutions, which have become increasingly independent from the state. In this article, civil society is defined as a self-organising and coordinating network of societal actors that are relatively independent of control by the state and private sectorCarter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge Markets and Economic Actors Conventionally, centrally planned economies did a poor job in setting the right price signals for a sustainable use of natural resources and a minimisation of environmental pollution.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge With a turn to a social market economy this is changing. In China, environmental protection slowly becomes part of markets, prices and competition, in four ways. First, subsidies on natural resources (such as water and energy) are rapidly being discontinued, turning prices for natural resources towards cost prices. For instance, water prices for citizens, industries and farmers have increased sharply over the past decade, often with 10% or more per year.Webber, M., Barnett, J., Finlayson, B. and Wang, M. (2008) 'Pricing China's irrigation water' Global Environmental Change, 18, 617-625 Likewise, energy prices have equally lost part of their subsidies. Higher energy prices contributed to higher energy efficiencies.Hang, L. and Tu, M. (2007) 'The impacts of energy prices on intensity: evidence from China' Energy Policy, 35(5), 2978-2988 Lower income groups are at times financially compensated for steep price increases. Second, economic incentives, fees and taxes are increasingly used, to influence (economic) decision-making of polluters. Particularly, discharge fees (related to the amount of pollution or the amount of pollution in excess of standards) are common.Ma, X. and Ortolano, L. (2000) 'Environmental Regulation in China. Institutions, Enforcement and Compliance (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield) In 2007 environmental authorities received around 174 billion RMB waste discharge fees, and this amount has been increasing over the past five years with 20‚Äì30% annually. Between 2000 and 2008, the average wastewater treatment charge per m3 in the 36 largest cities increased with almost 300%. (China Statistical Yearbook on Environment, various editions). Fees are higher in heavily polluted and economically developed areas but many small and rural industries still managed to escape payment owing to lack of enforcement.Wang, H. and Wheeler, D. (1999) 'Endogenous Enforcement and Effectiveness of China's Pollution Levy System (Washington, DC: World Bank) In addition to these fees, a growing number of pilot projects on payments for environmental services can be witnessed, where resource consumers are financially compensated for less resource use (or less pollution).Zang, L., Tu, Q., Mol, A.P.J. (2008) 'Payment for environmental services: the sloping land conversion program in Ningxia autonomous region of China' China & World Economy 16(2), 66-81 The third development in the system of environmental governance in China is the increasing involvement of private companies in executing public tasks and services on the environment. For example, urban service provisioning in drinking and wastewater, energy and solid waste management experiences all kinds of new public‚Äìprivate partnership models.Zhong, L., Mol, A.P.J., Fu, T. (2008) 'Public-Private Partnerships in China's urban water sector', Environmental Management, 41, 863-877 Environmental service functions of provincial environmental authorities are also partly privatised and commercialised (such as monitoring, education and information dissemination;Tang, S-Y and Lo CW-H. (2009) The Political economy of service organizational reform in China: an institutional choice analysis' Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Environmental Governance Beyond State and Market: Civil society Apart from direct participation of citizens in the making and implementation of environmental policies, citizens also have enough freedom to organise themselves, express their environmental concerns and set new public agendas for environmental reform in contemporary China.Tang, S-Y, Zhang, X. (2008) 'Civic environment NGOs, Civil society, and democratization in China', Journal of development studies, 44, 425-448 At present, over 10 000 local, provincial and national environmental NGOs exist in China.Mol, APJ. (2009) 'Urban environmental governance innovations in China', Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 1, 96-100 Among them, at least 300 belong to a nationwide loosely connected network of environmental activism by the year of 2010.Fengshi Wu (2013) ‚ÄúEnvironmental Activism in Provincial China: Comparative Evidence from Guangdong and Guangxi,‚Äù Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning, Vol. 15/1: 89-108 These NGOs are often not very adversarial or confrontational; they are experts and awareness-raising organizations, such as Global Village. Some NGOs are very much related to state organisations, such as the popular Government-Organised Non- Governmental Organisations or GONGOsHo, P. (2007) Embedded activism and political change in a semiauthoritarian context', China Information, 12(1), 187-209 The ‚Äòpolitical room‚Äô for a western-style environmental movement still seems limited, but compared to a decade ago this room is expanding. While in some of the Central and East European centrally planned economies, environmental NGOs played a role in articulating environmental and other protests against the ruling social order, in China environmental NGOs have been marginal until now in pushing for environmental reform of the Chinese economy or polity.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J. (2007) Environment Governance in China. London: Routledge International NGOs such as Greenpeace and WWF have invested major efforts in further stimulating the environmental movement in China, with ambivalent successes. Together with economic liberalization, decentralization of decision-making and experiments with local democratization, the pressure from the civil society on local (environmental) authorities to reduce environmental pollution is quite rising.Carter, N.T. and Mol, A.P.J.

At the time of his capture and arrest in March 2012, Naden was reported as being one of Australia's most wanted men and his arrest attracted international media coverage. Naden was in hiding from June 2005 until March 2012, wanted over murder and indecent assault offences. He was the most wanted man in the Australian state of New South Wales. Naden was charged with the January and June 2005 murders of two young women, aggravated indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl in 2004, and shooting with intent to murder a police officer in 2011, while he was on the run. Naden pleaded guilty to all 32 counts against him, and was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 40 years without parole in June 2013. Crimes In June 2005, Kristy Scholes was found strangled to death in the West Dubbo home of her boyfriend's grandparents. A few days later, her boyfriend's cousin, Malcolm Naden, disappeared from that same home. Prior to Scholes' murder, Naden had been named as a suspect in the disappearance of another cousin, Lateesha Nolan, who had been reported missing in January 2005. In December 2005, police closed Western Plains Zoo, Dubbo after Naden was sighted there. There was an additional confirmed sighting of Naden over the next month near Lightning Ridge. In March 2006, Naden avoided capture at an Aboriginal mission, near Condobolin. In January 2007, police placed an 50,000 bounty on his capture. By January 2009, Naden was thought to be located near Kempsey, and by August 2010 he was believed to be living in dense bushland near Gloucester and Scone. By early 2011, the police doubled Naden's bounty to A$100,000, and increased it further again to A$250,000 in December. On 7 December 2011, a police officer from the Tactical Operations Unit was shot by the fugitive during an unsuccessful operation to capture Naden in bushland near Nowendoc. Naden was subsequently charged with the attempted murder of the officer.  Capture  Naden was captured on 22 March 2012 in a run-down cabin approximately west of Gloucester by heavily armed officers from the Tactical Operations Unit in a night operation, and charged with the murder of Scholes. He faced court later that day and was refused bail. On 14 April 2012, Naden was escorted from Goulburn Correctional Centre to Dubbo, where he assisted police by identifying a site at Butlers Falls, south of Dubbo. It was suspected that the remains of his cousin, Lateesha Nolan, are buried at that site, but no remains had been found at that time. Naden was later charged with the murder of Nolan and 14 counts each of burglary and theft committed while on the run. In early December 2016 Police disclosed that remains were found at a location near the site investigated years earlier, which DNA testing confirmed belong to Ms Nolan.  Sentence  In 2013, Naden pleaded guilty to 18 offences including the murders of Scholes and Nolan. He received a minimum prison sentence of 21 years for Nolan's murder, but was given a life sentence for the murder of Scholes. Other charges included the attempted murder of the police officer in 2011, breaking and entering offences and the indecent assault of a 12-year-old girl. Justice Derek Price said Naden had shown no remorse and there was a high risk he would reoffend because he has threatened to kill again, stating that \\"Life outside of prison is not an option for you\\". Naden said \\"thank you, your honour\\" after the sentence was handed down. On 24 November 2013, while serving out his sentence, Naden was bashed by second cousin Dean Nolan, a relative of Lateesha Nolan, who was serving out a 24-year sentence at the time. Nolan, armed with a handle off a sandwich toaster, attacked Naden cracking several blows to Naden's head before being apprehended by prison staff. Nolan was later sentenced to an additional 12 months to his 24-year sentence for the attack on Naden, which he claimed was retribution for the heartache Naden had caused to his family.  Capture dramatised  A dramatised version of the capture of Naden was aired on television on the Seven Network on 11 September 2013. This special television event, an episode of The Force: Behind the Line, presents the full story of \\"Strike Force Durkin\\", providing an insight into the fugitive that previously the viewers were not aware of.

Considered a legend in the Soviet era after the war, he frequently gave speeches to Communist organizations about the war, but he became obscure after the fall of the Soviet Union. Early life Leonov was born on in the city of Zaraysk to a working-class family. From 1931 to 1933, he studied at the school of factory apprenticeship at the Kalibr Plant in Moscow, where he worked as a pattern fitter and combining work with social activities. He also served as the member of the plant committee of the Komsomol, chairman of the workshop committee of inventors and head of the youth brigade. In 1937 he joined the Soviet Navy and was assigned to the Northern Fleet, where he completed a training course in the S.M. Kirov Training Squadron for Diving at the city of Polyarny. He was sent for further service on the submarine Shch-402. World War II Following the start of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, Leonov sent a report on his enrollment in the 181st Separate Reconnaissance Detachment of the Northern Fleet, in which he conducted about 50 combat operations in the rear of the enemy since 18 July 1941. In 1942, he became a member of the Communist Party of Soviet Union. In December 1942, after being awarded an officer rank, he became a commissar, and a year later he was assigned to the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment of the Northern Fleet. In April 1944 he was promoted to lieutenant. In October 1944, during the Petsamo-Kirkenes Offensive, the naval scouts under the command of Leonov landed on the shore occupied by the Wehrmacht, and for two days made their way to the designated point in the harsh off-road conditions, unable to make fire in order to warm up and prepare food. On the morning of October 12, they suddenly attacked the 88-mm battery at Cape Krestovoy. They managed to capture it and also capture a large number of Nazi soldiers. When a boat with a Nazi soldiers attempted to make landing towards their position, Leonov along with a detachment of Ivan Barchenko- Yemelyanov repulsed the attacks, and captured about 60 enemy soldiers. This battle ensured the success of the Soviet landing in Liinakhamari, which led to capture of the port and city by Soviet forces. Thus, Leonov's detachment, by its actions, created favorable conditions for the landing of Soviet troops in the ice-free port of Liinakhamari and the subsequent liberation of Petsamo and Kirkenes. For doing so he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for the first time on 5 November 1944. After the defeat of Nazi Germany on May 1945, Leonov was assigned to the Far East where he took part in the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War in August 1945. As a front-line intelligence officer attached to the 140th Separate Reconnaissance Detachment of the Soviet Pacific Fleet headquarters, the unit under his command took part in the amphibious landing of the Soviet troops into Japanese-occupied Korea, where they landed at the port cities of Rajin-guyok, Chongjin and Wonsan, which are located at the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula. At the port city of Wonsan, the naval scouts under Leonov's command were credited with capturing and disarming 200 officers and 3500 soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army in addition to capturing three artillery batteries, five aircraft and several ammunition depots. Leonov received the title Hero of the Soviet Union for the second time on 14 September 1945. Later life After the war, Leonov continued his military service in the Northern Fleet and in the Central Office of the Soviet Navy. In 1950 he graduated from the Caspian Higher Naval Red Banner School named after Sergei Kirov in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, and in 1952, he was promoted to Captain 2nd Rank. From 1953 to 1956, he was a student of the Voroshilov Naval Academy in Leningrad, and graduated from the second year of the academy. In July 1956, he was transferred to the reserve. From 1957 to 1987, he worked as an engineer at the Research Institute of Petroleum Engineering in Moscow. He died in Moscow on 7 October 2003 and was buried in the Leonovskoye Cemetery.

On May 22, 1934 at the University of Southern California, the scientist Robert E. Cornish succeeded in surgically and chemically restoring life to a dead dog. Eugene Frenke created a film record of the operation and developed a film that would incorporate the footage. Frenke contacting Universal Studios to split costs and profits on the film. Release After finishing Life Returns, director Eugene Frenke pressed Universal Studios to make a follow-up film in which a dead man is brought back to life. The specific release date of Life Returns is unknown. Universal released the film for a special road show run and following a preview screening, Universal pulled the film from a general release and declared the it to be a \\"freak picture, not suitable for the regular Universal program\\" Reviews for the film were published between 1934 and 1935, no release date from these years has been confirmed. In 1937, Frenke brought a $145,424 lawsuit against Universal charging that the studio had not released Life Returns through regular channels. The earliest documented release date is 10 June 1938 where it was distributed by a distributor called Scienart Pictures. The film is the public domain in the United States and has various VHS and DVD releases. Karl Freund contacted Frenke for a print of Life Returns, which led to Frenke to get a new print struck and showed it to his friend. Frenke found out later that Freund asked to view to the film to help him with his own feature Mad Love. Reception From contemporary reviews, The Film Daily reviewed the film on January 2, 1935 and stated that the direction on the film was \\"excellent\\" and that Onslow Stevens and George Breakston \\"give fine performances\\" and the film has \\"been delicately handled and is not offensive or gruesome.\\" \\"Barn.\\" of Variety found the film \\"tedious\\" and that \\"every performance is plodding, colorless, and it's a pic much longer to the audience than its accredited running time would indicate.\\" A review in Harrison's Reports stated the film's story was \\"simple\\" \\"and \\"should appeal more to juveniles than adults\\" and that \\"the fault lies with the director; it is slow and stilted.\\" From retrospective review, the authors of the book Universal Horrors, the authors stated that Life Returns has \\"a slapdash, slung-together quality that pits it at the level of some of the worst of that era's cheap indie productions - in fact, below that level. It has the low-grade look and feel of a film consisting solely of first takes, good, bad and indifferent.\\" References Footnotes Sources   External links  1930s science fiction films English-language films American black-and-white films Universal Pictures films American science fiction films American films ","title":"Life Returns"},{"id":"34196819","text":"Primary care ethics is the study of the everyday decisions that primary care clinicians make, such as: how long to spend with a particular patient, how to reconcile their own values and those of their patients, when and where to refer or investigate, how to respect confidentiality when dealing with patients, relatives and third parties. All these decisions involve values as well as facts and are therefore ethical issues. These issues may also involve other workers in primary healthcare, such as receptionists and managers. Primary care ethics is not a discipline; it is a notional field of study which is simultaneously an aspect of primary health care and applied ethics. De Zulueta argues that primary care ethics has ‚Äòa definitive place on the ‚Äòbioethics map‚Äô, represented by a substantial body of empirical research, literary texts and critical discourse (2, 9, 10). The substantial body of research referred to by De Zulueta (9) has a tendency to be issue-specific, such as to do with rationing(11), confidentiality, medical reports, or relationships with relatives. Much of the literature on primary care ethics concerns primary care physicians. The term primary care physician is synonymous with family practitioner, or general practitioner; meaning a medically qualified clinician who is the first point of access to health care, with general responsibilities which may but do not necessarily include child health or obstetrics and gynaecology. Other primary care clinicians; nurses, physiotherapists, midwives, and in some situations pharmacists may face similar issues, and some (confidentially, prioritisation of patients) may also involve administrative staff. In some healthcare systems primary care specialists may also encounter many of these issues.  The place of primary care ethics in bioethics  Although the ethical decisions made in primary care are often as less dramatic than those in high-tech medicine (1), their cumulative effect may be profound (2), because of the vast number of health care encounters which take place in primary care, (approximately 400.3 million in England in 2008 alone (3, 4) ). Each of these involves ethical judgements, occasionally difficult, often straightforward; often deliberate but more often unconscious. Also, since primary care is often the first step in the patient journey, small decisions made then may make big differences later on. Most of the bioethical literature however deals with tertiary medicine, and much less attention is paid to the daily concerns of primary care physicians and members of the primary care team (5). In countries with well developed primary health care, patients often stay with the same practice for many years, allowing practices to gather a large amount of information and to develop personal relationships over time. Patients often see the same clinician for a variety of problems, at once or at different times. Whole families may see the same doctors and nurses, who may also be their friends and neighbours. These factors affect moral decisions in primary care, and raise ethical dilemmas which might not occur often in secondary and tertiary medical care (6, 7). Moreover, the transfer into the community of services previously provided in hospital (such as specialist chronic disease management and mental health) may lead to the ethical dilemmas arising which were previously only encountered in secondary care (8). Spicer and Bowman argue that the ‚Äòtertiary‚Äô level ethical problems that dominate so much of the debate about healthcare ethics, such as genetics, cloning, organ donation and research, are experienced entirely differently in primary care. Moreover, what might be argued to be core moral principles, such as autonomy and justice, may be reinterpreted when viewed through the lens of primary care (13). Toon, by contrast argues such re- interpretations are not exclusive to general practice and primary care. Doctors in other specialities (such as psychiatry, rheumatology, HIV medicine, where specialists take primary responsibility for a patient‚Äôs health care over a considerable period) may perform what he terms the interpretative function, but when then do so they are acting as generalists and practising generalism (14). The extension of this argument is that it is not just good primary care physicians who are aware of the ethics of the everyday, but good clinicians (15).  Values of primary care  According to Toon (16), doctors in primary care are charged with three tasks: 1\\\\. To deliver the best possible, evidence based medical care to patients who have physical or mental illnesses that can be understood and treated or cured within a biomedical framework 2\\\\. Insofar as it lies within their power, to help prevent avoidable illness and death in their patients 3\\\\. To help those who are or who believe themselves to be ill to cope with their illnesses, real or feared, to the best of their ability and so to achieve their maximum potential as human beings. The first two tasks largely involve understanding the patient as a biopsychosocial system that the doctor is seeking to influence, whilst the third involves seeing the patient as a fellow human being in need. Reconciling these tasks is not easy.  Gatekeeping  In many health-care systems patients can only see specialists by referral from doctors in primary care, a system which restricts access to secondary care and is often called ‚Äúprimary care gatekeeping‚Äù. Although historically in some countries this developed as a mutually beneficial arrangement between specialists and primary care doctors, rather than from a desire to improve patient care, it is widely recognised that it benefits both individual patients and the health care system. Individual patients benefit from having a personal doctor who can integrate their health care and view their problems together rather than in isolation, and who can protect them from over-investigation and over-treatment -which Toon characterises as the 'furor therapeuticus' of specialist medicine (16). Patients as a whole benefit because the system ensures that expensive secondary care resources are spent on those who have the greatest need. Some people however are concerned that gatekeeping can damage the doctor-patient relationship, since the doctor cannot act solely in the interests of the individual patient (17). Others have questioned whether this is ever possible, even without gatekeeping. Much depends on the system within which gatekeeping operates, and how great the pressures are on the primary care doctor not to refer, and how strong the incentives, personal, professional and financial are for or against referral. All are agreed that ‚Äúpositive gatekeeping‚Äù in which doctors are rewarded for encouraging patients to have unnecessary or dubious procedures, as exists in many private systems, is unethical, and that avoiding unnecessary treatment (therapeutic parsimony) is desirable. Heath has pointed out that the primary care doctor has influence over two other ‚Äúgates‚Äù between illness and health, and between self care and professional care (18).  Certification and confidentiality  It is traditional in many countries that primary care doctors issue certificates to allow patients to be absent from work for reasons of sickness. In some countries such certificates are required even for one day‚Äôs absence from work, and this can form a considerable part of the primary care doctor‚Äôs workload. In other countries these certificates are only needed for longer periods of illness. In either case this can function can pose ethical problems for doctors as they try to reconcile a duty to do the best for the patient, a duty not to lie to employers, and the need to maintain the doctor patient relationship for professional and/or financial reasons. Many people want information on patients‚Äô health, and are prepared to pay for it. Insurance companies, employers, social agencies such as the police and the courts and many other bodies have interests in the health status of individuals. The primary care physician is often best placed to provide this information, but doing so can pose ethical problems, particularly in respect of confidentiality. Although patients may sign a consent form to allow information to be released, this consent is not always free, since the patient is often in a position where it would be difficult to refuse, and/or it is not informed, in that patients are often given forms to consent to the release of medical records without what this means being properly explained to them. Doctors can face a conflict of interest in this situation, since they can benefit financially from the fees paid for the release of such information. This poses a difficult ethical conflict as the doctor tries to ‚Äúserve two masters‚Äù; the patient who has a right to confidentiality and the employer or other agency that is paying for the information. Confidentiality has been identified as a key concern to general practitioners in the UK and has been described as one way in which they display their commitment to patient- centeredness (19).  Access and use of time  As the first point of contact with health services, primary care doctors have particular responsibilities with respect to access. Patients typically and understandably want to see the doctor of their choice at the time and place of their choosing, without waiting, and for the length of time they feel they require; however it is rarely possible for all these conditions to be met. The decisions that doctors make about how best to reconcile these conflicting demands by appointment arrangements, arrangements for emergency consultation etc. have a strong ethical as well as practical component. So too do decisions doctors make about the allocation of their time and resources between different problems and different patients. The three aspects of general practice are mentioned above but even within these doctors make choices that are ethical. One doctor may give priority to the care of patients with diabetes, another to women‚Äôs health, and a third to psychological problems and so on. In some countries it is common place for doctors to strike ‚Äì in others this is seen as unethical. This again depends on the values that doctors espouse, and in this case in particular on doctors' understanding of the nature of the doctor patient relationship.  The doctor, the patient and the family  A characteristic feature of primary care is that doctors‚Äô often care for several patients who are related to each other. They also often care for a number of individuals and families who live and/or work in close proximity, and whose lives are intimately related to each other. Particularly though not exclusively in rural areas, the same applies to the doctor and to his staff. This can be a considerable strength of general practice, since doctors gain a fuller understanding of the social context in which their patients live and become ill. It can also pose ethical problems, however particularly in conflicts between duties to different individuals ‚Äì family members, employers and employees, and even between friends, when the illness of one affects the life or health of another. Confidentiality can also be a problem, as patients may not understand or accept that information given to the doctor by one family member may not be divulged to others. Respect for confidentiality, and maintaining confidence amongst patients that confidentiality is respected can be difficult not just for doctors but also for other members of their staff in such situations.  Analysing ethical issues in primary care  As in other aspects of applied ethics, different approaches may be used to understand these problems; they may be seen in terms of the rights and duties involved in medical practice, or how to maximise the good through the work clinicians do, or in terms of the virtues needed to flourish as a clinician or a patient. Deciding which moral framework to apply brings primary care ethics into contact with meta-ethics and epistemology. There is increasing interest in the empirical study of primary care ethics, often using qualitative research methods, which raises important metaethical and methodological questions about the relationship between facts and values.

In 2012 during an interview on Egypt's Dream TV, el-Erian called on former Egyptian Jews who had immigrated to Israel and their descendants to return to Egypt, and called for all Israeli Jews to return to their countries of origin, be it \\"Poland, Egypt, or anywhere\\", and also called for the return of Palestinian refugees. el-Erian stated that although his party was against Zionism, it was not against the Jews, stating that \\"they have a complicated history, but the Jewish motherland is not Israel\\". In response to el-Erian's comments, a lawsuit was filed on grounds that he was spreading false information potentially harmful to national security while in a position of responsibility, by inferring that Arab Jews are responsible for \\"occupying Palestine\\". Imprisonment and death el-Erian was arrested in 1981, during the famous September arrests that specifically targeted members of Islamist groups in large numbers. He was then tried in a military court for the members of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was imprisoned from 1995‚Äì2000, for a span of five years.

Observatory In 2011, the Society set up a sub-committee to seek a suitable site - remote from city lighting, yet within easy reach of Campbelltown/Camden - at which to locate its first astronomical observatory. In 2012, a suitable site was identified in the Dharawal National Park and the Society is pursuing opportunities to secure use of the site. The location was until recently the site of the North Cliff coal mine, operated by BHP Billiton. Whilst anticipating some opposition to placing an observatory in a national park, the Society was inspired by the Australian Astronomical Observatory in the Warrumbungles National Park and the concept has received much local support. If successful, the observatory will be used for astronomical research, public outreach, astro-imaging and members private observing. Distributed computing The Society organises a Citizen Science team for the purpose of carrying out scientific research using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) Project Management middleware platform, which allows users to contribute to a range of scientific computing projects at the same time. Distributed computing is often also referred to as Citizen Science, Volunteer Computing or Grid Computing. The team is currently working as volunteers on projects for theSkyNet, SETI@home, Einstein@home, asteroids@home, LHC@home and other BOINC projects.

The reviewer said, \\"This somewhat meditative treatment runs the risk of distancing the viewer. One can see the influence of the Japanese master Akira Kurosawa's Dreams and South Korean director Kim Ki Duk's Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring here. One can also see that leaving the characters nameless is becoming Dr Biju's stamp: every character was nameless in his previous film Veettilekkulla Vazhi.

He is best known under his ring name, Hiram Tua, which he has used in several of Puerto Rico's promotions, including the International Wrestling Association, the World Wrestling Council and the World Wrestling League. Career Early career Mulero began his career in the independent promotion, Caribbean Wrestling Association. His first gimmick being that of a Samoan wrestler named Airan Anoy Tua. It was in this company that he won his first two titles, the CWA Cruiserweight Championship and the CWA Tag Team Championship with Roger D√≠az. Continuing to perform in the independent circuit, Mulero entered the Extreme Wrestling Organization, where he first adopted the ring name Hiram Tua. His gimmick was the \\"owner of space\\", which emphasized aerial style wrestling. He also wrestled in the Puerto Rico Wrestling Association. Mulero debuted in the International Wrestling Association on November 4, 2005, wrestling against D√≠az in a losing effort. His first win took place a month after in a mixed tag team match. He wrestled D√≠az twice during the following month, losing both contests. Mulero's first singles victory was over Armando Gorbea on January 14, 2006. Throughout the rest of the year he continued competing on alternate dates, challenging cruiserweights with mixed results. On November he entered a tournament for the IWA Cruiserweight Championship, but was eliminated in the opening round. At Histeria Boricua 2007, Mulero was teamed with D√≠az in a 3 on 3 match. Due to their ability to perform flashy aerial maneuvers, Jack Melendez decided to book them as a tag team that eventually became known as Los Aereos. Mulero occasionally wrestled in single contests even winning the Hardcore Championship on January 27, 2007, despite being mostly a tag team contender. On February 3, 2007, the team was officially named following a contest with then main eventer Joe Bravo. The following week, Mulero dropped the title. In April 2007, Los Aereos entered a feud with NWA Tag Team Champions, Los Luchas. Their subsequent feud was with top heel faction La Revoluci√≥n Dominicana, which saw them unsuccessfully challenging for the IWA World Tag Team Championship in a ladder match. In a rematch, Los Aereos won the titles. Los Aereos continued rising in the tag team division, eventually entering a feud with the Naturals, dropping the belts. After failing to regain them from the Naturals, they defeated Los Due√±os de la Malicia, Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodr√≠guez, for the first contenders spot, but once again lost the titular match. On October 13, 2007, he won the Cruiserweight Championship, holding on to it until leaving it vacant. The angle with La Malicia continued until early 2008, when Los Aereos left the IWA following an event that broke the promotion's administration in two conflicting bands, Miguel Per√©z against Mario Savoldi. Los Aereos remained inactive for several months, until Tua joined EWO for a brief stint. On October 31, 2008, they debuted in the World Wrestling Council. The team entered a short feud against The Texas Outlaws upon arriving in the promotion, which saw them lose a first contenders match for the WWC World Tag Team Championship. This was followed by a series of contests with Gorbea and Ricky Reyes, which saw both teams trade victories. Upon defeating Gorbea and Reyes in a rubber match, Los Aereos went on to unsuccessfully challenge Thunder and Lightning for the championship. On July 26, 2009, Mulero turned on D√≠az, adopting a heel persona known as \\"El Due√±o del Espacio\\" Hiram Tua, a throwback to his EWO gimmick. He entered a feud with D√≠az before joining Orlando Col√≥n in a stable, which saw both of them portray a single character, La Pesadilla. Following Aniversario 2009, where Col√≥n lost his mask, the two created a tag team that became known as Los Traidores. He continued to feud with D√≠az, eventually being revealed as La Sombra. However, their partnership was short lived and Los Aereos eventually reunited as a face team. This was followed by a feud against Idol Stevens and King Tonga Jr., who had won the titles. Los Aereos won the Championships from them on April 10, 2010, dropping them back a three weeks later. The final match of this angle took place at Aniversario 2010, in which they were victorious. Subsequently, both were separated in order to pursue single storylines. Mulero feuded with Jos√© \\"Black Pain\\" Torres and Hideo Saito for the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship, but eventually faded from WWC programming. Mulero's next appearance was in the IWA, where he challenged Noel Rodr√≠guez, losing an IWA Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship eliminatory. Immediately afterwards, he entered a feud with Eric P√©rez, which extended for several months. On April 2, 2011, Mulero defeated P√©rez to win his first IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Mulero then joined a group led by Savio Vega, who invaded WWC's Aniversario 2011 in the first interpromotional angle between both companies. He held on to the title for four months, eventually entering a feud against an stable known as the Academy. At Summer Attitude, he dropped the title to Academy member and undefeated Intercontinental Champion, Chris Angel. Later in the same event, he was among the wrestlers that defended the IWA from a counter-invasion from WWC's talent. A month later, Mulero was fired from the IWA by Miguel P√©rez as part of a storyline. He subsequently explained this action, stating that he intended to retire from the Puerto Rican circuit in order to pursue an international wrestling career. Mulero completed previous compromises with independent companies EWO and New Professional Wrestling to conclude his local run. He was ranked in the 150th slot in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's 2011 PWI 500, making him the highest rated wrestler that competed exclusively in Puerto Rico that year. On November 11, 2011, he made his foreign debut for East Coast Professional Wrestling. Mulero won this contest, going over Billy Daly. He returned to ECPW on April 13, 2012, participating in a three-way match, he picked the pinfall following a shooting star press after throwing his second opponent outside the ring. In early 2012, Mulero became tied to Amaro Productions, who went on to form a stable that also included D√≠az. He abandoned his local retirement for one night, briefly reforming Los Aereos in a charity card named \\"Un Junte para la Historia\\". Mulero returned to New Jersey in autumn, wrestling there for National Pro Wrestling Superstars on October 26‚Äì27, 2012. On his first date, he teamed with Frankie Flow to face a team known as Absolutely Latino. Mulero defeated \\"The Latin Lover\\" Chachi in a singles match the following night. On June 8, 2013, Mulero performed in La Guerra, an event held prior to the Puerto Rican Day Parade, defeating Bestia 666. World Wrestling League (2014-2016) Mulero returned to local wrestling on December 13, 2014 on Navidad Corporativa, aiding El Sensacional Carlitos, by attacking Mr. 450, but later turning on Carlitos by attacking him. On January 6, 2015 in Guerra De Reyes, he interfered in a match between El Sensacional Carlitos and Mr. 450, costing Carlitos the match by pushing the ladder and throwing Carlitos of the top rope. On August 15, 2015, \\"El Sensacional\\" Carlitos and \\"El Due√±o del Mundo\\" Hiram T√∫a faced off to determine the First Mega Champion of the TV of the WWL. Both Carlitos and T√∫a, launched their entire arsenal of movements. T√∫a ended up winning and being the First Mega Champion of the TV of the WWL. Tua performing the shooting star press on P√©rez. Health issues (2018) On September 26, 2018, Mulero announced that he was forced to take \\"Time Off\\" from Wrestling due to \\"health issues\\" which forced him to cancel appearances for CWA and CKCW among others. A reunion of Los A√©reos scheduled for November would mark his final match. On October 3, 2018, Mulero (who had back problems preceding his career). With his future in wrestling still uncertain, Mulero saw action at Hugo Savinovich's MysterMan√≠a winning an obstentible opportunity for the Wrestling Superstar World Tag Team Championship along Star Roger. Mulero entered a hiatus while recovering from his back injury. His prognosis improved, allowing him to return to the ring. CWA (2019) Tua got medically cleared and joined the CWA full-time. Tua restarted his rivalry against Star Roger, formerly known as El Sensacional Carlitos, which ended up with them teaming up to challenge the CWA Tag Team Champions, Los Fugitivos Alejandro Niche Marrero and Wilfredo Lynx Rivera. On CWA Aniversario 11, on July 20 2019, The Aereos, Hiram Tua and Star Roger defeat Los Fugitivos and became the new CWA Tag Team Champions.

(29 September 1538 ‚Äì 10 July 1603) was presbyter of Vic, auxiliary bishop of Morocco (1575‚Äì1579), bishop of Elne (1579‚Äì1586) and of Tortosa (1586‚Äì1587), and archbishop of Tarragona (1587‚Äì1603). He was viceroy of Catalonia (1602‚Äì1603) and councillor of King Philip III of Spain. Early years He was born in Verd√∫ (Lleida, Spain) to a humble Christian family in 1538.However, Capeille, op. cit., p. 610, states that he was born in 1539. Son of Joan Ter√®s Dom√®nech and Magdalena Borrull Carnicer, and brother of Magdalena, Joana, Elionor and Margarida. During his teenage years, he lived in Reus, where he studied grammar while he begged to pay his studies. In 1554, he went to the School of Tarragona where he studied Latin and humanities, paying his studies with the short salary from delivering letters. Due to his talent, he got good protection and stimulus. Later, he was sent to study philosophy and theology to a school that the Society of Jesus founded in Spain, the Saint Paul School in Valencia, where he finally completed his doctorate studies. Academic life In 18 April 1566 he asked for a deferment to pay taxes for his doctorate in theology, which was granted. It is very probable that he passed in his first try, since there are no other registered deferments in the following years. Since 1532, the payment to get the title of doctor was 7 pounds and 10 sous (or 1 800 dineros).1 Valencian pound = 20 sous; 1 sou = 12 dineros. Archbishop of Valencia Juan de Ribera appointed Joan Ter√®s as rector of the University of Valencia. During the 1566‚Äì1567 academic year he was permanent professor of the second chair of Logic and for that he received 5 Valencian pounds out of the 500 that Pope Pius IV gave to the Studium generale of Valencia. On 15 March 1567 he was proposed for the second chair of Questions for the 1567‚Äì1568 academic year. In 1570-1571 he got the first chair of Questions and in 1571-1572 the first one of Philosophy. Logic, Questions and Philosophy, either in their realist or nominalist perspective, made up the Arts triad at the Faculty of Arts in cycles of three years. Professors usually taught a full triad starting with Logic in any of the modalities. Once finished either the nominalist or the realist cycle, they started with the one which they had not read before. For this reason, although there is evidence that Ter√®s was chair in the mentioned courses, it is highly probable that he also took the second chair (nominalist) of Philosophy in 1568-1569 and the first chair (realist) of Logic in 1569‚Äì1572. Therefore, he would have completed a six-year period as a chair in the Faculty of Arts from 1566 until 1572. Besides being professor, Joan Ter√®s was examiner at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Valencia as well. In 16 February 1565 he was named assistant professor and substitute for examiner Vicente Monta√±√©s, chair at the Faculty of Arts. Usually, the assistant replaced the examiner in case of death or resignation. Nowhere is stated that Ter√®s got the position, but there is evidence that Juan Tom√°s was proposed as his assistant in 5 July 1571. Two years later, in 4 March 1573, Ter√®s, who was already living in Tarragona, resigned the position and Juan Tom√°s was replaced by Juan Tom√°s. Due to the order of imprisonment of the rector of the University of Valencia for 1568‚Äì1571, Pere Joan Monz√≥, by archbishop of Valencia Juan de Ribera, in 31 March 1570, Ter√®s was appointed new rector, when the archbishop forced Monz√≥ to delegate his position to Ter√®s. The archbishop's original plans were to give the positions of chair of theology to members of the order he belonged to: the Society of Jesus. Since the rector was elected among the chairs of the Faculty of Theology by sortition and he had a vital role in the appointment of the rest of the academic positions, it would not be surprising that in a short time the Jesuits had taken control over the institution. Therefore, it is understandable that the chosen one to replace Pere Monz√≥ was somebody who had a similar academic qualification to be elected rector, and had the advantage of being a former student of the Jesuit School of Saint Paul. In regard of his intellectual legacy, it is worth mentioning that he was the professor of the Spanish philosopher Diego Mas, who dedicated two of his works to Ter√®s: * Metaphysica disputatio seu de ente et de eius propietatibus, quae communi nomine scribitur de trascendentibus (Valencia, 1587) * Commentaria in Universam Philosophia Aristotelis, una cum quaestionibus quae a gravissimis viris disputari solent (Valencia, 1599) Early ecclesiastical career He went back to Tarragona and hold a benefice at the cathedral of Tarragona that allowed him to live without economical problems. In 1570, the archbishop of Tarragona Gaspar Cervantes de Gaeta was appointed cardinal, keeping his position as archbishop of Tarragona. When he moved to Italy, Ter√®s took care of the ecclesial matters of the archdiocese. On 4 February 1575, Ter√®s was consecrated by Archbishop Cervantes. That year the Seminary of Tarragona, the first one in Spain, was founded according to the regulations of the Council of Trent. Ter√®s was its first rector. Later that year, Cardinal Cervantes proposed him to be auxiliary bishop with the nominal title of Morocco, with which the Pope agreed. In 1577, the University of Tarragona was officially institutionalized, and in 2 May of that year Ter√®s was appointed rector of that university by Archbishop Antonio Agust√≠n. He also was chair of Theology at the new institution. In 22 May 1579, Pope Gregory XIII sent him to the diocese of Elne, since the previous bishop, Pedro M√°rtir Coma, died. Ter√®s took up the post in 26 July of that year. In 12 December 1582, Maria of Austria, widow of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was going back to Spain, and her daughter Margaret arrived to Collioure. When they stopped in Elne, Ter√®s visited the Empress. In Christmas day, Ter√®s celebrated a mass in the church of Saint John of Perpignan, in the presence of the Holy Roman Empress, the Princess and the whole court. In the second semester of 1585, Ter√®s participated in the Courts of Monz√≥n. In early June 1586, he received the nomination bulls from Pope Sixtus V for the diocese of Tortosa.Dictionnaire de biographies roussillonnaises - T (1914) by Joan Capeille As bishop of Tortosa, he consecrated the parochial temple of Verd√∫ on 15 June 1586. In 22 May 1587, Pope Sixtus V assigned him to the archdiocese of Tarragona, after the death of archbishop Antonio Agust√≠n. Archbishop of Tarragona Archbishop Ter√®s commanded the construction of the chapel of Saint Fructuosus of the Tarragona Cathedral to Pere Blai. As archbishop, Ter√®s founded the monastery of Saint Dominic in Ciutadilla, in 1588. He collaborated in the improvements of the monastery of Saint Mary of Bovera in Guimer√†, and in the hermitage of Saint Mag√≠ of Brufaganya, near Santa Coloma de Queralt. In 1589, he got for Tarragona the publication of the privilege of Studium Generale, granted by Philip II of Spain. This was celebrated with rejoicing and public festivities all around the city. In 1591, Ter√®s granted privileges of baptismal fonts to la Riba, due to the difficulty that represented for the villagers to go to Vilaverd. In 1592, Ter√®s ordered to build, in the cathedral of Tarragona, the chapels of Saint John the Evangelist and Saint Fructuosus, to the Renaissance architect Pere Blai. In 13 August of that same year, Pope Clement VIII approved a Papal bull decreeing the annulment and secularization of the regular canons of the Order of Saint Augustine in all the monasteries and priories of Catalonia, Roussillon and Cerdanya, due to the dissolute life style of some communities of that order. The pope commissioned the execution of the bull to the archbishop of Tarragona, the bishop od Urgel Andreu Capella (who was Ter√®s's professor in theology) and the Apostolic Nuncio to Spain Pietro Millino. Later, archbishop Ter√®s sent his nephew and vicar general of the archdiocese of Tarragona, Antoni Clarass√≥ i Ter√®s, to read the bull to the canons gathered in Solsona. From that moment on, they were left secularized and deprived of the canonical insignias. While some monasteries had complied with the order of secularization, the monastery of Saint Mary of Solsona resisted, basing their reasons on the second Papal bull in which Clement VIII stated that if the canons demonstrated an exemplary behavior, they could continue enjoying their position and benefice. The budget of the secularized monasteries went to Solsona. Then, the Solsonians addressed to King Philip II to create a new diocese, with Solsona as the Episcopal see, using the new extended income and the monastery as a residence. Once the pope agreed with the king's petition, Philip II informed of the approval of the Pope, and granted the ranked of city in 13 June 1594. The creation of the diocese of Solsona caused serious unrest among the neighbouring dioceses because they saw their possessions diminished, especially in Urgel. Ter√®s, the bishop of Urgell and the new Apostolic Nuncio Camillo Caetani were commissioned to erect the new diocese. After examining the life style and habits of the regular canons and declaring them free of guilt, they sent personal decrees to all of them, granting them the rights and benefice for their lifetime. Finally, Ter√®s took part in the formation of the cathedral chapter, and later, in the delimitation of the new diocese, together with the abbot of Poblet and President of Catalonia Francesc Oliver de Boteller. In 18 September 1594, Ter√®s travelled on board, escorted by eight galleys, to the island of Ibiza, then territory of the archdiocese of Tarragona. During the trip, the expedition was assaulted by three Muslim pirate galleys. Finally, the archbishop's galleys took over two pirate ships. He protected several orders of friars, like the Capuchins, the Augustinians and the Carmelites, and he notably improved the monastery of the Jesuits. While being archbishop he celebrated and presided the provincial ecumenical councils of 1587, 1591‚Äì92, 1598 y 1602. On 4 April 1596, Ter√®s proceeded to the recognition ceremony of the sepulcher of the Blessed Raymond of Penyafort, who later Ter√®s promoted his canonization, by archbishop Ter√®s, the bishop of Barcelona, Joan Dimas Loris,and the bishop of Vic, Pere Jaume, all three commissioned by Pope Clement VIII. There were also present the bishop of Elne, Francesc Robuster i Sala, the recently appointed first bishop of Solsona, Llu√≠s San√ß i Manegat, and the deputies of Catalonia and consuls of Barcelona. Ter√®s also promoted the beatification of the founder of the Society of Jesus, Ignatius of Loyola. In 1602, the petronel-armed bandits Pere Voltor and Miquel Catal√† killed Royal commissioner Epifani Olives i Ter√®s, the archbishop's nephew, in the Castle of Valls. The jurors of Valls and many prominent authorities of the city were declared accomplices by the Royal Audience of Catalonia. This made the relations between the authorities of Valls and Ter√®s very tense.Valls in Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana Online Ter√®s alerted the bishops not to tolerate preaching in languages other than their mother tongue. He also promoted the art of printing in Tarragona. Viceroy of Catalonia Constitutions of the Catalan Courts celebrated in Barcelona in 1599. In 1599, the King Philip III of Spain attended a session at the Catalan Courts. Ter√®s, still archbishop, presided the ecclesiastical arm. After every session, the agreements achieved were usually printed, but that time there were five articles with which the deputies could not come to an agreement. Among them, the right of the viceroy to make proclamations and the deprivation for nobles and their servants of carrying petronels, in order to suppress banditry in Catalonia. The then viceroy of Catalonia, Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figueroa y C√≥rdoba, duke of Feria, interpreted the protest as an act of disobedience and replied ordering the imprisonment of a deputy and the Courts comptroller. This event was the reason why the duke was thrown out of charge. On 16 April 1602, he was replaced by Ter√®s. The highly delicate circumstances drove Philip III to assign Ter√®s as a mean of appeasement. He was well known by the king from his assistantship at the Courts in 1599. Moreover, that same year, the king and his wife Margaret of Austria stayed at the Archbishop's Palace of Tarragona for three days. At the end of 1602, one of the murderers of Ter√®s's nephew, Pere Voltor, was captured in a raid. Later that year he was sentenced to death and chopped into pieces. Ter√®s decreed the release of the deputies imprisoned by the duke of Feria and published the Constitutions without the conflictive articles. He was strongly opposed to the manufacture of petronels, especially in a country where in just one year more than 300 people were killed by this firearm.A Carn! num.9, January 2009, pag.4 Finally he decided to face the nobles. In 1603, Ter√®s prohibited the production of petronels to the blacksmiths. This move did not prove satisfactory to the deputies and bothered the aristocracy. When another protest came up, Ter√®s offered to study this matter again. As viceroy, Ter√®s, who was openly a nyerro, actively took part in the disputes between nyerros and cadells, thus disregarding the obligations of his position.Nyerro in Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana Online The viceroy, without political ambitions and impatient to return to his ecclesiastical tasks, asked for a replacement. King Philip III accepted his petition and on 19 May 1603 he designated the duke of Monteleone, Ettore Pignatelli e Colonna, as the new viceroy. Death and legacy Before transferring the powers to the next viceroy, archbishop Ter√®s died on 10 July 1603However, Boleda i Cases (1982), op. cit., p. 19, mentions two other possible dates of death, 6 and 16 July. in the Palace of the Lieutenant, in Barcelona, at age 64.Parochial Archive of Verd√∫ Although the causes of his death were not clear, it has been rumored that he had been poisoned. His testimonial executor was his nephew Antoni Clarass√≥ i Ter√®s. In 1610, his remains were taken and escorted by the Spanish squad to Tarragona, and finally buried between the chapels of Saint Fructuosus and Saint John, where he always had his confessional. His altruist character was perpetuated by a pious foundation for unmarried ladies of his lineage. He left money for school fees at the Seminary of Tarragona, for poor students of his lineage and from la Selva del Camp. He still left more for other seven poor students that wanted to take the ecclesiastical path, with preference for natives from Verd√∫. And finally, another foundation for provide money annually to three chosen girls from Tarragona, la Selva del Camp and Constant√≠. He was also remembered as the benefactor of two orphanages, for boys and girls, in Tarragona since, at least, 1551. Archbishop Ter√®s street in Verd√∫ (Spain) is named after him.

It was later converted to a heavy bomber squadron that operated from bases in the Mediterranean from January 1944 until the end of the war. On conclusion of hostilities, the Squadron was used to ferry liberated POW's from Italy back to Britain and disbanded South African troops from Italy to Egypt. It was disbanded on 15 December 1945. It was resurrected as a medium and light helicopter squadron in 1982 and operated from AFB Hoedspruit until its final disbandment on 4 December 1992. History Initial Coastal Bomber role 31 Squadron was formed in December 1939 by amalgamating 13 (B.R.) SquadronCoastal Bomber/Reconnaissance Squadron (re-designated as \\"A\\" Flight) and 14 (B.R.) Squadron (re-designated as \\"B\\" Flight) as a Coastal Squadron. The squadron flew Junkers Ju 86's and Blenheim Mk 1's. On 10 June 1940 the Blenheims attacked the Italian ship SS Timavo which was forced to run aground 5 miles north of St. Mary's Hill, north of Durban. The Junkers were replaced by Avro Ansons and on 1 September 1940 the Squadron again split with \\"A\\" Flight re-designated as 31 Coastal Reconnaissance Flight flying from Durban and \\"B\\" Flight as 33 Coastal Reconnaissance Flight flying from Port Elizabeth. On 1 July 1942, 31 Coastal Reconnaissance Flight was disbanded and renamed No. 22 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron. Heavy Bomber Squadron =Egypt, Crete and the Aegean= The Squadron was re-formed at Zwartkop Air Station in South Africa in early January 1944 and was moved to Almaza in Egypt on 30 January 1944. Ground crews started arriving from 19 February 1944 and air crews were sent to No. 1675 Conversion Unit at Lydda, Palestine to be converted onto the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber. On 19 April 1944 an advance party set off to establish a base camp forty kilometers north of Cairo, accordingly named Kilo 40. The first aircraft arrived at Kilo 40 on 27 April 1944 and the Squadron was joined by 34 Squadron at Kilo 40 ‚Äì both squadrons being placed under command of the newly established No. 2 Wing, SAAF. Operations began on 27 May 1944, flying bomber missions over Crete and the Aegean, with 31 Sqn's first target being the runway at Kastelli Pediada in eastern Crete. =Central Europe missions= B-24's over Ploiesti oil fields, Romania From 16 June 1944 the squadron started to move to the Celone airfield close to Foggia in southern Italy to join No. 205 Group RAF, RAF together with 178 and 614 RAF Squadrons. The area of operations was expanded to include strategic targets in the Balkans, Hungary, Austria, Romania and northern Italy. The squadron was also frequently tasked with air supply to partisans in Yugoslavia as well as for mine-laying missions on the Danube. =Supporting the Warsaw Uprising= In the summer of 1944 the squadron took part in the invasion of Southern France. It was also one of the squadrons (with 34 Squadron and 178 Sqn RAF) that took part in the long-range airlift of supplies to the Polish Home Army in Warsaw. Between 12‚Äì17 August these squadrons lost 17 of the ninety-three aircraft sent to Warsaw with eight of these losses being from 31 Squadron. On Sunday 13 August 1944, 10 crews of 31 Squadron were ordered to Brindisi and briefed for a 3,200 km flight plan from Foggia to Warsaw to drop supplies for the encircled Polish resistance. The supplies were packed in 12 canisters per aircraft, each weighing 150 kg containing light machine guns, ammunition, hand grenades, radio equipment, food and medical supplies. There were 196 11-hour night flights from Brindisi and Foggia in Italy (total between 31 and 34 Squadrons) to and from Warsaw from 4 August to early September 1944. Of the 80 aircraft involved, 31 were shot down, 17 during the weekend of 13‚Äì16 August. Sixty-nine South Africans were killed and twenty-five SAAF Liberators were shot down. Fifty percent of the aircraft were from the RAF, and 36% of the total force was South African. Air Marshal Sir John Slessors, the Allied air commander in the Mediterranean, later put the losses at one bomber lost for every ton of supplies dropped. =Transport role at the end of the war= After the end of the fighting the squadron converted to transport duties, operating a shuttle service from Italy in which liberated Allied prisoners of war were flown from Italy back to the United Kingdom and South African troops preparing to return home were flown to Egypt. In September 1945 the squadron moved to Shallufa in Egypt, from where it operated as a transport squadron within the Mediterranean until 5 December 1945. It was disbanded on 15 December 1945. Helicopter Role The squadron was reformed on 4 January 1982 at AFB Hoedspruit, operating Puma and Alouette III helicopters. Activities included crime-prevention operations in support of the South African Police, search and rescue, mercy flights, VIP transportation and firefighting. The squadron also played an active part in the Border War, with deployments to the operational region between 1982 and 1989, carrying out operations in both South West Africa and southern Angola. The Pumas were replaced by the Oryx on 12 February 1991, but due to ongoing cost cutting ‚Äì it was disbanded at Hoedspruit on 4 December 1992.

She was Countess of the Palatinate herself from 1195 until her death, as the wife of the Welf count palatine Henry V.  Life  Agnes' father Conrad of Hohenstaufen was a younger half-brother of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who had enfeoffed him with the Electoral Palatinate in 1156. A cautious and thoughtful politician, he aimed for peace and reconciliation in the Empire. Even before 1180, he had betrothed his daughter to Henry V, the eldest son of the rebellious Saxon duke Henry the Lion, in order to defuse the re-emerging conflict between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties. In 1193, however, Barbarossa's son and successor, Emperor Henry VI, wanted to create a political alliance with King Philip II of France and planned to marry his cousin Agnes to Philip II. When the young Welf scion Henry V heard of this plan, he contacted Agnes' parents. Her father avoided definitive statements on her betrothal, as he preferred a marriage with the French king, but also did not want to offend Henry V, whom Agnes revered fanatically. Agnes' mother Irmengard (d. 1197), daughter of Count Berthold I of Henneberg, continued to advocate her daughter's marriage with the Welf prince. A little later she took advantage of the absence of her husband, who stayed at Henry VI's court, to thwart the Emperor's plan. She invited the young Welf to Stahleck Castle, where he and Agnes were married in January or February 1194.Ruth Gerstner: Die Geschichte der lothringischen und rheinischen Pfalzgrafschaft von ihren Anf√§ngen bis zur Ausbildung des Kurterritoriums Pfalz = Rheinisches Archiv, vol. 40, Ludwig R√∂hrscheid, Bonn, 1941, p. 111 Online Furious Emperor Henry VI felt betrayed and demanded that Conrad immediately annul the marriage. Conrad, however, dropped his initial resistance to the marriage and, seeing as it had already been blessed in Church, chose to convince his nephew Henry VI of the domestic political benefits of this marriage. Conrad's sons had died young and Henry VI could assure the succession in the Electoral Palatinate by enfeoffing Henry the Welf. Additionally, Conrad and Agnes on the occasion of the marital union convinced the emperor to pardon Henry the Lion, who had been deposed and outlawed by Frederick Barbarossa in 1180. The reconciliation between Emperor Henry VI and Duke Henry the Lion was solemnly held in March 1194 at the Imperial Palace of Tilleda. Agnes and her husband Henry V had done their bit to prepare for this major domestic event with their unscheduled marriage at Stahleck Castle. Moreover, Emperor Henry VI had to settle the conflict with the House of Welf, to ensure peace in the Holy Roman Empire while enforcing his claims on the Kingdom of Sicily after the death of King Tancred on 20 February 1194.  Issue  Agnes and Henry had a son and two daughters: * Henry, was Count Palatine of the Rhine from 1212 to 1214 * Irmengard (1200‚Äì1260), married Herman V, Margrave of Baden-Baden * Agnes (1201‚Äì1267), married Duke Otto II of Bavaria. Agnes and Otto became the ancestors of the House of Wittelsbach in Bavaria and the Palatinate. Her daughter Elisabeth was the mother of Conradin. Her son Louis was the father of Emperor Louis IV.  Legacy  During the Romanticism period in the 19th century, the historic picture of Agnes of Hohenstaufen was blissfully idealized. In Christian Dietrich Grabbe's drama entitled Henry VI, published in 1830, she is depicted as a carefree but resolute girl, who even addresses the Imperial Diet to assert her marriage with the man she loves. Fighting for the love and happiness of her reluctant fianc√©, she brings about the ultimate reconciliation of the Welf and Hohenstaufen families on the deathbed of her father-in-law, Henry the Lion, who called her \\"a rose blossoming between to rocks\\". In fact, it was Agnes' mother Irmengard who had arranged the marriage. The opera Agnes von Hohenstaufen by the Italian composer Gaspare Spontini, based on the libretto by Ernst Raupach, had its premiere on 12 June 1829 at the Royal Opera Berlin.

He was respected by the Chinese community and often regarded as modern-age Robin Hood, as some say he shared the cash from the robberies with the poor. On the evening of 16 February 1976, he was captured by the police, and was executed on 11 June 1981 in Pudu Prison. Early life Botak Chin was born in Kuala Lumpur in 3 March 1951 to a family of 10 siblings. His father worked with Malayan Railways, and as a child he lived at the Malaysian Railway quarters adjacent to the Caltex station on Jalan Ipoh in Kuala Lumpur. He studied at a Chinese vernacular primary school and then went on to attend the Methodist Boys' Secondary School in Sentul until Form 3. After dropping out from school, Botak Chin worked as a fishmonger at the market at Jalan Tun Ismail (formerly known as Maxwell Road). After his mother's death, he often spent time away from home, with his friends who were the local hoodlums that eventually led him to commit petty crimes. He joined a gang named Gang 360 (Sak Pak Lok),http://berita-harian- online.com/botak-chin/ and he was impressed by the firearms possessed by the gang members. On 19 April 1969, Botak Chin and two of his friends took part in a robbery for the first time. At the age of 18, he proudly own his first firearm, a .22 calibre revolver. He then formed his own gang shortly thereafter and proceeded to engage in robbery sprees.The Star Online eCentral ‚Äì Movies ‚Äì Malaysia Entertainment Crime sprees Botak Chin engaged in eight robberies within a month in 1969. This led to his first arrest; he was convicted and sentenced to prison for 7 years. He was released before serving out his sentence and resolved to retire from gangsterism. However, his attempt to become clean and work as a grocer was unsatisfying financially; and he returned to crime. This reference doesn‚Äôt actually say he worked as a grocer so take it with a grain of salt. He formed a gang with Ng Cheng Wong (aka Ah Wong), Beh Kok Chin (aka Pangkor Chai) and Teh Bok Lay (aka Seh Chai) and bought some firearms in Thailand. On 2 June 1975, the gang robbed RM 5,800 from an illegal gambling den in Sentul. With the income from that robbery, Botak Chin \\"reinvested in his business\\" ‚Äì he returned to Thailand and bought another eight firearms along with 100 rounds of ammunition. The gang used a vacant tin mine in Kepong as their shooting range, using stray dogs for target practice. There were also reports that Botak Chin used to openly brandish his weapons at the Sentul market but nobody dared to inform the police as they were afraid of being victimised by Botak Chin or his gang. On 20 July 1975, now with even more so-called \\"tools of trade\\" (the new firearms), the gang became more ambitious and bellicose. They robbed a bank on Jalan Imbi and fled with RM95,000, and then gunned down several mahjong players inside a Chinese temple in Jalan Kolam Ayer and made off with an additional RM10,000. Using his share from the robberies, he bought a luxury car. Owing to the growing terror in Kuala Lumpur, the police stepped up their fight against Botak Chin. Deputy Superintendent S. Kulasingam (a much-feared high-ranking police officer at his time, nicknamed the 'Crime Buster of Kuala Lumpur') was assigned to stop Botak Chin.Crime buster Kulasingam dies His need for firearms and ammunition grew to conduct more robberies, as well as to conduct gun battles with the police and feuds with rival gangs. Moreover, his gang influence had to expand and his position as a gang leader had to be strengthened. Filled with desperation, he even targeted policemen. In one particular case, he attacked three policemen and confiscated their pistols. Botak Chin made frequent trips to Thailand not only to procure illegal firearms, but also to obtain protective talisman (called tangkal) from Siamese (locally called bomoh Siam or bomoh Thai) black magicians (shamans). It was rumoured that he managed to successfully evade capture, survive and escape from numerous gun battles with the police because the Phra Pidta talisman he obtained from a Siamese shaman yielded supernatural powers. During a shootout with the police in Segambut Dalam, Botak Chin's car was riddled with multiple bullets. Miraculously, however, he escaped unscathed. This led people to speculate that the talisman he was wearing made him invulnerable to bullets, knives and even poison. Some even believed that he could become invisible at will, gave him superhuman powers, thus escaping unseen. Botak Chin grew more fearless and even more determined to pursue his desire for more power in the underworld. Even when one of his right hand men, Chau Kuan (aka Ah Kuan) was shot dead at a sundry shop at Jalan Kovil Hilir on 25 September 1975, his gang operations were not crippled, nor was he demoralised. Botak Chin's gang biggest exploit occurred on 26 October 1975, when the gang fled with RM218,000 after gunning down a security guard who was delivering money to a turf club. With his share of approximately RM40,000 from the robbery, he made yet another trip to Thailand to purchase even more weapons: a total of 19 guns, 5 hand grenades and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Although things were getting better for Botak Chin and his men, his rivals became even more envious of his accomplishments, leading to an increase in confrontations between him, rival factions, and competing gangs. To consolidate his power as the supreme gangster in Kuala Lumpur, Botak Chin focused his attention towards gang wars. In one major war at a disused tin mine in Jinjang, one of his rivals, Tua Pui Lek, the head of the Five Finger Mountain gang who had sworn to sabotage Botak Chin and take over his position, failed to achieve his ultimate objective; the most that he managed was to murder Botak Chin's right-hand man, Ah Wong. The police gained some success where one of his trusted lieutenants, Seh Chai, killed himself when he was surrounded by the police on Jalan Alor. Early in 1976, Botak Chin recruited new members into his gang. After the recruitment, his gang conducted 3 robberies and escaped with RM400,000. In spite of the successes, the gang suffered heavy casualties. Seven of his men were shot dead and a few others were caught. The police confiscated 15 firearms, along with ammunition and hand grenades. Arrest and prosecution On 16 February 1976, the police captured Botak Chin at the Eng Leong sawmill. He miraculously survived despite being seriously wounded with six gunshot wounds. According to the news report by the New Straits Times, he was set up by two of his own henchmen, Pang Kok Chye and Ah Keong. Botak Chin told the High Court that on the 16th, he was at the Tiong Nam settlement between 7pm and 8pm when Pang Kok Chye and Ah Keong came to see him. They told him that two people required help and wanted to meet with him. Botak Chin then followed his men by car to the Jalan Ipoh sawmill to meet the two people. He went into the sawmill and sat on a chair for 15 minutes before asking Pang Kok Chye and Ah Keong regarding the whereabouts of the men they were supposed to meet. He then proceeded to make a telephone call. Afterwards, as he was replacing the receiver, a shootout started outside the mill. He then felt agony all over his body and became weak and giddy. He fell onto the floor before realising that he had been shot. Botak Chin claimed that during the shooting, Pang Kok Chye and Ah Keong ran to the back of the mill. Then, when the shooting stopped, something was thrown into building, filling the room with smoke. He had difficulty breathing and became unconscious. The next time he regained consciousness, he found himself hospitalised. Botak Chin denied being involved in the robberies he had conducted and claimed that other robbers used his name as an alias. However, a senior police officer testified in court that Botak Chin was conscious during his arrest. Botak Chin allegedly told the police officers who arrested him that if he was not injured in his arms he would have shot and killed many of them. Botak Chin apparently said, \\"Kalau saya punya due tangan tidak jem, saya sudah tembak. Lu nasib baik.\\" (If I could shoot, I would have done so. You were just lucky.) Upon Botak Chin's capture, rumours about his alleged invincibility began circulating. Superstitious individuals believed that the police was able to wound and apprehend Botak Chin because, on that day, he left home without wearing his talisman. Another belief is that the police went to Thailand to obtain the assistance of Botak Chin's shaman so as to defeat him. According to newspaper reports, at the time of capture, Botak Chin carried a green cloth with Siamese writings and a plastic green purse containing a note book. Moreover, he wore 3 talismans ‚Äì one around his neck and 2 more around his waist. Apparently Botak Chin protested when the police wanted to remove the talismans, saying \\"Ini saya punya tokong\\" (This is my temple). A plethora of valuable accessories including a Rolex watch, a gold chain with 2 pendants and a jade gold ring were found on him. His wallet contained RM231, HK$10, 50 pieces of Japanese \\"banana\\" notes, some Thai Bahts, and a photograph of two women. On 12 May 1980, Chin, who was 27 years old at that time, faced 3 charges under the Internal Security Act at the Kuala Lumpur High Court. The News Straits Times reported that he denied possessing firearms or ammunition, as well as ownership of two pouches of bullets which were found in his pockets during the sawmill incident. He claimed that he did not know how they got into his pockets. However, he pleaded guilty to the ISA charges and became the first Malaysian to do so. He was sentenced to death by the High Court in the same year. On 1 January 1981, while on death row, he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape from his cell in Pudu Prison; he stabbed several prison wardens but was seriously injured during the struggle. Botak Chin was finally executed at 3 a.m. on 11 June 1981, in the same prison. Ironically, none of the charges were murder; he was sentenced to death solely for the possession of firearms, a capital offence. Before Chin's execution, his lawyer appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for a retrial. The appeal was accepted, but Chin was still found guilty. He appealed to the Supreme Court of Malaysia and Pardons Board, both of which were constituted under the Federal Constitution, but both organisations rejected the appeals. Personal life Dr. Mahadevan, the former director of Tanjung Rambutan Mental Hospital in Perak, treated Botak Chin for 19 days to determine if he was adequately sane to stand trial. He found Botak Chin to be highly intelligent ‚Äì but a \\"misguided genius\\". At the mental hospital Botak Chin told Dr. Mahadevan that since he was a young boy he had always wanted to help the poor and down-trodden. He wanted to protect them from corrupt officials and gangsters who extorted money from the poor and weak. Botak Chin revealed that he was once brutally attacked by gangsters who entered his vegetable stall at the market and tried to extort money from him, failing which, they beat him until his collar bone was fractured. This incident changed his life. Botak Chin then started to learn martial arts and joined a gang for protection. He also encouraged people to join his secret society so that they would not be harmed and exploited. Members of his secret society had to swear not to take advantage of the poor, cut their hair short and not take drugs. He further told Dr. Mahadevan that in his hometown people regarded him as Robin Hood because he robbed from the rich and gave a considerable amount of the spoils to the poor. Apparently, part of the loot went to his gang and part of it went to the family of those members who were killed or caught by the police. This possibly explains why he managed, time and time again, to hide and gain refuge in the squatter settlements when pursued by the police ‚Äì with the goodwill he had with the poor, the community were helping him escape. He was their hero. Botak Chin was no ordinary gangster. His secret society was guided by his philosophy and governed by strict principles and guidelines. Everyone, including himself, had to comply. To enforce discipline among his troops and keep order in the gang, he had executed henchmen who had breached the rules. He was not a killer, he was their taiko (Cantonese saying, meaning 'big brother') and he was just doing his job, he told Dr. Mahadevan. Having built a reputation of reverence among society as Robin Hood, people, especially the lower classes, treated him as such. During his stay at the hospital, patients offered to wash his clothes and perform chores for him. Although Botak Chin never married, he had plenty of female admirers. Dr Mahadevan said he would get calls from women inquiring about Botak Chin when he was at the hospital. Dr Mahadevan said that Botak Chin was rushed back to Kuala Lumpur when a bullet was found in his high security hospital cell because it appeared that his men were coming to help him escape. During his final days, he sought solace in various religions. While it was his dying wish was to donate his organs for medical purposes, this request was rejected as he had not signed a written consent.

In a brief racing career in the spring and summer of 1820 he won both of his races including The Derby. He collapsed and died on the Newmarket gallops shortly after his Derby win. Background Sailor was a tall, leggy chestnut horse sired by Scud out of the mare Goosander. Goosander was a highly successful broodmare who also produced The Oaks winner Shoveler and was a sister to the dam of the Derby winner Sam. Sailor was trained by William Chifney and ridden in the Derby by Chifney‚Äôs younger brother, Sam Chifney, Jr. Chifney was one of the outstanding jockeys of his era, and one of the first to hold horses up in the early stages of a race before finishing strongly: he became famous for this tactic which became known as the \\"Chifney Rush\\". Racing career Sailor was one of the leading fancies for the 1820 Derby before he appeared on a racecourse: in November 1819 he was being offered at odds of 15/1 for the race by British bookmakers. Sailor won a sweepstakes at Newmarket on his debut in spring 1820. The Derby was run in extremely difficult conditions at Epsom on Sailor's birthday on 18 May. A violent storm on the eve of the race demolished many of the tents and booths which had been set up on the downs and left the ground very soft, which suited Sailor. He started the second favourite at odds of 4/1 in a field of fifteen runners. In a fast-run race, Sailor won the Derby easily by two lengths from Abjer, with the favourite Pindarrie finishing fifth. In the autumn of 1820, Sailor was being exercised on Newmarket Heath when he stumbled, staggered for two hundred yards and collapsed. He died on the spot from what was subsequently determined to be a burst blood vessel in his chest. Pedigree Sailor's pedigree contained significant inbreeding. He was inbred 3 √ó 3 to King Fergus, meaning that the stallion appeared twice in the third generation of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 √ó 4 √ó 4 to Eclipse, 3 √ó 4 to Highflyer, and 4 √ó 4 to Herod.

It depicts the life of Christopher Columbus at the Spanish court, his voyages across the Atlantic Ocean in which he discovered the Americas and his relationship with the mother of his second son Beatriz Enr√≠quez de Arana, whom he never married. Sabatini had originally been commissioned to write a screenplay for a planned film of Columbus around 1939. The project was continually delayed, and in 1941 Sabatini published his story as a novel instead.Spicer p.126-127 The story is in the style of his previous works Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, which had already been adapted into hit films, and portrayed Columbus as a swashbuckler. Film adaptation In the late 1940s the projected Columbus film was revived with strong support from the Rank Organisation who intended it as a prestige project targeted at the global market. It was produced by Sydney Box and made in Technicolor with the American actor Fredric March cast as Columbus. Box was unhappy with Sabatini's script, which he considered historically inaccurate and overly romantic.Murphy p.130-131 Box and his wife Muriel Box extensively rewrote the screenplay aiming at greater realism at the expense of Sabatini's swashbuckling style. On its release the film was poorly received by critics, and had limited success at the box office. References Further reading * Murphy, Robert.

Shortly after passing over Adlergestell (an arterial road), which begins here, the line connects to the former Berlin-Sch√∂neweide repair shop of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (, RAW Sch√∂neweide), now the main workshop of the Berlin S-Bahn. The line descends to ground level and passes over a level crossing over Oberspreestra√üe (street) to reach Oberspree station. Shortly after the station it curves slightly to the right and runs for half a kilometre straight ahead. After a further right turn it runs under the Berlin outer ring to its terminus at Spindlersfeld station. History  Location of the factory and Spindlersfeld station (top right) in 1896 The mostly single-track line along with its two stations was released for passenger operations on 1 April 1892. From 15 November 1891, the line had been used for freight to and from the factory of W. Spindler (a dye works and laundry), after which the entire surrounding area is named. In addition to the delivery of products, the line was used for supplies to the factory, especially coal. It also carried workers, similar to the Siemens Railway, which was built in the late 1920s in north-western Berlin. The railway was designed by two brothers, William and Carl Spindler, the sons of the founder. In 1906, the line to Gorlitz railway was raised on an embankment, with the junction to the branch line rebuilt as a flying junction. The branch line was also raised until shortly west of Oberspreestra√üe and the line has grade-separated crossings of the other streets (Adlergestell and Hartriegelstra√üe). On 15 October 1927, another branch from the route was completed, which leads to the then newly constructed RAW Sch√∂neweide. The depot has been used since the 1950s as the main workshop for the S-Bahn, the U-Bahn and the tram network. Electrical test operations 1903‚Äì1906  UEG electric test vehicle for the runs between Sch√∂neweide and Spindlersfeld From 15 August 1903, overhead electrification with AC power (6 kV, 25 Hz) was tested on the line by the company Union-Elektricit√§ts- Gesellschaft (UEG), which merged the following year with AEG. During these tests numerous approaches were tried to determine the best way of applying electrical equipment to railways. The trials ended on 1 March 1906. Parallel with the trials on the Spindlersfeld line, tests were carried out by AEG and Siemens & Halske, under a joint venture called Studiengesellschaft f√ºr Elektrische Schnellbahnen, with AC on the Royal Prussian Military Railway (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Milit√§r-Eisenbahn) between Marienfelde and Zossen. Although brief, the tests carried out between Niedersch√∂neweide-Johannisthal and Spindlersfeld were an important milestone in the development of the DC power system at relatively low voltage, which was now preferred to high voltage single-phase AC. An immediate practical application of the AC test system in 1907 was on the Altona‚ÄìBlankenese line of the Hamburg-Altona City and Suburban Railway (Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn), later to develop into the Hamburg S-Bahn. Becoming part of the Berlin S-Bahn network  On 1 February 1929, the line was part of the second phase of the introduction of electrical operations. This time it was electrified using a third rail mounted on the side of the track, with the conductor on the underside of the conductor rail and using 750 V dc, which is still the electrical system used by the Berlin S-Bahn. The trains were operated on working days as traction group F (called Friedrich), running via the northern Ringbahn and the Berlin Stadtbahn to Friedrichshagen. The Germania plan of the Nazis did not provide for an extension of the stub line past Sch√∂neweide. An underground extension of the branch from Spindlersfeld to a station in K√∂penick was, however, mentioned, but the proposal never progressed beyond the planning stage. The former branch line to Spindler factory is now a foot and cycle path In the Second World War the line was only slightly damaged, and it took only three months to put it back into operation even in 1945. In December of that year, the first casualty to occur on the S-Bahn since the war was recorded on the line. On the single-track bridge over the Adlergestell, a local freight train and an S-Bahn train collided head on and there were four dead and several seriously injured. The dispatcher, who was responsible for the section and had caused the accident by human error, was sentenced to death by the Soviet occupation forces. His subsequent life after the verdict, however, remains unclear. Post-war period  From 1952 trains continued past Sch√∂neweide again: they operated as traction group N (called Nordpol, that is North Pole) via the northern Ringbahn to Spandau West. In 1956/1957 the overbridge was built over the Adlergestell in order for the line could be duplicated. The new infrastructure was built of steel; the track itself was duplicated as far as the branch to RAW Sch√∂neweide. Trains to and from the railway repair shop or to Spindlersfeld would no longer block each other and conflicts such as that which led to the accident of 15 December 1945 would be avoided. After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the service to and from Spindlersfeld was changed again. The traction group was originally cut back to run to Sch√∂nhauser Allee and after the completion of a separate pair of tracks on the curve to Pankow the service was extended to Blankenburg. The \\"Mini-Otto\\"  From 31 January 1976, the so-called Mini-Otto sets operated on the line. The \\"mini\\" referred to the length of the train set, a two-carriage set (Viertelzug, literally ‚Äúquarter train‚Äù) and Otto was the radio call sign for traction group O. The train group name was changed because the operations of the old traction group N (Nordpol) was now confined to the section of its former route that was in West Berlin. To avoid confusion, Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) designated the operations on the East Berlin section of the route as traction group O. Normally, the Berlin S-Bahn operated Halbz√ºge (‚Äúhalf trains‚Äù, four-carriage sets, for example, ET+EB+EB+ET) and, by the end of the war, DRG had rebuilt all former driving carriages (ES) into trailer carriages (EB). The materials from the former cabs were used to build other motor carriages (ET). After 1945, however, some units were restored as two-carriage sets of motor and driving carriages (ET + ES). In addition, in 1952, the S-Bahn took over two-carriage sets (ET + ES) from the railway workshop of the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center. These were called Peenem√ºnder Viertel (Peenem√ºnde quarter sets) in Berlin. Crucial for use with two-carriage sets was the increasing population in the northern district of Berlin, Buch. To accommodate the growing population, DRG restored the second track to Karow station, which had been removed un 1945 as war reparations to the Soviet Union, in order to allow trains to run at 10-minute intervals. A new traction group L (called Ludwig) was established to run between Buch and Alexanderplatz. Traction group Otto was cut back to operate on weekdays between Blankenburg and Spindlersfeld. On the weekend, Ludwig services, however, ran between Buch and Sch√∂neweide, while Otto services shuttled between Sch√∂neweide and Spindlersfeld. Until the extension of the 10-minute cycle over the weekend, trains ran through from Buch to Spindlersfeld, under the traction group name of Sch√∂neweide. The introduction of the new timetable, however, revealed unfavourable arrival and departure times towards Spindlersfeld. The operations were therefore separated again, and the branch line was served by its own shuttles. Since the traffic on the route is fairly sparse, the use of two-carriage sets was ideal. Thus the mini-Otto services came to be operated by two Peenem√ºnde quarter sets. At times of high patronage or if one of the two trains failed, four-carriage sets from Gr√ºnau depot were used. Mini-Otto services ended after ten years on 31 May 1986. After the reunification of Berlin  Oberspree station: there used to be a second track along the left edge of the platform Until the mid-1990s, freight trains operated to Spindlersfeld, after which both equipment for handling freight and the siding to Sch√∂neweide were removed. The siding on the former W. Spindler laundry was converted into a bike path. The S-Bahn bridge over Hartriegelstra√üe is the last bridge supported by Hartung's columns (cast iron columns that were designed by Hugo Hartung (1855‚Äì1932) and installed widely in the S-Bahn between 1880 and 1910) that continues (as of October 2010) to be used by S-Bahn trains. In 1992, the bridge and the pillars were given a new coat of paint. The cast-iron stabilisers were secured against heavy collisions with road traffic. Unfortunately, the horizontal facings of the capitals of these columns were no longer available. Currently, S-Bahn line S 47 operates from Hermannstra√üe. According to plans of the Senate of Berlin the line will be duplicated, in order to allow the service to operate at 10-minute intervals. The date for the duplication has been postponed several times, however, so that work is not expected to start before 2015. Stations  Oberspree  Oberspree station is located approximately halfway along the line where it crosses the Oberspreestra√üe. It was opened for passenger traffic on 1 April 1892. The station was initially built next to a railway crossing with a central platform. The station building was located on Bruno-B√ºrgel-Weg parallel with the line. In 1970, the building was demolished. DRG closed the crossing loop in 1973 without publicising this fact and changed the status of a station at a halt (Haltepunkt in German, meaning a station without a set of points) after the crossing loop had not been used for several years. It was last used at the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1973. Thus the impossibility of trains crossing each other meant that the 10-minute cycle of train services had to be abandoned. Crossing with delayed S-Bahn trains and with freight trains were made either in Sch√∂neweide on the bridge over the Adlergestell or in Spindlersfeld, where track 9, which was intended primarily for freight traffic running to the sidings, was also equipped with conductor rail. The crossing loop in Oberspree existed until September 1984, but the access points to it had been removed previously. In 1976, a road was built over it. The most recent activity at the station was the building of new steel pedestrian bridge, which was completed in December 1997. Spindlersfeld  Spindlersfeld station with a line S47 train The terminus at Spindlersfeld is located at the corner of Oberspreestra√üe and Ernst-Grube-Stra√üe. In addition to the platform for the S-Bahn, there were on one side a loading ramp at the freight shed and a loading road. On the other side, there was a loading facility for VEB M√ºllabfuhr (the state waste-disposal company). The city of Berlin later closed the garbage loading siding. There were sidings for VEB Rewatex (a new name for the nationalised W. Spindler Company) and from the late 1980s for VEB Dampfkesselbau, later called VEB Beh√§lterbau. In 1983, DRG ripped up the southern of the two loading ramps and replaced it with four new freight tracks. In 1988, as part of rationalisation measures, interlocking ‚ÄúSpf‚Äù was closed and its supervision was taken over by the signal room at the station as part of an electro-mechanical system. The old semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals. This was followed after Die Wende (the changes accompanying German reunification) by the removal of the freight facilities and the Rewatex siding. Today, apart from some fragments of the tracks in the ground, few signs of the past importance of the freight infrastructure remain. In 2006, the platform was moved to Oberspreestra√üe, shortening the route for passengers transferring between the S-Bahn and trams to K√∂penick or Adlershof. The old entrance to Ernst-Grube-Strasse has been maintained. A two-track development of the station, however, is not in sight; even if the proposed duplication of the whole line goes ahead, the terminus will still have only one track.

The goal of the V2 ratio is to improve on existing and popular measures of risk-adjusted return, such as the Sharpe ratio, information ratio or Sterling ratio by taking into account the psychological impact of investment performances. The V2 ratio over-penalizes investments for which the investors had to go through bad returns comparatively to the market. The V2R is calculated as: V^2_R = \\\\frac{\\\\big(\\\\frac{V_n}{V_0}\\\\big)^\\\\frac{P}{n} - 1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}{\\\\big(\\\\frac{V_i}{V_i^p}-1\\\\big)^2}}{n}}+1} where V_i is the ratio between the investment and the benchmark values at time i (and V_0,V_n the initial and final values respectively), V_i^p the peak value ratio reached at time i, n the number of periods and P the number of identical periods in a year.  History  The V2 ratio was created by Emmanuel Marot of quantitative trading company Zenvestment (previously 'Valu Valu', hence the 'V2' in the V2 Ratio) and first published in 2011 on SeekingAlpha.com.  Rationale  Anchoring is a cognitive bias that shifts perception toward a reference point (the anchor). When evaluating an investment performance, people tend to continuously compare their returns with the stock market at large, or, more precisely, with the index commonly quoted by medias, such as the S&P; 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To address this, the V2 ratio divides the excess return of an investment by the quadratic mean of the relative drawdowns. The relative drawdown compares the loss in value of the investment since its previous peak with the loss in value in the benchmark. For instance, if an asset is down 30% since its peak while the market at large is down by 25%, then the relative drawdown is only 5%. The perception of the poor performance of the asset is somehow mitigated by the overall loss of the market. Taking the ulcer index as a direct inspiration, the V2 ratio uses a quadratic mean of the relative drawdowns to over-penalize large swerves, as investors are more likely to liquidate the asset or abandon the strategy when facing such large relative losses.

The castle is the ancestral seat of the family of Waldburg- Wolfegg, which still owns it today. Building Schloss Wolfegg courtyard (2005) The main building of the castle consists of four wings arranged in the shape of a rectangle with towers in the corners. Its exterior design and layout dates back to Truchsess Jakob II. of Waldburg (1546‚Äì1589) and his wife Johanna (1548‚Äì1613). After a fire in 1578 destroyed an older building, they built a new castle. Parts of it however were destroyed in 1646, when Swedish troops under Carl Gustaf Wrangel ransacked the place near the end of the Thirty Years' War and laid fire to it. Since the owner Maximilian Willibald of Waldburg-Wolfegg was short of funds, the restoration of the castle was delayed until 1651. From 1691 to 1700 the sculptor and plasterer Balthasar Kimmer of Wangen (1653‚Äì1702) redesigned the interior of the rooms with official and representative functions. In the 18th century some of the guest rooms were decorated in Rococo style. Towards the end of the 19th century the castle was extensively renovated again. The dining rooms received a new interior design and the castle's chapel was remodeled in a Neo-Gothic fashion. Use Nowadays international concerts of classical music take place twice a year in the splendid Knights' Hall (2005). The castle, which is still occupied by members of the Waldburg-Wolfegg family, is usually not accessible to the public. However once or twice a year public concerts are performed within the castle during which concert visitors can see some of the castle's inner room, in particular the Rittersaal (knights' hall). The Rittersaal is a large hall decorated in Baroque style featuring 24 life-sized wood sculptures and large ceiling mirrors. It is considered to be one of the most original room designs of the Baroque period in Germany. In addition to those rooms being used for concerts guided tours through other parts of the castle might be offered at that occasion. In May 2016 the Denkmalstiftung Baden-W√ºrttemberg, a foundation for the preservation of historical monuments in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, designated the Rittersaal as the historic monument of the month. The castle also hosts the Wolfegger Kabinett, a large collection of graphic art from the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance periods. Discovery of the map that named America Detail of the printed wall map of the world with the name America first mentioned. In April 1507 an edition of 1,000 copies of the wall map of the world by the German cartographers Martin Waldseem√ºller and Matthias Ringmann was printed, on which the continent and the name America appeared for the first time. On account of the rapid development of cartography in this epoch these were fast superseded by more detailed editions, so that this edition quickly fell out of use and all issues were lost over time. Their fate and whereabouts were unknown until one of the originals was rediscovered in 1901 by the historian and cartographer Joseph Fischer in the library of the castle, the Wolfegger Kabinett. The exemplar was wide and high and in very good condition. It was originally the property of Johannes Sch√∂ner, an astronomer, geographer, and cartographer in the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg. Later the family of Waldburg-Wolfegg acquired the map and it remained in their archives for more than 250 years. In 2001 the United States Library of Congress bought the map from Waldburg-Wolfegg family for ten million dollars.

The rift is being caused by the separation of the Somali plate from the Nubian plate, driven by a thermal plume. Although the term is sometimes used in the narrow sense of the Kenyan Rift, the larger definition of the Gregory Rift is the set of faults and grabens extending southward from the Gulf of Aden through Ethiopia and Kenya into Northern Tanzania, passing over the local uplifts of the Ethiopian and Kenyan domes. Ancient fossils of early hominins, the ancestors of humans, have been found in the southern part of the Gregory Rift.  Etymology  The Gregory Rift is named in honour of the British geologist John Walter Gregory who explored the geology of the rift in 1892‚Äì93 and 1919.http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/6/1/1.full.pdf Location Ol Doinyo Lengai erupting in 1966 The Gregory Rift lies within the Mozambique belt, often considered to be the remains of an orogenic system similar to the Himalayas. This belt runs from Ethiopia through Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. The rift is widest at the northern end in the Afar region, narrowing to a few kilometers in northern Tanzania, then splaying out in the North Tanzania Divergence. The Gregory Rift has shoulders rising over above sea level, above the inner part of the graben. The Tanzanian portion includes Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, and the huge caldera of Ngorongoro. This portion also contains Ol Doinyo Lengai, the world's only active carbonatite volcano. Lakes in the rift other than Lake Turkana are mostly small and shallow, some with fresh water but many being saline. The thickness of lake sediments is mostly unknown. In Lake Turkana they seem to be at most thick, in the Baringo ‚Äì Bogoria half-graben from to thick and in the Afar depression up to thick. Exploration Joseph Thomson, first geologist to examine the region The first well-known European geologist to explore the region was Joseph Thomson, a member of an expedition in 1879-1880 sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society of Britain. From his observations he deduced the existence of a great fault. Thomson returned in 1883, traveling through the rift valley in Kenya from Mount Longonot to Lake Baringo. Describing the valley around this lake he said: \\"Imagine if you can a trough or depression 3300 feet above sea level, and twenty miles broad, the mountains rising with very great abruptness on both sides to a height of 9000 feet\\". John Walter Gregory visited central Kenya in 1893 and again in 1919. His 1896 book The Great Rift Valley is considered a classic. Gregory was the first well-known European to use the term \\"rift valley\\", which he defined as \\"a linear valley with parallel and almost vertical sides, which has fallen owing to a series of parallel faults\\". In 1913 the German geologist Hans Reck made the first European study of the strata in the Olduvai Gorge to the west of the Crater Highlands. He brought a large collection of mammalian fossils back to Berlin. In 1928 Louis Leakey, the anthropologist, visited Berlin, where he saw that some of Reck's materials were artifacts. Leakey began exploring Olduvai in the 1930s and collecting material that has led to the site being recognized as an important center of early hominin occupation. Development Volcanism and rifting started in Kenya in the northern region of Turkana between 40 and 35 million years ago and then spread north and south. To the south volcanism and rifting happened together, first in other parts of northern Kenya around 30 million years ago, then around 15 million years ago in the central part of the Kenyan Rift, 12 million years ago in southern Kenya and 8 million years ago in northern Tanzania. When rifting reached the Tanzanian Craton, the rift split into the eastern Gregory Rift and the western Albertine Rift, which are separated by the wide East African Plateau. Large shield volcanoes near the margins of the craton and in the adjacent Mozambique belt issued large volumes of basaltic to trachytic magmatism between five and one million years ago, with faulting around 1.2 million years ago. Western cliffs of the Eastern Rift Valley near Iten with step faulting Volcanic activity started in the central Ethiopian plateau around 30 million years ago, long before rifting began. The first period of activity deposited flood basalts and rhyolites from to thick. Uplift of the Ethiopian plateau began around this time or soon after. Between 30 million and 10 million years ago synrift shield volcanoes deposited from to of additional material over the Ethiopian flood basalts. Rifting in Ethiopia began about 18 million years ago in the southwest and 11 million years ago in northern parts of the Main Ethiopian Rift as the opening of the Gregory rift caused the Afar Triple Junction to form. Volcanism from the Middle Pleistocene onward formed a chain of volcanoes along the floor of the rift throughout its length, dividing it into separate valleys. There are some indications that the lithosphere may have thinned below the Gregory rift, although based on basalt geochemistry the lithosphere is at least thick below the south of Kenya. The Gregory rift is oriented NS, and in the past the minimum horizontal tectonic stress direction was EW, the direction of extension. The alignment of rows of small vents, cones, domes and collapse pits in the Suswa, Silali and Kinangop Plateau regions support this theory. However, data from oil and gas exploration wells in Kenya, vents in volcanic shields to the east of the rift at Huri Hills, Mount Marsabit and Nyambeni Hills and recent small cones at Suswa and east of the Silali caldera all indicate that the minimum horizontal stress direction has changed to NW-SE within the last half million years.

Real Digital had planned to launch in Ireland. The service ceased transmitting on 31 March 2012 to \\"undergo essential maintenance work\\", and promised to return in approximately seven days. On 26 April 2013, David Henry informed The Guardian that the service intended to launch in the autumn., the service had not launched. The company was dissolved in September 2018. Real Digital's main competitors were Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media. Channels Real Digital only offered free-to-air channels which have been available on other platforms for several years. They had intended to offer pay television packages by spring 2012 which would have included Sky Sports 1 and 2 and a high definition version of Blackbelt TV. It was also planned that subscription packages were to be available on a month-by-month basis, without a contract or minimum subscription period. Additionally, it was proposed that pay-per-view services would be made available. Support for the BBC iPlayer and ITV Player video on demand services had also been announced. Technical information The service made use of the same fleet of satellites as Freesat and Sky, Astra 28.2¬∞E and Eutelsat 28A. This meant that any satellite dish which was positioned to receive these services was capable of receiving Real Digital, with either an additional suitable receiver or by simply swapping an old Freesat/Sky set top box with a REAL Digital STB. Providing the LNB (low- noise block downconverter) has sufficient outputs, the one dish was able to receive multiple services. For their proposed pay TV offering, Real Digital intended to use a Conax conditional access system. Real Digital offered two kinds of set-top boxes, one with a single tuner and the other with a dual tuner PVR, which were manufactured by Fortec Star and Digital Stream. Criticisms Launch Before launch, the company had missed many promised launch dates. The service eventually began broadcasting on 1 October 2011. Test boxes were received by reviewers and a small number of beta-testers in December 2011. production boxes still have not reached any high street retail stores, despite an agreement being announced with Maplin Electronics, although they had been carried by select specialist online retailers. While a number of set top boxes had been delivered to both testers and reviewers the first manufacturer Fortec Star was both late at delivering and incomplete software led to Maplin Electronics cancelling orders with Fortec Star. A number of live demonstrations to retailers showed the Real Digital EPG and TV channel lists running and the GUI was widely praised. Suspension of service On 31 March 2012 at midnight, the lease of the transponder on Eutelsat's Eutelsat 28A satellite ran out. The transponder was subsequently cleared, removing the EPG broadcast stream. Real Digital claim to be undergoing essential maintenance work, with the signal going offline for approximately 7 days. The move left the Real Digital beta-testers with nothing more than the DVB-S standard now and next programme information. , the stream has not returned and on 11 April 2012 Real Digital claimed on Facebook that work had halted due to the Easter break. Another Facebook post on 2 May 2012, denied that the service had closed but no further updates would be provided until there was definite news. On 29 May 2012, Real Digital deleted their Facebook page and removed all links to it from their website. On 5 December 2012 Real Digital submitted a communication to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in which Real Digital stated that it hoped to have a \\"soft launch\\" of a pay TV service in the first quarter of 2013, however this failed to occur. On 26 April 2013, David Henry informed The Guardian that the service intends to launch in the autumn, but this did not happen. Management The company was founded by former Rapture TV boss David Henry and Information TV boss Fred Perkins. On 11 November 2011, David Henry was disqualified from acting as a company director after failing to ensure that one of his former companies paid the appropriate amount of tax. Until he resigned from the company in February 2012, Henry had been the company's managing director. Between 2014 and 2016, General Satellite (a Russian manufacturer of set-top boxes) held a majority of the voting shares in Real Digital TV Limited.

Survey Discovered in 1906 by the German naturalist Richard Krone, who visited both caves called at that time Areias do Pedroso I and Areias do Pedroso II, the cave is very important in the field of biology because of the existence of the world-famous Pimelodella kronei, the Blind-Catfish, a troglobitic fish species unique to the waters of some caves in the region. This species of fish was later found in some creeks in the region of Bombas, and invariably shaped the idea of a subterrain river connecting both caves with Ressurgencia das Areias das Aguas Quentes.

Originating from a monsoon trough on July 21, Judy began as a tropical depression west of the Northern Mariana Islands. Tracking west-northwest, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Judy on July 23\\\\. By this time, the storm had turned due north. Two days later, Judy attained typhoon status as it began a gradual turn to the west-northwest. Late on July 25, the storm peaked with winds of 165 km/h (110 mph). Striking Kyushu on July 27, interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused Judy to quickly weaken as it neared South Korea. The weakened storm struck the country west of Pusan the following day before losing its identity near the border with North Korea. The remnants of Judy were last noted over the Sea of Japan. In Japan, damaging winds from the typhoon left approximately 4 million people without power. Significant flooding in the country resulted in 11 deaths and $28.9 million in damage. In South Korea, heavy rains from the storm exacerbated ongoing floods, leading to at least 20 fatalities. Flooding from the remnants of Judy affected the Soviet Far East, temporarily severing the Trans-Siberian Railway and killing 15 people. Meteorological history In mid-July, a monsoon trough located west of the Northern Mariana Islands produced two tropical disturbances. The first of these tracked due west and later became Tropical Storm Irving. The second of these disturbances remained poorly organized and development into a tropical cyclone was expected to be slow. By July 21, an area of low pressure formed within the system and convection associated with it increased. Situated underneath an anticyclone, upper-level outflow also improved. Following further organization of the system, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 11W on July 21; at this time, the depression was located about 555 km (345 mi) west of Guam. Further aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northwest, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July 23 and was assigned the name Judy by the JTWC. On July 23, a subtropical ridge to the northeast of Judy caused the system to turn northward. This turn was not well anticipated by tropical cyclone forecast models. By July 25, satellite imagery indicated that Judy had intensified into a typhoon. Within hours of reaching this strength, the a weather buoy near the storm recorded a barometric pressure of 974 mb (hPa; 28.76 inHg) and winds of . Strengthening continued throughout the day and Judy soon attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 175 km/h (110 mph). Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency assessed the typhoon to have attained ten-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) and a pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). On July 26, the typhoon turned towards the northwest and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck the southern coast of Kyushu before moving over the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after moving over Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205 km (125 mi) west of Pusan. Once onshore, rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12 hours. The remnants of Judy were last noted on July 29 over the Sea of Japan. Impact Typhoon Judy approaching Japan on July 27 On July 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency began warning residents of the typhoon's imminent arrival, stating that Judy would approach western parts of the country in two days. (accessed through LexisNexis) The following day, heavy rain and strong wind warnings were issued for much of Kyushu. (accessed through LexisNexis) Heavy rains from the storm affected much of southern Japan. Across Kyushu, rainfall rates exceeded per hour at times and many areas measured total rainfall over . Significant flooding and landslides from the storm destroyed 25 homes and damaged many more. In Nichinan, Miyazaki, roughly 1,800 people evacuated as a river rose and threatened to flood parts of the city. Damaging winds from the storm, measured up to in Kagoshima, left roughly 4 million households without power. (accessed through LexisNexis) Train service throughout Kyushu was significantly disrupted, with 110,000 passengers stranded. (accessed through LexisNexis) Damage throughout the island was placed at $3.8 million. Agricultural losses from the storm reached 3.5 billion yen ($25.1 million). In all, Typhoon Judy killed 11 people in Japan, destroyed 76 homes and damaged 10,664 others. On July 28, typhoon and heavy rain warnings were issued for all of South Korea. (accessed through LexisNexis) Numerous people in low-lying areas were evacuated. Thousands of vessels were also called to port to ride out the storm. (accessed through LexisNexis) Winds up to 125 km/h (78 mph) battered coastal areas of South Korea, uprooting many trees and leaving thousands without power. (accessed through LexisNexis) In Yeosu, hundreds of windows were blown out by the winds. Heavy rains, amounting to at least 335 mm (13.2 in) along the Yeongsan River, from the storm exacerbated ongoing floods in the country. (accessed through LexisNexis) In Pusan, 15 people were killed by the storm, 9 by landslides and 6 by structural collapse or flooding. (accessed through LexisNexis) Approximately 2,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in the city. In some areas, flood waters were \\"knee- deep.\\" Throughout the country, 20 people were confirmed to have been killed by the storm; however, media reports indicated that 24 people perished. (accessed through LexisNexis) According to Korean officials, roughly 47,000 people were left homeless and losses reached 1.2 billion won ($1.8 million USD). In the wake of Typhoon Judy, the South Korean Red Cross set up soup kitchens. The remnants of Judy produced heavy rains in the Soviet Far East in early August, resulting in significant flooding. In Primorsky Krai, at least 15 people were killed by the floods which virtually cut off part of the Trans-Siberian Railway and washed out 267 bridges. A total of 109 settlements were also inundated. (accessed through LexisNexis) Approximately 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of land was underwater at the height of the floods. In addition to the loss of human life, 75,000 cattle drowned.

The primary antenna is visible just to the left of the disk-shaped reflector, on the end of the mast. A \\"pair\\" of the \\"subsets\\" for a Lichtenstein B/C or C-1 \\"mattress\\" UHF radar antenna system. The FuG 240 \\"Berlin\\" was an airborne interception radar system operating at the \\"lowest end\\" of the SHF radio band (at about 3.3 GHz/9.1 cm wavelength), which the German Luftwaffe introduced at the very end of World War II. It was the first German radar to be based on the cavity magnetron, which eliminated the need for the large multiple dipole-based antenna arrays seen on earlier radars, thereby greatly increasing the performance of the night fighters. Introduced by Telefunken in April 1945, only about 25 units saw service. Background The German Luftwaffe first introduced an airborne interception radar in 1942, the FuG 202 \\"Lichtenstein B/C\\" and its direct follow-on version, the FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1. Both units operated at 490MHz, in the low UHF band with a wavelength of 0.61 meter. Radar antennas are sized roughly to the operational wavelength, or a fraction thereof, so the FuG 202 and 212 initially required large, 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) antenna arrays that projected in front of the aircraft and caused considerable drag - this was later reduced to a one-quarter subset of the same antenna design, centrally mounted on the aircraft's nose. By 1943 a series of efforts and lucky intercepts had allowed the Royal Air Force to introduce jammers, which interfered with the AI radar's operation. The RAF also introduced the Serrate radar detector, which allowed British night fighters to home in on the Lichtenstein radars. Over the summer and fall of 1943, the RAF downed an impressive number of German night fighters. The Luftwaffe responded by introducing the FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 in late 1943. To avoid RAF jamming, the SN-2 operated in the low-VHF range, at 90MHz, or 3.33 meter wavelength. The SN-2's lower frequency range required enormous eight-dipole Hirschgeweih (stag's antlers) antennas, which created so much drag that aircraft were slowed by some 50 km/hour. The Lichtenstein SN-2 was eventually supplanted by the Neptun radar. Based on the same basic technology as the Lichtenstein, the Neptun operated on six mid-VHF frequencies between 158-187MHz. with shorter dipole antennas, still in the \\"antler\\" mounting format. This unit was only a stop-gap solution. Rotterdam Device The Royal Air Force's first Airborne Intercept radars operated in the 1.5 meter band and featured antennas similar to their later German counterparts. However, the introduction of the cavity magnetron in 1940 changed things dramatically. The magnetron efficiently generated microwaves from a device the size of a coffee tin, lowering operational wavelengths from the several-meter range to less than 10 centimeters. This reduced the antenna size to a few centimeters. Instead of simply using a smaller Yagi antenna, the system was paired with a new parabolic dish which allowed for conical scanning. The result was a small, lightweight, powerful, long range and easy to read radar. The magnetron was initially limited to aircraft operating over the UK or sea, so that if the aircraft was lost the magnetron would not fall into German hands. However, as the war progressed several new uses for the magnetron were developed, notably ground-mapping systems like the H2S radar. These allowed the operator to obtain a crude cathode ray tube image of the ground below in any weather. This was of great use to RAF Bomber Command's efforts, and an intense debate broke out over whether to allow its use over continental Europe. In the end the decision was taken to allow H2S units in strategic operations, starting with the Pathfinder Force. The inevitable occurred on 2 February 1943, when a Short Stirling Pathfinder was downed near Rotterdam. German forces examining the wreckage found an apparatus which they called the \\"Rotterdam Ger√§t\\" (Rotterdam Device). They quickly determined it to be a centimeter wavelength generator, although its exact purpose was unclear. This was revealed when a second example was captured, and the crew of the aircraft revealed it to be a mapping system. Wolfgang Martini immediately set up a team to understand the new system and devise countermeasures. This work led to the FuG 350 Naxos device, a radio receiver using a DF loop for an aircraft installation, covered with a teardrop-shaped fairing and tuned to the H2S frequencies, that was used to track the Pathfinders in flight. However, this was introduced just as the RAF was introducing the H2S Mk. III and the US their H2X radar, which operated at 3 cm (10 GHz) and thus was not seen by Naxos. Berlin The captured magnetron was sent to Berlin and a group assembled from the German electronics industry met at the Telefunken offices to discuss it. Only days later those offices were attacked and the magnetron was destroyed. However, a second example was recovered from an aircraft taking part in that raid. Telefunken used it as a basis for a German version of the device and an AI radar based on it. The system which Telefunken developed was similar to its British counterpart, differing largely in the display system. Given the limited number of changes, it is unclear why it took so long to get into production, over two years. Production units were not ready until the spring of 1945, and were not installed in German aircraft until April, just before the war ended. Ju 88G-6 with FuG-240 behind the plywood radome nose The Berlin N-2 model was installed primarily in Junkers Ju 88G-6 night-fighters, behind a plywood radome. This so greatly reduced drag compared to the late-model Lichtensteins and Neptun that the fighters regained their pre-radar speeds. The power output of the N-2 radar was 15 kW, and was effective against bomber-sized targets at distances of up to 9 kilometers, or down to 0.5 kilometer, which eliminated the need for a second short-range radar system. The N-3 version used an updated display system that featured a C-scope output, which simplified the intercept. The N-4 was a further development of the N-3; it rotated the antenna in the horizontal plane under an FuG 350 Naxos-antenna style teardrop housing atop the aircraft fuselage. The result was a 360-degree image of the sky around the aircraft that was presented on a plan position indicator (PPI). This version was later renamed the FuG 244 \\"Bremen\\", but was not approved for production. A year after the end of the war, this American copy appeared as the AN/APS-3.

Life He was born at his father's house in St. James's churchyard, Bristol, on 15 April 1781. His mother was a daughter of Jack Slack (d. 1778), a noted pugilist, who defeated Jack Broughton in April 1750. 'Jem' Belcher followed the trade of a butcher, though he was never formally apprenticed, and signalised himself when a lad by pugilistic and other feats at Lansdown fair. He was a natural fighter, owing little to instruction in the art. His form is described as elegant; he was, at any rate, good-humoured, finely proportioned, and well-looking. He came to London in 1798 and sparred with Bill Warr, a veteran boxer, of Covent Garden. On 12 April 1799, after a fight of thirty-three minutes, he beat Tom Jones of Paddington at Wormwood Scrubbs in the Middleweight Championship of England. He drew with champion Jack Bartholomew in a 51-round bout in 1799, but in the following year, on 18 May 1800, on Finchley Common, the 19-year-old Belcher, after seventeen rounds, knocked out the 37-year-old Bartholomew out with a 'terrific' body blow to win the rematch and become champion. On 22 December 1800, near Abershaw's gibbet on Wimbledon Common, he fought Andrew Gamble, the Irish champion. Four days before the fight, Belcher said that he was attacked by four thugs in Chelsea, whom he proceeded to beat up without getting harmed himself.Jem Belcher from Bristol It was suspected that someone sent those men so he won't be able to fight the high stakes match, but since he couldn't provide evidence the fight still went underway. Belcher defeated Gamble shockingly in only five rounds, Gamble being utterly confounded by his opponent's quickness. On 25 November 1801 he met Joe Berks of Wem, and defeated him after sixteen rounds of desperate fighting. He fought him again on 20 August 1802, and Berks retired at the end of the 14th round, by which time he could scarcely stand and was shockingly cut about the face. In April 1803 he severely punished John Firby, 'the young ruffian,' in a hastily arranged encounter. Next month he had to appear before Lord Ellenborough in the court of king's bench for rioting and fighting, upon which occasion he was defended by Erskine and Francis Const. In July 1803 Belcher lost an eye owing to an accident when playing at rackets. His high spirit and constitution subsequently declined, but placed by his friends in the 'snug tavern' of the Jolly Brewers in Wardour Street, evaded challenges to his title until 1805. Jealousy of a former pupil, Hen Pearce, the 'Bristol game-chicken,' led him once more to try his fortune in the ring. He had a terrible battle with Pearce on Barnby Moor, near Doncaster, on 6 December 1805. He displayed all his old courage but not his old skill or form, and was defeated in 18 rounds. He fought yet again two heroic fights with Tom Cribb ‚Äî the first on 8 April 1807 at Moulsey Hurst in forty-one rounds, when Belcher would have proved the winner but for his confused sight and sprained wrist ‚Äî the second on 1 Feb. 1809, in answer to a challenge for the belt and two hundred guineas. Belcher was again defeated after a punishing fight in thirty-one rounds, though the best judges were of opinion that, had Belcher possessed his once excellent constitution and eyesight, Cribb must have been the loser. This was Belcher's last fight. Virtually ruined by the huge gambling losses he sustained at this fight, he caused a fracas after the bout, for which he spent four weeks in prison. During his career, Belcher was known as \\"The Napoleon of the Ring\\"The Age. \\"More Prize Ring Personalities: 'The Napoleon of the Ring'\\". 18 April 1931, p. 8.

Belcher was one of the gamest fighters ever seen in the prize- ring, and probably the most rapid in his movements : 'you heard his blows, you did not see them.' A truly courageous man. Belcher was in private life good- humoured, modest, and unassuming ; but after his last fight he became taciturn and depressed. He was deserted by most of his old patrons : one of the best of these was Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford, who at his death on 10 March 1804 left him his famous bulldog Trusty. Belcher died on 30 July 1811 at the Coach and Horses, Frith Street, Soho, a property which he left to his widow ; he was interred in the Marylebone burial ground. By the consequence of his various battles, stated the Gentleman's Magazine, aided by great irregularity of living, he had reduced himself to a most pitiable situation for the last eighteen months, and died a broken man. Portraits are given in 'Pugilistica' and Boxiana, in which Pierce Egan remarks upon his likeness to Napoleon. A link between the silver and golden ages of the prize-ring, Belcher was 'as well known to his own generation as Pitt or Wellington.' Like the latter he is commemorated by an article of attire, a 'belcher' or blue-and-white spotted neckerchief, though the term is applied loosely to any particoloured handkerchief tied round the neck. In 1805 a very brief but blood-thirsty 'Treatice (sic) on Boxing by Mr. J. Belcher' was appended to George Barrington's New London Spy for that year.  Tom Belcher  Jim's younger brother, Tom Belcher, was scarcely inferior as a pugilist. He won battles in succession with Dan Dogherty, the 'Young Ruffian' John Firby, and some fighters of less repute, but he was badly defeated by Dutch Sam (Samuel Elias). He was an accomplished boxer and sparrer, and at the Tennis Court, during Tom Cribb's proprietorship, he defeated with the gloves such experts as Shaw the lifeguardsman, John Gully, and the African-American Tom Molineaux. When Tom travelled to face Dogherty at the Curragh of Kildare (23 April 1813), Pierce Egan‚Äôs commentary implies that the Irish fighter was outclassed by the London Fancy's hero: 'Twentieth. ‚Äì Belcher now seemed perfectly at home, and felt convinced how things were going. The length of his arm, added to the advantage of superior science, enabled him to serve out Dogherty about the head with such severity of manner, as to occasion the latter to fall at his feet'.David Snowdon, 'Writing the Prizefight; Pierce Egan's Boxiana World' (Bern, 2013) Tom Belcher, who is described as 'gentlemanly and inoffensive,' died in London on 9 December 1854, aged 71, having earned a competence as tavern-keeper at the Castle, Holborn, subsequently kept by Tom Spring. He is buried in Nunhead Cemetery, London. References in popular culture Belcher features as a character in Rodney Stone, a Gothic mystery and boxing novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The long line was operated for most of its life by the Compagnie des omnibus √©lectriques Fribourg‚ÄìFarvagny, and linked the old Fribourg railway station with Farvagny-le-Grand. It was the first trolleybus system in Switzerland, although a 200-metre-long experimental trolleybus line had operated on a demonstration basis near the Ch√¢teau de Chillon and the Hotel Byron in 1900.  History   Origins  At the start of the 20th century, the ' was founded, with the goal of obtaining a concession for, and constructing, a metre gauge tramway from Fribourg to Les Daillettes, a neighborhood of Villars-sur-Gl√¢ne. It was also intended that the tramway be capable of extension to Bulle. Subsequently, however, the committee learned of the achievements of a new \\"trackless railway\\" in Austria, and in 1908 sent a delegation to inspect it. The \\"trackless railway\\" was the Gm√ºnd Electric Catenary-Automobile Line (), which had been opened in July 1907 as the first network based on the Merc√©d√®s-√âlectrique-Stoll system. As a consequence of the inspection, the committee decided in 1909 to pass up the tramway concession in favour of trolleybuses. Calculations had shown that construction costs for a trolleybus system were likely to be only a third of those of a tramway. The new trolleybus line was proposed to lead from Fribourg via Daillettes to Farvagny. Prior to the bridge over the Gl√¢ne, a branch line about one km (0.6 mi) in length was planned to the hamlet of Sainte-Apolline, also part of Villars-sur-Gl√¢ne. With these transport connections, a noodle factory might be developed at Sainte-Apolline, and relied upon for goods traffic.  Opening  On 31 August 1910, the committee received a concession valid up to 1 September 1915, which in 1912 was finally extended to 1 February 1932. The long section from Fribourg to Posieux went into service as the first part of the line. Test runs on this section began on 15 December 1911, and on 30 December 1911 the opening ceremony was held, before regular services began on 4 January 1912. The depot was located in La Gl√¢ne. The second, Posieux‚ÄìMagnedens (Es Bous) section, which was long, was put into operation on 1 October 1913. This section was, however, temporarily shut down again between August 1914 and August 1915, because the road had to be modified to cater for the new loads. On 1 November 1916, the long Magnedens (Es Bous)‚ÄìFarvagny-le- Grand section was opened. At the Farvagny-le-Grand terminal, a second depot was provided. With the completion of this section, the maximum extent of the line was reached, because the planned branch to Sainte-Apolline was never built.  Decline  As a result of economic difficulties after World War I, an extension of the system to Bulle could no longer be pursued. In addition, the system's vehicles had defects, which were due mainly to the still not very advanced vehicle technology and the poor road conditions. The 1925 schedule included five pairs of trips over the entire route as well as an extra pair over the Fribourg‚ÄìLa Gl√¢ne section. Following the electrification of the Lausanne‚ÄìBern railway by the SBB-CFF-FFS, the Romont‚ÄìBern catenary went into service on 15 May 1927, and the trolleybus overhead wires at the La Gl√¢ne railway crossing had to be dismantled. From then onwards, the electrical contact troller had to be exchanged, in a cumbersome procedure, every time a trolleybus used the level crossing; this task was carried out by an employee of the company's nearby depot. It was not until 1949 that an obstacle-free crossing would again have been possible - in that year, the level crossing was replaced by an overpass further to the east. carriage of mail is separately noted. At that time, a ride over the total system cost two Swiss francs. Management of the system was ceded on 1 April 1929 to the Chemins de fer √©lectriques de la Gruy√®re (CEG), which decided to continue operating the concession until the end of its term on 31 January 1932, but not to extend it. The reasons for this lay, on the one hand, in the desire to extend the line via Farvagny, and, on the other hand, in the slow and laborious procedures when trolleybuses were crossing in opposite directions, and at the railway level crossing. On 21 May 1932, the last scheduled trolleybus service ran along the line. During the system's entire period of operation, a total of 1.5 million persons was transported electrically. From the day following the system's closure, the CEG used only diesel buses, which could run continuously through to Bulle. The normal travel time of 50 minutes by trolleybus fell to just 30 minutes after the change to diesel buses. Today this route is served by regional bus line 336. In the urban area of Fribourg, the Transports publics fribourgeois (TPF) has operated a modern trolleybus network, the Fribourg trolleybus system, since 1949.  Infrastructure  Only a single pair of overhead wires was installed along the entire Fribourg‚ÄìFarvagny route. This catenary arrangement consisted of two copper wires, in diameter, mounted apart. These wires were located at a height of above the roadway. The Mercedes-√âlectrique-Stoll design allowed for a lateral deviation of to . In La Gl√¢ne, and from 1916 also in Farvagny-le-Grand, was a depot with a converter station. The voltage used on the system was 550 volts DC. The standard Merc√©d√®s-√âlectrique-Stoll system contact trollers ran along the wires. They were connected by a cable to the vehicle. Under this arrangement, the vehicles could therefore operate in both directions without the provision of turning loops. When two vehicles travelling in opposite directions needed to cross, the contact trollers were exchanged between the vehicles; the driver unplugged his vehicle and then plugged in the troller of the oncoming vehicle to continue his trip. Fleet Trolleybus no. 3 on the open road. Three passenger-carrying vehicles, with fleet numbers 1 to 3, and a trolleytruck, were acquired for use on the system. Along with the G√ºmmenen‚ÄìM√ºhleberg trackless railway (1918‚Äì1922) ‚Äì which was, however, an exclusively freight carrying operation ‚Äì the Fribourg‚ÄìFarvagny trolleybus system was one of only two trolleytruck operations in Switzerland. However, the trolleytruck was seldom used, due to the lack of a branch line. The manufacturer of all of the vehicles, the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, fabricated the chassis and bodies, and installed the electrical equipment. All four vehicles were delivered in 1911. The trolleybuses offered seventeen seats and seven standing places. They initially had a top speed of , weighed and were equipped with two wheel hub motors with a power output of . The wheels of each vehicle were made of wood. The front wheels were fitted with single-layer solid rubber tyres, and the rear wheels had double layered tyres. The two hub motors were very vulnerable, partly due to the vehicles' lack of suspension, and partly because they were not fully enclosed like their present-day equivalents. These weaknesses led to breakdowns, as the roads were still unpaved dirt roads, causing the motors to suffer from dust exposure. For these reasons, the three trolleybuses were rebuilt between 1917 and 1920. The rebuilding work was carried out by Tribelhorn in Feldbach, and included the installation of new engines. After the rebuilds, the vehicles' top speed was . The weight of cars 1 and 2 was increased to , and car 3 to . The vehicles were painted in a dark red livery, with part of the undercarriage picked out in yellow. So that the passenger-carrying operation could be sustained, a Saurer motorbus of type 32 R was procured in 1917. After the closure of the system in 1932, all vehicles were sold to individual purchasers, and over time all were scrapped.

He was one of the leading landscape painters in Rome in the first half of the 18th century and his patrons included Rome's old aristocratic families as well as European travellers on their Grand Tour.Edgar Peters Bowron, Joseph J.

As his father died when he was only 6 years old van Lint became in 1696 an apprentice of Peeter van Bredael, a painter of Italianate landscapes. Van Lint did not stay to complete his apprenticeship but left for Rome somewhere between 1697 and 1700. Here he would stay for the remainder of his life except for a short visit to Antwerp in 1710 after the death of his mother.Hendrik Frans van Lint at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Landscape with the Nurture of Jupiter In 1697, van Lint joined the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Van Lint's bent name was: studie (in Dutch) or lo studio (and even 'Mons√∫ Studio') (in Italian). This nickname may have been given him because of his meticulous technique, which relied on extensive preparatory work and studies. He was in the habit of making detailed drawings in pencil, pen and wash, often in situ.Hendrik Frans van Lint, lo Studio (Antwerp 1684-1763 Rome) An extensive Italianate wooded landscape at Christie‚Äôs He would frequently go on expeditions lasting up to a few weeks to the countryside around Rome.

Van Wittel had settled in Rome in 1675 where his topographical views had made him one of the most feted artists of his generation. Van Lint possibly worked in van Wittel's workshop to assist the aging artist in the completion of his many commissions. Van Lint had a successful career and his patrons included eminent visitors to Rome and aristocrats on their Grand Tour, as well as some of the great patrician Roman families, including the Altoviti, Capponi, Pamphili, Sacchetti and Soderini. Don Lorenzo Colonna particularly liked his work and owned no less than 70 landscapes by the artist. Van Lint's wife died in 1744.Rome, A View of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini at Robilant+Voena The same year he joined the Congregazione Artistica dei Virtuosi al Pantheon and was elected its Rector in 1755.Hendrick Frans van Lint, lo Studio (Antwerp 1684-1763 Rome), The watermill or the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca, and A classical river landscape with figures on a path and a palace in the distance at Christie‚Äôs The Congregazione was a corporation of artists who organised annual exhibitions of their own paintings on the metal railings in front of the Pantheon. Van Lint probably also worked as a picture restorer. He died in his house on via del Babuino in Rome on 24 September 1763. Work Van Lint was specialized in landscapes which fall globally in two categories: idealized landscapes of people in nature and ‚Äòvedute‚Äô, landscapes or town views that are mainly topographical in conception. Among his earliest dated works produced in Rome are paintings from 1711, including View of a monastery on the Aventine, now in the collection of the Galleria Doria Pamphili. It has been suggested that this was the year in which he left van Wittel's workshop to strike out on his own. View of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini in Rome His idealized landscapes follow less the style of his contemporaries and compatriots Abraham Genoels and Jan Frans van Bloemen, who specialized in this subject matter. Van Lint went in a different direction under the influence of Claude Lorrain's Arcadian landscapes. Van Lint may have studied Lorrain's works in numerous Roman collections. It has been suggested that van Lint started out as a reluctant copyist of the work of Lorrain whose work was in strong demand but unavailable on the market. It was only later that he started to paint his own compositions inspired by and dotted with references to Lorrain as well as Nicolas Poussin. View of the Titus Arch and Palatine in Rome A good example of the influence of Lorraine on his idealized landscapes are the pair of paintings entitled Landscape with a Watermill and Dancing Figures (The Wedding of Isaac and Rebecca) and Landscape with the Nurture of Jupiter (private collections). The two compositions are directly inspired by Lorrain's monumental pair of landscapes in the Galleria Doria Pamphilij, Rome. In particular the first work is directly based on Lorrain's Landscape with Dancing Figures (The Mill), while the second is only inspired in its overall design by Claude's original of the View of Delphi with a procession. Van Lint was no slavish follower of Lorrain but rather an inventor of his own as shown by the fact that he introduced a number of elements that are absent from Claude's work, such as the hound in the centre or the shepherd leading his flock over a bridge. Van Lint also shows that he is at heart a vedute painter who preferred realistic views by substituting for Claude's fantastical domed palace a representation of the Colosseum and a monument that he had depicted on numerous occasions in his Roman vedute and may be based on an existing feature in Rome.Hendrik Frans van Lint, A Landscape with the Nurture of Jupiter at Sotheby‚Äôs Like Lorrain, van Lint paid particular attention to the trees in his compositions. His wide open compositions are imbued with silence and invite contemplation.Hendrik Frans van Lint, called le Studio (Antwerp 1684 - Rome 1763), Landscape with a Watermill and Dancing Figures (The Wedding of Isaac and Rebecca) at Gallerie Canesso It has been argued that van Lint adapted Lorrain's style to 18th- century taste by using paler and clearer tones, prettier colours and sharper handling.Hendrik Frans van Lint, View of Tivoli at the Victoria and Albert Museum Campo Vaccino, Rome In his topographical views van Lint was first directed by his experience working for van Wittel. His earliest topographical views (vedute dal vero) of Rome included sweeping panoramic views of the city from many different approaches and locations. Eventually he painted everything worth seeing in Rome which resulted in many views of similar subjects such as the Colosseum, the Arch of Constantine, the Pyramid of Cestius, and the Baths of Diocletian and Caracalla. Van Lint painted many views of Rome's bridges, which he rendered with a mixture of naturalism and poetry. His sharp powers of observation make him stand out as a vedute painter in the 18th century. Van Lint painted also many views of the waterways, waterfalls and harbours around Rome and beyond. These include views of Naples and Venice, cities for which there is no documentary evidence that he actually traveled there. It is likely he developed these compositions on the basis of van Wittel's treatment of similar subjects. While van Lint is known to have employed other artists such as Corrado Giaquinto, Adriaen Manglard, Anton Raphael Mengs, Pierre Subleyras, Sebastiano Conca, Giuseppe Chiari and Placido Costanzi to paint the staffage in his landscapes, he often painted the figures himself. The only artists whose figures have been identified in his work are Pompeo Batoni and Francesco Zuccarelli. The figures he painted in his compositions were often inspired by those of famous painters of the 17th century such as Guido Reni. Henry Hoare's print collection at Stourhead is thought to have been hand-coloured in a collaborative effort by Hendrik van Lint and his son, Giacomo. In a manuscript catalogue the colouring of these prints is attributed to a 'Mr Studio'. The technique is consistent with Hendrik van Lint's paintings but evidence, including a recorded comment regarding the 'young Studio', suggests that the colouring may have been a family enterprise.
