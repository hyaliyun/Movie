He is widely known for his sports writing and for helping to found The Paris Review, as well as his patrician demeanor and accent. He was also famous for \\"participatory journalism\\" which included competing in professional sporting events, acting in a Western, performing a comedy act at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and playing with the New York Philharmonic OrchestraThe Best of Plimpton, p. 72 and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur. Early life Plimpton was born in New York City on March 18, 1927, and spent his childhood there, attending St. Bernard's School and growing up in an apartment duplex on Manhattan's Upper East Side located at 1165 Fifth Avenue.Aldrich, p. 18 During the summers, he lived in the hamlet of West Hills, Huntington, Suffolk County on Long Island. He was the son of Francis T. P. Plimpton and the grandson of Frances Taylor Pearsons and George Arthur Plimpton.Chase, p. 140Chase, p. 110Chase, p. 86Chase, p. 85Calvin Gay Plimpton and Priscilla G. Lewis were the parents of George Arthur Plimpton. see Chase pp. 85‚Äì86Miller, pp. 31‚Äì33 His father was a successful corporate lawyer and partner of the law firm Debevoise and Plimpton; he was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations, serving from 1961 to 1965.Aldrich, p. 19 His mother was Pauline Ames, the daughter of botanist Oakes Ames and artist Blanche Ames. Both of Plimpton's maternal grandparents were born with the surname Ames; his mother was the granddaughter of Medal of Honor recipient Adelbert Ames (1835-1933), an American sailor, soldier, and politician, and Oliver Ames, a US political figure and the 35th Governor of Massachusetts (1887‚Äì1890). She was also the great-granddaughter on her father's side of Oakes Ames (1804‚Äì1873), an industrialist and congressman who was implicated in the Cr√©dit Mobilier railroad scandal of 1872; and Governor-General of New Orleans Benjamin Franklin Butler, an American lawyer and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and later served as the 33rd Governor of Massachusetts.He was widely reviled for years after the war by Southern whites, who gave him the nickname \\"Beast Butler.\\" He is also credited with saving Baltimore, Maryland during the Civil War. George had three siblings: Francis Taylor Pearsons Plimpton Jr., Oakes Ames Plimpton, and Sarah Gay Plimpton. Education Plimpton attended St. Bernard's School, Phillips Exeter Academy (from which he was expelled just shy of graduation), and Mainland High School, where he received his high school diploma before entering Harvard College in July 1944. He wrote for the Harvard Lampoon, was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, Pi Eta, the Signet Society, and the Porcellian Club. He majored in English. Plimpton entered Harvard as a member of the Class of 1948, but did not graduate until 1950 due to intervening military service. He was also an accomplished birdwatcher. Plimpton's studies were interrupted by military service lasting from 1945 to 1948, during which he served as a tank driver in Italy for the U.S. Army. After graduating from Harvard, he attended King's College at Cambridge University in England. He studied there from 1950 to 1952 and graduated with third class honors, BA in English. Career =Literary criticism= In 1953, Plimpton joined the influential literary journal The Paris Review, founded by Peter Matthiessen, Thomas H. Guinzburg, and Harold L. \\"Doc\\" Humes, becoming its first editor in chief. This periodical has carried great weight in the literary world, but has never been financially strong; for its first half-century, it was allegedly largely financed by its publishers and by Plimpton. Peter Matthiessen took the magazine over from Humes and ousted him as editor, replacing him with Plimpton, using it as his cover for his CIA activities. Jean Stein became his co-editor. Plimpton was associated with the literary magazine in Paris, Merlin, which folded because the State Department withdrew its support. Future Poet Laureate Donald Hall, who had met Plimpton at Exeter, was Poetry Editor. One of the magazine's most notable discoveries was author and screenplay writer Terry Southern, who was living in Paris at the time and formed a lifelong friendship with Plimpton, along with writer Alexander Trocchi and future classical and jazz pioneer David Amram. =Sports journalism= Outside the literary world, Plimpton was famous for competing in professional sporting events and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur. In 1958, prior to a post-season exhibition game at Yankee Stadium between teams managed by Willie Mays (National League) and Mickey Mantle (American League), Plimpton pitched against the National League. His experience was captured in the book Out of My League. (He intended to face both line-ups, but tired badly and was relieved by Ralph Houk.) Plimpton sparred for three rounds with boxing greats Archie Moore and Sugar Ray Robinson while on assignment for Sports Illustrated. In 1963, Plimpton attended preseason training with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League as a backup quarterback, and he ran a few plays in an intrasquad scrimmage. These events were recalled in his best-known book Paper Lion, which was later adapted into a 1968 feature film starring Alan Alda. Plimpton revisited pro football in 1971, this time joining the Baltimore Colts and seeing action in an exhibition game against his previous team, the Lions. These experiences served as the basis of another football book, Mad Ducks and Bears, although much of the book dealt with the off-field escapades and observations of football friends Alex Karras (\\"Mad Duck\\") and John Gordy (\\"Bear\\").Almond, Steve. \\"Mad Ducks and Bears,\\" The Paris Review, April 26, 2016. Retrieved December 2, 2019 Another sports book, Open Net, saw him train as an ice hockey goalie with the Boston Bruins, even playing part of a National Hockey League preseason game. Plimpton's The Bogey Man chronicles his attempt to play professional golf on the PGA Tour during the Nicklaus and Palmer era of the 1960s. Among other challenges for Sports Illustrated, he attempted to play top-level bridge, and spent some time as a high-wire circus performer. Some of these events, such as his stint with the Colts, and an attempt at stand-up comedy, were presented on the ABC television network as a series of specials. In 1994 Plimpton appeared several times in the Ken Burns series Baseball, in which he shared some personal baseball experiences as well as other memorable events throughout the history of baseball.Baseball: A film by Ken Burns, PBS, 2010, Retrieved December 27, 2013. =Sidd Finch= In the April 1, 1985 issue of Sports Illustrated, Plimpton pulled off a widely reported April Fools' Day prank. With the help of the New York Mets organization and several Mets players, Plimpton wrote a convincing account of a new unknown pitcher in the Mets spring training camp named Siddhartha Finch who threw a baseball over 160 mph, wore a heavy boot on one foot, and was a practicing Buddhist with a largely unknown background. The prank was so successful that many readers believed the story, and the ensuing popularity of the joke resulted in Plimpton writing an entire book on Finch. =Other writing= A friend of the New England Sedgwick family, Plimpton edited Edie: An American Biography with Jean Stein in 1982. He also appeared in a brief interview about Edie Sedgwick in the DVD extra for the film Ciao! Manhattan. He appeared in the PBS American Masters documentary on Andy Warhol. Plimpton also appeared in the closing credits of the 2006 film Factory Girl. Between 2000 and 2003, Plimpton wrote the libretto to a new opera, Animal Tales, commissioned by Family Opera Initiative, with music by Kitty Brazelton directed by Grethe Barrett Holby. He wrote, \\"I suppose in a mild way there is a lesson to be learned for the young, or the young at heart ‚Äì the gumption to get out and try one's wings\\". =Acting= Plimpton also appeared in a number of feature films as an extra and in cameo appearances. He had a small role in the Oscar-winning film Good Will Hunting, playing a psychologist. Plimpton played Tom Hanks's antagonistic father in Volunteers. He was also notable for his appearance in television commercials during the early 1980s, including a memorable campaign for Mattel's Intellivision. In this campaign, Plimpton aggressively touted the superiority of Intellivision video games over those of competitors such as the Atari 2600. He hosted Disney Channel's Mouseterpiece Theater (a Masterpiece Theatre spoof which featured Disney cartoon shorts). In the \\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\\" episode of The Simpsons, he hosts the \\"Spellympics\\" and attempts to bribe Lisa Simpson to lose with the offer of a scholarship at a Seven Sisters College and a hot plate; \\"it's perfect for soup!\\" He had a recurring role as the grandfather of Dr. Carter on the NBC series ER. He also appeared in an episode of the NBC sitcom Wings. Plimpton appeared in the 1989 documentary The Tightrope Dancer which featured the life and the work of the artist Vali Myers. He was one of her original supporters and had published an article about her work in The Paris Review. He also appeared in the 1996 documentary When We Were Kings about the \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" 1974 Ali-Foreman Championship fight opposite Norman Mailer crediting Muhammad Ali as a poet who composed the world's shortest poem: \\"Me? Whee!!\\" Plimpton was a member of the cast of the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì02). In 2013, the documentary Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself, directed by Tom Bean and Luke Poling, was released. The film used archival audio and video of Plimpton lecturing and reading to create a posthumous narration. =Fireworks= Plimpton was a demolitions expert in the post-World War II Army. After returning to New York from Paris, he routinely fired off fireworks at his evening parties. His enthusiasm for fireworks grew, and he was appointed Fireworks Commissioner of New York by Mayor John Lindsay, an unofficial post he held until his death. In 1975, in Bellport, Long Island, Plimpton, with Fireworks by Grucci attempted to break the record for the world's largest firework. His firework, a Roman candle named \\"Fat Man\\", weighed and was expected to rise to or more and deliver a wide starburst. When lit, the firework remained on the ground and exploded, blasting a crater wide and deep. A later attempt, fired at Cape Canaveral, rose approximately into the air and broke 700 windows in Titusville, Florida. With Felix Grucci, Plimpton competed in the 16th International Fireworks Festival in 1979 in Monte Carlo. After several problems with transporting and preparing the fireworks, Plimpton and Grucci became the first competitors from the United States to win the event. Plimpton later wrote the book Fireworks, and hosted an A&E; Home Video with the same name featuring his many fireworks adventures with the Gruccis of New York in Monte Carlo and for the 1983 Brooklyn Bridge Centennial. =Parodies of Plimpton's career= A November 6, 1971, cartoon in The New Yorker by Whitney Darrow Jr. shows a cleaning lady on her hands and knees scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: \\"I'd like to see George Plimpton do this sometime.\\" In another cartoon in The New Yorker, a patient looks up at the masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, \\"Wait a minute! How do I know you're not George Plimpton?\\" A feature in Mad titled \\"Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton\\" spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square in the middle of the night, and spending a week with Jerry Lewis. Personal life Plimpton was married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1968 and divorced in 1988, was Freddy Medora Espy, a photographer's assistant. She was the daughter of writers Willard R. Espy and Hilda S. Cole, who had, earlier in her career, been a publicity agent for Kate Smith and Fred Waring. They had two children: Medora Ames Plimpton and Taylor Ames Plimpton, who has published a memoir entitled Notes from the Night: A Life After Dark. Plimpton with Herb Caen and Ann Moller in 1993 In 1992, Plimpton married Sarah Whitehead Dudley, a graduate of Columbia University and a freelance writer. She is the daughter of James Chittenden Dudley, a managing partner of Manhattan-based investment firm Dudley and Company, and geologist Elisabeth Claypool. The Dudleys established the Highstead Arboretum in Redding, Connecticut. Plimpton and Dudley were the parents of twin daughters Laura Dudley Plimpton and Olivia Hartley Plimpton. =Friendship with Robert F. Kennedy= At Harvard, Plimpton was a classmate and close personal friend of Robert F. Kennedy. Plimpton, along with former decathlete Rafer Johnson and American football star Rosey Grier, was credited with helping wrestle Sirhan Sirhan to the floor when Kennedy was assassinated following his victory in the 1968 California Democratic primary at the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. Kennedy died the next day at Good Samaritan Hospital. Death and tributes Plimpton died on September 25, 2003, in his New York City apartment from a heart attack later determined to have been caused by a catecholamine surge. He was 76.https://www.thenation.com/article/his-league-being-george-plimpton/ An oral biography titled George, Being George was edited by Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., and released on October 21, 2008. The book offers memories of Plimpton from among other writers, such as Norman Mailer, William Styron, Gay Talese and Gore Vidal, and was written with the cooperation of both his ex-wife and his widow. In the movie Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself, the writer James Salter said of Plimpton that \\"he was writing in a genre that really doesn't permit greatness.\\" In 2006, the musician Jonathan Coulton wrote the song entitled \\"A Talk with George\\", a part of his 'Thing a Week' series, in tribute to Plimpton's many adventures and approach to life. Plimpton is the protagonist of the semi-fictional George Plimpton's Video Falconry, a 1983 ColecoVision game postulated by humorist John Hodgman and recreated by video game auteur Tom Fulp. Researcher and writer Samuel Arbesman filed with NASA to name an asteroid after Plimpton; NASA issued the certificate 7932 Plimpton in 2009.7932 Plimpton (1989 GP), ssd.jpl.nasa.gov; accessed October 26, 2015. His final interview appeared in The New York Sports Express of Oct. 2, 2003 by journalist Dave Hollander.

Kaufman. When Kaufman sold the chain in 1987, there were 270 restaurants operated by 220 franchisees. During the 1970s, several locations operated in Honolulu on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. As of 2017, there are only two locations remaining, one in the Boyle Heights district of Los Angeles and the other in Bell Gardens, California, both unrelated former franchises. Origins It was named after Pioneer Market, a now-defunct small chain of supermarkets in Los Angeles. The original location in Echo Park was located next to the 1980s-era Pioneer Market (the original 1932 market was razed in the 1980s due to the Sylmar earthquake) at Echo Park Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, which was replaced by a Walgreens Pharmacy in 2004. Due to considerable redevelopment activity in the neighborhood, the original Pioneer Chicken location was shut down in March 2009 and replaced by a Little Caesar's Pizza the following year. During the 1980s, Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick Hearn and former football player O.J. Simpson advertised for the restaurant. Pioneer Chicken was remembered for its bright orange deep fried chicken, menu option of gizzards and livers as appetizers, Pioneer Pete the company mascot and main character in comic books that were provided with their kid's meals. Bankruptcy In 1988 founder H. R. Kaufman and business associate Terrence P. Goggin filed for Chapter 11 in Federal Bankruptcy Court. At that point, Pioneer Chicken had 220 franchise owners and 270 stores. The company faltered under competition pressure from Kentucky Fried Chicken. AFC Enterprises acquisition In 1993, Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits owner AFC Enterprises purchased the franchise and converted most locations to Popeyes. Locations There are two remaining locations in the Los Angeles area: 1) 904 S. Soto Street, Los Angeles; 2) 6323 E. Florence Avenue, Bell Gardens. =In Indonesia= In 1983, three alumni from the University of Southern California decided to open a Pioneer Chicken franchise in Jakarta under the name California Fried Chicken. Link via LexisNexis. (English translation of webpage) via Google Translate. As of 2013, the parent company of the stores in Indonesia, Pioneerindo Gourmet International, have over 200 CFC restaurants throughout that nation. CFC had a few franchises in Shanghai during the 1990s, but they may not currently exist. Media Warren Zevon's song \\"Carmelita\\" refers to Pioneer Chicken: \\"I pawned my Smith Corona/And I went to meet my man / He hangs out down on Alvarado Street/By the Pioneer chicken stand\\". In The Aquabats 1997 song \\"Magic Chicken!\\", the singer invites the listener to \\"Do the Pioneer!\\" during a funk breakdown where various chicken restaurant franchises are named. The opening of the film The Last American Virgin shows a Pioneer Chicken location at the northeast corner of Hollywood & Western in the background as the protagonist Gary (Lawrence Monoson), drives off making a pizza delivery. The same location is shown in one scene in Death Wish II and towards the end of the music video for DeBarge's \\"Rhythm Of The Night\\" A Pioneer Chicken location is briefly shown in the background in the 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High during the restaurant scene involving the dissatisfied customer. The site was located on San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood, Los Angeles. The Silverlake location can be seen in the background of The Hollywood Strangler Meets the Skid Row Slasher. A Pioneer Chicken outlet is shown at the beginning of Armed And Dangerous when one of the film's protagonists, Frank Dooley (John Candy) is on patrol just before he is framed. In the first season opening montage of the television series Full House, a jumbo pack box of chicken is shown next to baby Michelle with the slogan \\"Home of the Golden Pioneer Chicken\\" on the side. This montage is also seen in the first episode of the reboot Fuller House. The pilot episode of The White Shadow shows Pioneer Chicken in the last 15 minutes of the episode as the team travels down the boulevard. Pioneer Chicken was also seen in the \\"Brat Patrol\\" episode of the TV series CHiPs. In the Hughes Brothers documentary American Pimp the Pioneer Chicken 904 S.

History The New Zealand Post Office, a government agency, provided postal, banking, and telecommunications services in New Zealand until 1987. By the 1980s, however, economic difficulties made the government reconsider how it delivered postal services. For example, in 1987-1988, the postal division lost NZ$50 million. In 1985, the Labour Party government under Prime Minister David Lange launched a review, led by New Zealand Motor Corporation CEO Roy Mason and KPMG New Zealand Chairman Michael Morris, to find solutions to the Post Office's problems. In its final report, the team recommended transforming the New Zealand Post Office into three state-owned enterprises. The government in 1986 decided to follow the Mason-Morris review's recommendations, and passed through parliament the State-Owned Enterprises Act, which corporatised several government agencies into state- owned enterprises. The Post Office's corporatisation was then completed with the 1987 passage of the Postal Services Act. The two acts broke up the New Zealand Post Office into three corporations: the postal service firm New Zealand Post Limited, the savings bank Post Office Bank Limited, later rebranded as PostBank, and the telecommunications company Telecom New Zealand Limited. Today, only New Zealand Post remains a state-owned enterprise, as PostBank and Telecom were privatised in 1989 and 1990, respectively. In its first year of operation, New Zealand Post turned the losses of previous years into a NZ$72 million profit. A year after the 1987 Post Office Act, the Lange Government declared its plan to fully privatise the post. To prepare for privatisation, it decided to gradually reduce NZ Post's monopoly. When it was corporatised in 1987, New Zealand Post had a monopoly for mail up to 500 grams and NZ$1.75 value. This was first reduced to $1.35, then $1, and finally 80 cents. The government also let NZ Post downsize by closing a third of its locations. In 1991-1992, another review came out in support of the government's privatisation plan. However, by the end of 1993 the government abandoned its plan because of public opposition. New Zealand Post began its life with 1,244 post offices, later rebranded as PostShops, of which 906 were full post offices and 338 were postal agencies. After government subsidies expired in February 1988, 600 post offices or bank branches were downsized or closed. As of March 1998, there were 297 PostShops and 705 Post Centres. However, there are now more outlets than before corporatisation, with 2,945 other retailers of postage stamps. There was a reduction in the \\"real\\" price of postage, with a nominal drop of the postage rate from 45 cents to 40 cents in 1996, and restoration of the 45 cent rate in 2004. Since then the cost has risen to 50 cents in 2007, to 60 cents in 2010 and to 70 cents in 2012. On 1 July 2016 postage for standard letters will increase by 20 cents to $1.00 and Fastpost by 40 cents to $1.80. Regulation The Lange government's Postal Services Act 1987 reduced the monopoly of New Zealand Post to a limit of $1.75 and 500 grams. It was gradually reduced to 80 cents in December 1991 until the 1998 legislation took effect. Since the deregulation of the postal sector, different postal operators can install mail collection boxes in New Zealand's streets. The Postal Services Act 1998, passed by a National-New Zealand First coalition government, repealed the 1987 Act. The new law provides for any person to become a registered postal operator by applying to the Ministry of Economic Development (now Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment). Registration as a postal operator is compulsory for letters with postage less than 80 cents. Despite the Act, government regulation of the company still requires it to maintain certain minimum service levels, such as frequency of delivery. New Zealand Post's exclusive right to be the 'sole operator' under the Act for the purposes of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) expired on 1 April 2003. For practical purposes, this meant another postal operator could theoretically issue stamps identified simply as 'New Zealand' with UPU membership. At around the same time, New Zealand Post adopted a fern-shaped identifying mark on its postage stamps, to be used on the majority of its future issues. Since 1998 New Zealand Post has been legally obliged to deliver six days a week, but in 2013 the company outlined a plan to reduce this to three, in the wake of falling mail volumes. Prime Minister John Key backed the idea, saying people \\"genuinely understand that the world is changing\\". New Zealand Post is legally obligated to maintain a certain service level under a deed of understanding it signed with the New Zealand government following the post's corporatisation in 1987. According to the agreement, last amended in 2013, New Zealand Post has to operate at least 880 service points where basic postal services are available, and within this network 240 so-called ‚ÄúPersonal Assistance Service Points,‚Äù where additional postal services, such as priority or parcel services, are available. As of 30 June 2016, New Zealand Post maintained 987 service points, 511 which were personal assistance service points. In all, the post operated 882 retail locations in mid-2016. The standard of signature/non-signature parcel delivery services, varies with their customers sometimes left a mailbox card instructing them to pick up parcels from the nearest NZ Post Depot or if a small address discrepancy/address damage is discovered, the parcel is invariably returned to the sender, usually with no efforts directed toward telephoning, emailing or looking up the recipient in a directory, whist more effort is prioritised into delivering miss-addressed letters.

In 1989 New Zealand Post established CourierPost, a nationwide courier company designed to protect the company's parcel business from private competition. By 1998 CourierPost had become the number one player in the express courier market.CourierPost Profile. Web.archive.org (17 May 2000). Retrieved on 2013-07-16. In 1999 New Zealand Post launched a 50:50 joint operation with Blue Star. The new brand ‚Äì Books and More ‚Äì combined bookshop operations with the more traditional PostShop services. After acquiring 100% of the company in 2004 (by this stage the other 50% had been owned by WH Smith, owner of Whitcoulls bookshops) the entire operation was eventually sold to Paper Plus in 2005 and by 2006 all had been re-branded as Take Note.Media release ‚Äì 2 February 2004 In 2002 New Zealand Post, as part of government policy, opened the bank Kiwibank Limited in the majority of its PostShop and Books and More (now Take Note) branches.

New Zealand Post also owned 35% of IT firm Datacom Group until December 2012. New Zealand Post also runs the Electoral Enrolment Centre as a business unit under contract to the Ministry of Justice. Its function is to compile and maintain all electoral rolls for parliamentary and local government elections. On 6 July 2010, New Zealand Post registered a 100 percent stake in Localist Limited, a local directory and social media site focusing initially on the Auckland region.View All Details.

By end of June 2011, New Zealand Post will have 910 postal outlets and 280 PostShop Kiwibank stores after shuts and downgrades more than a dozen branches nationwide. To compensate, the company was also planning to install new self-service kiosks similar to ATMs for handling letters, bill payments and parcels. One of the ways New Zealand Post is trying to make up for lost revenue due to fewer people sending letters is partnering with other companies. The Post on 3 April 2017 announced that it will work with fast food restaurant chain KFC to have postal drivers deliver KFC's food to customers. The partnership will be piloted in the northern city of Tauranga, then expanded to more locations across New Zealand. =Issue of stamps= New Zealand Post is responsible for deciding on stamp design and stamp production. Only New Zealand Post is allowed to ‚Äúissue postage stamps that bear the words ‚ÄúNew Zealand,‚Äù according to New Zealand law. Each year the Post's stamp business unit sets how many stamps it will issue and what the stamps will depict. The Post considers suggestions from New Zealand citizens and people around the world when deciding the subject of stamps. It also works with organizations to create commemorative stamps. For example, in 2014, the Post collaborated with Air New Zealand to issue a stamp for the airline's 75th anniversary. Once a decision on the stamp's subject is made, the Post asks at least two designers to draw a sketch, from which the final design is chosen. There are four things each stamp design must include: the stamp's denomination, the words New Zealand, a fern, one of the country's unofficial symbols, and a description of what the stamp depicts. Finally, the Post uses printers from around the world to print the stamps‚Äìit does not print them itself. New Zealand's first stamp was issued by New Zealand Post's predecessor, the Post Office Department of the New Zealand government, in 1855. The stamp depicted Queen Victoria, then the Queen of New Zealand, and was printed in one penny, two pence and one shilling denominations.

Life He was born in Campinas, Empire of Brazil, son of Maestro Manuel Jos√© Gomes and Fabiana Maria Jaguari Cardoso. His childhood's musical tendencies were soon stimulated by his father and by his older brother, Jos√© Pedro de Sant'Ana Gomes, also a conductor. Jos√© Pedro was the most dedicated guide and adviser in his brother's artistic career. He convinced Ant√¥nio to visit the Court where he became a prot√©g√© of Emperor Dom Pedro II, who, being notoriously interested in the careers of Brazilian artists and intellectuals, made it possible for Ant√¥nio Carlos to study at the Musical Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro. After having graduated with honours, Carlos produced his first opera, A noite do castelo (September 1861), which was a big success. Two years later, he repeated it with his second opera, Joana de Flandres, which was considered superior to the first. These two pieces convinced the Emperor to offer him a Royal scholarship to study in Italy in 1864. He studied in Milan at the local conservatory with Lauro Rossi and Alberto Mazzucato and completed in three years a course which was normally completed in four years, obtaining the title of Maestro Composer. Interested in composing an opera which dealt with a truly Brazilian subject, Carlos Gomes chose as the theme of his next work the romance novel O Guarani, by Brazilian writer Jos√© de Alencar. The opera was given an Indian subject and setting and it premiered in May 1870 at the La Scala Theater in Milan as Il Guarany. The success was enormous. Even the most strict musical critics compared the Brazilian musician to the great European maestros, such as Rossini and Verdi. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II, decorated the creator of the opera, which was presented in all major European capitals. Before that year was over, Gomes returned to Brazil, where he organized the premiere of Il Guarany in Rio de Janeiro. The piece achieved the same success Gomes had seen in Italy. O Guarany Returning to Italy, Carlos Gomes married Adelina Peri, an Italian pianist he had met while studying in Milan. He wrote the hymn Il saluto del Brasile for the centenary of American independence which was performed in Philadelphia, on July 19, 1876. In 1883 the maestro traveled to Brazil, receiving homages in every city he visited. When he returned to Italy, he dedicated himself to the composition of an opera themed against slavery, inspired by the liberation struggle of black slaves in Brazil, which got the title of Lo schiavo. The composition, which had been suggested by a great friend of Ant√¥nio's, a black engineer named Andr√© Rebou√ßas, only debuted several years later in 1889. When the Brazilian republic was proclaimed in 1889, Carlos Gomes, who at this time was in Campinas, sailed once more to Italy. Faithful to the Brazilian monarchy and Dom Pedro II, Gomes refused the opportunity given to him by president Deodoro da Fonseca to compose the new Brazilian National Anthem. In the following years, he composed the opera Condor and the cantata Colombo, for the Columbus Festival (October 12, 1892), in celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America. Invited by the governor of the Brazilian province of Par√° to direct the Musical Conservatory, the maestro traveled to the capital Bel√©m, willing to take the position. However, shortly after arriving, Carlos Gomes, by then an elderly man in poor health, died on September 16, 1896. Besides his eight operas, he composed songs (3 books), choruses, and piano pieces.

It produced some of the world's most innovative and best-known airplanes over the course of its fifty- plus year history in Dessau, Germany. It was founded there in 1895 by Hugo Junkers, initially manufacturing boilers and radiators. During World War I, and following the war, the company became famous for its pioneering all-metal aircraft. During World War II the company produced some of the most successful Luftwaffe planes, as well as piston and jet aircraft engines, albeit in the absence of its founder, who had been removed by the Nazis in 1934. History =World War I= The pioneering all-metal Junkers J 1 in late 1915 J.I is at the Canada Aviation Museum. The history of Junkers aircraft production begins with the Junkers J 1 mid-wing monoplane (not to be confused with the later, all-metal sesquiplane ground attack aircraft with the IdFlieg designation J.I which had a factory designation of J 4). Research for this aircraft began in 1914 and was interrupted by the start of the First World War. The prototype aircraft, named the Blechesel (Tin or Sheet-metal Donkey), was completed in very late 1915 after the outbreak of the war. This aircraft is significant in that it was the first flyable aircraft to utilize an all- metal \\"total structural\\" design. Contemporary aircraft were built around wooden frames constructed in a rib-and-stringer fashion, reinforced with wires, and covered with a stretched fabric. The J 1 was a semi-monocoque design, using steel ribs and sheeting that formed both the stringers and the skin. At the time aluminium was still fairly expensive and the desirable, newest light duralumin alloy could not be worked in sheet form without damaging flaking occurring, so the J 1 was made of sheet electrical steel. It was quite heavy as a result, which translated into poor climb and maneuverability, yet its clean monoplane layout, which even featured a \\"belly\\" radiator installation for its Mercedes D.II inline-six cylinder engine, had very low drag, and the J 1 was one of the fastest aircraft of its day, reaching speeds of 170 km/h, with only a 120 hp engine for power. Following the J 1, a series of \\"J-designated\\" (by the Junkers firm itself) aircraft followed, each advancing the state of the art in terms of strength and weight, but no single design progressed much beyond the prototype stage in terms of production potential. The Junkers J 2 was an extensively \\"cleaned up\\" and armed single-seat fighter descendent of the J 1, while the J 3, a never- completed single rotary engined mid-wing monoplane design that only consisted of covered wing panels and a nearly complete fuselage frame, replaced the smooth exterior electrical steel sheeting with corrugated duralumin. IdFlieg, in charge of aircraft evaluation, was unconvinced of the monoplane layout of these designs, and ordered a sesquiplane design as the J 4. Junkers took this opportunity to produce all the flying surfaces (wings and horizontal stabilizer) of the J 4 aircraft of corrugated duralumin (except for some fabric on the rear fuselage, and the armored steel fuselage \\"bathtub\\") in order to lower weight. The J 4 became Junkers' first design to enter production, with orders totalling 283, of which about 184 were delivered to operational units. Since it was the first design from Junkers to serve in the Luftstreitkr√§fte's \\"J-class\\" of armored, infantry co-operation aircraft, which also had the Albatros J.I and AEG J.I serving with it in the same capacity, the curious and confusing instance of the Junkers J 4 armored all-metal sesquiplane getting the German military designation \\"J.I\\" was one caused solely by the Luftstreitkr√§fte's choice of designation letter for all of its armored, ground forces co-operation aircraft. Junkers continued to believe in the monoplane layout constructed entirely in metal, and continued the J-series with a number of newer monoplane designs. One of the most successful was the all-duralumin J 7 technology demonstrator aircraft prototype, which went through five major and minor changes in its airframe design during tests throughout 1917 and which was later stretched to form the two-seat J 8. The J 8 was the first cantilever monoplane design, and looked extremely \\"modern\\" when compared to contemporary wire-braced biplane designs. The J 8 was put into limited production by the Junkers-Fokker Werke (a collaborative firm founded through strong influence of the German government on October 20, 1917) as the J 10, receiving the IdFlieg designation of CL.I, a small number of which saw service on the Eastern Front just before the war ended. Likewise, the single-seat J 7 itself led to the J 9 design, built in small numbers as the Junkers D.I low wing fighter by both the Junkers firm itself (abbreviated \\"Jco\\" or \\"Jko\\") and the Junkers-Fokker-Werke AG (abbreviated \\"Jfa\\") ‚Äî with the resulting three-letter abbreviation of either firm usually marked on the J-9's landing gear wheel covers. The corrugated duralumin wing and fuselage \\"skin\\" introduced in the J-series became a trademark of Junkers aircraft built in the 1920s and '30s. Development continued during the course of World War I, including a growing (but troublesome) partnership with Fokker, as the Junkers- Fokker Aktiengesellschaft. Several Junkers designs were licensed to Fokker during this period. The visual similarity of Junkers and Fokker aircraft during the next decade, especially after Reinhold Platz adapted some of the Junkers design concepts, but mostly crafted in wood for the Fokker designs' wing structures instead of the all-metal Junkers construction techniques, is attributable to this early affiliation. The Great War ended with German Navy trials of the model J 11, which was an all-metal floatplane prototype. =Early inter-war period= In the immediate post-war era, Junkers used their J8 layout as the basis for the F-13, first flown on 25 June 1919 and certified airworthy in July of the same year. This four passenger monoplane was the world's first all-metal airliner. Of note, in addition to significant European sales, some twenty-five of these airplanes were delivered to North American customers under the Junkers-Larsen affiliate and were used primarily as airmail planes. The Junkers factory in Dessau, 1928. The Treaty of Versailles signed only days after the F-13 flew, initially forbade any aircraft construction in Germany for several months. After that span of time only the design of civilian aircraft was permitted to Germany. With a partial relocation of the Junkers firm to the Fili western suburb of Moscow, the Junkers firm was able to restart its aircraft manufacturing concern within the borders of the Soviet Union in 1922,Zoeller, Horst (2018) The Hugo Junkers Homepage-Junkers Russian Joint Venture, The Moscow-Fili Production Plant/State Aircraft Factory GAZ No.7 the partly revitalized Junkers firm developed a series of progressively larger civil aircraft including the single-engined G.24 and three-engined G.31. Neither aircraft was a commercial success. With the expiration of treaty restrictions in 1926, Junkers introduced the Junkers W33 and Junkers W34 series which did find significant commercial success via large production orders in passenger, freight hauling, and, somewhat later, military configurations. The W-33/W-34 series also set multiple aviation \\"firsts\\" including records for flight duration, flight distance, altitude, rocket assisted take-off and inflight refueling between 1926 and 1930. Junkers' produced a design study in 1924 for a visit to the United States. The study outlined a four-engined 80-passenger plane, incorporating a forward canard wing, as well as a main wing, both of which were fitted above twin pylons. Called the Junkers J.1000 Super Duck passenger seating was to be provided both in the main wing and the hull sections of the craft. This Junkers design, including a scale model, was intended to illustrate an aircraft capable of trans-Atlantic operations of 8 to 10 hours and was completely revolutionary for its day. It was in 1922 that American engineer William Bushnell Stout, and in 1924 that Soviet engineer Andrei Tupolev each adapted the Junkers corrugated duralumin airframe design technologies for their own initial examples of all-metal aircraft in their respective nations ‚Äì for Stout, the Stout ST twin-engined naval torpedo bomber prototype aircraft, and for Tupolev, the Tupolev ANT-2 small passenger aircraft, who had the assistance of the Soviet government's TsAGI research center in achieving success with light-weight metal airframes. The basic principles outlined in this design were later introduced in the Junkers G.38, which was introduced and put into regular service by Deutsche Luft Hansa. At the time of its introduction, this four-engined transport was the largest landplane in the world carrying thirty-four passengers and seven crew members. The G.38 sat some of its passengers in the wing area outboard of the fuselage, the front of which was covered with windows. Also, in 1932, Junkers joint project with Maybach designed and built an aerodynamic car but found due to the depression that the market for high end luxury cars was saturated.\\"Lockers Hold Spare Wheel Of Stream Line Auto\\", October 1932, Popular Mechanics an auto made in co-operation with Junkers, only one built =Financial troubles= Around 1931 the company suffered from a series of financial difficulties that led to the collapse of the group of companies. The existing shareholders pressured Hugo to leave the company. Hugo, however, was the patent holder on a wide variety of the technologies used in most of the existing Junkers designs, including many of their engines. A plan was started to solve both problems by \\"buying out\\" Hugo's engine patent portfolio and placing it into the hands of a new company, the Junkers Motoren-Patentstelle GmbH, which was eventually formed in November 1932. The new company would then license the technologies back to the various companies, most notably what was then Junkers Motorenbau (one of many \\"Jumo\\" companies). However, before Junkers actually transferred his patents to the Patentstelle, the collapse of the Junkers consortium was solved by the sale of the Junkers Thermo Technik GmbH to Robert Bosch, whose company still uses the brand name. Adolf Dethmann, a Communist activist and friend of Hugo, was appointed managing director. Footnote 35 =Nazi takeover= Share of the Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG, issued October 1937 The Nazi party came to power in Germany in 1933, and all German aviation development was shifted away from long-range civil aircraft types. Hugo Junkers himself was forced to transfer all his patents to the Nazis, who doubted that Junkers (a socialist and pacifist) would comply with their plans. Shortly after, his holdings were expropriated and he was placed under house arrest. The company that had pioneered commercial aviation development for at least a decade was relegated to relatively small one- and two-engined military design competitions issued by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) the \\"Reich Aviation Ministry\\". Two exceptions to this were the Ju 52 and the Ju 90. Ju 52 development had started in 1928 as a single-engined commercial transport and evolved, initially to a two-engined, later into the classic \\"trimotor\\" design for which the Tante Ju became world-famous. The Ju 52 was a bona fide commercial success, with over 400 airplanes delivered to various airlines around the world prior to the outbreak of World War II, including the countries of: Finland, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, South Africa, Denmark, Norway, Italy, UK, Belgium, Hungary, Estonia, Greece, Spain, and of course, Germany. As a consequence of its rugged design, Spain and France resumed Ju 52 production after cessation of the Second World War. With the introduction of the Junkers Ju 86 bomber of 1934, Junkers abandoned the corrugated sheeting of his earlier designs. The basic layout was used in the four-engine Junkers Ju 89 heavy bomber, but this program ended with the death of Walther Wever, and his Ural bomber program along with him. Junkers then adapted the Ju 89 to passenger use, introducing the Junkers Ju 90, one of the first planes specifically designed for scheduled trans-Atlantic flights to the US. Developed in 1937, the aircraft suffered multiple setbacks with crashes of prototypes in 1937 and 1938. Further refinements enabled certification in 1939 and spurred South African Airways to make an initial order for two aircraft fitted with US-built Pratt & Whitney engines. Just as the aircraft was being readied for its first commercial flights, World War II began. With the outbreak of hostilities, all models were requisitioned by the Luftwaffe for military air-transport roles, and later, long-range maritime patrol. =World War II= Military aircraft production was begun by the company in the 1930s and eventually monopolized all its resources. Perhaps the most notable design was the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, one of the Luftwaffe's most effective aerial weapons in the early-war period and continually used for bombing attacks as an integral part of the Blitzkrieg strategy. The Stuka was used both for precision tactical bombing and the strafing of enemy positions, acting as a sort of \\"airborne artillery\\" that was able to keep up with the fast-moving tanks and attack defended points long before traditional artillery could be brought into range. Later in the war it was fitted with two large- calibre, Bordkanone 3,7 37mm underwing autocannon and employed in a \\"tank busting\\" role against Soviet armour. It gained notoriety for its use at both Dunkirk and later Stalingrad, where it caused enormous destruction under Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen's VIII Air Corps. Perhaps even more successful was the Junkers Ju 88, the primary medium bomber of the German forces. It was used in practically every role imaginable; level bomber, shallow-angle dive bomber, night fighter, and bomber destroyer, as well as in anti-shipping raids. A variety of improved versions were also produced over the course of the war, including the Ju 188 and Ju 388 which included numerous features for better performance, but never replaced the Ju 88 outright. A much more formidable aircraft was also planned, the Junkers Ju 288 for the Bomber B design competition, which it handily won ‚Äî but the required high-power engines never worked properly in tests, and as the design was also plagued with insufficiently strong main landing gear, the effort was eventually abandoned. The Ju 52 was a transport aircraft, roughly equivalent to the Allies' DC-3 Dakota, that was also modified to carry out bombing raids. A total of 4,845 Ju 52 were produced before and during World War II, leading to widespread use delivering men and supplies in support of the German war effort. The Ju 52 had previously seen service in the Spanish Civil War, where it took part in the Condor Legion's destructive raids on Durango and Guernica in 1937 which illustrated to the world‚Äîfor the first time‚Äîthe destructive potential and horror of strategic bombing. Unfortunately for its pilots and military passengers, by the outbreak of World War II, the Ju 52 was a thoroughly obsolete military design and unlike many other famous Luftwaffe aircraft, the Tante Ju was cumbersome, slow, and therefore vulnerable to attack. This resulted in many losses, namely at Crete and Stalingrad. The abortive Amerika Bomber design competition for a trans-Atlantic range strategic bomber saw the Junkers firm build two prototypes of its six-engined Junkers Ju 390, basically a stretch of the four-engined Ju 290 transport ‚Äî competing against the trio of Me 264 four-engined prototypes as the only fully airworthy competitors for the contract, which had included designs from Focke-Wulf and Heinkel that were never built, with the competition ended in July 1944 due to the developing need for interceptors to defend the Reich. =Post World War II= The Junkers company survived the Second World War and the formation of East Germany, and was reconstituted as Junkers GmbH and eventually merged into the MBB consortium (via joint venture Flugzeug-Union-S√ºd between Heinkel and Messerschmitt in 1958). Messerschmitt ended the joint venture in 1965 by acquiring control of JFM AG and absorbing it within Messerschmitt in 1967. Within West Germany, Junkers GmbH was engaged in research on the future of aerospace transportation during the fifties and early-1960s. During this period, Junkers employed the famous Austrian engineer and space travel theorist, Eugen S√§nger, who in 1961 completed work for the design of an advanced orbital spacecraft at Junkers. Junkers GmbH was absorbed within MBB and the Junkers name disappeared in 1969. Junkers Jumo Junkers also ran an engine factory, and in 1923 they separated it from the parent to form its own company, Junkers Motorenwerke, or Jumo. This company expanded greatly in the 1920s and 30s, with factories spread across Germany. Jumo was the first company to produce a successful aircraft diesel engine in material numbers, the opposed-piston layout two stroke Jumo 205, and it was the first German company to offer a truly modern engine suitable for aviation in the form of the 650 hp, inverted-V12 Jumo 210. But, with the rapid advances in airframes, after a few years this engine was considered to be underpowered, causing Jumo to respond with the much larger Jumo 211, the most-produced German aviation engine of any type during the war years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 211 saw widespread use in Junkers bombers ‚Äî most often in a \\"unitized\\" form for the Junkers Ju 88A, and also in the competing Heinkel He 111H medium bomber ‚Äî but was little used otherwise, due largely to the better power output of the competing Daimler-Benz DB 601. Further development of the 211 led to the superb Jumo 213, which was in high demand for an increasingly large variety of late-war piston-engined aircraft. Their only attempt at an over-1,500 kW output piston engine, the Junkers Jumo 222, suffered from inadequate metallurgy and internal design for what was otherwise a very innovative engine design, with nearly 300 examples produced solely as test examples ‚Äî the aviation engine firms of the Third Reich had considerable challenges in developing piston engines that could exceed the 1,500 kW output level that would be able to operate with proven combat reliability. However, the world's first production axial-flow compressor-equipped turbojet engine, emerged from the \\"Jumo\\" firm in 1944 as the Jumo 004, becoming the first turbojet engine to be considered of production quality, and was used in the then revolutionary Messerschmitt Me 262A jet fighter. Products =Aircraft= The Junkers firm's early aircraft were identified by the letter J for Junkers followed by an Arabic type number. From 1919 they introduced an additional sales designation using the same number but prefixed by a letter indicating the role of the aircraft: :A = Austauschflugzeug (suitable for either civil or military use) :EF = Entwurfsflugzeug (experimental aircraft) :F = Flugzeug (aircraft) :G = Gro√üflugzeug (large aircraft) :H = aircraft built at Junkers' Moscow plant :K = Kampfflugzeug (bomber) :S = Spezial (special) :T = Schulflugzeug (trainer aircraft) :W = Wasserflugzeug (seaplane). Just once, the same number was used to identify two different completed types. This pair was the T 23 and G23, both also known as J 23. During World War I, machines in service used the regular Idflieg aircraft designation system to specify their design's purpose, also promoted by the Flugzeugmeisterei (Air Ministry), again a letter number system indicating role: :CL = two-seat ground attack :D = single-seat biplane scout, by 1918 used for all single seat scouts. :E = single-seat monoplane scout :J = two-seat armoured close support biplane. The best known and most confusing example is the Junkers J 4 armored-fuselage, all-metal sesquiplane, known to the military as the Junkers J.I. The single letter company prefix was not replaced by the twin-letter Ju prefix until 1933. This RLM system ‚Äì from the Third Reich's air ministry ‚Äì applied to all German manufacturers; the first Junkers aircraft to receive a Ju number was the W 33, so retrospectively it became the Ju 33.Kay, p. 134 However, earlier aircraft built in Moscow like the H 21 were often described by a Ju number, e.g. Ju 21.Kay, p. 44 J.I is at the Canada Aviation Museum. * Junkers J 1, (no military designation) world's first-ever full metal-structure aircraft, 1915. * Junkers J 2, (no military designation) experimental all-metal single seater, designed as fighter, 1916. * Junkers J 3, mid-wing monoplane, cancelled before completion, first proposed corrugated-skin duralumin design. * Junkers J 4, (military J.I) armored- fuselage sesquiplane full metal close support aircraft, 1917 * Junkers J 5, unbuilt monoplane scout with engine behind pilot. * Junkers J 6, unbuilt parasol monoplane scout. * Junkers J 7, prototype for J 9, 1917. * Junkers J 8, twin-seat development of J 7, 1917. * Junkers J 9, (military D.I) all- duralumin single-seat fighter, built in J.9/I and J.9/II (lengthened wingspan and rear fuselage) versions, 1918. * Junkers J 10, (military CL.I) all- duralumin monoplane close support aircraft, 1918. * Junkers J 11, (navy C3MG, military CLS.I) floatplane version of J 10, 1918. * Junkers J 12, prototype four-seat airliner developed from the J 10, precursor of F.13, 1919. * Junkers F 13, passenger plane, 1919 originally J 13, sold as Junkers-Larsen in US, 1919. * Junkers JG1, large monoplane project, 1921. * Junkers J 15, precursor of J/K 16, 1920 * Junkers K 16, small single-engined passenger plane, alternatively known as J 16, 1922. * Junkers J 17, improved K 16, not built. * Junkers J 18, navy survey aircraft, not built. * Junkers T 19, trainer and tourer, alternately known as J 19, 1922. * Junkers A 20, light transport, 1923. * Junkers J 21, also known as T 21 and H 21, reconnaissance aircraft for Red Army built in Russia, 1923. * Junkers J 22, also known as H 22, for Red Army, fighter similar to J 21, 1922. * Junkers T 23, sports mono- or biplane, 1923. * Junkers G 23, 3-engined 10-seat airliner, 1923. * Junkers G 24, enlarged G 23, 1925. * Junkers F 24, single-engined development of G 23, 1928. * Junkers A 25, A 20s re-engined with Junkers L2 engines, 1926. * Junkers T 26, training and sports aircraft, 1925. * Junkers T 27, a re-engined T 26, 1925. * Junkers J 28, two-seat version of T.21, not built. * Junkers J 29, sports monoplane, double wing development aircraft, 1925. * Junkers K 30, military version of G 24, 1930. * Junkers G 31, 15 seat airliner, 1926. * Junkers A 32, experimental monoplane, 1926. * Junkers W 33, single-engined light transport, (developed from F.13) 1926.

It was intended to provide an alternative to Nicholaus Otto's patented four stroke which would run on low grade fuels such as blast furnace waste gases. By 1896 Junkers engines were generating electrical power in steelworks.Kay, p. 11; 257‚Äì278 * Junkers Fo2, horizontal, petrol, c.1923. * Junkers L1, petrol, c. 1924. * Junkers L2, petrol, 1925. * Junkers L5, enlarged L 2, petrol, 1925. * Junkers Fo3, diesel, 1926. * Junkers L55, \\"double L5\\" (V12), petrol, 1927 * Junkers L7, small version of L2, petrol; not flown. * Junkers Fo4, diesel, commercially called the Junkers SL1, 1928. * Junkers L8, petrol, geared, higher power development of L5, 1929. * Junkers L88, \\"double L8\\" (V12), petrol. * Jumo 204, development of the SL1, initially referred to as the Jumo 4, 1930. * Jumo 205, diesel, reduced displacement version of the Jumo 204, initially known as the Jumo 5, 1933. * Jumo 206, diesel, higher power version of 205, 1936. * Jumo 207, diesel, supercharged version of 205, 1939. * Jumo 208, diesel, c.1940 * Jumo 209, diesel, unbuilt development of 207/208 * Jumo 210, initially known as L10, petrol inverted V12, c. 1932. * Jumo 211, petrol, inverted V12, enlarged variant of 210, 1936. * Jumo 212, petrol, projected inverted V24 with two Jumo 211 engines. * Jumo 213, petrol, inverted V12, smaller version of 211, 1940. * Jumo 218, diesel, unbuilt 12 cylinder version with two 208 engines. * Jumo 222, petrol, 24-cylinder, 6-bank radial, 1939. * Jumo 223, diesel, experimental 24 cylinder with four 207 engines arranged in a box shape. * Jumo 224, diesel, higher power version of 223, development continued in the Soviet Union. * Jumo 225, petrol, projected 36-cylinder, multi-bank radial developed from the 222. * Junkers 109-004, turbojet, 1940. * Junkers 109-012, turbojet, few completed by Soviets, 1946. * Junkers 109-022, turboprop, project completed by Soviets, 1950.

Born in the United States to Japanese parents, record producer Utada Teruzane and singer Keiko Fuji, Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name Cubic U, Utada released her English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B; and dance-pop, her Japanese- language debut First Love was released and became an instant success. Backed by the massive success of singles \\"Automatic\\", \\"Time Will Tell\\", and \\"Movin' On Without You\\", the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the Oricon charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. First Love eventually became the country's best-selling album of all time. Her following album Distance was released in early 2001 and spawned Utada's biggest hit singles‚Äî\\"Addicted to You\\", \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\" and \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\"‚Äîwhich became million- sellers. The album was commercially successful and broke several sales records after three million copies were sold in its first week of availability in Japan, instantly becoming the country's fastest-selling album. In 2002, backed by chart-topping singles such as \\"Traveling\\", \\"Hikari\\" and \\"Sakura Drops\\", Deep River, which incorporates elements of pop folk, was released and went on to become one of Japan's top-selling records of all-time. Subsequent full- length releases‚ÄîExodus, Ultra Blue and Heart Station‚Äîachieved million-selling status certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. After a prolonged hiatus, Utada released acoustic-driven Fant√¥me and Hatsukoi, which reached number-one on the Oricon album charts. By the end of the 2000s, Utada was deemed \\"the most influential artist of the decade\\" in the Japanese music landscape by The Japan Times. Utada's commercial success has made her one of Japan's top-selling recording artists of all time with over 37 million records sold since launching her career in the late 1990s. Twelve of her singles have reached number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, while ten of her albums have become chart-toppers. Six of her full-length releases are among the country's highest-selling albums of all time, including First Love, Distance and Deep River, which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history. Additionally, Utada is best known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-song contributions to Square Enix and Disney's collaborative video game series Kingdom Hearts: \\"Simple and Clean\\", \\"Sanctuary\\", \\"Don't Think Twice\\" and \\"Face My Fears\\". Career =Early life and beginnings= Utada was born in New York City as the only child of Teruzane, a Japanese record producer, and his wife Junko, an singer, performing under the stage name Keiko Fuji. At the age of 10, Utada began to write music and lyrics. She did her recordings with her mother, releasing songs under a band named \\"U3\\" (also known as Utada 3) until 1996 when she started her first solo project, \\"I'll be Stronger\\", The \\"Cookin' with Moses Vocal\\" from this project was called the \\"Cookin' with Gas Vocal\\" on the promotional release. \\"I'll Be Stronger\\" was released under the artist name Cubic U, a mathematical reference to her being the third Utada \\"power\\", and was her pseudonym before becoming a superstar in Japan; the song was not released in the United States. In 1997, she started her next project, though at first she was hesitant. Cubic U released her debut single \\"Close to You\\", which was a cover of The Carpenters' song. She then released her debut album Precious the following year. Both the album and single failed to chart on the Oricon charts. =1998‚Äì2003: Japanese debut, First Love, Distance, and Deep River= Utada moved to Tokyo in the summer of 1998 and attended Seisen International School, and later the American School in Japan, while continuing to record on a new contract with Toshiba-EMI. Her movement originally came from Japanese FM radio. She opted for becoming a singer-songwriter instead of attempting to become an idol. Leading up to the release of her Japanese debut album First Love, at the age of 16, Utada released two successful million- selling singles: \\"Automatic/Time Will Tell\\" and \\"Movin' On Without You\\". \\"Automatic/Time Will Tell\\" sold over two million copies. Backed by her singles, her debut album First Love went on to sell over 7 million units in Japan alone (with an additional 3 million overseas, bringing it to a sum of at least 10 million units), becoming the highest selling album in Japan's recent history. The album yielded the single \\"First Love\\", which peaked at the #2 spot. By the end of the year, Utada was rank number 5 on a Japanese radio station Tokio Hot 100 Airplay's Top 100 Artists of the 20th Century by the station and its listeners. After a two-year break, Utada released her follow- up album Distance, garnering a first-week sales of 3 million units sold. Backed by her singles ‚Äì \\"Addicted to You\\", \\"Wait & See (Risk)\\", \\"For You\\" / \\"Time Limit\\" and \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" ‚Äì Distance became the best-selling album of the year, with 4.469 million copies sold in Japan alone. Additionally, \\"Addicted to You\\" became Utada's best-selling single, selling one-million in its first week which became the highest first week sales for a female solo artist and staying on top of the chart for two consecutive weeks. \\"Wait & See: Risk\\" and \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" also were later ranked at #6 and #10 respectively on Oricon's list of 10 Best-Selling Singles from January 1, 1999 to April 24, 2006. Utada also went on to release a single which was dedicated to the female victim of a murder case in Ikeda, Osaka, titled \\"Final Distance\\". In 2001, Utada recorded the song \\"Blow My Whistle\\" for the action- comedy film Rush Hour 2. It was a collaboration with American rapper Foxy Brown, and was written by Utada alongside Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. The song is included on Def Jam's Rush Hour 2 soundtrack, which peaked the 11th spot on both the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the Top Soundtracks. Although Utada usually produces her own songs, Blow My Whistle was produced by The Neptunes. Leading to her third album, Utada released \\"Traveling\\", \\"Hikari\\", and \\"Sakura Drops/Letters\\"; all the songs reached the top of the charts. Before the release of Utada's third album, Deep River, Utada underwent surgery after being diagnosed with a benign ovarian tumor, causing Utada to put her promotional activities on hold. After recovering, she released Deep River and immediately went on promotional tours. While there were no TV appearances, she promoted her album in magazine and radio interviews. Deep River sold 2.35 million copies on its first-week sale. Oricon reported that sales eventually surpassed 3.60 million, making Utada the only singer or group in Japanese music history to have three consecutive albums surpass the three million mark, by RIAJ standards. It was her third consecutive time to hold the #1 position on Oricon's Yearly Albums chart and became the eighth best selling album of all time in Japan. In 2003, Utada's promotional and personal life schedules became more active due to her marriage and an imposing agreement with Island Records in the United States to release a \\"proper\\" full-English debut album. Though she released \\"Colors\\", it was her only single release for 2003. The song featured experimental tones for the first time in Utada's discography. It became her longest charting single ever with a 45-week trajectory on the Oricon Singles chart, selling 881,000 copies, and was #3 on the Yearly Singles chart. =2004‚Äì05: Foray into international market, and Exodus= Utada Hikaru in 2004 Her first singles compilation album Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 was released on March 31, 2004. It became the best-selling album of 2004 in Japan, making her the only solo or group artist to reach #1 four times on the yearly charts. It was the first compilation album to reach #1 in six years on the yearly charts, and the first compilation album to reach #1 in twenty-six years by a female artist. Despite its success, the album received little promotion and no new material; moreover, it charted longer on the Oricon Albums chart longer than any other Utada release to date (over two years). The album sold over 2.575 million units in Japan, making it the 34th best-selling album ever in the country. A month later, on April 21, she released her only Japanese single in 2004, \\"Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro\\", which topped the singles chart for two consecutive weeks and sold 365,000 units by the year's end and was also the main theme song for Casshern, directed by her then husband Kazuaki Kiriya. In mid-2004, Utada moved back to New York, and began work on a new recording contract with Island Def Jam Music Group. On October 5, 2004, she released her North American English-language debut album, Exodus, under the name \\"Utada\\", which was her new American-given artist title at the Universal Convention. It was released on September 9 in Japan, with a special booklet and housed in a cardboard slipcase. In an MTV interview, Utada expressed skepticism about her American success: \\"I don't think it's the music that I'm concerned about. It's obviously that I look really different and there really aren't any completely Asian people [who are popular singers in the U.S.] right now.\\" She also remarked that it was the album she'd always wanted to make, and one that wasn't pandering to her usual fans. Exodus became Utada's fourth consecutive release to debut at #1 and boast 500,000 copies in its first-week sales in Japan. American sales were not as successful, it reached #160 in the US Billboard 200 chart; it however peaked at #5 in the Heatseekers chart. \\"Easy Breezy\\" was released as the lead single in early August 2004, followed up by \\"Devil Inside\\" a month and two weeks later. Utada then became the cover of the Interview magazine June 2005 issue. \\"Exodus '04\\" was released at the end of June 2005 and featured remixes from The Scumfrog, Richard Vission, JJ Flores and Peter Bailey. In the UK, Mercury added another two remixes for \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" in the original album, titled \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man (Bloodshy & Avant Mix)\\" and \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man (Junior Jack Mix)\\". By the end of the year, Utada was voted \\"Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2004\\" by Oricon's annual readers poll. The fourth single from Exodus, \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\", was released in October 2005 in the UK. \\"Devil Inside\\" became a club hit in the U.S. and topped the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay charts. Both the Exodus album and the \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" single were released in the UK, with different artwork from the US and Japanese versions. =2005‚Äì08: Return to Japan, Ultra Blue, and Heart Station= A year after the release of Exodus, Utada moved back to Tokyo and returned to the Japanese music scene. Leading up the release of her fourth album, Ultra Blue, Utada released a string of successful hit singles: \\"Colors\\" (#1), \\"Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro\\" (#1), \\"Be My Last\\" (# 1), \\"Passion\\" (#4), and \\"Keep Tryin'\\" (#2). The digital single \\"This Is Love\\" was released to promote the album, netting 1,000,000 digital downloads. Utada performing during her Utada United 2006 tour Ultra Blue sold 500,317 copies in the first week, lower than that of the previous album, although it still topped the Oricon Daily, Weekly, and Monthly charts. Ultra Blue gave the artist her fifth consecutive chart-topping Japanese album (excluding her English album) to sell in excess of 500,000 copies for a first- week sales. On July 13, Toshiba EMI published a report stating that Ultra Blue had sold over one million copies worldwide and four million digital ringtones already making it one of EMI's 10th best-selling album of the past year. The album, which did not contain much pop music, was met with mixed reception and did not boost sales, although the album was certified Million by RIAJ for one million shipments. Additionally, it was the highest-selling original studio album by a Japanese female artist in 2006. Ultra Blue later became available on the iTunes Japan online music store, charting at #4 on the 2006 yearly download rankings. Two weeks after the release of Ultra Blue, Utada began a nationwide tour titled Utada United 2006 on June 30, 2006 which ended on September 12, 2006. This was Utada's second concert tour after her debut tour Bohemian Summer 2000 and five performances at the Nippon Budokan in 2004. Aside from her Japanese work, the tour's set list featured three tracks from her 2004 English-language album, Exodus. The singles that were released prior to Utada's fifth studio album, Heart Station, were able to reach the Top Five position on the chart, including the #1 hit \\"Flavor of Life\\", which would become the best selling digital single in Japan with over 7,500,000 copies download. Around the same time, Utada said she visited New York to talk with producers and executives at Island/Def Jam about recording a new English album. Later in the year a digital track by American R&B; artist Ne-Yo, titled \\"Do You\\" from his 2007 album Because of You, featured Utada and was released in Japan on November 21 (the song was later featured on Ne-Yo's \\"best of\\" album, Ne-Yo: The Collection, released on September 2, 2009 in Japan and November 2009 in the US). On June 30, 2007, the British EMI Group, which had held a 55% stake in Toshiba EMI since before Utada's debut in Japan, purchased the remaining 45% stake from the Japanese Toshiba Corporation, therefore making Toshiba EMI a wholly owned subsidiary of the London-based record label. Toshiba EMI then changed its name to EMI Music Japan to reflect Toshiba's divestiture from the business. Utada's first single under the new label, \\"Beautiful World\\"/\\"Kiss & Cry\\" was released as a double A-side single on August 29, 2007, and also reached #1 on the Oricon Daily Chart. Beautiful World was used as the theme song for Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone, the 2007 film reboot of the anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, while Kiss & Cry was used in a series of commercials for Nissin Foods' Freedom Project advertising campaign starting April 20, 2007 and was previously released as a digital download on May 31, 2007. The year 2007 ended with the single \\"Flavor of Life\\" becoming the best seller of 2007 and with Utada being voted \\"Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2007\\" by Oricon's annual readers poll, three years after she was last voted #1 on the poll. She sold 12 million digital ringtones and songs in 2007, the highest of a Japanese artist in one year. The single was featured as the main song in second season of TV drama Hana Yori Dango. Utada's fifth studio album, Heart Station, was released on March 19, 2008, becoming her fifth consecutive number-one Japanese studio album. Although it had collected the lowest first week sales for Utada's career, with 480,081 copies sold, the sales of this album reached a million on the Oricon charts in January 2009, making it her first Japanese album to do so since her 2004 compilation album. It was given a certification of one million for shipments by the RIAJ. Heart Station became the best-selling digital-format album on the iTunes 2008 yearly album charts in Japan, and was also the highest-selling original studio album by a solo female artist on the Oricon Yearly Chart. Her song \\"Prisoner of Love\\" was used as the theme-song for the television drama Last Friends. Although \\"Prisoner of Love\\" was not initially released as a single alone, it reached number 1 in iTunes and the Chako-Uta charts after it was released as a single for the drama. It reached number 2 at the Oricon Weekly charts. It won Best Theme Song at the 57th Drama Academy Awards and sold 2.9 million downloads. It marked the fourth successful Utada drama tie-in (following 1999's Majo no J≈çken and First Love, 2001's Hero and Can You Keep a Secret and 2007's Hana Yori Dango and Flavor of Life). On October 20, 2008, her song \\"Eternally\\" from her 2001 album Distance was used as the theme for the drama Innocent Love. The song was later released as a digital single. By the end of the year, Utada was also voted the \\"Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2008\\" by Oricon's annual readers poll, making it her second consecutive year, and third time overall, to win the vote; her previous years being 2004 and 2007. =2009‚Äì10: Return to the US, and This Is the One= Utada in 2009 On December 16, 2008, information leaked onto the internet that Utada's next English- language single, titled \\"Come Back to Me\\", would be scheduled for airplay release through U.S. Rhythmic/Crossover and Mainstream formats on February 9 and 10, 2009 respectively via Island Records. The new English album, titled This Is the One, was released on March 14, 2009 in Japan and on May 12, 2009 in the United States. This Is the One debuted at #1 in Japan on March 13, 2009, the day it was released in Japan, but became Utada's first album not to top the weekly chart since Precious. On March 30, 2009 she appeared on New York City radio station Z-100 (100.3), the largest pop radio program in the U.S., and granted a live on-air interview on the station's Elvis Duran Morning Show, a breakthrough that would lead to a promotional schedule up and through the album's international physical release on May 12.

It was issued jointly by Vancouver Island and British Columbia as each colony had insufficient postal trade to justify printing separate stamps. In 1862, Vancouver Island adopted decimal currency and sold the stamp for 5 cents, before issuing its own 5 and 10 cent stamps in September 1865. Meanwhile, British Columbia had increased the postal rate to 3 pence but continued to use the unified stamp. In November 1865, British Columbia issued its own stamps and the unified stamp became invalid. In 1866, the two colonies were united as British Columbia. Colonies An 1865 stamp of British Columbia In 1860, the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia issued a postage stamp inscribed with the names of both British Columbia and Vancouver Island. The British Colony of Vancouver Island (also known as Vancouver's Island) was established in 1849, after the Hudson's Bay Company founded Fort Camosack (later Fort Victoria) in 1843. The Fraser River Gold Rush of 1858 caused an influx of settlers to the mainland, via Vancouver Island, and after this, British Columbia was made a new colony on the mainland. In 1866, the two colonies were united as British Columbia and, in 1871, this became a province of Canada.Rossiter and Flower, p.131. Stamp details 5c stamp issued by Vancouver Island in 1865 The unified stamp was issued for reasons of economy, both colonies having sufficient customers to justify the printing of stamps, but not enough to justify separate issues for each colony. The one stamp was denominated 2¬Ω pence, depicting Queen Victoria in profile, and was surface-printed in a brownish-rose color by De La Rue. 235,440 were printed. In 1862, Vancouver Island switched to decimal currency, and sold the unified stamp for 5 cents. It first issued its own 5- and 10-cent stamps in September 1865. In June 1864, British Columbia increased its postal rate to 3 pence, selling the unified stamp for 3d until its own stamps became available in November 1865. Pairs of stamps, used to pay a special rate to Vancouver Island, were also sold at 15 cents per pair. Although after 1865, the 2¬Ωd stamp was officially invalid, in 1867 some were made available at a 6¬º cent rate to express mail operators. The upshot of all this was the single type of stamp was sold for 2¬Ωd, 3d, 5c, 6¬ºc, and 7¬Ωc without ever receiving a surcharge indicating a changed value. The surviving unified stamps sell for about US$250 , but much more if they are in good condition and well-centered.

With the creation of the House of Burgesses in 1642, the General Assembly, which had been established in 1619, became a bicameral institution. From 1642 to 1776, the House of Burgesses was an instrument of government alongside the royally- appointed colonial governor and the upper-house Council of State in the General Assembly. When the Virginia colony declared its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain at the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776 and became the independent Commonwealth of Virginia, the House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates, which continues to serve as the lower house of the General Assembly. Name Originally a synonym of burgher or bourgeois, the word \\"Burgess\\" came to mean a borough representative in local or parliamentary government. Early years The Colony of Virginia was founded by an English stock company, the Virginia Company, as a private venture, though under a royal charter. Early governors provided the stern leadership and harsh judgments required for the colony to survive its early difficulties. Early crises with famine, disease, Native American attempts to retake land, the need to establish cash crops, and lack of skilled or committed labor, meant the colony needed to attract enough new and responsible settlers if it were to grow and prosper. To encourage settlers to come to Virginia, in November 1618 the Virginia Company's leaders gave instructions to the new governor, Sir George Yeardley, which became known as \\"the great charter.\\" Emigrants who paid their own way to Virginia would receive fifty acres of land and not be mere tenants. Civil authority would control the military. In 1619, based on the instructions, Governor Yeardley initiated the election of 22 burgesses by the settlements and Jamestown. They, together with the royally-appointed Governor and six-member Council of State, would form the first General Assembly as a unicameral body. The governor could veto its actions and the Company still maintained overall control of the venture, but the settlers would have a limited say in the management of their own affairs, including their finances.Rubin, Jr. Louis D. Virginia: A History. New York W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1977; . pp. 3‚Äì27. A House of Assembly was created at the same time in Bermuda (which had also been settled by the Virginia Company, and was by then managed by its offshoot, the Somers Isles Company) and held its first session in 1620. A handful of Polish craftsmen, brought to the colony to supply skill in the manufacture of pitch, tar, potash, and soap ash, were initially denied the political rights of English settlers. They downed tools in protest, but returned to work after being declared free (probably in the sense of civil liberty) and enfranchised, apparently by agreement with the Virginia Company. =First session= On July 30, 1619, Governor Yeardley convened the General Assembly as the first representative legislature in the Americas for a six-day meeting at the new brick church on Jamestown Island, Virginia. The unicameral Assembly was composed of the Governor, a Council of State appointed by the Virginia Company and the 22 locally elected representatives.Bosher, Kate Langley.

The Assembly's first session of July 30, 1619, was cut short by an outbreak of malaria and adjourned after five days.Henry, William Wirt. The First Legislative Assembly in America.

On the third day of the assembly, the assembly's Journal noted \\"Mr. Shelley, one of the Burgesses, deceased.\\"Henry, 1894, p. 61. Twenty-two (22) members were sent to the assembly from the following constituencies: From James City: (Captain William Powell, Ensign William Spence of Spence); From Charles City: (Samuel Sharpe, Samuel Jordan); From the City of Henricus: (Thomas Dowse, John Pollington sometimes shown as Polentine or similar variations); From Kecoughtan: (Captain William Tucker, William Capps); From Smythe's Hundred (Captain Thomas Graves, Walter Shelley); From Martin's Hundred (John Boys, John Jackson); From Argall's Gift Plantation (Thomas Pawlett, Edward Gourgainy); From Flowerdew (or Flowerdieu) Hundred Plantation: (Ensign Edmund Rossingham, John Jefferson (burgess); From Captain Lawne's Plantation: (Captain Christopher Lawne, Ensign Washer); From Captain Ward's Plantation: (Captain John Warde or Ward, Lieutenant John Gibbs or Gibbes); and From Martin-Brandon (Captain John Martin's Plantation): (Thomas Davis, Robert Stacy).Stanard, William G. and Mary Newton Stanard. The Virginia Colonial Register. Albany, NY: Joel Munsell's Sons Publishers, 1902. , Retrieved July 15, 2011. p. 52. Two of the members, Thomas Davis and Robert Stacy, were excluded from the assembly because John Martin refused to give up a clause in his land patent that exempted his borough \\"from any command of the colony except it be aiding and assisting the same against any foreign or domestic enemy.\\"Stanard, Mary Newton The Real Beginning of American Democracy: The Virginia Assembly of 1619.

By 1624, the royal government in London had heard enough about the problems of the colony and revoked the charter of the Virginia Company. Virginia became a crown colony and the governor and council would be appointed by the king. Nonetheless, the Assembly maintained management of local affairs with some informal royal assent, although it was not royally confirmed until 1639. In 1634, the General Assembly divided the colony into eight shires (later renamed counties) for purposes of government, administration, and the judicial system. By 1643, the expanding colony had 15 counties. All of the county offices, including a board of commissioners, judges, sheriff, constable and clerks, were appointed positions. Only the burgesses were elected by a vote of the people. Women had no right to vote. Only free and white men originally were given the right to vote, by 1670 only property owners were allowed to vote. In 1642, Governor William Berkeley urged creation of a bicameral legislature, which the Assembly promptly implemented; the House of Burgesses was thus formed and met separately from the Council of State. In 1652, the parliamentary forces of Oliver Cromwell forced the colony to submit to being taken over by the English government. Again, the colonists were able to retain the General Assembly as their governing body. Only taxes agreed to by the assembly were to be levied. Still, most Virginia colonists were loyal to Prince Charles, and were pleased at his restoration as King Charles II in 1660. He went on directly or indirectly to restrict some of the liberties of the colonists, such as requiring tobacco to be shipped only to England, only on English ships, with the price set by the English merchant buyers;Rubin, 1977, p. 19. but the General Assembly remained. A majority of the members of the General Assembly of 1676 were supporters of Nathaniel Bacon. They enacted legislation designed to further popular sovereignty and representative government and to equalize opportunities.Rubin, 1977, p. 25. Bacon took little part in the deliberations since he was busy fighting the Native Americans.Rubin, 1977, p. 26. The statehouse in Jamestown burned down for the fourth time on October 20, 1698. The General Assembly met temporarily in Middle Plantation, inland from Jamestown, and then in 1699 permanently moved the capital of the colony to Middle Plantation, which they renamed Williamsburg.Rubin, 1977. p. 29. Moving toward independence Second Capitol at Williamsburg (viewed from Duke of Gloucester Street) Though not a unique occurrence on the frontier, colonists remained loyal to the British crown during the French and Indian War in North America from 1754 to 1763. The conflict, which somewhat uniquely began in the Ohio Valley and spread to Europe, resulted in local colonial losses and economic disruption. Higher taxes were to follow, and adverse local reactions to these and how they were determined would drive events well into the next decade. In 1764, desiring revenue from its North American colonies, Parliament passed the first law specifically aimed at raising colonial money for the Crown. The Sugar Act increased duties on non-British goods shipped to the colonies. The same year, the Currency Act prohibited American colonies from issuing their own currency. These angered many American colonists and began colonial opposition with protests. By the end of the year, many colonies were practicing non- importation, a refusal to use imported English goods. In 1765, the British Quartering Act, which required the colonies to provide barracks and supplies to British troops, further angered American colonists; and to raise more money for Britain, Parliament enacted the Stamp Act on the American colonies, to tax newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, broadsides, legal documents, dice, and playing cards. American colonists responded to Parliament's acts with organized protest throughout the colonies. A network of secret organizations known as the Sons of Liberty was created to intimidate the stamp agents collecting the taxes, and before the Stamp Act could take effect, all the appointed stamp agents in the colonies had resigned. The Massachusetts Assembly suggested a meeting of all colonies to work for the repeal of the Stamp Act, and all but four colonies were represented. The colonists also increased their non-importation efforts,America During the Age of Revolution, 1764‚Äì1765, Library of Congress and sought to increase in local production. In May 1765, Patrick Henry presented a series of resolves that became known as the Virginia Resolves, denouncing the Stamp Act and denying the authority of the British parliament to tax the colonies, since they were not represented by elected members of parliament. Newspapers around the colonies published all his resolves, even the most radical ones which had not been passed by the assembly.Wood, 2002, p.14 The assembly also sent a 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance to Parliament. From 1769 -1775 Thomas Jefferson represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He pursued reforms to slavery and introduced legislation allowing masters to take control over the emancipation of slaves in 1769, taking discretion away from the royal Governor and General Court. Jefferson persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation's passage, but reaction was strongly negative.Meacham, 2012, pp. 47‚Äì49 In 1769 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed several resolutions condemning Britain's stationing troops in Boston following the Massachusetts Circular Letter of the previous year; these resolutions stated that only Virginia's governor and legislature could tax its citizens. The members also drafted a formal letter to the King, completing it just before the legislature was dissolved by Virginia's royal governor.America During the Age of Revolution, 1768‚Äì1769, Library of Congress In 1774, after Parliament passed the Boston Port Act to close Boston Harbor, the House of Burgesses adopted resolutions in support of the Boston colonists which resulted in Virginia's royal governor, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, dissolving the assembly. The burgesses then reassembled on their own and issued calls for the first of five Virginia Conventions. These conventions were essentially meetings of the House of Burgesses without the governor and Council, Peyton Randolph the Speaker of the House would serve as the President of the convention, and they would elect delegates to the Continental Congress. The First Continental Congress passed their Declaration and Resolves, which inter alia claimed that American colonists were equal to all other British citizens, protested against taxation without representation, and stated that Britain could not tax the colonists since they were not represented in Parliament. In 1775 the burgesses, meeting in conventions, listened to Patrick Henry deliver his \\"give me liberty or give me death\\" speech and raised regiments. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg to take his place as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not been sent to the Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress. The burgesses formed a Committee of Safety to take over governance in the absence of the royal governor, Dunmore, who had organized loyalists forces but after defeats he took refuge on a British warship. In 1776 the House of Burgesses ended. The final entry in the Journals of the House of Burgesses is \\"6th of May. 16 Geo. III. 1776 ‚Ä¶ FINIS.\\" Edmund Pendleton, a member of the House of Burgesses (and President of the Committee of Safety) who was present at the final meeting, wrote in a letter to Richard Henry Lee on the following day, \\"We met in assembly yesterday, and determined not to adjourn, but let that body die.\\" Later on the same morning, the members of the fifth and final Virginia Revolutionary Convention met in the chamber of the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg and elected Pendleton its president. The convention voted for independence from Britain. The former colony had become the independent Commonwealth of Virginia and the convention created the Constitution of Virginia with a new General Assembly, composed of an elected Senate and an elected House of Delegates. The House of Delegates acceded to the role of the former House of Burgesses. Meeting places In 1619, the General Assembly first met in the church in Jamestown. Subsequent meetings continued to take place in Jamestown. In 1700, the seat of the House of Burgesses was moved from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, near what was soon renamed Williamsburg. The Burgesses met there, first (1700 to 1704) in the Great Hall of what is now called the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary, while the Capitol was under construction. When the Capitol burned in 1747, the legislature moved back into the college until the second Capitol was completed in 1754. The present Capitol building at Colonial Williamsburg is a reconstruction of the earlier of the two lost buildings. In 1779, and effective in April 1780, the House of Delegates moved the capital city to Richmond during the American Revolutionary War for safety reasons. Legacy The House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates in 1776, retaining its status as the lower house of the General Assembly, the legislative branch of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Through the General Assembly and House of Burgesses, the Virginia House of Delegates is considered the oldest continuous legislative body in the New World. In honor of the original House of Burgesses, every four years, the Virginia General Assembly traditionally leaves the current Capitol in Richmond, and meets for one day in the restored Capitol building at Colonial Williamsburg. The most recent commemorative session (the 26th) was held in January 2016. In January 2007, the Assembly held a special session at Jamestown to mark the 400th anniversary of its founding as part of the Jamestown 2007 celebration, including an address by then-Vice-President Dick Cheney. In January 2019, to mark the 400th anniversary of the House of Burgesses, the Virginia House of Representatives Clerk's Office announced a new Database of House Members called \\"DOME\\" that \\"[chronicles] the 9,700-plus men and women who served as burgesses or delegates in the Virginia General Assembly over the past four centuries.\\" See also *List of members of the Virginia House of Burgesses *List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Burgesses *Virginia Slave Codes of 1705 References Bibliography Further reading * Hatch, Charles E., Jr., (1956 rev).

It was founded in 1908 by Alexander Cameron Rutherford,\\"A Gentleman of Strathcona ‚Äì Alexander Cameron Rutherford\\", Douglas R. Babcock, 1989, The University of Calgary Press, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the first premier of Alberta, and Henry Marshall Tory,\\"Henry Marshall Tory, A Biography\\", originally published 1954, current edition January 1992, E.A. Corbett, Toronto: Ryerson Press, its first president. Its enabling legislation is the Post-secondary Learning Act. The university is considered a \\"Comprehensive academic and research university\\" (CARU), which means that it offers a range of academic and professional programs, which generally lead to undergraduate and graduate level credentials, and have a strong research focus. The university comprises four campuses in Edmonton, the Augustana Campus in Camrose, and a staff centre in downtown Calgary. The original north campus consists of 150 buildings covering 50 city blocks on the south rim of the North Saskatchewan River valley, directly across from downtown Edmonton. 39,000 students from Canada and 150 other countries participate in 400 programs in 18 faculties. The University of Alberta is a major economic driver in Alberta. The university's impact on the Alberta economy is an estimated $12.3 billion annually, or five per cent of the province's gross domestic product. The University of Alberta is also a leading institution for the study of Ukraine and is home to the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. The University of Alberta has graduated more than 275,000 alumni, including Governor General Roland Michener; Prime Minister Joe Clark; Chief Justice of Canada Beverley McLachlin; Alberta premiers Peter Lougheed, Dave Hancock, Jim Prentice and Rachel Notley; Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson and Nobel laureate Richard E. Taylor. The university is a member of the Alberta Rural Development Network, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System. History Old Arts Building, University of Alberta campus, designed by Percy Erskine Nobbs & Frank Darling 1909‚Äì10. Rutherford House, on the northeast corner of the University of Alberta campus. alt= The University of Alberta, a single, public provincial university, was chartered in 1906 in Edmonton, Alberta with the University Act in the first session of the new Legislative Assembly, with Premier Alexander C. Rutherford as its sponsor. The university was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modelled on Ontario's University of Toronto Act of 1906: a bicameral system consisting of a senate (faculty) responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) controlling financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership. = Establishment in Edmonton = Heated wrangling took place between the cities of Calgary and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it. The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of Strathcona on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were amalgamated in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital. With Henry Marshall Tory as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction.\\"All True Things: A History of the University of Alberta, 1908‚Äì2008\\", Rod Macleod, The University of Alberta Press, 2008, In a letter to Alexander Cameron Rutherford in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up McGill University College in Vancouver, Tory wrote, \\"If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.\\"Tory to Rutherford, March 6, 1906. University of Alberta Archives (UAA), Rutherford Fonds, 2/3/6-8 Of the 45 students in the University's first cohort in 1908, seven were women. These original seven formed a type of sorority, called Seven Independent Spinsters, or S.I.S., with the intention of supporting the women's social and academic needs. In 1909, the group changed its name to the Wuaneita Club, and then to the Wuaneita Society in 1910. All female students at the University were initiated into the Society every fall. The group heavily appropriated from Cree culture: the name Wuaneita is a rough equivalent to the Cree word meaning \\"kind-hearted\\"; their initiation ceremonies featured costumes with feathers and headdresses; the society president was called the \\"Big Chief\\": and the motto of the group was \\"payuk uche kukeyow, mena kukeyow uche payuk,‚Äù a rough translation into Cree of \\"all for one, one for all\\" that is still engraved above the outer doors of Pembina Hall on main campus. For much of the Wuaneita Society's existence, as they were coopting First Nations traditions and ceremonies, the Potlatch ban was in effect in Canada. The group wound down in 1973 once the population of female students on campus had outgrown the need for a supportive society. Under Tory's guidance, the early years were marked by recruitment of professors and construction of the first campus buildings. Today, he has a building named after him that houses classes of all types. Percy Erskine Nobbs & Frank Darling designed the master plan for the University of Alberta in 1909‚Äì10. Nobbs designed the Arts Building (1914‚Äì15), laboratories and Power House (1914). With Cecil S. Burgess, Nobbs designed the Provincial College of Medicine (1920‚Äì21). Architect Herbert Alton Magoon designed several buildings on campus, including St. Stephen's Methodist College (1910) and the residence for professor Rupert C. Lodge (1913). The University of Alberta awarded its first degrees in 1912, the same year it established the Department of Extension. The Faculty of Medicine was established the following year, and the Faculty of Agriculture began in 1915. But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918. Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy). It awarded a range of degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA), Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Bachelor of Pharmacy (PhmB), Bachelor of Divinity (BD), Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor of Laws (LLD). There were 851 male students and 251 female students, and 171 academic staff, including 14 women.Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Canada Year Book 1921, Ottawa, 1922 = Campus expansion = The Breton Soil Plots were established at the faculty of agriculture from 1929 ‚Äì present to provide agricultural research on fertilization, usage, crop rotations and farming practices on Gray-Luvisolic soils (Gray-Wooded), which cover many regions in western Canada. The University of Alberta spearheaded an extraordinary rate of volunteerism in the Province of Alberta to the First World War, especially from its medical faculty. Experience gained was used by returning veterans to rapidly mature the young Faculty of Medicine. The War Memorial Committee commissioned a War Memorial Pipe Organ to be erected by the Casavant Fr√®res in U of A Convocation Hall in 1925 in memory of 80 University of Alberta comrades who gave up their lives during the Great War. In the early part of the 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. In 1929, the university established a College of Education. This period of growth was to be short- lived, though, as the Great Depression and the Second World War curtailed enrolment and expansion until 1945. The university also gained new public powers. In 1928, the university's senate was granted the power to oversee and appoint half of the Alberta Eugenics Board, charged with recommending individuals for sterilization. Spurred by postwar growth in the student population and the discovery of oil in Leduc in 1947, the University of Alberta underwent expansion through the 1950s that continued through the 1960s as the baby-boom generation swelled the enrolment ranks. These two decades also saw expansion of campus buildings, including new buildings for the faculties of physical education and education, and the Cameron Library. The University of Alberta Press, concentrating on western Canadian history, general science and ecology, was founded in 1969. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In addition, the single- university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary. By 1966, the University of Calgary had been established as an autonomous institution. From the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Coll√®ge Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls. New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre. Another new building, the distinctive Universiade Pavilion (nicknamed the \\"Butterdome\\"), was completed as part of the university's preparations to host the World University Games in 1983, the first time the event was held in North America. = Modern challenges = The 1990s were a time of financial constraint as the Alberta government made budgetary cutbacks. but they were also a time in which the university benefited from philanthropic support. The $11-million Timms Centre for the Arts, which began construction in 1993, was made possible by a large donation from its namesake, Albert Timms. In 1998, Gladys Young's $3.5-million donation to the university undergraduate scholarship fund in memory of Roland Young, who graduated from the U of A in 1928, was the largest private donation for undergraduate scholarships in the university's history. The early 2000s brought substantial funding increases. High energy prices drove Alberta's energy boom resulting in multibillion-dollar government surpluses and the subsequent creation of a $4.5 billion provincial post-secondary educational endowment. In 2005, the university hired Indira Samarasekera as its 12th president, embarking on an ambitious plan to establish itself as one of the world's top public research universities. These plans were hampered by the 2008 economic downturn, and by late March 2008, the university's endowment had shrunk by more than $100 million, almost 14 per cent of its value. The university predicted a $59-million budget shortfall in 2009 before provincial cuts brought that figure to $79 million. To close the budgetary gap, the university increased non-instructional fees by $290 per year laid off teaching and support staff, and even eliminated phones in some departments (such as English and Film Studies). The 2013 Alberta Budget cut provincial post- secondary grants by $147 million, including a 7.2 per cent cut to the university's base operating grant. The university is covering its resulting shortfall by reducing total spending in 2013 by $28 million, then cutting an additional $56 million to balance its budget by the spring of 2015. The 2015 Alberta Budget released in October 2015 restored a 1.4 per cent cut to the U of A's operational funding, and provided for an additional two per cent increase in the 2015-16 fiscal year. The budget also included a two-year tuition freeze. October also saw the launch of an institutional strategic planning process intended to prompt discussion and gather feedback on the university's strategic priorities, with the goal of assuming a national leadership role in post-secondary education. The 2019 Alberta Budget released in October 2019 reduced grants to the provincial post-secondary sector, including a $44-million reduction for the U of A and an additional freeze of $35 million allocated for infrastructure. In early 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the United Conservative Party announced an additional $110-million cut to funding for the U of A. While outgoing University President David Turpin announced that the cuts would necessitate 400 job losses by March 31 and more than 600 additional positions would need to be eliminated in 2020-21, incoming University President Bill Flanagan began campus discussions about how to manage the cuts, including reducing the number of faculties and departments, and streamlining administration staffing. Academics The Humanities Centre Arts Building The U of A has about 39,300 students, including 7,700 graduate students and 7,800 international students representing 151 countries. The university has 3,620 academic staff along with 15,380 support and trust staff. University professors have won more 3M Teaching Fellowships (Canada's top award for undergraduate teaching excellence) than any other Canadian university, 41 awards since 1986. The university offers post-secondary education in about 388 undergraduate and 500 graduate programs. Tuition and fees for both fall and winter semesters are slightly more than $5,000 for a typical undergraduate arts student, although they vary widely by program. The University of Alberta switched from a 9-point grading scale to the more common 4-point grading scale in September 2003. Seventy-two Rhodes Scholars have come from the University of Alberta. The University of Alberta also holds 2,599 Academic All-Canadians, the most of any University in Canada. =Faculties and colleges= The Mechanical Engineering Building The Earth Sciences building The chapel of St. Joseph's College The university has 18 faculties: * Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences focuses on natural, biological, and human resources.

The two primary media outlets amongst the student population is the student newspaper, The Gateway, and campus radio, CJSR-FM. =Greek life= From 1909 to 1929, the university held a ban against fraternities and sororities, since Henry Marshall Tory, the first president of the university, ordered all secret societies, including Upsilon Upsilon and Pi Sigma Phi, to be disbanded. The drive to remove the ban begun in 1927, when students had formed the Athenian Club to lobby the university. During the same year, several men had formed the Rocky Mountain Goat Club, which was only official sanctioned due to the lack of any secret rituals or a written constitution. The ban on fraternities and sororities would end in 1929, with the departure of President Tory. Members of the Rocky Mountain Goat Club had later formed the nucleus of the university's first fraternities. Phi Delta Theta was the first fraternity officially recognized and chartered on September 2, 1930. Fraternities and sororities are recognized as student groups by the University and Students' Union through Student Group Services. They are supported by local alumni advisors, their international headquarters, and a fraternity and sorority advisor.

An engineering student at the university had posted to the social media app Chillabit on April 17. 2018 threatening to bomb the University of Alberta North Campus and Campus Saint-Jean administration buildings. There were two such posts one of which was taken down rapidly and the other of which was brought to the attention of authorities. These posts speculated the attack sometime in the future, the police say that it could have possibly been April 30, 2018. The student identified to be a 20-year-old student of the University was \\"charged him with uttering threats and conveying a false message with intent to injure or alarm\\". Sentencing on August 17, 2018 lead to the student being \\"given a conditional discharge by Judge R.W. Brandt\\". Conditions to his discharge involved the payment of $100 as well as 100 hours of community service. The student as since returned to school at the University. Insignias and other representations =Coat of arms= Coat of Arms The university coat of arms was adopted in 1909, following the recommendations of the university's senate to adopt the coat of arms of the province of Alberta as its emblem, with the addition of an open book superimposed upon the cross and a new motto. The coat of arms had undergone a number of changes, with the arms changing in the 1950s in keeping with the graphic style of the time, and in the early 1990s, in the university's efforts to have their arms gain official heraldic authority. The latest design was completed in 1994, being registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 31 May 1994, and was presented to the university on 13 June 1994. The coat of arms consists of a shield displaying the topography of Alberta rendered in the colours of the University. At the base is a prairie wheat field symbolizing Alberta's agricultural industry. The wavy gold line above represent the hills and rivers of Alberta. The top of the shield is in gold and separated from the rest of the shield by a line suggesting the Rocky Mountains. The book of learning dominates the design. A great horned owl, the provincial bird and an accepted symbol of knowledge is used as the crest of the coat of arms. The arm's supporters is the pronghorn, taken from the provincial coat of arms, and the golden bear, the mascot of the university. =Motto and song= The motto of the university, Quaecumque vera, translates to \\"whatsoever things are true.\\" The original motto lux et lex, was first adopted in 1907, and was translated as \\"light and law\\" in Latin. The motto was substituted with the present motto in 1909. The motto was adopted from the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, the Epistle to the Philippians, where it states that, Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: Alberta, with words and music by Emma Newton; Alberta Cheer Song, with words by R.K. Michael, and music by Charleston Lamberston; The Evergreen and Gold, with words by William H. Alexander, and the music taken from the National Anthem of Russia; and Quaecumque vera, with words and music by Ewart W. Stutchbury. =Symbols= The official colours of the university are green and gold. The green represents the wide stretches of prairie land flanked by deep spruce forests and is symbolic of hope and optimism; the gold represents the golden harvest fields and is symbolic of the light of knowledge. The original suggestion for green and gold colours came from Marion Kirby Alexander, drawing inspiration from the autumn colours of the river valley below the campus. Her husband, William Hardy Alexander, a professor at the university, relayed the suggestion to a faculty meeting on 5 October 1908 and would later gain the approval of the senate. The university colours are present throughout the institution. These colours are also displayed on the university flag. The university flag consists of the shield of the coat of arms on a gold background. Notable people File:JoeClark.jpgJoe Clark, 16th Prime Minister of Canada.

They are residents in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. They should not be confused with the little green bee-eater, Merops orientalis. Migration is limited to seasonal movements depending on rainfall patterns. Members of this species, like other bee-eaters, are rich and brightly-coloured slender birds. They have green upper parts, yellow throats, black gorgets, and rich brown upper breasts fading to buffish ochre on the belly. Their wings are green and brown, and their beaks are black.

Wheeler, Speech to the Montana Historical Society, April 8, 1912 Early life Langford was born in Upstate New York and moved to Saint Paul in 1854. He worked as a banker and was involved with the investment of the Saint Anthony Park neighborhood. Montana gold fields On June 16, 1862, Langford, as a member and officer of the Northern Overland Expedition, commanded by Captain James L. Fisk, left Saint Paul to establish a wagon road to the Salmon river mine regions of the Rocky Mountains via Fort Benton. The expedition ended up at the Grasshopper Creek gold fields in the area soon to be named Bannack, Montana. There Langford and his fellow businessmen established freight companies, a saw mill and other businesses. Vigilante Langford was also part of the vigilante movement, the infamous Montana Vigilantes, that dealt with lawlessness in Virginia City and Bannack, Montana during 1863‚Äì64. In 1890, Langford wrote Vigilante Days and Ways to chronicle the era of pioneer justice in the American Old West. Territorial tax collector In 1864, shortly after the Montana Territory was established on May 28, 1864, Langford was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue and National Bank Examiner, positions he held for five years in the Montana Territorial government. Yellowstone exploration and creation National Park Langford signature from his The Discovery of Yellowstone Park (1870) Langford was a member of the 1870 Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition which explored portions of the region that soon would become the Yellowstone National Park. Mount Langford, in the Absaroka Range, east of Yellowstone Lake, was scaled by Langford and Doane during the expedition and named after him. After his participation in the Washburn expedition, Langford was appointed as the first superintendent of the park. He soon got the nickname National Park Langford because of his initials N.P. There was no money available to offer him a salary for this new position, so he had to make his living elsewhere. This left Langford with little time to run the park, and he entered it only twice during his five years as superintendent. The first time was as a guest on the second Hayden Expedition in 1872, and his second took place in 1874 to evict a man named Matthew McGuirk. McGuirk claimed to own the Boiling River ‚Äì one of the park's hot springs rumored to have healing powers. Langford had no salary, no funding for the park, and no legal way to enforce protection for its wildlife and geologic features. Political pressure, which took the guise of accusing Langford of neglect, forced the removal of Yellowstone's first superintendent in 1877. He was replaced by Philetus W. Norris. In 1905, Langford published Diary of the Washburn Expedition to the Yellowstone and Firehole In the Year 1870 as a comprehensive insider's view of the expedition. Historian 1905 Portrait of Langford from The Discovery of Yellowstone Park (1870) After his Yellowstone experiences, Langford returned to his home state of Minnesota and began a career as a Western historian. Prior to his passing he served as the President of and on the Board of Directors of the Minnesota Historical Society.

Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and other pets.  History  Painting of a Bulldog from 1790 by English artist Philip Reinagle. Painting of a Bulldog by Arthur Heyer The first reference to the word \\"Bulldog\\" is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: \\"procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp\\". In 1666, English scientist Christopher Merret applied: \\"Canis pugnax, a Butchers Bull or Bear Dog\\", as an entry in his Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum. The designation \\"bull\\" was applied because of the dog's use in the sport of bull-baiting. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling over them. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed, as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting was made illegal in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as \\"cattle\\") snakes, dogs, owls, and donkeys, so that bull- and bear-baiting, as well as cockfighting, became prohibited. Therefore, the Old English Bulldog had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or \\"working\\" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor Richard Nicolls. Because cornering and leading wild bulls were dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck.Ellis, Edward Robb (2005). The Epic of New York City ‚Äì A Narrative History. Basic Books, New York. Bulldogs as pets were continually promoted by dog dealer Bill George.Oliff, D. B. (1988) The Mastiff and Bullmastiff Handbook, The Boswell Press . Female Bulldog Despite slow maturation so that growing up is rarely achieved by two and a half years, Bulldogs' lives are relatively short. At five to six years of age, they start to show signs of aging. Though today Bulldogs look tough, they cannot perform the job they were originally created for, as they cannot withstand the rigors of running after and being thrown by a bull, and also cannot grip with such a short muzzle. Although not as physically capable as their ancestors, decreased levels of aggression associated with modern Bulldogs have resulted in a far calmer temperament, while remaining physically capable guards and companions. The oldest single breed specialty club is The Bulldog Club (England), which was formed in 1878. Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on Oxford Street in London. There they wrote the first standard of perfection for the breed. In 1894 the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk . King Orry was reminiscent of the original Bulldogs, lighter boned and very athletic. Dockleaf was smaller and heavier set, more like modern Bulldogs. King Orry was declared the winner that year, finishing the walk while Dockleaf collapsed.The sun., 11 September 1894, Page 4, Image 4 The Bulldog was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. At the turn of the 20th century, Ch. Rodney Stone became the first Bulldog to command a price of $5,000 when he was bought by controversial Irish American political figure Richard Croker. Health Bulldog puppy White-red Bulldog A 2004 UK survey of 180 Bulldog deaths puts the median age at death at 6 years 3 months. The leading cause of death of Bulldogs in the survey was cardiac related (20%), cancer (18%), and old age (9%). Those that died of old age had an average lifespan of 10 to 11 years. A 2013 UK vet clinic survey of 26 Bulldogs puts the median lifespan at 8.4 years with an interquartile range of 3.2‚Äì11.3 years.

Bulldog about to sleep Male bulldog in San Francisco Over 80% of Bulldog litters are delivered by Caesarean section because their characteristically large heads can become lodged in the mother's birth canal. The folds, or \\"rope\\", on a Bulldog's face should be cleaned daily to avoid infections caused by moisture accumulation. Some Bulldogs' naturally curling tails can be so tight to the body as to require regular cleaning and ointment. Due to the high volume of skin folds on the Bulldog's body, they have high prevalence of skin-fold dermatitis. Like all dogs, Bulldogs require daily exercise. If not properly exercised it is possible for a Bulldog to become overweight, which could lead to heart and lung problems, as well as stress on the joints.Denizet-Lewis, Benoit (22 November 2011) Can the Bulldog be Saved? The New York Times. Like all brachycephalic dogs, bully breeds often suffer from brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. The condition manifests in a variety of ways, often in the form of intolerance to heat and physical exertion. The English bulldog is among the breeds that are most severely affected by brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. Bulldogs have very small nasal cavities and this makes them have great difficulty keeping their bodies cool. Bulldogs are very sensitive to heat. Extra caution should be practiced in warmer climates and during summer months. Bulldogs must be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of standing heat. Air conditioning and good ventilation are required to keep them healthy and safe. Bulldogs actually do most of their sweating through the pads on their feet and accordingly enjoy cool floors. Like all brachycephalic, or \\"short faced\\", breeds, Bulldogs can easily become overheated and even die from hyperthermia. Bulldog owners can keep these issues under control by staying aware and protecting their Bulldog(s) from these unsafe conditions. They can be heavy breathers and tend to be loud snorers; another indicator of brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. In 2014 the Dutch Kennel Club implemented some breeding rules to improve the health of the Bulldog. Among these is a fitness test where the dog has to walk 1 km (0.62 miles) in 12 minutes. Its temperature and heart rate has to recover after 15 minutes. In January 2009, after the BBC documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed, The Kennel Club introduced revised breed standards for the British Bulldog, along with 209 other breeds, to address health concerns. Opposed by the British Bulldog Breed Council, it was speculated by the press that the changes would lead to a smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle, and a taller thinner posture, in order to combat problems with respiration and breeding due to head size and width of shoulders. In 2019, the Dutch government forbade breeding of Bulldogs. As a mascot The Bulldog is popularly used to represent England or the United Kingdom.

It is resident but prone to seasonal movements and is found widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal and the Gambia to Ethiopia, the Nile valley, western Arabia and Asia through India to Vietnam. They are mainly insect eaters and they are found in grassland, thin scrub and forest often quite far from water. Several regional plumage variations are known and several subspecies have been named.  Taxonomy and systematics  The green bee-eater was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 using its current binomial name. Several populations have been designated as subspecies: * M. o. viridissimus is found from Senegal to northern Ethiopia (has more green on the throat, crown and nape with long streamers) * M. o. cleopatra from the Nile Valley to northern Sudan * M. o. flavoviridis from northern Chad to Sudan * M. o. muscatensis on the Arabian plateau (more yellowish green with narrow gorget on throat) * M. o. cyanophrys found in Israel and the Arabian region (includes meccanus) * M. o. beludschicus(=M. o. biludschicus) Iran to Pakistan (paler colours with a blue throat) * M. o. orientalis in India and Sri Lanka (has head and neck tinged with rufous). * M. o. ferrugeiceps (=birmanus) in northeastern India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam (has rufous crown, mane and mantle). I * M. o. ceylonicus in Sri Lanka has the nape and hindneck with more pronounced golden brown sheen often included within the nominate race A study of species within the genus Merops based on plumage characteristics found that most of the subspecies of M. o. orientalis grouping together with the most similar species being Merops leschenaulti and subspecies M. o. ferrugeiceps appeared closer to that group.  Description  Subspecies muscatensis from the UAE Like other bee-eaters, this species is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is about 9 inches (16‚Äì18 cm) long with about 2 inches made up by the elongated central tail-feathers. The sexes are not visually distinguishable. The entire plumage is bright green and tinged with blue especially on the chin and throat. The crown and upper back are tinged with golden rufous. The flight feathers are rufous washed with green and tipped with blackish. A fine black line runs in front of and behind the eye. The iris is crimson and the bill is black while the legs are dark grey. The feet are weak with the three toes joined at the base. Southeast Asian birds have rufous crown and face, and green underparts, whereas Arabian beludschicus has a green crown, blue face and bluish underparts. The wings are green and the beak is black. The elongated tail feathers are absent in juveniles. Sexes are alike. The calls is a nasal trill tree-tree-tree-tree, usually given in flight. Leucistic individuals have been noted.  Distribution and habitat  M. o. muscatensis in Dubai.This is an abundant and fairly tame bird, familiar throughout its range. It is a bird which breeds in open country with bushes. In Africa and Arabia it is found in arid areas, but is more diverse in its habitats further east. This species often hunts from low perches, maybe only a metre or less high. It readily makes use of fence wires and electric wires. Unlike some other bee-eaters, they can be found well away from water. They are mostly seen in the plains but can sometimes be found up to 5000 or 6000 feet in the Himalayas. They are resident in the lowlands of South Asia but some populations move seasonally but the patterns are not clear, moving away to drier regions in the rainy season and to warmer regions in winter. In parts of Pakistan, they are summer visitors.  Behaviour and ecology  M. o. orientalis in Okanda, Sri Lanka. Like other species in the genus, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and ants, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. Before swallowing prey, a bee-eater removes stings and breaks the exoskeleton of the prey by repeatedly thrashing it on the perch. Migration is not known but they make seasonal movements in response to rainfall. These birds are somewhat sluggish in the mornings and may be found huddled next to each other on wires sometimes with their bills tucked in their backs well after sunrise. They sand-bathe more frequently than other bee-eater species and will sometimes bathe in water by dipping into water in flight. They are usually seen in small groups and often roost communally in large numbers (200-300). The birds move excitedly at the roost site and call loudly, often explosively dispersing before settling back to the roost tree. The little green bee-eater is also becoming common in urban and sub-urban neighborhoods, and has been observed perching on television antennae, only to launch into a brief, zig-zag flight formation to catch an insect, then return to the same perch and consume the meal. This behaviour is generally observed between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00am, and after 4:00pm. Sand bathing. The breeding season is from March to June. Unlike many bee- eaters, these are often solitary nesters, making a tunnel in a sandy bank. The breeding pairs are often joined by helpers. They nest in hollows in vertical mud banks. The nest tunnel that they construct can run as much as 5 feet long and the 3-5 eggs are laid on the bare ground in the cavity at the end of the tunnel. The eggs are very spherical and glossy white. Clutch size varies with rainfall and insect food density. Both sexes incubate. The eggs hatch asynchronously with an incubation period of about 14 days and the chicks grow fledge in 3 to 4 weeks and in the fledging stage show a reduction in body weight.from Sde Boker, Israelleft A study suggested that green bee-eaters may be capable of interpreting the behaviour of human observers. They showed an ability to predict whether a human at a particular location would be capable of spotting the nest entrance and then behaved appropriately to avoid giving away the nest location. The ability to look at a situation from another's point of view was previously believed to be possessed only by primates. Riverside habitats were found to support high populations in southern India (157 birds per square kilometre) dropping off too 101 per km¬≤ in agricultural areas and 43-58 per square km near human habitations. They feed on flying insects and can sometimes be nuisance to bee-keepers. The preferred prey was mostly beetles followed by hymenopterans. Orthopterans appear to be avoided. They are sometimes known to take crabs. Like most other birds they regurgitate the hard parts of their prey as pellets. An endoparasitic nematode (Torquatoides balanocephala) sometimes infects their gizzard. A protozoal parasite in their blood, Haemoproteus manwelli, has been described from India.

Norris (August 17, 1821 ‚Äì January 14, 1885) was the second superintendent of Yellowstone National Park and was the first person to be paid for that position.  Early life  Philetus Walter Norris was born in Palmyra, New York on August 17, 1821, the son of John Norris, Jr. and Azubah Phelps.Senator Robert P. Griffin, placed into the Congressional Record on June 26, 1972. His father was a pioneer mill-builder, and had fought in the War of 1812. In the early 1820s, the family moved to Allegheny County in New York.Norris family genealogy In 1826, they bought in Michigan, moving there soon thereafter. There, they survived through the Black Hawk War and several cholera plagues. John Norris fell ill, and Philetus was forced to help his mother support their rather large family.  Pre-Yellowstone years  Norris left school early to become a trapper.A spirit of Detroit, Sandra Svoboda, Metro Times, May 14, 2008 He traveled all around the midwest to trap and trade. In 1838, Norris settled in northwest Ohio near the home of a good friend. In 1845, Norris married Jane K. Cottrell of Fayette, Ohio. Once married, the couple became two of the original settlers of Pioneer, Ohio. They had four children: Edward, Aurelia, Ida and Arthur. In Pioneer, Norris built a steam mill and worked as a land agent. In the span between 1850 and 1860, Norris also travelled to the western states. When the Civil War began, Norris joined the Union troops, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel. He served as a spy behind Confederate Lines and Captain of the West Virginia Mountain Scouts. While fighting near Laurel Mountain, West Virginia, Norris's horse was shot out from underneath him, severely injuring his shoulder and spinal cord. After his injury, Norris returned to Pioneer and was elected to the Ohio Legislature. Later, he became a member of the United States Sanitary Commission, caring for the wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and also served at the Confederate prison on Kelley's Island. After the Civil War, Norris moved to Michigan, where he managed land which belonged to officers and soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies as part of a federal contract. In 1873, he founded the town of Norris, now within the boundaries of Detroit but then in Wayne County and built the Two Way Inn, which was originally the village's jail and general store. He lived there for a few years until he built a nearby house, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. There he ran a real estate business. To ensure the success of his community, Norris drained the creek that ran through the area to open up land for farming. He also recruited the railroad to run through the area and maintained the plank road that ran between Detroit and Mount Clemens, operating a tollbooth located in the village. In 1870, Norris again traveled west, entering the Yellowstone Park area; he returned again in 1875. During this time, Norris wrote a series of articles on \\"The Great West\\" which were published in the Norris, Michigan Suburban.Aubrey L. Haines Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment Preface  Yellowstone  In 1877, Norris became the second superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, a position he held until 1882. It was only in June 1878, however, that Congress finally approved a salary of $10,000 a year for the park's superintendent, as well as minimal funds \\"to protect, preserve, and improve the Park.\\"Windows Into Wonderland Yellowstone History Norris hired Harry Yount to control poaching and vandalism in the park, leading Yount to be considered the first National Park ranger. When Norris arrived in 1877 there were approximately 32 miles (51 km) of roads and 108 miles (173 km) of trails. By the time he left in 1882, there were five times as many roads and twice as many trails. The roads were crude and many described them as only \\"fair\\" wagon trails. Still, they provided access to \\"the land of wonders.\\" While superintendent, Norris published five annual reports. Three mountain peaks, including Mount Norris, one geyser basin, and one pass in Yellowstone are named after Norris.  Afterward  Norris was removed from his post at Yellowstone in 1882 due to political maneuvering. In 1883, he published a volume of verse entitled, The calumet of the Coteau, and other poetical legends of the border. Also, a glossary of Indian names, words and western provincialisms.

Afterward, he worked in ethnological research for the Smithsonian Institution. In 1885, Norris fell ill in Rocky Hill, Kentucky, while working for the Smithsonian. After a brief illness, he died in Rocky Hill, on January 14, 1885. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit three days later, and shortly thereafter his body was moved to Woodmere Cemetery.

Yount (March 18, 1839May 16, 1924) was an American Civil War soldier, mountain man, professional hunter and trapper, prospector, wilderness guide and packer, seasonal employee of the United States Department of the Interior, and the first game warden in Yellowstone National Park. He was nicknamed \\"Rocky Mountain Harry Yount\\". Yount served two terms in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He first enlisted for a six-month term in November 1861. He was wounded and taken prisoner by the Confederate States Army in an opening skirmish of the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas in March 1862, and held as a prisoner of war for nearly a month until released in a prisoner exchange. He re-enlisted in August 1862 and served until the end of the war. He was promoted three times and was a company quartermaster sergeant when he was discharged in July 1865. He worked as a hunter and a prospector, and as a bullwhacker for the U.S. Army, in the years following the Civil War. For seven years in the 1870s he worked as a guide, hunter and wrangler for the expeditions of the Hayden Geological Surveys, which mapped vast areas of the Rocky Mountains. In 1880, Yount was hired by the United States Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz, to be the first gamekeeper in Yellowstone National Park, and during his 14 months in that job wrote two annual reports for Schurz, which were then submitted to Congress. His reports described the challenges of protecting the wildlife in the first U.S. national park and influenced the culture of the National Park Service, which was founded 35 years later in 1916. Horace Albright, the second director of the National Park Service, called Yount the \\"father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger\\". Yount was a prospector during much of the last four decades of his life.  Family background and early years  Harry Yount's paternal ancestors, Hans George Jundt and Anna Marie Jundt, arrived in Philadelphia in 1731, immigrants from Alsace-Lorraine. One of their sons, Andrew Yount, followed in 1751, and later moved to Randolph County, North Carolina. Andrew was a Quaker, as were his children, including John Yount, Harry's paternal grandfather. Harry's parents were David Yount (1795‚Äì1881) and Catherine Shell Yount. With a number of other Quaker family members, they emigrated from North Carolina to Missouri in the 1830s. Harry Yount's father, David Yount, was about 44 years old at the time of Harry's birth, and Harry was the couple's tenth child. Harry Yount's uncle, George C. Yount, was a trapper and explorer who moved on from Missouri to Santa Fe and then to California before Harry's birth. In the 1830s, George C. Yount became the first citizen of the United States to settle in Napa Valley in California, which was then Mexican territory. The town of Yountville, California, is named after him. Two of Harry's older brothers, Caleb and John Yount, also moved to the Napa Valley years later. There are conflicting accounts of Harry Yount's place and date of birth. Ernest Ingersoll wrote that he was born in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, and different birth years have been mentioned by various writers, such as the anonymous author of a published biographical sketch who wrote that Yount was born in 1847, and Thomas J. Bryant, who interviewed Yount in the latter years of his life and who speculated that 1837 was his birth date in an article published in the Annals of Wyoming, journal of the Wyoming State Historical Society. However, research undertaken by William R. Supernaugh, an employee of the National Park Service, found military enlistment papers, Yount's Army pension file, and the 1840 United States Census records, all of which indicate that Yount was born on March 18, 1839. These records also show that his legal name was Henry S. Yount. His lifelong nickname was \\"Harry\\", and his middle name is unknown. Although Yount's place of birth is uncertain, Supernaugh concludes it is highly unlikely he was born in Pennsylvania, but rather in Harmony Township, Washington County, Missouri, because the 1840 census shows his father living there with a baby son. Henry was listed as 11 years old in the 1850 census. Harmony Township is a rural area about southwest of St. Louis.  Civil War military service  The 1862 Battle of Pea Ridge, where Yount was taken prisoner in a skirmish just before the battle began Yount enlisted in the Union Army for a six-month term on November 9, 1861, and served in Company F of Phelps' Regiment of the Missouri Infantry. John W. Phelps, his commanding general, was an ardent abolitionist. Yount was wounded in the leg in a skirmish just before the Battle of Pea Ridge began on March 6, 1862, and taken prisoner by the Confederates. As a captive, he was marched more than to Fort Smith in his bare feet on cold, wet roads, and was held there as a POW for 28 days before his release in a prisoner exchange. He was discharged from the Union Army in May 1862. Yount re-enlisted in Lebanon, Missouri, on August 9, 1862, and served as a private in Company H of the 8th Regiment Missouri Volunteer Cavalry, a unit involved in 11 combat engagements during his service. On April 14, 1863, he was promoted to corporal and then to sergeant on December 9, 1863; he became company quartermaster sergeant on June 13, 1864. He was discharged in Little Rock, Arkansas, on July 20, 1865, after the war had ended. As a result of his barefoot march to captivity, Yount developed rheumatism in both feet. When the Dependent and Disability Pension Act passed in 1890, he became eligible for a monthly partial disability pension of $6 in 1892, which was raised to $12 a month in 1900 and $25 in 1912. Yount was later an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic, the post-war organization of veterans of the Union Army.  Bullwhacker, hunter and trapper  Harry Yount After the Civil War ended, Yount became engaged to Estella Braun, a Western Union employee in Detroit, Michigan. She was killed in a train wreck before their wedding could take place, and he never married. Yount traveled to Fort Kearny, along the Oregon Trail in Nebraska. There he was hired as an Army bullwhacker, transporting supplies by wagon along the Bozeman Trail between Fort Laramie in modern-day Wyoming and Fort C.F. Smith in modern-day Montana. There was conflict with Native Americans in this region in those years, and Yount fought against Cheyenne and Sioux warriors several times while on the trail. In one incident, his ox wagon was harassed for four days by a party of Sioux warriors, until he fired his carbine at one warrior, hitting and probably killing the warrior's horse. Supernaugh comments that Yount believed that Indians would kill him if they could, but that he did not \\"blame the Indians for defending what was their country originally.\\" Yount also worked as a buffalo hunter during this period. He sold buffalo tongues for $1 each to tourists in Cheyenne. Yount believed that \\"it was a pity to kill off the buffaloes, which were here in immense numbers, but it was the only way to get rid of the Indians, as the buffalo were their main source of subsistence.\\" The Smithsonian Institution engaged Yount's services to collect specimens of animals for taxidermy display in the early 1870s. Because he was successful in this first assignment, Spencer F. Baird of the Smithsonian again retained Yount's services in 1875 to collect specimens of many species of Rocky Mountain mammals. It is likely that many of these were displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, as extant photos of the exhibit halls show similar specimens. During those years, Yount also began his long career as prospector, achieving some success. In 1877, Yount was the subject of a magazine profile written by Ernest Ingersoll and published in Appleton's Journal in New York. Ingersoll described Yount's expertise as a hunter, including a story that he once killed 70 antelope in one day during a competition with another hunter, but that Yount was ashamed of the accomplishment because \\"it went against his heart to kill so many innocent creatures just for the glory.\\" Yount would fill a wagon full of freshly killed game, and then sell the meat in towns such as Laramie and Cheyenne. According to Ingersoll, Yount was quite careful about his personal appearance: \\"his belt, holster, knife-sheath, bridle, and saddle are all set off with a barbaric glitter.\\" Yount paid a Shoshone woman to decorate his buckskin jacket, \\"a marvel of fringes, fur trimming and intricate embroidery of beads.\\" Ingersoll wrote that Yount was \\"by nature a gentleman, and under his sinewy frame and tireless strength, there is a heart as tender as a girl's, which hates the cruelty his profession unavoidably occasions. His eye is open to every beautiful feature of the grand world in which he lives; his heart is alive to all the gentle influences of the original wilderness.\\" Ingersoll's 1883 book, Knocking 'Round the Rockies, describes Yount in a similar fashion.  Guide for the Hayden Geological Survey  Harry Yount atop Berthoud Pass in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado In 1872 or 1873, Yount was hired as a seasonal guide, wrangler and packer for geological survey expeditions with the aim of mapping broad swaths of the Rocky Mountains. The Hayden Survey, led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and funded by the Department of the Interior, was one of several regional survey projects that were combined to form the United States Geological Survey in 1879. Hayden had been one of the leading advocates for the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law on March 1, 1872. Yount worked for Hayden's expeditions each summer for seven years during the 1870s, in what are now the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. Each winter during the period, Yount would hunt and trap in the Laramie Range in Wyoming. In 1874, Yount was assigned to hunt for a party led by the geologist Archibald Marvine. Yount was later charged by a \\"huge\\" grizzly bear, and fired four gunshots ‚Äì one through the skull, two through the flanks, and a final shot into the heart ‚Äì before the bear was brought down. During Hayden's expedition of 1877, Yount engaged in mountaineering with Ingersoll and the cartographer A. D. Wilson in the Wind River Range. They were the first to ascend the south slopes of Wind River Peak, and, with Wilson, Yount was the first to ascend West Atlantic Peak. Hayden's expedition of 1878 conducted surveys in Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas in 1878. That expedition included the British mountaineer James Eccles and Eccles's favorite Swiss mountain guide, Michel Payot of Chamonix. Eccles wanted to attempt an ascent of the Grand Teton, then unclimbed. This was the third attempt to climb the Grand Teton by members of Hayden's expeditions. Yount served as the guide in a four-man party that included Eccles, Payot and Wilson. Eccles and Payot were held up by the disappearance of two mules carrying their gear, and so were unable to accompany Wilson and Yount on to the higher parts of the mountain. During the climb, Yount slipped on the ice and fell close to a deep chasm in the glacier, where water was streaming down from the cliff above. The hold of his buckskin pants on the ice reportedly prevented him from being carried down into the crevice. Wilson was quoted as saying that Yount was clinging to the rock like \\"a starfish hanging to a breakwater,\\" and that he himself lowered a rope to assist Yount. Because of the delay and the absence of the experienced Alpine climbers, Yount and Wilson had to turn back a few hundred feet short of the summit, at a spur called The Enclosure.Ortenburger, Leigh N. and Jackson, Reynold G., A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range, The Mountaineers Books, 1996, p. 152 No previous party had come so close to reaching the summit. The undisputed first ascent of the Grand Teton took place 20 years later, in 1898.  Gamekeeper in Yellowstone National Park  Yount was hired as the first gamekeeper for Yellowstone National Park in 1880, at a salary of $1,000 per year, when the park's entire budget was just $15,000 per year. He was appointed by Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior and a former Union Army general, on June 21, 1880, and reported for duty at Yellowstone on July 6. His supervisor was Philetus Norris, the second park superintendent. Shortly after Yount reported for duty, Yount escorted Schurz and his party on a tour of the park, and then conducted a survey of the park's wildlife. Yount began constructing a winter camp at the junction of the East Fork of the Yellowstone River and Soda Butte Valley, a location he chose because it allowed for the protection of herds of buffalo and elk against poachers. Yount submitted his first Report of Gamekeeper on November 25, 1880, which was included as Appendix A to the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior. His report described his activities since being hired. He recommended: In his report of September 30, 1881, Yount described how he spent the unusually severe winter of 1880‚Äì1881, and his efforts to prevent poaching by tourists and Indians, while still hunting to provide food for the park staff. Yount reported that snow had fallen on 66 of 90 days between December 1880 and February 1881. He described the range and habits of Yellowstone's large mammals and expressed regret for \\"the unfortunate breakage of my thermometer when it could not be replaced,\\" along with a submitted synopsis of the weather the previous winter. In this report, he resigned his position \\"to resume private enterprises now requiring my personal attention,\\" and concluded with a clear recommendation: There are indications that Yount had a difference of opinion with park superintendent Norris, who wanted him to spend more of his time building roads for the convenience of tourists, while Yount preferred to concentrate on protecting the wildlife.  Recognition as first National Park ranger  Although Yount's official job title was \\"gamekeeper\\" rather than \\"park ranger\\", and although he only worked in Yellowstone National Park for 14 months, his two annual reports had a lasting impact on the administration of the national parks in the United States. He is \\"securely positioned in the legend and culture\\" of the National Park Service, and is considered a figure of \\"historic proportion\\". In Oh, Ranger!, a book published in 1928, Horace Albright, who later became the second director of the National Park Service, wrote that \\"Harry Yount pointed out in a report that it was impossible for one man to patrol the park. He urged the formation of a ranger force. So Harry Yount is credited with being the father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger.\\" Stephen Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, wrote the foreword of the book.  Prospecting and later years  After Yount resigned from his job in Yellowstone, he lived for a while in Uva, Wyoming. He homesteaded in the area in 1887 but his claim was sold in a sheriff's sale in 1892. He spent nearly 40 years prospecting in the Laramie Mountains, and developed copper and graphite mining claims. He settled in Wheatland, Wyoming, and worked on developing a marble mining claim west of there. Yount was actively involved in prospecting until the day before his death, when he had been looking for a ride to inspect a possible gold deposit. On May 16, 1924, he walked into downtown Wheatland, as was his daily habit, where he collapsed and died of heart failure near a Lutheran church. He was buried in the Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne.  Legacy  Scott Emmerich receives the 2010 Harry Yount Award from Will Shafroth Younts Peak, which is high and located in the Absaroka Range at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, is named after Yount. The peak's name was bestowed by the Hayden Geological Survey. Long after his death, in the 1970s, Yount's marble mining claim finally went into production. It yielded crushed marble for use in landscaping and aquariums. In 1994, the National Park Service established the Harry Yount Award, given annually to an employee whose \\"overall impact, record of accomplishments, and excellence in traditional ranger duties have created an appreciation for the park ranger profession.\\" This award is given both nationally and regionally. According to Supernaugh, Yount is \\"credited with setting the standards for performance and service by which the public has come to judge the rangers of today\\".

The company was incorporated in 1899 as S. S. Kresge Corporation and renamed Kmart Corporation in 1977. The first store with the Kmart name opened in 1962. At its peak in 1994, Kmart operated 2,486 stores globally, including 2,323 discount stores and Super Kmart Center locations in the United States.https://www.sec.gov/ArchivesA/edgar/data/56824/0000950124-97-002230.txt From 2005 through 2019, Kmart was a subsidiary of Sears Holdings Corporation and is now a subsidiary of Transform SR Brands LLC.  History  = Early years = 1940s postcard of Kresge store in Springfield, Massachusetts S. S. Kresge, the founder of the company that would become Kmart, met variety-store pioneer Frank Winfield Woolworth while working as a traveling salesman and selling to all 19 of Woolworth's stores at the time. In 1897 Kresge invested $6,700 saved from his job into a five-and-dime store in Memphis, Tennessee. He jointly owned the first store with his former tinware customer, John McCrory. Kresge and McCrory added a second store in downtown Detroit the following year. These were the first S.S. Kresge stores. After two years of partnership, he traded McCrory his share in the Memphis store, plus $3,000, for full ownership of the Detroit store, and formed the Kresge & Wilson Company with his brother-in-law, Charles J. Wilson. In 1912, Kresge incorporated the S.S. Kresge Company in Delaware with eighty-five stores. In 1916, Kresge incorporated a new S.S. Kresge Company in Michigan and took over the operations of the original company; the new company in Michigan is the modern day Kmart company. The company was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 1918. During World War I, Kresge experimented with raising the limit on prices in his stores to $1. By 1924, Kresge was worth approximately $375 million and owned real estate of the approximate value of $100 million.Farid-Es-Sultaneh v. Commissioner, 160 F.2d 812 (2d Cir. 1947). Growth early in the 20th century remained brisk, with 257 stores in 1924, rising to 597 stores by 1929. Kresge retired as president in 1925. The Great Depression reduced profitability and resulted in store closings, with the number rising to 682 in 1940. After the war, shopping patterns changed and many customers moved out of the cities into the suburbs. = 1960s‚Äì1970s = Logo of the S. S. Kresge Company before being renamed the Kmart Corporation in 1977 Kmart's original logo used until 1990. This logo was also used by Kmart Australia from 1969 until 1991. The Kmart Foods logo used during the 1960s Under the leadership of executive Harry Cunningham, S.S. Kresge Company opened the first Kmart-named store, at , which was referred to by Kresge as a \\"bantam\\" Kmart and was in fact originally intended to be a Kresge store until late in the planning process, on January 25, 1962, in San Fernando, California, just six months before the first Walmart opened, while the first full-size Kmart, at , opened on March 1, 1962, in Garden City, Michigan. Sixteen more Kmart stores opened in 1962. Kmart Foods, a now-defunct chain of Kmart supermarkets, opened in that decade. Though the store chain continued to open Kmart branded stores, the store chain was still officially called S.S. Kresge Company. Company founder Kresge died on October 18, 1966 at age 99. Around the time of the opening of the first Kmart, some poorly performing S.S. Kresge stores were converted to a new \\"Jupiter Discount Stores\\" brand, which was conceived as a bare-bones, deep discount outfit. During the 1970s, Kmart put a number of competing retailers out of business. Kresge, Jupiter and Kmart stores mainly competed with other store chains like Zayre, Ames, Bradlees, Caldor, Hills, and those that were operated by MMG-McCrory Stores (McCrory, McLellan, H.L. Green, J.J. Newberry, S.H. Kress, TG&Y;, Silver's and eventually G.C. Murphy Co.). In 1977, S.S. Kresge Company changed its name to K Mart Corporation. = 1980s = In 1980, Vice Chairman Bernard M. Fauber was elected as the Chairman and as the CEO of Kmart. In 1981, the 2,000th Kmart store opened. By the end of 1981, there were 2,055 Kmart stores across the United States and Canada. In 1987, the Kmart Corporation sold its remaining 76 Kresge and Jupiter stores in the United States to McCrory Stores, and the brands were almost entirely discontinued, although Canadian Kresge and Jupiter stores continued to operate until 1994. Kmart experimented with co-branding in 1985, when the in-store cafeteria at the store in Canton, Michigan, was converted to a Wendy's. Until November 1990, when it was passed by Walmart, Kmart was the second-largest retailer in the United States, after Sears. During the 1980s, the company's fortunes began to change; many of Kmart's stores were considered to be outdated and in decaying condition. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the corporate office shifted much of its focus from the Kmart stores to other companies it had acquired or created, such as Sports Authority, Builders Square, and Waldenbooks. = Blue Light Special = The Blue Light Special was a sale promotion within the store for a short period within store hours only. It was advertised using a rotating blue light, in the same style a police car used, and was announced over the store public address system with the phrase \\"attention Kmart shoppers\\", a phrase which became a pop culture reference. The original Blue Light Special, first introduced in 1965, was retired in 1991. The company brought back the Blue Light Special in 2001, but again discontinued it in 2002. The concept was briefly revived in 2005, though Kmart at that time had no plans to use the concept long-term. Blue Light Specials were revived again in 2009 on Saturdays, offering surprise hour-long sales on selected merchandise, but were discontinued again. Blue Light Specials were revived once again in November 2015. = 1990‚Äì2001: New image = The exterior of the first Super Kmart Center store in Medina, Ohio, as it appears after its closure in 2012In 1990, in an effort to update its image, Kmart introduced a new logo. It dropped the old-style italic \\"K\\" with a turquoise \\"mart\\" in favor of a red block letter K with the word \\"mart\\" written in script and contained inside the \\"K\\". Kmart then began remodeling stores shortly thereafter. This logo was replaced in 2004 with the current logo. In 1990, Little Caesars Pizza Station opened its first in-store Kmart restaurant in Rochester, Michigan (coincidentally, both Little Caesars and Kmart were founded in Garden City, Michigan, in 1959 and 1962 respectively). In 1995, Kmart also tried to reinvent itself by using the short-lived name Today's Kmart. In 1991, the company revised its name slightly to Kmart Corporation. In 1992, Kmart entered the Eastern European market with the purchase of 13 stores in the former Czechoslovakia. These stores were sold off in 1996. The company also began to offer exclusive merchandise by Martha Stewart, Kathy Ireland, Jaclyn Smith, Lauren Hutton, and Thal√≠a. Other recognizable brands included exclusively licensed merchandising of products relating to Sesame Street and Disney. Actress and television personality Rosie O'Donnell and actress/director and producer Penny Marshall became among the company's most recognized spokespersons. Kmart's red classic logo (1990‚Äì2004) The Super Kmart Center logo that was used primarily in the early 1990s, but was also used for some stores that opened in 2001. This logo was also used on the former Super Kmart Center stores in Mexico during the 1990s.

Kmart's profitability and sales peaked in 1992, and have since declined due to competition with Walmart, Target, and internet shopping. In 1994, Kmart announced they would close 110 stores. Unlike its competitors Walmart and Target, Kmart failed to invest in computer technology to manage its supply chain. Furthermore, Kmart maintained a high dividend, which reduced the amount of money that was available for improving its stores. Many business analysts also faulted the company for failing to create a coherent brand image. In September 1995, Kmart sold its money-losing in-store auto repair centers to Penske Corporation for $112 million to operate them as Penske Auto Centers.

In 2001, Kmart opened several new Kmart Super Center stores as part of Kmart's plan to expand their Kmart Super Center store portfolio, along with Kmart trying to make groceries available at stores as well. However, due to Kmart filing for bankruptcy in January 2002, Kmart was unable to open any more new Kmart Super Center stores, and any of the Kmart Super Center stores that were under construction during Kmart's 2002 bankruptcy were halted, no matter how close the stores were to completion.

On January 22, 2002, Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the leadership of its then-chairman Charles Conaway and president Mark Schwartz. Conaway, who successfully expanded CVS Corporation, accepted an offer to take the helm at Kmart along with a loan of $5 million (equivalent to $ in ). In a scandal similar to that involving Enron, Conaway and Schwartz were accused of misleading shareholders and other company officials about the company's financial crisis while making millions and allegedly spending the company's money on airplanes, houses, boats and other luxuries. At a conference for Kmart employees on January 22, Conaway accepted \\"full blame\\" for the financial disaster. As Kmart emerged from bankruptcy, Conaway was forced to step down, and was asked to pay back all the loans he had taken. After dismissing Conaway and Schwartz, Kmart closed more than 300 stores in the U.S., including all the Kmart stores in Alaska, and laid off around 34,000 workers as part of the restructuring process. Kmart introduced five prototype stores with a new logo, layout, and lime green and gray color scheme, one in White Lake, Michigan, and four in central Illinois: (Peoria, Pekin, Morton and Washington). The new layout was touted as having wider aisles and improved selection and lighting, and the city or town's name was featured under the new Kmart logo at the front entrance. However, Kmart could not afford a full-scale rollout. The lime green prototype was abandoned for the new Kmart \\"Orange\\" concept that rolled out at several of its locations throughout the United States in 2006.

On June 10, 2003, Kmart began trading on the NASDAQ stock market with the ticker symbol of KMRT with Lampert serving as the chairman and with ESL Investments controlling 53% of the new company for an investment of less than $1 billion. Lampert dismissed his concerns that the smaller company would be at a disadvantage, stating \\"The focus that a lot of people have in retail revolves around sales, but sales without profit do not allow a business to be successful in the long term.\\" He began to improve the company's balance sheet by reducing inventory, cutting costs, and closing underperforming stores. By the fourth quarter of 2003, Kmart posted its first profitable quarter in three years, although it has since returned to an operating loss. On August 12, 2004, Kmart and E! Entertainment Television announced a new, exclusive, cross-promotional clothing brand called Attention.

In 2006, the company discontinued the Sears Essentials name, and renamed all of the Sears Essentials stores as Sears Grand stores. Kmart started remodeling stores to the \\"Orange\\" prototype in 2005. In 2006, the typical white and blue interior of the stores was changed to orange and brown, and shelf heights were lowered to create better sightlines. The remodeled stores contain an appliance department with Kenmore Appliances and most have hardware departments that sell Craftsman tools, which prior to the merger had been exclusive to Sears stores. Some auto centers left vacant by Penske after Kmart filed for bankruptcy had been converted to Sears Auto Centers. As of 2009, 280 stores had been remodeled to this new prototype.

There is also no evidence that kmart.com customers were impacted. This data breach has been contained and the malware has been removed. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our members and customers.\\" In January 2015, Kmart agreed to pay $102,048 and other consideration to settle a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disability discrimination lawsuit.

They also offered a full breakfast menu of baked goods, bagels and egg platters with bacon or sausage and such snacks as nachos, pretzels, popcorn and ice cream. In addition to the caf√©'s menu, hot food items could also be purchased at the deli and eaten in the Deli Caf√© at Super Kmart Center stores. However, K-Caf√© has been discontinued in almost all of their stores. Most restaurants that were located at Super Kmart Center stores were instead known as Super K-Caf√©. However, some Kmart stores have Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eateries and Little Caesars Pizza Stations instead of K-Caf√©s, like the Kmart store in Marshall, Michigan and another located in Guam. * KDollar was a chain of discount stores/dollar stores that sold Kmart merchandise at a discount. The stores were often former Kmart or Big Kmart stores. Sears Brands filed for a trademark on the KDollar name on November 6, 2012. The first opened in a former regular Kmart store in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan in 2013. A second KDollar store opened in Waukegan, Illinois. * Kmart Chef restaurants were a small chain of free-standing fast-food restaurants owned by Kmart, started in 1967 with the first location on the parking lot of a Kmart in Pontiac, Michigan. The \\"limited, high-turnover menu\\" (as Kmart founder S.S. Kresge put it) consisted of hamburgers, French fries, hot dogs, and soft drinks. The Kmart Chef chain folded in 1974 after peaking at 11 locations. * Kmart Dental was an in-store dental office located in Kmart stores. There was only one such prototype in a Kmart store, in Miami, Florida. Despite the name, Kmart Dental was never technically owned by Kmart. * Kmart Express was a chain of gas stations/convenience stores located in out-parcels at some Kmart and Super Kmart stores, particularly in the Midwest. In the early 2000s, there were plans to expand this concept to most Kmarts, but the plan for more locations was canceled after Kmart's bankruptcy in 2002. The final Kmart Express, in Ionia, MI, closed in 2017. * Kmart Food Stores was a supermarket chain founded in 1962. Most Kmart Food locations were paired with Kmart stores, often operated by a local grocery chain but always branded as Kmart Food. The chain was discontinued in the early 1980s. * Kwash was an attached-to-store laundromat launched in May 2010. Only one such prototype existed. It was in a former auto bay in Iowa City, Iowa. It featured a separate entrance, laundromat attendants and free wi-fi along with a limited selection of laundry goods available for purchase. The Kwash closed along with the Kmart in 2017. * Makro, a Dutch warehouse club chain, operated locations in the U.S. from February 1981 to 1989, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and the Washington, D.C. suburb of Largo, Maryland. Kmart bought the chain's entire American holdings in 1989, having owned a 49 percent share before. The Makro stores were later converted to Pace or closed in 1990. * Office Square was a chain selling office supplies and office furniture which was a spin-off of Builders Square. In 1991, OfficeMax was acquired by Kmart and Office Square was merged into OfficeMax stores. * OfficeMax is a chain selling office supplies and office furniture which was acquired in 1991 and sold in 1995. It was acquired by Office Depot in 2013. * Pace Membership Warehouse was Kmart's warehouse club brand, until the chain was purchased by Walmart. In 1993, Walmart converted most of the stores into its Sam's Club brand, and sold others to chains such as Bradlees. * PayLess Drugs was a chain of drug stores acquired by Kmart in 1985 and later sold to TCH Corporation in 1994. The resulting entity, Thrifty PayLess, was acquired by Rite Aid in 1996, which converted all of the PayLess and Thrifty stores into Rite Aid stores in 1999. The PayLess division also owned Bi-Mart, which was spun off along with sister stores such as Pay 'n Save. * The Sports Authority was a chain of sporting goods stores which was acquired in 1990 and sold in 1995. The Sports Authority went out of business in 2016. * Super Kmart Center was a chain of superstores that carried everything a regular Kmart carries, but also had a full grocery section with meat and poultry, baked goods, a delicatessen, garden produce, and fresh seafood. Kmart Super Centers ranged from . The first store opened in Medina, Ohio, on July 25, 1991. A few stores that were built in the late 1990s were known instead as Super Kmart. Super Kmart Center stores also featured a garden center, a video rental store, a branch of a local bank, an arcade, a portrait studio, a Jackson Hewitt tax center, a pharmacy, and usually a deli caf√© or Little Caesars Pizza Station. Many of these services were closed and discontinued in recent years. Several locations also included Kmart Express gas stations, and most had an auto center. Most Kmart Super Centers were closed during the two rounds of closures in 2002 and 2003, and many had their groceries removed, converting them into regular Kmart locations. A typical Super Center sold around $30 million of merchandise during one fiscal year. In 2015, some stores were converted into a regular Kmart with a concept called K-Fresh. These stores feature an expanded pantry and a fresh-food department, though these types of items are no longer prepared on-site and are now prepackaged. The deli, butcher and bakery operations were also closed. Kmart gradually closed its Super Kmart stores; the last location was in Howland Township, Ohio and closed on April 8, 2018. It is scheduled to be replaced by Kmart competitor Meijer. * U-Pak was a single \\"no-frills\\" supermarket which sold items out of boxes instead of on shelves, and featured reduced hours. It opened adjacent to a Kmart on Opdyke Boulevard in Pontiac, Michigan in 1979 and closed less than a month later due to poor sales. * Variety Outlet. A closeout chain, typically operated out of closed Kmart stores. The first opened in Rome, Georgia in 1994. * Waldenbooks was a chain consisting primarily of shopping-mall‚Äìbased book stores which was acquired in 1984. In 1994, Kmart chain Borders merged with Waldenbooks to form Borders-Walden Group, which was sold in 1995 (the company was subsequently renamed Borders Group, and went out of business in 2011). = Philanthropy = Kmart for Kids is the umbrella program for Kmart's philanthropic initiatives. The program helps children across the country live happier, healthier lives through the support of: March of Dimes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and American Diabetes Association. Kmart is March of Dimes' number 1 corporate sponsor, having raised $114 million for the charity over more than 30 years. On July 29, 2008, Don Germano, SVP/GM of Kmart stores, was elected to a five- year term on the national Board of Trustees of the March of Dimes Foundation. Kmart for Kids supports St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital through its annual Thanks and Giving campaign, an opportunity for Kmart customers to give thanks for the healthy children in their lives and give to help those who are not. Kmart has been a partner of the campaign since 2006, and , had raised more than $59.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) for St. Jude's. A record $21.9 million (equivalent to $ in ) was donated for the tenth annual fundraising campaign during the 2013 holiday season. In 2008, Kmart earned the \\"Outstanding Corporate Citizen\\" Award for its support of the American Diabetes Association's \\"Step Out: Walk to Fight Diabetes\\" program. The tribute honors Kmart for the most well-developed, proactive program in the areas of charity, community development, diversity, philanthropy, and associate development. In 2008 Kmart became a national sponsor of \\"Step Out: Walk to Fight Diabetes\\" and over the past two years, Kmart's customers and associates have raised approximately $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) through its in-store campaigns. = Environmental record = On May 9, 2007, Kmart was penalized $102,422 (equivalent to $ in ) for violations of federal hazardous waste, clean water, emergency planning and preparation regulations at 17 distribution centers. Kmart corrected the violations by preparing and implementing spill- prevention control and countermeasure plans, applying for appropriate storm- water permits, complying with hazardous-waste-generator requirements, and submitting reports to state and local emergency-planning and response organizations informing them of the presence of hazardous substances. The Environmental Protection Agency also accused Kmart of not maintaining adequate information and failing to act in accordance with hazardous-waste-storage and disposal requirements. For instance, the EPA reported having discovered improperly labeled oil-storage drums at a location in Falls, Pennsylvania. Out of concern for the environment, Kmart promoted battery recycling. In 1990, Kmart even proposed spending about $80 million (equivalent to $ in ) on full- page newspaper advertisements offering to recycle junk batteries for $2 (equivalent to $ in ) each. In 2012, Kmart and Sears began to allow customers who are members of their Shop Your Way Rewards program to receive receipts by e-mail, eliminating paper waste and cutting down on the usage of ink. = Animal welfare concerns = In 2012, Mercy for Animals, a non-profit organization working against cruelty to farmed animals, conducted an infiltration at Christensen Farms, a pork supplier to Kmart, Walmart and Costco, obtaining hidden-camera footage of pigs confined in small gestation crates and cruelty to piglets. In response to Mercy For Animals' infiltration, Kmart announced it would begin requiring its pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates. = Racing sponsorships = Kmart was a prominent sponsor in NASCAR and the now-defunct CART series. They were a longtime sponsor of Newman/Haas Racing, owned by actor Paul Newman and former racer Carl Haas. Their CART drivers included Nigel Mansell and the father-son duo of Michael and Mario Andretti. Michael Andretti and Mansell won championships under Kmart sponsorship in 1991 and 1993, respectively. The store also sponsored the NASCAR-sanctioned Kmart 400 at Michigan and North Carolina Speedway. Lake Speed garnered Kmart's first win in NASCAR in 1988 at the Darlington Raceway. Kmart sponsored three-time champion Darrell Waltrip in 1999 and 2000, his last two full-time seasons. Most recently, in NASCAR, the store sponsored Boris Said's #60 No Fear Ford Fusion in 2006.  International  = Australia and New Zealand = Kmart Australia logo The first Kmart in Australia opened in 1969 in Burwood East, Victoria; the site was renovated in 2010 to be a shopping mall known as Burwood One. Kmart Australia was born out of a joint venture between G.J. Coles & Coy Limited (Coles) and S.S. Kresge Company, with Kresge owning 51% of the common stock in the company. The first New Zealand store opened in Henderson in 1988. Kresge later exited this partnership. Since 2007, the Australian and New Zealand Kmart stores are owned by Wesfarmers. = Canada = Kmart Canada logo used from 1990 to 1998 Former Kmart Store in Bayers Lake, Nova Scotia shown in 1994. Canadian Tire now operates in its place. Kmart once had a major presence in Canada, with its first Kresge store opening in 1929. Kmart closed five Montreal stores and several other Quebec stores in 1983 due to the company restructuring. Kresge ceased to exist in Canada in 1994. In December 1997, it was announced that ten of the existing 122 stores were to be closed. However, as a result of Kmart's ongoing financial difficulties, the Canadian division comprising 112 stores was sold to competitor Zellers of the Hudson's Bay Company in May 1998, after which the stores were either closed or converted to Hudson's Bay Company brands, mostly Zellers.  Slogans  *The Saving Place 1960s‚Äì1990 *Your Lowest Price is a Kmart Price 1990‚Äì1998 = Caribbean = In late 2000, Kmart tried to expand into Caribbean countries where Wal-Mart and Target had no presence, but ultimately none of the proposed stores advanced beyond the construction stage and none opened by the time Kmart filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when it stopped paying its construction contractors. Kmart started construction of a Super Kmart in 2001 in Trinidad, but halted it in 2002 when the store was 80 percent complete. There were plans for more stores to be built in Trinidad, as well as in Millennium Heights in Barbados, five stores in the Dominican Republic, and a potential foray into Jamaica. The unfinished Super Kmart store in Trinidad and Tobago is now a Tru Value Supermarket. = Europe = Kmart in Bratislava, Slovakia during the early 1990s In 1992, Kmart purchased several communist-era department stores in Eastern Europe, including 13 in the former Czechoslovakia that were bought from the former Czechoslovak government. One of those stores was the old M√ÅJ department store on N√°rodn√≠ T≈ô√≠da in Prague. Many of these outlets were quite profitable, with the Bratislava location setting a single- store sales record for the company. In March 1996, due to its troubles in the U.S., the Kmart Corporation announced that it had agreed to sell the six Kmart stores in the Czech Republic and the seven in Slovakia to Tesco PLC of Britain for about $117.5 million (equivalent to $ in ), to focus on its core operations in North America. = Mexico = In the 1990s, Kmart opened four stores in Mexico, in partnership with the Mexican retailer Liverpool. All were supercenters located in suburbs of Mexico City. About half of the store area was devoted to groceries, and this part of the stores resembled those in the US with some adjustments to the local market. These plus an unfinished store were sold in 1997 to the Mexican hypermarket chain Mega (part of Comercial Mexicana) and remain open under that name, except the store in Tlalnepantla, which was demolished in 2004 to build a Costco. = Singapore = In 1994, Kmart opened a 9,700-square-metre (104,000 sq ft) store in the Marina Square Shopping Center in a joint venture with Metro (Private) Limited. The joint venture with Singapore was dissolved in 1996.  Management  *S. S.

He is a male figure most likely named after the Near Eastern goddess Astarte. Background The name Astaroth was ultimately derived from that of 2nd millennium BCE Phoenician goddess Astarte,Lon Milo DuQuette and Christopher S. Hyatt. Aleister Crowley's Illustrated Goetia (1992). New Falcon: Temple, AZ, USA, p. 52. an equivalent of the Babylonian Ishtar, and the earlier Sumerian Inanna. She is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the forms Ashtoreth (singular) and Ashtaroth (plural, in reference to multiple statues of her). This latter form was directly transliterated in the early Greek and Latin versions of the Bible, where it was less apparent that it had been a plural feminine in Hebrew. Appearances in literature The name \\"Astaroth\\" as a male demon is first known from The Book of Abramelin, purportedly written in Hebrew c. 1458, and recurred in most occult grimoires of the following centuries. Astaroth also features as an archdemon associated with the qliphoth (adverse forces) according to later Kabbalistic texts. Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer also described Astaroth in his Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (1577) thus: \\"Astaroth is a great and a strong duke, coming forth in the shape of a foul angel, sitting upon an infernal dragon, and carrying on his right hand a viper\\", who also claimed to rule 40 legions. Also, he had to be approached by the conjurer with a magical ring on account of his stinking breath. He is similarly referred to in the 17th-century work The Lesser Key of Solomon. According to some demonologists of the 16th century, August is the month during which this demon's attacks against man are stronger. According to Sebastien Michaelis, he is a demon of the First Hierarchy, who seduces by means of laziness, self- doubt, and rationalized philosophies. His adversary is St. Bartholomew, who can protect against him for he has resisted Astaroth's temptations. To others, he teaches mathematical sciences and handicrafts, can make men invisible and lead them to hidden treasures, and answers every question formulated to him. He was also said to give to mortal beings the power over serpents. According to Francis Barrett (c. 1801), Astaroth is the prince of accusers and inquisitors. In art, in the Dictionnaire Infernal (1818), Astaroth is depicted as a nude man with feathered wings, wearing a crown, holding a serpent in one hand, and riding a beast with dragon-like wings and a serpent-like tail. Appearances in film Ashtaroth is one of three demons summoned by Faustus to attack Benvolio in Doctor Faustus. The \\"Star of Astaroth\\" features prominently in the 1971 Disney film \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" and strongly resembles the symbol in Seal of Solomon. Astaroth is named in the 1976 Hammer horror film To the Devil a Daughter. In the 1920 silent horror film The Golem: How He Came into the World, Rabbi Loew and his assistant summon Astaroth to animate the Golem resulting in deadly and destructive results. Astaroth also appears in the 2007 television series Blood Ties. Symbol appears in the first few episodes. Astaroth symbolism is also prevalent in the 2018 movie Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made and a symbol of Astaroth appears in the movie over 170 times. The Solomonic seal of Astaroth makes an appearance in Pyewacket. See also * Asherah * Atargatis References Sources * S. L. MacGregor Mathers, A.

The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958, by the British magazine New Statesman to refer to its political and social agenda.The Compact Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, Clarendon Press, 1991. Antiestablishmentarianism (or anti-establishmentarianism) is an expression for such a political philosophy.  Anti-establishment in Australia  Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party and the United Australia Party (formerly Palmer United) have both been referred to as anti-establishment parties.  Anti- establishment in Canada  The People's Party of Canada is seen as anti- establishment political partyBernier was accused by prominent Conservative politicians such as former prime ministers Stephen Harper and Brian Mulroney of trying to divide the political right. Bernier responded to Power and Politics that he wanted to focus on the disaffected voters stating that \\"there is 20 per cent of the population who do not even bother to vote that his party will debate discussions that \\"the leadership and the caucus\\" did not want to have when he was a party member.  Anti-establishment in Iceland  The Pirate Party of Iceland has a movement of anti-establishment.  Anti- establishment in India  In India, the 1960s saw emergence of a group of writers who called themselves Hungryalists. They were the first anti- establishment and counter culture writers in Bengal whose dissenting voice drew attention of the government and court cases were filed against them.Amritalok ISSN.0971-4308 The main anti-establishment voices in Bengali literature have been Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury, Subimal Basak, Falguny Roy and Tridib Mitra. However, anti-establishment littlemag movement is still active both in Bangladesh and West Bengal.  Anti-establishment in Italy  The Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League are considered anti- establishment parties. The M5S led by Luigi Di Maio won the most votes in the 2018 Italian general election and formed the largest groups in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. The center-right electoral alliance led by League's secretary Matteo Salvini won a pluralities of seats in both houses. The M5S and the League agreed to form a government coalition, which resulted in Giuseppe Conte being appointed Prime Minister and forming the 65th government of the Italian Republic. Power to the People, a left-wing to far- left electoral alliance comprising several parties, organizations, associations, committees and social centers, is also an anti-establishment movement. In its manifesto, membership to Power to the People is described as \\"social and political, anti-liberist and anti-capitalist, communist, socialist, environmentalist, feminist, secular, pacifist, libertarian and southernist left-wing\\", whose goal as coalition is \\"to create real democracy, through daily practices, self-governance experiments, socialisation of knowing and popular participation\\". In the 2018 general election, they obtained 370,320 votes for the Chamber of Deputies (1.13%) and 319,094 votes for the Senate (1.05%), without electing any representatives.  Anti-establishment in Mexico  The election of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as Mexico President was deemed as anti-establishment by pundits.  Anti-establishment in the United Kingdom  In the UK anti-establishment figures and groups are seen as those who argue or act against the ruling class. Having an established church, in England, a British monarchy, an aristocracy, and an unelected upper house in Parliament made up in part by hereditary nobles, the UK has a clearly definable Establishment against which anti-establishment figures can be contrasted. In particular, satirical humour is commonly used to undermine the deference shown by the majority of the population towards those who govern them. Examples of British anti-establishment satire include much of the humour of Peter Cook and Ben Elton; novels such as Rumpole of the Bailey; magazines such as Private Eye; and television programmes like Spitting Image, That Was The Week That Was, and The Prisoner (see also the satire boom of the 1960s). Anti-establishment themes also can be seen in the novels of writers such as Will Self. However, by operating through the arts and media, the line between politics and culture is blurred, so that pigeonholing figures such as Banksy as either anti-establishment or counter-culture figures can be difficult. The tabloid newspapers such as The Sun, are less subtle, and commonly report on the sex-lives of the Royals simply because it sells newspapers, but in the process have been described as having anti-establishment views that have weakened traditional institutions. On the other hand, as time passes, anti- establishment figures sometimes end up becoming part of the Establishment, as Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones frontman, became a Knight in 2003, or when The Who frontman Roger Daltrey was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 in recognition of both his music and his work for charity.  Anti-establishment in the United States  Individuals who were anti- establishment often spoke of \\"fighting the man\\", \\"selling out to the Establishment\\", and \\"tearing down the Establishment.\\" Many well renowned activists and activist groups innovated great changes to society by standing up to \\"the Establishment\\", including the MC5, Symbionese Liberation Army, Black Panther Party, Dr.Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Malvina Reynolds, Dead Kennedys, Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Bernie Sanders, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Public Enemy, System of a Down, K-Rino, Immortal Technique, Black Flag, Rage Against the Machine, Terminator X, Gil-Scott Heron, dead prez, Timothy Leary, Paris, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Lupe Fiasco, American Legislative Exchange Council, Tea Party Movement, Powell Memo, National Prayer Breakfast, among others. The \\"Establishment\\" to these, and these anti-establishment activists was not simply the people of the older generation. Dictionary.com defines the establishment as \\"the existing power structure in society; the dominant groups in society and their customs or institutions; institutional authority\\", Merriam-Webster defines the words as \\"a group of social, economic, and political leaders who form a ruling class\\" and The Free Dictionary defines it as \\"A group of people holding most of the power and influence in a government or society.\\" Social critic and \\"people's\\" historian Howard Zinn defines the establishment as \\"Republicans, Democrats, newspapers [and] television\\" in his book, A People's History of the United States. Later Zinn calls out the \\"huge military establishment\\" which one could assume is part of his definition of the \\"Establishment.\\" In a chapter of the book that expresses Zinn's political theory for the future he defines \\"the Establishment [as] that uneasy club of business executives, generals, and politicos.\\"Zinn, Howard. \\"The Coming Revolt of the Guards.\\" History Is A Weapon. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 March 2012. . Later in Zinn's book is a reprinted quote from Samuel Huntington, who was a Harvard University political science professor and White House political consultant, that describes the establishment and the coalition a president should establish upon being elected: :\\"...the President act[s]...with the support and cooperation of key individuals and groups in the executive office, the federal bureaucracy, Congress, and the more important businesses, banks, law firms, foundations, and media, which constitute the private sector's \\"Establishment.\\"...The day after [the President's]...election, the size of his majority is almost ‚Äî if not entirely ‚Äî irrelevant to his ability to govern the country. What counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions in a society and government. ... This coalition must include key people in Congress, the executive branch, and the private-sector 'Establishment'.\\"Zinn, Howard. \\"The Seventies: Under Control?.\\" History Is A Weapon. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 March 2012. . = Early usage = The anti-establishment began in the 1940s and continued through the 1950s. Many World War II veterans, who had seen horrors and inhumanities, began to question every aspect of life, including its meaning. Urged to return to \\"normal lives\\" and plagued by post traumatic stress disorder (discussing it was \\"not manly\\"), many veterans found suburbia cloying and empty. The Hells Angels were originally composed of WWII veterans feeling rebellious: the name came from WWII fighting units. The image of Marlon Brando as a motorcycle rebel in The Wild One and James Dean as a Rebel Without a Cause horrified some Americans and electrified others. Some veterans, who founded the Beat Movement, were denigrated as Beatniks and accused of being \\"downbeat\\" on everything. Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote a Beat autobiography that cited his wartime service. Many people craved angry \\"true\\" commentary such as Lenny Bruce's acid-tongued comedy, or simply a desire for more personal freedom, even \\"vices\\". Playboy magazine, with its famous nudes, was the first skin mag sold alongside national magazines, and caused a scandal and backlash. Many women also harbored a deep resentment. During the war years, they had been encouraged to assume men's roles in industry, both white collar and blue collar. Rosie the Riveter was a national icon. But after the war, women were forced to give up their jobs and become homemakers. Citizens had also begun to question authority, especially after the Gary Powers U-2 Incident, wherein President Eisenhower repeatedly assured people the USA was not spying on Russia, then was caught in a blatant lie. This general dissatisfaction was popularized by Peggy Lee's laconic pop song \\"Is That All There Is?\\", but remained unspoken and unfocused. It was not until the Baby Boomers came along in huge numbers that protest became organized (or disorganized in the case of the hippies), who were named by the Beats as \\"little hipsters\\". = 1960s = \\"Anti-establishment\\" became a buzzword of the tumultuous 1960s. Young people raised in comparative luxury saw many wrongs perpetuated by society and began to question \\"the Establishment\\". Contentious issues included the ongoing Vietnam War with no clear goal or end point, the constant military build-up and diversion of funds for the Cold War, perpetual widespread poverty being ignored, money-wasting boondoggles like pork barrel projects and the Space Race, festering race issues, a stultifying education system, repressive laws and harsh sentences for casual drug use, and a general malaise among the older generation. On the other side, \\"Middle America\\" often regarded questions as accusations, and saw the younger generation as spoiled, drugged-out, sex-crazed, unambitious slackers. Anti-establishment debates were common because they touched on everyday aspects of life. Even innocent questions could escalate into angry diatribes. For example, \\"Why do we spend millions on a foreign war and a space program when our schools are falling apart?\\" would be answered with \\"We need to keep our military strong and ready to stop the Communists from taking over the world.\\" As in any debate, there were valid and unsupported arguments on both sides. \\"Make love not war\\" invoked \\"America, love it or leave it.\\" As a hippie, Ken Westerfield helped to popularize Frisbee as an alternative disc sport in the 1960s and 1970s. As the 1960s simmered, the anti-Establishment adopted conventions in opposition to the Establishment. T-shirts and blue jeans became the uniform of the young because their parents wore collar shirts and slacks. Drug use, with its illegal panache, was favored over the legal consumption of alcohol. Promoting peace and love was the antidote to promulgating hatred and war. Living in genteel poverty was more \\"honest\\" than amassing a nest egg and a house in the suburbs. Rock 'n roll was played loudly over easy listening. Dodging the draft was passive resistance to traditional military service. Dancing was free- style, not learned in a ballroom. Over time, anti-establishment messages crept into popular culture: songs, fashion, movies, lifestyle choices, television. The emphasis on freedom allowed previously hushed conversations about sex, politics, or religion to be openly discussed. A wave of radical liberation movements for minority groups came out of the 1960s, including second-wave feminism; Black Power, Red Power, and the Chicano Movement; and gay liberation. These movements differed from previous efforts to improve minority rights by their opposition to respectability politics and militant tone. Programs were put in place to deal with inequities: Equal Opportunity Employment, the Head Start Program, enforcement of the Civil Rights Act, busing, and others. But the widespread dissemination of new ideas also sparked a backlash and resurgence in conservative religions, new segregated private schools, anti-gay and anti-abortion legislation, and other reversals. Extremists tended to be heard more because they made good copy for newspapers and television. In many ways, the angry debates of the 1960s led to modern right-wing talk radio and coalitions for \\"traditional family values\\". As the 1960s passed, society had changed to the point that the definition of the Establishment had blurred, and the term \\"anti-establishment\\" seemed to fall out of use. = 1960s to present: the use of anti-establishment rhetoric in American politics = Howard Zinn, in his bestseller titled A People's History of the United States mentions the concept of \\"establishment\\" several times in the book.

The club was founded on May 28, 1892, in San Francisco, California, by the Scottish-American preservationist John Muir, who became the first president, as well as the longest serving president at approximately 20 years in this leadership position. The Sierra Club operates only in the United States. Sierra Club Canada is separated from the Sierra Club. Traditionally associated with the progressive movement, the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting sustainable energy, mitigating global warming, and opposing the use of coal. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports liberal and progressive candidates in elections. The Sierra Club is organized on both a national and state level with chapters named for the 50 states and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and Washington D.C.) with the sole exception being California that has many chapters named for California Counties. The club chapters allow for regional groups and committees, some of which have many thousands of members. These chapters further allow for special interest sections (ex. Camera, Outings), committees (conservation and political), and task forces on a single issue with some kind of geography involved. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence, including the removal and creation of Chapters, as well as recruiting and removing members. In addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for mountaineering and rock climbing in the United States. Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the Yosemite Decimal System of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake Sierra Nevada. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In California, the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as Mazamas or the Colorado Mountain Club.  Overview The Sierra Club's stated mission is \\"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\\" The Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors. Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The Executive Director runs the day-to-day operations of the group. Michael Brune, formerly of Rainforest Action Network, has served as the organization's executive director since 2010. Brune succeeded Carl Pope. Pope stepped down amid discontent that the group had strayed from its core principles. Sierra Club members belong to statewide chapters and local groups. National and local special-interest sections, committees, and task forces address particular issues. The national Sierra Club sets the organization's policy agenda and overarching rules. The club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Richard M. Skinner of the Brookings Institution describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \\"leading environmental organizations\\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.  History  Petition and map from John Muir and other founders of Sierra Club = Founding = Journalist Robert Underwood Johnson had worked with John Muir on the successful campaign to create a large Yosemite National Park surrounding the much smaller state park which had been created in 1864. This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \\"association\\" to help protect the Sierra Nevada, and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist William Keith, Willis Linn Jepson, Warren Olney, Willard Drake Johnson, Joseph LeConte and David Starr Jordan. In May 1892, the young botany professor, Willis Linn Jepson from the University of California, Berkeley helped Muir and attorney Warren Olney launched the new organization modeled after the eastern Appalachian Mountain Club. The charter members of the Sierra Club elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.Michael P. Cohen, The History of the Sierra Club, 1892‚Äì1970 (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988) The first goals of the Club included establishing Glacier and Mount Rainier national parks, convincing the California legislature to give Yosemite Valley to the U.S. federal government, and preserving coastal redwood forests of California. Muir escorted President Theodore Roosevelt through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after Yellowstone in 1872.Stephen Fox, John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125‚Äì319. In 2020, in wake of the George Floyd protests and subsequent public reconciliation of systematic racism in public history, the Sierra Club described their own early history as intermingled with racism. In particular, Muir and some of his associates, such as Joseph LeConte and David Starr Jordan, were closely related to the early eugenics movement in the United States and the early Sierra Club favored the needs of white members to the exclusion of people of color. = Hetch Hetchy controversy = Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir in Yosemite National Park, c. 1906 In the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir controversy that divided preservationists from \\"resource management\\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply. Gifford Pinchot, a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the US Forest Service, which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a referendum in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney William Edward Colby began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House. The bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the National Park Service in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. Stephen Mather, a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director. = 1920s‚Äì1940s = During the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge Sequoia National Park (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve Kings Canyon National Park (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \\"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\\" The New Deal brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of Young Turks who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys Richard Leonard and Bestor Robinson, nature photographer Ansel Adams, and David Brower. Adams sponsored Brower for membership in the club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the Sierra Club Bulletin. After World War II Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the Sierra Club Bulletin in 1946. =National reach= In 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, The Wilderness Society, and Izaak Walton League, which had long had professional staff. The Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the Echo Park Dam in Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, which had been announced by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, This Is Dinosaur was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the Colorado River project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960. The Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. = Book series = In 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with This Is the American Earth, and in 1962 In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World, with color photographs by Eliot Porter. These coffee-table books, published by their Sierra Club Books division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as In Wildness. Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors. = Grand Canyon campaign = The Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the Grand Canyon. Opposing the Bridge Canyon and Marble Canyon dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the New York Times and the Washington Post in 1966 exclaimed, \\"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\\" and asked, \\"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the Internal Revenue Service to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's 501(c)(3) status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the Sierra Club Foundation as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities. Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969. The victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \\"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\\" while \\"the Navajo Reservation\\"‚Äîwhich housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack ‚Äì \\"became increasingly industrial.\\" = End of the Brower era = Despite the club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to 501(c)(4) status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;) at Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo, California. Although the club had played the leading role blocking PG&E;'s nuclear power plant proposed for Bodega Bay, California in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby San Andreas fault, not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E;'s plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation. Eventually reconciled with the club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000. Brower resigned from the board in 2000. = McCloskey years = Michael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the club's first northwest field representative, became the club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish Redwoods National Park and North Cascades National Park. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the club's legislative activity‚Äîpreserving Alaskan lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, the Clean Air Act amendments, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, passed during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of Walter Mondale's unsuccessful campaign to unseat Ronald Reagan. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.Michael McCloskey, In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99‚Äì248. After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the California Coastal Commission, who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. Carl Pope, formerly the club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992. = Lobbying within the club = In the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts. = 21st century = In 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by Clorox, which had been named one of a \\"dangerous dozen\\" chemical companies by the Public Interest Research Group in 2004. According to Carl Pope, the Sierra Club chairman, the deal brought the club US$1.3 million over the four-year term of the contract.Louis Sahagun: Sierra Club leader departs amid discontent over group's direction Los Angeles Times, 19 November 2011. In November 2011, Sierra Club chairman Carl Pope stepped down amid discontent about the Clorox deal and other issues. Between 2007 and 2010, the Sierra Club accepted over US$25 million in donations from the gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy, a large gas drilling company involved in fracking. In January 2013, executive director Michael Brune announced that the Sierra Club would officially participate in the first civil disobedience action in its 120-year history as part of the ongoing protest calling on the Obama administration to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, stating, \\"We are watching a global crisis unfold before our eyes, and to stand aside and let it happen ‚Äì even though we know how to stop it ‚Äì would be unconscionable.\\" On 13 February 2013, Brune was arrested along with forty-eight people, including civil rights leader Julian Bond and NASA climate scientist James Hansen. In May 2015, the Sierra Club appointed its first black president of the board of directors, Aaron Mair. The Sierra Club endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Outdoor programs =Mountaineering= In 1901, William Colby organized the first Sierra Club excursion to Yosemite Valley. The annual High Trips were led by mountaineers such as Francis P. Farquhar, Joseph Nisbet LeConte, Norman Clyde, Walter A. Starr, Jr., Jules Eichorn, Glen Dawson, Ansel Adams, and David R. Brower. A number of first ascents in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding Los Angeles and throughout the West. Many major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. Norman Clyde and Jules Eichorn, considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the Sierra Nevada. Glen Dawson and Royal Robbins, often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the Tahquitz Peak area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The Yosemite Decimal System, the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz. Steve Roper's Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States. Due to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs. The club currently occasionally awards the Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award to outstanding member mountaineers. =Hiking and Outings= In World War II, a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the 10th Mountain Division. Among them was David R. Brower, who managed the High Trip program from 1947 to 1954, while serving as a major in the Army Reserve. In many areas of the country, Sierra Club also organizes hiking tours. Sierra Club's website has a \\"hiking near me\\" function. Section \\"Sierra Club Near You\\" shows all the upcoming trips in nearby area.Howard, Jeffrey. July 26, 2017. Find the Best Hiking Buddy in 1 Day: The Ultimate Guide 2017 The historic High Trips, sometimes large expeditions with more than a hundred participants and crew, have given way to smaller and more numerous excursions held across the United States and abroad. These outings form a major part of Sierra Club culture, and in some chapters, constitute the majority of member activity. Other chapters, however, may sponsor very few outdoor or recreational activities, being focused solely on political advocacy. Generally, chapters in California are much more active with regard to outdoor activities. = Sierra Club awards= Ladybug, Ready for Takeoff ‚Äì Grand Prize Winner in the Sierra Club's April 2010 Trails Photo Contest The Sierra Club presents a number of annual awards. These awards include the Sierra Club John Muir Award, which is the organization's top award. The John Muir Award is given to an individual with \\"a distinguished record of achievement in national or international conservation causes.\\" Other awards given by the Sierra Club include the Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography, which honors excellence in conservation photography; the Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award, which recognizes contributions to mountaineering, the Edgar Wayburn Award for public officials, the Rachel Carson Award for journalists and writers, the William O. Douglas Award for legal work, the EarthCare Award for international environmental protection and conservation. Policy positions =Land management= Land management, access, conservation are traditionally considered the core advocacy areas of the Sierra Club. Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands. This is particularly accentuated by the fact that the club attracts many people who primarily join the club for recreation and use of public land for hiking. Some Sierra Club members have urged the club to be more forceful in advocating for the protection of National Forests and other federally owned public lands. For example, in 2002 the club was criticized for joining with the Wilderness Society in agreeing to a compromise that would allow logging in the Black Hills in South Dakota. =Opposition to coal= A goal of the Sierra Club is to replace coal with other energy sources. Through its \\"Beyond Coal\\" campaign, the Sierra Club has set a goal to close half of all coal plants in the U.S. by 2017. American business magnate and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $50 million to the Sierra Club's anti-coal work in 2011, and announced another $30 million gift to Sierra's Beyond Coal campaign in 2015. The Beyond Coal campaign says 187 coal plants have been closed since 2010. Other funders of the Sierra Club's anti-coal campaign include the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The CEO of Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas company, donated $26 million to the Beyond Coal campaign between 2007 and 2010. The Sierra Club is also opposed to nuclear energy. =Opposition to dams= The Sierra Club opposes dams it considers inappropriate, including some government-built dams in national parks. In the early 20th century, the organization fought against the damming and flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Despite this lobbying, Congress authorized the construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam on the Tuolumne River. The Sierra Club continues to support removal of the dam. The Sierra Club advocates the decommissioning of Glen Canyon Dam and the draining of Lake Powell. The club also supports removal, breaching or decommissioning of many other dams, including four dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington. =Alliance with organized labor= The Sierra Club is a member of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups and labor unions. The BlueGreen Alliance was formed in 2006 and grew out of a less-formal collaboration between the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers. In 2012, the Laborers' International Union of North America left the coalition due to the Sierra Club and other environmental groups' opposition to the Keystone Pipeline. =Population and immigration= Immigration was historically among the most divisive issues within the club. In 1996, after years of debate, the Sierra Club adopted a neutral position on immigration levels. As the club has shifted to the left over the years, this position was amended in 2013 to support \\"an equitable path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants\\". History Although the position of the Sierra Club has generally been favorable towards immigration, some critics of the Sierra Club have charged that the efforts of some club members to restrain immigration, are a continuation of aspects of human population control and the eugenics movement. In 1969, the Sierra Club published Paul R. Ehrlich's book, The Population Bomb, in which he said that population growth was responsible for environmental decline and advocated coercive measures to reduce it. Some observers have argued that the book had a \\"racial dimension\\" in the tradition of the Eugenics movement, and that it \\"reiterated many of Osborn's jeremiads.\\" During the 1980s, some Sierra Club members, including Paul Ehrlich's wife Anne, wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of immigration to the United States. The club's position was that overpopulation was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the club to support immigration reduction. The club had previously addressed the issue of \\"mass immigration\\",\\"Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History.\\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008. and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.Kunofsky, Judy. \\"Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration.\\" Sierra Club Population Report. Spring 1989. Accessed 14 May 2008. Other Sierra Club members thought that the immigration issue was too far from the club's core environmentalist mission, and were also concerned that involvement would impair the organization's political ability to pursue its other objectives. In the mid 1990s, the club began gradually stepping away from the immigration restrictionist position, culminating with the board adopting a neutral position on immigration policy in 1996.Davila, Florangela (February 18, 2004). \\"Immigration dispute spawns factions, anger in Sierra Club\\". Seattle Times. Retrieved 2017-04-24. In 1998, 60.1% of Sierra Club voting members voted that the organization should remain neutral on America's immigration policies, while 39.2% supported a measure calling for stricter curbs on immigration to the United States. After the 1996 board policy adoption, some members who were advocates of immigration reduction organized themselves as \\"SUSPS\\", a name originally derived from \\"Sierrans for U.S. Population Stabilization\\", which now stands for \\"Support U.S. Population Stabilization.\\" SUSPS advocates a return to the Sierra Club's \\"traditional\\" (1970‚Äì1996) immigration policy stance. SUSPS has called for fully closing the borders of the United States, and for returning to immigration levels established by the Immigration Act of 1924, which includes strict ethnic quotas. David Brower also cited the club's position shift on immigration as one of the reasons for his resignation from the board in 2000. Supporters of immigration reduction within the club also charged that the board had abandoned the restrictionist position on immigration due to donations from investor David Gelbaum, who reportedly gave $200 million to the club between the mid 1990s and early 2000s and threatened Carl Pope in the mid 1990s to cease donations if they did not change their position on immigration adopted in 1988. The controversy resurfaced when a group of three immigration reduction proponents ran in the 2004 Sierra Club Board of Directors election, hoping to move the club's position away from a neutral stance on immigration, and to restore the stance previously held. Groups outside of the Club became involved, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and MoveOn. Of the three candidates, two (Frank Morris and David Pimentel), were on the board of the anti-immigration group Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America\\"Hostile takeover,\\" Intelligence Report, Spring 2004, p. 57.Potok, Mark, Editor of Intelligence Report, Letter to Larry Fahn, President, The Sierra Club, October 21, 2003.

July 15, 1966. Their candidacies were denounced by a fourth candidate, Morris Dees of the SPLC, as a \\"hostile takeover\\" attempt by \\"radical anti-immigrant activists.\\" The immigration reduction proponents won 7% of all votes cast in the election. In 2005, members voted 102,455 to 19,898 against a proposed change to \\"recognize the need to adopt lower limits on migration to the United States.\\" With the increased number of progressive activists joining the club in recent years, the Sierra Club has dramatically shifted its stance on immigration further towards the affirmative. Today, the Sierra Club supports a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, opposes a border wall and works with immigrant groups to promote environmental justice. = Controversy over housing stance = The Sierra Club has come under criticism for opposing high-density housing development projects in California, which are intended to reduce the state's housing shortage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment (CLEE) at UC Berkeley Law, said that the Sierra Club's opposition to California Senate Bill 827 - which would require cities to allow denser and taller housing near public transport centers and ease the parking requirements that cities can impose on housing developments - was \\"surprising.\\" He wrote, \\"is Sierra Club an organization of wealthy homeowners who want to keep newcomers out of their upscale, transit- rich areas? Or are they actually committed to fighting climate change by providing enough housing for Californians in low-carbon, infill areas? Because their opposition to SB 827 unfortunately indicates more of the former than the latter.\\" Affiliates and subsidiaries The Sierra Club Foundation was founded in 1960 by David R. Brower. A 501(c)(3) organization, it was founded after the Internal Revenue Service revoked the Sierra Club's tax-exempt status due to the group's political activities. The Sierra Club added its first Canadian chapter in 1963 and in 1989 opened a national office in Ottawa. Canadian affiliates of the Sierra Club operate under the Sierra Club Canada. In 1971, volunteer lawyers who had worked with the Sierra Club established the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. This was a separate organization that used the \\"Sierra Club\\" name under license from the club; it changed its name to Earthjustice in 1997. The Sierra Student Coalition (SSC) is the student-run arm of the Sierra Club. Founded by Adam Werbach in 1991, it has 30,000 members. The Sierra Club Voter Education Fund is a 527 group that became active in the 2004 Presidential election by airing television advertisements about the major party candidates' positions on environmental issues. Through the Environmental Voter Education Campaign (EVEC), the Club sought to mobilize volunteers for phone banking, door-to-door canvassing and postcard writing to emphasize these issues in the campaign. The organization maintains a publishing imprint, Sierra Club Books, publishing books on environmental issues, wilderness photographic essays, nature guides, and other related subjects. They publish the Sierra Club Calendars, perennial bestsellers, featuring photographs by well-known nature photographers such as Galen Rowell. They also publish the John Muir library, which includes many of their founder's titles. The Wilderness Travel Course is a basic mountaineering class that is administered by the Sierra Club. The Summer Program (SPROG) is a one- week leadership training program that teaches tools for environmental and social justice activism to young people across the country.  Budget and funding  The Sierra Club's annual budget was $88 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012. In 2013, the group's budget was $97.8 million. In 2008, Clorox donated $1.3 million to the Sierra Club in exchange for the right to display the Sierra Club's logo on a line of cleaning products. In February 2012, it was reported that the Sierra Club had secretly accepted over $26 million in gifts from the natural gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy. The Sierra Club used the Chesapeake Energy money for its Beyond Coal campaign to block new coal-fired power plants and close old ones. Michael Brune reported that he learned of the gifts after he succeeded Carl Pope as executive director of the Sierra Club in 2010. Brune reported that he ended the financial agreement with natural gas industry interests. In 2014, the Energy and Environment Legal Institute filed a referral with the Internal Revenue Service pointing out that Sierra Club and Sierra Club Foundation were not paying income taxes from sales of solar panels for their partners across the US. The Sierra Club has an affiliated super PAC. It spent $1,000,575 on the 2014 elections, all of it opposing Republican candidates for office. The Sierra Club is a partner of America Votes, an organization that coordinates and promotes progressive issues. Donors to the Sierra Club have included David Gelbaum, Michael Bloomberg, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The Sierra Club has also received funding from the Democracy Alliance and the Tides Foundation Advocacy Fund. In 2015, a PR front group, known as the Environmental Policy Alliance, claimed that the Sierra Club and other U.S. environmental groups received funding from groups with ties to Russia's state- owned oil company.

It became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1417, and later of Brandenburg-Prussia, and the Kingdom of Prussia. Prussia grew rapidly in the 18th and 19th century, and formed the basis of the German Empire in 1871, which survived until 1918, after the empire‚Äôs defeat in World War I. After 1900 Berlin became a major world city, known for its leadership roles in science, the humanities, music, museums, higher education, government, diplomacy and military affairs. It also had a role in manufacturing and finance. During World War II, it was virtually destroyed by bombing, artillery, and ferocious street-by-street fighting. It was split between the victors, and lost its world leadership roles. With the reunification of Germany in 1990, Berlin was restored as a capital and as a major world city. Etymology Statue of Albert the Bear (c.1100-1170) The origin of the name Berlin is uncertain. It may have roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- (\\"swamp\\"). Folk etymology connects the name to the German word for bear, B√§r. A bear also appears in the coat of arms of the city. Prehistory The oldest human traces, mainly arrowheads, in the area of later Berlin are dating to the 9th millennium BC. During Neolithic times a large number of villages existed in the area. During the Bronze Age it belonged to the Lusatian culture. For the time around 500 BC the presence of Germanic tribes can be evidenced for the first time in form of a number of villages in the higher situated areas of today's Berlin. After the Semnones left around 200 AD, the Burgundians followed. A large part of the Germanic tribes left the region around 500 AD. In the 6th century Slavic tribes, the later known Hevelli and Sprevane, reached the region. Today their traces can mainly be found at plateaus or next to waters. Their main settlements were today's Spandau and K√∂penick. No Slavic traces could be found in the city center of Berlin.Horst Ulrich et. al., Besiedlung des Berliner Raums, in: Berlin Handbuch (Berlin 1992), pp. 127‚Äì128. Emerging city (1100 ‚Äì 1400) In the 12th century the region came under German rule as part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, founded by Albert the Bear in 1157. At the end of the 12th century German merchants founded the first settlements in today's city center, called Berlin around modern Nikolaiviertel and C√∂lln, on the island in the Spree now known as the Spreeinsel or Museum Island. It is not clear which settlement is older and when they got German town rights. Berlin is mentioned as a town for the first time in 1251 and C√∂lln in 1261. The year 1237 was later taken as the year of founding. Afterwards the two settlements merged into the town of Berlin-C√∂lln; they formally merged in 1432. Albert the Bear also bequeathed to Berlin the emblem of the bear, which has appeared on its coat of arms ever since. By the year 1400 Berlin and C√∂lln had 8,000 inhabitants. A great town center fire in 1380 damaged most written records of those early years, as did the great devastation of the Thirty Years War 1618‚Äì1648.Richie, Faust's Metropolis pp 41-50 Margraviate of Brandenburg (1400 ‚Äì 1700) Map of Berlin and C√∂lln (1652, East on top) Berlin around 1688 (Drawing of 1835) The Edict of Potsdam In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. Subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and finally as German emperors. When Berlin became the residence of the Hohenzollerns, it had to give up its Hanseatic League free city status. Its main economical activity changed from trade to the production of luxurious goods for the court. *1443 to 1451: The first Berliner Stadtschloss was built on the embankment of the river Spree. **At that time Berlin-C√∂lln had about 8,000 inhabitants. Population figures rose fast, leading to poverty. *1448: The inhabitants of Berlin rebelled in the \\"Berlin Indignation\\" against the construction of a new royal palace by Elector Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. *1451: Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. *In 1510: 100 Jews were accused of stealing and desecrating hosts. 38 of them were burned to death; others were banished, losing their possessions, only to be returned by later margraves. *1530: The Tiergarten park began when Elector Joachim I donated the property for use as a royal game preserve; it was opened to the public in the mid-17th century; it ceased being a hunting park in 1740 when the job of redesigning it in the English landscape style began.Elizabeth Heekin Bartels, \\"Berlin's Tiergarten: Evolution of an Urban Park,\\" Journal of Garden History (1982) 2#2 p143+ *1539: The electors and Berlin officially became Lutheran. *1540: Joachim II introduced the Protestant Reformation in Brandenburg and secularized church possessions. He used the money to pay for his projects, like building an avenue, the Kurf√ºrstendamm, between his hunting castle Grunewald and his palace, the Berliner Stadtschloss. *1576, Bubonic plague killed about 6,000 people in the city. *Around 1600: Berlin-C√∂lln had 12,000 inhabitants. *1618 to 1648: The Thirty Years' War had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged, and the city lost half of its population. *1640: Frederick William, known as the ‚ÄúGreat Elector‚Äù, succeeded his father George William as Elector of Brandenburg. Later he initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious toleration. Over the following decades, Berlin expanded greatly in area and population with the founding of the new suburbs of Friedrichswerder and Dorotheenstadt. During his government Berlin reached 20,000 inhabitants and became significant among the cities in Central Europe for the first time. He also developed a standing army *1647: The boulevard Unter den Linden with six rows of trees was laid down between the Tiergarten park and the Palace. *1671: Fifty Jewish families from Austria were given a home in Berlin. With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William invited the French Calvinist Huguenots to Brandenburg. More than 15,000 Huguenots came, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1687 they comprise 20% of the population, and many were bankers, industrialists and investors.Alexandra Richie, Faust's Metropolis (1998) p 55 *1674 and after: The Dorotheenstadt was built in a bow of the river Spree, north-west of the Spreeinsel (Spree Island), where the Palace was situated. *1688 and after: The Friedrichstadt was built and settled. *Around 1700: Many refugees from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg had arrived. Kingdom of Prussia (1701‚Äì1871) Large coat of arms of Berlin, 1839. In 1701, Elector Frederick III (1688‚Äì1701) crowned himself as Frederick I (1701‚Äì1713), King in Prussia. He was mostly interested in decorum: he ordered the building of the castle Charlottenburg in the west of the city.Rudolf G. Scharmann, Charlottenburg Palace: Royal Prussia in Berlin (2005) He made Berlin the capital of the new kingdom of Prussia. *1709: Berlin counted 55,000 inhabitants, of whom 5,000 served in the Prussian Army. C√∂lln and Berlin were finally unified under the name of Berlin, including the suburbs of Friedrichswerder, Dorotheenstadt, and Friedrichstadt, with 60,000 inhabitants. Berlin and C√∂lln are on both sides of the river Spree, in today's Mitte borough. On 1 January 1710, the cities of Berlin, C√∂lln, Friedrichswerder, Dorotheenstadt, and Friedrichstadt were united as the ‚ÄúRoyal Capital and Residence of Berlin‚Äù. =Prussian capital= As Prussia grew, so too did Berlin, and the Kings made it the centerpiece of culture and the arts, as well as the Army. Under King Friedrich Wilhelm I (reigned 1713‚Äì40), Berlin's growth was encouraged by his determination to build a great military power. More men were needed, so he promoted immigration of Protestants from across Germany as well as France and Switzerland. He introduced universal primary education so that his soldiers could read and write. In 1720 he built the city's first major hospital and medical school, the Charit√©, now the largest teaching hospital in Europe. The city was now mainly a garrison and an armoury, for the crown heavily subsidised arms manufacturers in the capital, laying the foundations for the mechanics, engineers, technicians, and entrepreneurs who were to turn Berlin into an industrial powerhouse. The old defensive walls and moats were now useless, so they were turned down. A new customs wall (the Zoll- und Akzisemauer) was built further out, punctuated by 14 ornate gates. Inside the gates were parade grounds for Friedrich Wilhelm's soldiers: the Karree at the Brandenburg gate (now Pariserplatz), the Oktagon at the Potsdam gate (now Leipzigerplatz), the Wilhelmplatz on Wilhelmstrasse (abolished in the 1980s) and several others. In 1740, Frederick the Great (Frederick II) began his 46-year reign. He was an enlightened monarch, who patronized Enlightenment thinkers like Moses Mendelssohn. By 1755 the population reached 100,000, including 26,000 soldiers. Stagnation followed under the rule of Frederick William II, 1786-97 He had no use for the Enlightenment, but did develop innovative techniques of censorship and repression of political enemies. Napoleon captures Berlin in 1806 *1806: French troops marched into Berlin. Berlin was granted self- government and a far reaching military reform was started. *1809: The first elections for the Berlin parliament took place, in which only the well-to-do could vote. *1810: The Berlin University (now the Humboldt University) was founded. Its first rector was the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte. *1812: Jews were allowed to practice all occupations. *1814: The French were defeated in the Sixth Coalition. Economically the city was in good shape. The population grew from 200,000 to 400,000 in the first half of the 19th century, making Berlin the fourth-largest city in Europe. *1815: Battle of Waterloo with Prussian troops from Potsdam and Berlin participating. Berlin becomes part of the Province of Brandenburg. *1827: Berlin is the capital of the Province of Brandenburg from 1827‚Äì1843. *1848: As in other European cities, 1848 was a revolutionary year in Berlin. Frederick William IV (1840‚Äì1861) managed to suppress the revolution. One of his reactions was to raise the income condition to partake in the elections, with the result that only 5% of the citizens could vote. This system would stay in place until 1918. *1861: Wilhelm I (1861‚Äì1888) became the new king. In the beginning of his reign there was hope for liberalization. He appointed liberal ministers and built the city hall, Das Rote Rathaus. The appointment of Otto von Bismarck ended these hopes. =Economic growth= Train factory of August Borsig in 1847. Prussian mercantilist policies supported manufacturing enterprises and Berlin had numerous small workshops. Lacking waterpower, Berlin entrepreneurs were early pioneers in the use of steam engines after 1815. Textiles, clothing, farm equipment, railway gear, chemicals and machinery were especially important; electrical machinery became important after 1880. Berlin's central position after 1850 in the fast-growing German railway network facilitated the supply of raw materials and distribution of manufactures. As the administrative role of the Prussian state grew, so did the highly efficient, well-trained civil service. The bureaucracy and military expanded even faster when Berlin became the capital of unified Germany in 1871. the population grew rapidly, from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 in 1870. In 1861, outlying industrial suburbs such as Wedding, Moabit, and several others were incorporated into the city. =Religion= By 1900 about 85% of the people were classified as Protestants, 10% as Roman Catholics and 5% as Jews. Berlin's middle and upper classes were generally devout Protestants. The working classes increasingly became secularized. When workers moved to Berlin the Protestants among them largely abandoned the religious practices of their old villages. The labor unions promoted anticlericalism, and denounced the Protestant churches as aloof from the needs of the working class. However, the Catholic workers remained somewhat closer to their traditional churches, which featured liturgies that were more appealing to workers than wordy intellectual sermons at the Protestant churches. Adult attendance at Sunday church services in the early 20th century was 6% in Berlin, compared to 22% in London and 37% in New York.Hugh McLeod, Piety and Poverty: Working-class Religion in Berlin, London and New York 1870-1914 (1996) =Berlin Romanticism= The phase of German Romanticism after Jena Romanticism is often called Berlin Romanticism (see also Heidelberg Romanticism). Notable representatives of the movement include Friedrich Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Alexander von Humboldt.Helmut Thielicke, Modern Faith and Thought, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1990, p. 174. German Empire (1871‚Äì1918) =Imperial capital= After the quick victory of an alliance of German states over France in the 1870 war, the German Empire was established in 1871. Bismarck had fought and succeeded in leaving out Austria, Prussia's long standing competitor, and Prussia became the largest and by far most influential state in the new German Empire, and in turn Germany became the most powerful nation in Europe. Wilhelm I became emperor (\\"Kaiser\\"). Bismarck became Chancellor and made Berlin the center of European power politics. The imperial government and the military establishment expanded dramatically, bringing together the landed junker nobility, the rich bankers and industrialists, and the most talented scientists and scholars. In 1884 came the parliament building, the Reichstag.Gerhard Masur, Imperial Berlin (1990) Municipal government was handled in two parts. The ministry of police reported to the Prussian government and took control of crime, markets, and fire fighting. The civil government had a mayor appointed by the city council. It comprised 144 members elected in 48 wards by universal manhood suffrage. It handled the water supply and sanitation, streets, hospitals and charitable operations and schools.\\"Berlin\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\" (1910) Berlin in 1905 click 3x to enlarge In 1870, the sanitary conditions in Berlin were among the worst in Europe. August Bebel recalled conditions before a modern sewer system was built in the late 1870s: :\\"Waste-water from the houses collected in the gutters running alongside the curbs and emitted a truly fearsome smell. There were no public toilets in the streets or squares. Visitors, especially women, often became desperate when nature called. In the public buildings the sanitary facilities were unbelievably primitive....As a metropolis, Berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after 1870.\\"Cited in David Clay Large, Berlin (2000) pp 17-18 Berlin in 1912. The primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital, and the Imperial government brought in its scientists, engineers and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies but to forge the world's model city. A British expert in 1906 concluded that Berlin represented \\"the most complete application of science, order and method of public life,\\" adding \\"it is a marvel of civic administration, the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is.\\" In the meantime, Berlin had become an industrial city with 800,000 inhabitants. Improvements to the infrastructure were needed; in 1896 the construction of the subway (U-Bahn) began and was completed in 1902. The neighborhoods around the city center (including Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain and Wedding) were filled with tenement blocks. The surroundings saw extensive development of industrial areas East of Berlin and wealthy residential areas in the South-West. In terms of high culture, museums were being built and enlarged, and Berlin was on the verge of becoming a major musical city. Berlin dominated the German theater scene, with the government- supported Opernhaus and Schauspielhaus, as well as numerous private playhouses included the Lessing and the Deutsches theatres. They featured the modern plays of Ernst von Wildenbruch, Hermann Sudermann, and Gerhart Hauptmann. who managed to work around the puritanical censorship imposed by the Berlin police. =Labour unions= Berlin, with its large numbers of industrial workers by 1871 became the headquarters for most of the national labor organizations, and the favorite meeting place for labor intellectuals. Inside the city, the unions had a turbulent history. The conservative aftermath of the Revolution of 1848 drained their strength, and internal bickering was characteristic of the 1850s and 1860s. Many locals were under the control of reformist, bourgeois leaders who competed with each other and had a negative view of Marxism and socialist internationalist. They concentrated on wages, hours and control the workplace, and gave little support to nationalist organizations such as the Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein (ADAV) founded in 1863. By the 1870s, however, the Lassallean ADAV finally gained strength; it joined together with the Social Democratic Worker's Party (SDAP) in 1874. Henceforth the city's labor movement supported radical socialism and gained preeminence within the German labor movement. Germany had universal manhood suffrage after 1871, but the government was controlled by hostile forces, and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck tried to undermine or destroy the union movement.Carl E. Schorske, German social democracy, 1905-1917: The development of the Great Schism (1955) =First World War= The \\"spirit of 1914\\" was the overwhelming, enthusiastic support of all elements of the population for war in 1914. In the Reichstag, the vote for credits was unanimous, with all the Socialists joining in. One professor testified to a \\"great single feeling of moral elevation of soaring of religious sentiment, in short, the ascent of a whole people to the heights.\\"Roger Chickening, Imperial Germany and the World War, 1914‚Äì1918 (1998) p. 14 At the same time, there was a level of anxiety; most commentators predicted the short victorious war ‚Äì but that hope was dashed in a matter of weeks, as the invasion of Belgium bogged down and the French Army held in front of Paris. The Western Front became a killing machine, as neither army moved more than a ten thousand yards at a time. There had been no preparations before the war, and no stockpiles of essential goods. Industry was in chaos, unemployment soared while it took months to reconvert to munitions productions. In 1916, the Hindenburg Program called for the mobilization of all economic resources to produce artillery, shells, and machine guns. Church bells and copper roofs were ripped out and melted down.Richie, Faust's Metropolis pp 272-75 Conditions on the homefront worsened month by month, for the British blockade of Germany cut off supplies of essential raw materials and foodstuffs, while the conscription of so many farmers (and horses) reduced the food supply. Likewise, the drafting of miners reduced the main energy source, coal. The textile factories produced Army uniforms, and warm clothing for civilians ran short. The device of using ersatz materials, such as paper and cardboard for cloth and leather proved unsatisfactory. Soap was in short supply, as was hot water. Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink but using the slogan of \\"sharing scarcity\\" the Berlin bureaucracy ran an efficient rationing system nevertheless.Keith Allen, \\"Sharing scarcity: Bread rationing and the First World War in Berlin, 1914-1923,\\" Journal of Social History, (Winter 1998) 32#2 pp 371-93 in JSTOR The food supply increasingly focused on potatoes and bread as it was harder and harder to buy meat. Rationing was installed, and soup kitchens were opened. The meat ration in late 1916 was only 31% of peacetime, and it fell to 12% in late 1918. The fish ration was 51% in 1916, and none at all by late 1917. The rations for cheese, butter, rice, cereals, eggs and lard were less than 20% of peacetime levels.David Welch, Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914-1918 (2000) p.122 In 1917 the harvest was poor, and the potato supply ran short, and Germans substituted almost inedible turnips; the \\"turnip winter\\" of 1917-18 was remembered with bitter distaste for generations.Chickering, Imperial Germany pp 140-145 German women were not employed in the Army, but large numbers took paid employment in industry and factories, and even larger numbers engaged in volunteer services. Housewives were taught how to cook without milk, eggs or fat; agencies helped widows find work. Banks, insurance companies and government offices for the first time hired women for clerical positions. Factories hired them for unskilled labor ‚Äì by December 1917, half the workers in chemicals, metals, and machine tools were women. Laws protecting women in the workplace were relaxed, and factories set up canteens to provide food for their workers, lest their productivity fall off. The food situation in 1918 was better, because the harvest was better, but serious shortages continued, with high prices, and a complete lack of condiments and fresh fruit. Many migrants had flocked into Berlin to work in industry and the government ministries, which made for overcrowded housing. Reduced coal supplies left everyone in the cold. Daily life involved long working hours, poor health, and little or no recreation, as well as increasing anxiety for the safety of loved ones in the Army and in prisoner of war camps. The men who returned from the front were those who had been permanently crippled; wounded soldiers who recovered were sent back to the trenches.Richie, Faust's Metropolis pp 277-80 Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933) Pre-1920 municipal limits of the City of Berlin (dark red) within the extended city area of Greater Berlin (light red) At the end of World War I, monarchy and aristocracy was overthrown and Germany became a republic, known as the Weimar Republic. Berlin remained the capital, but faced a series of threats from the far left and far right. In late 1918 politicians inspired by the Communist Revolution in Russia founded the Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD). In January 1919 it tried to seize power in the Spartacist revolt). The coup failed and at the end of the month right-wing Freikorps forces killed the Communist leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. In March 1920 Wolfgang Kapp, founder of the right wing German Fatherland Party (Deutsche Vaterlands-Partei), tried to bring down the government. The Berlin garrison chose his side, and the government buildings were occupied (the government had already left Berlin). A general strike stopped the putsch being successful. On October 1, 1920: The Greater Berlin Act created \\"Greater Berlin\\" (Gro√ü-Berlin) by incorporating several neighboring towns and villages like Charlottenburg, K√∂penick or Spandau from the Province of Brandenburg into the city; Berlin's population doubled overnight from about 2 to nearly 4 million inhabitants. In 1922: The foreign minister Walther Rathenau was murdered in Berlin, and half a million people attended his funeral. The economic situation was bad. Germany owed reparation money after the Treaty of Versailles. The sums were reduced and paid using loans from New York banks. In response to French occupation, the government reacted by printing so much money that inflation was enormous. Especially pensioners lost their savings; everyone else lost their debts. At the worst point of the inflation one dollar was worth about 4.2 trillion marks. From 1924 onwards the situation became better because of newly arranged agreements with the allied forces, American help, and a sounder fiscal policy. The heyday of Berlin began. It became the largest industrial city of the continent. People like the architect Walter Gropius, physicist Albert Einstein, painter George Grosz and writers Arnold Zweig, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Tucholsky made Berlin one of the major cultural centers of Europe. Brecht spent his last years in the Weimar-era Berlin (1930‚Äì1933) working with his ‚Äòcollective‚Äô on the Lehrst√ºcke. Night life bloomed in 1920s Berlin. In 1922, the railway system, that connected Berlin to its neighboring cities and villages was electrified and transformed into the S-Bahn, and a year later Tempelhof airport was opened. Berlin was the second biggest inland harbor of the country. All this infrastructure was needed to transport and feed the over 4 million Berliners. Before the 1929 crash, 450,000 people were unemployed. In the same year the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) won its first seats in the city parliament. Nazi Propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels became Gauleiter (party district leader) of Berlin in 1926. On July 20, 1932, the Prussian government under Otto Braun in Berlin was dismissed by presidential decree. The republic was nearing its breakdown, under attack by extreme forces from the right and the left. On January 30, 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì1945) By 1931, the Great Depression had severely damaged the city's economy. Politics were in chaos, as militias controlled by the Nazis and the Communists fought for control of the streets. President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor in January 1933, and the Nazis quickly moved to take complete control of the entire nation. On February 27, 1933, a left-wing radical was alleged to have set afire the Reichstag building (a fire which was later believed to have been set by the Nazis themselves); the fire gave Hitler the opportunity to set aside the constitution. Tens of thousands of political opponents fled into exile or were imprisoned. All civic organizations, except the churches, came under Nazi control. Around 1933, some 160,000 Jews were living in Berlin: one third of all German Jews, 4% of the Berlin population. A third of them were poor immigrants from Eastern Europe, who lived mainly in the Scheunenviertel near Alexanderplatz. The Jews were persecuted from the beginning of the Nazi regime. In March, all Jewish doctors had to leave the Charit√© hospital. In the first week of April, Nazi officials ordered the German population not to buy from Jewish shops. The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin and used as a showcase for Nazi Germany (though the Games had been given to Germany before 1933). In order to not alienate the foreign visitors, the \\"forbidden for Jews\\" signs were temporarily removed. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which numbered 160,000 before the Nazis came to power. After the pogrom of Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned. Around 1939, there were still 75,000 Jews living in Berlin. The majority of German Jews in Berlin were taken to the Grunewald railway station in early 1943 and shipped in stock cars to death camps such as the Auschwitz, where most were murdered in the Holocaust. Only some 1200 Jews survived in Berlin by hiding. Approximately 800 Jews survived in Berlin's Jewish Hospital. Causes for their survival include bureaucratic infighting, hospital director Dr. Walter Lustig's relationship with Adolf Eichmann, the Nazis' bizarre system for classifying persons of partly Jewish ancestry, German leader Adolf Hitler's ambivalence about how to handle Jews of German descent, and the fact that the Nazis needed a place to treat Jews.Daniel B. Silver, \\"REFUGE IN HELL: How Berlin's Jewish Hospital Outlasted the Nazis\\" (2004) Thirty kilometers () northwest of Berlin, near Oranienburg, was Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where mainly political opponents and Russian prisoners of war were incarcerated. Tens of thousands died there. Sachsenhausen had subcamps near industries, where the prisoners had to work. Many of these camps were in Berlin. =Nazi plans= In the late 1930s Hitler and his architect Albert Speer made plans for the new Berlin‚Äîa world city or Welthauptstadt Germania.Roger Moorhouse, \\"Germania,\\" History Today (March 2012), 62#3 pp 20-25 All the projects were to be of gigantic size. Adjacent to the Reichstag, Speer planned to construct the Volkshalle (The People's Hall), 250 m high, with an enormous copper dome. It would be large enough to hold 170,000 people. From the People's Hall, a southbound avenue was planned, the Avenue of Victory, 23 m wide and long. At the other end there would have been the new railway station, and next to it Tempelhof Airport. Halfway down the avenue there would have been a huge arch 117 m high, commemorating those fallen during the world wars. With the completion of these projects (planned for 1950), Berlin was to be renamed \\"Germania.\\"Richie, Faust's Metropolis, pp 470-73 The war postponed all construction, as the city instead built giant concrete towers as bases for anti-aircraft guns. Today only a few structures remain from the Nazi era, such as the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (National Ministry of Aviation), Tempelhof International Airport, and Olympiastadion. Hitler's Reich Chancellery was demolished by Soviet occupation authorities. =Second World War= US Air Force photographs the destruction in central Berlin in July 1945 Initially Berlin was at the extreme range of British bombers and attacks had to be made in clear skies during summer, increasing the risk to the attackers. Better bombers came into service in 1942 but most of the British bombing effort that year was spent in support of the Battle of the Atlantic against German submarines. *1940: A token British air-raid on Berlin; Hitler responds by ordering the Blitz on London. *1943: Polish resistance group ' successfully carries out a series of small bomb attacks.Dunkle Welten: Bunker, Tunnel und Gew√∂lbe unter Berlin, Dietmar Arnold, Frieder Salm, page 120, 2007 *1943: The USAAF strategic bombing force began operations against Berlin. The RAF focused their strategic bombing efforts on Berlin in their \\"Battle of Berlin\\" from November. It was halted at the end of March 1944, after 16 mass bombing raids on the capital, due to unacceptable losses of aircraft and crew. By that point about half a million had been made homeless but morale and production was unaffected. About a quarter of the city's population was evacuated. Raids on major German cities grew in scope and raids of over 1,000 4-engined bombers were not uncommon by 1944. (On March 18, 1945 alone, for example, 1,250 American bombers attacked the city). *1944: USAAF bombing switched to forcing encounters with the German air force so that it could be defeated by the bombers' fighter escorts. Attacks on Berlin ensured a response from the Luftwaffe, drawing it into a battle where their losses could not be replaced at the same rate as the Allies. RAF focus switched to preparations for the invasion of France but Berlin was still subjected to regular nuisance and diversionary raids by the RAF. *March 1945: The RAF begins 36 consecutive nights of bombing by its fast de Havilland Mosquito medium bombers (from around 40 to 80 each night). British bombers dropped 46,000 tons of bombs; the Americans dropped 23,000 tons. By May 1945, 1.7 million people (40%) had fled.Richard Overy, The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940-1945 (2014) pp 301, 304 *April 1945: Berlin was the main objective for Allied armies. The Race to Berlin refers to the competition of Allied generals during the final months of World War II to enter Berlin first. U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower halted Anglo-American troops on the Elbe River, primarily because the Soviets made their capture of the city a high national priority in terms of prestige and revenge. The Red Army converged on Berlin with several Fronts (Army Groups). Hitler remained in supreme command and imagined that rescue armies were on the way; he refused to consider surrender. The Battle of Berlin itself has been well chronicled.Richie, Faust's Metropolis, pp 547-603; A. Beevor, The Fall of Berlin (2003) excerpt; Cornelius Ryan, The Last Battle (1966) excerpt; Earl Ziemke Battle for Berlin: End of the Third Reich (1968); Karl Bahm Berlin 1945: The Final Reckoning (2001) excerpt; Peter Antill and Peter Dennis, Berlin 1945: End of the Thousand Year Reich (2005) excerpt *April 30, 1945: Hitler committed suicide in the F√ºhrerbunker underneath the Reich Chancellery. Resistance continued, though most of the city was in Soviet hands by that point. *May 2, 1945: Berlin finally capitulated. * Hundreds of thousands of women were subjected to rape by Soviet soldiers.The anonymous (revealed in 2003 to be journalist Marta Hillers) A Woman in Berlin () is a harrowing personal account of survival. Destruction of buildings and infrastructure was nearly total in parts of the inner city business and residential sectors. The outlying sections suffered relatively little damage. This averages to one fifth of all buildings, and 50% in the inner city. West and East Germany (1945‚Äì1990) By war's end up to a third of Berlin had been destroyed by concerted Allied air raids, Soviet artillery, and street fighting. The so- called Stunde Null‚Äîzero hour‚Äîmarked a new beginning for the city. Greater Berlin was divided into four sectors by the Allies under the London Protocol of 1944, as follows: The occupied sectors of Berlin * the American sector (210.8 km2Steinberg p. 1063), consisting of the boroughs of Neuk√∂lln, Kreuzberg, Tempelhof, Sch√∂neberg, Steglitz, and Zehlendorf; (see: commandants of Berlin American Sector) * the British sector (165.5 km2), consisting of the boroughs of Tiergarten, Charlottenburg, Wilmersdorf, and Spandau; (see: commandants of Berlin British Sector) * the French sector (110.8 km2), consisting of the boroughs of Wedding and Reinickendorf; (See: commandants of Berlin French Sector) * the Soviet sector (402.8 km2)), consisting of the boroughs of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Wei√üensee, Friedrichshain, Lichtenberg, Treptow, and K√∂penick; (see: commandants of Berlin Soviet Sector). Footage of Berlin (1961). The Soviet victors of the Battle of Berlin immediately occupied all of Berlin. They handed the American, British and French sectors (later known as West Berlin) to the American and British Forces in July 1945: the French occupied their sector later. Berlin remained divided until reunification in 1990.Philip Broadbent and Sabine Hake, eds. Berlin: Divided City, 1945-1989 (Berghahn Books; 2010) The Soviets used the period from May 1945 to July 1945 to dismantle industry, transport and other facilities in West Berlin, including removing railway tracks, as reparations for German war damage in the Soviet Union. This practice continued in East Berlin and the Soviet occupation zone after 1945. Conditions were harsh, and hundreds of thousands of refugees from the east kept pouring in. Residents depended heavily on the black market for food and other necessities.Paul Steege, Black Market, Cold War: Everyday Life in Berlin, 1946-1949 (2008) Berlin's unique situation as a city half-controlled by Western forces in the middle of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany made it a natural focal point in the Cold War after 1947. Though the city was initially governed by a Four Power Allied Control Council with a leadership that rotated monthly, the Soviets withdrew from the council as east‚Äìwest relations deteriorated and began governing their sector independently. The council continued to govern West Berlin, with the same rotating leadership policy, though now only involving France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. East Germany chose East Berlin as its capital when the country was formed out of the Soviet occupation zone in October 1949; however, this was rejected by Western allies, who continued to regard Berlin as an occupied city that was not legally part of any German state. In practice, the government of East Germany treated East Berlin as an integral part of the nation. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center. By the establishment of the Oder-Neisse line and the complete expulsion of the German inhabitants east of this line, Berlin lost its traditional hinterlands of Farther Pomerania and Lower Silesia. West Germany, formed on 23 May 1949 from the American, British, and French zones, had its seat of government and de facto capital in Bonn, although Berlin was symbolically named the de jure West German capital in West German Basic Law (Grundgesetz). West Berlin de jure remained under the rule of the Western Allies, but for most practical purposes was treated as a part of West Germany; however the residents did not hold West German passports. =Blockade and airlift= Berliners watching a C-54 land at Tempelhof Airport (1948) In response to Allied efforts to fuse the American, French, and British sectors of western Germany into a federal state, and to a currency reform undertaken by Western powers without Soviet approval, the Soviets blocked ground access to West Berlin on 26 June 1948, in what became known as the \\"Berlin Blockade\\". The Soviet goal was to gain control of the whole of Berlin. The American and British air forces engaged in a massive logistical effort to supply the western sectors of the city through the Berlin Airlift, known by West Berliners as \\"die Luftbr√ºcke\\" (the Air Bridge). The blockade lasted almost a year, ending when the Soviets once again allowed ground access to West Berlin on 11 May 1949. The Blockade and Airlift were iconic events in the early history of the Cold War, and made a profound impression on Berliners as to who their friends and their enemies were.Daniel F. Harrington, Berlin on the Brink: The Blockade, the Airlift, and the Early Cold War (2012) As part of this project, US Army engineers expanded Tempelhof Airport. Because sometimes the deliveries contained sweets and candy for children, the planes were also nicknamed \\"Candy Bombers\\".Andrei Cherny, Candy Bombers: The Untold Story of the Berlin Airlift and America's Finest Hour (2008) =The June 17 Uprising= With Stalin dead, the KGB chief Lavrenti Beria jockeyed for power in the Kremlin, putting forth the goal of German reunification. His plan was to set up a workers' demonstration that would allow the Kremlin to remove hardliner Walter Ulbricht and begin a program of economic concessions to the workers. The plan failed when the demonstrations assumed a mass character. The strike against poor wages and working conditions overnight became a workers' revolution for democratic rights. On 17 June, the Soviets used their tanks to restore order. This failure delayed German unification and contributed to the fall of Beria. It started when 60 construction workers building the showpiece Stalin-Allee in East Berlin went on strike on 16 June 1953, to demand a reduction in recent work-quota increases. They called for a general strike the next day, 17 June. The general strike and protest marches turned into rioting and spread throughout East Germany. The East German police failed to quell the unrest. It was forcibly suppressed by Soviet troops, who encountered stiff resistance from angry crowds across East Germany, and responded with live ammunition. At least 153 people were killed in the suppression of the uprising.Jonathan Sperber, \\"17 June 1953: Revisiting a German Revolution\\" German History (2004) 22#4 pp 619-643. The continuation of the street \\"Unter den Linden\\" on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate was renamed Stra√üe des 17. Juni in honor of the uprising, and 17 June was proclaimed a national holiday in West Germany. The 50th anniversary of 17 June 1953 in 2003 was marked by reflection on the role of memory in creating a national identity for a unified Germany. =Berlin Wall= East German construction workers building the Berlin Wall, 1961-11-20. Those trying to cross the so-called death strip on the eastern side could be shot. Loshitzky depicts the role of the Berlin Wall as a symbol of the Cold War, d√©tente, and the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. She divides the history of the Wall into six major stages: the erection of the Wall (1961); the period of the \\"geography of fear\\" from the Cold War; the period of d√©tente; the short period of glasnost and perestroika; the fall of the Wall (1989); and after the Wall.Yosefa Loshitzky, \\"Constructing and deconstructing the wall,\\" Clio (1997) 26#3 pp 275-296 On August 13, 1961 the Communist East German government started to build a wall, physically separating West Berlin from East Berlin and the rest of East Germany, as a response to massive numbers of East German citizens fleeing into West Berlin as a way to escape. The wall was built overnight with no warning. This separated families for as long as the wall was up. The East German government called the Wall the \\"anti-fascist protection wall\\". The tensions between East and West were exacerbated by a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now a de facto part of West Germany, but with a unique legal status, while East Berlin remained part of East Germany. Soviet tanks face U.S. tanks at Checkpoint Charlie The eastern and western sectors of Berlin were now completely separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. During the Wall's existence there were around 5,000 successful escapes into West Berlin; 136 people were officially killed trying to cross (see List of deaths at the Berlin Wall) and around 200 were seriously injured. The sandy soil under the Wall was both a blessing and a curse for those who attempted to tunnel their way to West Berlin and freedom. Although it was easy to dig through quickly, it was also more prone to collapse. Ich bin ein Berliner speech from the Rathaus Sch√∂neberg by John F. Kennedy, June 26, 1963 When the first stone blocks were laid down at Potsdamer Platz in the early hours of August 13, US troops stood ready with ammunition and watched the wall being built, stone by stone. The US military with West Berlin police kept Berliners 300 meters away from the border. President John F. Kennedy and the United States Congress decided not to interfere and risk armed conflict, but sent protest notes to Moscow. Massive demonstrations took place in West Berlin. John F. Kennedy gave a speech about the Berlin Wall in which he said, \\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\" ‚Äì \\"I am a Berliner\\" ‚Äì which meant much to a city that was a Western island in Soviet satellite territory. Much Cold War espionage and counter-espionage took place in Berlin, against a backdrop of potential superpower confrontation in which both sides had nuclear weapons set for a range that could hit Germany. In 1971, the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin was signed. While the Soviet Union applied the oversight of the four powers only to West Berlin, the Western Allies emphasized in a 1975 note to the United Nations their position that four-power oversight applied to Berlin as a whole. The agreement guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes. As many businesses did not want to operate in West Berlin due to its physical and economic isolation from the outside, the West German government subsidized any businesses that did operate in West Berlin. =Student movement= May 1968 student protest at the Architecture Building at Berlin Institute of Technology, in protest against the adoption of the German Emergency Acts. In the 1960s, West Berlin became one of the centers of the German student movement. West Berlin was especially popular with young German left-wing radicals, as young men living in West Berlin were exempted from the obligatory military service required in West Germany proper: the Kreuzberg district became especially well known for its high concentration of young radicals. The Wall afforded unique opportunities for social gatherings. The physical wall was set some distance behind the actual sector border, up to several meters behind in some places. The West Berlin police were not legally allowed to enter the space between the border and the wall, as it was technically in East Berlin and outside their jurisdiction: many people took the opportunity to throw loud parties in this space, with the West Berlin authorities powerless to intervene. In 1968 and after, West Berlin became one of the centers of the student revolt; in particular, the Kreuzberg borough was the center of many riots.Richie, Faust's Metropolis (1998) pp 777-80 =750th anniversary= File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0926-040, Berlin, 750-Jahr-Feier, Logo.jpgLogo commemorating Berlin's 750th anniversary.

On 9 November 1989, border guards allowed crowds from East Berlin to cross the frontier at the B√∂sebr√ºcke. The guards believed that the authorities had decided to open the wall, but in reality no firm decision was taken and events gathered steam on their own. People of East and West Berlin climbed up and danced on the wall at the Brandenburg Gate in scenes of wild celebration broadcast worldwide. This time no Soviet tanks rolled through Berlin. The wall never closed again, and was soon on its way to demolition, with countless Berliners and tourists wielding hammers and chisels to secure souvenir chunks. On Christmas Day December 25, 1989, the American conductor Leonard Bernstein shared with East and West Berliners and the world his Berlin Celebration Concert in order to celebrate the Fall of the Berlin Wall. \\"Ode to Joy\\", which Bernstein had reworded \\"Ode to Freedom\\", was performed. =Capital and world city= After the fall of Communism in Europe, on 3 October 1990 Germany and Berlin were both reunited. By then the Wall had been almost completely demolished, with only small sections remaining. In June 1991 the German Parliament, the Bundestag, voted to move the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin. The decision was reached after 10 hours of debate. In the voting Berlin won by a narrow margin: 338 for, 320 against. Berlin once more became the capital of a unified Germany. In 1999 federal ministries and government offices moved back from Bonn to Berlin, but most employees in the ministries still work in Bonn. Also in 1999, about 20 government authorities moved from Bonn to Berlin, as planned in the compensation agreement of 1994, the Berlin/Bonn Act. Berlin has been targeted by terrorists on several occasions; the most severe incident being a vehicle-ramming attack in 2016. In the 21st century Berlin has become a global city for international affairs, young business founders, creative industries, higher education services, corporate research, popular media and diverse cultural tourism. Population-wise, Berlin became one of the most rapidly growing urban centers in Europe after 2010, much of which has been due to immigration.

They sense the blood pressure and relay the information to the brain, so that a proper blood pressure can be maintained. Baroreceptors are a type of mechanoreceptor sensory neuron that are excited by a stretch of the blood vessel. Thus, increases in the pressure of blood vessel triggers increased action potential generation rates and provides information to the central nervous system. This sensory information is used primarily in autonomic reflexes that in turn influence the heart cardiac output and vascular smooth muscle to influence total peripheral resistance. Baroreceptors act immediately as part of a negative feedback system called the baroreflex,Stanfield, CL; Germann, WJ. (2008) Principles of Human Physiology, Pearson Benjamin Cummings. 3rd edition, pp.427. as soon as there is a change from the usual mean arterial blood pressure, returning the pressure toward a normal level. These reflexes help regulate short-term blood pressure. The solitary nucleus in the medulla oblongata of the brain recognizes changes in the firing rate of action potentials from the baroreceptors, and influences cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Baroreceptors can be divided into two categories based on the type of blood vessel in which they are located: high-pressure arterial baroreceptors and low-pressure baroreceptors (also known as cardiopulmonaryLevy, MN; Pappano, AJ. (2007) Cardiovascular Physiology, Mosby Elsevier. 9th edition, pp.172. or volume receptorsStanfield, CL; Germann, WJ. (2008) Principles of Human Physiology, Pearson Benjamin Cummings. 3rd edition, pp.430-431.). Arterial baroreceptors Arterial baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are stimulated by distortion of the arterial wall when pressure changes. The baroreceptors can identify the changes in both the average blood pressure or the rate of change in pressure with each arterial pulse. Action potentials triggered in the baroreceptor ending are then directly conducted to the brainstem where central terminations (synapses) transmit this information to neurons within the solitary nucleus which lies in the medulla. Reflex responses from such baroreceptor activity can trigger increases or decreases in the heart rate. Arterial baroreceptor sensory endings are simple, splayed nerve endings that lie in the tunica adventitia of the artery. An increase in the mean arterial pressure increases depolarization of these sensory endings, which results in action potentials. These action potentials are conducted to the solitary nucleus in the central nervous system by axons and have a reflex effect on the cardiovascular system through autonomic neurons.Stanfield, CL; Germann, WJ. (2008) Principles of Human Physiology, Pearson Benjamin Cummings. 3rd edition, pp.424-425. Hormone secretions that target the heart and blood vessels are affected by the stimulation of baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, baroreceptors discharge with each heart beat. If blood pressure falls, such as on orthostatic hypotension or in hypovolaemic shock, baroreceptor firing rate decreases and baroreceptor reflexes act to help restore blood pressure by increasing heart rate. Signals from the carotid baroreceptors are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). Signals from the aortic baroreceptors travel through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).Bray, JJ; Cragg, PA; Macknight, ADC; Mills, RG. (1999) Lecture Notes on Human Physiology, Blackwell Publishing. 4th edition, pp.379. Carotid sinus baroreceptors are responsive to both increases or decreases in arterial pressure, while aortic arch baroreceptors are only responsive to increases in arterial pressure. Arterial baroreceptors inform reflexes about arterial blood pressure but other stretch receptors in the large veins and right atrium convey information about the low pressure parts of the circulatory system. Baroreceptors respond very quickly to maintain a stable blood pressure, but their responses diminish with time and thus are most effective for conveying short term changes in blood pressure. In people with essential hypertension the baroreceptors and their reflexes change and function to maintain the elevated blood pressure as if normal. The receptors then become less sensitive to change.Levy, MN; Pappano, AJ. (2007) Cardiovascular Physiology, Mosby Elsevier. 9th edition, pp.171. Electrical stimulation of baroreceptors has been found to activate the baroreflex, reducing sympathetic tone throughout the body and thereby reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. Low-pressure baroreceptors The low-pressure baroreceptors, are found in large systemic veins, in pulmonary vessels, and in the walls of the right atrium and ventricles of the heart (the atrial volume receptors). The low-pressure baroreceptors are involved with the regulation of blood volume. The blood volume determines the mean pressure throughout the system, in particular in the venous side where most of the blood is held. The low- pressure baroreceptors have both circulatory and renal effects; they produce changes in hormone secretion, resulting in profound effects on the retention of salt and water; they also influence intake of salt and water. The renal effects allow the receptors to change the mean pressure in the system in the long term. Denervating these receptors 'fools' the body into thinking that it has too low blood volume and initiates mechanisms that retain fluid and so push up the blood pressure to a higher level than it would otherwise have. Baroreceptor dysfunction Baroreceptors are integral to the body's function: Pressure changes in the blood vessels would not be detected as quickly in the absence of baroreceptors. When baroreceptors are not working, blood pressure continues to increase, but, within an hour, the blood pressure returns to normal as other blood pressure regulatory systems take over. Baroreceptors can also become oversensitive in some people (usually the carotid baroreceptors in older males). This can lead to bradycardia, dizziness and fainting (syncope) from touching the neck (often whilst shaving). This is an important cause to exclude in men having pre-syncope or syncope symptoms.

He is remembered for his role as Chief Inspector Hubbard in Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder, as the chauffeur in Billy Wilder's Sabrina (both 1954), and as the second \\"Mr. French\\" on TV's Family Affair in its first season (1967). Life and work Born in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, England, in 1903, Williams was educated at Lancing College. He began his acting career on the English stage in 1916, appearing in J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, Frances Nordstrom's The Ruined Lady, and Frederick Lonsdale's The Fake.\\"John Williams Is Dead at 80; Stage, Screen and TV Actor\\", New York Times, 8 May 1983. Retrieved 3 August 2017. In 1924 Williams moved to New York, where he was cast in a series of successful Broadway productions. He would appear in over 30 Broadway plays over the next four decades, performing on stage with performers such as Claudette Colbert in Clifford Grey's A Kiss in the Taxi in 1925, Helen Hayes in J. M. Barrie's Alice Sit-by-the-Fire and Gertrude Lawrence in George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion in 1946. In 1953, Williams won a Tony Award for Actor, Supporting or Featured (Dramatic) for his role as Chief Inspector Hubbard in Frederick Knott's Dial M for Murder on Broadway. Soon afterwards, when Alfred Hitchcock adapted the play to a film version released in 1954, he cast Williams in the same role. Williams reprised his Broadway role in Dial M for Murder for a 1958 Hallmark Hall of Fame television presentation. Also pictured are Maurice Evans and Rosemary Harris. Williams' first appearance in a Hollywood film was in director Mack Sennett's short The Chumps (1930). He ultimately appeared in more than 40 films, including two other Hitchcock films: The Paradine Case (1947) starring Gregory Peck, in which Williams held a minor role as a barrister, and To Catch a Thief (1955) with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, in which Williams portrayed a major character‚Äîa Lloyd's of London insurance representative. Williams also made more than 40 guest appearances on television shows. He played in several episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents including: \\"The Long Shot\\" (1955), \\"Back for Christmas\\" (1956), \\"Whodunit\\" (1956), \\"Wet Saturday\\" (1956), \\"The Rose Garden\\" (1956), the three-part episode \\"I Killed the Count\\" (1957), \\"The Three Dreams of Mr. Findlater\\" (1957), and \\"Banquo‚Äôs Chair\\" (1959). Three of these episodes, \\"Back for Christmas\\", \\"Wet Saturday\\", and \\"Banquo‚Äôs Chair\\", were directed by Hitchcock himself. Williams played William Shakespeare in The Twilight Zone episode \\"The Bard\\" (1963) and guest-starred on the sitcom My Three Sons (also 1963), portraying a stuffy, very precise English butler. In the latter role he was clean shaven, not sporting his customary mustache.Episode \\"Bub's Butler\\", My Three Sons, originally broadcast 4 April 1963. TV Guide, a subsidiary of CBS Interactive, Inc., New York, New York. Retrieved 4 August 2017. Later, he was briefly part of the regular cast of the family comedy Family Affair (1967). He appeared as well on Night Gallery in the series' episode \\"The Doll\\" (1971). One of Williams' last performances was in 1979, playing alongside fellow actor Lorne Greene in a two-part episode of Battlestar Galactica titled \\"War of the Gods\\". Williams gained notice too as the star of a frequently telecast commercial for 120 Music Masterpieces, a four-LP set of classical music excerpts from Columbia House. This became the longest-running nationally seen commercial in U.S. television history, for 13 years from 1971 to 1984. The commercial began with a brief selection of orchestral music being played. Williams then began the sales promotion with the following: In addition to his longstanding association with Hitchcock, Williams appeared in three Billy Wilder films over the course of his career: Sabrina (1954), Witness for the Prosecution (1957), and The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970). In Holmes, however, his scenes were among the 60 to 75 minutes cut by the studio prior to the film's release, when the studio decided not to release it in its intended roadshow format. Williams' scenes, along with the majority of the cut material, have not been recovered. Death Williams died at the age of 80 on 5 May 1983, in La Jolla, California. It was reported at the time of his death that he had been suffering from a heart condition.Los Angeles Times (7 May 1983), p. A28 He was cremated, and there was no funeral.

He was one of the founders of the University of North Carolina. During the American Revolutionary War, Williams was a colonel in the North Carolina militia. In 1777 and 1778, he was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons and served as Speaker of the House. Williams was a member of the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779. He served as a superior court judge both during the colonial era and after the new state of North Carolina was established in 1776. Sitting alongside other superior court judges as part of a Court of Conference (forerunner to the North Carolina Supreme Court), Williams heard the landmark case, Bayard v. Singleton, which announced the principle of judicial review on the state level before Marbury v. Madison did so on the federal level. Family and political career John Williams was born on July 7, 1704 in Hanover County, Virginia, the son of John Williams Sr and Mary Keeling. He married Mary Womack. They had 6 children, John Williams III, William Williams and Mary (Williams) Farra,Charles, William, Nathaniel who married Elizabeth Keeling, half-sister to the mother of George Washington, and Agatha who married Col.

Born at Tottenham, near London, England, he was trained as a foundry worker and mechanic. In September 1816, the London Missionary Society (LMS) commissioned him as a missionary in a service held at Surrey Chapel, London. South Pacific missionary John Williams In 1817, John Williams and his wife, Mary Chawner Williams, voyaged to the Society Islands, a group of islands that included Tahiti, accompanied by William Ellis and his wife. John and Mary established their first missionary post on the island of Raiatea. From there, they visited a number of the Polynesian island chains, sometimes with Mr and Mrs Ellis and other London Missionary Society representatives. Landing on Aitutaki in 1821, they used Tahitian converts to carry their message to the Cook islanders. One island in this group, Rarotonga (Captain John Dibbs of the colonial schooner Endeavour in August 1823 was the first European to sight the islands, with Rev. Williams on board), rises out of the sea as jungle-covered mountains of orange soil ringed by coral reef and turquoise lagoon; Williams became fascinated by it. John and Mary had ten children, but only three survived to adulthood. The Williamses became the first missionary family to visit Samoa. In 1827 Williams had heard of other heathen islands in the vicinity and in order to expand his ministry he built a ship from local materials, the Messenger of Peace, in fifteen weeks. He set sail by November 1827 for the Society Islands, not returning till February 1828, when he then removed his family to Raiatea. John Williams arrived in Samoa in 1830, among his crew, a Samoan couple, Fauea and his wife Puaseisei, who joined them on their voyage and proved pivotal in the mission in Samoa. They set foot on the island of Savaii at Puaseisei's village of Safune, before arriving at Sapapalii on the 24th of August, 1830, to meet with Malietoa Vaiinuupo who had sole power over Samoa following the death of his rival Tamafaiga. Williams' meeting with Malietoa proved a success, as Malietoa accepted Christianity immediately. The Williamses returned in 1834 to Britain, where John supervised the printing of his translation of the New Testament into the Rarotongan language. They brought back a native of Samoa named Leota, who came to live as a Christian in London. At the end of his days, Leota was buried in Abney Park Cemetery with a dignified headstone paid for by the London Missionary Society, recording his adventure from the South Seas island of his birth. Whilst back in London, John Williams published a \\"Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands\\", making a contribution to English understanding and popularity of the region, before returning to the Polynesian islands in 1837 on the ship Camden under the command of Captain Robert Clark Morgan. Death Massacre of John Williams and Mr. Harris, 1839 Congregationalists' pioneering nondenominational place of rest, Abney Park Cemetery (April 2006) Most of the Williamses' missionary work, and their delivery of a cultural message, was very successful and they became famed in Congregational circles. However, in November 1839, while visiting a part of the New Hebrides where John Williams was unknown, he and fellow missionary James Harris were killed and eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango during an attempt to bring them the Gospel. A memorial stone was erected on the island of Rarotonga in 1839 and is still there. Mrs. Williams died in June 1852. She is buried with their son Rev Samuel Tamatoa Williams, who was born in the New Hebrides, at the old Cedar Circle in London's Abney Park Cemetery; the name of her husband and the record of his death were placed on the most prominent side of the stone monument.Walks in Abney Park Cemetery' by James French Legacy LMS, 1869, p.36) The LMS successively operated seven missionary ships in the Pacific which were named after John Williams. They were funded by donations from children. The first, John Williams, was launched in 1844, and the last, John Williams VII, was decommissioned in 1968. In December 2009 descendants of John and Mary Williams travelled to Erromango to accept the apologies of descendants of the cannibals in a ceremony of reconciliation. To mark the occasion, Dillons Bay was renamed Williams Bay. Notes References * French, James. 1888. Walks in Abney Park Cemetery. * Hiney, Tom. 2000.

He is said to have worked as a \\"steel-driving man\\"‚Äîa man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock in constructing a railroad tunnel. The story of John Henry is told in a classic folk song, which exists in many versions, and has been the subject of numerous stories, plays, books, and novels.  Legend  Plaque celebrating the legend of John Henry (Talcott, West Virginia) According to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a steam-powered rock drilling machine, a race that he won only to die in victory with hammer in hand as his heart gave out from stress. Various locations, including Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia, Lewis Tunnel in Virginia, and Coosa Mountain Tunnel in Alabama, have been suggested as the site of the contest. The contest involved John Henry as the hammer man working in partnership with a shaker, who would hold a chisel-like drill against mountain rock, while the hammer man struck a powerful blow with a sledgehammer. Then the shaker would begin rocking and rolling: wiggling and rotating the drill to optimize its bite. The steam drill machine could drill but it could not shake the chippings away, so its bit could not drill further and frequently broke down. History The historical accuracy of many of the aspects of the John Henry legend are subject to debate. According to one researcher, the actual John Henry died of silicosis and not due to exhaustion of work. https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/books/18grim.htmlA sign by the C&O; Railway line near Talcott, West Virginia Several locations have been put forth for the tunnel on which John Henry died. =Big Bend Tunnel= Sociologist Guy B. Johnson investigated the legend of John Henry in the late 1920s. He concluded that John Henry might have worked on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway's (C&O; Railway) Big Bend Tunnel but that \\"one can make out a case either for or against\\" it. That tunnel was built near Talcott, West Virginia, from 1870 to 1872 (according to Johnson's dating), and named for the big bend in the Greenbrier River nearby. Some versions of the song refer to the location of John Henry's death as \\"The Big Bend Tunnel on the C. & O.\\" In 1927, Johnson visited the area and found one man who said he had seen it. When Johnson contacted Chief Engineer Johns of the C&O; Railroad he wrote that \\"no steam drills were ever used in this tunnel.\\" When asked about documentation from the period, Johns replied that \\"all such papers have been destroyed by fire.\\" Talcott holds a yearly festival named for Henry, and a statue and memorial plaque have been placed along West Virginia Route 3 south of Talcott as it crosses over the Big Bend tunnel.\\"Talcott prepares for John Henry Days\\", Sarah Plummer, The Register-Herald, 28 June 2010 (Coords ) =Lewis Tunnel= In the 2006 book Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend, historian Scott Reynolds Nelson detailed his discovering documentation of a 19-year-old African-American man alternately referred to as John Henry, John W. Henry, or John William Henry in previously unexplored prison records of the Virginia Penitentiary. At the time, penitentiary inmates were hired out as laborers to various contractors, and this John Henry was notated as having headed the first group of prisoners to be assigned tunnel work. Nelson also discovered the C&O;'s tunneling records, which the company believed had been destroyed by fire. Henry, like many African Americans, might have come to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the Civil War. Arrested and tried for burglary, John Henry was in the first group of convicts released by the warden to work as leased labor on the C&O; Railway. According to Nelson, objectionable conditions at the Virginia prison led the warden to believe that the prisoners, many of whom had been arrested on trivial charges, would be better clothed and fed if they were released as laborers to private contractors. (He subsequently changed his mind about this and became an opponent of the convict labor system.) In the C&O;'s tunneling records, Nelson found no evidence of a steam drill used in Big Bend Tunnel.Grimes, William. \\"Taking Swings at a Myth, With John Henry the Man\\", The New York Times, Books section, 18 October 2006. The records Nelson found indicate that the contest took place away at the Lewis Tunnel, between Talcott and Millboro, Virginia, where prisoners did indeed work beside steam drills night and day.Downes, Lawrence. \\"John Henry Days\\", The New York Times, Books section, 18 April 2008. Nelson also argues that the verses of the ballad about John Henry being buried near \\"the white house,\\" \\"in the sand,\\" somewhere that locomotives roar, mean that Henry's body was buried in a ditch behind the so- called white house of the Virginia State Penitentiary, which photos from that time indicate was painted white, and where numerous unmarked graves have been found. Prison records for John William Henry stopped in 1873, suggesting that he was kept on the record books until it was clear that he was not coming back and had died. Nelson stresses that John Henry would have been representative of the many hundreds of convict laborers who were killed in unknown circumstances tunneling through the mountains or who died shortly afterwards of silicosis from dust created by the drills and blasting. =Coosa Mountain Tunnel= There is another tradition that John Henry's famous race took place not in Virginia or West Virginia, but rather near Dunnavant, Alabama. Professor Johnson in the late 1920s received letters saying that John Henry worked on the A.G.S. Railway's Cruzee or Curzey Mountain Tunnel in 1882, and a third letter saying it was at Oak Mountain in 1887, but he discounted these reports after the A.G.S. told him that the railway had no such tunnel. Retired chemistry professor and folklorist John Garst, of the University of Georgia, has argued that the contest happened at the Coosa Mountain Tunnel or the Oak Mountain Tunnel of the Columbus and Western Railway (now part of Norfolk Southern Railway) near Dunnavant on September 20, 1887. Based on documentation that corresponds with the account of C. C. Spencer, who claimed in the 1920s to have witnessed the contest, Garst speculates that John Henry may have been a man named Henry who was born a slave to P.A.L. Dabney, the father of the chief engineer of that railroad, in 1850. Since 2007, the city of Leeds has honored John Henry's legend during an annual September festival, held on the third weekend in September, called the Leeds Downtown Folk Festival & John Henry Celebration.\\"Free Leeds Downtown Folk Festival is Saturday & Sunday\\", Christie Dedman ‚Äì The Birmingham News, 15 September 2011 \\"John Henry in Leeds\\" , Leeds Folk Festival Garst and Nelson have debated the merits of their divergent research conclusions.Garst, John (27 November 2006) \\"On the Trail of the Real John Henry\\". History News Network, George Mason University, includes rebuttal by Scott Nelson Other claims have been made over the years that place Henry and his contest in Kentucky or Jamaica. In other media The tale of John Henry has been used as a symbol in many cultural movements, including labor movements and the Civil Rights Movement. =Film= In October 2018, it was announced that Dwayne Johnson will portray the character in an upcoming film exclusive to Netflix titled John Henry and the Statesmen. The film is intended to be the first installment in a shared universe that centers around heroes of legend and folklore, from various ethnic groups and cultures. Jake Kasdan will direct the film, from a script written by Tom Wheeler. The film is a co-production between Seven Bucks Productions, Netflix Original Films, and Flynn Picture Company with Crews, Kasdan, Beau Flynn, Hiram Garcia, and Dany Garcia serving as co-producers. A teaser trailer was released with the announcement of the film stating that the release date was \\"coming soon\\". In 1995, John Henry was portrayed in the movie Tall Tale by Roger Aaron Brown. In 2020, Terry Crews plays a modern-day version of the legend in John Henry, in which he plays a former gang member who takes in two young teens who are on the run from his former gang leader, played by Ludacris. The film is being released by Saban Films. Animation In 1946, animator George Pal adapted the tale of John Henry into a short film titled John Henry and the Inky-Poo as part of his theatrical stop-motion Puppetoons series. The short is considered a milestone in American cinema as one of the first films to have a positive view of African-American folklore. In 1974, Nick Bosustow and David Adams co-produced an 11-minute animated short, The Legend of John Henry, for Paramount Pictures. The character later appeared in a Walt Disney Feature Animation short film, John Henry (1999). Directed by Mark Henn, plans for theatrical releases in 2000 and 2001 fell through after having a limited Academy Award qualifying run in Los Angeles, a shorter version was released as the only new entry in direct-to- video release, Disney's American Legends (2002). It was eventually released in its original format as an interstitial on the Disney Channel, and later as part of the home video compilation Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection in 2015. The 88th episode of season 5 of SpongeBob SquarePants, titled SpongeBob vs. The Patty Gadget, is a reference to the story of John Henry. It features SpongeBob competing against a machine called The Patty Gadget in an attempt to keep his job at The Krusty Krab. =Television= Danny Glover played the character in the series, Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales & Legends from 1985‚Äì1987. Duvall served as the series' creator, presenter, narrator, and executive producer. The show aired on Showtime Network as well as Disney Channel, and received a Primetime Emmy Award. The story of John Henry was prominently featured in a 2008 episode of the CBS crime drama, Cold Case. In season 2 of Smart guy episode \\"TJ versus the machine\\" , Floyd and TJ mentioned John Henry and his victory over the steam drill. John Henry is briefly mentioned in an episode of 30 Rock, during season 6 titled ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Kenneth Parcell‚Äù. In Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles season 2 episode 10 John Henry is introduced both as the name of ZeiraCorp's A.I. and as the tale of a man who is unable to halt progress. John Henry is also referenced in episode 4 of season 6 of the television show How I Met Your Mother, his legend briefly told through Marshall's song. =Music= The story of John Henry is traditionally told through two types of songs: ballads, commonly called \\"The Ballad of John Henry\\", and \\"hammer songs\\" (a type of work song), each with wide-ranging and varying lyrics. Some songs, and some early folk historian research, conflate the songs about John Henry with those of John Hardy, a West Virginian outlaw. Ballads about John Henry's life typically contain four major components: a premonition by John Henry as a child that steel-driving would lead to his death, the lead-up to and the results of the legendary race against the steam hammer, Henry's death and burial, and the reaction of his wife. The well-known narrative ballad of \\"John Henry\\" is usually sung in an upbeat tempo. Hammer songs associated with the \\"John Henry\\" ballad, however, are not. Sung more slowly and deliberately, often with a pulsating beat suggestive of swinging the hammer, these songs usually contain the lines \\"This old hammer killed John Henry / but it won't kill me.\\" Nelson explains that: > ... workers managed their labor by setting a \\"stint,\\" or pace, for it. Men > who violated the stint were shunned ... Here was a song that told you what > happened to men who worked too fast: they died ugly deaths; their entrails > fell on the ground. You sang the song slowly, you worked slowly, you guarded > your life, or you died. There is some controversy among scholars over which came first, the ballad or the hammer songs. Some scholars have suggested that the \\"John Henry\\" ballad grew out of the hammer songs, while others believe that the two were always entirely separate. Songs featuring the story of John Henry have been recorded by many musical artists and bands of different ethnic backgrounds. These include: *Charley Crockett *Mississippi Fred McDowell *Burl Ives *Josh White *Bill Monroe *Kabir Suman *Hemanga Biswas *Johnny Cash\\"The Legend of John Henry's Hammer\\" and \\"Nine Pound Hammer\\", both on Blood, Sweat and Tears; Cash also recorded a shorter version of the former as \\"John Henry\\" with a different account of the legend for Destination Victoria Station *Drive-By Truckers (on their The Dirty South album) *Joe Bonamassa *Furry Lewis *Big Bill Broonzy *Pink Anderson *Fiddlin' John Carson *Uncle Dave Macon *J.

They Might Be Giants named their fifth studio album after John Henry. The American cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer is named after the traditional description of the hammer John Henry wielded. In India Hemanga Biswas (1912-1987) considered to be as the Father of the Indian People's Theater Association Movement in Assam inspired by ‚ÄòJohn Henry‚Äô, the American ballad translated the song in Bengali as well as Assamese language and also composed its music for which he was well recognized among the masses =Literature= Henry is the subject of the 1931 Roark Bradford novel John Henry, illustrated by noted woodcut artist J. J. Lankes. The novel was adapted into a stage musical in 1940, starring Paul Robeson in the title role. According to Steven Carl Tracy, Bradford's works were influential in broadly popularizing the John Henry legend beyond railroad and mining communities and outside of African American oral histories. In a 1933 article published in The Journal of Negro Education, Bradford's John Henry was criticized for \\"making over a folk-hero into a clown.\\"Sterling A. Brown. \\"Negro Character as Seen by White Authors\\", The Journal of Negro Education, Vol. 2, No. 2 (Apr., 1933), pp. 179‚Äì203 A 1948 obituary for Bradford described John Henry as \\"a better piece of native folklore than Paul Bunyan.\\"\\"Bradford was one of Immortals\\", Robert C. Ruark, The Evening Independent, 22 November 1948 Ezra Jack Keats's John Henry: An American Legend, published in 1965, is a notable picture book chronicling the history of John Henry and portraying him as the \\"personification of the medieval Everyman who struggles against insurmountable odds and wins.\\" Colson Whitehead's 2001 novel John Henry Days uses the John Henry myth as story background. Whitehead fictionalized the John Henry Days festival in Talcott, West Virginia and the release of the John Henry postage stamp in 1996.\\"Freeloading Man\\", Jonathan Franzen, New York Times, 13 May 2001 The textbook titled American Music: A Panorama by Daniel Kingman displays the lyrics of the ballad titled \\"John Henry\\", explores its style and relates the history of the hero. That's in Chapter 2: The African‚ÄìAmerican Tradition. In the comic series DC: The New Frontier, an African American man named John Wilson becomes a vigilante in order to battle the Ku Klux Klan after his family is lynched. He names himself after John Henry and even uses John Henry's weapons/tools, two iron sledgehammers. For three months, he plagues the Klan in Tennessee. Unfortunately, he was wounded, discovered by a white girl, was caught by the Klan, and was burned alive. The DC Comics superhero Steel's civilian name, \\"John Henry Irons,\\" is inspired by John Henry.Action Comics #4 (February 2012) The story of John Henry is further referenced by Steel's weapon of choice, a sledgehammer. In DC's Super Friends #21 (January 2010), Superman encountered the actual John Henry after being placed in the folk tale by the Queen of Fables. Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky is a juvenile fantasy novel about seventh grader Tristan Strong who travels to another world and encounters black American gods.

He was sired by Ole Bob Bowers (by Prince Blessed) out of Once Double (by Double Jay). John Henry had 39 wins with $6,591,860 in earnings, was twice voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year, and was listed as #23 on Blood Horse magazine's Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. Background The horse was named after the folk hero John Henry. As a colt, John Henry had a habit of tearing steel water and feed buckets off stall walls and stomping them flat. This reminded his owners of the legendary John Henry, who was known as a \\"steel-drivin' man\\". He was gelded both for his temperament as well as his lack of good breeding, which meant that he would have been unlikely to be in much demand as a breeding stallion. John Henry was a Golden Chance Farm foal. His sire, Ole Bob Bowers, was sired by Prince Blessed and his dam, Once Double, was sired by Double Jay, a graded stakes race winner. John Henry was back at the knee (a flaw in conformation that generally makes a long racing career unlikely), undersized, and plainly bred. He was sold as a yearling for $1,100 at the Keeneland January Mixed sale to John Callaway who is credited with giving John Henry his name. Racing record John Henry had a series of trainers, and earned money in minor stakes, allowance races, and mid-level claiming races. In 1978, New York City businessman Sam Rubin and his wife Dorothy paid $25,000 sight-unseen for the three-year-old John Henry. Racing under the Rubins' Dotsam Stable banner, he was first conditioned by trainer Robert Donato. Under him, John Henry won 6 of 19 starts and $120,000, starting the year as a cheap claimer and getting his first graded stakes win in the Round Table Handicap at Arlington Park. In 1979, John Henry was given to a new trainer, Lefty Nickerson. Under him, John Henry won 4 of 11 races in 1979. When the grass season was over in New York, Rubin decided to send the horse to California under trainer Ron McAnally. Under McAnally, John Henry won six stakes races in a row. Racing through the age of nine, John Henry won the 1981 Santa Anita Handicap and repeated in 1982 after Perrault was disqualified. He is one of only three horses with back-to- back victories in the race's 72-year history. He also won the Arlington Million Stakes twice and won three renewals of both the Hollywood Invitational Handicap and the Oak Tree Invitational Stakes, two Grade I turf stakes in Southern California. He won one of America's most important races for older horses, the 1981 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park, at 1¬Ω miles on the dirt. This victory clinched his first Horse of the Year title. A bronze statue called Against All Odds, created by Edwin Bogucki, stands on a balcony overlooking the paddock at Arlington Park. It commemorates one of John Henry's most famous finishes; in 1981, at the inaugural Arlington Million, John Henry won over 5-year-old The Bart in a photo finish. On December 11, 1983, John Henry became the first racehorse to surpass $4 million in career earnings when he won the Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes with jockey Chris McCarron at Hollywood Park Racetrack. John Henry's last race was the 1984 Ballantine Scotch Classic at the Meadowlands. As he took the lead in the stretch, Meadowlands track announcer Dave Johnson exclaimed, \\"And down the stretch they come! The old man, John Henry, takes command!\\" He pulled away to his 39th career victory and his second Horse of the Year title. The final time of 2:13 equaled the track record for 1‚Öú mile. John Henry was a late entry into the Inaugural Breeders Cup in 1984 but a strained ligament in his left foreleg caused him to be withdrawn from the race and retired. John Henry's final race record stood at 83 starts, 39 wins, 15 seconds, and 9 thirds with $6,591,860 in earnings. He was twice voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year in 1981 and 1984; 1981 being the first unanimous election of the winner. That feat was not repeated until 2015 when Triple Crown winner American Pharoah was also elected unanimously. Retirement John Henry's brass nameplate After retirement, Rubin sent John Henry to the Hall of Champions at Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington. He joined three time Horse of the Year Forego, as well as Standardbred Rambling Willie, and Throroughbreds Rossi Gold and A Letter To Harry. The Hall Of Champions would in time become home to retired Thoroughbred champions Cigar, Da Hoss and Funny Cide. Regular rider Chris McCarron often described John Henry as very smart, commenting: \\"I'm just along for the ride.\\" John Henry, in the view of many followers of thoroughbred racing, was one of the best come-from-behind horses (or \\"closers\\") in recent history. In The Blood-Horse ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he was ranked #23. John Henry was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1990.John Henry Memorial Fund Death John Henry was euthanized at 7:05 pm EDT (2305 UTC) on October 8, 2007, at the age of 32. He developed serious kidney problems and stopped responding to veterinary treatment, so the decision was made to put him down. He was buried on the night of his death in front of the Hall of Champions at a spot in front of his paddock. A memorial service was held at the park on October 19.

He was born at his family's estate (Weston), located near Vienna in Dorchester County. Early life John Henry was born in November 1750. He was the son of Dorothy Rider and Col. John Henry and the grandson of Rev. John Henry, a Scotch Presbyterian minister who came to America in the early 1700s. His grandmother, Mary King, was the daughter of an Irish baronet. His mother was a descendant of one of the early settlers of Dorchester County. Henry attended West Nottingham Academy in Cecil County, Maryland and graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1769; he then studied law at the Middle Temple (one of the Inns of Court where English barristers are trained) in London. He returned to the United States in 1775 and practiced law in Dorchester County. Career He was a member of the Episcopal Church and the United States Democratic- Republican Party. Originally, he was a member of the Federalist Party. Henry served as a member of Maryland House of Delegates from 1777 to 1780 and a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1780 to 1790. During that time he was chosen as a delegate to the Continental Congress from Maryland from 1778 to 1780 and from 1785 to 1786; during his service, he was a member of the committee that prepared the ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory. He was elected as an inaugural Senator from Maryland, serving 1789 as a Federalist till his resignation on December 10, 1797, to assume the Governorship. In the 1796 election, Henry received two electoral votes for President of the United States. He served as Governor of Maryland from 1797 to 1798.

It originated as an intermittent serial in Punch magazine in 1888‚Äì89 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The Diary records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months. Before their collaboration on the Diary, the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate. Although its initial public reception was muted, the Diary came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The Diary has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including Ken Russell's \\"silent film\\" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts. Authorship and origin alt=Two men in suits. There is a family resemblance. The Diary of a Nobody was the work of George Grossmith and his brother Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of Hamlet, in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia. By 1877 the younger George Grossmith had established himself as a comic piano sketch entertainer in provincial institutes and literary societies. In that year he was seen by Arthur Sullivan and, separately, by W. S. Gilbert, in performances of their one-act comic opera Trial by Jury. Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, The Sorcerer.Bailey, pp. 116‚Äì117 Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of Gilbert and Sullivan's long-running comic operas until The Yeomen of the Guard, which closed in 1889. While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material. He became the most successful comic entertainer of his day, writing numerous operettas, around 100 piano sketches, some 600 songs and short piano pieces, and three books. For Punch magazine in 1884 he provided a series of short sketches based on his experiences as a court reporter at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. In 1889, Grossmith ended his connection with Gilbert and Sullivan to pursue his piano sketch career full-time and continued to perform until 1908. He died in 1912.Introduction, The Diary of a Nobody (1969), pp. 7‚Äì10 As an artist Weedon Grossmith exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Grosvenor Gallery. He also contributed illustrations to Punch and the prestigious Art Journal. He was nevertheless dissatisfied with his financial prospects as an artist, and by 1885 was pursuing an alternative career as an actor. He continued his career on the stage with considerable success until 1918, making his name playing roles he described as \\"cowards, cads and snobs\\", and as browbeaten small men under the thumb of authority. He wrote several plays, of which The Night of the Party (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two West End theatres. He died in 1919. The literary scholar Peter Morton, who published an annotated edition of the Diary in 2009, suggests that many of the events depicted in it were drawn from the brothers' own home experiences, and that Weedon, \\"something of a scapegrace compared with his perfectionist brother\\", was the model for Lupin. Synopsis alt=A drawing of a semi-detached, two- storied house. The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed that Charles Pooter and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at \\"The Laurels\\", Brickfield Terrace, Holloway. Mr Pooter is a City of London clerk with Perkupps, possibly an accountancy or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in Oldham. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from Sutton. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self- importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations. The rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the Lord Mayor of London to attend a ball at the Mansion House for \\"Representatives of Trade and Commerce\\". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor. In the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, \\"Lupin\\". He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupps. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in Broadstairs, but relationships are strained by Lupin's \\"fast\\" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the \\"Holloway Comedians\\". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement. alt=A drawing of a young woman in a dark dress and a bonnet Lupin's fianc√©e, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, \\"the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met\\". Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: \\"She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking\\". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off. In the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to \\"The Laurels\\". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy. In the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by ¬£100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by ¬£200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest ¬£600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship. April begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests‚Äîamong them Mr Padge‚Äîwith food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin. Lupin is sacked from Perkupps for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillion, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with ¬£25 commission and a job at ¬£200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh. Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as \\"Lillie Girl\\", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled ¬£10,000 on both Daisy and \\"Lillie Girl\\". Pooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupps a new client to replace Mr Crowbillion. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of \\"The Laurels\\" and presents the deeds to Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to \\"Lillie Girl\\": \\"We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings\\". Publication and reception history The first instalment in Punch (1888) The Diary made its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine Punch. The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: \\"As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection\\". The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in Punch.Hammerton, p. 291 The Punch serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupps. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith. In June 1892 J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd published the Diary in book form, although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910. After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982. The writer Robert McCrum, in a personal list of \\"The 100 greatest novels of all time\\" published in The Observer newspaper, listed the Diary at number 35. =Early indifference= The Punch serialisation attracted little critical comment; The Athenaeums literary critic thought the series \\"may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes\\". When the Diary was published as a book, Punch heralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as \\"very funny\\", adding: \\"not without a touch of pathos\\". However, apart from a warmly approving report in The Saturday Review, the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The Reviews critic thought the book \\"admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius\\", with a natural and irresistible appeal: \\"The Diary has amused us from cover to cover\\". This contrasted with the negative judgement of The Athenaeum, which opined that \\"the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing\\". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: \\"Besides, it is all so dull\\". The Speakers critic thought the book \\"a study in vulgarity\\", while The New York Times, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: \\"There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different\\". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.Publisher's note in 1910 edition of The Diary of a Nobody. =Growing reputation= alt=A drawing of a man of intellectual appearance By 1910 the Diary was beginning to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay \\"On People in Books\\", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the Diary as \\"one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time ... a glory for us all\\".Belloc, p. 43 Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were Lord Rosebery, the former prime minister, who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had \\"purchased and given away more copies than any living man ... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it\\".Prefatory note to 1910 edition of The Diary of a Nobody, p. 7. Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside Don Quixote as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book‚Äî\\"an illiterate charwoman, it is true\\"‚Äîcarried his name.Prefatory note to 1910 edition of The Diary of a Nobody, p. 9 Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition The Bookman critic wrote of Charles Pooter: \\"You laugh at him‚Äîat his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human\\". In its review of the book's fourth edition, published in 1919, The Bookman observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. \\"It has had many imitators ... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away\\". The reviewer recommended the book's \\"quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony\\". In Canada, Queen's Quarterly magazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that of the New York Times nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that \\"It is not till the second or third reading‚Äîand you are bound to reread it‚Äîthat the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent\\". The literary critic D. B. Wyndham Lewis summarised the Pooters as \\"warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads\\".Lewis, p. 203 =Acclaim= Evelyn Waugh praised The Diary of a Nobody as \\"the funniest book in the world\\" The novelist Evelyn Waugh had been familiar with the Diary since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents‚ÄîArthur Waugh used to read passages aloud to his family,Waugh 1983 (A Little Learning), p. 71 and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household.Hastings, pp. 12‚Äì13 Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay \\"One Way to Immortality\\" that it was \\"the funniest book in the world\\". He added: \\"Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years\\".Waugh 1983 (Essays and Reviews), pp. 84‚Äì86. The essay was originally published in the Daily Mail, 28 June 1930 Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world. In his 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the Diary \\"with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression\\".Waugh 1945, p. 149 Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage. At about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for the Diary another writer, J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar of English humour; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: \\"[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart\\".Priestley, p. 116 In a 1943 essay, George Orwell considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who \\"constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly\\".Orwell, p. 787 In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; Osbert Lancaster deemed it \\"a great work of art\\", and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the Diary \\"the best comic novel in the language\\", and lauded Pooter as \\"the presiding shade\\" of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: \\"Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?\\"Wilson 2003, p. 545 Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as \\"arbiters of the greatest good taste\\", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted \\"period\\" homes.Wilson 1989, p. 8 A Spectator article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as \\"The Laurels\\", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable ¬£1 million-plus homes in what it terms \\"banker land\\". Literary and cultural influence Charles (left) and Lupin Pooter at Broadstairs, from Chapter VI of The Diary of a Nobodyalt=A drawing of two men at the seaside. One is wearing an unusual helmet-like hat Peter Bailey, in his study \\"White Collars, Gray Lives\\" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the \\"disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers\\" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century.Bailey, p. 273 The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary \\"a sharp analysis of social insecurity\\". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: \\"putting the boot in on the lower middle classes\\", says Bailey, \\"has long been the intellectual's blood sport\\".Bailey, p. 274 However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as \\"Denry Machin\\", \\"Mr Polly\\" or \\"Mr Lewisham\\", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, \\"disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis.\\"Hammerton, p. 292 During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, \\"been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds\\". An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that \\"follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech\\" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, \\"burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class\\". The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978‚Äì81 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of \\"Simon Crisp\\", a bachelor would-be man- about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is \\"affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not\\". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter. Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter.Miller, pp. 212‚Äì13 In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it \\"captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men.\\" This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990‚Äì97, in \\"The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47\\", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.Gilbert and Preston, p. 199 The social historian James Hammerton defines \\"Pooterism\\" as \\"the dependent weakness and inflated social pretension of white-collar workers, constructed in the workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home\\".Hammerton, p. 295 Jon Wilde of The Guardian observes this characteristic in a number of British TV comedy creations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and Peep Shows Mark Corrigan are all examples of characters \\"whose blinkered view of themselves is forever in sharp contrast to how they are perceived by the world\\". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class pretension, pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the \\"elites\\". However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity.Hammerton, p. 296 Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths \\"would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life\\".Hammerton, pp. 320‚Äì21 Bailey remarks on how the poet John Betjeman presented the Pooters \\"not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat\\".Bailey, p. 280 Adaptations In September 1954 a stage version of the Diary, by Basil Dean and Richard Blake, was presented at London's Arts Theatre with a cast that included George Benson and Dulcie Gray as the Pooters and Leslie Phillips as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in The Spectator, classed this production as \\"fair-to-middling\\", with sympathetic performances from the principals: \\"[I]t is a precondition of this kind of play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter's employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking.\\" In 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his \\"Mrs Pooter\\" text at the Garrick Theatre, with Judi Dench and Michael Williams. This version was revived in 1993 at the Greenwich Theatre in a production by Matthew Francis. Clive Swift and Patricia Routledge played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in The Independent described as \\"essentially a two-hander ... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters\\". In March 2011 the Diary was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the Royal & Derngate Theatre, Northampton. Adapted by Hugh Osborne, with an all-male cast led by Robert Daws, this supposes that Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. Lyn Gardner in The Guardian found it \\"a show of some charm ‚Äì though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself\\". In 2014 a production of the Diary was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the White Bear Theatre and later transferred to the King's Head Theatre. This production was revived at the King's head in 2017; Time Out said of it: \\"It captures the original‚Äôs sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly\\". The first adaptation for screen was Ken Russell's short (40-minute) film for the BBC film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the silent films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, with the text narrated in a voice-over.Flanagan (ed.), pp. 7 and 19 The BBC screened two subsequent adaptations: in 1979 a version dramatised by Basil Boothroyd, and in 2007 a four-part dramatisation by Andrew Davies, directed by Susanna White and first shown on BBC Four as part of the channel's Edwardian season. The Guardians critic wrote of the latter that Hugh Bonneville was \\"immaculate as the ignored kerfuffler [Pooter].\\" BBC Radio 4 has broadcast several dramatisations of the Diary. These include Stephen Tompkinson and Annette Badland in a 2004 adaptation by Kelvin Segger, and Johnny Vegas and Katherine Parkinson in Andrew Lynch's 2012 adaptation. In May 1990, the BBC World Service broadcast a radio version of the 1986 Keith Waterhouse adaptation, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams; this production was later re-broadcast on 24 December 1991 on BBC Radio 4.

S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1951. It was the second published of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia (1950‚Äì1956), and Lewis had finished writing it in 1949, before the first book was out.Roger Lancelyn Green & Walter Hooper, C. S. Lewis: A Biography, 2002, p. 309. It is volume four in recent editions of the series, sequenced according to the internal chronology of the books. Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions. Prince Caspian features a \\"return to Narnia\\" by the four Pevensie children of the first novel, about a year later in England but 1300 years later in Narnia. It is the only book of The Chronicles with men dominating Narnia. The talking animals and mythical beings are oppressed, and some may be endangered. The English siblings, legendary , are magically recalled, once again children, by the refugee Prince Caspian. Macmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year. Prince Caspian has been adapted and filmed as two episodes of BBC television series in 1989 and as a feature film in 2008. Plot summary Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are magically whisked away from a British railway station to a beach near an old and ruined castle. They determine the ruin is Cair Paravel, where they once ruled as the Kings and Queens of Narnia. They discover the treasure vault where Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's dagger and bottle of magical cordial are stored. Susan's horn for summoning help is missing, as she left it in the woods the day they returned to England after their prior visit to Narnia. Although only a year has passed in England, 1300 years have passed in Narnia. The children rescue Trumpkin the dwarf from soldiers who are about to drown him. Trumpkin tells the children Narnia's history since their disappearance: Telmarines conquered Narnia, which is now ruled by King Miraz and his wife Queen Prunaprismia. Miraz usurped the throne by killing his brother, Caspian's father King Caspian IX. Miraz tolerated the rightful heir, Prince Caspian, son of the previous king, until his own son was born. Prince Caspian escaped from Miraz's Castle with the aid of his tutor Doctor Cornelius, who schooled him in the lore of Old Narnia, and gave him Queen Susan's horn. Caspian fled into the forest but was knocked unconscious when his horse bolted. He awoke in the den of a Talking Badger, Trufflehunter, and two dwarfs, Nikabrik and Trumpkin, who accepted Caspian as their king. The badger and dwarves took Caspian to meet many creatures of Old Narnia. During a midnight council on Dancing Lawn, Doctor Cornelius arrived to warn them of the approach of King Miraz and his army; he urged them to flee to Aslan's How in the great woods near Cair Paravel. The Telmarines followed the Narnians to the How, and after several skirmishes the Narnians appeared close to defeat. At a second war council, they decided to wind Queen Susan's horn in the hopes that it would bring help. Trumpkin and the Pevensies make their way to Caspian. The trek proves difficult, but Aslan appears to Lucy and instructs her to guide the others behind him. Aslan sends Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin ahead to Aslan's How to deal with treachery brewing there, and follows with Susan and Lucy. Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and drive out or kill the creatures threatening Caspian. Peter challenges Miraz to single combat: the army of the victor in this duel will be considered the victor in the war. Miraz accepts the challenge, goaded by Lords Glozelle and Sopespian. Miraz loses the combat, but Glozelle and Sopespian declare that the Narnians have cheated and stabbed the King in the back while he was down. They command the Telmarine army to attack, and in the commotion that follows, Glozelle stabs Miraz in the back. Aslan, accompanied by Lucy and Susan, summons the gods Bacchus and Silenus, and with their help brings the woods to life. The gods and awakened trees turn the tide of battle and send the Telmarines fleeing. Discovering themselves trapped at the Great River, where their bridge has been destroyed by Bacchus, the Telmarines surrender. Aslan gives the Telmarines a choice of staying in Narnia under Caspian or returning to Earth, their original home. After one volunteer disappears through the magic door created by Aslan, the Pevensies go through to reassure the other Telmarines, though Peter and Susan reveal to Edmund and Lucy that they are too old to return to Narnia. The Pevensies find themselves back at the railway station. Characters *Lucy Pevensie, the youngest Pevensie child, is the first to see Aslan again. *Edmund Pevensie is the third Pevensie child. Unlike his older siblings, he trusts Lucy's sighting of Aslan, pointing out that in their first adventure she turned out to be right and he ended up looking silly. *Peter Pevensie, the oldest of the Pevensie siblings, is High-King of Narnia. *Susan Pevensie is the second oldest of the Pevensie children. She uses a bow and arrow. *Prince Caspian, the rightful Telmarine King, who becomes King of Narnia. He reappears in the next two books in the series: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair, and makes a brief appearance in the end of The Last Battle. *Aslan, the Great Lion, who created Narnia. *Miraz, Caspian's uncle, usurped the throne of the Telmarines. So long as Miraz has no son, he tolerates Caspian as heir, but when a son is born he moves to eliminate Caspian. He fights the Old Narnians, who support Caspian, and accepts a challenge to single combat with Peter to settle the matter; but he is killed treacherously by Lord Glozelle after the duel. *Trumpkin, a Red Dwarf who helps Caspian defeat Miraz. When he is captured by Miraz's soldiers and taken to Cair Paravel to be drowned, he is freed by the Pevensie children and leads them to Caspian. At the beginning of the novel he is entirely sceptical about the existence of Aslan and the ancient Kings and Queens, but learns better in the course of the story. *Doctor Cornelius, half-dwarf and half-human, is tutor to Caspian and aids in the Narnians' defeat of the Telmarines. *Reepicheep, a Talking Mouse (descended from the non-talking mice who freed Aslan from his bonds in the previous book, and were thus given the gift of speech), is a fearless swordsman and a staunch supporter of Aslan and Caspian. *Nikabrik, a Black Dwarf in Caspian's army, resists fighting alongside Caspian. Together with a Hag and a Wer-Wolf, he plots to raise the White Witch against the Telmarines through black magic, but all three are killed by Caspian and his allies. *Trufflehunter, a Talking Badger, holds faith with Aslan and Old Narnia, and aids Prince Caspian in his struggle against Miraz. *Bacchus and Silenus, Narnian forest gods (borrowed from Ancient Greece). * Lord Sopespian and Lord Glozelle, lords of Telmar. After being insulted by Miraz they manipulate him into accepting Peter's challenge. They cry treachery when Miraz falls, and Glozelle secretly stabs him in the back. Sopespian is beheaded by Peter as the all-out battle begins, but Lewis does not mention the fate of Glozelle. Themes The two major themes of the story are courage and chivalry and, as Lewis himself said in a letter to an American girl, \\"the restoration of the true religion after a corruption\\".Walter Hooper, ed. The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III, p. 1245. The Telmarine conquest of Narnia, as depicted in the book, is in many ways similar to the historical Norman Conquest of England. Though there is no precise parallel in actual English history to the specific events of this book, the end result ‚Äì \\"Old Narnians\\" and Telmarines becoming a single people and living together in harmony ‚Äì is similar to the historical process of Saxons and Normans eventually fusing into a single English people. Adaptations The BBC adapted Prince Caspian in two episodes of the 1989 series of The Chronicles of Narnia. The second in the series of films from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, titled The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, was released in the US on 16 May 2008. The UK release date was 26 June 2008. The book was the inspiration for a song of the same name on the Phish album Billy Breathes. The script for a stage adaptation was written by Erina Caradus and first performed in 2007.Narnia Productions. narniaproductions.co.nz (Dunedin, New Zealand). Retrieved 10 December 2012.

Retrieved 2012-12-09. Most of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures that is ruled by the evil White Witch. In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia. Lewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser and trustee.Schakel 2002 p. 75 In 2003, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was ranked ninth on the BBC's The Big Read poll.\\"BBC ‚Äì The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003. Retrieved 26 July 2019 Time magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time. Plot Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are evacuated from London in 1940 to escape the Blitz, and sent to live with Professor Digory Kirke at a large house in the English countryside. While exploring the house, Lucy enters a wardrobe and discovers the magical world of Narnia. Here, she meets the faun Mr. Tumnus, who invites her to his cave for tea and admits that he intended to report Lucy to the White Witch, the false ruler of Narnia who has kept the land in perpetual winter, but he repents and guides her back home. Although Lucy's siblings initially disbelieve her story of Narnia, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe and winds up in a separate area of Narnia and meets the White Witch. The Witch plies Edmund with Turkish Delight and persuades him to bring his siblings to her with the promise of being made a prince. Edmund reunites with Lucy and they both return home. However, Edmund denies Narnia's existence to Peter and Susan after learning of the White Witch's identity from Lucy. Soon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together, but find that Mr. Tumnus has been arrested for treason. The children are befriended by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them of a prophecy that claims the White Witch's rule will end when \\"two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve\\" sit on the four thrones of Cair Paravel, and that Narnia's true ruler ‚Äì a great lion named Aslan ‚Äì is returning at the Stone Table after several years of absence. Edmund slips away to the White Witch's castle, where he finds a courtyard filled with the Witch's enemies turned into stone statues. Edmund reports Aslan's return to the White Witch, who begins her movement toward the Stone Table with Edmund in tow, and orders the execution of Edmund's siblings and the Beavers. Meanwhile, the Beavers realise where Edmund has gone, and lead the children to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. During the trek, the group notices that the snow is melting, and take it as a sign that the White Witch's magic is fading. This is confirmed by a visit from Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the Witch's magic, and he leaves the group with gifts and weapons. The children and the Beavers reach the Stone Table and meet Aslan and his army. The White Witch's wolf captain Maugrim approaches the camp and attacks Susan, but is killed by Peter. The White Witch arrives and parleys with Aslan, invoking the \\"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\" which gives her the right to kill Edmund for his treason. Aslan then speaks to the Witch alone, and on his return he announces that the Witch has renounced her claim on Edmund's life. Aslan and his followers then move the encampment on into the nearby forest. That evening, Susan and Lucy secretly follow Aslan to the Stone Table. They watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death ‚Äì as they had agreed in their pact to spare Edmund. The next morning, Aslan is resurrected by the \\"Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time\\", which has the power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor. Aslan takes the girls to the Witch's castle and revives the Narnians that the Witch had turned to stone. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch's army. The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel. After a long and happy reign, the Pevensies, now adults, go on a hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The four arrive at the lamp- post marking Narnia's entrance and, having forgotten about it, unintentionally pass through the wardrobe and return to England; they are children again, with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to Kirke, who believes them and reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it. Main characters *Lucy is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary protagonist of the story. She is the first to discover the land of Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe while exploring the Professor's house. When Lucy tells her three siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant. *Edmund is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned King Edmund the Just. *Susan is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of Edmund's. Tending to Aslan's carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavor to bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan the Gentle. *Peter is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude. Peter also disbelieves Lucy's stories about Narnia until he sees it for himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of Maugrim and for his command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent. *Aslan, a lion, is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and her minions. As the \\"son of the Emperor beyond the sea\\" (an allusion to God the Father), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical portrait, of Christ.Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in *The White Witch is the land's self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the story. Her reign in Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with her wand. She fears the fulfillment of a prophecy that \\"two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve\\" (meaning two male humans and two female humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as \\"the White Witch\\", or just \\"the Witch\\". Her actual name, Jadis, appears once in the notice left on Tumnus's door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a prequel to include her back story and account for her presence in the Narnian world. *The Professor is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of the series). *Tumnus, a faun, is the first individual Lucy (who calls him \\"Mr. Tumnus\\") meets in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch's standing order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the Witch's forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund. The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later restored to life by Aslan. *Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, two beavers, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan and Lucy and lead them to Aslan. Writing Lewis described the origin of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay titled \\"It All Began with a Picture\\":Lewis (1960). \\"It All Began with a Picture\\". Radio Times. 15 July 1960. In Hooper (1982), p. 53. :The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.' Shortly before the Second World War many children were evacuated from London to the English countryside to escape bomber attacks on London by Nazi Germany. On 2 September 1939 three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine,Ford, p. 106.\\"Of Other Worlds\\", by C. S. Lewis\\". Huntington. Retrieved 2014-12-24. came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late SeptemberEdwards, Owen Dudley (2007). British Children's Fiction in the Second World War. p. 129. . he began a children's story on an odd sheet that has survived as part of another manuscript: :This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.Green, Roger Lancelyn, and Walter Hooper (2002). C. S. Lewis: A Biography. Fully Revised and Expanded Edition. p. 303. . How much more of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain. Roger Lancelyn Green thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947 Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: \\"I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.\\"Lewis (2004 [1947]). Collected Letters: Volume 2 (1931‚Äì1949). p. 802. . Letter to E. L. Baxter dated 10 September 1947. The plot element of entering a new world through the back of a wardrobe had certainly entered Lewis's mind by 1946, when he used it to describe his first encounter with really good poetry: :I did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or better quality a pleasure I had already known. It was more as if a cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats proved one day, when you opened the door, to lead to the garden of the Hesperides ...Lewis (1946), \\"Different Tastes in Literature\\". In Hooper (1982), p. 121. In August 1948, during a visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis talked vaguely about completing a children's book he had begun \\"in the tradition of E. Nesbit\\".Walsh, Chad (1974). C. S. Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics. Norwood Editions. p. 10. . After this conversation not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay \\"It All Began With a Picture\\" Lewis continues: \\"At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\\"Lewis (1960). In Hooper (1982), pp. xix, 53. The major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written fourteen years earlier in his alliterative poem The Planets: :... Of wrath ended :And woes mended, of winter passed :And guilt forgiven, and good fortune :JOVE is master; and of jocund revel, :Laughter of ladies. The lion-hearted :... are Jove's children.Lewis (1935), \\"The Alliterative Metre\\". In Hooper, ed. (1969), Selected Literary Essays, Cambridge University Press, , p. 25. This resonance is a central component of the case, promoted chiefly by Oxford University scholar Michael Ward, for the seven Chronicles having been modelled upon the seven classical astrological planets, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe upon Jupiter.Michael Ward (2008), Planet Narnia: the seven heavens in the imagination of C.S. Lewis, Oxford University Press, . On 10 March 1949 Roger Lancelyn Green dined with Lewis at Magdalen College. After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.Hooper, Walter. \\"Lucy Barfield (1935‚Äì2003)\\". SEVEN: An Anglo-American Literary Review. Volume 20, 2003, p. 5. . \\"The dedication ... was probably taken from Lewis's letter to Lucy of May 1949\\". When on 16 October 1950 Geoffrey Bles in London published the first edition, three new \\"chronicles\\", Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, had also been completed. Illustrations Lewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, allowed him to choose the illustrator for the novel and the Narnia series. Lewis chose Pauline Baynes, possibly based on J. R. R. Tolkien's recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis's appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after The Last Battle won the Carnegie Medal for best children's book of 1956: \\"is it not rather 'our' medal? I'm sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text\\".Schakel 2002, pp. 30‚Äì31. The British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.Schakel 2002, p. 132. Reception Lewis very much enjoyed writing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and embarked on the sequel Prince Caspian soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late in 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.Veith, pp. 11‚Äì12. While Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children's writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated‚Äîattempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.Veith, p. 12. Lewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis's reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.Veith, p. 13. In the United States a 2004 study found that The Lion was a common read-aloud book for seventh-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. In 2005 it was included on TIME's unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". In 2012 it was ranked number five among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. A 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was the second most common book that UK adults had read as children, after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. (Adults, perhaps limited to parents, ranked Alice and The Lion fifth and sixth as books the next generation should read, or their children should read during their lifetimes.) TIME magazine included the novel in its \\"All-TIME 100 Novels\\" (best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005). In 2003, the novel was listed at number 9 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\\"BBC - The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003. Retrieved 2012-10-19.

Updated 3 August 2010. Confirmed 2012-12-10. Reading order The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was originally published as the first book in the Narnia Chronicles. Most reprintings of the novels until the 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 HarperCollins published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in the novels. This meant The Magician's Nephew was numbered as the first in the series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of the novels outside the United States, also acquired the rights to publish the novels in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.Schakel, pp. 13‚Äì16. Laurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels‚Äîaccording to the sequence of events, with The Magician's Nephew being placed first‚Äîand that of his mother, who thought the order of publication (with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe being placed first) was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author may not be the best guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.Schakel, pp. 17‚Äì18. However publication order reflects Lewis's strategy for drawing readers into the world of Narnia. In the book he wrote first, Lucy Pevensie's discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious lamp post creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in The Magician's Nephew and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe and the lamp post. Indeed, the narrative of The Magician's Nephew appears to assume that the reader has already read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and is now being shown its beginnings.Schakel, pp. 19‚Äì21. Paul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology,Ford, pp. xxiii‚Äìxxiv. and continues, \\"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions\\".Ford, p. 24. Allusions Lewis wrote that \\"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption.

Aslan sacrifices himself for Edmund, a traitor who may deserve death, in the same way that Christians believe Jesus sacrificed himself for sinners. Aslan is killed on the Stone Table, symbolising Mosaic Law, which breaks when he is resurrected, symbolising the replacement of the strict justice of Old Testament law with redeeming grace and forgiveness granted on the basis of substitutionary atonement, according to Christian theology. The character of the Professor is based on W.T. Kirkpatrick, who tutored a 16-year-old Lewis. \\"Kirk\\", as he was sometimes called, taught the young Lewis much about thinking and communicating clearly, skills that would be invaluable to him later. Narnia is caught in endless winter that has lasted a century when the children first enter. Norse tradition mythologises a \\"great winter\\", known as the Fimbulwinter, said to precede Ragnar√∂k. The trapping of Edmund by the White Witch is reminiscent of the seduction and imprisonment of Kai by the Snow Queen in Hans Christian Andersen's novella of that name. There are several parallels between the White Witch and the immortal white queen, Ayesha, of H. Rider Haggard's She, a novel greatly admired by Lewis. Edith Nesbit's short story The Aunt and Amabel includes the motif of a girl entering a wardrobe to gain access to a magical place. The freeing of Aslan's body from the Stone Table is reminiscent of a scene from Edgar Allan Poe's story \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\", in which a prisoner is freed when rats gnaw through his bonds. Project Gutenberg. In a later book, Prince Caspian, we learn that as reward for their actions, mice gained the same intelligence and speech as other Narnian animals.Prince Caspian, Chapter 15.  Religious themes  One of the most significant themes seen in C. S. Lewis's The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the theme of Christianity. Various aspects of characters and events in the novel reflect biblical ideas from Christianity. The lion Aslan is one of the largest examples, as his death is very similar to that of Jesus Christ. While many readers made this connection, Lewis denied that the themes of Christianity were intentional, saying that his writing began by picturing images of characters, and the rest just came about through the writing process. While Lewis denied intentionally making the story a strictly Christian theological novel, he did admit that it could help young children accept Christianity into their lives when they were older. After the children enter the world of Narnia through the wardrobe, Edmund finds himself in trouble under service of the White Witch, as she tempts him with Turkish Delights. When Edmund is threatened with death, Aslan offers to sacrifice himself instead. Aslan is shaved of his fur, and stabbed on an altar of stone. This is similar to how Jesus was publicly beaten, humiliated and crucified. After his sacrifice, Aslan is later reborn, and continues to help the children save Narnia. While this sequence of events is comparable to the death of Jesus, it is not identical to it. There are a few differences, such as the fact that Aslan did not allow himself to be killed to save the entirety of Narnia, but only to save Edmund. Aslan is also only dead for one night, while Jesus returned on the third day. Despite these differences, the image of Aslan and the event of his death and rebirth reflect those of the biblical account of Jesus' death and resurrection, adding to the theme of Christianity throughout the novel. Differences between editions Due to labor union rules, the text of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was reset for the publication of the first American edition of by Macmillan US in 1950. Lewis took that opportunity to make the following changes to the original British edition published by Geoffrey Bles earlier that same year: *In chapter one of the American edition, the animals that Edmund and Susan express interest in are snakes and foxes rather than the foxes and rabbits of the British edition. p. 122. *In chapter six of the American edition, the name of the White Witch's chief of police is changed to \\"Fenris Ulf\\" from \\"Maugrim\\" in the British. pp. 138, 173.Ford, p. 213. *In chapter thirteen of the American edition, \\"the trunk of the World Ash Tree\\" takes the place of \\"the fire-stones of the Secret Hill\\".Ford, p. 459.

It was named after the legends on the coin indicating the king's intention of uniting his two kingdoms of England and Scotland.Herbert Grueber: Handbook of the Coins of Great Britain and Ireland in the British Museum, Londra 1899. p. XXXIX (reprint 1970 ) The unite was valued at twenty shillings until 1612 when the increase in the value of gold throughout Europe caused it to be raised to twenty-two shillings. The coin was produced during James I's second coinage (1604‚Äì1619), and it was replaced in the third coinage by the Laurel worth twenty shillings. All the coins were produced at the Tower Mint in London. Several busts of the king were used for this denomination, who is shown looking to the right of the coin and is holding the orb and sceptre; the style of the king's beard varies during the issue. The legend on the obverse reads IACOBUS D G MA BRI FRA ET HI REX (Iacobus Dei Gratia Magnae Britanniae Franciae et Hiberniae Rex) - James by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland. The reverse shows a crowned shield which shows the arms of the four countries separating the letters IR - Iacobus Rex, King James, and the legend FACIAM EOS IN GENTEM UNAM (\\"I will make them one nation\\", from Ezekiel 37:22). Numerous issues of gold unites valued at twenty shillings were produced at the Tower Mint throughout the reign of King Charles I (1625-1649), both when the mint was under the king's control and under Parliament's control. They depict the crowned bust of the king on the obverse, looking left, with the value \\"XX\\" appearing behind the king's head, and the legend CAROLUS D G MAG BR FR ET HI REX - Charles by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland. The reverse shows a crown over a shield bearing the royal arms and the legend FLORENT CONCORDIA REGNA - Through concord kingdoms flourish.

In mathematics, the concept of a projective space originated from the visual effect of perspective, where parallel lines seem to meet at infinity. A projective space may thus be viewed as the extension of a Euclidean space, or, more generally, an affine space with points at infinity, in such a way that there is one point at infinity of each direction of parallel lines. This definition of a projective space has the disadvantage of not being isotropic, having two different sorts of points, which must be considered separately in proofs. Therefore other definitions are generally preferred. There are two classes of definitions. In synthetic geometry, point and lines are primitive entities that are related by the incidence relation \\"a point is on a line\\" or \\"a line passes through a point\\", which is subject to the axioms of projective geometry. For some such set of axioms, the projective spaces that are defined have been shown to be equivalent to those resulting from the following definition, which is more often encountered in modern textbooks. Using linear algebra, a projective space of dimension is defined as the set of the vector lines (that is, vector subspaces of dimension one) in a vector space of dimension . Equivalently, it is the quotient set of by the equivalence relation \\"being on the same vector line\\". As a vector line intersects the unit sphere of in two antipodal points, projective spaces can be equivalently defined as spheres in which antipodal points are identified. A projective space of dimension 1 is a projective line, and a projective space of dimension 2 is a projective plane. Projective spaces are widely used in geometry, as allowing simpler statements and simpler proofs. For example, in affine geometry, two distinct lines in a plane intersect in at most one point, while, in projective geometry, they intersect in exactly one point. Also, there is only one class of conic sections, which can be distinguished only by their intersections with the line at infinity: two intersection points for hyperbolas; one for the parabola, which is tangent to the line at infinity; and no real intersection point of ellipses. In topology, and more specifically in manifold theory, projective spaces play a fundamental role, being typical examples of non-orientable manifolds. Motivation Projective plane and central projection As outlined above, projective spaces were introduced for formalizing statements like \\"two coplanar lines intersect in exactly one point, and this point is at infinity if the lines are parallel.\\" Such statements are suggested by the study of perspective, which may be considered as a central projection of the three dimensional space onto a plane (see Pinhole camera model). More precisely, the entrance pupil of a camera or of the eye of an observer is the center of projection, and the image is formed on the projection plane. Mathematically, the center of projection is a point of the space (the intersection of the axes in the figure); the projection plane (, in blue on the figure) is a plane not passing through , which is often chosen to be the plane of equation , when Cartesian coordinates are considered. Then, the central projection maps a point to the intersection of the line with the projection plane. Such an intersection exists if and only if the point does not belong to the plane (, in green on the figure) that passes through and is parallel to . It follows that the lines passing through split in two disjoint subsets: the lines that are not contained in , which are in one to one correspondence with the points of , and those contained in , which are in one to one correspondence with the directions of parallel lines in . This suggests to define the points (called here projective points for clarity) of the projective plane as the lines passing through . A projective line in this plane consists of all projective points (which are lines) contained in a plane passing through . As the intersection of two planes passing through is a line passing through , the intersection of two distinct projective lines consists of a single projective point. The plane defines a projective line which is called the line at infinity of . By identifying each point of with the corresponding projective point, one can thus say that the projective plane is the disjoint union of and the (projective) line at infinity. As an affine space with a distinguished point may be identified with its associated vector space (see ), the preceding construction is generally done by starting from a vector space and is called projectivization. Also, the construction can be done by starting with a vector space of any positive dimension. So, a projective space of dimension can be defined as the set of vector lines (vector subspaces of dimension one) in a vector space of dimension . A projective space can also be defined as the elements of any set that is in natural correspondence with this set of vector lines. This set can be the set of equivalence classes under the equivalence relation between vectors defined by \\"one vector is the product of the other by a nonzero scalar\\". In other words, this amounts to defining a projective space as the set of vector lines in which the zero vector has been removed. A third equivalent definition is to define a projective space of dimension as the set of pairs of antipodal points in a sphere of dimension (in a space of dimension ). Definition Given a vector space over a field , the projective space is the set of equivalence classes of under the equivalence relation defined by if there is a nonzero element of such that . If is a topological vector space, the quotient space is a topological space, endowed with the quotient topology. This is the case when is the field \\\\mathbb R of the real numbers or the field \\\\mathbb C of the complex numbers. If is finite dimensional, the dimension of is the dimension of minus one. In the common case where , the projective space is denoted (as well as or , although this notation may be confused with exponentiation). The space is often called the projective space of dimension over , or the projective -space, since all projective spaces of dimension are isomorphic to it (because every vector space of dimension is isomorphic to . The elements of a projective space are commonly called points. If a basis of has been chosen, and, in particular if , the projective coordinates of a point P are the coordinates on the basis of any element of the corresponding equivalence class. These coordinates are commonly denoted , the colons and the brackets being used for distinguishing from usual coordinates, and emphasizing that this is an equivalence class, which is defined up to the multiplication by a non zero constant. That is, if are projective coordinates of a point, then are also projective coordinates of the same point, for any nonzero in . Also, the above definition implies that are projective coordinates of a point if and only if at least one of the coordinates is nonzero. If is the field of real or complex numbers, a projective space is called a real projective space or a complex projective space, respectively. If is one or two, a projective space of dimension is called a projective line or a projective plane, respectively. The complex projective line is also called the Riemann sphere. All these definitions extend naturally to the case where is a division ring; see, for example, Quaternionic projective space. The notation is sometimes used for .Mauro Biliotti, Vikram Jha, Norman L. Johnson (2001) Foundations of Translation Planes, p. 506, Marcel Dekker If is a finite field with elements, is often denoted (see PG(3,2)).The absence of space after the comma is common for this notation. Related concepts =Subspace= Let be a projective space, where is a vector space over a field , and :p:V\\\\to \\\\mathbf P(V) be the canonical map that maps a nonzero vector to its equivalence class, which is the vector line containing with the zero vector removed. Every linear subspace of is a union of lines. It follows that is a projective space, which can be identified with . A projective subspace is thus a projective space that is obtained by restricting to a linear subspace the equivalence relation that defines . If and are two different points of , the vectors and are linearly independent. It follows that: :There is exactly one projective line that passes through two different points of and :A subset of is a projective subspace if and only if, given any two different points, it contains the whole projective line passing through these points. In synthetic geometry, where projective lines are primitive objects, the first property is an axiom, and the second one is the definition of a projective subspace. =Span= Every intersection of projective subspaces is a projective subspace. It follows that for every subset of a projective space, there is a smallest projective subspace containing , the intersection of all projective subspaces containing . This projective subspace is called the projective span of , and is a spanning set for it. A set of points is projectively independent if its span is not the span of any proper subset of . If is a spanning set of a projective space , then there is a subset of that spans and is projectively independent (this results from the similar theorem for vector spaces). If the dimension of is , such an independent spanning set has elements. Contrarily to the cases of vector spaces and affine spaces, an independent spanning set does not suffice for defining coordinates. One needs one more point, see next section. =Frame= A projective frame is a set of points in a projective space that allows defining coordinates. More precisely, in a -dimensional projective space, a projective frame is a set of points such that any of them are independent‚Äîthat is are not contained in a hyperplane. If is a -dimensional vector space, and is the canonical projection from to , then (p(e_0),\\\\dots, p(e_{n+1})) is a projective frame if and only if (e_0, \\\\dots, e_n) is a basis of , and e_{n+1} = e_0 +\\\\dots+e_n. Moreover, if (f_0, \\\\dots, f_{n+1}) is another set of vectors that defines the same frame, there is a nonzero scalar \\\\lambda such that f_i=\\\\lambda e_i for . The projective coordinates or homogeneous coordinates of a point on a frame (p(e_0),\\\\dots, p(e_{n+1})) are the coordinates of on the basis (e_0, \\\\dots, e_n). The canonical frame of the projective space consists of images by of the elements of the canonical basis of (the tuples with only one zero entry, equal to 1), and the image by of their sum. =Projective transformation= Topology A projective space is a topological space, as endowed with the quotient topology of the topology of a finite dimensional real vector space. Let be the unit sphere in a normed vector space , and consider the function :\\\\pi: S \\\\to \\\\mathbf P(V) that maps a point of to the vector line passing through it. This function is continuous and surjective. The inverse image of every point of consist of two antipodal points. As spheres are compact spaces, it follows that: :A (finite dimensional) projective space is compact. For every point of , the restriction of to a neighborhood of is a homeomorphism onto its image, provided that the neighborhood is small enough for not containing any pair of antipodal points. This shows that a projective space is a manifold. A simple atlas can be provided, as follows. As soon as a basis has been chosen for , any vector can be identified with its coordinates on the basis, and any point of may be identified with its homogeneous coordinates. For , the set :U_i = \\\\\\\\{[x_0:\\\\cdots: x_n], x_i eq 0\\\\\\\\} is an open subset of , and :\\\\mathbf P(V) = \\\\bigcup_{i=0}^nU_i since every point of has at least one nonzero coordinate. To each is associated a chart, which is the homeomorphisms :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbb \\\\varphi_i: R^n &\\\\to U_i\\\\\\\\\\\\ (y_0,\\\\dots,\\\\widehat{y_i},\\\\dots y_n)&\\\\mapsto [y_0:\\\\cdots:y_{i-1}:1:y_{i+1}:\\\\cdots:y_n], \\\\end{align} such that :\\\\varphi_i^{-1}\\\\left([x_0:\\\\cdots x_n]\\\\right) =\\\\left (\\\\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \\\\dots, \\\\widehat{\\\\frac{x_i}{x_i}}, \\\\dots, \\\\frac{x_n}{x_i} \\\\right ), where hats means that the corresponding term is missing. Manifold structure of the real projective line These charts form an atlas, and, as the transition maps are analytic functions, it results that projective spaces are analytic manifolds. For example, in the case of , that is of a projective line, there are only two , which can each be identified to a copy of the real line. In both lines, the intersection of the two charts is the set of nonzero real numbers, and the transition map is :x\\\\mapsto \\\\frac 1x in both directions. The image represents the projective line as a circle where antipodal points are identified, and shows the two homeomorphisms of a real line to the projective line; as antipodal points are identified, the image of each line is represented as an open half circle, which can be identified with the projective line with a single point removed. =CW complex structure= Real projective spaces have a simple CW complex structure, as can be obtained from by attaching an -cell with the quotient projection as the attaching map. Algebraic geometry Originally, algebraic geometry was the study of common zeros of sets of multivariate polynomials. These common zeros, called algebraic varieties belong to an affine space. It appeared soon, that in the case of real coefficients, one must consider all the complex zeros for having accurate results. For example, the fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that a univariate square-free polynomial of degree has exactly complex roots. In the multivariate case, the consideration of complex zeros is also needed, but not sufficient: one must also consider zeros at infinity. For example, B√©zout's theorem asserts that the intersection of two plane algebraic curves of respective degrees and consists of exactly points if one consider complex points in the projective plane, and if one counts the points with their multiplicity. Another example is the genus‚Äìdegree formula that allows computing the genus of a plane algebraic curve form its singularities in the complex projective plane. So a projective variety is the set of points in a projective space, whose homogeneous coordinates are common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials. Any affine variety can be completed, in a unique way, into a projective variety by adding its points at infinity, which consists of homogenizing the defining polynomials, and removing the components that are contained in the hyperplane at infinity, by saturating with respect to the homogenizing variable. An important property of projective spaces and projective varieties is that the image of a projective variety under a morphism of algebraic varieties is closed for Zariski topology (that is, it is an algebraic set). This is a generalization to every ground field of the compactness of the real and complex projective space. A projective space is itself a projective variety, being the set of zeros of the zero polynomial. =Scheme theory= Scheme theory, introduced by Alexander Grothendieck during the second half of 20th century, allows defining a generalization of algebraic varieties, called schemes, by gluing together smaller pieces called affine schemes, similarly as manifolds can be built by gluing together open sets of \\\\mathbb R^n. The Proj construction is the construction of the scheme of a projective space, and, more generally of any projective variety, by gluing together affine schemes. In the case of projective spaces, one can take for these affine schemes the affine schemes associated to the charts (affine spaces) of the above description of a projective space as a manifold.  Synthetic geometry  In synthetic geometry, a projective space S can be defined axiomatically as a set P (the set of points), together with a set L of subsets of P (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms: * Each two distinct points p and q are in exactly one line. * Veblen's axiom:also referred to as the Veblen‚ÄìYoung axiom and mistakenly as the axiom of Pasch . Pasch was concerned with real projective space and was attempting to introduce order, which is not a concern of the Veblen‚ÄìYoung axiom. If a, b, c, d are distinct points and the lines through ab and cd meet, then so do the lines through ac and bd. * Any line has at least 3 points on it. The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces. More abstractly, it can be defined as an incidence structure consisting of a set P of points, a set L of lines, and an incidence relation I that states which points lie on which lines. The structures defined by these axioms are more general than those obtained from the vector space construction given above. If the (projective) dimension is at least three then, by the Veblen‚ÄìYoung theorem, there is no difference. However, for dimension two, there are examples that satisfy these axioms that can not be constructed from vector spaces (or even modules over division rings). These examples do not satisfy the Theorem of Desargues and are known as Non-Desarguesian planes. In dimension one, any set with at least three elements satisfies the axioms, so it is usual to assume additional structure for projective lines defined axiomatically. It is possible to avoid the troublesome cases in low dimensions by adding or modifying axioms that define a projective space. gives such an extension due to Bachmann. To ensure that the dimension is at least two, replace the three point per line axiom above by; * There exist four points, no three of which are collinear. To avoid the non-Desarguesian planes, include Pappus's theorem as an axiom;As Pappus's theorem implies Desargues's theorem this eliminates the non-Desarguesian planes and also implies that the space is defined over a field (and not a division ring). * If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear. And, to ensure that the vector space is defined over a field that does not have even characteristic include Fano's axiom;This restriction allows the real and complex fields to be used (zero characteristic) but removes the Fano plane and other planes that exhibit atypical behavior. * The three diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are never collinear. A subspace of the projective space is a subset X, such that any line containing two points of X is a subset of X (that is, completely contained in X). The full space and the empty space are always subspaces. The geometric dimension of the space is said to be n if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form: : \\\\varnothing = X_{-1}\\\\subset X_{0}\\\\subset \\\\cdots X_{n}=P. A subspace X_i in such a chain is said to have (geometric) dimension i. Subspaces of dimension 0 are called points, those of dimension 1 are called lines and so on. If the full space has dimension n then any subspace of dimension n-1 is called a hyperplane. =Classification= *Dimension 0 (no lines): The space is a single point. *Dimension 1 (exactly one line): All points lie on the unique line. *Dimension 2: There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet. A projective space for is equivalent to a projective plane. These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a . The Desarguesian planes (those that are isomorphic with a satisfy Desargues's theorem and are projective planes over division rings, but there are many non- Desarguesian planes. *Dimension at least 3: Two non-intersecting lines exist. proved the Veblen‚ÄìYoung theorem that every projective space of dimension is isomorphic with a , the n-dimensional projective space over some division ring K. =Finite projective spaces and planes= The Fano plane A finite projective space is a projective space where P is a finite set of points. In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the order of the space is defined as one less than this common number. For finite projective spaces of dimension at least three, Wedderburn's theorem implies that the division ring over which the projective space is defined must be a finite field, GF(q), whose order (that is, number of elements) is q (a prime power). A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide. Notationally, is usually written as . All finite fields of the same order are isomorphic, so, up to isomorphism, there is only one finite projective space for each dimension greater than or equal to three, over a given finite field. However, in dimension two there are non-Desarguesian planes. Up to isomorphism there are : 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, ‚Ä¶ finite projective planes of orders 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, respectively. The numbers beyond this are very difficult to calculate and are not determined except for some zero values due to the Bruck‚ÄìRyser theorem. The smallest projective plane is the Fano plane, with 7 points and 7 lines. The smallest 3-dimensional projective spaces is PG(3,2), with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes.  Morphisms  Injective linear maps between two vector spaces V and W over the same field k induce mappings of the corresponding projective spaces via: ::[v] ‚Üí [T(v)], where v is a non-zero element of V and [...] denotes the equivalence classes of a vector under the defining identification of the respective projective spaces. Since members of the equivalence class differ by a scalar factor, and linear maps preserve scalar factors, this induced map is well-defined. (If T is not injective, it has a null space larger than {0}; in this case the meaning of the class of T(v) is problematic if v is non-zero and in the null space. In this case one obtains a so-called rational map, see also birational geometry). Two linear maps S and T in induce the same map between P(V) and P(W) if and only if they differ by a scalar multiple, that is if for some . Thus if one identifies the scalar multiples of the identity map with the underlying field K, the set of K-linear morphisms from P(V) to P(W) is simply . The automorphisms can be described more concretely. (We deal only with automorphisms preserving the base field K). Using the notion of sheaves generated by global sections, it can be shown that any algebraic (not necessarily linear) automorphism must be linear, i.e., coming from a (linear) automorphism of the vector space V. The latter form the group GL(V). By identifying maps that differ by a scalar, one concludes that :Aut(P(V)) = Aut(V)/K√ó = GL(V)/K√ó =: PGL(V), the quotient group of GL(V) modulo the matrices that are scalar multiples of the identity. (These matrices form the center of Aut(V).) The groups PGL are called projective linear groups. The automorphisms of the complex projective line P1(C) are called M√∂bius transformations. Dual projective space When the construction above is applied to the dual space V‚àó rather than V, one obtains the dual projective space, which can be canonically identified with the space of hyperplanes through the origin of V. That is, if V is n dimensional, then P(V‚àó) is the Grassmannian of planes in V. In algebraic geometry, this construction allows for greater flexibility in the construction of projective bundles. One would like to be able associate a projective space to every quasi-coherent sheaf E over a scheme Y, not just the locally free ones. See EGAII, Chap. II, par. 4 for more details. Generalizations ;dimension: The projective space, being the \\"space\\" of all one-dimensional linear subspaces of a given vector space V is generalized to Grassmannian manifold, which is parametrizing higher-dimensional subspaces (of some fixed dimension) of V. ;sequence of subspaces: More generally flag manifold is the space of flags, i.e., chains of linear subspaces of V. ;other subvarieties: Even more generally, moduli spaces parametrize objects such as elliptic curves of a given kind. ;other rings: Generalizing to associative rings (rather than only fields) yields, for example, the projective line over a ring. ;patching: Patching projective spaces together yields projective space bundles. Severi‚ÄìBrauer varieties are algebraic varieties over a field k, which become isomorphic to projective spaces after an extension of the base field k. Another generalization of projective spaces are weighted projective spaces; these are themselves special cases of toric varieties.

Structure The superior vena cava is formed by the left and right brachiocephalic or innominate veins, which receive blood from the upper limbs, eyes and neck, behind the lower border of the first right costal cartilage. It passes vertically downwards behind first intercostal space and receives azygos vein just before it pierces the fibrous pericardium opposite right second costal cartilage and its lower part is intrapericardial. And then, it ends in the upper and posterior part of the sinus venarum of the right atrium, at the upper right front portion of the heart. It is also known as the cranial vena cava in other animals. No valve divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium. Clinical significance Superior vena cava obstruction refers to a partial or complete obstruction of the superior vena cava, typically in the context of cancer such as a cancer of the lung, metastatic cancer, or lymphoma. Obstruction can lead to enlarged veins in the head and neck, and may also cause breathlessness, cough, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. Pemberton's sign may be positive. Tumours causing obstruction may be treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to reduce their effects, and corticosteroids may also be given. In tricuspid valve regurgitation, these pulsations are very strong. No valve divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium. As a result, the (right) atrial and (right) ventricular contractions are conducted up into the internal jugular vein and, through the sternocleidomastoid muscle, can be seen as the jugular venous pressure.

In 1968, Lord co-founded Deep Purple, a hard rock band of which he was regarded as the leader until 1970. Together with the other members, he collaborated on most of his band's most popular songs. He and drummer Ian Paice were the only continuous presence in the band during the period from 1968 to 1976, and also from when it was reestablished in 1984 until Lord's retirement from Deep Purple in 2002. On 11 November 2010, he was inducted as an Honorary Fellow of Stevenson College in Edinburgh, Scotland. On 15 July 2011, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree at De Montfort Hall by the University of Leicester. Lord was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 8 April 2016 as a member of Deep Purple.\\"Deep Purple Rocks Hall of Fame With Hits-Filled Set\\". Rolling Stone. Retrieved 13 April 2016 Early life =Growing up in Leicester= Lord was born in Leicester on 9 June 1941 to Miriam (1909‚Äì1995; n√©e Hudson) and Reginald Lord, growing up at 120 Averil Road and retaining a strong bond with the city throughout his life. His father was an amateur saxophonist and encouraged Lord from an early age. He studied classical piano from the age of five, with a local teacher, Frederick Allt, and this focus on a classical grounding to his material was a recurring trademark in his work, both in composition, arranging and his instrumental solos on piano, organ and electronic keyboards. In particular his influences ranged from Johann Sebastian Bach (a constant reference in his music and in his keyboard improvisation) to Medieval popular music and the English tradition of Edward Elgar. He attended Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys between 1952 and 1958 where he gained O Level passes in French, music and mathematics, participated in amateur dramatics and the school choir alongside his organ and piano studies and then worked as a clerk in a solicitor's office for two years. Lord absorbed the blues sounds that played a key part in his rock career, principally the raw sounds of the great American blues organists Jimmy Smith, Jimmy McGriff and \\"Brother\\" Jack McDuff (\\"Rock Candy\\"), as well as the stage showmanship of Jerry Lee Lewis and performers like Buddy Holly, whom he saw perform at the De Montfort Hall in Leicester in March 1958. The jazz-blues organ style of black R&B; organ players in the 1950s and 1960s, using the trademark blues-organ sound of the Hammond organ (B3 and C3 models) and combining it with the Leslie speaker system (the well-known Hammond-Leslie speaker combination), were seminal influences on Lord. Lord also stated that he was heavily influenced by the organ-based progressive rock played by Vanilla Fudge after seeing that band perform in Great Britain in 1967, and earlier by the personal direction he received from British organ pioneer Graham Bond.Welch, Chris. \\"The Story of Deep Purple.\\" In Deep Purple: HM Photo Book, copyright 1983, Omnibus Press. =Move to London= Lord moved to London in 1959‚Äì60, intent on an acting career and enrolling at the Central School of Speech and Drama, in London's Swiss Cottage. Following a celebrated student rebellion he became a founder of Drama Centre London, from where he graduated in 1964. Small acting parts followed, including in the British TV series, Emergency - Ward 10 and Lord continued playing the piano and the organ in nightclubs and as a session musician to earn a living. He started his band career in London in 1960 with the jazz ensemble The Bill Ashton Combo. Ashton became a key figure in jazz education in Britain, creating what later became the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Between 1960 and 1963, Lord and Ashton both moved on to Red Bludd's Bluesicians (also known as The Don Wilson Quartet), the latter of which featured the singer Arthur \\"Art\\" Wood, brother of guitarist Ronnie Wood. Wood had previously sung with Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated and was a junior figure in the British blues movement. In this period, Lord altered the spelling of his name from his birth name \\"John\\" to \\"Jon\\" and his session credits included playing the keyboards in \\"You Really Got Me\\", The Kinks number one hit of 1964 however in a Guitar World interview Ray Davies of The Kinks stated it was actually Arthur Greenslade playing piano on that particular track. Following the break-up of Redd Bludd's Bluesicians in late 1963, Wood, Lord, and the drummer Red Dunnage put together a new band, The Art Wood Combo. This also included Derek Griffiths (guitar) and Malcolm Pool (bass guitar). Dunnage left in December 1964 to be replaced by Keef Hartley, who had previously replaced Ringo Starr in Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. This band, later known as \\"The Artwoods\\", focused on the organ as the bluesy, rhythmic core of their sound, in common with the contemporary bands The Spencer Davis Group (Steve Winwood on organ) and The Animals (with Alan Price). They made appearances on the BBC's Saturday Club radio show and on such TV programs as Ready Steady Go!. It also performed abroad, and it appeared on the first Ready Steady Goes Live, promoting its first single the Lead Belly song \\"Sweet Mary\\" ‚Äî but significant commercial success eluded it. Its only charting single was \\"I Take What I Want\\", which reached number 28 on 8 May 1966. This band regrouped in 1967 as the \\"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\\". This was an attempt to cash in on the 1930s gangster craze set off by the American film Bonnie and Clyde. Hartley left the band in 1967 to join John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Lord next founded the \\"Santa Barbara Machine Head\\", featuring Art's brother, Ronnie Wood, writing and recording three powerful keyboard-driven instrumental tracks, giving a preview of the future style of Deep Purple. Soon thereafter, Lord went on to cover for the keyboard player Billy Day in The Flower Pot Men, where he met the bass guitarist Nick Simper along with drummer Carlo Little and guitarist Ged Peck. Lord and Simper then toured with this band in 1967 to promote its hit single \\"Let's Go to San Francisco\\", but the two men never recorded with this band. =Formation of Deep Purple= In early 1967, through his roommate Chris Curtis of the Searchers, Lord met businessman Tony Edwards who was looking to invest in the music business alongside partners Ron Hire and John Coletta (HEC Enterprises). Session guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was called in and he met Lord for the first time, but Chris Curtis's erratic behaviour led the trio nowhere. Edwards was impressed enough by Jon Lord to ask him to form a band after Curtis faded out. Said Edwards, \\"I couldn't really cope with [Curtis] but I had a great rapport with Jon Lord; here was somebody sensible, somebody I could communicate with on my level.\\"Tyler, Kieron On The Roundabout With Deep Purple Retrieved 31 August 2020 Simper was contacted, and Blackmore was recalled from Hamburg. Although top British player Bobbie Clarke was the first choice as drummer, during the auditions for a singer, Rod Evans of \\"The Maze\\" came in with his own drummer, Ian Paice. Blackmore, who had been impressed by Paice's drumming when he met him in 1967, set up an audition for Paice as well. The band was called the \\"Roundabout\\" at first and began rehearsals at Deeves Hall in Hertfordshire. By March 1968, this became the \\"Mark 1\\" line-up of \\"Deep Purple\\": Lord, Simper, Blackmore, Paice, and Evans. Lord also helped form the band \\"Boz\\" with some of its recordings being produced by Derek Lawrence. \\"Boz\\" included Boz Burrell (later of King Crimson and Bad Company), Blackmore (guitarist), Paice (drummer), Chas Hodges (bass guitarist). Deep Purple =1968‚Äì1970= It was in these three years that Lord's trademark keyboard sound emerged. Ignoring the emergence of the Moog synthesizer, as pioneered in rock by such players as Keith Emerson, Lord began experimenting with a keyboard sound produced by driving the Hammond organ through Marshall speakers in an effort to match the attack and volume of Blackmore's guitar. Lord's version was heavier than a blues sound, and it often featured distortion and a far harder, industrial type sound that became the trademark Jon Lord organ sound, admired by fans and peers alike but rarely replicated. Both Emerson and Rick Wakeman publicly expressed admiration for Lord's mould-breaking work on the organ. This delivered a rhythmic foundation to complement Blackmore's speed and virtuosity on lead guitar. Lord also loved the sound of an RMI 368 Electra-Piano and Harpsichord, which he used on such songs as \\"Demon's Eye\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\". In 1973 Lord's original Hammond C3 gave out and he bought another from Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Also around this time, Lord and his keyboard technician, Mike Phillips, combined his Hammond C3 Organ with the RMI. Lord kept this particular Hammond C3 until his retirement from the band in 2002, when he passed it to successor Don Airey. That instrument was retired from stage use a few years later, as it had become \\"pretty knackered\\" according to Airey. Lord pushed the Hammond-Leslie sound through Marshall amplification, creating a growling, heavy, mechanical sound which allowed Lord to compete with Blackmore as a soloist, with an organ that sounded as prominent as the lead guitar. Said one reviewer, \\"many have tried to imitate [Lord's] style, and all failed.\\" Said Lord himself, \\"There's a way of playing a Hammond [that's] different. A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that you can play a Hammond with a piano technique. Well, you can, but it sounds like you are playing a Hammond with a piano technique. Really, you have to learn how to play an organ. It's a legato technique; it's a technique to achieve legato on a non-legato instrument.\\" In early Deep Purple recordings, Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band. Despite the cover songs \\"Hush\\" and \\"Kentucky Woman\\" becoming hits in North America, Deep Purple never made chart success in the UK until the Concerto for Group and Orchestra album (1970). Lord's willingness later to play many of the key rhythm parts gave Blackmore the freedom to let loose both live and on record. On Deep Purple's second and third albums, Lord began indulging his ambition to fuse rock with classical music. An early example of this is the song \\"Anthem\\" from the album The Book of Taliesyn (1968), but a more prominent example is the song \\"April\\" from the band's self-titled third album (1969). The song is recorded in three parts: 1. Lord and Blackmore only, on keyboards and acoustic guitar, respectively; 2. an orchestral arrangement complete with strings; and 3. the full rock band with vocals. Lord's ambition enhanced his reputation among fellow musicians, but caused tension within the group. Simper later said, \\"The reason the music lacked direction was Jon Lord fucked everything up with his classical ideas.\\" Blackmore agreed to go along with Lord's experimentation, provided he was given his head on the next band album. The resulting Concerto For Group and Orchestra (in 1969) was one of rock's earliest attempts to fuse two distinct musical idioms. Performed live at the Royal Albert Hall on 24 September 1969 (with new band members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, Evans and Simper having been fired), it was recorded by the BBC and later released as an album. The Concerto gave Deep Purple its first highly publicised taste of mainstream fame and gave Lord the confidence to believe that his experiment and his compositional skill had a future, as well as giving Lord the opportunity to work with established classical figures, such as conductor Sir Malcolm Arnold, who brought his skills to bear by helping Lord realise the work and to protect him from the inevitable disdain of the older members of the orchestra. =1970‚Äì1976= Lord with Deep Purple on tour at the Niedersachsenhalle, Hanover, Germany, 1970 Purple began work on Deep Purple in Rock, released by their new label Harvest in 1970 and now recognised as one of hard rock's key early works. Lord and Blackmore competed to out- dazzle each other, often in classical-style, midsection 'call and answer' improvisation (on tracks like \\"Speed King\\"), something they employed to great effect live. Ian Gillan said that Lord provided the idea on the main organ riff for \\"Child in Time\\" although the riff was also based on It's a Beautiful Day's 1969 psychedelic hit song \\"Bombay Calling\\". Lord's experimental solo on \\"Hard Lovin' Man\\" (complete with police-siren interpolation) from this album was his personal favourite among his Deep Purple studio performances. Deep Purple released another six studio albums between 1971 (Fireball) and 1975 (Come Taste the Band). Gillan and Glover left in 1973 and Blackmore in 1975, and the band disintegrated in 1976. The highlights of Lord's Purple work in the period include the 1972 album Machine Head (featuring his rhythmic underpinnings on \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\", plus the organ solos on \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Pictures of Home\\" and \\"Lazy\\"), the sonic bombast of the Made in Japan live album (1972), an extended, effect-laden solo on \\"Rat Bat Blue\\" from the Who Do We Think We Are album (1973), and his overall playing on the Burn album from 1974. Roger Glover would later describe Lord as a true \\"Zen-archer soloist\\", someone whose best keyboard improvisation often came at the first attempt. Lord's strict reliance on the Hammond C3 organ sound, as opposed to the synthesizer experimentation of his contemporaries, places him firmly in the jazz-blues category as a band musician and far from the progressive-rock sound of Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman. Lord rarely ventured into the synthesizer territory on Purple albums, often limiting his experimentation to the use of the ring modulator with the Hammond, to give live performances on tracks like Space Truckin' a distinctive 'spacy' sound. Instances of his Deep Purple synthesizer use (he became an endorser of the ARP Oyssey) include \\"'A' 200\\", the final track from Burn, and \\"Love Child\\" on the Come Taste the Band album. In early 1973 Lord stated: \\"We're as valid as anything by Beethoven.\\" As a composer Lord continued to focus on his classical aspirations alongside his Deep Purple career. The BBC, buoyed by the success of the Concerto, commissioned him to write another piece and the resulting \\"Gemini Suite\\" was performed by Deep Purple and the Light Music Society under Malcolm Arnold at the Royal Festival Hall in September 1970, and then in Munich with the Kammerorchester conducted by Eberhard Schoener in January 1972. It then became the basis for Lord's first solo album, Gemini Suite, released in November 1972, with vocals by Yvonne Elliman and Tony Ashton and with the London Symphony Orchestra backing a band that included Albert Lee on guitar. Lord's collaboration with the highly experimental and supportive Schoener resulted in a second live performance of the Suite in late 1973 and a new Lord album with Schoener, entitled Windows, in 1974. It proved to be Lord's most experimental work and was released to mixed reactions. However, the dalliances with Bach on Windows and the pleasure of collaborating with Schoener resulted in perhaps Lord's most confident solo work and perhaps his strongest orchestral album, Sarabande, recorded in Germany in September 1975 with the Philharmonia Hungarica conducted by Schoener. Composed of eight pieces (from the opening sweep of Fantasia to the Finale), at least five pieces form the typical construction of a baroque dance suite. The key pieces (Sarabande, Gigue, Bouree, Pavane and Caprice) feature rich orchestration complemented sometimes by the interpolation of rock themes, played by a session band comprising Pete York, Mark Nauseef and Andy Summers, with organ and synthesizers played by Lord. In March 1974, Lord and Paice had collaborated with friend Tony Ashton on First of the Big Bands, credited to 'Tony Ashton & Jon Lord' and featuring a rich array of session talent, including Carmine Appice, Ian Paice, Peter Frampton and Pink Floyd saxophonist/sessioner, Dick Parry. They performed much of the set live at the London Palladium in September 1974. This formed the basis of Lord's first post-Deep Purple project Paice Ashton Lord, which lasted only a year and spawned a single album, Malice in Wonderland in 1977, recorded at Musicland Studios at the Arabella Hotel in Munich. A second album was begun but subsequently abandoned. He created an informal group of friends and collaborators including Ashton, Paice, Bernie Marsden, Boz Burrell and later, Bad Company's Mick Ralphs, Simon Kirke and others. Over the same period, Lord guested on albums by Maggie Bell, Nazareth and even folk artist Richard Digance. He also guested as one of several keyboard players on the live performance of David Bedford‚Äôs The Odyssey at the Royal Albert Hall in 1977. Eager to pay off a huge tax bill upon his return the UK in the late-1970s (Purple's excesses included their own tour jet and a home Lord rented in Malibu from actress Ann-Margret and where he wrote the Sarabande album), Lord joined former Deep Purple band member David Coverdale's new band, Whitesnake in August 1978 (Ian Paice joined them in 1980 and stayed till 1982). Whitesnake, 1978‚Äì1984 Lord's job in Whitesnake was largely limited to adding colour (or, in his own words, a 'halo') to round out a blues-rock sound that already accommodated two lead guitarists, Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody. He added a Yamaha CP-70 electric piano to his set-up and finally a huge bank of synthesizers onstage courtesy of Moog (Minimoog, Opus, Polymoog) so he could play the 12-bar blues the band often required and recreate string section and other effects. Such varied work is evident on tracks like \\"Here I Go Again\\", \\"Wine, Women and Song\\", \\"She's a Woman\\" and \\"Till the Day I Die\\". A number of singles entered the UK chart, taking the now 30-something Lord onto Top of the Pops with regularity between 1980 and 1983. He later expressed frustration that he was a poorly paid hired-hand, but fans saw little of this discord and Whitesnake's commercial success kept him at the forefront of readers' polls as heavy rock's foremost keyboard maestro. His dissatisfaction (and Coverdale's eagerness to revamp the band's line-up and lower the average age to help crack the US market) smoothed the way for the reformation of Deep Purple Mk II in 1984. Jon Lord's last Whitesnake concert took place in the Swedish TV programme M√•ndagsb√∂rsen on 16 April 1984. During his tenure in Whitesnake, Lord had the opportunity to record two distinctly different solo albums. 1982s Before I Forget featured a largely conventional eight-song line- up, no orchestra and with the bulk of the songs being either mainstream rock tracks (\\"Hollywood Rock And Roll\\", \\"Chance on a Feeling\\"), or ‚Äì specifically on side two ‚Äì a series of very English classical piano ballads sung by the mother and daughter duo Vicki Brown and Sam Brown (wife and daughter of entertainer Joe Brown) and vocalist Elmer Gantry as well as piano and synthesiser instrumentals such as Burntwood, named after Lord's stately Oxfordshire home at the time. The album also boasted the cream of British rock talent, including the session drummer (and National Youth Jazz Orchestra alumnus) Simon Phillips, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray, Simon Kirke, Boz Burrell and Mick Ralphs. Additionally, Lord was commissioned by producer Patrick Gamble for Central Television to write the soundtrack for their 1984 TV series, Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady, based on the book by Edith Holden, with an orchestra conducted by Alfred Ralston and with a distinctly gentle, pastoral series of themes composed by Lord. Lord became firmly established as a member of UK rock's \\"Oxfordshire mansion aristocracy\\" ‚Äì with a home, Burntwood Hall, set in at Goring-on-Thames, complete with its own cricket pitch and a hand-painted Challen baby grand piano, previously owned by Shirley Bassey. He was asked to guest on albums by friends George Harrison (Gone Troppo from 1982) and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour (1984's About Face), Cozy Powell (Octopuss in 1983) and to play on an adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's classic, Wind in the Willows. He composed and produced the score for White Fire (1984), which consisted largely of two songs performed by Limelight. In 1985 he made a brief appearance as a member of The Singing Rebel's band (which also featured Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) in the Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais-scripted film Water (1985) (Handmade Films). In the 1980s he was also a member of an all-star band called Olympic Rock & Blues Circus fronted by Pete York and featuring a rotating line-up of the likes of Miller Anderson, Tony Ashton, Brian Auger, Zoot Money, Colin Hodgkinson, Chris Farlowe and many others. Olympic Rock & Blues Circus toured primarily in Germany between 1981 and 1989. Some musicians, including Lord, took part in York's TV musical extravaganza Superdrumming between 1987 and 1989. Later work, 1984‚Äì2006 Lord's re-emergence with Deep Purple in 1984 resulted in huge audiences for the reformed Mk II line-up, including 1985‚Äôs second largest grossing tour in the US and an appearance in front of 80,000 rain-soaked fans headlining Knebworth on 22 June 1985, all to support the Perfect Strangers album. Playing with a rejuvenated Mk. II Purple line-up (including spells at a health farm to get the band including Lord into shape) and being onstage and in the studio with Blackmore, gave Lord the chance to push himself once again. His 'rubato' classical opening sequence to the album's opener, \\"Knocking at Your Back Door\\" (complete with F-Minor to G polychordal harmony sequence), gave Lord the chance to do his most powerful work for years, including the song \\"Perfect Strangers\\". Further Deep Purple albums followed, often of varying quality, and by the late-1990s, Lord was clearly keen to explore new avenues for his musical career. Lord performing for The Sunflower Jam, London, 2007 In 1997, he created perhaps his most personal work to date, Pictured Within, released in 1998 with a European tour to support it. Lord's mother Miriam had died in August 1995 and the album is inflected at all stages by Lord's sense of grief. Recorded largely in Lord's home-away-from-home, the city of Cologne, the album's themes are Elgarian and alpine in equal measure. Lord signed to Virgin Classics to release it, and perhaps saw it as the first stage in his eventual departure from Purple to embark on a low-key and altogether more gentle solo career. One song from Pictured Within, entitled \\"Wait A While\\" was later covered by Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb√∏ on her 2003/2004 album My Heart. Lord finally retired from Deep Purple amicably in 2002, preceded by a knee injury that eventually resolved itself without surgery. He said subsequently, \\"Leaving Deep Purple was just as traumatic as I had always suspected it would be and more so ‚Äì if you see what I mean\\". He even dedicated a song to it on 2004's solo effort, Beyond the Notes, called \\"De Profundis\\". The album was recorded in Bonn with producer between June and July 2004. Tony Ashton (right) with Lord at a gig at the Hotel Post, March 1990 Pictured Within and Beyond the Notes provide the most personal work by Lord. He collaborated with former ABBA superstar and family friend Frida (Anni-Frid Lyngstad) on the 2004 track, \\"The Sun Will Shine Again\\" (with lyrics by Sam Brown), and performed with her across Europe. He subsequently also performed European concerts to premi√®re the 2007-scheduled orchestral piece Boom of the Tingling Strings. In 2003 he also returned to his beloved R-n-B/blues heritage to record an album of standards in Sydney, with Australia's Jimmy Barnes, entitled Live in the Basement, by Jon Lord and the Hoochie Coochie Men. Lord was also happy to support the Sam Buxton Sunflower Jam Healing Trust and in September 2006, performed at a star-studded event to support the charity led by Ian Paice's wife, Jacky (twin sister of Lord's wife Vicky). Featured artists on stage with Lord included Paul Weller, Robert Plant, Phil Manzanera, Ian Paice and Bernie Marsden. Final work, after 2006 Two Lord compositions, Boom of the Tingling Strings and \\"Disguises (Suite for String Orchestra)\\", were recorded in Denmark in 2006 and released in April 2008 on EMI Classics. Both featured the Odense Symfoniorkester, conducted by Paul Mann. Additionally, a second Hoochie Coochie Men album was recorded in July 2006 in London. This album, Danger ‚Äì White Men Dancing, was released in October 2007. His Durham Concerto, commissioned by Durham University for its 175th anniversary celebrations, received its world premiere on 20 October 2007 in Durham Cathedral by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and featured soloists Lord on Hammond Organ, Kathryn Tickell on Northumbrian pipes, Matthew Barley on cello and Ruth Palmer on violin. It became a hit in Classic FM's \\"Hall of Fame\\", alongside his piano concerto Boom of the Tingling Strings. Lord played piano on George Harrison's posthumously released Brainwashed album (2002) and became an important member of Harrison's social circle in Oxfordshire (Lord by now living at Hill House, in Fawley, Henley-On-Thames), the two having first met at Abbey Road studios in the late 1960s. He was also a close friend of Sir John Mortimer, the English barrister, dramatist, screenwriter, author and creator of British television series Rumpole of the Bailey, whom he had accompanied on many occasions during Mortimer's performances of \\"Mortimer Miscellany.\\" In 2007, Lord joined Derek Griffiths, Colin Martin and Malcolm Pool at an Artwoods reunion at the ART Tribute night, at York House in Twickenham. Ali Mackenzie took over Art Wood's role on vocals, and Chris Hunt played drums. They were joined on stage by guitarist Ronnie Wood and vocalist Geno Washington. Lord released his solo album To Notice Such Things on 29 March 2010. Titled after the main work‚Äîa six movement suite for solo flute, piano and string orchestra‚Äîthe album was inspired by, and was dedicated to the memory of Jon's dear friend John Mortimer, who died in January 2009. On its first day of release, the album entered Amazon's Movers And Shakers index, nestling at No. 12 at the end of the day. Six days later it entered the UK's official classical chart at No. 4. Lord had been commissioned to compose a concerto for Hammond organ and orchestra with special parts for tympani. The piece was to be premiered with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra with Tom Vissgren on tympani in Oslo, Norway in the Spring of 2012. With Vladimir Ashkenazy and Josef Suk, Lord was one of three artistic sponsors of Toccata Classics. In July 2011, Lord performed his final live concert appearance, the Sunflower Jam at the Royal Albert Hall, where he premiered his joint composition with Rick Wakeman. At that point, they had begun informal discussion on recording an album together. Up until 2011, Lord had also been working on material with recently formed rock supergroup WhoCares, also featuring singer Ian Gillan from Deep Purple, guitarist Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath, second guitarist Mikko Lindstr√∂m from HIM, bassist Jason Newsted formerly from Metallica and drummer Nicko McBrain from Iron Maiden, specifically the composition \\"Out of My Mind,\\" in addition to new compositions with Steve Balsamo and a Hammond Organ Concerto. Lord subsequently cancelled a performance of his Durham Concerto in Hagen, Germany, for what his website said was a continuation of his medical treatment (the concert, scheduled for 6 July 2012, would have been his return to live performance after treatment). Lord's Concerto for Group and Orchestra was effectively recommissioned by him, recorded in Liverpool and at Abbey Road Studios across 2011 and under post-production in 2012 with the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra performing, conducted by long-time collaborator, conductor Paul Mann. The recording was at completion at the time of Lord's death, with Lord having been able to review the final master recordings. The album and DVD were subsequently released in 2012. Personal life Lord's first marriage, from 1969 to 1981, was to Judith Feldman, with whom he had one daughter, Sara. Lord's second wife, Vickie Gibbs, was a former girlfriend of Purple bandmate Glenn Hughes and twin sister of Ian Paice's wife, Jacky Paice (founder of the charity Sunflower Jam). The sisters' father was Frank Gibbs, owner of the Oakley House Country Club in Brewood, South Staffordshire. Jon and Vickie also had one daughter, Amy. In July 2011, Lord was found to be suffering from pancreatic cancer. After treatment in both England and in Israel, he died on 16 July 2012 at the London Clinic after suffering from a pulmonary embolism. His interment was at the new churchyard of Saint Mary the Virgin Church in Hambleden. Influence and legacy Lars Ulrich, founding member and drummer in Metallica commented, \\"Ever since my father took me to see them in 1973 in Copenhagen, at the impressionable age of 9, Deep Purple has been the most constant, continuous and inspiring musical presence in my life. They have meant more to me than any other band in existence, and have had an enormous part in shaping who I am. We can all be guilty of lightly throwing adjectives like 'unique,' 'one-of-a-kind' and 'pioneering' around when we want to describe our heroes and the people who've moved us, but there are no more fitting words than those right now and there simply was no musician like Jon Lord in the history of hard rock. Nobody. Period. There was nobody that played like him. There was nobody that sounded like him. There was nobody that wrote like him. There was nobody that looked like him. There was nobody more articulate, gentlemanly, warm, or fucking cooler that ever played keyboards or got anywhere near a keyboard. What he did was all his own.\\" Interviewed in 2012 for Blabbermouth.net, Mot√∂rhead frontman Lemmy said: \\"It's just a shame, because Jon Lord was, to a large extent, responsible for me being in rock and roll. He was in a band called the Artwoods years ago, with Ronnie Wood‚Äôs brother Arthur. They were sort of a jazz-blues band, I guess. They played at the place in Wales where I was living, this dingy little boozer, and I was talking to Jon and, like an idiot, he gave me his address in London. So, of course, I went down there and he wasn't there, but he was living at Art‚Äôs mother's house where Ronnie Wood who was in a band called The Birds was living and they let me crash on the couch.... I saw him late last year in a hotel in Germany in Cologne. He was over there doing some orchestral stuff, and we talked in the bar for awhile... I'm glad I saw him, since he's since departed.\\" Former keyboard player of rock band Yes, Rick Wakeman, who was a friend of Lord's, said he was \\"a great fan\\" and added \\"We were going to write and record an album before he became ill. His contribution to music and to classic rock was immeasurable and I will miss him terribly.\\" In mid-2013, Wakeman presented a BBC One East Midlands-produced TV programme about Lord and his connection to the town of his birth. Singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad (ABBA), who described Jon Lord as her \\"dearest friend\\", paid him tribute at the 2013 edition of Zermatt Unplugged, the annual music festival which both he and she served as patrons. \\"He was graceful, intelligent, polite, with a strong integrity,\\" she said. \\"(He) had a strong empathy and a great deal of humour for his own and other people's weaknesses.\\" Keyboardist Keith Emerson said of Lord's death, \\"Jon left us now but his music and inspiration will live forever. I am deeply saddened by his departure.\\" In a later interview in November 2013, he added, \\"In the early years I remember being quite jealous of Jon Lord ‚Äì may he rest in peace. In September 1969 I heard he was debuting his \\"Concerto For Group & Orchestra\\" at the Royal Albert Hall, with none other than Malcolm Arnold conducting. Wow! I had to go along and see that. Jon and I ribbed each other, we were pretty much pals, but I walked away and thought: 'Shit, in a couple of weeks' time I'm going to be recording The Nice's Five Bridges Suite ... not at the Albert Hall but at the Fairfield Halls, Croydon!' A much more prosaic venue. Later, Jon wanted me to play on his solo album, Gemini Suite, but that was around the time ELP were breaking big and we were touring. He was a lovely guy, a real gentleman.\\" A concert tribute to Lord took place on 4 April 2014 at the Royal Albert Hall. Performers and presenters included Deep Purple, Bruce Dickinson, Alfie Boe, Jeremy Irons, Joe Brown, Glenn Hughes, Miller Anderson and Steve Balsamo. In December 2012 the Mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, joined the campaign to honour Lord with a blue plaque at his childhood home at 120 Averill Road, where he lived until he was twenty, saying it would be \\"an important reminder of the city's contribution to the world of contemporary music.\\" Lord was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple in April 2016.

Born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, King attended Wolverhampton Grammar School and studied economics at King's College, Cambridge, St John's College, Cambridge, and Harvard University. He then worked as a researcher on the Cambridge Growth Project, taught at the University of Birmingham, Harvard and MIT, and became a Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics. He joined the Bank of England in 1990 as a non-executive director, and became the chief economist in 1991. In 1998, he became a deputy governor of the bank and a member of the Group of Thirty. King was appointed as Governor of the Bank of England in 2003, succeeding Edward George. Most notably, he oversaw the bank during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and the Great Recession. King retired from his office as governor in June 2013, and was succeeded by Mark Carney. He was appointed a life peer and entered the House of Lords as a crossbencher in July 2013. Since September 2014 he has served as a professor of economics and law with a joint appointment at New York University's Stern School of Business and School of Law. Early life and pre-bank career Mervyn King is a son of Eric King, a railway porter who retrained as a geography teacher after the war, and Kathleen (n√©e Passingham). He was born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, and studied at Warstones Junior School Wolverhampton and then on to Wolverhampton Grammar School, King's College, Cambridge (gaining a first-class degree in economics in 1969; MA), St John's College, Cambridge, and Harvard (as a Kennedy Scholar).Bank of England profile ; accessed 2 March 2011. Whilst at Cambridge, King was treasurer of the Cambridge University Liberal Club in 1968.Profile, keynessociety.wordpress.com; accessed 30- March 2015. After graduation, he worked as a researcher on the Cambridge Growth Project with future Nobel Laureate Richard Stone and Terry Barker at the University of Cambridge. He then taught at the University of Birmingham and was a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT where he shared an office with then Assistant Professor Ben Bernanke. From October 1984 he was Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics where he founded the Financial Markets Group. In 1981, he was one of the 364 economists who signed a letter to The Times condemning Geoffrey Howe's 1981 Budget. Bank of England King joined the bank in March 1991 as chief economist and executive director, after being a non-executive director from 1990 to 1991. He was appointed Deputy Governor in 1997, taking up his post on 1 June 1998. In the same year, King became a member of the Group of Thirty. An ex-officio member of the bank's interest- rate setting Monetary Policy Committee since its inception in 1997, King took part in its monthly meetings. He succeeded Sir Edward George as governor on 1 July 2003, and was also the first incumbent governor of the Bank of England to be received in audience with Queen Elizabeth II. =Late 2000s financial crisis= After becoming Bank governor, King explained that Bank of England policy was \\"similar to that of the Federal Reserve\\" under Alan Greenspan. Greenspan described his approach as \\"mitigat[ing] the fallout [from the bursting of a bubble] when it occurs\\". King agreed with Alan Greenspan that, \\"It is hard to identify asset price 'bubbles'.\\" Other warnings about the UK housing market followed, including from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in 2004 and the OECD in 2005. King noted the \\"unusually large\\" difference between the RPIX and CPI at the beginning of 2004 (the latter does not include house prices as part of its inflation measure, whilst the former does), and, six months later, that UK house prices had risen \\"to levels which are well above what most people would regard as sustainable in the longer term\\", having increased by more than 20% over the preceding year and more than 100% over the preceding five. In 2005, The Economist described the run-up in UK house prices as forming part of \\"the biggest bubble in history\\", and, by October 2007‚Äîwhen the UK housing bubble was at its peak ‚Äî the IMF was reporting that the UK housing market was \\"overpriced by up to 40 per cent\\". As noted by the OECD, house-price volatility \\"can raise systemic risks as the banking and mortgage sectors are vulnerable to fluctuations in house prices due to their exposure to the housing market.\\" Dean Baker in The American Prospect said the failure by Greenspan and King to tackle the bubbles in their respective countries' housing markets resulted in catastrophic \\"fallout\\" when the bubbles burst, resulting in the worst recessions in both countries since the Great Depression. UK‚ÄìUS inaction may be compared to action taken by China. and Australia. Another result of the financial crisis was King's rejection of the bank's devout focus on price stability, or inflation targeting, a policy that was instituted after Black Wednesday in 1992 and that was continued by King after becoming governor in 2003. One of the two early lessons King drew from crisis were that \\"price stability does not guarantee stability of the economy as a whole\\" and that \\"the instruments used to pursue financial stability are in need of sharpening and refining.\\" The 2012 Financial Services Bill, in transferring the majority of macroprudential regulatory powers from the FSA to the bank, will grant the Financial Policy Committee (chaired by King) the power to curb lending in booms, including placing limits on the public's access to mortgages. A former, senior BoE official summed up the bank's pre-crisis performance: \\"How can you look back with the benefit of hindsight and see it as a success? We were responsible for financial stability and we utterly failed to take any avoiding action against the greatest financial crisis in our lifetimes\\". David Blanchflower said that, even as late as the summer of 2008, King did not even see the financial crisis coming. In its review of Bank of England accountability, one of the major complaints of the Treasury Select Committee was the bank's refusal to undertake an internal review of its performance during the financial crisis. Such a review would pose difficulties since evidence on how its most senior policymakers arrived at their decisions was destroyed as a matter of course. By contrast, the United States publishes the Federal Reserve's deliberations with a five-year lag, which have provided \\"the most detailed picture yet of how top officials at the central bank didn't anticipate the storm about to hit the U.S. economy and the global financial system.\\" As in the UK, the US central bank's failure led to a new regulatory framework, the 2010 Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Response to crisis King argued that when the financial crisis and bank meltdown hit in autumn 2008, he and other Western central bankers \\"prevented a Great Depression\\", in part by cutting interest rates to virtually zero. The Economist agreed, saying that he \\"has a point\\". A 2012 review of actions taken by Western central banks in the face of the crisis also supported King's claim. The bank has faced criticism, however, for the pace of the rate cuts, which took five months from the beginning of October 2008 to get down from 5.0% to 0.5%, where they remained for several years. King abandoned his institution's remit on keeping inflation around 2%. After becoming only the second Bank of England governor to speak to the TUC in its 142-year history, King conceded that people were \\"entitled to be angry\\" about unemployment and the bank bailout. King has been scathing about the banking sector since it crashed, especially its \\"breathtaking\\" ¬£1 trillion bailout and its continuation of bonus awards in 2009, calling for a serious review of banking's structure and regulation. In a The Daily Telegraph interview in March 2011, King said banks had \\"put profits before people\\", that failure to reform the sector could result in another financial crisis, and that traditional manufacturing industries have a more \\"moral\\" way of operating. In an interview with The Times in March 2012, he said that the banks are still in denial about the \\"very real and wholly understandable\\" anger that is felt at their behaviour, Bankers have not been happy with his excoriating views and insistence on avoiding moral hazard, but King insists that \\"[m]arket discipline can't apply to everyone except banks\\", pinpointing the banks' sense of grievance on their finding it \\"very, very difficult to face up to the failure of their banking model\\". With King's term as governor ending in 2013, top UK banks have warned that unless a less \\"hostile\\" figure is found as a successor, they may feel it necessary to move abroad. On 26 November 2012, Mark Carney was named as King's successor. Banks bailout King had faced accusations of refusing funding to the Northern Rock Bank, precipitating a run on that bank, a situation not seen in the UK since 1914.. King later said that it had been the chancellor, Alistair Darling, not he, who had the final word on refusing the necessary help to Northern Rock. In his review of King's tenure as governor, Times journalist David Wighton wrote: In his memoirs, Alistair Darling was critical of King for emphasising moral hazard‚Äîthe doctrine of not saving the banks from the consequences of their own mistakes‚Äîinstead of rescuing the banks by pumping money into them as the banking-system meltdown occurred in autumn 2008. Despite his refusal to give funding to the retail banks, he retained his job, and submitted in defence to a Treasury Select Committee (New York Times/Financial Times, 20 September 2007) that his actions were on the basis that the Bank of England was the \\"lender of last resort\\" but subsequently supported moves to provide funding to those banks which had been nationalised or partly nationalised. =Political interventions= It has been alleged that King's Mansion House speech for 2009 helped to bolster the Conservatives during the approach to the general election by issuing high-profile criticisms. King called for the break-up of the country's biggest banks, as well as arguing that, unless the bank was given more active, interventionist powers to ensure financial stability, it would be like a church: able to \\"do no more than issue sermons or organise burials.\\" King later advised a rebalancing of the economy, increased saving, and an \\"elimination of the structural deficit\\". In November 2009, he told MPs that the then Labour government's intention of halving the deficit over the next five years was insufficient. In May 2010, just days after the Coalition government was formed, King said he had spoken to Chancellor George Osborne and supported his plans to cut spending by a further ¬£6 billion within the 2010‚Äì11 fiscal year. The Liberal Democrats did not need to be talked around to agreeing to the severity of the cuts. In November 2010, it was revealed that some senior staff at the Bank of England (one of them was David Blanchflower) were uncomfortable with King's endorsement of the government's public spending cuts, accusing him of overstepping the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy. King's support for the government's cuts was in spite of concerns within the bank that cutting spending so rapidly could derail the UK's nascent economic- recovery. These revelations led to accusations of King being a \\"coalition courtier\\" and of making \\"excessively political\\" interventions with regard to UK economic policy. The accusations were given greater weight after the December 2010 WikiLeaks Cablegate. As a result of the WikiLeaks disclosures and David Laws' account of the Tory-Lib-Dem coalition-talks, King was asked by the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee to explain why he was seemingly cited in the talks as backing Tory plans to introduce spending cuts this year. King insisted to the committee that \\"at no stage did I offer any advice on the composition of any measures designed to reduce the government deficit\\"; the committee implicitly accepted King's explanation of events as he is not even mentioned, let alone criticised, in their final report. According to George Osborne, Gus O'Donnell made an offer to have King brief the Tories and Lib Dems during the Coalition's formative talks; however, the parties suspected they \\"knew what he was going to say and . . . also thought it was more appropriate for our Treasury spokesmen to talk to him\\". See Q20 and Q21 plus answers. King was criticised again in May 2012 on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, on the day before an election, after he expressed approval of Coalition austerity measures. In a speech to the European Parliament in Brussels in May 2011, King commented that the Bank of England was more concerned with the broader stability of the economy and banking sector than with inflation figures: \\"The economic consequences of high-level indebtedness now would become more severe if rates were to rise. It is the main reason why interest rates are so low.\\" With regard to Project Merlin, King was critical of Chancellor Osborne's misleading figures, and correctly predicted in a \\"light plausibility check\\" that Merlin would be a failure. In March 2009, King said any plan for a second fiscal stimulus by the UK Government had to be done with caution.BEO Governor: \\"No More Stimulus\\", optionarmageddon.ml- implode.com; accessed 30 March 2015. In his Mansion House speech in June 2009, King criticised Chancellor Alistair Darling for resisting significant changes to the allocation of regulatory responsibilities between the FSA, the Treasury and the bank, which would have given the bank greater power to fulfil its role of ensuring economic stability.For King's previous position see In January 2012, King received a letter from the government's former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, Zac Goldsmith, former environment minister John Gummer (and 17 others) warning of the possibility of a carbon bubble. King agreed to an evaluation of the matter. The BoE's Financial Policy Committee, established to identify emerging bubbles in the financial system, agreed in March 2012 to ask Parliament for new policy tools to be used to prevent another financial crisis. King said that the FPC narrowed its choice of instruments to three‚Äîthe power to ensure banks have countercyclical capital buffers, the ability to force banks to hold more capital against exposure to specific sectors judged risky, and the power to set leverage ratios‚Äîbecause it will be important to explain to parliament and the wider public why it is or is not using them. Late March 2019, he argued that the UK should leave without a deal in the wake of the UK's decision to leave the European Union, arguing that the economic consequences would be limited, and that the UK was well-prepared after six months of preparations. Personal life King's wife, Barbara Melander, is a Finnish interior designer and comes from the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. They married in a private ceremony in a church in Helsinki in 2007. King is a fan of Aston Villa F.C.. He once arranged a game between Bank of England employees and ex-Villa players.

Random House Unabridged Dictionary. ; sometimes voluntarismNot to be confused with political voluntarism as the political facet of philosophical voluntarism, holding that political authority emanates from a will. )\\"Voluntarism\\". Random House Unabridged Dictionary. is used to describe the philosophy of Auberon Herbert, and later that of the authors and supporters of The Voluntaryist magazine, which, similarly to anarcho- capitalism, rejects the state and supports private property. As a term, voluntaryism was coined in this usage by Auberon Herbert in the 19th century and gained renewed use since the late 20th century, especially within libertarianism in the United States. Voluntaryist principal beliefs stem from the principles of self-ownership and non-aggression.  History  = Movements identifying as voluntaryist =  17th century  Precursors to the voluntaryist movement had a long tradition in the English-speaking world, at least as far back as the Leveller movement of mid-seventeenth century England. The Leveller spokesmen John Lilburne and Richard Overton who \\"clashed with the Presbyterian puritans, who wanted to preserve a state-church with coercive powers and to deny liberty of worship to the puritan sects\\". The Levellers were nonconformist in religion and advocated for the separation of church and state. The church to their way of thinking was a voluntary associating of equals, and furnished a theoretical and practical model for the civil state. If it was proper for their church congregations to be based on consent, then it was proper to apply the same principle of consent to its secular counterpart. For example, the Leveller 'large' Petition of 1647 contained a proposal \\"that tythes and all other inforced maintenances, may be for ever abolished, and nothing in place thereof imposed, but that all Ministers may be payd only by those who voluntarily choose them, and contract with them for their labours.\\" The Levellers also held to the idea of self- proprietorship.  19th century  In 1843, Parliament considered legislation that would require part-time compulsory attendance at school of those children working in factories. The effective control over these schools was to be placed in the hands of the established Church of England, and the schools were to be supported largely from funds raised out of local taxation. Nonconformists, mostly Baptists and Congregationalists, became alarmed. They had been under the ban of the law for more than a century. At one time or another they could not be married in their own churches, were compelled to pay church rates against their will, and had to teach their children underground for fear of arrest. They became known as voluntaryists because they consistently rejected all state aid and interference in education, just as they rejected the state in the religious sphere of their lives. Some of the most notable voluntaryists included the young Herbert Spencer, who published his first series of articles \\"The Proper Sphere of Government,\\" beginning in 1842; his supporter Auberon Herbert, who coined the modern usage of voluntaryist and established its current definition; Edward Baines, editor and proprietor of the Leeds Mercury; and Edward Miall, Congregationalist minister and founder-editor of The Nonconformist, who wrote Views of the Voluntary Principle. The educational voluntaryists wanted free trade in education, just as they supported free trade in corn or cotton. Their concern for \\"liberty can scarcely be exaggerated\\". They believed that \\"government would employ education for its own ends\\" (teaching habits of obedience and indoctrination), and that government-controlled schools would ultimately teach children to rely on the State for all things. Baines, for example, noted that \\"[w]e cannot violate the principles of liberty in regard to education without furnishing at once a precedent and inducement to violate them in regard to other matters\\". Baines conceded that the then current system of education (both private and charitable) had deficiencies, but he argued that freedom should not be abridged on that account. In asking whether freedom of the press should be compromised because we have bad newspapers, Baines replied that \\"I maintain that Liberty is the chief cause of excellence; but it would cease to be Liberty if you proscribed everything inferior\\". The Congregational Board of Education and the Baptist Voluntary Education Society are usually given pride of place among the Voluntaryists. In southern Africa, voluntaryism in religious matters was an important part of the liberal \\"Responsible Government\\" movement of the mid-19th century, along with support for multi- racial democracy and an opposition to British imperial control. The movement was driven by powerful local leaders such as Saul Solomon and John Molteno. When it briefly gained power, it disestablished the state-supported churches in 1875.Molteno, P. A.

C: Saul Solomon ‚Äì the Member for Cape Town. Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 1948.  In the United States  Although there was never an explicitly voluntaryist movement in the United States until the late 20th century, earlier Americans did agitate for the disestablishment of government-supported churches in several of the original thirteen states. These conscientious objectors believed mere birth in a given geographic area did not mean that one consented to membership or automatically wished to support a state church. Their objection to taxation in support of the church was two-fold: taxation not only gave the state some right of control over the church; it also represented a way of coercing the non-member or the unbeliever into supporting the church. In New England, where both Massachusetts and Connecticut started out with state churches, many people believed that they needed to pay a tax for the general support of religion. For the same reasons, they paid taxes to maintain the roads and the courts. There were at least two well-known Americans who espoused voluntaryist causes during the mid-19th century. Henry David Thoreau's first brush with the law in his home state of Massachusetts came in 1838, when he turned twenty-one. The state demanded that he pay the one dollar ministerial tax in support of a clergyman, \\"whose preaching my father attended but never I myself\\". When Thoreau refused to pay the tax, it was probably paid by one of his aunts. In order to avoid the ministerial tax in the future, Thoreau had to sign an affidavit attesting he was not a member of the church. Thoreau's overnight imprisonment for his failure to pay another municipal tax, the poll tax, to the town of Concord was recorded in his essay \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\", first published in 1849. It is often referred to as \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience\\" because in he concluded that government was dependent on the cooperation of its citizens. While he was not a thoroughly consistent voluntaryist, he did write that he wished never to \\"rely on the protection of the state\\" and that he refused to tender it his allegiance so long as it supported slavery. He distinguished himself from \\"those who call[ed] themselves no-government men\\", writing that \\"I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government\\". This has been interpreted as a gradualist, rather than minarchist, stance, given that he also opened his essay by stating his belief that \\"government is best which governs not at all\\", a point that all voluntaryists heartily embrace. One of those \\"no-government men\\" was William Lloyd Garrison, famous abolitionist and publisher of The Liberator. Nearly all abolitionists identified with the self- ownership principle, namely that each person, as an individual, owned and should control his or her own mind and body free of outside coercive interference. The abolitionist called for the immediate and unconditional cessation of slavery because they saw slavery as man-stealing in its most direct and worst form. Slavery reflected the theft of a person's self- ownership rights. The slave was a chattel with no rights of its own. The abolitionists realized that each human being, without exception, was naturally invested with sovereignty over him or her self and that no one could exercise forcible control over another without breaching the self-ownership principle. Garrison was not a pure voluntaryist, for he supported the federal government's war against the Southern states from 1861 to 1865. Another one was Charles Lane. He was friendly with Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau. Between January and June 1843, a series of nine letters he penned were published in such abolitionist's papers as The Liberator and The Herald of Freedom. The title under which they were published was \\"A Voluntary Political Government\\" in which Lane described the state in terms of institutionalized violence and referred to its \\"club law, its mere brigand right of a strong arm, [supported] by guns and bayonets\\". He saw the coercive state on par with \\"forced\\" Christianity, arguing: \\"Everyone can see that the church is wrong when it comes to men with the [B]ible in one hand, and the sword in the other. Is it not equally diabolical for the state to do so?\\" Lane believed that governmental rule was only tolerated by public opinion because the fact was not yet recognized that all the true purposes of the state could be carried out on the voluntary principle, just as churches could be sustained voluntarily. Reliance on the voluntary principle could only come about through \\"kind, orderly, and moral means\\" that were consistent with the totally voluntary society he was advocating, adding: \\"Let us have a voluntary State as well as a voluntary Church, and we may possibly then have some claim to the appeallation of free men\\". From the French world, there was Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat, whose book The Law argued that for a free society, a government must only concern itself with maintaining the individual's right to defend his life, liberty and property; and that if a government pursues anything more than that such as is common with philanthropy, then it will inevitably encroach those rights, rescinding freedom. = Modern-era voluntaryists = Although use of the label voluntaryist waned after the death of Auberon Herbert in 1906, its use was renewed in 1982, when George H. Smith, Wendy McElroy and Carl Watner began publishing The Voluntaryist magazine. Smith suggested use of the term to identify those libertarians who believed that political action and political parties (especially the Libertarian Party) were antithetical to their ideas. In their \\"Statement of Purpose\\" in Neither Bullets nor Ballots: Essays on Voluntaryism (1983), Watner, Smith and McElroy explained that voluntaryists were advocates of non-political strategies to achieve a free society. They rejected electoral politics \\"in theory and practice as incompatible with libertarian goals\\" and argued that political methods invariably strengthen the legitimacy of coercive governments. In concluding their \\"Statement of Purpose\\", they wrote: \\"Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State through education, and we advocate the withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent on which state power ultimately depends\\". In following years, Murray Rothbard advocated voluntaryism in his book For a New Liberty, and voluntaryist philosopher John Zube began writing a series of articles advocating left-wing voluntaryism in the 1980s. The most prolific contributors to the philosophy of voluntaryism in the 21st century include Larken Rose and Carl Watner. Adam Kokesh ran for president of the United States in 2020 on a voluntaryist platform. The Free State Project is a notable movement to convince libertarians to move to New Hampshire to build a truly free state, and has many voluntaryist adherents. The Free State Project's Porcupine Festival and Anarchapulco are two notable voluntaryist events.

She lives in France. Kramberger was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia. She completed undergraduate studies in history at the University of Ljubljana, where she also studied archaeology, abandoning this latter when she became engaged in the literary field (1995). She enrolled postgraduate history studies in 1997 and was from then on till 2010 (when a university purge of critical intellectuals was executed at the University of Primorska) a steady and active member of the university research, editorial and pedagogical circles in Slovenia. She obtained her PhD in 2009 from history/historical anthropology at the University of Primorska with a thesis entitled Memory and Remembrance. Historical Anthropology of the Canonized Reception. She was an initiator and for ten years editor-in-chief of Monitor ISH-Review of Humanities and Social Sciences (2001‚Äì2003), in 2004 renamed to Monitor ZSA-Review for Historical, Social and Other Anthropologies (2004‚Äì2010).Last two numbers of Monitor ZSA are available here and here Between 2004 and 2007 she was a president of the TROPOS-Association for Historical, Social and Other Anthropologies and for Cultural Activities (Ljubljana, Slovenia). She publishes monographs in the areas of epistemology of social sciences and historiography, history and historical anthropology of various subjects for the period between 18th to mid-20th Centuries. She is also an internationally acclaimed writer, she writes literary books, literary studies and essays. She translates texts from all fields mentioned from English, French, Italian and Spanish to Slovenian language. She earned some scientific and literary fellowships abroad at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales and in Paris, at in Budapest, from in Ottensheim, Austria, from in Canada. She also publishes scientific and literary articles, essays and translations. She participates at international scientific and literary conferences, research projects, and is a member of some professional associations and organizations. She helped in organization of some international conferences, as for example in the case of conference Territorial and Imaginary Frontiers and Identities from Antiquity until Today, accent on Balkans (2002 in Ljubljana) and international scientific conference of the Francophonie (AUF) titled Histoire de l‚Äôoubli/History of Oblivion (2008 in Koper). Her research fields are: epistemology of historiography and social sciences, historical anthropology, contemporary history from Enlightenment to mid-20th century, transmission and politics of memory/oblivion, intellectual history and cultural transfers in Europe, anti-intellectualism, dimensions and representations of the Dreyfus Affair in Slovenian social Space and in Trieste, mechanisms of social exclusion, extermination, genocide and Shoah/Holocaust studies, anthropology of sex and gender, constitution of (national and transnational) literary fields in Europe in 19th and 20th Centuries, studies of province and provincialism as a specific socio- historical phenomenon. Since October 2012 she lives in France together with her husband Drago Braco Rotar, professor of sociology, historical anthropology, translator and a renowned public intellectual in Slovenia and Yugoslavia - who during the 1980s and early 1900s established many key institutions in Slovenia and led them for years (to name only three most important: the now classical green translation edition Studia humanitatis, the first private postgraduate school ISH-Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis, Faculty of Graduate Studies in Human Sciences, where he designed and launched the program of historical anthropology).  Biography  Born in Ljubljana, she spent her childhood (between age 4 and 11) at the seaside ‚Äì in the bilingual old-Venetian town of Koper-Capodistria near Trieste. She has finished there 4 years of primary school (Pinko Toma≈æiƒç), and then moved with a family to Ljubljana. There she has finished primary and secondary school Gimnazija Be≈æigrad. She obtained BA from history at the University of Ljubljana (1997), and took the position of a postgraduate young researcher at the Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis (abr. ISH) in Ljubljana. There she founded an anthropological journal Monitor ISH which was later (in 2004) later appropriated by the others at the ISH, though the journal and its founding editorial board continued to publish the journal under the name Monitor ZSA (outside the institution). After the transition changes, when lucrative and socially applicable science was placed in the first plan at the ISH, she has - among dozen others - left the institution (2004), and moved with Drago B. Rotar to Koper-Capodistria, where a new University of Primorska has started its route. There Taja Kramberger together with Drago B. Rotar, established the whole program of historical anthropology (from undergraduate to postgraduate level) which found its nest at the Department of Anthropology. The program was accredited by the State and worked really well, as both teachers were liked by the students, and their classrooms always full, till the university purge in 2010. Beside in literature and historical anthropology she was/is engaged in civil actions and confrontations against clientelism and corruption in the scientific domain in the frames of Slovenia. In May 2000 she co-directed together with Sabina Mihelj a big public manifestation with cultural program in Ljubljana against corrupted politics of the Ministry of Science and Technology. In 2004 she fought against illegal takeover of the institution ISH and insisted to publish all crucial documents, personal testimonies of the takeover as well as reflections of the events from the perspective of the people who finally left the ISH from indignation with their ex- colleagues.Publication was realized as a special red number of the journal Monitor ZSA, vol. VII, no. 1-4, 2005. A review of the red number was of the published in the weekly Mladina In 2010 she, again, was an active militant against the total neoliberalization, venalization and degradation of the university as an autonomous institution and against the decomoposition of its fundamental scientific disciplines at the Faculty of Human Sciences Koper, University of Primorska.See footnote 1. The same regressive social changes occurred simultaneously also in the literary field in Slovenia. In 2004 when a writer and translator Iztok Osojnik as a director of the Vilenica International Literary Festival was ousted from the position of Vilenica's director at the Slovene Writers' Association(abr. SWA). She was among the tiny minority who supported him against mostly State implemented and maintained elite and all-regime supported writers and authors, meanwhile majority of writers remained quiet ‚Äì also around two then ardently debated subjects of growing nationalism and humiliation of women writers and translators in the frames of the SWA.Polemics around the new economically and politically accommodated leadership of the SWA, which lasted the whole summer and autumn of 2004, was published in the review Apokalipsa, no. 84/85, 2004. After that Taja Kramberger distanced herself from the SWA's network. She writes and translates literature by her own vocation and ethical standards. Since she lives in France (from 2012) she also stepped out of the SWA with an open letter in December 2014 (denied by all Slovene mass-media and suppressed by the president of the SWA) represents only herself and her apatrid chair in Paris. As she writes in one of her poems: Nothing remains./ But life is still here,/ and it speaks the guerrilla alphabet. (...) I am without home,/ I belong to / the invisible community of the banished./ Remove the ethnic adjective / from my name.Taja Kramberger, Z roba klifa (From the Edge of a Cliff), 2011, CSK, Ljubljana, 'Pesmi odhoda/Poems of Departure', III, tr. by ≈†pela Drnov≈°ek Zorko.  History, historical anthropology  = Conceptualization of the collective memory and its distinctions from remembrance and history = Taja Kramberger introduced studies of collective memory, based on Halbwachsian instrumentarium and numerous later improvements of this conceptualization into Slovenian university sphere, mostly composed of linear descriptive social sciences and humanities and hostile towards any changes. In 2000/2001 she held a course of Conceptualization of the collective memory about conceptual differences of Maurice Halbwachs, Frances Amelia Yates, Pierre Nora and Aleida Assmann at the Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis in Ljubljana. In 2000-2001 she wrote an extensive introduction to the Maurice Halbwachs' Slovenian translation of La m√©moire collective. Not many scholars in Slovenia followed - for any critical thinking - highly important distinction between memory (m√©moire) and remembrance (souvenir), as the editorial board of the Slovene Halbwachs' translation unilaterally and against all protests of the translator (Rotar) and of the introductory writer (Kramberger) decided to translate all words of m√©moire and souvenir into just one notion of spomin, that is of remembrance (souvenir in French). With this the theoretical aspect of the Halbwachs' differentiated concept (that is one of his most important life intellectual achievements) was ruined for the Slovene readers. Still some rare researchers seem to understand the distinction (among them Marija Juriƒç Pahor and Samuel Fri≈°kiƒç), so they were able to grasp the further categorical substantial differences between the notions of memory and history. However, Kramberger's works expose her incontestably broad knowledge, highly pertinent argumentation and subtle discursive skills, which are not easy to contest. = Critical Reflexivity of the Slovenian Historiography = Kramberger has also started with the extensive categorical critical reflexivity in the field of history in Slovenia, and has released many angry reactions in the history field, but mostly she left the historians - unable to confront its own shadows from the past - silenced. Although polemic, which would definitely clarify the discipline's past erratic wanderings and amnesias and an almost total theoretic oblivion in the field of history in Slovenia, is not a usual tool of scientific communication in these regions, it is nevertheless clear that Taja Kramberger has opened (among some other researchers, such as Drago Braco Rotar, Rastko Moƒçnik, Maja Breznik, Lev Centrih, Primo≈æ Kra≈°ovec, in a small, theoretically much less pertinent part also Marta Verginella and Oto Luthar) an important segment of future debates, which are needed to elucidate some of the neglected and spontaneously transmitted chapters of the Slovenian (distinctly ethnocentric and Sonderweg) history. = Representations and aspects of the Dreyfus Affair in the Slovenophone World = Taja Kramberger was also the first Slovenian historian who had written about various dimensions and echoes of the Dreyfus Affair in the Slovenian social space during the affair and later. She has opened up a complex theme of anti- Semitism strangely neglected and only partially elucidated in the Slovene history. She connected this exclusive phenomenon to the categories and imaginary and specific discursive practices. Introducing a research seminar at the undergraduate level she exposed how the anti-Semitic discursive formations can mobilize people and public opinion in the country with not many Jewish people. She demonstrated how even in social spaces with a scarce population of Jews strong mechanisms of social exclusion nonetheless operate smoothly - often even more aggressively and viscerally than in bigger countries. In the frames of this theme she directed ‚Äì together with her students in 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 ‚Äì an ample exhibition on the Dreyfus Affair (1894‚Äì1906), showing its entangled and differentiated European context(s), its highly important civic extensions, and its specific reception in the continental Centro- European spaces of Slovenia and Trieste. The latter two mostly based on spontaneous, normalized and career promising anti-Semitism, though not at all innoxious. The exhibitions was set up and shown to the public in Koper (2008), Trieste (2009), Maribor (2010) and Murska Sobota (2011). Besides implementing many fresh intellectual ideas, pedagogical and theoretical innovations (rather bothersome for the Slovenian socio-political and 'intellectual' common sense) Taja Kramberger has written numerous critical articles on various aspects of Slovenian history, cultural life, but also on broader European History and culture, e. g. on Spanish Civil War, different models of Enlightenment in Europe and the recurrent Enlightenment features in the works of Anton Toma≈æ Linhart, on epistemic divergence between Enlightenment's and Historismus's paradigms of historiography, on anthropology of translation, history of university and the formation of university habitus Habitus, on literary and cultural fields Pierre Bourdieu (Th√©orie des champs√† in the 1930s in Slovenia (by then partially covered by the administrative unit of Dravska banovina) and on the role of women in the constitution of these fields etc. For years lecturing a course on social and anthropological aspects of women history and gender constructions, she translated into Slovenian Michelle Perrot's classical work Women or the Silences of History.Original Les femmes ou les silences de l'histoire, Paris: Flammarion, 1998. In Slovene translation ≈Ωenske ali molƒçanja zgodovine, KUD Police Dubove, 2016. = Bourdieuian Studies in the frames of Slovenia = Her intellectual trajectory is partly connected to the Bourdieuian perspective and apparatus in social sciences. She has written about Pierre Bourdieu and Lo√Øc Wacquant, translated some of their texts (as a guest editor of the journal Dru≈æboslovne razprave, no. 43, 2003), and in 2006 edited a monograph titled Principles of Reflexive Social Science and for a Critical Investigation of Symbolic Dominations (Naƒçela za refleksivno dru≈æbeno znanost in kritiƒçno preuƒçevanje simbolnih dominacij) (in Slovenian, together with Drago Braco Rotar). She held lectures ‚Äì among other subjects ‚Äì on Bourdieuian approach, instrumentarium and methodology at the University of Primorska in Koper.  Literature  = Poetry = She has published eight books of poetry. Her poems have been translated in more than twenty-five languages and published in different literary journals, anthologies in Slovenia and abroad. Book selections of her poetry came out in Hungarian (Ezernyi csend : v√°logatott versek, Pann√≥nia k√∂nyvek, P√©cs, Pro Pannonia Kiad√≥i Alap√≠tv√°ny, 2008, ) and Croatian language (Mobilizacije, Naklada Lara, Zagreb, 2008, tr. Ksenija Premur, ).http://www.naklada-lara.com/naklada.html She has been an invited guest of around 100 international literary meetings and festivals in Europe (Belgium, England, Lithuania, Portugal, Croatia, Latvia, France, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Macedonia, France, Lithuania, Finland, Ireland etc.) and Canada (Quebec and Ontario). Taja Kramberger, as the committee of Veronika Award (2007) for the best poetry collection of the year 2006 wrote, is one of the strongest and most accomplished poetic voices in the contemporary Slovenian poetry; a voice which introduces many innovations \\"so in the poetic proceedings as in the audacity of the chosen subjects, but also in the courage to tell things in an intelligent and a deeply moving way, which does not follow the predominant poetry models, but supplies itself outside of them, in a everyday situations ...\\". Simple words, entangled with highly elaborated intellectual comprehensions - another benefit of Kramberger's poetic language, in Taja Kramberger's poems change themselves into \\"multilayered compositions\\" and subtle messages. These are \\"able to reach out to the world, and are surely not here for the intimacy of the poet\\" and neither for sentimental grounds of the reader. And still this poetry is deeply moving, at the same moment emotionally charged and brightly intelligible, light-coloured in spite of breathtaking \\"gestuary of crime\\" denuded by the Kramberger's verses, as Osojnik observed in her later poetry book in which the poet is narrating the Dreyfuss Affair through the cycle of poems (Opus quinque dierum, 2009). These features, together with poet's precious \\"poetically analytical mind\\", which is able to convert a \\"stale literary canon and criticism into an inspiration for the highest level of poetry\\", so says the \\"Veronika Award\\" committee, are innovations, which \\"give her poetry a seal of world importance and actuality\\" (Explanation for the Veronika Award 2007). Jad Hatem, a French poet himself and a professor of philosophy and literature Jad Hatem, in an original way also noticed that a privileged topos in Taja Krambeger's poetry is her outstanding ability of a simultaneous theoretic reflection, inscribed along with the poetic thought of her poems (La Po√©sie slov√®ne contemporaine : l‚Äô√©criture de la pierre, 2010). From a very different angle Slovenian poet Iztok Osojnik sees this rare privilege, that is the poet's critical ability to transform ideologically contaminated and narrow representations of reality in a poetic way into more bearable representations of reality, which bring us much closer to the core of events, as a tool of the political poetryhttp://www.pemmicanpress.com/articles/daggett-political-poetry.html in its best and noble sense (Apokalipsa, no. 134/135). = Translations, organizations of cultural events = Next to numerous translated poems and some prose texts of other writers published in journals, she translated into Slovene language a book of poetry of Italian poet Michele Obit (Leta na oknu, ZTT EST, Trieste, 2001, ), a selection of poetry of Argentinian poet Roberto Juarroz for a book Vertikalna poezija (Vertical Poetry - with her introduction, ≈†Z, Ljubljana, 2006, ), a book of Gao Xingjian (Ribi≈°ka palica za starega oƒçeta/Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather, 1986‚Äì1990, from French together with Drago Braco Rotar) (Didakta, Radovljica, 2001, ), a book of poetry written by Lithuanian poet Neringa Abrutyte (Izpoved, CSK, Aleph, Ljubljana, 2004, ) and a book of fairy tales for kids by Lucy Coats (100 gr≈°kih mitov za otroke/Atticus the Storyteller, 2004; MK, Ljubljana, 2004, reprinted in 2009, ). At the ISH ‚Äì Graduate School of Humanities in Ljubljana, Taja Kramberger arranged exhibition place for fine arts and between 2000 and 2003 organized five exhibitions of Slovenian and of foreign figurative artists (painters, photographic artists, designers, installation artists). In 2002, Taja Kramberger directed and coordinated international project of poets‚Äô and translators‚Äô (22 from 10 countries) \\"Linguaggi di-versi / Different Languages / Razliƒçni jeziki / Langages di-vers\\" in a seaside town of Ankaran near Koper in Slovenia. Project established a series of translation workshops between 1999 and 2004 in Central-European States (Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy and Austria). In 2004 the publication Razliƒçni jeziki / Linguaggi di-versi / Different Languages / Langages di-vers in 10 languages came out of the project (published by the Edition Libris Koper) and it was edited by T. Kramberger and Ga≈°per Malej. Anne Talvaz, a French writer and translator, and Bulgarian translator Stefka Hrusanova have broadened the scope of the workshop and organized in 2008 and 2010 its presentations in Spain (Barcelona) and Italy (Milan). Another bigger international project Taja Kramberger conducted in 2006 was a Slovenian segment of the international project \\"Sealines / Morske linije / Linee di mare\\" which through one-month's literary residences in 6 European bilingual ports (Cardiff, Galway, Helsinki, Koper, Riga, Valletta) connected writers from 6 European states. Project was supported by the program Culture 2000 of the European Union, and was led by the LAF ‚Äì Literature Across Frontiers office in UK, Manchester. In Slovenia it was executed by the Association Tropos and its then president Taja Kramberger. From 2007 to 2009, Kramberger was a president of the Collegium artium (abr. CA) ‚Äì an association of teachers and students at the Faculty of Human Sciences Koper, University of Primorska, aimed at organizing different cultural and social events at the faculty (literary readings, music concerts, theater and film performances, round tables, conferences, commemorations, exhibitions of figurative arts, other specialized exhibitions etc.). In the frames of the institution CA more than 150 cultural events took place in less than two years. = Essays, studies and criticism = Her essays and introductory studies to the other poets (Roberto Juarroz, Michele Obit, Ga≈°per Malej) mark quite different approach from other Slovenian literary critics. They are attentive analyses of poetic language and imaginary constellation behind it. With the essay titled Similis simili gaudet. Ali o kerkopski literarni kritiki v slovenskem literarnem polju (Similis simili gaudet. On the Kercopian Literary Criticism in the Slovenian Literary Field),http://bracorotar.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kerkopska-kritika.pdf written with a rare combination of fine irony and piercing analytical style, on drastically unrefexive criticism in Slovenian literature she has shown how important it is for a critic to be disposable and open to the artistic work and at the same time able to produce analytical distances in relation to the work read and evaluated, and in the next step to compound both experiences into a certain perspective, which can come out as his/her own distinctive approach and a singular way of seeing things and works of art. Without that (minimal) cognitive engagement, so Taja Kramberger, there can be no artistic criticism, but only an unconscious and ritualized activity - she calls it a Kercopian literary criticism - that is a (grinning) mimesis of common sense and stereotypes about literature and authors. In her interviews she talks about cognitive dimensions of literature and their transformational potential in a society. Transformational discourses and discursive practices, which are open to changes and interventions, as the opposite of the transfirmational discourses with closed semantic structure and clear signs of mental immobility are original analytical categories of her conceptualization and apparatus. In scholary texts (cf. her article Doxa et fama, 2003, her dissertation, or her interview for the journal Literatura in 2006) Taja Kramberger further identifies transfirmational discourses as the systemic feature of the longue dur√©e provincial mental structure, unable to subdue itself to changes and open to the external/outer world. Taja Kramberger is without any doubt among those few Slovenian writers (Iztok Osojnik, Miklav≈æ Komelj, in a way also Barbara Korun) which are studiously oriented, and do not recognize (pure) inspiration as a sufficient cause for creative artistic work. In their artistic work there's a strong component of social sensitivity and a constant ethical reference to attain the equilibrium of social justice.

Hart initially worked as an officer in a Gurkha regiment until the start of Indian independence, whereupon he became involved in children's television from the 1950s, working on Blue Peter for a few years before fronting a series of children's art programmes, including Take Hart and Hartbeat. His contributions to children's television include the design of the ship logo used by Blue Peter and the show's badges, and the animated character of Morph, who appeared beside him on his programmes following his introduction in the 1970s. Early life Hart was interested in drawing from an early age. He attended All Saints, Margaret Street Resident Choir School and then Clayesmore School in Dorset, where art was his best subject. Military service Hart left school in 1943 and wanted to join the Royal Air Force, but as he would have been unable to fly owing to slightly deficient eyesight, he followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps and joined the British Indian Army instead where he gained an officers' commission in the 1st Gurkha Rifles. However, when he was told that lower-ranked British officers would be replaced by Indian officers following Indian independence, he decided to return to civilian life. The outbreak of the Korean War (25 June 1950) saw him being re- commissioned in the Territorial Army, attached to the Royal Artillery, from 23 November 1948 to 1 July 1950. Career After being demobilised, Hart decided to become a professional artist and studied art at Maidstone College of Art, which later became Kent Institute of Art & Design (and is now the Maidstone campus of the University for the Creative Arts). He graduated in 1950 and, after working as a display artist in a London store, became a freelance artist. Hart's break into broadcast television work came in 1952, after his brother persuaded him to attend a party where he met a BBC children's TV producer. After an interview, in which Hart drew a fish on a napkin while the producer was looking for paper, Hart became resident artist on the Saturday Special programme. Subsequent TV shows included Playbox (1954‚Äì59), Tich and Quackers, Vision On (1964‚Äì76) Take Hart (1977‚Äì83), Hartbeat (1984‚Äì93), Artbox Bunch (1995‚Äì96) and Smart Hart (1999‚Äì2000). From the 1970s, he often appeared alongside the animated Plasticine stop-motion character Morph, created by Peter Lord of Aardman Animations. Hart was a regular face on the BBC children's programme Blue Peter in the 1950s and presented a number of programmes in 1959. Richard Marson's book Blue Peter: Inside the Archives lists Hart as a presenter in November 1959 but he is not officially listed as a host. As well as demonstrating small-scale projects (the type that viewers might be able to do), Hart also created large-scale artworks on the TV studio floor, and even used beaches and other open spaces as 'canvases'. A regular feature of Hart's TV shows was The Gallery, which displayed artworks (paintings, drawings and collages) sent in by young viewers. One of the pieces of easy-listening vibraphone music accompanying this feature‚Äî\\"Left Bank Two\\", composed by Wayne Hill and performed by The Noveltones‚Äîhas passed into British TV theme lore. This was first introduced in the show Vision On. Hart also created the original design for the Blue Peter badge, also used as the programme's logo. He originally asked for his fee to be paid as a royalty of 1d (one pre- decimalisation penny) for each badge made, but was offered a flat fee of ¬£100 (equivalent to around ¬£1,600 at 2006 rates). The badges are famous throughout the UK and have been coveted by successive generations of Blue Peter viewers. Hart received two BAFTA awards. His first, for Best Children's Educational Programme, came in 1984 for Take Hart, and he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. He retired from regular TV work in 2001. Personal life Hart met his wife, Jean Skingle, while working in television; they married in 1953. They were married for 50 years until she died in 2003. They had a daughter, Carolyn, and two grandchildren. Death On 28 December 2006, it was announced during the reunion programme It Started with Swap Shop that Hart was in poor health, though this was not elaborated upon until an interview with The Times published on 30 September 2008, revealing that two strokes had robbed him of the use of his hands and left him unable to draw. He described this as \\"the greatest cross I have to bear\\". Hart died peacefully on 18 January 2009 at the age of 83. Hart's funeral took place in the village of Shamley Green, where he had lived for more than 40 years. =Tributes= On 1 March 2009 a flash mob, organised through Facebook, paid tribute to Hart with around two hundred Morph figures displayed outside the Tate Modern art gallery. Hart's daughter, Carolyn Ross, attended and judged the \\"Best Morph in Show\\". A memorial plaque is displayed in Hart's birthplace, the town of Maidstone, where he studied art at the town's art college. The plaque was unveiled by his daughter in May 2009 at the Hazlitt Arts Centre. In September 2010 Tony Hart: A Portrait of My Dad, an affectionate biography of Hart by his daughter Carolyn, was published by John Blake Publishing. In February 2015 a wave of tributes (followed by corrections) appeared on social media sites over a period of two days, when an individual mistakenly read a 2009 report of Hart's death and, missing the dateline, published it as news on Facebook, from which it was later transferred to Twitter. Many social media posters hyperlinked to an article in The Guardian. The newspaper published a graph of the number of readers referred to its article for the period. Aardman Animations used its Twitter account, in the name of Morph, to point to a tribute to Tony Hart (a portrait of him being hung on a wall) that was included in the last episode of its forthcoming new set of episodes for the Morph television series.

Joseph Kessel (10 February 1898 ‚Äì 23 July 1979) was a French journalist and novelist. He was a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and Grand officer of the Legion of Honour. Biography Kessel was born in Villa Clara, Entre R√≠os, Argentina, because of the constant journeys of his father, a Litvak physician. From 1905 to 1908, Joseph Kessel lived the first years of his childhood in Orenburg, Russia, before the family moved to France in 1908. He studied in lyc√©e Mass√©na, Nice and lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, Paris and took part in the First World War as an aviator. He was also an aviator during the Second World War, in the Free French (342 Squadron RAF) with RAF Bomber Command, with Romain Gary, who was also a talented French novelist. Kessel wrote several novels and books that were later represented in the cinema, notably Belle de Jour (by Luis Bu√±uel in 1967). In 1943 he and his nephew Maurice Druon translated Anna Marly's song Chant des Partisans into French from its original Russian. The song became one of the anthems of Free French Forces during the Second World War. Kessel was elected at the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1962 and died on 23 July 1979 in Avernes, Val-d'Oise. He is buried in the Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse in Paris. On his deathbed he was quoted as saying that his greatest accomplishment was the birth of his son, Joseph Kessel, who was born just a few months prior on February 24 of the same year.

It it is one of the most visited sights of Germany's capital and one of the most important museum sites in Europe. Built from 1830 to 1930 by order of the Prussian Kings according to plans by five architects, the Museum Island was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. It consists of the Altes Museum, the Neues Museum, the Alte Nationalgalerie, the Bode-Museum and the Pergamonmuseum.Museumsinsel (Museum Island), Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Centre Since the German reunification, the Museum Island has been rebuilt and extended according to a master plan.Masterplan Museumsinsel In 2019, a new visitor center and art gallery, the \\"James-Simon-Galerie,\\" was opened. Overview The Museum Island is so-called for the complex of internationally significant museums, all part of the Berlin State Museums, that occupy the island's northern part: *The Altes Museum (Old Museum) named as the K√∂nigliches Museum when it was built on August 3, 1830, until it was renamed in 1841. The museum was completed on the orders of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. *The Neues Museum (New Museum) finished in 1859 according to plans by Friedrich August St√ºler, a student of Schinkel. Destroyed in World War II, it was rebuilt under the direction of David Chipperfield for the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and re-opened in 2009. *The Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) completed in 1876, also according to designs by Friedrich August St√ºler, to host a collection of 19th-century art donated by banker Joachim H. W. Wagener *The Bode Museum on the island's northern tip, opened in 1904 and then called Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum. It exhibits the sculpture collections and late Antique and Byzantine art. *The Pergamon Museum, constructed in 1930. It contains multiple reconstructed immense and historically significant buildings such as the Pergamon Altar and the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. *The Humboldt Forum is scheduled to open in 2020 in the Berlin Palace opposite the Lustgarten park, and will incorporate the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art; both are successor institutions of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the Berlin Palace and which was established in the mid 16th century. In 1999, the museum complex was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. History A first exhibition hall was erected in 1797 at the suggestion of the archaeologist Aloys Hirt. In 1822, Schinkel designed the plans for the Altes Museum to house the royal Antikensammlung, the arrangement of the collection was overseen by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The island, originally a residential area, was dedicated to \\"art and science\\" by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1841. Further extended under succeeding Prussian kings, the museum's collections of art and archeology were turned into a public foundation after 1918. They are today maintained by the Berlin State Museums branch of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. Museum Island with Pergamon and Bode Museum, 1951 Museum Island further comprises the Lustgarten park and the Berlin Cathedral. Between the Bode and Pergamon Museums it is crossed by the Stadtbahn railway viaduct. The adjacent territory to the south is the site of the former royal and imperial Berlin Palace and the Palace of the Republic. The Prussian collections became separated during the Cold War during the division of the city, but were reunited after German reunification, with the exception of some art and artifacts removed after World War II by Allied troops. These include the Priam's Treasure, also called the gold of Troy, excavated by Heinrich Schliemann in 1873, then smuggled out of Turkey to Berlin and smuggled out of Germany to Moscow. Today it is kept at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. As for the city's major museums, it took much of the 1990s for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island's buildings should be restored and modernized, with General Director Wolf-Dieter Dube's cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999. Then, six months later, Peter- Klaus Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended to turn Museum Island into a Louvre on the Spree.Alan Riding (March 12, 2002), Berlin, Banking on Its Museums; Seeking a New Identity, the City Shakes Up Its Art Legacy New York Times.

The contents of the museums were decided on as follows: The Pergamon, with the Greek altar that gives it its name, retained much of its collection and was defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum presented archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, including the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, displayed Greek and Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode Museum's paintings went from Late Byzantine to 1800. And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century. Once this process is completed, perhaps by 2020, the Gem√§ldegalerie‚Äôs painting collection will be transferred to the Bode, and a new annex, and Museum Island will present all art from the ancient civilizations to 1900.Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), German Museums Move Closer to Reunification New York Times. The James Simon Gallery, a $94 million visitors‚Äô center designed by the British architect David Chipperfield, is being built beside the Neues Museum. It will in turn be linked to the Neues, Altes, Pergamon and Bode Museums by an underground passageway decorated with archaeological objects. Once the Museum Island Master Plan is completed, the so-called Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the five museums in the Museum Island. The Promenade will begin at the Old Museum in the south, lead through the New Museum and the Pergamon Museum and end at the Bode Museum, located at the northern tip of the Island. Before World War II, these museums were connected by bridge passages above ground; they were destroyed due to the effects of the war. There have never been plans to rebuild them; instead, the central courts of individual museums will be lowered, which has already been done in the Bode Museum and in the New Museum. They will be connected by subterranean galleries. In a way, this archaeological promenade can be regarded as the sixth museum in the Island, because it is devised not only as a connecting corridor but also as a strung-out exhibition room for interdisciplinary presentations. The Archaeological Promenade may be characterized as a cross- total of the collections that are shown separately (in accordance with cultural regions, epochs, and art genres) in the individual museums of the Island. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have occupied the human mind irrespective of time and cultural region, be it a question of life after death or issues of beauty and other topics.Hermann Parzinger (December 17, 2015), Museum Island and Humboldt-Forum: A New Centre for Art and Culture in Berlin SCIENCE First Hand.

He produced many religious publications from 1873 to 1912 (in which he is sometimes credited as Adolf Harnack). He was ennobled (with the addition of von to his name) in 1914. Harnack traced the influence of Hellenistic philosophy on early Christian writings and called on Christians to question the authenticity of doctrines that arose in the early Christian church. He rejected the historicity of the Gospel of John in favor of the Synoptic Gospels, criticized the Apostles' Creed, and promoted the Social Gospel. In the 19th century, higher criticism flourished in Germany, establishing the historical-critical method as an academic standard for interpreting the Bible and understanding the historical Jesus . Harnack's work is part of a reaction to T√ºbingen, and represents a reappraisal of tradition. Besides his theological activities, Harnack was a distinguished organizer of sciences. He played an important role in the foundation of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft and became its first president. Biography He was born at Dorpat (today Tartu) in Livonia (then a province of Russia, now in Estonia) where his father, Theodosius Harnack, held a professorship of pastoral theology. He married Amalie Thiersch on 27 December 1879. Their daughter Agnes von Zahn-Harnack became an activist in the Women's movement. Harnack studied at the local Imperial University of Dorpat (1869‚Äì72) and at the University of Leipzig, where he took his degree; soon afterwards, in 1874, he began lecturing as a Privatdozent. These lectures, which dealt with such special subjects as Gnosticism and the Apocalypse, attracted considerable attention, and in 1876 he was appointed professor extraordinarius. In the same year he began the publication, in conjunction with Oscar Leopold von Gebhardt and Theodor Zahn, of an edition of the works of the Apostolic Fathers, Patrum apostolicorum opera, a smaller edition of which appeared in 1877. In 1879 he was called to the University of Giessen as professor ordinarius of church history. There he collaborated with Gebhardt in Texte und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Litteratur (1882 sqq.), an irregular periodical, containing only essays in New Testament and patristic fields. In 1881 he published a work on monasticism, Das M√∂nchtum ‚Äì seine Ideale und seine Geschichte (5th ed., 1900; English translation, 1901), and became joint editor with Emil Sch√ºrer of the Theologische Literaturzeitung. In 1885 he published the first volume of his Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (3rd ed. in three volumes, 1894‚Äì1898; English translation in seven volumes, 1894‚Äì1899). In this work Harnack traced the rise of dogma, which he understood as the authoritative doctrinal system of the church and its development from the 4th century down to the Protestant Reformation. He considered that from its earliest origins, Christian faith and Greek philosophy were so closely intermingled that the resultant system included many beliefs and practices that were not authentically Christian. Therefore, Protestants are not only free, but bound, to criticize it; Protestantism could be understood as a rejection of this dogma and a return to the pure faith that characterized the original church. An abridgment of this appeared in 1889 with the title Grundriss der Dogmengeschichte (3rd ed., 1898). In 1886 Harnack was called to the University of Marburg and in 1888, in spite of violent opposition from the conservative church authorities, to Berlin. In 1890 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences. In Berlin, somewhat against his will, he was drawn into a controversy on the Apostles' Creed, in which the partisan antagonisms within the Prussian Church had found expression. Harnack's view was that the creed contains both too much and too little to be a satisfactory test for candidates for ordination; he preferred a briefer declaration of faith which could be rigorously applied to all (cf. his Das Apostolische Glaubensbekenntnis. Ein geschichtlicher Bericht nebst einer Einleitung und einem Nachwort, 1892). In Berlin, Harnack continued writing. In 1893 he published a history of early Christian literature down to Eusebius of Caesarea, Geschichte der altkirchlichen Literatur bis Eusebius (part 2 of vol. 5., 1897); and in his popular lectures, Das Wesen des Christentums appeared in 1900 (5th ed., 1901; English translation, What is Christianity? 1901). One of his later historical works, Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten (1902; English translation, The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries, in two volumes, 1904‚Äì1905), was followed by some important New Testament studies (Beitrage zur Einleitung in das neue Testament, 1906 sqq.; Engl. trans.: Luke the Physician, 1907; The Sayings of Jesus, 1908). Adolf von Harnack (right) close to Kaiser Wilhelm II on the occasion of the inauguration of a new Kaiser-Wilhelm- Institut (1913). Harnack was one of the most prolific and stimulating of modern critical scholars, and brought up in his \\"Seminar\\" a whole generation of teachers who carried his ideas and methods throughout the whole of Germany and beyond. From 1905 to 1921, Harnack was the General Director of the Royal Library at Berlin (from 1918 called the Prussian State Library). Like many liberal professors in Germany, Harnack welcomed World War I in 1914, and signed a public statement endorsing Germany's war-aims (the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three). It was this statement, with his teacher Harnack's signature on it, that Karl Barth cited as a major impetus for his rejection of liberal theology. Harnack was one of the moving spirits in the foundation, in 1911, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG), and became its first President. The Society's activities were much constrained by the First World War, but in the Weimar Republic period Harnack guided it to be a major vehicle for overcoming the isolation of German academics felt as a result of the war and its aftermath. The society's flagship conference centre in Berlin, the Harnack House, which opened in 1929, was named in his honour. After a long period in U.S. Army hands after World War II it has now resumed the role Harnack envisaged, as a centre for international intellectual life in the German capital, under the management of the KWG's successor organisation, the Max Planck Gesellschaft. Theology Among the distinctive characteristics of Harnack's work were his insistence on absolute freedom in the study of church history and the New Testament (i.e. there were no taboo areas of research that could not be critically examined); his distrust of speculative theology, whether orthodox or liberal; and his interest in practical Christianity as a religious life and not a system of theology. Some of his addresses on social matters were published under the heading \\"Essays on the Social Gospel\\" (1907). Though the four gospels have been regarded as canonical since Irenaeus in the 2nd century,. Harnack‚Äîlike earlier German scholars‚Äîrejected the Gospel of John as without historical value regarding Jesus' life: Harnack denied the possibility of miracles but argued that Jesus may well have performed acts of healing that seemed miraculous: \\"That the earth in its course stood still; that a she-ass spoke; that a storm was quieted by a word, we do not believe, and we shall never again believe; but that the lame walked, the blind saw, and the deaf heard will not be so summarily dismissed as an illusion.\\" Bibliography * Kurt Nowak et al., (eds.), Adolf von Harnack.

It was built from 1910 to 1930 by order of German Emperor William II according to plans by Alfred Messel and Ludwig Hoffmann in Stripped Classicism style.Pergamonmuseum (in German) Landesdenkmalamt Berlin Currently, the Pergamonmuseum is home to the Antikensammlung including the famous Pergamon Altar, the Vorderasiatisches Museum and the Museum f√ºr Islamische Kunst. Parts of the building are closed for renovation until 2023.Pergamonmuseum (in English) Staatliche Museen zu Berlin  Origin  Pergamon Altar By the time the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum on Museum Island (today the Bodemuseum) had opened in 1904, it was clear that the edifice was not large enough to host all of the art and archaeological treasures being excavated under German supervision. Excavations were underway in the areas of ancient Babylon, Uruk, Assur, Miletus, Priene and ancient Egypt, and objects from these sites could not be properly displayed within the existing German museum system. Wilhelm von Bode, director of the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum, initiated plans to build a new museum nearby to accommodate ancient architecture, German post-antiquity art, and Middle Eastern and Islamic art. Alfred Messel began a design for the large three-wing building in 1906. After his death in 1909 his friend Ludwig Hoffman took charge of the project and construction began in 1910, continuing during the First World War (1918) and the great inflation of the 1920s. The completed building was opened In 1930. The Pergamon Museum was severely damaged during the air attacks on Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Many of the display objects had been stored in safe places, and some of the large exhibits were walled in for protection. In 1945, the Red Army collected all of the loose museum items, either as war booty or to rescue them from looting and fires then raging in Berlin. Not until 1958 were most of the objects returned to East Germany. Significant parts of the collection remain in Russia. Some are currently stored in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The return of these items has been arranged in a treaty between Germany and Russia but, as of June 2003, is blocked by Russian restitution laws.  Exhibition  Ishtar Gate Aleppo Room Among the pieces the museum displays are: * The Pergamon Altar * Market Gate of Miletus * The Ishtar Gate and the Processional Way, Babylon * The Mshatta Facade * The Meissner fragment from the Epic of Gilgamesh. =Antiquity Collection (Antikensammlung)= Museum Island with Pergamon Museum and Bode Museum (1951). The collection goes back to the prince-electors, or Kurf√ºrsten, of Brandenburg, who collected objects from antiquity; the collection began with an acquisition to the collection by a Roman archaeologist in 1698. It first became accessible (in part) to the public in 1830, when the Altes Museum was opened. The collection expanded greatly with the excavations in Olympia, Samos, Pergamon, Miletus, Priene, Magnesia, Cyprus and Didyma. This collection is divided between the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum. The collection contains sculpture from the archaic to Hellenistic ages as well as artwork from Greek and Roman antiquity: architecture, sculptures, inscriptions, mosaics, bronzes, jewelry and pottery. The main exhibits are the Pergamon Altar from the 2nd century BC, with a 113 meters (371 ft) long sculptural frieze depicting the struggle of the gods and the giants, and the Gate of Miletus from Roman antiquity. As Germany was divided following the Second World War, so was the collection. The Pergamon Museum was reopened in 1959 in East Berlin, while what remained in West Berlin was displayed in Schloss Charlottenburg. =Islamic Art Museum (Museum f√ºr Islamische Kunst)= When the Bode Museum was opened in 1904, a section for Islamic art was created and later included in the Pergamon Museum (1950). Besides Islamic artwork from the 8th to the 19th century ranging from Spain to India, the main attraction is the Mshatta facade, which originates from an unfinished early Islamic desert palace located south of Amman in present-day Jordan. It was a gift from the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. Parts of the eastern portion of the facade and the ruins of the structure of which it formed a part remain in Jordan. Another unique exhibition is the Aleppo room. This area of the museum features a reception room from a broker's home in Aleppo, Syria, that was commissioned during the Ottoman Period.Annette Hagedorn \\"Aleppo Room\\" in Discover Islamicart Art. Place: Museum With No Frontiers, 2010. The Islamic Art Museum also regularly hosts temporary exhibitions of modern art from the Islamic world, such as the 2008 Turkish Delight (contemporary Turkish design) and Naqsh (Gender in Iranian Art and Society). In 2008 part of the Keir Collection of Edmund de Unger, formerly housed in his home in Ham, Surrey, was placed on long-term loan to the Museum for an initial period of 15 years. One of the most important post-war private collections of Islamic art, it covers the entire Islamic world from medieval times to the eighteenth century and includes carpets, textiles, illuminated manuscripts, bookbindings, ceramics, metalware and rock crystal objects. =The Middle East Museum (Vorderasiatisches Museum)= Victory stele of Esarhaddon The Middle East Museum exhibition displays objects found by German archeologists and others from the areas of Assyrian, Sumerian and Babylonian culture. Additionally there are historical buildings, reliefs and lesser cultural objects and jewelry. The main display is the Ishtar Gate and the Processional Way of Babylon together with the throne room facade of Nebuchadnezzar II. The Vorderasiatisches Museum also displays the Meissner fragment from the Epic of Gilgamesh.  Plans  The comprehensive plan for Museum Island includes an expansion of the Pergamon Museum, with connections to the Neues Museum, Bodemuseum, Alte Nationalgalerie and a new visitor centre, the James Simon Gallery. An architectural competition in 2000 was won by Oswald Mathias Ungers from Cologne. The Pergamon Museum will be redeveloped according to his plan, which controversially proposes large alterations to buildings unchanged since 1930. The current entrance building in the Court of Honor will be replaced with a fourth wing, and an underground walk (Arch√§ologische Promenade, archeologic walk) will connect four of the five museums. Masterplan Museumsinsel - A Projection into the Future \\"Pergamonmuseum\\" Since the end of September 2014 the museum is partially closed for renovation. The hall containing Pergamon Altar will remain closed to the general public. Initially the reopening was scheduled for 2019. Alexander Forbes \\"Berlin‚Äôs Pergamon Museum to Close until 2019, Joining Neue Nationalgalerie in Renovations\\" in \\"artnet news\\" on 19. February 2014. In November 2016 it was revealed that the renovation would not be finished before 2023 and estimated project costs would almost double to 477 million euros. Two pump houses built in the ground during the initial construction between 1910 and 1930 had been discovered causing rising costs and delays. At least 60 million euros of the increased costs are directly due to the fact that construction costs had risen since the original estimate 10 years ago. Also it was announced that a temporary exhibition space will be built opposite Museum Island, a short distance from Pergamon Museum. It will house a panorama of the ancient city by the Berlin-based artist Yadegar Asisi, a 3D reconstruction of the famous Pergamon altar by the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research and parts of the altar including the Telephos Frieze.

It is one of the major centres in the City of Lake Macquarie LGA. The lake at Toronto History The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land. Toronto was named after Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in honour of Edward Hanlan, a Canadian world-champion sculler who visited Australia in 1884. In 1885 the Excelsior Land, Investment and Building Co. and Bank Ltd acquired a portion of Threlkelds' original 1,280 acre grant from McMahon and Whiting plus the 100 ft waterfront reserve from the Crown for ¬£13,722 and subdivided it in 1887. This subdivision coincided with the opening of the Great Northern Railway and became the basis of the future town of Toronto. The area's subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land in honour of Hanlan's visit, which coincided with the opening of the subdivision. The name was not publicly used until 1887. The Canadian city's name is theoretically said to have come from the Mohawk language tkaronto, meaning where there are trees standing in the water. Toronto was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point, just to the south, is named after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position by the lake led to gradual development and population increases. The Ebenezer Aboriginal Mission closed in 1841. The Prince of Wales visited Toronto by train on the Toronto railway line on 24 June 1920. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 5,602 people in Toronto. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.1% of the population. * 82.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 3.2%. * 89.5% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.6%, Anglican 23.2% and Catholic 17.6%. Services Toronto has three public schools: Toronto High School, Toronto Primary School, and Biraban Public School. It also has three private schools, Charlton Christian College, St. Joseph's Primary School and Toronto Adventist Primary School. Toronto has three major supermarkets: Coles, Aldi, and Woolworths; as well as The Reject Shop discount store and the multi award-winning Michel's Patisserie Toronto (2016 NRA Supreme Retailer of the Year). It also has numerous clothing stores including Rushta Surf Shop, Best n Less, Rockmans, and multiple boutique stores. Toronto has a polyclinic and a private hospital. There is now a new healthcare centre called the Alec Rice Centre on the Boulevarde. Toronto has an ambulance station, police station, Fire Brigade and a Court House that serve the Western Lake Macquarie area. The Boulevarde Toronto has a high street called The Boulevarde. This road starts at the foreshore, forming a junction with Victory Parade. This road stretches westwards for 1.2 kilometres, and is the commercial hub for Toronto and its surrounding areas. The section of the road between the foreshore and Cary Street is the main retail area for Toronto. There are many boutique shops on this strip. Over the years, the streetscape has degraded and in 2013, Lake Macquarie City Council decided to start renewing the streetscape. This process began by cutting down the famous figs that line the street, and then replacing the walkways and planting more controllable trees. Work will continue into 2018. Victory Parade ;The War Memorial - Unveiled by Lt. Col. BURNAGE, 30 September 1922 Soon after its unveiling in Victory Parade, the Monument was found to be a traffic hazard, so it was moved closer to the footpath (at the entrance to the pedestrian bridge over the railway line). In 1959 it was moved to Edward Gain Park, near Wharf Street. Then in the 1964, when there was a proposal to take some of this park for a road, the Monument was moved to Goffet Park. However, no matter where it has been located, the Monument has always been the focal point for the Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services in Toronto. ;Victory Theatre NMH 2.2.1921:7 - Toronto is to have a Picture Theatre 90 ft by 40 ft wide ‚Äì Mr J Chapman has contract. Located in Victory Parade, Toronto opposite the Railway Station. Commenced screening on Wednesday 19 July 1922 by Mr George W Goffett. After having several owners, it was bought by Mr & Mrs P Crethary around 1951. CinemaScope was installed about the mid 1950s, it was the first theatre outside Newcastle to have it. The theatre closed on Saturday 12 August 1961. The last films screened were \\"The Angry Silence\\" and \\"The Gunslinger\\". The building was used by a variety of businesses including Inskip Motorcycles until 1984. The building no longer exists, as it was destroyed by fire in the early 1990s. ;Hotel Toronto Built in 1887 from locally-made bricks, the Toronto Hotel has been the best-known landmark throughout the entire history of the township. The Excelsior Company enthusiastically promoted it as \\"a pleasant and commodious brick building, containing about thirty bedrooms, besides parlors, bar, dining and billiard rooms, &c.; Standing on one of the prettiest spots upon the shores of the Lake, in its own grounds of some twenty acres, the hotel commands a fine view of a splendid reach of water extending to the little village of Belmont. The extensive pleasure grounds are laid out with croquet lawns, lawn tennis court, bowling greens, &c.; A spacious dancing pavilion has been erected for devotees of Terpsichore, while the lovers of the green cloth are provided with an excellent billiard table.\\" Now on the Register of the National Estate, the Hotel has undergone numerous alterations and renovations throughout its lifetime. It no longer dominates the skyline as it did in years gone by. Healthy and vigorous trees growing in Regatta Walk render the Hotel barely visible from Toronto's public baths and private jetties. Religion There are multiple churches in Toronto. These are: * Living Word Lakeside @ Toronto Public School * The Foursquare Church of Australia 'New Day Christian Church' on Day Street * Christ the King Anglican Church on Brighton Avenue * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on Bandalong Street * Jehovah's Witnesses Church on Excelsior Parade * Goodlife Church Toronto held at Charlton Christian College * Pentecostal 'Living Word Lakeside' Church held at Toronto Primary School on Bay Street * St. Joseph's Catholic Church on Wangi Road * Toronto Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Parkside Parade * Toronto Uniting Church on The Boulevarde * Toronto Baptist Church on the corner of The Boulevarde and Jindalee Street * Westlakes Independent Baptist Church on Ridge Road, Kilaben Bay. Transport Toronto is considered to be the hub for public transport on the western side of Lake Macquarie. The area is served by a privately operated bus service; 'Hunter Valley Buses', which services the areas to the west, south and north of the town. The closed railway station. Toronto was served by train services on the Toronto railway line until March 1990, when the NSW Government closed the line because of low passenger levels. The train service was replaced by a bus service which connects Toronto with Fassifern railway station. Train services operating from Fassifern include services to Sydney and Newcastle as well as the XPT service to Brisbane. Toronto is well served by road links to Newcastle and Sydney and is approximately 8 minutes from the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (M1). The Toronto centre serves the local communities of Kilaben Bay, Coal Point, Carey Bay, Rathmines and Wangi Wangi to the south and Teralba, Booragul, Woodrising, Fennell Bay, Bolton Point, Fassifern and Blackalls Park to the north. Sports Many Toronto residents are involved in water sports. The shore near the town has the Royal Motor Yacht Club, the Toronto Amateur Sailing Club, and a boat shop. Yachts and cruisers are moored on the lake and smaller craft are pulled up onto private land at the waters edge. Toronto is represented by three sports teams in Newcastle competitions. The Toronto Awaba Stags FC in the Northern NSW Football competition; the Macquarie Scorpions in the Newcastle Rugby League and also the Toronto Workers Kookaburras in the Newcastle cricket competition. Toronto Netball Club plays at Westlakes Netball Association. Nathan Outteridge, Olympic gold medal winner for sailing, sailed at the Toronto Amateur Sailing club in his youth. Nathan Green, winner of the 2009 RBC Canadian Open, was born when his family lived at Toronto. Toronto is also represented in Swimming by Macquarie Shores Swimming club, many Macquarie Shores swimmers compete at Regional and State level. Notes # Area calculation is based on NSW GNB maps.

He is best known for playing the roles of Chris Kositchek (he originated in 1977) and Roman Brady on the American dramatic serial Days of Our Lives, Jack McKay on the teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210 and as Michael Hogan, the father figure on NBC's situation comedy The Hogan Family. Early life Born in Princeton, Illinois as Tommy Tim Taylor and known as \\"Timmy\\", Taylor moved with his family to Chillicothe, Illinois when he was two years old. His dad became athletic director of Chillicothe Township High School (now Illinois Valley Central High School) as well as a respected football coach, and both Josh and older brother Ron played quarterback under him. Heavily recruited for his football skills, Josh chose Dartmouth College, where he was a member of two Ivy Championship teams and graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology. He then received a full scholarship to the University of Denver law school, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree. After earning his law degree, he moved to the West Coast. Career After earning his Juris Doctor, he decided to take a year off and work on the Alaska Pipeline. On the way to Alaska he stopped in Los Angeles to visit friends and was offered a job as manager of the Westwood Village Bratskeller. He spent a year and a half at the restaurant which catered to celebrities and, surrounded by actors and producers, decided to give up a future in law to pursue acting. After the Bratskeller closed, he worked as a bartender at the Riverside Lounge in Santa Monica until he snagged his first acting role playing a contemporary cowboy on an episode of Barnaby Jones in 1976. This was quickly followed with roles on The Six Million Dollar Man and The Hardy Boys. In 1977, he took the role of bartender Chris Kositchek on the soap opera Days of Our Lives. His notoriety heightened as he became an integral part of the fictional landscape of Salem, the setting of the soap, and this eventually led to primetime starring tryouts. In 1981, Taylor went to CBS and had his own short-lived detective series, Riker. His role on Days continued uninterrupted. In 1985, producers Tom Miller and Bob Boyett were casting the husband role for Valerie Harper on her new NBC series Close to Home, which was retitled Valerie before its premiere. Harper's on-screen husband, Michael Hogan, was an airline pilot who was seldom around. Taylor was called in for the part, among many other actors who were willing to settle for part-time status on the show, and earned the role. Valerie premiered in March 1986 to moderate ratings but critical success, and as the series was picked up for a second season, Taylor successfully balanced his work on the sitcom with his long-running role on Days. In 1987, behind-the-scenes events on Valerie would cause Taylor to leave Days of our Lives. Valerie Harper was fired by Lorimar-Telepictures, the series' parent studio, during that year's filming hiatus (between seasons two and three) following a contract dispute. Both her dismissal and her character's being written off as having died were controversial at the time, since the show was named after its star and lead character. Sandy Duncan was named as Harper's replacement, and Taylor felt that to ensure the continued success of the show, that he would leave Days in order expand his sitcom role. Seeing this as a foothold to a lasting role in primetime, Taylor only thought it appropriate that the Michael Hogan character would be home more often for his family, both in the wake of his wife's death and in order to help his sister (Duncan) settle into the household. The series was retitled Valerie's Family: The Hogans in September 1987, later becoming The Hogan Family (which all seasons of the show became known as syndication) in June 1988. Meanwhile, Taylor was preparing to make his last appearance as Chris Kositchek on Days. In the fall of 1987, after a ten-year run, the character had passed the bar exam and become a lawyer, serving the residents of Salem, if only for a brief period. In 1988, Taylor starred opposite Barbara Eden in the made-for-television movie, The Secret Life of Kathy McCormick, and guest starred on series including Diagnosis: Murder,Diagnosis: Murder: Murder Can Be Murder (1996)- Retrieved 2017-02-03 Walker: Texas Ranger, Murder, She Wrote, Matlock, and L.A. Law. The Hogan Family moved to CBS for its sixth season in 1990, but was canceled by the end of 1990-91 season. Taylor followed this with the pilot of the television version of North Dallas Forty. He played Jack McKay, Dylan's father, on Beverly Hills, 90210 on and off between 1991 and 1993, with occasional appearances in later seasons. In 1997, he returned to Days, this time playing the character of Roman Brady. In 2004, Roman was murdered by the Salem Stalker (who turned out to be his ex-wife, Marlena) during his and Kate's wedding reception. A few months later, it was revealed that Roman didn't die but was alive on a tropical island called Melaswen (New Salem backwards). He is still appearing on the show.

His company, Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG (Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works), was one of the mainstays of the German aircraft industry in the years between World War I and World War II. His multi-engined, all-metal passenger- and freight planes helped establish airlines in Germany and around the world. In addition to aircraft, Junkers also built both diesel and petrol engines and held various thermodynamic and metallurgical patents. He was also one of the main sponsors of the Bauhaus movement and facilitated the move of the Bauhaus from Weimar to Dessau (where his factory was situated) in 1925. Amongst the highlights of his career were the Junkers J 1 of 1915, the world's first practical all-metal aircraft, incorporating a cantilever wing design with virtually no external bracing, the Junkers F 13 of 1919 (the world's first all-metal passenger aircraft), the Junkers W 33 (which made the first successful heavier-than-air east-to-west crossing of the Atlantic Ocean), the Junkers G.38 \\"flying wing\\", and the Junkers Ju 52, affectionately nicknamed \\"Tante Ju\\", one of the most famous airliners of the 1930s. When the Nazis came into power in 1933 they requested Junkers and his businesses aid in the German re-armament. When Junkers declined, the Nazis responded by demanding ownership of all patents and market shares from his remaining companies, under threat of imprisonment on the grounds of High Treason. In 1934 Junkers was placed under house arrest, and died at home in 1935 during negotiations to give up the remaining stock and interests in Junkers. Under Nazi control, his company produced some of the most successful German warplanes of the Second World War. Biography Junkers was born in Rheydt in the Prussian Rhine Province, the son of a wealthy industrialist. After taking his Abitur exams in 1878, he attended the Royal Polytechnic University in Charlottenburg and the Royal Technical University in Aachen, where he completed his engineering studies in 1883. At first, he returned to Rheydt to work in his father's company, but soon attended further lectures on electromagnetism and thermodynamics held by Adolf Slaby in Charlottenburg. Slaby placed him with the Continental-Gasgesellschaft in Dessau, where he worked on the development of the first opposed-piston engine. To measure heating value, Junkers patented a calorimeter and founded a manufacturing company in 1892. Junkers personally introduced the calorimeter at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where it was awarded a gold medal. The next year, he patented a gas-fired bath boiler, which he refined as a tankless heater. In 1895, he founded Junkers & Co. to utilize his inventions. From 1897, he was offered a professorship of mechanical engineering at Aachen, where he lectured until 1912. Working as an engineer at the same time, Junkers taking substantial gains of Junkers & Co. devised, patented, and exploited calorimeters, domestic appliances (gas stoves), pressure regulators, gas oil engines, fan heaters, and other inventions. =Aeronautical work= Junkers on the airfield Junkers' aeronautical work began in earnest at age 50 when he worked with engineer Hans Reissner in Aachen. Reissner had developed an all- metal aircraft, on which work first started in 1909 at the Brand Heath, equipped with corrugated iron wings built by Junkers & Co. in Dessau. The iron wings were patented one year later. Junkers had a wind tunnel built and invented a hydraulic brake. He had far-sighted ideas of metal aeroplanes and flying wings, but the necessities of the war held him back. During World War I, the government forced him to focus on aircraft production. In 1915, he developed the world's first practical all-metal aircraft design, the Junkers J 1 \\"Blechesel\\"Junkers factory designations for their aircraft in the WWI period used Arabic numerals, as in the Junkers J 1 Blechesel, while the later armored J.I all-metal sesquiplane was so designated because the Kaiser's Inspektorat der Fliegertruppen army aviation inspectorate used the letter \\"J\\", followed by a Roman numeral only, to designate all armored, infantry co-operation and ground-attack aircraft, which were also designed by the Albatros and AEG firms in WWI. (Sheetmetal Donkey), which survived on display in Deutsches Museum in Munich until WWII. His firm's first military production design in 1916‚Äì17 was the armored-fuselage, two-seat, all-metal sesquiplane known by its IdFlieg designation, the Junkers J.I, considered the best German ground attack aircraft of the war. During this time, the German government's IdFlieg military aviation inspectorate forced him to merge his firm with Anthony Fokker's to form the Junkers-Fokker Aktiengesellschaft on 20 October 1917. The J.I's pattern of an armored fuselage that protected the nose-mounted engine, pilot, and observer in a unitized metal \\"bathtub\\" was the possible inspiration for Sergei Ilyushin's later Il-2 Shturmovik (conceivably appropriate as Junkers did have a manufacturing plant in Fili, a suburb of Moscow, in the Soviet Union in the 1920s) with a similar armored fuselage design. As this design philosophy for such combat aircraft had proven to be a good idea, it was once again broadly reused for the 1970s-premiered American A-10 Warthog twin-turbofan powered attack aircraft, also having its pilot enveloped in an armoured titanium bathtub. By 1918, Junkers' firm, with its previously demonstrated preference for monoplane-pattern airframe designs, had created the world's first production low-winged, single-seat monoplane all-metal fighter aircraft, the Junkers D.I, which pioneered the use of Alfred Wilm's 1906 invention of duralumin throughout a production airframe. The D.I did not enter production until 1918. He also produced a two-seat monoplane fighter, the Junkers CL.I. Both postwar Soviet aviation pioneer Andrei Tupolev and American aviation designer William Bushnell Stout owed much to Hugo Junkers in the designs of their earlier aircraft, which benefited from Junkers' corrugated, light-metal construction technique. W 33 pilots Johann Risztics (left) and Wilhelm Zimmermann (right), celebrating a world record of 65 h 25 m non-stop flight at Dessau, July 1928 The Junkers F.13 of 1919 was the first of several successful civil aircraft designs produced by Junkers Flugzeugwerke: later designs include the Junkers Ju 52/3m from 1932. Through a variety of business initiatives, Junkers was active in founding and developing airlines around the globe, initially intending to sell them aircraft. Airlines where Junkers played a pivotal role in early phases of their development include Deutsche Luft Hansa and Lloyd A√©reo Boliviano. Several business ventures failed from wider economic or political problems that hampered sound engineering plans. Junkers always had more ideas: the massive four-engined G.38, nicknamed \\"Der Grosse Dessauer\\", delivered to Luft Hansa, made no commercial trips for many months as he repeatedly recalled it to the factory for improvements. Legacy Hugo Junkers is mainly known in connection with aircraft bearing his name. These include some he reluctantly developed for the German Empire during World War I, later in minor association with Anthony Fokker, as well as civil aircraft designs during the \\"interwar period\\" produced by Junkers Flugzeugwerke (Junkers Aircraft Works). Junkers died in 1935, on his 76th birthday. The earliest all-metal post-World War I aircraft designs of both Andrei Tupolev ‚Äî with his Tupolev ANT-2 two-passenger small aircraft of 1924 ‚Äî and William Bushnell Stout's initial all-metal design, the Stout ST twin-engine torpedo bomber of 1922, were both based directly on the pioneering work of Junkers, with each engineer (one Soviet, one American) separately developing examples of aircraft like Tupolev's enormous, 63 meter wingspan, eight-engined Maksim Gorki ‚Äî the largest aircraft built anywhere in the world in the early 1930s ‚Äî and Stout's popular Ford Trimotor airliner. In 1976, Junkers was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. .

The pervasive developmental disorders were autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, i.e. all autism spectrum disorders (ASD)), childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), overactive disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements and Rett syndrome. The first four of these disorders are commonly called the autism spectrum disorders; the last disorder is much rarer, and is sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not. The terminology PDD and ASD is often used interchangeably and varies depending on location. The two have overlapping definitions but are defined differently by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10). DSM-5, removed PDD as a diagnosis and replaced it with ASD and the relative severity of the condition. ICD-10 on the other hand labels ASD as a pervasive developmental disorder with the subtypes previously mentioned. The onset of pervasive developmental disorders occurs during infancy, but the condition is usually not identified until the child is around three years old. Parents may begin to question the health of their child when developmental milestones are not met, including age appropriate motor movement and speech production. There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD.National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHCY) (October 2003) Disability Info: Pervasive Developmental Disorders (FS20). Fact Sheet 20 (FS20) Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified). Others use the general category label of PDD because they are hesitant to diagnose very young children with a specific type of PDD, such as autism. Both approaches contribute to confusion about the term, because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of PDD may include behavioral and communication problems such as: * Difficulty using and understanding language. * Difficulty relating to people, objects, and events; for example, lack of eye contact, pointing behavior, and lack of facial responses. * Unusual play with toys and other objects. * Difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings. * Repetitive body movements or behavior patterns, such as hand flapping, hair twirling, foot tapping, or more complex movements. * Inability to cuddle or be comforted. * Difficulty regulating behaviors and emotions, which may result in temper tantrums, anxiety, and aggression. * Emotional breakdowns. =Degrees= Children with PDD vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors. Some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development. Repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident. Unusual responses to sensory information - loud noises, lights - are common. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually made during early childhood. With the release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in May 2013, the diagnosis for PDD was removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorders. Distinction between the past disorders is implicated by a series of severity levels. Individuals who received diagnoses based on the DSM-IV maintain their diagnosis under the autism spectrum disorders. However, an editorial published in the October 2012 issue of American Journal of Psychiatry notes that, while some doctors argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the diagnostic distinction between ASD and PDD, multiple literature reviews found that studies showing significant differences between the two disorders significantly outnumbered those that found no difference. Unlike the DSM-5, the World Health Organization‚Äôs International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) categorizes PDD into four distinct subtypes, each with their own diagnostic criteria. The four disorders (childhood autism, atypical autism, Rett syndrome, and other childhood disintegrative disorder) are characterized by abnormalities in social interactions and communication. The disorders are primarily diagnosed based on behavioral features, although the presence of any medical conditions are important, they are not taken into account when making a diagnosis. Before the release of the DSM-5, some clinicians used PDD-NOS as a \\"temporary\\" diagnosis for children under the age of five when, for whatever reason, they are reluctant to diagnose autism. There are several justifications for this. Very young children have limited social interaction and communication skills to begin with, so it can be tricky to diagnose milder cases of autism in toddlers. The unspoken assumption is that by the age of five, unusual behaviors will either resolve or develop into diagnosable autism. However, some parents view the PDD label as no more than a euphemism for autism spectrum disorders, problematic because this label makes it more difficult to receive aid for early childhood intervention. =Classification= The pervasive developmental disorders were: * Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), which includes atypical autism, and is the most common (47% of autism diagnoses); * Typical autism, the best-known; * Asperger syndrome (9% of autism diagnoses); * Rett syndrome; and * Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). The first three of these disorders are commonly called the autism spectrum disorders; the last two disorders are much rarer, and are sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not. In May 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, Autism, Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The American Psychiatric Association has concluded that using the general diagnosis of ASD supports more accurate diagnoses. The combination of these disorders was also fueled by the standpoint that Autism is characterized by common symptoms and should therefore bear a single diagnostic term. In order to distinguish between the different disorders, the DSM-5 employs severity levels. The severity levels take into account required support, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and deficits in social communication. =PDD and PDD-NOS= There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD. Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS. Others use the general category because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label. PDD is not itself a diagnosis, while PDD-NOS is a diagnosis. To further complicate the issue, PDD- NOS can also be referred to as \\"atypical personality development\\", \\"atypical PDD\\", or \\"atypical Autism\\". Treatment Medications are used to address certain behavioral problems; therapy for children with PDD should be specialized according to the child's specific needs. Some children with PDD benefit from specialized classrooms in which the class size is small and instruction is given on a one-to-one basis. Others function well in standard special education classes or regular classes with support. Early intervention, including appropriate and specialized educational programs and support services, play a critical role in improving the outcome of individuals with PDD.

Feature extraction is related to dimensionality reduction. When the input data to an algorithm is too large to be processed and it is suspected to be redundant (e.g. the same measurement in both feet and meters, or the repetitiveness of images presented as pixels), then it can be transformed into a reduced set of features (also named a feature vector). Determining a subset of the initial features is called feature selection. The selected features are expected to contain the relevant information from the input data, so that the desired task can be performed by using this reduced representation instead of the complete initial data. General Feature extraction involves reducing the number of resources required to describe a large set of data. When performing analysis of complex data one of the major problems stems from the number of variables involved. Analysis with a large number of variables generally requires a large amount of memory and computation power, also it may cause a classification algorithm to overfit to training samples and generalize poorly to new samples. Feature extraction is a general term for methods of constructing combinations of the variables to get around these problems while still describing the data with sufficient accuracy. Many machine learning practitioners believe that properly optimized feature extraction is the key to effective model construction. Results can be improved using constructed sets of application-dependent features, typically built by an expert. One such process is called feature engineering. Alternatively, general dimensionality reduction techniques are used such as: * Independent component analysis * Isomap * Kernel PCA * Latent semantic analysis * Partial least squares * Principal component analysis * Multifactor dimensionality reduction * Nonlinear dimensionality reduction * Multilinear Principal Component Analysis * Multilinear subspace learning * Semidefinite embedding * Autoencoder Image processing One very important area of application is image processing, in which algorithms are used to detect and isolate various desired portions or shapes (features) of a digitized image or video stream. It is particularly important in the area of optical character recognition. =Low-level= * Edge detection * Corner detection * Blob detection * Ridge detection * Scale-invariant feature transform Curvature *Edge direction, changing intensity, autocorrelation.

Common numerical programming environments such as MATLAB, SciLab, NumPy, Sklearn and the R language provide some of the simpler feature extraction techniques (e.g. principal component analysis) via built-in commands. More specific algorithms are often available as publicly available scripts or third-party add-ons.

Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Heilbronn, Rems-Murr-Kreis, the district-free city Stuttgart, and the districts B√∂blingen and Enz-Kreis. History The district dates back to the Oberamt Ludwigsburg, which was created by the dukedom W√ºrttemberg in the beginning of the 19th century. After several small changes during the century, it was converted into a district in 1938. Several municipalities of the dissolved Ober√§mter Besigheim, Marbach and Waiblingen were added to the newly formed district. As a result of the communal reform of 1973, the district gained about half of the dissolved district Vaihingen, and some few municipalities from the districts Backnang and Leonberg. Geography The main river in the districts is the Neckar, which divides the district into a big western part and a smaller eastern part. Partnerships Starting in 1990 the district has a partnership with the district Chemnitzer Land in the Free State of Saxony. Even older is the partnership with the region Upper Galilee in Israel. Since 1992 the district has a partnership with the Hungarian Komitat Pest, however the official signing of the partnership contract did take place in 2002. A friendship exists with the city Yichang in the province Hubei, China. Coat of arms The imperial eagle in the coat of arms is taken from the arms of the city Markgr√∂ningen, which was an imperial city. It was later adopted by the city Ludwigsburg as well.

Clinicians' decisions regarding patients' treatment are often influenced by this standard of care (SOC). They are most widespread SOC used by professionals working with transsexual, transgender, or gender variant people. However, other sets of SOCs, protocols and guidelines do exist, especially outside the United States.  History  Prior to the advent of the first SOCs, there was no semblance of consensus on psychiatric, psychological, medical, and surgical requirements or procedures. Before the 1960s, few countries offered safe, legal medical options and many criminalized cross-gender behaviors or mandated unproven psychiatric treatments. In response to this problem, the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (now known as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)) authored one of the earliest sets of clinical guidelines for the express purpose of ensuring \\"lasting personal comfort with the gendered self in order to maximize overall psychological well-being and self-fulfillment.\\" The WPATH-SOC are periodically updated and revised. The latest revision was released September 25, 2011. This is the seventh version of the WPATH-SOC since the original 1979 document was drafted. Previous revisions were released in 1980, 1981, 1990, 1998, and 2001. = Sixth Version = The sixth revision recommends that mental health professionals document a patient's relevant history in a letter, which should be required by medical professionals prior to physical intervention. One letter is required for hormone replacement therapy or either augmentation mammoplasty or male chest reconstruction. Two additional letters are needed for genital surgeries.\\"The Mental Health Professional.\\" The World Professional Association for Transgender Health's Standards Of Care For Gender Identity Disorders. 6th ed. 2001. The Eligibility Criteria and Readiness Criteria in version 6 give certain very specific minimum requirements as prerequisites to HRT or sex reassignment surgery (SRS). Section Nine covers \\"The Real-life Experience,\\" during which individuals seeking hormonal and other treatments are expected to begin transitioning publicly to their preferred gender role. Section Twelve, titled \\"Genital Surgery,\\" deals directly with all concerns about sex reassignment surgery. It includes six \\"Eligibility Criteria\\" and two \\"Readiness Criteria\\", which are intended to be used by professionals for both diagnosis and guidance before providing patients \\"letters of recommendation.\\" For this and other reasons, the WPATH-SOC is a controversial and often maligned document among patients seeking medical intervention (hormones, and/or surgery), who state that their legally protected right to proper medical care and treatment is unjustly and unduly withheld or even denied based on the SOC. The assessment and treatment of children and adolescents was covered in section V of version 6. Version 7 Included in the guidelines are sections on purpose and use of the WPATH-SOC, the global applicability of the WPATH-SOC, the difference between gender nonconformity and gender dysphoria, epidemiology, treatment of children, adolescents and adults, mental health, hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male or male-to-female; HRT), reproductive health, voice and communication therapy, sex reassignment surgery, lifelong preventive and primary care, applicability of the WPATH-SOC to people living in institutional environments, and applicability of the WPATH-SOC to people with disorders of sex development.  Criticism of the WPATH-SOC  Numerous criticisms have been made against the WPATH-SOC over the course of its history, some of which are reflected in later versions of the guidelines. Most of these criticisms are related to the strictness of the requirements, noting that the rate of post-surgical regret among transsexual people is very low ‚Äî lower than many medically necessary and cosmetic procedures with less stringent requirements. Provisions related to the necessity of real-life experience (noting that requiring real-life experience in an incongruous anatomical/social role can be both mentally harmful as well as physically dangerous to the individual) have been particularly under fire. For many, it is safe only to express gender outwardly in limited settings (8/7, 12/7 or 18/7) rather than all day, every day (24/7). This is now taken into consideration in version 7. The WPATH SOC version 6 and 7 allow for referral for puberty blocking medication to be prescribed to youth experiencing puberty, starting at Tanner stage 2 or above. Referral after that age could lead to bodily changes reversible only with surgery (facial shape, secondary sex characteristics); surgically risky (voice pitch); or, irreversible changes (skeletal structure or height). The WPATH SOC version 7 has also removed the set length of time for psychotherapy, in order to facilitate support and referral to transition services in a timely way, should they be required. These changes have led some critics to claim that the criteria are too loose, however, an individualized approach that provides prospective, supportive follow-up and education to families about how to affirm expression, and create an environment for safe exploration has always been recommended. WPATH has also come under fire for adopting pathological language when referring to Intersex individuals in its latest revision, SOC 7. The SOC uses the term \\"Disorders of Sex development\\" even though many Intersex individuals don't consider their biological differences a disorder, and argue that the language used by the SOC is stigmatizing and offensive.  Other SOCs, protocols and guidelines for treatment of Gender Dysphoria  In some countries or areas, local standards of care exist, such as in the Netherlands, Germany or Italy. Also, some health care providers have their own set of SOCs which have to be followed to have access to health care. The criticism about the WPATH-SOCs applies to these as well; some of these SOCs are based on much older versions of the WPATH-SOCs, or are entirely independent of them. A more lenient version that has been increasing in acceptance is the Health Law Standards Of Care, developed by the Health Law Project (also known as the ICTLEP guidelines), which is based on a harm-reduction model. Treatment according to older SOCs is often reserved for transsexual people only, not for other transgender people, who might not want to undergo the complete set of treatments, or who see themselves outside a binary gender system. Such older SOCs are often used to withhold medical interventions from transgender people altogether. In other regions, notably Latin America, surgeons follow no particular set standards and use their own criteria for eligibility for surgery. In Western countries the emphasis is on psychiatry or psychology; typically, in Latin America, the emphasis is on the ability to \\"pass\\", and in Thailand the emphasis is on cross-living experience.

Early life She was born Amy Lyon in Swan Cottage, Ness near Neston, Cheshire, England, the daughter of Henry Lyon, a blacksmith who died when she was two months old. She was raised by her mother, the former Mary Kidd (later Cadogan), and grandmother, Sarah Kidd, at Hawarden, and received no formal education. She later went by the name of Emma Hart. Emma as Circe, by George Romney, 1782 Mary Lyon, left with a 2-month-old daughter after her husband had died in somewhat mysterious circumstances, returned to her family home across the Dee, where her mother Sarah Kidd helped to raise Emma, forming a bond which they maintained throughout their lives. With her grandmother struggling to make ends meet at the age of 60, and after Mary went to London in 1777 (possibly having lost a source of income through a lover employed at Sir John Glynne's estate), Emma began work, aged 12, as a maid at the Hawarden home of Doctor Honoratus Leigh Thomas, a surgeon working in Chester. Only a few months later she was unemployed again (possibly dismissed) and took the stage coach to London in autumn 1777, where she started work for the Budd family in Chatham Place, Blackfriars, London, and met a maid called Jane Powell, who wanted to be an actress. Emma joined in with Jane's rehearsals for various tragic roles. Pretty and ambitious, Emma started work at the Drury Lane theatre in Covent Garden, as maid to various actresses, among them Mary Robinson. Emma next worked as a model and dancer at the \\"Goddess of Health\\" (also known as the \\"Temple of Health\\") for James Graham, a Scottish \\"quack\\" doctor. The establishment's greatest attraction was a bed through which electricity was passed, giving paying patrons mild shocks. This supposedly aided conception, and many infertile couples paid high prices to try it. At fifteen, Emma met Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, who hired her for several months as hostess and entertainer at a lengthy stag party at Fetherstonhaugh's Uppark country estate in the South Downs. She is said to have entertained Harry and his friends by dancing in the nude on the dining room table. citing Uppark and its people by M Meade-Fetherstonhaugh. Fetherstonhaugh took Emma there as a mistress, but frequently ignored her in favour of drinking and hunting with his friends. Emma soon formed a friendship with one of the guests, the dull but sincere Honourable Charles Francis Greville (1749‚Äì1809), second son of the then Earl of Warwick and a member of Parliament for Warwick. It was about this time (late June-early July 1781) that she conceived a child by Fetherstonhaugh. Fetherstonhaugh was furious at the unwanted pregnancy and Emma appealed to Greville. Greville took her in as his mistress, on condition that the child was fostered out. Once the child (Emma Carew) was born, she was removed to be raised by her great-grandmother at Hawarden for her first three years, and subsequently (after a short spell in London with her mother) deposited with Mr John Blackburn, schoolmaster, and his wife in Manchester. As a young woman, Emma's daughter saw her mother reasonably frequently, but later when Emma fell into debt, her daughter worked abroad as a companion or governess. Greville kept Emma in a small house at Edgware Row, Paddington Green, at this time a village on the rural outskirts of London. Emma was at Greville's mercy and acceded to his requests to change her name to \\"Mrs Emma Hart\\", to dress in modest outfits in subdued colours and eschew a social life. He arranged for Emma's mother, then in her thirties, who had by now taken on the name of Cadogan (possibly from a John Cadogan who lived in the area, although no marriage is recorded) to live with her as housekeeper and chaperone. Greville also taught her to enunciate more elegantly, and after a while, started to invite some of his friends to meet her. Seeing an opportunity to make some money by taking a cut of sales, Greville sent her to sit for his friend, the painter George Romney, who was looking for a new model and muse. It was then that Emma became the subject of many of Romney's most famous portraits, and soon became London's biggest celebrity. In fact, so began Romney's lifelong obsession with her, sketching her nude and clothed in many poses that he later used to create paintings in her absence. Through the popularity of Romney's work and particularly of his striking-looking young model, Emma became well known in society circles, under the name of \\"Emma Hart\\". She was witty, intelligent, a quick learner, elegant and, as paintings of her attest, extremely beautiful. Romney was fascinated by her looks and ability to adapt to the ideals of the age. Romney and other artists painted her in many guises, foreshadowing her later \\"attitudes\\". Another portrait by George Romney, circa 1785 In 1783, Greville needed to find a rich wife to replenish his finances, and found a fit in the form of eighteen-year-old heiress Henrietta Middleton. Emma would be a problem, as he disliked being known as her lover (this having become apparent to all through her fame in Romney's artworks), and his prospective wife would not accept him as a suitor if he lived openly with Emma Hart. To be rid of Emma, Greville persuaded his uncle, younger brother of his mother, Sir William Hamilton, British Envoy to Naples, to take her off his hands. Greville's marriage would be useful to Sir William, as it relieved him of having Greville as a poor relation. To promote his plan, Greville suggested to Sir William that Emma would make a very pleasing mistress, assuring him that, once married to Henrietta Middleton, he would come and fetch Emma back. Sir William, then 55 and newly widowed, had arrived back in London for the first time in over five years. Emma's famous beauty was by then well known to Sir William, so much so that he even agreed to pay the expenses for her journey to ensure her speedy arrival. A great collector of antiquities and beautiful objects, he took interest in her as another acquisition. He had long been happily married until the death of his wife in 1782, and he liked female companionship. His home in Naples was well known all over the world for hospitality and refinement. He needed a hostess for his salon, and from what he knew about Emma, he thought she would be the perfect choice. Greville did not inform Emma of his plan, but instead in 1785 suggested the trip as a prolonged holiday in Naples while he (Greville) was away in Scotland on business, not long after Emma's mother had suffered a stroke. Emma was thus sent to Naples, supposedly for six to eight months, little realising that she was going as the mistress of her host. Emma set off for Naples with her mother and Gavin Hamilton on 13 March 1786 overland in an old coach, and arrived in Naples on her 21st birthday on 26 April.

She was furious when she realised what Greville had planned for her, but eventually started to enjoy life in Naples and responded to Sir William's intense courtship just before Christmas in 1786. They fell in love, Sir William forgot about his plan to take her on as a temporary mistress, and Emma moved into his apartments, leaving her mother downstairs in the ground floor rooms. Emma was unable to attend Court yet, but Sir William took her to every other party, assembly and outing. They were married on 6 September 1791 at St Marylebone Parish Church, then a plain small building, having returned to England for the purpose and Sir William having gained the King's consent. She was twenty-six and he was sixty. Although she was obliged to use her legal name of Amy Lyon on the marriage register, the wedding gave her the title Lady Hamilton which she would use for the rest of her life. Hamilton's public career was now at its height and during their visit he was inducted into the Privy Council. Shortly after the ceremony, Romney painted his last portrait of Emma from life, The Ambassadress, after which he plunged into a deep depression and drew a series of frenzied sketches of Emma. The newly married couple returned to Naples after two days. After the marriage, Greville transferred the cost of Emma Carew's upkeep to Sir William, and suggested that he might move her to an establishment befitting the stepdaughter of an envoy. However, Sir William preferred to forget about her for a while. Emma Hart, Lady Hamilton (c 1765‚Äì1815), as Circe at Waddesdon Manor. This is the first portrait in which Romney painted Emma in this guise, painted in July to August 1782. Life in Naples and the \\"Attitudes\\" Emma performing the \\"Attitudes\\", caricatured by Thomas Rowlandson Lady Hamilton as Ariadne by √âlisabeth Vig√©e- Lebrun, 1790 Lady Hamilton became a close friend of Queen Maria Carolina, sister of Marie Antoinette and wife of Ferdinand I of Naples, and soon acquired fluency in both French and Italian. She was also a talented amateur singer. She sang one of the solo parts of Joseph Haydn's Nelson Mass and entertained guests at her home. At one point, the Royal Opera in Madrid tried to engage her for a season, in competition with their star, Angelica Catalani, but that offer was turned down. Sharing Sir William Hamilton's enthusiasm for classical antiquities and art, she developed what she called her \\"Attitudes\\"‚Äîtableaux vivants in which she portrayed sculptures and paintings before British visitors.Quintin Colville, p52 BBC History Magazine, December 2016 Emma developed the attitudes, also known as mimoplastic art, by using Romney's idea of combining classical poses with modern allure as the basis for her act. Emma had her dressmaker make dresses modelled on those worn by peasant islanders in the Bay of Naples, and the loose-fitting garments she often wore when modelling for Romney. She would pair these tunics with a few large shawls or veils, draping herself in folds of cloth and posing in such a way as to evoke popular images from Greco-Roman mythology. This cross between postures, dance and acting was first revealed in spring 1787 by Sir William at his home in Naples to a large group of European guests, who quickly took to this new form of entertainment. It formed a sort of charade, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes Emma portrayed. The performance was a sensation with visitors from across Europe. With the aid of her shawls, Emma posed as various classical figures from Medea to Queen Cleopatra, and her performances charmed aristocrats, artists such as √âlisabeth-Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun, writers‚Äîincluding the great Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Her Attitudes are described by Goethe in his Italian Journey, diary of March 16 and May 27, 1787. ‚Äîand kings and queens alike, setting off new dance trends across Europe and starting a fashion for a draped Grecian style of dress. \\"Attitudes\\" were taken up by several other (female) artists, among them Ida Brun from Denmark, who became Emma's successor in the new art form. The famed sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen admired her art. \\"Attitudes\\" were a form of \\"mime art\\", which disappeared for a long time, only to surface again in the 20th century. Emma developed her Attitudes from mere poses into small, wordless plays‚Äîin her later years she excelled most as Medea. Meeting with Nelson As wife of the British Envoy, Emma welcomed Nelson (who had been married to Fanny Nisbet for about 6 years at that point) after his arrival in Naples on 10 September 1793, when he came to gather reinforcements against the French. She is described in 1797 in the diary of 18-year-old Elizabeth Wynne as \\"a charming woman, beautiful and exceedingly good humoured and amiable.\\" When he set sail for Sardinia on 15 September after only 5 days in Naples, it was clear that he had already fallen a little in love. After four years of marriage, Emma had despaired of having children with Sir William, although she wrote of him as \\"the best husband and friend\\". It seems likely that he was sterile. She once again tried to persuade him to allow her daughter to come and live with them in the Palazzo Sessa as her mother Mrs Cadogan's niece, but he refused this as well as her request to make enquiries in England about suitors for the young Emma. Nelson returned to Naples five years later, on 22 September 1798 a living legend, after his victory at the Battle of the Nile in Aboukir, with his step-son Josiah Nisbet, then eighteen years old. By this time, Nelson's adventures had prematurely aged him; he had lost an arm and most of his teeth, and was afflicted by coughing spells. Before his arrival, Emma had written a letter passionately expressing her admiration for him, and reportedly flung herself upon him in admiration, calling out, \\"Oh God, is it possible?\\", as she fainted against him. Nelson even wrote effusively of Emma to his increasingly estranged wife. Emma and Sir William escorted Nelson to their home, the Palazzo Sessa. In A Cognocenti contemplating ye Beauties of ye Antique (1801), James Gillray caricatured Sir William's attitude towards the affair between Emma and Nelson. Emma is the portrait of \\"Cleopatra\\" in the upper left, and Nelson is the adjacent \\"Mark Antony\\". Emma nursed Nelson under her husband's roof, dazzled him with her attention, and arranged a party with 1,800 guests to celebrate his 40th birthday on 29 September. She also worked hard to bring Nelson's step-son, the sullen Josiah Nisbet, out of his shell. After the party, Emma became Nelson's secretary, translator and political facilitator. They soon fell in love and their affair seems to have been tolerated, and perhaps even encouraged, by the elderly Sir William, whose own health was now failing and who longed for retirement. Hamilton showed nothing but admiration and respect for Nelson, and vice versa. By November, the gossip from Naples about their affair reached the English newspapers, and Fanny also had to read her husband's letters full of praise for the Hamiltons. Emma Hamilton and Horatio Nelson were by now the two most famous Britons in the world. Emma had by then become not only a close personal friend of Queen Maria Carolina, but had developed into an important political influence. She advised the Queen on how to react to the threats from the French Revolution. Maria Carolina's sister Marie Antoinette had fallen a victim to the Revolution. In 1799, Naples was the scene of a strange revolution led by members of the aristocracy; the common people did not agree with the revolution. The French troops were not welcome, but the royal family fled to Sicily. From here Nelson tried to help the royal family put down the revolutionaries. He had absolutely no support from the British government. He even allowed one of the leaders of the revolution, Admiral Francesco Caracciolo, to be executed for treason. Emma Hamilton tried to draw a parallel between the revolution in Naples and the Irish uprising in 1798. Emma played an important role in helping to put an end to the revolution when she arrived off Naples with Nelson's fleet on 24 June 1799. She acted as a go-between, conveying messages from the queen to Nelson and from Nelson to the queen. Life in London and at Merton Nelson's recall to Britain shortly afterwards coincided with the government finally granting Hamilton's request for relief from his post in Naples. Emma must have become pregnant around April 1800. Nelson, Emma, her mother and William travelled together‚Äîtaking the longest possible route back to Britain via Central Europe (hearing the Missa in Angustiis by Joseph Haydn, now known as the \\"Nelson Mass\\" in Vienna in 1800), and eventually arriving in Yarmouth to a hero's welcome on 6 November 1800. Upon arrival in London on 8 November, the three of them took suites at Nerot's Hotel after a missed communication from Nelson to his wife about receiving the party at their home, Roundwood. Lady Nelson and Nelson's father arrived and they all dined at the hotel, with Fanny deeply unhappy to see Emma pregnant. The affair soon became public knowledge, and to the delight of the newspapers, Fanny did not accept the affair as placidly as Sir William. Emma was winning the media war at that point, and every fine lady was experimenting with her look. Nelson contributed to Fanny's misery by being cruel to her when not in Emma's company. Sir William was mercilessly lampooned in the press, but his sister observed that he doted on Emma and she was very attached to him. The Hamiltons moved into William Beckford's mansion at 22 Grosvenor Square, and Nelson and Fanny took an expensive furnished house at 17 Dover Street, a comfortable walking distance away, until December, when Sir William rented a home at 23 Piccadilly, opposite Green Park. On 1 January, Nelson's promotion to vice admiral was confirmed and he prepared to go to sea on the same night. Infuriated by Fanny's handing him an ultimatum to choose between her and his mistress, Nelson chose Emma and decided to take steps to formalise separation from his wife. He never saw her again, after being hustled out of town by an agent. While he was at sea, Nelson and Emma exchanged many letters, using a secret code to discuss Emma's condition. Emma kept her first daughter Emma Carew's existence a secret from Nelson, while Sir William continued to provide for her. =Birth of Horatia= Emma gave birth to Nelson's daughter Horatia, on 29 January 1801 at 23 Piccadilly, who was taken soon afterwards to a Mrs Gibson for care and hire of a wet nurse. On 1 February, Emma made a spectacular appearance at a concert at the house of the Duke of Norfolk in St James' Square, and Emma worked hard to keep the press onside. Soon after this, the Prince of Wales (later King George IV) became infatuated with Emma, leading Nelson to be consumed by jealousy, and inspiring a remarkable letter by Sir William to Nelson, assuring him that she was being faithful. In late February, Nelson returned to London and met his daughter at Mrs Gibson's. Nelson's family were aware of the pregnancy, and his clergyman brother Rev. William Nelson wrote to Emma praising her virtue and goodness. Nelson and Emma continued to write letters to each other when he was away at sea, and she kept every one. While he was away too, she arranged for her mother to visit the Kidds in Hawarden and her daughter in Manchester. By the autumn of the same year, upon Emma's advice, Nelson bought Merton Place, a small ramshackle house at Merton, near Wimbledon, for ¬£9,000, borrowing money from his friend Davison. He gave her free rein with spending to improve the property, and her vision was to transform the house into a celebration of his genius. There they lived together openly, with Sir William and Emma's mother, in a m√©nage √† trois that fascinated the public. Emma turned herself to winning over Nelson's family, nursing his 80-year-old father Edmund for 10 days at Merton, who loved her and thought of moving in with them, but could not bear to leave his beloved Norfolk. Emma also made herself useful to Nelson's sisters Kitty (Catherine), married to George Matcham, and Susanna, married to Thomas Bolton, by helping to raise their children and to make ends meet. Nelson's sister-in-law Sarah (married to William), also pressed him for assistance and favours, including the payment of their son Horatio's school fees at Eton. Also around this time, Emma finally told Nelson about her daughter Emma Carew, now known as Emma Hartley, and found that she had had nothing to worry about; he invited her to stay at Merton and soon grew fond of \\"Emma's relative\\". An unpublished letter shows that Nelson assumed responsibility for upkeep of young Emma at this time. After the Treaty of Amiens on 25 March 1802, Nelson was released from active service, but wanted to keep his new-found position in society by maintaining an aura of wealth, and Emma worked hard to live up to this dream. Nelson's father became seriously ill in April, but Nelson did not visit him in Norfolk (possibly fearing a meeting with Fanny), staying home to celebrate Emma's 37th birthday with a big party on the very day that Edmund died, and did not attend the funeral. =Death of Sir William= The newspapers reported on their every move, including trips to Wales to inspect Sir William's estates and a holiday to Ramsgate intended to give him some peace and quiet, looking to Emma to set fashions in dress, home decoration and even dinner party menus. By the autumn of 1803, Sir William's health was declining, at the same time that the peace with France was disintegrating. A \\"Children's Ball\\" was thrown after New Year, in honour of Horatia, and a concert for 100 guests staged in February. But soon afterwards, Sir William collapsed at 23 Piccadilly and on 6 April died in Emma's arms, and Emma's creditors closed in. Charles Greville was the executor of the estate and he instructed her to leave 23 Piccadilly, but for the sake of respectability, she had to keep an address separate from Nelson's and so moved into 11 Clarges Street, not far away, a couple of months later. Greville, furious at the extent of the debts left in the estate, was not willing to do Emma any favours. In addition, Sir William had not written fairly about Emma's role in the vital espionage of 1795, inflating his own role, so the government did not consider her worthy of a pension. In the meantime, Nelson was offered the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, and they rushed to have Horatia christened at Marylebone Parish Church before he left. On her baptism record, her name was recorded as Horatia Nelson Thompson, and her date of birth falsely recorded as 29 October 1800 in order to continue the pretence that she had been born in Naples and was godchild of Emma and Nelson, according to Kate Williams and based on an unpublished letter; however the only publicly available transcription of the record shows 29 October 1801.\\"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JQYW-Z3J : 11 February 2018, Horatia Nelson Thompson, 29 Oct 1801) Nelson later wrote a letter explaining that the child was an orphan \\"left to his care and protection\\" in Naples. Emma planned, paid for and hosted the wedding of Nelson's niece Kitty Bolton (daughter of Susanna) and her cousin Captain Sir William Bolton (Nelson's sister Susanna's husband's brother's son) at 23 Piccadilly on 18 May 1803,Doc via Ancestry, from London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1932, for Catherine Bolton Westminster St George, Hanover Square 1800-1805, from London Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Reference Number: DL/T/089/002 the same day as Nelson's early morning departure to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, leaving Emma pregnant with their second child (although neither knew it at this time). The marriage was witnessed by Charlotte Mary Nelson (Nelson's brother William's daughter) and \\"Emma Hartley\\" (Emma's daughter Emma Carew). =Nelson at sea again= She was desperately lonely, preoccupied with attempting to turn Merton Place into the grand home Nelson desired, suffering from several ailments and frantic for his return. The child, a girl (reportedly named Emma), died about 6 weeks after her birth in early 1804, and Horatia also fell ill at her home with Mrs Gibson on Titchfield Street. Emma kept the infant's death a secret from the press (her burial is unrecorded), kept her deep grief from Nelson's family and found it increasingly difficult to cope alone. She reportedly distracted herself by gambling, and succumbed to binges of heavy drinking and eating and spending lavishly. Emma received several marriage proposals during 1804, all wealthy men, but she was still in love with Nelson and believed that he would become wealthy with prize money and leave her rich in his will, and she refused them all. She continued to entertain and help Nelson's relatives, especially William and Sarah's \\"obstreperous son Horace\\" and their daughter Charlotte, who was referred to as Emma's \\"foster daughter\\" in a letter. Nelson urged her to keep Horatia at Merton, and when his return seemed imminent in 1804, Emma ran up bills on furnishing and decorating Merton. Five-year-old Horatia came to live at Merton in May 1805. There were also reports that she holidayed with Emma Carew. After a brief visit to England in August 1805, Nelson once again had to return to service. Emma received letters from him on 1, 7 and 13 October. On the ship, he wrote a note intended as a codicil to his will requesting that, in return for his legacy to King and Country that they should give Emma \\"ample provision to maintain her rank in life\\", and that his \\"adopted daughter, Horatia Nelson Thompson...use in future the name of Nelson only\\". =Nelson's death= On 21 October 1805, Nelson's fleet defeated a joint Franco-Spanish naval force at the Battle of Trafalgar. Nelson was seriously wounded during the battle and died three hours later. When the news of his death arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news to Lady Hamilton. She later recalled, > They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. 'Show him in directly,' > I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, 'We > have gained a great Victory.' ‚Äì 'Never mind your Victory,' I said. 'My > letters ‚Äì give me my letters' ‚Äì Captain Whitby was unable to speak ‚Äì tears > in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I > believe I gave a scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither > speak nor shed a tear. Emma lay in bed prostrate with grief for many weeks, often receiving visitors in tears. It was some weeks before she heard that Nelson's last words were of her and that he had begged the nation to take care of her and Horatia. After William and Sarah distanced themselves from her (William being elated upon hearing that Nelson had not changed his will), she relied on Nelson's sisters (Kitty Matcham and Susanna Bolton) for moral support and company. Like her, the Boltons and Matchams had spent lavishly in expectation of Nelson's victorious return, and Emma gave them and other of his friends and relations money. Final years Horatia Ward n√©e Nelson Nelson's will was read in November; William inherited his entire estate (including Bronte) except for Merton, as well as his bank accounts and possessions. The government had made William an Earl and his son Horatio (aka Horace) a Viscount - the titles Nelson had aspired to - and now he was also Duke of Bronte. Emma received ¬£2000, Merton, and ¬£500 per annum from the Bronte estate - much less than she had when Nelson was alive, and not enough to maintain Merton. In spite of Nelson's status as a national hero, the instructions he left to the government to provide for Emma and Horatia were ignored; they also ignored his wishes that she should sing at his funeral. The funeral was one of the most lavish commemorations in British history, costing the state ¬£14,000, but Emma was excluded. Only the men of the Bolton and Matcham family were invited, and Emma spent the day with her family and the women. She gave both families dinner and breakfast and accommodated the Boltons, and probably received William and Horace. After the funeral, the begging letters began. William would not help, so everybody turned to Emma. Lord Grenville sent the codicil to Nelson's will to his solicitor with a note saying that nothing could be done; instead, the Boltons and Matchams received ¬£10,000 each (but still left their adolescent daughters with Emma to educate), while William was awarded ¬£100,000 to buy an estate called Trafalgar, as well as ¬£5000 for life. Relations between William and Emma became strained and he refused to give her the ¬£500 pension due to her. Emma was especially hurt by Lady Charlotte's rebuff, partly because she had spent about ¬£2000 paying for her education, clothes, presents and holidays but also because she had grown fond of her. She spent 1806 to 1808 keeping up the act, continuing to spend on parties and alterations to Merton to make it a monument to Nelson. Goods that Nelson had ordered arrived and had to be paid for. The annual annuity of ¬£800 from Sir William's estate was not enough to pay off the debts and keep up the lifestyle, and Emma fell deeply into debt.Quintin Colville, p54 BBC History Magazine, December 2016 She moved from Clarges Street to a cheaper home at 136 Bond Street, but could not bring herself to relinquish Merton. Her brother, William, blackmailed her into giving him money, and Mrs Cadogan's sister's family, the Connors, were also expecting handouts. Emma Carew came for a short summer visit in late June 1806, at which point Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh sent ¬£500 for the benefit of mother and daughter. Emma hosted and employed James Harrison for 6 months to write a two-volume Life of Nelson, which made it clear that Horatia was his child. Still her company was sought after in society, and she continued to entertain at Merton, including the Prince of Wales and the Dukes of Sussex and Clarence, but no favours were returned by the royals. Within three years, Emma was more than ¬£15,000 in debt. In June 1808, Merton failed to sell at auction. She was not completely without friends; her neighbours had rallied, and Sir John Perring hosted a group of influential financiers to help organise her finances and sell Merton. It was eventually sold in April 1809. However, her lavish spending continued, and a combination of this and the steady depletion of funds due to people fleecing her meant that she remained in debt, although unbeknownst to most people. Her mother, Mrs Cadogan, died in January 1810.London Metro Archives, London, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812, Westminster, St Mary, Paddington Green,1790-1812. For most of 1811 and 1812 she was in a virtual debtors' prison, and in December 1812 either chose to commit herself (her name does not appear in the record books) or was sentenced to a prison sentence at the King's Bench Prison in Southwark, although she was not kept in a cell but allowed to live in rooms nearby with Horatia, as per the system whereby genteel prisoners could buy the rights to live \\"within the Rules\\", a three- square-mile area around the prison. In early 1813 she petitioned the Prince of Wales, the government and friends, but all of her requests failed and she was obliged to auction off many of her possessions, including many Nelson relics, at low prices. However she continued to borrow money at extortionate interest rates in order to keep up the show and in entertaining possible patrons at huge dinners. Public opinion turned against her (and Nelson to some extent) after the Letters of Lord Nelson to Lady Hamilton were published in book form in April 1814. Emma was anxious to leave the country, but owing to the risk of arrest if she travelled on a normal ferry, she and Horatia hid from her creditors for a week before boarding a private vessel bound for Calais on 1 July 1814, with ¬£50 in her purse. Initially taking apartments at the expensive Dessein's Hotel, she initially kept up a social life and fine dining by relying on creditors. Her old housekeeper, Dame Francis, came to run the household and hired other servants. But soon she was deeply in debt and suffering from longstanding health problems, including stomach pains, nausea and diarrhoea. She turned to the Roman Catholic church and joined the St Pierre congregation. Death In November they moved into a cheap flat at 27 Rue Fran√ßaise and in an effort to dull the pain Emma drank spirits and took laudanum. She died on 15 January 1815, aged 49, of amoebic dysentery‚Äî \\\\- the marking plaque - an illness she probably contracted during her years in Naples (Sir William Hamilton had also suffered from amoebic dysentery)‚Äîand consequent organ failure. Emma was buried in Calais on 21 January in public ground outside the town, with her faithful friend Joshua Smith paying for the modest funeral at the Catholic church. It was reported that \\"all the English gentlemen in Calais attended\\". Her grave was subsequently lost due to wartime destruction, but in 1994 a dedicated group unveiled the memorial which stands today in the Parc Richelieu in her honour.The first memorial to Emma, Lady Hamilton, Parc Richelieu, Calais, France, erected by The 1805 Club in 1994.Lady Hamilton, Historic site and monument. Office de Tourisme Calais C√¥te d'Opale. Henry Cadogan cared for the 14-year-old Horatia in the aftermath of Emma's death and paid for her travel to Dover. The Matchams took her in to care for their younger children, until she was sent off to live with the Boltons two years later, Susanna having died in 1813. Horatia subsequently married the Rev. Philip Ward, had ten children (the first of whom was named Horatio Nelson) and lived until 1881. Horatia never publicly acknowledged that she was the daughter of Emma Hamilton. Jason M. Kelly sums up her life thus at the end of his essay on Emma's education in Naples: \\"In a world of aristocratic privilege and powerful men, her common birth and gender ultimately circumscribed her options\\". Honours and heraldry Emma Hamilton is generally known by the courtesy title of \\"Lady Hamilton\\", to which she was entitled from 1791 as the wife and then widow of Sir William Hamilton, but in 1800, she became \\"Dame Emma Hamilton\\", a title she held in her own right as a female member of the Order of Malta. This was an unusual and possibly unique honour,Williams 2006, p, 234.Anon. (1837), \\"Nelsonian Reminiscences\\", Metropolitan Magazine, 19 (1837), p. 252.p. 252 which was awarded to Lady Hamilton by the then Grand Master of the Order, Tsar Paul, in recognition of her role in the defence of the island of Malta against the French.Pettigrew 1849, vol. i., p. 324.Nicolas 1845, vol. iv, p. 192, n. 3. Subsequently, she used her new title in formal circumstances,Pettigrew 1849, vol. ii., p. 631, n.1. and was also acknowledged as \\"Dame Emma Hamilton\\" in official British contexts; most notably, this was the title under which she was formally granted her own coat of arms by the English College of Arms in 1806, Per pale Or and Argent, three Lions rampant Gules, on a chief Sable, a Cross of eight points of the second.Pettigrew 1849, vol. ii., pp. 619-20. The lions evidently refer to her maiden surname of Lyons, while the addition of the Maltese Cross, which has puzzled heraldic scholars unaware of her connection to the Order, is recognisable as an honourable augmentation referring to her damehood.

Although he was a patrician by birth, his family had long been impoverished and was unimportant; Ronald Syme notes, \\"The sole and last consul of that family\\", Sextus Quinctilius Varus, \\"had been two years antecedent to the Decemvirs\\" (i.e. 453 BC).Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 313 His father, Sextus Quinctilius Varus, was a senator who had served as a quaestor in 49 BC. This Sextus aligned with the Senatorial Party in the civil war against Julius Caesar.Caesar Commentarii de Bello Civili 1.23, 2.28.1 Although Sextus survived the defeat, it is unknown whether he was involved in the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar. Sextus committed suicide after the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC.Velleius Paterculus, 2.71.2. The mother of Varus is unknown; Syme notes that \\"no relatives on either side of the family can be discovered or surmised.\\" Varus had three sisters, all named Quinctilia. They were probably all younger based on when they started having children, so it seems likely he was born at least four years before his father's suicide. The fact that they had advantageous marriages indicates someone was involved in their upbringing. One sister married Publius Cornelius Dolabella, consul of 35 BC; another married the Roman senator Sextus Appuleius, consul in 29; and the third married Lucius Nonius Asprenas, son of the consul of 36 BC.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, pp. 315-318 Despite Varus‚Äô father's political allegiances, he became one of the supporters of the heir of Julius Caesar, Octavian. When Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa died in early 12 BC, Varus delivered his funeral eulogy alongside the future emperor, Tiberius.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 146 His political career was boosted and he achieved the consulate in 13 BC, when he was elected as the colleague of Tiberius, the stepson and eventual successor of Augustus.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 457 Marriages and children Varus married a Vipsania, a daughter of Agrippa, at an unknown date before 13 BC.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p.65; Severy, Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Roman Empire, pp. 64-5 follow Sir Ronald Syme that Varus married three times and his first wife is unknown. But there is no proof for this, it is merely Syme's opinion. Likewise, the mother of Vipsania is also uncertain. Some think her Claudia Marcella Major, e.g. Severy, Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Roman Empire, p.p.64-5. Others think Agrippa's first wife, Caecilia Attica, Reinhold, Marcus Agrippa (1933); Gaius Stern, Women, Children, and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae (Berk. diss. 2006). If the former (pace Syme, Severy, Abdale), she was both daughter of Agrippa and a great-niece to Augustus. But Varus would gain nothing going from one great-niece of Augustus to another of identical social standing, if this were so (Romans do not believe the death of a wife ended the relationship between affines). Varus became a personal friend to Marcus Agrippa and Tiberius. The historian Josephus says (in a section of his Antiquities whose manuscript tradition Walther John believed to be corrupt)John, Walther. \\"Zu den Familienh√§ltnissen des P. Quinctilius Varus\\", Hermes 86.2 (1958), pp. 251‚Äì255. that the son of Varus, also named \\"Publius Quinctilius Varus\\", served under him during his command in Syria.Joseph. AJ 17.288. If true, that son would have to be a son by a prior marriage and not the son by his last wife, Claudia Pulchra. See a full account of the debate in It is possible that this son might have instead been an older son, Sextus Nonius Quinctilianus, whom might have ended adopted by his sister‚Äôs husband after Varus and Vipsania died. That would explain why a son of Lucius Nonius Asprenas was named Quinctilianus, which implied adoption.Levick, p. 36 Vipsania disappears from history. It is unknown whether she died or was divorced. Varus married again to Claudia Pulchra.Tacitus, Annales 4.66.1. She was a daughter of Claudia Marcella Minor and the Roman consul of 12 BC, Marcus Valerius Messalla Appianus.Lightman, A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women, p. 205 Her maternal grandparents were the consul Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor and Octavia the Younger, sister of Augustus. Hence she was a grand-niece of Augustus.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p. 65 His marriage to Pulchra shows that Varus still enjoyed political favor. Pulchra bore Varus a son, also called Publius Quinctilius Varus. Through their son, they may have had further descendants. Political career As Lugdunum I (RIC 230), countermarked \\"VAR\\" (Varus). In 8‚Äì7 BC, Varus governed the province of Africa.Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (1986), 320. Later he went to govern Syria from 7/6 BC until 4 BC with four legions under his command, where he was known for his harsh rule and high taxes. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions the swift action of Varus against a messianic revolt in Judaea after the death of the Roman client king, Herod the Great, in 4 BC. After occupying Jerusalem, he crucified 2000 Jewish rebels and may have thus been one of the prime objects of popular anti-Roman sentiment in Judaea (Josephus, who made every effort to reconcile the Jewish people to Roman rule, felt it necessary to point out how lenient this judicial massacre had been). Indeed, at precisely this moment the Jews, nearly en masse, began a full-scale boycott of Roman pottery (Red Slip Ware).66 A.D. ‚Äì The Last Revolt (DVD). History Channel. Thus, the archaeological record seems to verify mass popular protest against Rome because of Varus' cruelty. Following the massacre in Judaea, Varus returned to Antioch.Josephus, Ant. 17.299 Between 10 BC and 6 AD Tiberius, his brother Drusus, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, and Germanicus conducted long campaigns in Germania, the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, in an attempt at achieving a further major expansion of the Roman Empire together with a shortening of its frontier line. They subdued several Germanic tribes, such as the Cherusci. In 6 AD, Tiberius declared Germany pacified, and Varus was appointed to govern Germania. Tiberius, who would later rule as Emperor, left the region to suppress the Great Illyrian Revolt. Augustus made Publius Quinctilius Varus the first \\"officially appointed\\" governor of the newly created Roman province of Germania in 7 AD. Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and death In September 9 AD Varus was preparing to leave his summer headquarters in Vetera (today Xanten) and march three legions ‚Äì the Seventeenth, the Eighteenth and the Nineteenth ‚Äì with him to Moguntiacum (modern-day Mainz), when news arrived from the Germanic prince Arminius (a Roman citizen and leader of an auxiliary cavalry unit) of a growing revolt in the Rhine area to the West. Ignoring a warning from Segestes not to trust Arminius, Varus marched his forces behind the latter's lead. Lithography showing Varus committing suicide during Teutoburg battle Not only was Varus' trust in Arminius a terrible misjudgement, but Varus compounded it by placing his legions in a position where their fighting strengths would be minimized and those of the Germanic tribesmen maximized ‚Äì because he expected no ambush and very little trouble in intimidating the rebels. Arminius and the Cherusci tribe along with other allies, had skillfully laid an ambush, and in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in September at Kalkriese (East of modern Osnabr√ºck), the Romans marched right into it. The heavily forested, swampy terrain made the infantry manoeuvres of the legions impossible to execute and allowed the Germans to defeat the legions in detail. On the third day of fighting, the Germans overwhelmed the Romans at Kalkriese Hill, north of Osnabr√ºck. Accounts of the defeat are scarce, due to the totality of the defeat, but Velleius Paterculus testifies that some Roman cavalrymen abandoned the infantry and fled towards the Rhine, but they were intercepted by the German tribesmen and killed.Velleius Paterculus, 2.118ff Varus himself, upon seeing all hope was lost, committed suicide.Velleius Paterculus, 2.119.3; Florus 2.30.38; Dio 56.21 Arminius cut off his head and sent it to Bohemia as a present to King Marbod of the Marcomanni, the other most important Germanic leader, whom Arminius wanted to coax into an alliance, but Marbod declined the offer and sent the head on to Rome for burial. Some captured Romans were caged and burned alive; others were enslaved or ransomed. Tacitus and Florus report that the victorious Germanic tribes tortured and sacrificed captive officers to their gods on altars that could still be seen years later.Tacitus Annales, 1.61; Florus 2.30.37-39 The Romans did later recover the lost legions' eagles, one each in 15 AD, 16 AD and 42 AD.Tacitus Annales, 1.60.4, 2.25.2; Dio 60.8.7 Aftermath Due to the shame and the ill luck thought created by the Roman defeat, the XVII, XVIII and XIX legions never again appeared in the Roman Army's order of battle. The loss at the Teutoburg Forest was keenly felt by Augustus in his remaining years. According to the biographer Suetonius, upon hearing the news, Augustus tore his clothes, refused to cut his hair for months and, for years afterwards, was heard, upon occasion, to moan, \\"Quinctilius Varus, give me back my Legions!\\" ().Suetonius, Vita Divi Augusti 23 ; Dio 55.23, see also Vell. Pat. 2.117-124; Suet. Div. Aug.49; Dio 55.18-24. Roman historians referred to the battle as the clades Variana (\\"Varian disaster\\").Seager, Tiberius, p.173 Gibbon describes Augustus' reaction to the defeat as one of the few times the normally stoic ruler lost his composure. Varus' political legacy in Rome was destroyed, and the government blamed him for the defeat.Suet. Tib.18.1; see also the Vell. Pat. 2.117. Both historians preserve \\"the official version\\" His son's (the younger Varus) chances for a political career were ruined. Tiberius himself fell under severe criticism for recommending Varus as the governor of Germania. Tiberius, according to Gaius Stern, was forced to sacrifice his friend and former brother-in-law to save his career.Gaius Stern, \\"Varus‚Äô Legacy After Teutoburger Wald: Roman POWs, Tiberius, and the Ara Pacis,\\" CAMWS 2009, Minneapolis, MN. Furthermore, Varus himself had been one of the figures on the Ara Pacis, but the figure is lost today. Stern has proposed that common citizens vandalized the Ara Pacis by damaging Varus in anger over their lost loved ones, leaving the regime, which had blamed Varus, uncertain as to whether or not to fix the damage. Approximately 40 years after Varus' death, a general under Claudius, Pomponius Secundus, raided Germany and by chance rescued a few POWs from Varus‚Äô army. Claudius welcomed them home after so many years, and their sad stories aroused much pity.Tac. Ann. 12.27.

It incorporates the theme of the horror of war. Style Like a traditional Petrarchan sonnet, the poem is divided into an octave and sestet. However, its rhyme scheme is neither that of a Petrarchan nor English sonnet, but irregular: ABABCDCD:EFFEGG. Even its indentations are irregular, not following its own rhyme scheme. Much of the second half of the poem is dedicated to funeral rituals suffered by those families deeply affected by the First World War. The poem does this by following the sorrow of common soldiers in some of the bloodiest battles, either the battle of the Somme, or the battle of Passchendaele, of the 20th century. Written between September and October 1917, when Owen was a patient at Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh recovering from shell shock, the poem is a lament for young soldiers whose lives were lost in the European War. The poem is also a comment on Owen's rejection of his religion in 1915. Composition While in the hospital, Owen met and became close friends with another poet, Siegfried Sassoon. Owen asked for his assistance in refining his poems' rough drafts. It was Sassoon who named the start of the poem \\"anthem\\", and who also substituted \\"dead\\", on the original article, with \\"doomed\\"; the famous epithet of \\"patient minds\\" is also a correction of his. The amended manuscript copy, in both men's handwriting, still exists and may be found at the Wilfred Owen Manuscript Archive on the world wide web. The revision process for the poem was fictionalized by Pat Barker in her novel Regeneration. Legacy The poem is among those set in the War Requiem of Benjamin Britten. During live performances of the song \\"Paschendale\\", Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson often recites the first half of the poem. The title of BBC WW1 drama The Passing Bells derives from the first line of the poem: \\"What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?\\" The third album by British band The Libertines is named Anthems For Doomed Youth, and features a song of the same name. American composer Stephen Whitehead included an orchestral setting of \\"Anthem for Doomed Youth\\" as a movement in his orchestral piece \\"Three Laments on the Great War\\" for soloists and orchestra. The piece is scored as a duet for mezzo-soprano and bass/baritone with orchestra.

It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution, the first being the National Assembly, the second being the Legislative Assembly, and the third being the Directory. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with Napoleon Bonaparte's coup d'√©tat, overthrowing the Directory, establishing the French Consulate, and ends during the Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (9 November 1799 ‚Äì 18 June 1815). The Congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the Convention. In 1804 Napoleon promulgated the Civil Code, a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example, by making women and children subservient to male heads of households. Whilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon also sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleon's armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognise French hegemony and continued the war throughout. The First French Empire began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to invade Russia. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleon's vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter Russian winter and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by an Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo.

Performers are paid either by the spectators or by the organisers of the show. A performance can include actual or simulated autoerotic acts or sexual activity with another performer. The performance can be in a theater style, or it can be in a peep show style. An increasingly popular form of sex show is a webcam performance in which the viewer is able to view and interact with webcam models in real time. Sex shows are distinguished from entertainment such as striptease, pole dancing or lap dance, which do not involve sexual activity other than undressing and dancing nude or semi-nude. Sexual activity at sex shows is also distinguished from regular prostitution in that the performers usually engage in sex acts only with other performers and not with spectators or paying customers. Sex shows can overlap with other sectors of the sex industry. For example, a strip club may also offer live sex performances, and a prostitute may offer to perform sex acts with another prostitute for the gratification of a patron. Locations In Havana, Cuba, in the 1950s, under the Batista regime, there were semi-legal sex shows and live pornographic theaters, such as the Shanghai Theater and the Tokyo Cabaret. The English novelist Graham Greene, writing in his autobiography Ways of Escape, described \\"the Shanghai Theatre where for one dollar and twenty- five cents one could see a nude cabaret of extreme obscenity with the bluest of blue films in the intervals\\". During the 1960s and 1970s the Laotian capital Vientiane was famous for sex shows at ping pong show bars during the Vietnam War. Travel writer Paul Theroux described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: ‚ÄúYour eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs.\\" British journalist Christopher Robbins wrote that The White Rose, a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls. In the Reeperbahn, the red-light district of Hamburg, several sex theatres (Salambo, Regina, Colibri, Safari) were once located in the ' (\\"Great Freedom\\") street. They showed live sex acts on stage, but by 2007 the Safari was the only live sex theatre left in Germany, and that closed in 2013. In the red light district of De Wallen in Amsterdam there are three main venues for sex shows: a hostess bar called the Bananen Bar, and the Moulin Rouge and Casa Rosso theatres, which feature on- stage sex acts and variations on the ping-pong show. In Thailand, locations like Patpong in Bangkok, Walking Street, Pattaya, Bangla Road in Phuket and Ta Pae Gate in Chiang Mai have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows. Legality Sex shows are subject to varying laws such as licensing requirements and locations are subject to local zoning regulations.E.g., in the United Kingdom, sex establishments require a Sex Establishment Licence from the City Council under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, and a premises licence under the Licensing Act 2003. Some jurisdictions regard a sex show as prostitution.news.com.au: Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows February 08, 2010 The content of a sex show may also be subject to national and local obscenity and other laws. Some areas allow striptease, but no sexual activity, others may allow only simulated sexual activity or autoerotic activity, while others allow anything that is legal in recorded pornography to be performed live. Generally, as of 2010, autoerotic activity is the most common legally-available kind of live sexual activity. In some cities and countries throughout the world, live sexual activity between multiple performers is legal. Webcam performances are largely unregulated.

It rises in the High Weald, Sussex and flows through Tonbridge, Maidstone and the Medway conurbation in Kent, before emptying into the Thames Estuary near Sheerness, a total distance of . About of the river lies in Sussex, with the remainder being in Kent. It has a catchment area of , the second largest in southern England after the Thames. The map opposite shows only the major tributaries: a more detailed mapMap of the Medway catchment area:The River Medway (and tributaries) shows the extensive network of smaller streams feeding into the main river. Those tributaries rise from points along the North Downs, the Weald and Ashdown Forest. Tributaries Dusk at Lower Upnor on the Medway Estuary The major tributaries are: * River Eden * River Bourne, known in the past as the Shode or Busty * River Teise, major sub-tributary River Bewl * River Beult * Loose Stream * River Len Minor tributaries include: * Wateringbury Stream * East Malling Stream *River Grom Former minor tributaries include the Old Bourne River, which flowed through the Brook, Chatham (not to be confused with the main tributary River Bourne). The river and its tributaries flow through largely rural areas, Tonbridge, Maidstone and Medway being the exceptions. The Medway itself initially flows in a west‚Äìeast direction south of the North Downs; at the confluence of the River Beult, however, it turns north and breaks through the North Downs at the Medway Gap, a steep and narrow valley near Rochester, before its final section to the sea. Until 1746 the river was not navigable above Maidstone. Below that point each village on the river had its wharf or wharves: at Halling, Snodland, New Hythe and Aylesford. Cargoes included corn, fodder, fruit, stone and timber. In 1746, improvements to the channel meant that barges of could reach East Farleigh, Yalding and even Tonbridge. In 1828, the channel was further improved up to Leigh. There are eleven locks on the river. The lowest, opened in 1792, is at Allington, and is the tidal limit. The others are at East Farleigh, Teston, Hampstead Lane, Stoneham Old Lock (disused), Sluice Weir Lock, Oak Weir Lock, East Lock, Porter's, Eldridge's and Town Lock in Tonbridge. The locks will take craft up to by , and vessels with a draft of can navigate the river. The shallowest point is just below Sluice Weir Lock, which is prone to silting after heavy rain.The Medway navigation, Leaflet, March 1991, NRA-National Rivers Authority Small craft such as canoes can sometimes travel as far as Penshurst. The stretch from Leigh to Allington is known as the Medway Navigation, and is in length. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority.  Estuary  Downstream of the Medway bridges (M2, HS1) the river comprises a sequence of tidal reaches:Ordnance Survey Explorer Map 163 Gravesend & Rochester (2015) * Wickham Reach * Tower Reach * Bridge Reach * Limehouse Reach * Chatham Reach * Upnor Reach * Short Reach * Gillingham Reach * Pinup Reach * Long Reach * Kethole Reach * Saltpan Reach River crossings Until recently the lowest public crossing of the Medway was at Rochester, where there has been a bridge since Roman times. In the 14th century the Wardens and Commonalty of Rochester Bridge were instituted by Sir John de Cobham to pay for the rebuilding and upkeep of the bridge. Until 1963 the nearest crossing to Rochester Bridge was the 14th-century bridge at Aylesford, upstream. Since then the following additional crossings have come into use: * 1963: A viaduct over the river was built south of Rochester to carry the first section of the M2 motorway. In 2003 this was widened to two separate spans. * Between 1963 and 1996 the M20 was built, with a bridge over the Medway south of Aylesford. * 1996: The Medway Tunnel became the river's lowest public crossing, connecting Gillingham to Strood. The four-lane tunnel was constructed using the immersed tube method, and was partially paid for by Rochester Bridge Trust, the successor to the Wardens and Commonalty. * 2003: A railway bridge long, with a central span of , was constructed for High Speed 1. The railway bridge lies parallel to the M2 motorway bridges. * 2017: A new road bridge from the A228 between Holborough and Halling across to Hall Road, Wouldham, to facilitate the development of Peters Village. Three other major crossings are at Tonbridge, where bridges carry the A227 road and a rail link over the river; there is also a two-span viaduct which takes the A21 over the Medway Valley near Haysden. The lowest crossing of the Medway are two cable tunnels between the Isle of Grain and Chetney marshes. These were built between 1973‚Äì6 in anticipation of the commissioning of Grain power station. The tunnels are 1700 m long, 2.54 m in diameter and between 34 and 47 m below ordnance datum; each carries a 400kV electricity circuit. There is no public access. Flooding The middle section of the Medway above Tonbridge, partly because of the various tributaries entering the river in this stretch ‚Äì in particular the River Eden ‚Äì has always been subject to extensive flooding. Tonbridge has suffered frequent flooding over the centuries, so much so that the higher part of the town to the north is called \\"Dryhill\\". Flood protection measures have therefore been taken. In 1981, a flood barrier was constructed downstream from Leigh to protect Tonbridge, which had been severely affected by the flooding of 1968. During periods of high flow, the flow is controlled by impounding the water and allowing up to of farmland upstream of the barrier to flood. However, this did not prevent significant flooding in Tonbridge in winter 2013‚Äì14. In recent years the village of Yalding, about 12 km downstream at the confluence with the River Beult, has been more prone to flooding than Tonbridge. Footpaths The Medway Valley Walk follows the river from Rochester to Tonbridge along the bank most of the way above Allington. It starts on the Saxon Shore Way at Rochester. The North Downs Way crosses the river using the Medway Viaduct or motorway bridge. The Greensand Way crosses the river at Yalding. At West Peckham, it is joined by the Wealdway which continues through Tonbridge, thus linking with the Eden Valley Walk. Maidstone Millennium River Park is a walk from Teston Country Park to the Museum of Kent Life at Sandling. The park, built between 1998 and 2001, has transformed of wasteland and three new footbridges have been built over the river. History Ancient sites abound throughout the length of the River Medway. The area around Aylesford is a notable Stone Age site where the Medway megaliths are a group of Neolithic chamber tombs including the Coldrum Stones and Kit's Coty House. Bronze Age ornaments and beakers have been found along the river; other burial sites and finds come from the pre-Roman Iron Age. The Romans left evidence of many villas in the lower Medway Valley; later Jutish burial sites have also been found.Kent History Illustrated Frank W Jessup 1966 Kent County Council The Domesday Book records many manors in the Medway valley. Castles became a feature of the landscape, including Rochester, Allington, Leeds (near Maidstone), and West Malling. Two military actions are named after the river: the Battle of the Medway (43 CE, during the Roman invasion of Britain); and the Raid on the Medway, in 1667 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In the 18th century Samuel Ireland published an illustrated book about a journey up the river, to the River Bewl at Bayham Abbey. The book's map shows some of the tributaries (unnamed). The illustrations include the castles at Queenborough, Upnor, Leybourne, Tonbridge and Hever; Penshurst Place; and the bridges at Teston, Maidstone, Aylesford, East Farleigh, Barming, Branbridges and Tonbridge. The hop fields in the vicinity of the latter are also described; and the easterly River Len, which then supplied Maidstone with its piped water. The book states that Within about two miles of Tunbridge the Medway branches out into several small streams, five of which unite at the town ... having each its stone bridge. The Thames and Medway Canal, duplicatively linking the estuary at Strood to Gravesend for adverse tides and weather was completed in 1824 -- not a commercial success: by 1849 the South Eastern Railway had taken over its tunnel through a hillside. The western part of the canal remained in use until 1934. Frindsbury Church above the former entrance to the Thames and Medway Canal The Hartlake disaster of 1853 saw the deaths of 30 hop-pickers when a wagon carrying them crashed through the side of a rotten wooden bridge at Golden Green near Hadlow, throwing its passengers into the flood-swollen river. In 1914 HMS Bulwark exploded while moored at Kethole Reach near Sheerness, killing 741 men with only 12 survivors. In 1942 the world's first test of a submarine oil pipeline was conducted one laid across the Medway in Operation Pluto. Culture The Medway's 'marriage' to the Thames is given extensive treatment by Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in the 16th century (Book IV, Canto xi). Joseph Conrad describes the view up the Medway from the Thames Estuary in The Mirror of the Sea (1906). For the 1999 film The Mummy the river was filmed at Chatham Dockyard, in an imitation of a \\"port at Cairo\\". The scene is brief but involves the main protagonists departing on their mission to the city of the dead. Every year a festival is held in Maidstone to celebrate the River Medway. Maidstone River Festival, which has been running since 1980, is held on the last Saturday of July. It features events on and around the river and attracts thousands to Kent's county town. The festival was cancelled in 2012 due to the London Olympics, but returned in 2013. However, the 2013 event did not include a funfair or a fireworks display as in previous years, and lasted just one day instead of two. Medway Flows Softly is a song by local man George Gilbert; it was written in the mid 1960s and is often played in local folk clubs and at festivals in Kent. The River Medway is featured at Maidstone in the studio backdrop of the ITV1 regional news programme Meridian Tonight. At 7.15 p.m. on 1 May each year, local Morris dancers Kettle Bridge Clogs dance across Barming Bridge (otherwise known as the Kettle Bridge) to mark the start of their Morris dancing season. Recreationally the river is used by many. For example, individuals and many clubs have paddling trips along many different parts of the Medway (e.g. Bewl Canoe Club). Individuals and club members paddling on the Medway and most other rivers should be members of British Canoeing. =\\"Kentish Men\\" and \\"Men of Kent\\"= Kent coat of arms The Medway is said to divide the county of Kent into two parts: this may allude to the two dioceses into which Kent has been divided since the year 604: Canterbury and Rochester. The tradition has grown up, and is kept alive by the \\"Association of Men of Kent and Kentish Men\\", that those born in West Kent ‚Äì the area north of the river, but including Maidstone, Gillingham (other than Rainham), Rochester and Chatham ‚Äì are labelled Kentish Men (or Maids); while those born in East Kent are Men (or Maids) of Kent. This labelling applies equally to those born in those parts of the traditional county absorbed into London since the 1880s. Watermills The power of the Medway has been harnessed for a millennium or more. Waterwheels and turbines powered by the waters of the Medway and its tributaries have been used to mill corn, make paper, make cloth, smelt iron, pump water and generate electricity. There are over 200 sites on the Medway where such usage is known. Today, only one mill is working for a commercial trade. See Medway watermills, and Medway watermills on the upper tributaries, the middle tributaries and the lower tributaries for more details.

Pinker argues that humans are born with an innate capacity for language. He deals sympathetically with Noam Chomsky's claim that all human language shows evidence of a universal grammar, but dissents from Chomsky's skepticism that evolutionary theory can explain the human language instinct. Thesis Pinker criticizes a number of common ideas about language, for example that children must be taught to use it, that most people's grammar is poor, that the quality of language is steadily declining, that the kind of linguistic facilities that a language provides (for example, some languages have words to describe light and dark, but no words for colors) has a heavy influence on a person's possible range of thoughts (the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis), and that nonhuman animals have been taught language (see Great ape language). Pinker sees language as an ability unique to humans, produced by evolution to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He compares language to other species' specialized adaptations such as spiders' web-weaving or beavers' dam-building behavior, calling all three \\"instincts\\". By calling language an instinct, Pinker means that it is not a human invention in the sense that metalworking and even writing are. While only some human cultures possess these technologies, all cultures possess language. As further evidence for the universality of language, Pinker--mainly relying on the work of Derek Bickerton--notes that children spontaneously invent a consistent grammatical speech (a creole) even if they grow up among a mixed-culture population speaking an informal trade pidgin with no consistent rules. Deaf babies \\"babble\\" with their hands as others normally do with voice, and spontaneously invent sign languages with true grammar rather than a crude \\"me Tarzan, you Jane\\" pointing system. Language (speech) also develops in the absence of formal instruction or active attempts by parents to correct children's grammar. These signs suggest that rather than being a human invention, language is an innate human ability. Pinker also distinguishes language from humans' general reasoning ability, emphasizing that it is not simply a mark of advanced intelligence but rather a specialized \\"mental module\\". He distinguishes the linguist's notion of grammar, such as the placement of adjectives, from formal rules such as those in the American English writing style guide. He argues that because rules like \\"a preposition is not a proper word to end a sentence with\\" must be explicitly taught, they are irrelevant to actual communication and should be ignored. Pinker attempts to trace the outlines of the language instinct by citing his own studies of language acquisition in children, and the works of many other linguists and psychologists in multiple fields, as well as numerous examples from popular culture. He notes, for instance, that specific types of brain damage cause specific impairments of language such as Broca's aphasia or Wernicke's aphasia, that specific types of grammatical construction are especially hard to understand, and that there seems to be a critical period in childhood for language development just as there is a critical period for vision development in cats. Much of the book refers to Chomsky's concept of a universal grammar, a meta-grammar into which all human languages fit. Pinker explains that a universal grammar represents specific structures in the human brain that recognize the general rules of other humans' speech, such as whether the local language places adjectives before or after nouns, and begin a specialized and very rapid learning process not explainable as reasoning from first principles or pure logic. This learning machinery exists only during a specific critical period of childhood and is then disassembled for thrift, freeing resources in an energy-hungry brain. Reception Pinker's assumptions about the innateness of language have been challenged by some; English linguist Geoffrey Sampson has contested some of the claims made in the book about this.Geoffrey Sampson: The ‚ÄòLanguage Instinct‚Äô Debate. Richard Webster, writes in Why Freud Was Wrong (1995), and concludes that Pinker argues cogently that the human capacity for language is part of the genetic endowment associated with the evolution through natural selection of specialised neural networks within the brain, and that its attack on the 'standard social science model' of human nature is effective. Webster accepts Pinker's argument that, for ideological motives, twentieth-century social scientists have minimized the extent to which human nature is influenced by genetics. However, Webster finds Pinker's speculation about other specialized neural networks that may have evolved within the human brain‚Äîsuch as \\"intuitive mechanics\\" and \\"intuitive biology\\"‚Äîto be questionable, and believes that there is a danger that they will be treated by others as science. Webster believes that such speculations strengthen supporters of extreme genetic determinism.

The play has only two characters: Owen and Sassoon. The story of their friendship is told in a series of flashbacks, narrated by Sassoon who survived World War I (in which Owen was killed). Most of the scenes take place during their time as fellow-patients at Craiglockhart War Hospital near Edinburgh in 1917. The title is a quotation from the preface Wilfred Owen wrote in preparation for the publication of his collected poems: Synopsis The action is replayed through the eyes of an older Siegfried Sassoon, as he recalls his relationship with Wilfred Owen, beginning some fourteen years earlier.\\"Not About Heroes\\", Geoffrey Whitworth Theatre. Owen introduces himself hesitantly to Sassoon when the latter arrives at Craiglockhart in 1917, having been diagnosed as suffering from \\"war neurosis\\" as a result of his protest against the war. The course of their friendship is shown through extracts from the real diaries and letters of the two men, right up to their last meeting at the Chelsea Physic Garden, when Sassoon was recovering from a head wound that would end his military career while Owen waited to return to the Western Front, where he would be killed shortly afterwards. Past productions Not About Heroes had its premi√®re at the Edinburgh Festival in 1982 and won a Fringe First award. Directed by Eric Standidge, Sassoon was played by the author and Owen by David Learner. It toured and came to the King's Head, was adapted for Yorkshire TV and BBC Radio 4, and was published by Faber and Faber, all in 1983. A new production at the Royal National Theatre in 1986 celebrated the centenary of Sassoon's birth. A national tour took place the following year with Paul Shelley as Siegfried Sassoon and Stephen McGann as Wilfred Owen. In 1992, the author directed a revised text for the Citizen's, Glasgow - a production which afterwards was seen in Shrewsbury as part of the celebrations marking the centenary of Owen's birth. A production by Dianne Wiest at the Williamstown Theatre Festival transferred to New York City in 1985. Edward Herrmann and Dylan Baker both won OBIE awards. The 1987 Stratford Ontario production, with Nicholas Pennell and Henry Czerny, was revived the following year. Not About Heroes was also performed in the early 1990s at The Round House Theatre in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. Stephen McGann played Owen in a production at the Oxford Playhouse in 1987, opposite Paul Shelley as Sassoon.McGann Brothers Jonas Armstrong played Owen in a 2000 production at the Edinburgh Fringe. In October/November 2008, Rowan Tree Theatre Co. in the Scottish Borders, mounted a production of the play to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of the Great War and in celebration of the company's twenty-first birthday. One performance was given in Craiglockhart Hospital, the site of the actual meeting of the two poets. Sassoon was played by Oliver Bisset, and Owen by Matthew Burgess. The play was directed by John Haswell and produced by Judy Steel. Notable productions of Not About Heroes in recent years have included a version mounted for the 2002 Hay-on-Wye literary festival, starring Roger Moss and Owen Sheers. It was directed by Cathy Gill and produced by the novelist, Louis de Berni√®res. The following year, Peter Dickson and Andrew Butterworth starred in a production at the Crescent Theatre, Birmingham. In 2005 MADHouse Productions staged a poignant version in the intimate surroundings of the Barons Court Theatre in west London. This production starred Dov Citron as Sassoon and Martin Scully as Owen and was directed by Ian Flintoff. In 2006, Feelgood Theatre Productions premiered a site specific production in the setting of the Imperial War Museum North starring Dan Willis and Sam Ellis. Directed by Caroline Clegg, this production went on to be the first theatre company to perform in the Cabinet War Rooms (Churchill's bunker), followed by a national tour and short sell-out season at Trafalgar Studios, Whitehall, London. Inspired by Not About Heroes at Trafalgar Feelgood created Eloquent Protest a peace event using poetry, song and textas \\"an artists response to war\\".

Development of the Ju 52 commenced during 1930, headed by German aeronautical engineer Ernst Zindel. The aircraft's design incorporated a corrugated duralumin metal skin as a strengthening measure, which was very unusual at the time. The Ju 52's maiden flight was performed on 13 October 1930. It was initially designed with a single engine, however, it was produced in quantity as a trimotor. The primary early production model, the Ju 52/3m, was principally operated as a 17-seat airliner or utility transport aircraft by various civil operators during the 1930s. Following the rise of Nazi Germany, thousands of Ju 52s were procured as a staple military transport of the nation. The Ju 52/3mg7e was the principal production model. The Ju 52 was in production between 1931 and 1952. In a civilian role, it flew with over 12 airlines, including Swissair and Deutsche Luft Hansa, as both a passenger carrier and a freight hauler. In a military role, large numbers flew with the Luftwaffe, being deployed on virtually all fronts of the Second World War as a troop and cargo transport; it was also briefly used as a medium bomber. Additionally, the type was deployed by other nation's militaries in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War, the Chaco War, and the Portuguese Colonial War. During the postwar era, the Ju 52 had a lengthy service life with numerous military and civilian operators; large numbers were still in use by the 1980s. Even in the 21st century, several aircraft have remained operational, typically used for purposes such as heritage aviation displays and aerial sightseeing. Development The Ju 52 was similar to the company's previous Junkers W 33, although larger. In 1930, German aeronautical engineer Ernst Zindel and his team designed the Ju 52 at the Junkers works at Dessau. According to aviation author J. Richard Smith, the Ju 52 directly drew upon the company's First World War-era Junkers J 1 - the world's first all-metal aeroplane.Smith 1966, p. 3. On 13 October 1930, the first prototype, designated Ju 52ba, performed the type's maiden flight; it was initially powered by a single Junkers-built liquid-cooled V-12 engine, capable of generating up to 800 hp. During the aircraft's extensive trials, it was reengined with a 755 hp BMW IV powerplant. The second prototype, designated Ju 52de, featured an increased wing span and was powered by the BMW IV engine at first; it was soon reengined with the 750 hp Armstrong Siddeley Leopard and re-designated Ju 52di. Later on, the Ju 52di was again reengined with the 750 hp Junkers Jumo 204, after which it was re-designated Ju 52do. The third prototype, designated Ju 52ce, had a strengthened structure, a modified leading edge, and was fitted with both a wheeled and float undercarriages. During May 1931, one of the prototypes, designated Ju 52cai, was written off after a crash.Smith 1966, pp. 3-4. While these initial aircraft had been powered by a single engine, Junkers decided to develop the Ju 52 into a trimotor configuration. Accordingly, the Ju 52/3m (drei motoren‚Äî\\"three engines\\") was developed, being powered by an arrangement of three radial engines. According to Smith, the earliest known Ju 52/3m was delivered to Bolivian airline Lloyd A√©reo Boliviano during 1932. During its initial production years, airlines were the type's most common customers. By the mid-1930s, the Ju 52/3mce and Ju 52/3fe, were the two primary production variants, both being powered by the BMW 132 radial engine.Smith 1966, p. 4. During 1934, work commenced on a militarised model of the Ju 52/3m, designated Ju 52/3mg3e, on behalf of the then-secret Luftwaffe. This model could function as a medium bomber, being furnished with a pair of defensive gun turrets and operated by a crew of four. Between 1934 and 1935, a total of 450 Ju 52/3mg3e aircraft were delivered to the Luftwaffe. Numerous improved models would be introduced prior to and during the Second World War. The dominant production model was the Ju 52/3mg7e, featuring advances such as an autopilot, enlarged doors to the cabin, and other general enhancements. It was configured as a pure transport aircraft, being capable of carrying up to 18 fully-equipped troops. Defensive armaments comprised a dorsal-mounted 13 mm MG 131 machine gun and a pair of sideways-mounted 7.9mm MG 15 machine guns.Smith 1966, p. 6. Successive models saw other improvements, such as revised glazing, newer engines, undercarriage strengthening, and increased take-off weight. The final wartime model to be developed, designated Ju 52/3mg14e, featured improved armour protection for the pilot and a bolstered defensive armament.Smith 1966, pp. 6-7. From mid-1943 onwards, the Luftwaffe began to make less use of the Ju 52, interest having waned in the type. German officials were interested in procuring a successor to the type; at one stage, the Reich Air Ministry showed enthusiasm for the Junkers Ju 352, a larger transport aircraft somewhat resembling the Ju 52. Actions were taken to convert Junkers' Ju 52 production lines to instead manufacture Ju 352s; however, the conflict's end in May 1945 led to the effort being abandoned in an unfinished state.Smith 1966, p. 13. As such, German production of the Ju 52 was terminated during 1944; Smith claims that a total of 3,234 aircraft of various models were constructed during the conflict.Smith 1966, p. 7. In the postwar era, manufacture of the Ju 52 resumed, albeit in foreign countries. It was constructed in France by Avions Amiot as the Amiot AAC.1 Toucan; it was also produced in Spain by Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) as the CASA 352. A handful of captured wartime aircraft were also rebuilt by Short Brothers of Northern Ireland for civilian service.

It was formed around four pairs of circular cross-section duralumin spars with a corrugated surface that provided torsional stiffening. A narrow control surface, with its outer section functioning as the aileron, and the inner section functioning as a flap, ran along the whole trailing edge of each wing panel, well separated from it. The inner flap section lowered the stalling speed and the arrangement became known as the Doppelfl√ºgel, or \\"double wing\\".Jackson 1960, p. 100. The outer sections of this operated differentially as ailerons, projecting slightly beyond the wingtips with control horns. The strutted horizontal stabilizer carried horn-balanced elevators which again projected and showed a significant gap between them and the stabilizer, which was adjustable in-flight. All stabilizer surfaces were corrugated. Junkers Ju 52 The Ju 52 featured an unusual corrugated duralumin metal skin, which had been pioneered by Junkers during the First World War; the corrugation served to strengthen the whole structure over a smoother approach. The fuselage was of rectangular section with a domed decking, comprising a tubular steel structure that was entirely covered by the corrugated metal skin. A port-side passenger door was placed just aft of the wings; this entrance also acted as a loading hatch for freight, the lower half functioning as a platform to ease cargo movements. The cabin had a dimensional capacity of 590 cubic feet, and was lined with numerous windows stretching forward to the pilots' cockpit. The main undercarriage was fixed and divided; some aircraft had wheel fairings, others did not. A fixed tailskid, or a later tailwheel, was used. Some aircraft were fitted with floats or skis instead of the main wheels. In its original configuration, designated the Ju 52/1m, the Ju 52 was a single-engined aircraft, powered by either a BMW IV or Junkers liquid-cooled V-12 engine. However, the single-engined model was deemed to been underpowered and, after seven prototypes had been completed, all subsequent Ju 52s were built with three radial engines as the Ju 52/3m (drei motoren‚Äî\\"three engines\\"). Originally powered by three Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, later production models mainly received 574 kW (770 hp) BMW 132 engines, a licence-built refinement of the Pratt & Whitney design. Export models were also built with 447 kW (600 hp) Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp and 578 kW (775 hp) Bristol Pegasus VI engines. The two wing-mounted radial engines of the Ju 52/3m had half-chord cowlings and in planform view (from above/below) appeared to be splayed outwards, being mounted at an almost perpendicular angle to the tapered wing's sweptback leading edge (in a similar fashion to the Mitsubishi G3M bomber and Short Sunderland; the angled engines on the Ju 52 were intended to make maintaining straight flight easier should an engine fail, while the others had different reasons). The three engines had either Townend ring or NACA cowlings to reduce drag from the engine cylinders, although a mixture of the two was most common (as can be seen in many of the accompanying photographs), with deeper-chord NACA cowlings on the wing engines and a narrow Townend ring on the center engine (onto which a deeper NACA cowl was more difficult to fit, due to the widening fuselage behind the engine). Production Ju 52/3m aircraft flown by Deutsche Luft Hansa before the Second World War, as well as Luftwaffe-flown Ju 52s flown during the war, usually used an air-start system to turn over their trio of radial engines, using a common compressed air supply that also operated the main wheels' brakes. In a military context, the Ju 52 could carry up to 18 fully-equipped soldiers, or 12 stretchers when used as an air ambulance. Transported material was loaded and unloaded through side doors by means of a ramp. Air-dropped supplies were jettisoned through two double chutes; supply containers were dropped by parachute through the bomb-bay doors, and paratroopers jumped through the side doors. Sd.Kfz. 2 Kettenkraftr√§der (half-track motorcycles) and supply canisters for parachute troops were secured under the fuselage at the bomb bay exits and were dropped with four parachutes. A tow coupling was built into the tail-skid for use in towing freight gliders. The Ju 52 could tow up to two DFS 230 gliders.

Richardson's Canadian Airways received (Werknummer 4006) CF-ARM, the sixth-built Ju 52/1m. The aircraft, first refitted with an Armstrong Siddeley Leopard radial engine and then later with a Rolls-Royce Buzzard and nicknamed the \\"Flying Boxcar\\" in Canada,\\"'Bud' Johnston Library.\\" Rolls-Royce of Canada Ltd., Montreal Quebec.\\"Flying Box Car for Sky Lanes Of Northland.\\" Popular Mechanics, May 1939. could lift about 3 tons and had a maximum weight of 7 tonnes (8 tons). It was commonly used to supply mining and other operations in remote areas with equipment that was too big and heavy for other aircraft then in use. The Ju 52/1m was able to land on wheels, skis, or floats (as were all Ju 52 variants).\\"Junkers_Ju-52/1m .\\" scramble.nl. Retrieved: 12 October 2010. Prior to the Nazi government's seizure of control of the Junkers company during 1935, the Ju 52/3m was produced principally as a 17-seat airliner. By 1935, 97 Ju 52s were being operated by numerous airlines; early customers included Finland's Aero O/Y, Sweden's AB Aerotransport, and Brazil's Syndicato Condor. During May 1932, German flag carrier Luft Hansa took delivery of its first example of the type. The Ju 52 was heavily used by Luft Hansa, it was able to fly from Berlin to Rome in eight hours; both this route and the London-Berlin service was frequently operated by the type. According to Smith, Luft Hansa's Ju 52 fleet eventually numbered 231 Ju 52s;Smith 1966, p. 5. during the pre-war era, it was flown on various routes from Germany on routes in Europe, Asia, and South America. =Military use 1932‚Äì1945= The Colombian Air Force used three Ju 52/3mde bombers equipped as floatplanes during the Colombia-Peru War in 1932‚Äì1933. After the war, the air force acquired three other Ju 52mge as transports; the type remained in service until after the end of the Second World War. Bolivia acquired four Ju 52s in the course of the Chaco War (1932‚Äì1935), mainly for medical evacuation and air supply. During the conflict, the Ju 52s alone transported more than 4,400 tons of cargo to the front.Hagedorn, Dan & Antonio Luis Sapienza. (1996) \\"Aircraft of the Chaco War, 1928‚Äì1935.\\" Schiffer Publishing Co. Atglen, pp. 96‚Äì100. . In 1934, Junkers received orders to produce a bomber version of the Ju 52/3m to serve as interim equipment for the bomber units of the still-secret Luftwaffe until it could be replaced by the purpose-designed Dornier Do 11.Green 1972, p. 405. Two bomb bays were fitted, capable of holding up to of bombs, while defensive armament consisted of two 7.92 mm MG 15 machine guns, one in an open dorsal position, and one in a retractable \\"dustbin\\" ventral position, which could be manually winched down from the fuselage to protect the aircraft from attacks from below. The bomber could be easily converted to serve in the transport role.Green 1972, p. 406. The Dornier Do 11 was a failure, however, and the Junkers ended up being acquired in much larger numbers than at first expected, with the type being the Luftwaffe's main bomber until more modern aircraft such as the Heinkel He 111, Junkers Ju 86 and Dornier Do 17 entered into service.Green 1972, pp. 405‚Äì406.Smith and Kay 1972, p. 360. The Ju 52 first was used in military service in the Spanish Civil War against the Spanish Republic. It was one of the first aircraft to be delivered to the Nationalist faction in July 1936. According to Smith, the Ju 52 gained a formidable reputation; the type having been reportedly used in practically every major military engagement in support of Nationalist forces. In the Spanish theatre, the Ju 52 was operated both as a bomber and as a transport. In the former role, it participated in the bombing of Guernica, although it was considered obsolete as a bomber by late 1937, by which point it was in the process of being replaced by more capable bombers such as the Dornier Do 17 and Heinkel He 111.Smith 1966, pp. 5-6. The type's final sortie in the theatre was performed on 26 March 1939. By the end of the conflict, Ju 52s had accumulated 13,000 operational hours and had performed 5,400 offensive missions and dropped over 6,000 bombs.Smith 1966, p. 6. Following the end of the Spanish Civil War, no further aircraft of the bomber variants were built, though the type was again used as a bomber during the bombing of Warsaw\\"Warsaw.\\" richmond.edu. Retrieved: 12 October 2010. during the invasion of Poland in September 1939. The Luftwaffe instead relied on the Ju 52 for transport roles during the Second World War, including paratroop drops. =Second World War= During its service with Luft Hansa, the Ju 52 had proved to be an extremely reliable passenger airplane. This positive experience contributed to its adoption by the Luftwaffe as a standard aircraft model. In 1938, the 7th Air Division had five air transport groups with 250 Ju 52s. The Luftwaffe had 552 Ju 52s at the start of the Second World War. Though it was built in great numbers, the Ju 52 was technically obsolete. Between 1939 and 1944, 2,804 Ju 52s were delivered to the Luftwaffe (1939: 145; 1940: 388; 1941: 502; 1942: 503; 1943: 887; and 1944: 379). The production of Ju 52s continued until around the summer of 1944; when the war came to an end, 100 to 200 were still available. Lightly armed, and with a top speed of only 265 km/h (165 mph) ‚Äì half that of a contemporary Hurricane ‚Äì the Ju 52 was very vulnerable to fighter attack, and an escort was always necessary when flying in a combat zone. Many Ju 52's were shot down by antiaircraft guns and fighters while transporting supplies, most notably during the desperate attempt to resupply the trapped German Sixth Army during the final stages of the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942‚Äì1943.Smith 1966, pp. 11-12. From 24 November 1942 to 31 January 1943, 488 aircraft were recorded as lost (this number included 266 Ju 52, 165 He 111, 42 Ju 86, 9 Fw 200, 5 He 177 and 1 Ju 290) and about 1,000 flight personnel.Morzik F. \\"German Air Force Airlift Operations.\\" USAAF Historical division, 1961. p. 195. Denmark and Norway campaign The first major operation for the aircraft after the bombing of Warsaw was in Operation Weser√ºbung, the attack on Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940. Fifty- two Ju 52s from 1. and 8. Staffel in Kampfgeschwader 1 transported a company of Fallschirmj√§ger (paratroopers) and a battalion of infantry to the northern part of Jutland, and captured the airfield at Aalborg, vital to support the operation in southern Norway. Several hundred Ju 52s were also used to transport troops to Norway in the first days of this campaign.Smith 1966, pp. 7, 10. During the Norwegian campaign, the Luftwaffe's Ju 52s performed a total of 3,018 sorties, 1830 of which had been carrying troops while the remainder transported cargo and various supplies. According to Smith, 29,280 personnel, 2,376 tons of supplies and 259,300 imp. gallons of fuel had been airlifted by Ju 52s through the campaign. Around 150 aircraft had been recorded as lost by the end of operations.Smith 1966, p. 10. A minesweeper Ju 52/3m MS (Minensuch) equipped with degaussing ring The seaplane version, equipped with two large floats, served during the Norwegian campaign in 1940, and later in the Mediterranean theatre. Some Ju 52's, both floatplanes and landplanes, were also used as minesweepers, known as Minensuch ‚Äî literally, \\"mine-search\\" aircraft in German ‚Äî and fitted with a diameter current-carrying degaussing ring under the airframe to create a magnetic field that triggered submerged naval mines. These aircraft were usually given an -\\"MS\\" suffix to designate them, as had been done with the similarly equipped Bv 138 MS trimotor flying boat.The Aeroplane Monthly, June 1994, p. 28. Netherlands campaign The Ju 52 transport aircraft participated in the attack on the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. It was during this campaign that the Ju 52 performed a crucial role in carrying out the first large-scale air attack with paratroops in history during the Battle for The Hague. According to Smith, 500 Ju 52s had been made ready for the aerial assault on the Low Countries. In addition to the paratroop drops, they also directly landed in hostile territory to deploy assault troops, such as at Ypenburg Airport, on public highways around The Hague, and on the River Meuse (the latter using float-equipped aircraft).Smith 1966, pp. 10-11. During the opening days of the Netherlands campaign, many German aircraft were shot down by Dutch AA-fire; a total of 125 Ju 52s were lost and 47 damaged; author Hooton considered these losses to have been relatively costly for the Luftwaffe.E.R Hooton. \\"Luftwaffe at War: Blitzkrieg in the West.\\" 2007, Vol. 2, p. 50. Although transport operations with the Ju 52 were noticeably curtailed after the initial days of the invasion, the type continued to aerially supply forward ground troops.Smith 1966, p. 11. During August 1940, Nazi German decided to base large numbers of Ju 52s at airfields in the Lyon, Lille, and Arras areas.Page 50, \\"German Air Force Air Lift Operations\\", by GeneralMajor Fritz Morzik, USAF Historical Division, 1961. Luftwaffe transport units were deliberately held at a state of readiness for Operation Sea Lion, the envisioned invasion of the British Isles; however,this operation was never attempted, in part due to the Luftwaffe being unable to secure aerial supremacy during the Battle of Britain. A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad, 1942 Balkans campaign The next major use of the Ju 52 was in the Balkans campaign. The type has been credited with enabling the rapid deployment of German ground forces throughout the theatre. However, the Ju 52 was perhaps most famously deployed during the Battle of Crete in late May 1941. 493 Ju 52/3m aircraft were used to transport much of the 22,750 troops flown onto Crete for the Luftwaffe's largest airborne invasion of the war. While victorious, 170 aircraft were lost along with 4,500 personnel; the high loss rate brought about the end of German paratroop operations. North Africa campaign During the North African campaign, the Ju 52 was the mainstay reinforcement and resupply transport for the Germans, starting with 20 to 50 flights a day to Tunisia from Sicily in November 1942, building to 150 landings a day in early April as the Axis situation became more desperate. The Allied air forces developed a counter-air operation over a two-month period and implemented Operation Flax on 5 April 1943, destroying 11 Ju 52s in the air near Cap Bon and many more during bombing attacks on its Sicilian airfields, leaving only 29 flyable.Craven and Cate 1949, pp. 189‚Äì190 That began two catastrophic weeks in which more than 140 aircraft were lost in air interceptions,Craven and Cate 1949, pp. 190‚Äì191 culminating on 18 April with the \\"Palm Sunday Massacre\\" in which 24 Ju 52s were shot down, and another 35 staggered back to Sicily and crash-landed.Weal 2003, p. 91.Smith 1966, p. 12. =Hitler's personal transport= Hitler used a Deutsche Luft Hansa Ju 52 for campaigning in the 1932 German election, preferring flying to train travel. After he became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Hans Baur became his personal pilot, and Hitler was provided with a personal Ju 52. Named Immelmann II after the First World War ace Max Immelmann, it carried the registration D-2600.Hoffmann 2000, p. 75. As his power and importance grew, Hitler's personal air force grew to nearly 50 aircraft, based at Berlin Tempelhof Airport and made up mainly of Ju 52s, which also flew other members of his cabinet and war staff. In September 1939, at Baur's suggestion, Immelmann II was replaced by a four-engine Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor, although Immelman II remained his backup aircraft for the rest of the Second World War. =Chiang Kai-shek's personal transport= A Ju 52 of Eurasia, 1930s in China Eurasia was the main Chinese Airliner Company in the 1930s and the Ju 52 was their main airliner plane. One of them was commandeered by the Chinese Nationalist Party government and became Chiang Kai-shek's personal transport. =Postwar use= Flugplatz Albstadt-Degerfeld airfield (2016) Ju 52/3m of British European Airways in 1947 French-built AAC.1 of STA at Manchester Airport in 1948: This aircraft is preserved in Belgrade. Howard Field, Panama Canal Zone, late 1942 with the USAAF 20th Transportation Squadron, Sixth Air Force. Various Junkers Ju 52s continued in military and civilian use following World War II. In 1956, the Portuguese Air Force, which was already using the Ju 52s as a transport plane, employed the type as a paratroop drop aircraft for its newly organized elite parachute forces, later known as the Batalh√£o de Ca√ßadores P√°raquedistas. The paratroopers used the Ju 52 in several combat operations in Angola and other Portuguese African colonies before gradually phasing it out of service in the 1960s.Afonso and Gomes 2000, pp. 178‚Äì183. The Swiss Air Force also operated the Ju 52 from 1939 to 1982, when three aircraft remained in operation, probably the last and longest service in any air force.airforce history \\"Ju-52.\\"Swiss Air Force History.

Retrieved: 4 November 2010. Some military Ju 52s were converted to civilian use. For example, British European Airways operated 11 ex-Luftwaffe Ju 52/3mg8e machines, taken over by the RAF, between 1946 and retirement in 1947 on intra-U.K. routes before the Douglas DC-3 was introduced to the airline. French airlines such as Societe de Transports Aeriens (STA) and Air France flew Toucans in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In the USSR, captured Ju 52s were allocated to the Civil Air Fleet, being found particularly suitable for transporting sulphur from the Karakum Desert.^ Kotelnikov, V. Stalin's Captives article in Fly Past magazine, February 2017 p.103 with ground load photo Various Soviet agencies used the Ju 52 through to 1950.

The town is on the south bank of the River Tees and is historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire. The bridge at Yarm marked the furthest reach of tidal flow up the River Tees until the opening, in 1995, of the Tees Barrage, which now regulates river flow above Stockton. As the last bridge on the river before the sea, it was superseded by a new toll bridge opened in Stockton in 1771. The oldest part of the town, around the High Street, is situated in a loop of the river, and the newer parts of the town extend to the point where the River Leven meets the River Tees. For local government administration purposes the town is within the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees. History The name of the town is thought to be derived from the Old English gearum, dative plural of gear, 'pool for catching fish' (source of the modern dialect word yair with the same meaning), hence 'at the place of the fish pools'. Yarm was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was originally a chapelry in the Kirklevington parish in the North Riding of Yorkshire; it later became a parish in its own right. Dominican Friars settled in Yarm about 1286, and maintained a friary and a hospital in the town, until 1583. Their memory is preserved in the names of Friarage and Spital Bank. The Friarage was built on top of the cellars of a Dominican friary in 1770, for the Meynell family. It is now at the centre of Yarm School. Bishop Skirlaw of Durham built a stone bridge, which still stands, across the Tees in 1400. An iron replacement was built in 1805, but it fell down in 1806. For many years, Yarm was at the tidal limit and head of navigation on the River Tees. On 12 February 1821, at the George & Dragon Inn, the meeting was held that pressed for the third and successful attempt for a Bill to give permission to build the Stockton & Darlington Railway, the world's first public railway. In 1890, Bulmer & Co listed twelve inns in Yarm: Black Bull, Cross Keys, Crown Inn, Fleece, George and Dragon, Green Tree, Ketton Ox, Lord Nelson, Red Lion, Three Tuns, Tom Brown, and Union. Also listed was Cross Keys beside the Leven Bridge. In the 13th century, Yarm was classed as a borough, but this status did not persist. It formed part of the Stokesley Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894, and remained so until 1 April 1974 when, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became part of the district of Stockton-on-Tees in the new non-metropolitan county of Cleveland. Cleveland was abolished in 1996 under the Banham Review, with Stockton-on-Tees becoming a unitary authority.OPSI ‚Äì The Cleveland (Further Provision) Order 1995 The Yarm helmet is a Viking age helmet that was found in Yarm. It is the first relatively complete Anglo-Scandinavian helmet found in Britain and only the second Viking helmet discovered in north-west Europe. It is displayed in Preston Park Museum, Stockton-on-Tees. Geography A map of Yarm showing main roads and estates Yarm Town Hall. Yarm has five housing estates, and the peninsular area where the town centre is situated. The estates are Willey Flatts, Layfield Farm, The Kebbell (locally known as Spitalfields), Leven Park and Levendale (occasionally referred to as Ingleby Grange). It is bordered by two rivers, the River Tees to the north, and the River Leven to the east. The Leven is a tributary of the Tees. Yarm was once the highest port on the Tees. Two road bridges cross the river, Yarm Bridge crossing from the High Street to Eaglescliffe, which is Grade II* listed, and Leven Bridge crossing the Leven between Yarm and Low Leven, which is Grade II listed. On 26 February 2010, Leven Bridge was closed after cracks appeared in it. Engineers suggested the bridge would remain closed for at least two weeks. Later it was confirmed that the bridge would be closed for up to three months after major damage was found to the Grade II-listed structure. Repairs took less time than expected, and the bridge re-opened on 18 June 2010. The town hall High Street was built in 1710 by Thomas Belasyse who was Lord of the Manor. In a poll taken for the BBC's Breakfast programme on 19 January 2007, Yarm's High Street was voted the 'Best High Street': the street and its cobbled parking areas is fronted by many Georgian-style old buildings, with their red pantile roofs. The Rookery The A67, which runs through High Street was previously classified as the A19 until a dual carriageway was built in the 1970s, about three miles south of the town near the village of Crathorne. When the A19 ran through High Street, it was heavily congested. The road was used by heavy goods traffic as a shortcut to Teesside International Airport. The classification of the road as an 'A'-road meant that it was difficult to place a ban on heavy goods vehicles; however the town council made efforts to come up with voluntary agreements with many haulage firms until 2012, when all HGV traffic was banned from the route through Yarm and Egglescliffe. Yarm has multiple areas of woodland, most of which are part of private estates. The Rookery is a public area by the River Tees situated at the bottom of Goose Pasture. The ash, sycamore and lime woodland is about 200 years old and owned by Yarm Town Council.The information board erected at the entrance to the woodland. In 2002, a walkway was constructed around the wood to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Within the woodland, close to the river, BMX riders have created numerous dirt ramps which are regularly used during summer months. Governance =House of Commons= Yarm is part of the Stockton South Parliamentary Constituency which is represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 14 December 2019 by Matt Vickers, a Conservative MP. It was represented from 8 May 2017 by Dr Paul Williams (Labour), \\"a local GP\\" who lost his seat at the 2019 General Election. From 2010 to 2017 the constituency was represented by James Wharton (Conservative); He was elected on 6 May 2010 for Stockton South. James Wharton was re-elected with an increased majority on 7 May 2015. In August 2016 he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development. The bridges of Yarm From 1997 to 2010, the constituency was represented by Dari Taylor (Labour). =Borough Council= The Yarm ward of Stockton, which includes Kirklevington, has three local councillors sitting on Stockton Borough Council. From 3 May 2007 until May 2011, they were Conservative councillors Jennie Beaumont, Jackie Earl and Andrew Sherris. From 5 May 2011, Conservatives Mark Chatburn, Ben Houchen, and Andrew Sherris became the councillors on the Stockton on Tees Borough Council for the Yarm Ward. Mark Chatburn subsequently defected to UKIP on 22 March 2013. =Town council= Yarm has a town council which is responsible for certain aspects of the town's administration, including allotments and the cemetery. It meets once a month in the town hall. The council has eleven seats with a chairman who, for ceremonial purposes, is 'Mayor'. The Standing Orders of the Council restrict the chairman's period of office to two years in any four-year period. The 2015 chairman was Clr Jason Hadlow. Elections for the council are held every four years. December 2008 by-election A by-election was held for two vacant seats on the council after the resignation of one, and disqualification of another Conservative councillor. The Conservative Party fielded two candidates against two Independent candidates who stood under the banner 'Former Councillor'. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrats chose not to field any candidates, the former instead backing the Independents. Turnout for the election was low, with the Conservative candidates elected by a small margin. October 2009 by-election After the departure of a Conservative councillor, a by-election was held on 15 October 2009 for one seat on the town council. Peter Monck, a former town councillor and Liberal Democrat candidate for Stockton South in the 1997 general election stood as an independent candidate against Paul Smith, a Conservative party candidate. Transport The railway viaduct was built between 1849 and 1851 for the Leeds Northern Railway Company. Its designers were Thomas Grainger and John Bourne. It comprises seven million bricks, and has 43 arches, with the two that span the River Tees being skewed and made of stone. The current un-manned modern station, opened in 1996, is located on Green Lane near Conyers' School, about a mile south of Yarm High Street. * Road access: the A67 leading to Teesside International Airport and Darlington in the north west, the A135 leading to the A66 and Stockton in the north, the B1265 leading to the A167 and Northallerton in the west, the A1044 leading to the A174 and Middlesbrough in the east, and the A67 leading to the A19 and Thirsk in the south * Rail access: Yarm Station also Eaglescliffe railway station * Nearest airport: Teesside International Airport (MME) Arriva North East is the main bus operator serving Yarm and operate the following services: * Service 7: Yarm Willey Flatts‚ÄìEaglescliffe‚ÄìStockton * Service 12A Yarm‚ÄìHartburn‚ÄìStockton‚ÄìTeesdale‚ÄìMiddlesbrough * Service X6 Yarm‚ÄìIngleby Barwick‚ÄìMiddlesbrough WP & M Hutchinson operate one route serving Yarm: * Service 82 Yarm‚ÄìHutton Rudby‚ÄìStokesley Leven Valley Coaches is the other operator, running the following services: * Service 507: Yarm‚ÄìHilton‚ÄìMaltby‚ÄìThornaby‚ÄìStockton * Service 551: Willey Flatts‚ÄìEaglescliffe‚ÄìStockton‚ÄìBillingham‚ÄìLow Grange * Service 577: Yarm Willey Flatts‚ÄìEaglescliffe‚ÄìStockton Religion The parish church Yarm Methodist Church. Yarm Parish Church is the Anglican parish church, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. It is situated on West Street, where there has been a church on the site since at least the 9th century. It was last rebuilt from the remains of the second, Norman, church in 1730. It is a Grade II* listed building. The Roman Catholic (RC) church of Ss Mary and Romuald, built in 1860, is at the south end of High Street. It is a Grade II listed building. Yarm Methodist Church, an octagonal church built in 1763, is on Chapel Yard, on the east side of the town by the river, and is the oldest octagonal church in current use in Methodism. It is a Grade II listed building. Sports Yarm Rugby Club is based at Wass Way, Eaglescliffe. The club has grown significantly since forming in February 1998. They run teams and training sessions for most ages from youth to seniors. Currently playing in Durham and Northumberland Division 3. Yarm Cricket Club is situated on Leven Road, and has been in existence since 1814. It runs three senior teams in the North Yorkshire South Durham League, and four junior sides ‚Äì under 11s, under 13s, under 15s and under 17s ‚Äì who all play competitive cricket throughout the season. In recent years, Yarm's third team, who play on a Sunday, have been the most successful team in the club, winning the NYSD Sunday Division 1 on several occasions, along with the League and Cup double in 2008. Other sports facilities within Yarm include a floodlit state-of-the-art 4G football pitch, located at Conyers' School. This facility is run by the Go-Sport group and has been the home ground for local youth and adult football clubs, including Yarm Town Juniors and Yarm FC. In 2016, the Go-Sport group hosted an FA-accredited 11-a-side Midweek Football League, contested by various local clubs, including TIBS F.C. from Ingleby Barwick. The winners of this inaugural trophy were L&H; F.C., who had a 3‚Äì1 victory in the final. Events Yarm Fair 2017 Many events are held in the town each year such as a Gala, Fair and a 5 km Fun Run. After lying dormant for almost 100 years the Yarm Gala restarted in 2008. A charter to hold a weekly market was granted by King John in 1207. It lapsed, but was revived in 2011 as a Farmers' Market. It is held on the second Sunday of each month. A fair is held in High Street in the third week in October. It starts on the Tuesday evening, and is officially opened on the Thursday. It lasts until Saturday night. It was once a commercial fair that traded in cheese and livestock, but is now primarily a funfair. Travellers still attend the fair and ride horses up and down the street on the Saturday. The travellers have to wait outside the town until 6:00 pm on the Tuesday, at which point they are allowed to cross the bridge over the River Tees into the town. Education There are three primary schools in the town: * Levendale (single form entry) * Yarm Primary Schoolhttp://www.sbcschools.org.uk/yarm/ (two form entry) * Layfield Primary Schoolhttp://web.mac.com/layfieldprimary/Yarm_primary_school_Layfield_Every_child_matters/Yarm_Layfield_Primary_school.html (single form entry) Conyers' School, with about 1,400 pupils, is a mixed comprehensive school; it has also a sixth-form. It was founded in 1594 as 'the Free Grammar School' by Thomas Conyers. Following the change to comprehensive education, it was renamed to reflect its founder. Conyers' School is a specialist school for maths and computing. The town is home to the independent Yarm School with about 1,200 pupils; the senior school being situated at the Friarage, and the preparatory school and nursery at the old Yarm Grammar School. The school was founded in 1978, some time after the re-designation of the original grammar school. The school had plans to move within the next decade to a site near to their playing fields on Green Lane, south of the town. However, planning permission was not granted by the local council, and Yarm School is no longer planning to move, instead choosing to renovate and improve the current site. Public services On the southern edge of the built up area of Yarm, is HM Prison Kirklevington Grange, a men's resettlement prison for inmates intending to settle, on release, in the North East of England. Notable people People associated with the town include John Wesley, founder of Methodism, and Tom Brown, hero of the Battle of Dettingen, who consequently became the last man to be knighted on the battlefield. His old house is still located on the High Street and dates from around 1480, pre- dating the Elizabethan period and is the oldest standing dwelling in the former County of Cleveland. Yarm has also been home to professional footballers including Middlesbrough and Dutch international George Boateng who now works outside the UK, and former Valencia and Spain International Gaizka Mendieta. Former England boss Steve McClaren also regularly visits the town, as his family home is situated in the neighbouring village of Aislaby. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, and West End playwright and international screenwriter Graham Farrow also live in Yarm. The cricketer William Halton was born at Yarm. Twinned towns Signage seen on entering Yarm. Yarm is twinned with two other European towns: * Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany * Vernouillet, France There is also an agreement with Olkusz, in Poland. On 2 July 2005, two trees were planted to the north of the town hall to mark the 20th anniversary of the twinning between Yarm and the two towns. The trees were marked with plaques.

This means ensuring that members of the party vote according to the party platform, rather than according to their own individual ideology or the will of their donors or constituents. Whips are the party's \\"enforcers\\". They try to ensure that their fellow political party legislators attend voting sessions and vote according to their party's official policy. Members who vote against party policy may \\"lose the whip\\", effectively expelling them from the party. The term is taken from the \\"whipper-in\\" during a hunt, who tries to prevent hounds from wandering away from a hunting pack. Additionally, the term \\"whip\\" may mean the voting instructions issued to legislators,Pandiyan, M. Veera (May 14, 2006). How the term 'Whip' came to be used in Parliament. The Star (Malaysia). or the status of a certain legislator in their party's parliamentary grouping. Etymology The expression whip in its parliamentary context has its origins in hunting terminology. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term whipper-in as, \\"a huntsman's assistant who keeps the hounds from straying by driving them back with the whip into the main body of the pack\\". According to that dictionary, the first recorded use of the term whipper-in in the parliamentary sense occurs in 1772. However, P.D.G. Thomas in House of Commons in the Eighteenth Century cites two examples of the use of the term that pre-date 1772.House of Commons briefing note: The Whip's Office Doc ref. SN/PC/02829. Last updated 10 October 2008 In countries using the Westminster system =Australia= In the Parliament of Australia, as well as in the parliaments of the six states and two self-governing territories, major political parties have whips to ensure party discipline and carry out a variety of other functions on behalf of the party leadership. The most important function of the whip's office is to ensure that all members and senators are present to take part in votes in the chamber (maintaining quorum and preventing censure motions).Parliamentary Education Office. Fact Sheet 36: The Party Whip. Unlike in the United Kingdom, Australian whips do not hold official office, but they are recognised for parliamentary purposes. In practice, Australian whips play a lesser role than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, as party discipline in Australia tends to be tighter.Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library. Free Votes in Australian and some Overseas Parliaments. Their roles in the chamber include taking divisions, and maintaining a \\"pairs book\\" which controls the ability of members and senators to leave the parliament building during sittings, as well as the entitlement to be absent during divisions. Liberal Party whips are appointed by the leader of the party, while Australian Labor Party whips are elected by the Caucus. For Labor and the Liberals, the chief whip is assisted by two deputy whips. =Canada= In Canada the Party Whip is the member of a political party in the Canadian House of Commons, the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislature charged with ensuring party discipline among members of the caucus. The whip is also responsible for assigning offices and scheduling speakers from his or her party for various bills, motions and other proceedings in the House. =India= In India, the concept of the whip was inherited from colonial British rule. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party's discipline and behaviours on the floor of the house. Usually, they direct the party members to stick to the party's stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members. However, there are some cases such as Indian Presidential elections where whips cannot direct a Member of Parliament (MP) or Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) on whom to vote. Should a whip's order be violated by a member of the same party, then the whip can recommend immediate dismissal of that member from the house due to indiscipline and the Speaker of the respective house can decide on the matter (without time limit). Should the whip choose not follow up on the violation his/her official whip order by own party member due to any reason, then any member of house can do so to the Speaker. =Ireland= Whips exist for all parliamentary parties in D√°il √âireann and Seanad √âireann. The government chief whip is normally a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, and attends cabinet meetings. The whips of each house meet weekly to set the agenda for the next week's business. The Technical Group in the D√°il and the analogous Independent groups in the Seanad nominate whips to attend these meetings even though there is no party line for their whips to enforce. Whips also coordinate pairing. The timing of most votes are difficult to predict and TDs are expected to stay within earshot of the division bell at all times. All TDs are expected to vote with their party and to receive permission if they intend to be absent for a vote. Free votes are not a common feature of the Irish parliamentary tradition but they do happen on occasion, and there are calls for them to happen more often. For instance, Fianna F√°il usually allowed a free vote on abortion bills, as in the Protection of Human Life In Pregnancy Act. From 1998, whips and assistant whips may be entitled to an allowance on top of their base legislator's salary.Oireachtas (Allowances To Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act, 1998 Irish Statute Book In 2011, these allowances varied proportional to the size of the group, with Fianna F√°il's D√°il whip's allowance the highest at ‚Ç¨19,000.S.I. No. 347/2011 ‚Äî Oireachtas (Allowances) (Members and Holders of Parliamentary and Certain Ministerial Offices) Order 2011 Irish Statute Book =Malaysia= Party whips in Malaysia serve a similar role as in other Westminster system-based parliamentary democracies. However, party discipline tends to be tighter in Malaysia and therefore the role of the whip is generally less important, though its importance is heightened when the government majority is less in the lower house. Unlike in the UK and other countries, Barisan Nasional whips always hold office of Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia as well as the deputy leader of the party. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, the concept of the whip was inherited from British rule. All political parties that have four or more members in Parliament have at least one party whip, although Green Party whips are called musterers. Parties with 25 to 44 members are allowed two whips (one senior and one junior), and parties with 45 or more members are entitled to three whips (one senior and two junior). Whips act in an administrative role, making sure members of their party are in the debating chamber when required and organising members of their party to speak during debates. Since the introduction of proportional representation in 1996, divisions that require all members in the chamber to vote by taking sides (termed a personal vote) are rarely used, except for conscience votes. Instead, one of the party's whips votes on behalf of all the members of their party, by declaring how many members are in favour and/or how many members are opposed. They also cast proxy votes for single-member parties whose member is not in the chamber at the time of the vote, and also cast proxy votes during personal votes for absent members of their parties and for absent members of associated single-member parties. =United Kingdom= In British politics, the chief whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is customarily appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury so that the incumbent, who represents the whips in general, has a seat and a voice in the Cabinet. By virtue of holding the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, the government chief whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street, although the chief whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street. Government whips report to the prime minister on any possible backbench revolts and the general opinion of MPs within the party, and upon the exercise of the patronage, which is used to motivate and reward loyalty. In the sense of 'voting instructions', there are three categories of whip in British politics that are issued on particular business. An expressed instruction on how to vote could constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege, so the party's wishes are indicated unequivocally but indirectly. These whips are issued to MPs in the form of a letter outlining the parliamentary schedule, with a sentence such as \\"Your attendance is absolutely essential\\" next to each debate in which there will be a vote, underlined one, two or three times according to the severity of the whip: *A single-line whip is a guide to what the party's policy would indicate, and notification of when the vote is expected to take place; this is non-binding for attendance or voting. *A two-line whip, sometimes known as a double-line whip, is an instruction to attend and vote; partially binding for voting according to the party's position, attendance required unless prior permission given by the whip. *A three-line whip is a strict instruction to attend and vote according to the party's position, breach of which would normally have serious consequences. Permission to not attend may be given by the whip, but a serious reason is needed. Breach of a three-line whip can lead to expulsion from the parliamentary political group in extreme circumstances, and even to expulsion from the party. Consequently, three-line whips are generally only issued on key issues, such as votes of confidence and supply. The nature of three-line whips and the potential punishments for revolt vary among parties and legislatures. In other countries =South Africa= Although South Africa uses a proportional representation system, the concept of a political party whip, which was inherited from colonial British rule, has been maintained.Parliamentary Monitoring Group. Structure of Government - Office bearers of legislative institutionsChief Whips on Parliament Website In 2017, African National Congress secretary general Gwede Mantashe said \\"Voting according to conscience doesn't work in a political party system. We all get into the list of things and go to Parliament as parliamentarians of the ANC [...] There will be no voting against the ANC.\\" =Taiwan= Party whips exist in most of the major parties of the Legislative Yuan. For example, in the Democratic Progressive Party the party whip is the Caucus leader. In the Kuomintang the party whip is the executive director of the Policy Committee or the caucus leader. When voting for critical bills, whips may issue a top- mobilization order asking members to attend the assembly. Party members failing to obey the order will be suspended or expelled from the party. =United States= In the United States there are legislatures at the local (city councils, town councils, county boards, etc.), state, and federal levels. The federal legislature (Congress), the legislatures in all states except for Nebraska, and many county and city legislative bodies are divided along party lines and have whips, as well as majority and minority leaders. The whip is also the assistant majority or assistant minority leader. Both houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, have majority and minority whips. They in turn have subordinate \\"regional\\" whips. While members of Congress often vote along party lines, the influence of the whip is weaker than in the UK system. American politicians generally have considerably more freedom to diverge from the party line and vote according to their own or their constituency's conscience. One reason is that a considerable amount of money is raised by individual candidates. Furthermore, neither members of Congress, nor any other person, can be expelled from a political party, which are formed simply by open registration. In addition, because preselection of candidates for office is generally done through a primary election that is open to a wide number of voters, candidates who support their constituents' political positions, rather than those of their party leaders, cannot easily be rejected by their party due to a democratic mandate. Because members of Congress cannot serve simultaneously in Executive Branch positions, a whip in the United States cannot bargain for votes by using potential promotion or demotion in a sitting administration as an inducement. There is, however, a highly structured committee system in both houses of Congress, and a whip may be able to offer promotion or threaten demotion within that system instead. In the House of Representatives, the influence of a single member individually is relatively small and therefore depends a great deal on the representative's seniority (i.e., in most cases, on the length of time they have held office). In the Senate, the majority whip is the third-highest ranking individual in the majority party (the party with the most seats). The majority whip is outranked by the majority leader and, unofficially, the president pro tempore. As the office of president pro tempore is largely honorific and usually given to the longest-serving senator of the majority, the majority whip is in reality the second-ranking senator in the majority conference. Similarly, in the House, the majority whip is outranked by both the majority leader and the speaker. Unlike the Senate's presiding officer, the Speaker is the leader of his or her party's caucus in the House. In both the House and the Senate, the minority whip is the second highest-ranking individual in the minority party (the party with the lesser number of legislators in a legislative body), outranked only by the minority leader. The whip position was created in the House of Representatives in 1897 by Republican Speaker Thomas Reed, who appointed James A. Tawney as the first whip. The first Democratic whip, Oscar Wilder Underwood, was appointed around 1900. In the Senate, the position was created in 1913 by John W. Kern, chair of the Democratic caucus, when he appointed J. Hamilton Lewis as the first whip, while Republicans later chose James Wadsworth as the party's first in 1915. In popular culture British author and politician Michael Dobbs wrote a trilogy of books, centred around a fictional party whip named Francis Urquhart, which was dramatised and broadcast by the BBC between 1990 and 1995. The first book in the trilogy, titled House of Cards, was adapted into a television series and the title has also been used for subsequent series based on other countries' political systems. In House of Cards, Francis Urquhart is the Chief Whip for the UK Conservative Party and the trilogy charts his ambitious rise through his party's ranks until he becomes Prime Minister. In the American remake of House of Cards, Frank Underwood is the House Majority Whip for the US Democratic Party. The series charts Underwood's ambitious rise through his party's ranks until he becomes President. The name Frank Underwood was chosen to have the same initials as the original trilogy's protagonist Francis Urquhart, and to reference Oscar Underwood, the first ever party whip for the US Democratic Party.

A wyvern ( , sometimes spelled wivern) is a legendary bipedal winged dragon, usually depicted with a tail ending in a diamond- or arrow-shaped tip. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/wyvern/ As bipeds, wyverns often possess only two legs and no arms or front appendages. The wyvern in its various forms is important to heraldry, frequently appearing as a mascot of schools and athletic teams (chiefly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada). It is a popular creature in European literature, video games, and modern fantasy. The wyvern in heraldry and folklore is rarely fire-breathing like the four-legged dragon. Sometimes modern fantasy book and media authors portray wyverns that are frost-breathing or poison-breathing instead of fire- breathing.  Etymology  The current spelling wyvern is not attested before the seventeenth century as \\"winged two-footed dragon\\". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is an alteration of Middle English wyver (attested thirteenth century), from Anglo-French wivre (cf. French guivre and vouivre), which originate from Latin vƒ´pera, meaning \\"viper\\", \\"adder\\", or \\"asp\\". Conversely, medievalist William Sayers proposes a more complex origin for the term. He notes that the Anglo-French guivre and its Middle English derivative ceased to retain the original sense of \\"venomous snake\\" after the Latin term was re-introduced into medieval Latin, freeing them up to take an alternate meaning.Sayers, William. \\"The Wyvern\\". Neuphilologische Mitteilungen 109.4 (2008): 457-465. Adducing another meaning of wiver (this time Old English) and guivre, \\"light javelin\\", and noting partial resemblances between the size and shape of javelins and snakes, plus the later medieval era's increasing use of heavy armor and decreasing use of light javelins, he proposes that the concepts of \\"venomous snake\\" and \\"light javelin\\" were melded to produce a new term for a previously unimagined concept of flying snake, a kind of dragon.  History  Y Draig Aur; A flag which was carried by Owain Glyndwr who most noticeably displayed it at Twt hill after his successes in reclaiming Welsh territory. A golden wyvern is believed to have been the symbol of the medieval kingdom of Wessex The design of the wyvern is thought to have derived from the figure of the dragon encountered by Trajan's legions in Dacia. It may be the origin of the red dragon of Wales and the golden dragon of the Kingdom of Wessex carried at the Battle of Burford in AD 752. The depiction of dragons representing Wales goes back centuries; as seen in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, when depicting Merlin's prophecy of the red dragon of Wales beating the white Anglo-Saxon dragon, they are seen to have two legs rather than the modern four legs that the current Welsh dragon possesses.https://www.visitwales.com/info/history-heritage-and- traditions/dragon-spirit-legend-welsh-dragon Since the 4th century, Welsh Kings and princes have carried with them this depiction of a dragon, each ruler changing its appearance from a Wyvern to a four-legged dragon. The concept of winged snakes is common in cultures around the Mediterranean, with a notable example being the Egyptian goddess Wadjet.Valery Rees, From Gabriel to Lucifer: A Cultural History of Angels, I.B.Tauris, 19/03/2013 The oldest creatures outright referred to as \\"winged dragons\\" are Helios's chariot steeds, which aid Medea.  Distinction from dragons  Wyverns are very similar to dragons, and in many languages, cultures and contexts no clear distinction is made between the two. Since the sixteenth century, in English, Scottish, and Irish heraldry, the key difference has been that a wyvern has two legs, whereas a dragon has four. However, this distinction is not commonly observed in the heraldry of other European countries, where two-legged dragon- like creatures being called dragons is entirely acceptable.  In modern fiction  In the modern fantasy genre, there is little differentiation between dragons and wyverns, with two-legged magical reptilian creatures all likely to be referred to as \\"dragons\\" without any differentiation between types. Wyverns, when present as creatures distinct from dragons, tend to appear as less magical and more as dangerous beasts: smaller, weaker, and less intelligent than dragons. While a fantasy dragon often has a breath weapon, such as fire, wyverns rarely have such abilities and are more feared for their ferocity and sharp teeth and claws. Wyverns are sometimes associated with poison, either in the form of venomous fangs or tail barb, or poisonous breath, but this trait is not universally represented and may be a more recent addition to the lore based on the gila monster. The wyvern frequently features in modern fantasy fiction, though its first literary appearances may have been in medieval bestiaries.A wyvern and an elephant may be found at Harley MS 3244 (dated 13th century, after c. 1236), f.39v.  In heraldry  supporting the arms of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough The wyvern is a frequent charge in English heraldry and vexillology, also occasionally appearing as a supporter or crest. A wyvern is typically depicted resting upon its legs and tail, but may be depicted with its claws in the air and only supported by its tail. On occasion, a wyvern may be depicted as wingless and with its tail nowed. A white (Argent) wyvern formed the crest of the Borough of Leicester as recorded at the heraldic visitation of Leicestershire in 1619: \\"A wyvern sans legs argent strewed with wounds gules, wings expanded ermine.\\" The term \\"sans legs\\" may not imply that the wyvern was \\"without legs\\", rather than its legs are not depicted, being hidden or folded under.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic & Corporate Heraldry, London 1971 C.

A green Wyvern stands in the emblem of the ancient and historical Umbrian city of Terni, the dragon is called by the citizens with the name of Thyrus. A sable wyvern on a white background with endorsed wings forms the coat of arms of the Tilley family. The arms of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries depict a wyvern, symbolising disease, being overcome by Apollo, symbolising medicine.  As a logo or mascot  The wyvern is also a fairly popular commercial logo or mascot, especially in Wales and what was once the West Country Kingdom of Wessex, but also farther afield in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, as the rivers Wye and Severn run through Hereford and Worcester respectively. A local radio station was formerly called Wyvern FM. Vauxhall Motors had a model in its range in the 1950s called the Wyvern. The Westland Wyvern was a British single-seat carrier-based multi-role strike aircraft built by Westland Aircraft that served in the 1950s, seeing active service in the 1956 Suez Crisis. The wyvern is a frequent mascot of athletic teams, colleges and universities, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, and is the mascot of the Korea Baseball Organization team SK Wyverns, established in 2000, King's College, within the University of Queensland, and the Japanese basketball team, the Passlab Yamagata Wyverns of the Japanese B.League The wyvern is also the mascot of the 51st Operations Support Squadron at Osan Air Base, with the motto: \\"breathin' fire!\\" A wyvern is depicted on the unit crest of the USAF 31st Fighter Wing.

There are several other temples in Asakusa, as well as various festivals, such as the Sanja Matsuri. History The development of Asakusa as an entertainment district during the Edo period came about in part because of the neighboring district, Kuramae. Kuramae was a district of storehouses for rice, which was then used as payment for servants of the feudal government. The keepers (fudasashi) of these storage houses initially stored the rice for a small fee, but over the years began exchanging the rice for money or selling it to local shopkeepers at a margin. Through such trading, many fudasashi came to have a considerable amount of disposable income and as result theaters and geisha houses began to spring up in nearby Asakusa. For most of the twentieth century, Asakusa remained a major entertainment district in Tokyo. The rokku or \\"Sixth District\\" was in particular famous as a theater district, featuring famous cinemas such as the Denkikan. The golden years of Asakusa are vividly portrayed in Yasunari Kawabata's novel The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa (1930; English translation, 2005). The area was heavily damaged by US bombing raids during World War II, particularly the 10 March 1945 firebombing of Tokyo. The area was rebuilt after the war, but has now been surpassed by Shinjuku and other colorful areas in the city, in its role as a pleasure district. Asakusa was a ward of Tokyo City. In 1947, when the city was transformed into a metropolis, it was merged with Shitaya to form the modern Taito ward. The former ward encompassed 19 neighborhoods in the eastern half of Taito. Geography Asakusa is on the north-east fringe of central Tokyo, at the eastern end of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line subway, approximately one mile east of the major railway/subway interchange. It is central to the area colloquially referred to as Shitamachi, which literally means \\"low city,\\" referring to the low elevation of this old part of Tokyo, on the banks of the Sumida River. As the name suggests, the area has a more traditionally Japanese atmosphere than some other neighborhoods in Tokyo do. Sightseeing and historic sites With so many religious establishments, there are frequent matsuri (Shinto festivals) in Asakusa, as each temple or shrine hosts at least one matsuri a year, if not every season. The largest and most popular is the Sanja Matsuri in May, when roads are closed from dawn until late in the evening. Poet Matsuo Bash≈ç referred to Asakusa's temple in a haiku. Food and drink Asakusa has many restaurants and places to try traditional Japanese foods. One of the most popular treats is satsuma imo, sweet potatoes. Another special treat is chikuwa kamaboko, grilled fish cakes. The Suzuhiro store serves local craft beer with traditional kamaboko. Asakusa is also known for spices such as shichimi and sansho. Two geishas relaxing after having entertained; the insets showing the curfew bell at Asakusa. Ukiyo-e woodblock print by Y≈çsh≈´ Chikanobu, 1888 In a city where there are very few buildings older than 50 years because of the wartime bombing, Asakusa has a greater concentration of buildings from the 1950s and 1960s than most other areas in Tokyo do. There are traditional ryokan (guest-houses), homes, and small-scale apartment buildings throughout the district. Temple in Asakusa In keeping with a peculiarly Tokyo tradition, Asakusa hosts a major cluster of domestic kitchenware stores on Kappabashi-dori, which is visited by many Tokyoites for essential supplies. Next to the Sens≈ç-ji temple grounds is a small amusement park called Hanayashiki, which claims to be the oldest amusement park in Japan. The neighborhood theaters specialize in showing classic Japanese films, as many of the tourists are elderly Japanese. Cruises down the Sumida River depart from a wharf a five-minute walk from the temple. Asakusa is Tokyo's oldest geisha district, and still has 45 actively working geisha. Because of its colourful location, downtown credentials, and relaxed atmosphere by Tokyo standards, Asakusa is a popular accommodation choice for budget travelers. Carnival The neighborhood is famous for its annual Brazilian style carnival. There is a significant Brazilian presence in the local community and the Association of Samba Schools of Asakusa is based there.Tamborins.com.br (in Portuguese)  Sanja Matsuri  Although there are many festivals throughout the year in Asakusa, the most famous of them is the Sanja Matsuri, also known as Sanja Festival in May. In this festival, Mikoshi (portable shrines) and floats are pulled through the streets while loud shouts accompany them, and during the festival's 3 days, 1.5 million people come out to celebrate.

George Weedon (1734‚Äì1793) was an American soldier during the Revolutionary War from Fredericksburg, Colony of Virginia. He served as a brigadier general in the Continental Army and later in the Virginia militia. Weedon served as a lieutenant under George Washington in the French and Indian War, mainly assigned to garrison duty in western Virginia. After the war, he moved to Fredericksburg and opened a tavern. It was within Weedon's tavern that Thomas Jefferson in January 1777 wrote the Statute of Religious Freedom; the very first document of its kind to acknowledge government recognition of religious tolerance. In 1775, he was made a lieutenant colonel and second in command to Hugh Mercer. They were tasked with creating the 3rd Virginia Regiment, Virginia Line, Continental Army. He was promoted to colonel in 1776 and succeeded Mercer in command of his regiment. On Mercer's death at Princeton, Weedon was promoted to brigadier general in 1777 and again succeeded him. He fought in the Battles of Trenton, Brandywine, and Germantown. At Valley Forge, Weedon commanded a brigade in Nathanael Greene's division. His brigade included Stewart's 13th Pennsylvania Regiment along with the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th Virginia regiments. In 1778, he resigned after a dispute with the Congress over seniority. He went home to Virginia to lead a brigade of the state's militia at the request of Governor Thomas Jefferson. He led his militia unit in the Yorktown campaign, where his brigade successfully repelled the feared and infamous unit of Colonel Banastre Tarleton, thus closing the one means of British escape at Gloucester Point.

The count at the 2011 Census was 2,857 for the gazetted suburb of Morisset. The estimated urban population of the Morisset area, including Cooranbong, was 25,309 as at June 2018. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. The area is growing steadily, with population increasing 2.6 percent over the prior year, 2017, and having five-year average annual growth of 1.8 percent. History The town is named for Major James Thomas Morisset, who camped there in 1823 while making the overland journey from Sydney to Newcastle. Morisset went on to become Commandant at Norfolk Island prison between 1829‚Äì1833, where his brutal regime led to a rebellion. Historically there has been considerable confusion over the spelling of the suburb: Morissett, Morriset, Morrissett and Morrisset have been used. The earliest settlement in the area was at Cooranbong in 1826, about west of the current town and near the foot of the Watagan Mountains. Initially, various kinds of agriculture were conducted, and before long forestry became an important industry. Most of the transport to the area at the time was by river boat on Dora Creek meaning that Cooranbong was the most accessible part of town. The town of Morisset itself was essentially non-existent until 1887, when the Sydney-Newcastle railway was built. Morisset sprang up as a sawmill town clustered around the train station, and the township was proclaimed on 3 December. In 1908, a psychiatric hospital opened on a large estate along the lake shore. At its height in the 1960s, Morisset Mental Hospital had 1,600 patients. The Hospital continues to dominate Morisset's reputation, although it is now only a 130-bed hospital. The first bus service was started by the Ward family. In more recent times, the Morisset Peninsula to the east of the town has become the main residential area. It has experienced a high rate of growth since the construction of Eraring Power Station in 1986. Most of Bonnells Bay is now what long-time residents quaintly refer to as \\"high- density housing\\", although by city standards it is decidedly low-density. Several retirement villages have been built, most of them only in the last decade. Subdivision of larger blocks has come close to saturation in many suburbs, with only a few hobby-farms still remaining, although the majority of the Morisset district and peninsula remain bushland and National Park and Aboriginal reserves. Heritage listings Morisset has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Morisset Park Road: Morisset Hospital Education Morisset contains a state primary school, a state high school and a Catholic school. Morisset Public School opened in 1891 and started accommodating high school classes in 1951. These classes transferred to a new high school campus, Morisset High School, at the start of the 1965 school year, with the public school returning to purely primary education. A Catholic primary school, St John Vianney School, opened on 17 January 1962, and was initially administered by the Sisters of St Joseph until becoming part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle in 1966. Transport Morisset train station Morisset railway station, located on Dora Street, is linked to Sydney and Newcastle by NSW TrainLink services on the Central Coast & Newcastle Line, and to Maitland and towns further north by long-distance services.

It is a popular upscale shopping area of Tokyo, with numerous internationally renowned department stores, boutiques, restaurants and coffeehouses located in its vicinity. It is considered to be one of the most expensive, elegant, and luxurious streets in the world. Ginza was a part of the old Kyobashi ward of Tokyo City, which, together with Nihonbashi and Kanda, formed the core of Shitamachi, the original downtown center of Edo-Tokyo.  History  Miniature model at the Edo-Tokyo Museum showing Ginza as it appeared in the late 1870s and 1880s. Ginza in the early 1900s, photographed by William H. Rau Ginza was built upon a former swamp that was filled in during the 16th century. The name Ginza comes after the establishment of a silver-coin mint established there in 1612, during the Edo period. After a devastating fire in 1872 burned down most of the area, the Meiji government designated the Ginza area as a \\"model of modernization.\\" The government planned the construction of fireproof brick buildings and larger, better streets connecting Shimbashi Station all the way to the foreign concession in Tsukiji. Soon after the fire, redevelopment schemes were prepared by Colin Alexander McVeanHideo Izumida, Reconsideration of Foundation of Engineering Education by Ministry of Public Works, Journal of Architectural Institute of Japan, February 2016, Vol.81-No.720, pp.478-488. a chief surveyor of the Public Works under direction of Yamao Yozo, but execution designs were provided by the Irish-born engineer Thomas Waters; the Bureau of Construction of the Ministry of Finance was in charge of construction. In the following year, a Western-style shopping promenade on the street from the Shinbashi bridge to the Ky≈çbashi bridge in the southwestern part of Ch≈´≈ç with two- and three-story Georgian brick buildings was completed. These \\"bricktown\\" buildings were initially offered for sale and later were leased, but the high rent prevented many of them from being permanently occupied. Moreover, the construction was not adapted to the climate, and the bold design contrasted the traditional Japanese notion of home construction. The new Ginza was not popular with visiting foreigners, who were looking for a more Edo-styled city. Isabella Bird visited in 1878 and in 1880 implied that Ginza was less like an Oriental city than like the outskirts of Chicago or Melbourne. Philip Terry, the English writer of tour guides, likened it to Broadway, not in a positive sense. Nevertheless, the area flourished as a symbol of \\"civilization and enlightenment\\" thanks to the presence of newspapers and magazine companies, which helped spread the latest trends of the day. The area was also known for its window displays, an example of modern marketing techniques. Everyone visited so the custom of \\"killing time in Ginza\\" developed strongly between the two world wars. Most of these European- style buildings disappeared, but some older buildings still remain, most famously the Wak≈ç building with the now-iconic Hattori Clock Tower. The building and the clock tower were originally built by Kintar≈ç Hattori, the founder of Seiko. Its recent history has seen it as a prominent outpost of Western luxury shops. Ginza is a popular destination on weekends, when the main north-south artery is closed to traffic since the 1960s, under governor Ryokichi Minobe.  Economy  Many leading fashion houses' flagship stores are located here, in the area with the highest concentration of Western shops in Tokyo. It is one of two locations in Tokyo considered by Chevalier and Mazzalovo to be the best locations for a luxury goods store. The other prime location is Omotesand≈ç. Prominent high-end retailers include the American company Carolina Herrera New York, French companies Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent, Italian company Gucci and Austrian brands Swarovski and Riedel. Flagship electronic retail stores like the Sony showroom (which closed in 2017 and new building would open in 2022) and the Apple Store are also here (Ginza 2 chome). The electronics company, Ricoh is headquartered in the Ricoh Building in Ginza.\\"Company Data Richo's building is one of symbol of Ginza. .\\" Ricoh. Retrieved on January 13, 2009. The neighborhood is a major shopping district. It is home to Wako department store, which is located in a building dating from 1894. The building has a clock tower. There are many department stores in the area, including Hankyu, Seibu, and Matsuya, in which there are many shops: grocery stores, restaurants, women and men clothes, sports wear, and jewellers etc. There are also art galleries. Kabuki-za is the theater for kabuki, one of Japanese traditional playing, and locates on between Ginza and Tsukiji. The building was opened in 1889 and has been reconstructed several times because of war and fire. The present building was built in 2013.

Its main advantage is that it can be included in a silicon integrated circuit at very low cost. The principle of the sensor is that the forward voltage of a silicon diode, which may be the base-emitter junction of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), is temperature-dependent, according to the following equation: :V_{BE}=V_{G0}\\\\left(1-{\\\\frac{T}{T_0}}\\\\right)+V_{BE0}\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{T_0}\\\\right)+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{nkT}{q}\\\\right)\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{T_0}{T}\\\\right)+ \\\\left(\\\\frac{kT}{q}\\\\right)\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_C}{I_{C0}}\\\\right) \\\\, where :T = temperature in kelvins, :T0 = reference temperature, :VG0 = bandgap voltage at absolute zero, :VBE0 = junction voltage at temperature T0 and current IC0, :k = Boltzmann constant, :q = charge on an electron, :n = a device-dependent constant. Circuit of a Brokaw bandgap reference By comparing the voltages of two junctions at the same temperature, but at two different currents, IC1 and IC2, many of the variables in the above equation can be eliminated, resulting in the relationship: :\\\\Delta V_{BE}=\\\\frac{kT}{q}\\\\cdot\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_{C1}}{I_{C2}}\\\\right) \\\\, Note that the junction voltage is a function of current density, i.e. current/junction area, and a similar output voltage can be obtained by operating the two junctions at the same current, if one is of a different area to the other. A circuit that forces IC1 and IC2 to have a fixed N:1 ratio, James Bryant. \\"IC Temperature Sensors\\" . Analog Devices. 2008\\\\. gives the relationship: :\\\\Delta V_{BE}=\\\\frac{kT}{q}\\\\cdot\\\\ln\\\\left(N\\\\right) \\\\, An electronic circuit, such as the Brokaw bandgap reference, that measures ŒîVBE can therefore be used to calculate the temperature of the diode. The result remains valid up to about 200 ¬∞C to 250 ¬∞C, when leakage currents become large enough to corrupt the measurement. Above these temperatures, materials such as silicon carbide can be used instead of silicon. The voltage difference between two p-n junctions (e.g. diodes), operated at different current densities, is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). PTAT circuits using either BJT or CMOS transistors are widely used in temperature sensors (where we want the output to vary with temperature), and also in bandgap voltage references and other temperature-compensating circuits (where we want the same output at every temperature).

The Republic is most prominently portrayed in the prequel trilogy of films in the Star Wars franchise and is the prequel trilogy's main protagonist faction. In the original trilogy, set later in time, it is referred to as the Old Republic. The Republic is portrayed as a democratic constitutional republic that has sustained itself peacefully for over twenty-five thousand years, but is tied up in layers of bureaucracy. It is mainly overseen by the Senate, a body in the Legislative Branch of the Republic government. The Old Republic According to the large body of films and other fiction that belong to the Star Wars franchise, the Republic is formed 25,000 years before the events of Star Wars when the first \\"Galactic Constitution\\" is signed on Coruscant, after the Corellian Hyperdrive connects many worlds in the Core. The Republic is made up of several hundred thousands of worlds, and each planet or system has representation in the Republic Senate, which comprises most of the Republic Legislative Branch and the government itself. It starts off merely as an economic and protective alliance, mainly among the Core worlds. It eventually expands to the Colonies and other outlying worlds and regions, becoming a superpower rather than an alliance, and it becomes the central government for the galaxy. As the Republic expands, it comes into contact with the slave empire of Zygerria. Because slavery is disallowed in the Republic, it dislikes the Empire, as slavery is central to the Empire's political and economic system; accordingly, the Empire refuses to become part of the Republic. The Republic and Jedi declare war on the Empire and win. The Empire is reduced to a small no-harm alliance on Zygerria. The Sith (which formed in the Republic's early years) returns to original strength and invade Malachor. The first Sith War begins, which leads to the demise of the first Republic. The power of the new Sith Empire increases as the Republic's decreases. The Republic and Jedi forces fail to keep the Empire's Forces out of Republic Space. Soon, the Sith become a second superpower. Around this time, an ancestor of Pre Vizsla steals the darksaber from the Jedi Temple. Around 1000 years prior to Star Wars, the Dark Age begins and the Republic finally collapses. Right before the collapse, though, the Liberation of Coruscant occurs, and the Empire collapses. Soon the Republic reforms and demilitarizes at the Ruusan Reformation, shortly after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan. The upcoming multimedia project Star Wars: The High Republic will depict the galaxy 200 years before The Phantom Menace. The Republic puts a strong magnetic field on its neighbouring worlds rather than conquering them by force. This means the Republic expands slowly. The Republic finally takes control of the Mid Rim. Power blocs form out of the Republic, but the Jedi keep order. The Republic becomes peaceful but corrupt, and a Core-Rim distrust forms. When Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum comes to power, a standoff between the Trade Federation and the Republic leads to the Invasion of Naboo. Galactic Senate John Martin's c. 1823-1827 engraving, Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council, served as the design of the Galactic Senate in the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace.Fields of Influence: Conjunctions of Artists and Scientists 1815-1860, James Hamilton, p. 14-15 The Republic begins as a mutual protection and economic alliance among a number of planets in the Core. Each member world or system chooses a Senator to represent them in the Galactic Senate, the main body of the legislative branch of the government. Senators are ambassadors of their homeworlds or systems. Member worlds and systems maintain their governments and societies as long as it does not defy any central and core Republican laws. There are a wide variety of different local governments along the political spectrum: from monarchies to republics to hive-like communes. When the Republic's power and influence expand, many new areas of the galaxy are incorporated into the Republic. The Core and Colonies are the base of the Galactic Republic. A reorganization of senatorial representation occurs 1,000 years prior to Star Wars during the Ruusan Reformation. The most common organization for these new territories is to group regions into Sectors of about 50 inhabited worlds. Each sector is represented by a Senatorial Delegation. When the number of sectors becomes too large, sectors are organized into roughly a thousand regions, each represented by one delegation to the Senate. The Senate serves as the unicameral main body of the legislative branch, but has immense power over the entire Galactic Republic. The capital of the Republic, which contains the most political power and wealth, is Coruscant. Inside the Senate Building, there is an area in which the Senate debates, casts votes, and makes or passes bills. It contains 1,024 floating platforms, each of which contain a senator and his or her aides. Each platform in the senate represents a \\"sector\\" of the galaxy. A few platforms represent individual worlds of high importance, or worlds bringing special pleas to the Senate. Some represent special interest groups such as the Trade Federation, and other companies, corporations, and industries. Each senatorial delegation has one vote. In the spirit of C-SPAN2, Senate cam droids, also known as Senate hovercams, are floating cam droids used in the Galactic Senate to record the legislative sessions which were either kept secret, or released to the public. The members of the Senate elect a Supreme Chancellor from among their ranks who serves as the Senate's presiding officer and as the Republic's de facto leader. The Chancellor is assisted by the Vice Chair, who is presumably elected in the same manner as the Chancellor; the same Vice Chair is present throughout the entire prequel trilogy. The Senate follows pseudo-parliamentary rules. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum was forced out of office by the Senate in a motion of no confidence, introduced by Queen Padm√© Amidala of Naboo, for example. Senators receive one vote in all matters, procedural and substantive. The Chancellor is elected from within the Senate for a set term. The Senate gives the Chancellor emergency powers in times of crisis and removes him from office when necessary. The assembly is in turn divided into individual committees, each specializing in specific fields of government administration, and which were responsible for creating legislation to be reviewed by the full assembly. The Senate has some form of judicial power as well, although the Republic has a judicial branch, in which the Supreme Court was the main body. The main functions of the Senate are to mediate disputes between members, provide for the common defense, create and pass laws into effect that would benefit most of the Republic, and regulate inter-system trade. The Jedi Order, although technically not officially part of the Republic, are considered the defenders of the general Republic. The Republic often orders the Jedi to specific areas that require assistance. In this way, they are eventually the unofficial police force of the Republic. They become representatives of the Senate as well, to some extent. Despite the seemingly organized structure of the Republic, the waning years of the Republic are a time of corruption and great social injustice. The Senate becomes divided between those who genuinely wish to uphold the values and ideals of the Republic and those who wish to further their own goals. Following a series of weak and ineffectual Chancellors, there is a crisis involving the invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation over a tariff passed by the Senate. After Senator Palpatine of Naboo becomes Chancellor, he increases the power of the office, from acting as commander-in- chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, or the Republic Military, to the institution of his personal bodyguard organization, the Red Guard. The Office of the Supreme Chancellor is given power equaling that of the Senate. The Galactic Senate also meets less often, as the Chancellor is voted more emergency powers to act on his own during the time of crisis. Eventually, many Outer Rim planets and companies leave the Republic due to the amount of corruption and unfair treatment to Outer Rim worlds. Together, they form a rebellion known as the Confederacy of Independent Systems, almost exclusively referred to in the films as the Separatists. Some large industrial companies, including the Trade Federation, side with the Separatists, providing them with their military and its resources. =Galactic politicians= Politicians include Senators, the Supreme Chancellor, the Vice Chair of the Senate, the Administrative Aide, various Representatives from systems, and to an unofficial extent, the members of the Jedi Council. Jedi Council members hold special status as they appear to have the ability to watch Senate meetings and advise such Senators on various matters. The Jedi order protects these people. Palpatine and the Jedi The Jedi with the most authority served on the Jedi Council, among whom Yoda and Mace Windu act as de facto leaders at the height of the Republic. Although the Senate holds some degree of political authority over the Jedi, very little pressure was ever put on the Council before Palpatine took office and demands that Anakin Skywalker become a member of the Council, despite the misgivings of the Jedi. While the council allows Anakin to be on the council, they do not grant him the status of a Jedi master. Republic Military While the Republic had an Army and Navy for thousands of years, after the Rusaan Reformations, the Republic does not maintain a military except for a small force known as the Judicial Forces. Several trade organizations represented in the Senate, such as the Trade Federation and Commerce Guild, keep armies of droids to protect their profits and occasionally take advantage of this, such as when the Trade Federation invade and occupy Naboo. Individual sectors also maintain their own security forces, such as Naboo Security Force or the CorSec from Corellia, and these are sometimes used to combat small threats. However, there is no centralized and official military of the Republic. The Trade Federation and other cartels within the Republic desire that the Republic government lack significant central military power. The Clone Wars changes all this. The threat of the Confederacy of Independent Systems poses a huge threat to the Republic after some of the galaxy's large companies ally with it. A Military Creation Act is proposed, strongly opposed by many of the Republic's pacifist leaders, such as Padm√© Amidala of Naboo, who fear the possibility of war. But most of the Senate supports a permanent, official, and central military. Supporters of the Act include Orn Free Taa of Ryloth and Ask Aak of Malastare. However, a Clone Army had already been created in secret on the planet Kamino on the edge of the galaxy ten years earlier, commissioned by Master Sifo-Dyas in secret, a former Jedi perceiving chaos in the galaxy. When it becomes clear the Confederacy has no intention of negotiating, the Republic quickly accepts the Army made for them, and it is dubbed the Grand Army of the Republic. Despite the high quality of their armaments and cloned troops, the Republic's war effort is initially hindered because most of the major industrial companies in the Galaxy have, under the aegis of the Techno Union, sided with the Confederacy. Eventually, though, the Republic becomes a humongous superpower not only economically but also militarily. The rapid militarization of the Republic during the Clone Wars, overseen by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, has far reaching effects. The Confederacy wins most battles in the first year of the Clone Wars. During the second and middle year of the Clone Wars however, the Republic defends itself from Confederate attacks and retaliates with its own assaults, many of which are successful. During the third and final year of the Clone Wars, the Republic wins many offensive battles in the Mid Rim and pushes the Confederate forces back to the Outer Rim with its \\"Outer Rim Sieges\\" campaign. End of the Republic During the Clone Wars, the Senate increasingly grants enormous amounts of power to Palpatine, who is the Commander-in-Chief. Such actions are justified in the name of security and are considered a perfectly reasonable way to increase the wartime government's efficiency. Eventually, Palpatine gains enough political power that he and his office are equal to the Senate. Tension between Palpatine and the Jedi grow as the war progresses. Many members of the Jedi Council remain skeptical of Palpatine's growing power. In time, the Jedi believe that Palpatine will not surrender his emergency powers and his long overdue position by the end of the war. This suspicion is also shared by some senators, including Padm√© Amidala of Naboo, Bail Organa of Alderaan, and Mon Mothma of Chandrila. After the death of Separatist leaders Count Dooku, who was the Head of State, and General Grievous, who was the Commander of the Separatist Army, and the discovery that Palpatine is actually Darth Sidious, the Jedi activate their contingency plans. The Sith are the ancient enemy of the Jedi and were thought to have been destroyed many years ago. A small group of experienced Jedi led by Mace Windu fail to arrest Palpatine for treason when Anakin Skywalker pledges himself to the dark side. Shortly afterwards, Palpatine secretly orders the clones to exterminate the Jedi Order. Because of control chips implanted inside the clones' heads, the clones are forced to slaughter the Jedi leaders in what would later become known as the Jedi Purge. The Jedi remaining on Coruscant are eliminated by Darth Vader, formerly known as Anakin Skywalker, and his personal battalion. As the Clone Wars enter its final year, Palpatine's once near-unanimous support begins to falter. As depicted in the Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith novelization and deleted scenes from the film itself, a bloc of senators began to emerge, even before the Clone Wars end, who oppose Palpatine's authoritarian rule and resent his treatment of the Jedi and other opponents. This bloc, originally led by influential politicians such as Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and later by Bail's adopted daughter Princess Leia Organa, eventually become the political voice of the emerging Rebel Alliance. At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Palpatine addresses the Senate. He relates the story of an unsuccessful \\"assassination attempt\\" on his life by the Jedi. Claiming that it is a \\"rebellion\\" and that their next move would be to kill all the Senators, he declares the order to be enemies of the Republic. Palpatine announces that the Galactic Republic will be reorganized into the Galactic Empire, and he will be the emperor for life. Deluded by Palpatine's charisma and skill (and perhaps also by his considerable dark side power), the majority of the Senate cheer him on loudly in approval. The official continuation of the Galactic Republic is the Galactic Empire, which is fueled by cruelty and fear. The New Republic After the end of the Galactic Empire, the New Republic was founded. It was enforced by the original Rebellion, eventually known as the New Republic Military. The New Republic is depicted in the new Star Wars series, The Mandalorian. The New Republic is eventually destroyed by the First Order, under Supreme Leader Snoke's direction.

In prosody, alliterative verse is a form of verse that uses alliteration as the principal ornamental device to help indicate the underlying metrical structure, as opposed to other devices such as rhyme. The most commonly studied traditions of alliterative verse are those found in the oldest literature of the Germanic languages, where scholars use the term 'alliterative poetry' rather broadly to indicate a tradition which not only shares alliteration as its primary ornament but also certain metrical characteristics. The Old English epic Beowulf, as well as most other Old English poetry, the Old High German Muspilli, the Old Saxon Heliand, the Old Norse Poetic Edda, and many Middle English poems such as Piers Plowman, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and the Alliterative Morte Arthur all use alliterative verse. Alliterative verse can be found in many other languages as well. The Finnish Kalevala and the Estonian Kalevipoeg both use alliterative forms derived from folk tradition. Traditional Turkic verse, for example that of the Uyghur, is also alliterative. Common Germanic origins and features The copies of the Golden Horns of Gallehus exhibited at the National Museum of Denmark. The poetic forms found in the various Germanic languages are not identical, but there is sufficient similarity to make it clear that they are closely related traditions, stemming from a common Germanic source. Knowledge about that common tradition, however, is based almost entirely on inference from later poetry. One statement we have about the nature of alliterative verse from a practicing alliterative poet is that of Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda. He describes metrical patterns and poetic devices used by skaldic poets around the year 1200. Snorri's description has served as the starting point for scholars to reconstruct alliterative meters beyond those of Old Norse. There have been many different metrical theories proposed, all of them attended with controversy. Looked at broadly, however, certain basic features are common from the earliest to the latest poetry. Alliterative verse has been found in some of the earliest monuments of Germanic literature. The Golden horns of Gallehus, discovered in Denmark and likely dating to the 4th century, bear this Runic inscription in Proto-Norse: x / x x x / x x / x / x x ek hlewagasti Ä holtija Ä  horna tawid≈ç (I, Hlewagasti Ä [son?] of Holt, made the horn.) This inscription contains four strongly stressed syllables, the first three of which alliterate on /x/ and the last of which does not alliterate, essentially the same pattern found in much later verse. Originally all alliterative poetry was composed and transmitted orally, and much went unrecorded. The degree to which writing may have altered this oral art form remains much in dispute. Nevertheless, there is a broad consensus among scholars that the written verse retains many (and some would argue almost all) of the features of the spoken language. =Metrical form= The core metrical features of traditional Germanic alliterative verse are as follows; they can be seen in the Gallehus inscription above:Terasawa, Jun. Old English Meter: An Introduction (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 3-26. * A long line is divided into two half-lines. Half-lines are also known as 'verses', 'hemistichs', or 'distichs'; the first is called the 'a-verse' (or 'on- verse'), the second the 'b-verse' (or 'off-verse'). The rhythm of the b-verse is generally more regular than that of the a-verse, helping listeners to perceive where the end of the line falls. * A heavy pause, or 'c√¶sura', separates the verses. * Each verse usually has two heavily stressed syllables, referred to as 'lifts' or 'beats' (other, less heavily stressed syllables, are called 'dips'). * The first (and, if there is one, sometimes the second) lift in the a-verse alliterates with the first lift in the b-verse. * The second lift in the b-verse does not alliterate with the first lifts. Some of these fundamental rules varied in certain traditions over time. Unlike in post- medieval English accentual verse, in which a syllable is either stressed or unstressed, Germanic poets were sensitive to degrees of stress. These can be thought of at three levels: # most stressed ('stress-words'): root syllables of nouns, adjectives, participles, infinitives # less stressed ('particles'): root syllables most finite verbs (i.e. verbs which are not infinitives) and adverbs # even less stressed ('proclitics'): most pronouns, weakly stressed adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, parts of the verb to be, word-endings If a half-line contains one or more stress-words, their root syllables will be the lifts. (This is the case in the Gallehus Horn inscription above, where all the lifts are nouns.) If it contains no stress-words, the root syllables of any particles will be the lift. Rarely, even a proclitic can be the lift, either because there are no more heavily stressed syllables or because it is given extra stress for some particular reason. If a lift was occupied by word with a short root vowel followed by only one consonant followed by an unstressed vowel (i.e. '(-)CVCV(-)) these two syllables were in most circumstances counted as only one syllable. This is called resolution.Jun Terasawa, Old English Metre: An Introduction (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 31-33. The patterns of unstressed syllables vary significantly in the alliterative traditions of different Germanic languages. The rules for these patterns remain imperfectly understood and subject to debate. =Rules for alliteration= Alliteration fits naturally with the prosodic patterns of early Germanic languages. Alliteration essentially involves matching the left edges of stressed syllables. Early Germanic languages share a left-prominent prosodic pattern. In other words, stress falls on the root syllable of a word, which is normally the initial syllable (except where the root is preceded by an unstressed prefix, as in past participles, for example). This means that the first sound of a word was particularly salient to listeners. Traditional Germanic verse also had two particular rules about alliteration: * All vowels alliterate with each other.Minkova, Donka. Alliteration and Sound Change in Early English, Cambridge Studies in Linguistics, 101 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), ch. 4. * The consonant clusters st-, sp- and sc- are treated as separate sounds (so st- only alliterates with st-, not with s- or sp-).Minkova, Donka. Alliteration and Sound Change in Early English, Cambridge Studies in Linguistics, 101 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), chs 5-7. The precise reasons for this are debated. The most common, but not uniformly accepted, theory for vowel-alliteration is that words beginning with vowels all actually began with a glottal stop (as is still the case in some modern Germanic languages). =Diction= The need to find an appropriate alliterating word gave certain other distinctive features to alliterative verse as well. Alliterative poets drew on a specialized vocabulary of poetic synonyms rarely used in prose texts and used standard images and metaphors called kennings. English alliterative verse =Old English poetic forms= Old English classical poetry, epitomised by Beowulf, follows the rules of traditional Germanic poetry outlined above, and is indeed a major source for reconstructing them. J.R.R. Tolkien's essay \\"On Translating Beowulf\\" analyses the rules as used in the poem.Tolkien, 1983. Some patterns of classical Old English verse begin to break down at the end of the Old English period. Moreover, Thomas Bredehoft has argued that an alternative system of non- classical Old English poetry with looser constraints existed alongside this classical verse. In Bredehoft's reading, this poetry is epitomized by the homilies of √Ülfric of Eynsham traditionally described as being in 'rhythmical prose'.Bredehoft, Thomas A. '√Ülfric and Late Old English Verse', Anglo-Saxon England, 33 (2004), 77‚Äì107; Thomas A. Bredehoft, Early English Metre (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005). This section of the article, however, focuses on the classical form.  Metrical form  As described above for the Germanic tradition as a whole, each line of poetry in Old English consists of two half-lines or verses with a pause or caesura in the middle of the line. Each half-line usually has two accented syllables, although the first may only have one. The following example from the poem The Battle of Maldon, spoken by the warrior Beorhtwold, shows the usual pattern: Clear indications of Modern English meanings can be heard in the original, using phonetic approximations of the Old English sound-letter system: [Hige] shall the harder,  heart the keener, mood shall the more,  as our main [might] littleth In addition to the rules outlined above, Old English poetry had constraints limiting the lengths of verses and the number and distribution of lifts and dips. However, there is still no consensus on what precisely the constraints were, and they must have varied slightly from one poem to another. The most widely used system for classifying Old English prosodic patterns is based on that developed by Eduard Sievers and extended by Alan Joseph Bliss.Sievers, Eduard. Altgermanische Metrik, Sammlung kurzer Grammatiken germanischer Dialekte. Erg√§nzungsreihe. 2 (Halle: Niemeyer, 1893); Bliss, Alan Joseph . The metre of 'Beowulf' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1958); Jun Terasawa, Old English Metre: An Introduction (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 34-48. Sievers' system is a method of categorization rather than a full theory of meter. It does not, in other words, purport to describe the system the scops actually used to compose their verse, nor does it explain why certain patterns are favored or avoided. Sievers divided verses into five basic types, labeled A‚ÄìE. The system is founded upon accent, alliteration, quantity of vowels, and patterns of syllabic accentuation. Another popular system is that of Geoffrey Russom, which is predicated on a theory of meter involving two metrical feet per verse.Russom, Geoffrey. Old English Meter and Linguistic Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987); Beowulf and Old Germanic Metre, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 23 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). Cf. Thomas A. Bredehoft, Early English Metre (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005). Another is that of Thomas Cable, which is based on the idea that each verse contains four syllables, with specific rules for the addition of extra unstressed syllables.Cable, Thomas. The English Alliterative Tradition (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991); Alaric Hall and Sheryl McDonald, A Beginner's Guide (Hopefully) to Old English Metre (version 1.4, January 28th 2011) http://www.alarichall.org.uk/teaching/alliteration/OE/index.php. Rules for alliteration Alliteration is the principal ornamental feature of Old English poetry. Two stressed syllables alliterate when they begin with the same sound. In addition to the general rules for alliteration in Germanic poetry listed above, there are some further complications due to sound-changes in Old English: * Unpalatized c (pronounced ) alliterated with palatized c (pronounced in late Old English), apparently because the sounds were once just one sound ().Minkova, Donka. Alliteration and Sound Change in Early English, Cambridge Studies in Linguistics, 101 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 116-18. * Unpalatized g (pronounced ) likewise alliterated with palatized g (pronounced like y in yet, , in late Old English) and with the g inherited from Common Germanic . There is not yet a consensus on why these alliterated, but must be partly because the first two gs were once just one sound. The first stressed syllable of the off-verse, or second half-line, usually alliterates with one or both of the stressed syllables of the on- verse, or first half-line. The second stressed syllable of the off-verse does not usually alliterate with the others. =The Middle English 'alliterative revival'= Just as rhyme was seen in some Anglo-Saxon poems (e.g. The Rhyming Poem, and, to some degree, The Proverbs of Alfred), the use of alliterative verse continued into Middle English. Layamon's Brut, written in about 1215, uses a loose alliterative scheme. Starting in the mid-14th century, alliterative verse became popular in the English North, the West Midlands, and a little later in Scotland. The Pearl Poet uses a complex scheme of alliteration, rhyme, and iambic metre in his Pearl; a more conventional alliterative metre in Cleanness and Patience, and alliterative verse alternating with rhymed quatrains in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. William Langland's Piers Plowman is an important English alliterative poem; it was written between c. 1370 and 1390. The form of alliterative verse changed gradually over time. From Piers Plowman: A feir feld full of folk  fond I √æer bitwene, Of alle maner of men,  √æe mene and √æe riche, Worchinge and wandringe  as √æe world aske√æ. In modern spelling: A fair field full of folk  found I there between, Of all manner of men  the mean and the rich, Working and wandering  as the world asketh. In modern translation: Among them I found a fair field full of people All manner of men, the poor and the rich Working and wandering as the world requires. Alliteration was sometimes used together with rhyme in Middle English work, as in Pearl and in the densely structured poem The Three Dead Kings. Middle English alliterative poets invented some innovative structures; the Pearl Poet, for instance, often adds a third alliterating word to the first half-line (e.g. Sir Gawain l.2, \\"the borgh brittened and brent  to brondez and askez\\"), and the medial pause is not always strictly maintained. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a well- known alliterative poem in Middle English (from original manuscript, artist unknown). After the fifteenth century, alliterative verse became fairly uncommon; possibly the last major poem in the tradition is William Dunbar's Tretis of the Tua Marriit Wemen and the Wedo (c. 1500). By the middle of the sixteenth century, the four-beat alliterative line had completely vanished, at least from the written tradition: the last poem using the form that has survived, Scotish Feilde, was written in or soon after 1515 for the circle of Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby in commemoration of the Battle of Flodden. =Modern revival= Tolkien J. R. R. Tolkien (1892‚Äì1973), a scholar of Old and Middle English, used alliterative verse extensively in both translations and original poetry. Most of his alliterative verse is in modern English, in a variety of styles, but he also composed Old English alliterative verses. Tolkien also wrote alliterative verse based on other traditions, such as the V√∂lsungasaga and Atlakvi√∞a, in The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun (2009), and The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son describing the aftermath of the Battle of Maldon (1953). His Gothic Bagme Bloma (\\"Flower of the Trees\\") uses a trochaic metre, with irregular end-rhymes and irregular alliteration in each line; it was published in Songs for the Philologists (1936). He wrote a variety of pieces of alliterative verse in Old English, including parts of The Seafarer A version of these appears in The Notion Club Papers. He also made translations including about 600 lines of Beowulf in verse. The 2276-line The Lay of the Children of H√∫rin (c. 1918-1925), published in The Lays of Beleriand (1985) is written in Modern English (albeit with some archaic words) and set to the Beowulf meter. Lines 610-614 are given here: 'Let the bow of Beleg to your band be joined; and swearing death to the sons of darkness let us suage our sorrow and the smart of fate! Our valour is not vanquished, nor vain the glory that once we did win in the woods of old.' Lewis Alliterative verse is occasionally written by other modern authors. C. S. Lewis (1898‚Äì1963) wrote a narrative poem of 742 lines called The Nameless Isle, published posthumously in Narrative Poems (1972). Lines 562‚Äì67: The marble maid, under mask of stone shook and shuddered. As a shadow streams Over the wheat waving, over the woman's face Life came lingering. Nor was it long after Down its blue pathways, blood returning Moved, and mounted to her maiden cheek. Auden W. H. Auden (1907‚Äì1973) wrote a number of poems, including The Age of Anxiety, in a type of alliterative verse modified for modern English. The noun-laden style of the headlines makes the style of alliterative verse particularly apt for Auden's poem: Now the news. Night raids on Five cities. Fires started. Pressure applied by pincer movement In threatening thrust. Third Division Enlarges beachhead. Lucky charm Saves sniper. Sabotage hinted In steel-mill stoppage. . . . Wilbur Richard Wilbur's Junk opens with the lines: An axe angles from my neighbor's ashcan; It is hell's handiwork, the wood not hickory. The flow of the grain not faithfully followed. The shivered shaft rises from a shellheap Of plastic playthings, paper plates. Other poets who have experimented with modern alliterative English verse include Ezra Pound in his version of \\"The Seafarer\\". Many translations of Beowulf use alliterative techniques. Among recent ones that of Seamus Heaney loosely follows the rules of modern alliterative verse while the translations of Alan Sullivan and Timothy Murphy follow those rules more closely. Old Norse poetic forms The inherited form of alliterative verse was modified somewhat in Old Norse poetry. In Old Norse, as a result of phonetic changes from the original common Germanic language, many unstressed syllables were lost. This lent Old Norse verse a characteristic terseness; the lifts tended to be crowded together at the expense of the weak syllables. In some lines, the weak syllables have been entirely suppressed. From the H√°vam√°l: The various names of the Old Norse verse forms are given in the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson. The H√°ttatal, or \\"list of verse forms\\", contains the names and characteristics of each of the fixed forms of Norse poetry. =Fornyr√∞islag= The Fyrby Runestone tells in fornyr√∞islag that two brothers were \\"the most rune-skilled brothers in Middle Earth.\\" A verse form close to that of Beowulf existed in runestones and in the Old Norse Eddas; in Norse, it was called fornyr√∞islag, which means \\"past- words-law\\" or \\"way of ancient words\\". The Norse poets tended to break up their verses into stanzas of from two to eight lines (or more), rather than writing continuous verse after the Old English model. The loss of unstressed syllables made these verses seem denser and more emphatic. The Norse poets, unlike the Old English poets, tended to make each line a complete syntactic unit, avoiding enjambment where a thought begun on one line continues through the following lines; only seldom do they begin a new sentence in the second half- line. This example is from the Waking of Angantyr: Fornyr√∞islag has two lifts per half line, with two or three (sometimes one) unstressed syllables. At least two lifts, usually three, alliterate, always including the main stave (the first lift of the second half-line). It had a variant form called m√°lah√°ttr (\\"speech meter\\"), which adds an unstressed syllable to each half- line, making six to eight (sometimes up to ten) unstressed syllables per line. Conversely, another variant, kvi√∞uh√°ttr, has only three syllables in its odd half-lines (but four in the even ones).Poole, Russell. 2005. Metre and Metrics. In: McTurk, Rory (ed.). A Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature. P.267-268 =Lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr= Change in form came with the development of lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr, which means \\"song\\" or \\"ballad metre\\", a stanzaic verse form that created four line stanzas. The odd numbered lines were almost standard lines of alliterative verse with four lifts and two or three alliterations, with c√¶sura; the even numbered lines had three lifts and two alliterations, and no c√¶sura. This example is from Freyr's lament in Sk√≠rnism√°l: A number of variants occurred in lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr, including galdralag (\\"incantation meter\\"), which adds a fifth short (three-lift) line to the end of the stanza; in this form, usually the fifth line echoes the fourth one. =Dr√≥ttkv√¶tt= The copper Sigtuna box with a dr√≥ttkv√¶tt verse written with the runic alphabet The Karlevi Runestone contains a dr√≥ttkv√¶tt poem in memory of a chieftain. These verse forms were elaborated even more into the skaldic poetic form called dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, meaning \\"courtly metre\\",Clunies Ross, Margaret. 2005. A History of Old Norse Poetry and Poetics. P. 21 which added internal rhymes and other forms of assonance that go well beyond the requirements of Germanic alliterative verse and greatly resemble the Celtic forms (Irish and Welsh). The dr√≥ttkv√¶tt stanza had eight lines, each having usually three lifts and almost invariably six syllables. Although other stress patterns appear, the verse is predominantly trochaic. The last two syllables in each line had to form a trocheeClunies Ross, Margaret. 2005. A History of Old Norse Poetry and Poetics. P. 23 (there are a few specific forms which utilize a stressed word at line-end, such as in some docked forms).Ringler, Dick (ed. and trans.). J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson: Selected Poetry and Prose (1998), ch. III.1.B 'Skaldic Strophes', http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/jonas/Prosody/Prosody-I.html#Pro.I.B In addition, specific requirements obtained for odd-numbered and even-numbered lines. In the odd-numbered lines (equivalent to the a-verse of the traditional alliterative line): * Two of the stressed syllables alliterate with one another. * Two of the stressed syllables share partial rhyme of consonants (which was called skothending) with dissimilar vowels (e.g. hat and bet), not necessarily at the end of the word (e.g. touching and orchard). In the even lines (equivalent to the b-verse of the traditional alliterative line): * The first stressed syllable must alliterate with the alliterative stressed syllables of the previous line. * Two of the stressed syllables rhyme (a√∞alhending, e.g. hat and cat), not necessarily at the end of the word (e.g. torching and orchard). The requirements of this verse form were so demanding that occasionally the text of the poems had to run parallel, with one thread of syntax running through the on-side of the half-lines, and another running through the off-side. According to the Fagrskinna collection of sagas, King Harald III of Norway uttered these lines of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; the internal assonances and the alliteration are emboldened: :Krj√∫pum v√©r fyr v√°pna, :(valteigs), br«´kun eigi, :(sv√° bau√∞ Hildr), at hjaldri, :(haldor√∞), √≠ bug skjaldar. :(H√°tt ba√∞ mik), √æar's m≈ìttusk, :(menskor√∞ bera for√∞um), :hlakkar √≠ss ok hausar, :(hjalmstall √≠ gn√Ω malma). : In battle, we do not creep behind a shield before the din of weapons [so said the goddess of hawk-land {a valkyrja} true of words.] She who wore the necklace bade me to bear my head high in battle, when the battle-ice [a gleaming sword] seeks to shatter skulls. The bracketed words in the poem (\\"so said the goddess of hawk-land, true of words\\") are syntactically separate, but interspersed within the text of the rest of the verse. The elaborate kennings manifested here are also practically necessary in this complex and demanding form, as much to solve metrical difficulties as for the sake of vivid imagery. Intriguingly, the saga claims that Harald improvised these lines after he gave a lesser performance (in fornyr√∞islag); Harald judged that verse bad, and then offered this one in the more demanding form. While the exchange may be fictionalized, the scene illustrates the regard in which the form was held. Most dr√≥ttkv√¶tt poems that survive appear in one or another of the Norse Sagas; several of the sagas are biographies of skaldic poets. =Hrynhenda= Hrynhenda is a later development of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt with eight syllables per line instead of six, with the similar rules of rhyme and alliteration, although each hrynhent-variant shows particular subtleties. It is first attested around 985 in the so-called Hafger√∞ingadr√°pa of which four lines survive (alliterants and rhymes bolded): :M√≠nar bi√∞k at munka reyni :meinalausan farar beina; :hei√∞is haldi h√°rar foldar :hallar dr√≥ttinn of m√©r stalli. : I ask the tester of monks (God) for a safe journey; the lord of the palace of the high ground (God ‚Äî here we have a kenning in four parts) keep the seat of the falcon (hand) over me. The author was said to be a Christian from the Hebrides, who composed the poem asking God to keep him safe at sea. (Note: The third line is, in fact, over-alliterated. There should be exactly two alliterants in the odd-numbered lines.) The metre gained some popularity in courtly poetry, as the rhythm may sound more majestic than dr√≥ttkv√¶tt. We learn much about these in the Hattatal:Hattatal, Snorri Sturluson Snorri gives for certain at least three different variant-forms of hryniandi. These long-syllabled lines are explained by Snorri as being extra-metrical in most cases: the \\"main\\" form never has alliteration or rhyme in the first 2 syllables of the odd-lines (i.e., rimes always coming at the fourth-syllable), and the even-lines never have rhyme on the fifth/sixth syllables (i.e.: they cannot harbor rime in these places because they extra-metrical), the following couplet shows the paradigm: Tiggi sn√Ωr √° √≥gnar √°ru (Undgagl veit √æat) s√≥knar hagli. [Note the juxtaposition of alliteration and rhyme of the even-line] Then, the variant- forms show unsurprising dr√≥ttkv√¶tt patterns overall; the main difference being that the first trochee of the odd-lines are technically not reckoned as extrametrical since they harbor alliteration, but the even-lines' extra- metrical feature is more or less as the same. The 2nd form is the \\"troll- hryniandi\\": in the odd-lines the alliteration is moved to the first metrical position (no longer \\"extra-metrical\\") while the rhyme remains the same (Snorri seems to imply that frumhending, which is placing a rhyme on the first syllable of any line, is preferably avoided in all these forms: the rhymes are always preferred as oddhending, \\"middle-of-the-line rhymes\\") ‚Äî in the even- lines the rhyme and alliteration are not juxtaposed, and this is a key feature of its distinction (the significant features only are marked in bold below): St√°la kendi steykvilundum Styriar valdi raudu falda.... The next form, which Snorri calls \\"ordinary/standard hrynhenda\\", is almost like a \\"combination\\" of the previous ‚Äî alliteration always on the first metrical-position, and the rimes in the odd-lines juxtaposed (all features in bold in this example): Vafdi l√≠tt er virdum m√¶tti V√≠gr√¶kiandi fram at s'√¶kia.' There is one more form which is a bit different though seemed to be counted among the previous group by Snorri, called draughent. The syllable-count changes to seven (and, whether relevant to us or not, the second-syllable seems to be counted as the extra- metrical): V√°pna hr√≠d velta n√°di V√¶gdarlaus feigum hausi. Hilmir l√©t h√∂ggum m√¶ta Herda klett bana verdant. As one can see, there is very often clashing stress in the middle of the line (V√°pna hr√≠d velta....//..V√¶gdarlaus feigum...., etc.), and oddhending seems preferred (as well as keeping alliterative and rhyming syllables separated, which likely has to do with the syllabic-makeup of the line). =Post-medieval Scandinavian alliterative verse= Alliterative poetry is still practiced in Iceland in an unbroken tradition since the settlement, most commonly in the form of r√≠mur.Cf. . The most common alliterative r√≠ma form is ferskeytt.V√©steinn √ìlason, 'Old Icelandic Poetry', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, Histories of Scandinavian Literature, 5 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006), pp. 1-63 (pp. 55-59). High German and Saxon forms The Old High German and Old Saxon corpus of Stabreim or alliterative verse is small. Fewer than 200 Old High German lines survive, in four works: the Hildebrandslied, Muspilli, the Merseburg Charms and the Wessobrunn Prayer. All four are preserved in forms that are clearly to some extent corrupt, suggesting that the scribes may themselves not have been entirely familiar with the poetic tradition. Two Old Saxon alliterative poems survive. One is the reworking of the four gospels into the epic Heliand (nearly 6000 lines), where Jesus and his disciples are portrayed in a Saxon warrior culture. The other is the fragmentary Genesis (337 lines in 3 unconnected fragments), created as a reworking of Biblical content based on Latin sources. However, both German traditions show one common feature which is much less common elsewhere: a proliferation of unaccented syllables. Generally these are parts of speech which would naturally be unstressed - pronouns, prepositions, articles, modal auxiliaries - but in the Old Saxon works there are also adjectives and lexical verbs. The unaccented syllables typically occur before the first stress in the half-line, and most often in the b-verse. The Hildebrandslied, lines 4‚Äì5: The Heliand, line 3062: :S√¢lig bist thu S√Æmon, qua√∞ he, sunu Ionases; ni mahtes thu that selbo gehuggean ::Blessed are you Simon, he said, son of Jonah; for you did not see that yourself (Matthew 16, 17) This leads to a less dense style, no doubt closer to everyday language, which has been interpreted both as a sign of decadent technique from ill- tutored poets and as an artistic innovation giving scope for additional poetic effects. Either way, it signifies a break with the strict Sievers typology. In more recent times, Richard Wagner sought to evoke old German models and what he considered a more natural and less over-civilised style by writing his Ring poems in Stabreim.

One of the composer's most celebrated works, the Eroica symphony is a large-scale composition that marked the beginning of Beethoven's creative middle period.The Symphony, ed. Ralph Hill, Pelican Books (1949), p. 99.Symphony No. 6 in F Major, Op. 68 Pastorale (Schott), ed. Max Unger, p. vi. Composed mainly in 1803‚Äì1804, the work was instrumental in breaking the boundaries of form, length, harmony, and perceived emotional and possibly cultural content. It has therefore widely been considered an important landmark in the transition between the Classical and the Romantic era. It is also often considered to be the first Romantic symphony.  Instrumentation  Symphony No. 3 is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B, two bassoons, three horns (the 1st in E, C, and F; the 2nd in E and C; and the 3rd in E), two trumpets in E and C, timpani in E and B (in the 1st, 3rd, and 4th movements) and in C and G (in the 2nd movement), and strings.  Form  The work is in four movements: Depending upon the conductor's style and observation of the exposition repeat in the first movement, the performance time is between 41 and 56 minutes. = I. Allegro con brio = The first movement, in time, is in sonata form, with typical performances between 12 and 18 minutes long depending on interpretation and whether the exposition repeat is played. Unlike the longer introductions in Beethoven's first two symphonies, the movement opens with two large E major chords, played by the whole orchestra, that establish the tonality of the movement. The conductor Kenneth Woods has noted that the opening movement of Eroica has been inspired by and modeled on Mozart's Symphony No. 39, and shares many attributes of that earlier symphony which predates this one by a decade and a half.Explore the Score ‚Äì Beethoven: Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Opus 55, Sinfonica eroica, Kenneth Woods, 27 January 2016  Exposition  The exposition begins with the cellos introducing the first theme. By the fifth bar of the melody (m. 7), a chromatic note (C) is introduced, thus introducing the harmonic tension of the work. The melody is finished by the first violins, with a syncopated series of Gs (which forms a tritone with C of the cellos). The first theme is then played again by the various instruments. The modulation to the dominant key of B appears early (mm. 42‚Äì44).Cooper, Barry, Beethoven (Oxford University Press 2008) In the traditional analysis, this is followed by three (or in some views, two) transitional subjects that significantly expand the scale of the exposition ‚Äì a lyrical downward motif (mm. 45‚Äì56), an upward scale motif (mm. 57‚Äì64), and a section beginning with rapid downward patterns in the violins (mm. 65‚Äì82). This eventually leads to a lyrical second theme (m. 83) that arrives \\"unusually late\\". After this, the second half of the theme eventually builds to a loud melody (m. 109) that draws upon the earlier downward motif (m. 113). The climactic moment of the exposition arrives when the music is interrupted by six consecutive sforzando chords (mm. 128‚Äì131). Later, and following the concluding chords of the exposition (mm. 144‚Äì148), the main theme returns in a brief codetta (m. 148) that transitions into the repeat / development. An alternative analysis holds that the second theme begins earlier at m. 45 with the downward motif. In this view, the traditional harmonic progression of the exposition ends at m. 82, with the new lyrical theme at m. 83 beginning an extension. This pattern would be consistent with that found later in the development, in which the climactic moment leads to a new lyrical theme that launches an extended section. Moreover, the downward motif theme (m. 45) is developed significantly in the next section while the lyrical theme (m. 83) does not appear.Sipe, Thomas, Beethoven: Eroica Symphony (Cambridge University Press 1998) Commenters have also observed that the sonata form and orchestration transitions would be fully preserved by cutting the second half of the exposition (m. 83‚Äì143). However, others have observed that form and orchestration would also be fully preserved if the second and third transitional passages were cut instead (mm. 57‚Äì82), consistent with the traditional analysis.  Development  The development section (m. 154), like the rest of the movement, is characterized by harmonic and rhythmic tension from dissonant chords and long passages of syncopated rhythm. Following various thematic explorations and counterpoint, the music eventually breaks into a 32-bar passage (mm. 248‚Äì279) of sforzando chords including both 2-beat and 3-beat downward patterns, culminating in crashing dissonant forte chords (mm. 276‚Äì279). Commenters have stated that this \\"outburst of rage ... forms the kernel of the whole movement\\", and Beethoven reportedly got out in his beat when conducting the orchestra in Christmas 1804, forcing the confused players to stop and go back. Rather than leading to the recapitulation at this point, a new theme in E minor is then introduced instead (mm. 284). This eventually leads to a near-doubling of the development's length, in like proportion to the exposition. Ferdinand Ries (1784‚Äì1838), Beethoven's friend, pupil, and secretary At the end of the development, one horn famously appears to come in early with the main theme in E (mm. 394‚Äì395), while the strings continue playing the dominant chord. In the 19th century, this was thought to be a mistake; some conductors assumed the horn notes were written in the tenor clef (B‚ÄìD‚ÄìB‚ÄìF) while others altered the second violin harmony to G (chord of the tonic), an error that eventually appeared in an early printed version. However, Beethoven's secretary, Ferdinand Ries, shared this anecdote about that horn entrance: > The first rehearsal of the symphony was terrible, but the hornist did, in > fact, come in on cue. I was standing next to Beethoven and, believing that > he had made a wrong entrance, I said, \\"That damned hornist! Can't he count? > It sounds frightfully wrong.\\" I believe I was in danger of getting my ears > boxed. Beethoven did not forgive me for a long time.  Recapitulation and coda  The recapitulation section features a sudden excursion to F major early on before eventually returning to a more typical form. The movement concludes in a long coda that reintroduces the new theme first presented in the development section. = II. Marcia funebre. Adagio assai = The second movement is a funeral march in the ternary form (A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA) that is typical of 18th-century funeral marches,Roden, Timothy J.; Wright, Craig; and Simms, Bryan R., Anthology for Music in Western Civilization, Vol. 2 (Schirmer 2009) albeit one that is \\"large and amply developed\\" and in which the principal theme has the functions of a refrain as in rondo form.Lockwood, Lewis, Beethoven's Symphonies ‚Äì An Artistic Vision (W. W. Norton & Company, New York 2015) Musically, the thematic solemnity of the second movement has lent itself for use as a funeral march, proper. The movement is between 14 and 18 minutes long. The opening A-section in C minor begins with the march theme in the strings, then in the winds. A second theme (m. 17) in the relative major (E) quickly returns to minor tonality, and these materials are developed throughout the rest of the section. This eventually gives way to a brief B-section in C major (m. 69) \\"for what may be called the Trio of the March\\", which Beethoven unusually calls attention to by marking \\"Maggiore\\" (major) in the score. At this point, the traditional \\"bounds of ceremonial propriety\\" would normally indicate a da capo return to the A theme. However, the first theme in C minor (m. 105) begins modulating in the sixth bar (m. 110), leading to a fugue in F minor (m. 114) based on an inversion of the original second theme. The first theme reappears briefly in G minor in the strings (m. 154), followed by a stormy development passage (\\"a shocking fortissimo plunge\\"). A full re-statement of the first theme in the original key then begins in the oboe (m. 173). The coda (m. 209) begins with a marching motif in the strings that was earlier heard in the major section (at mm. 78, 100) and eventually ends with a final soft statement of the main theme (m. 238) that \\"crumbles into short phrases interspersed with silences\\". = III. Scherzo. Allegro vivace - Trio = The third movement is a lively scherzo with trio in rapid time. It is between 5 and 6 minutes long. The A theme of the outer scherzo section appears pianissimo in the dominant key of B (mm. 7, 21), then piano in the secondary dominant key of F which is when the B part of the outer scherzo is heard (m. 41). This is followed by a pianissimo restart in B (m. 73), which is when the A theme is heard again, leading to a full fortissimo statement in the tonic key of E (m. 93). Later, a downward arpeggio motif with sforzandos on the second beat is played twice in unison, first by the strings (mm. 115‚Äì119) and then by the full orchestra (mm. 123‚Äì127). This is followed by a syncopated motif characterized by descending fourths (m. 143), leading to the repeat. The trio section features three horns, the first time this had appeared in the symphonic tradition. The scherzo is then repeated in shortened form, except that very notably the second occurrence of the downward unison motif is changed to duple time (mm. 381‚Äì384). The movement ends with a coda (m. 423) ‚Äì with Beethoven marking the word in the score which was unusual for him ‚Äì that quickly builds from pianissimo to fortissimo, encapsulating the pattern of the whole movement. = IV. Finale. Allegro molto - Poco Andante - Presto = The fourth movement is a set of ten variations on a theme. It lasts between 10 and 14 minutes. The theme was previously used by Beethoven in earlier compositions and arguably forms the basis for the first three movements of the symphony as well (see Thematic Origins below). After a short introduction on the tutti that begins with the mediant chord that transitions to the dominant seventh, the quiet theme, in E-flat major, first appears and then is subjected to a series of ten variations: Variation 1: The first variation repeats the theme in \\"arco\\" while a new accompaniment is introduced. (E-flat major) Variation 2: The next variation, containing a new triplet accompaniment, leads to: (E-flat major) Variation 3: Where a new melody is introduced while the theme is still played on the bass. A brief transitional passage leads to: (E-flat major) Variation 4: In C minor, a fugue that starts quietly and suspensefully on the strings as it builds up to a dramatic and urgent climax. (See Beethoven and C minor.) Variation 5: The playful fifth variation is in D major, involving a statement of the theme where the bass instruments play the first clause of the first half in a minor mode, before correcting themselves and moving to the major for the second clause. The variation also includes two virtuosic solo passages for the flute which accompany the melodic line. This directly leads to: Variation 6: A stormy and raging variation in G minor, reminiscent of a gypsy dance. Variation 7: An incomplete variation, which begins with a simple restatement of the first half of the theme in C major, before an almost immediate switch back to the minor mode in order to bring the piece into: Variation 8: Another fugue, now it is bright and energized, as this time it is in the tonic (E-flat major) instead of the submediant. It builds up to a climax again; the orchestra pauses on the dominant of the home key, and the theme is further developed in: Variation 9: At this point, the tempo slows down to Poco Andante, and the piece becomes more serene and tranquil. The theme, first stated by an oboe and then by the strings, here is contemplative and wistful, bringing a greater sense of depth to what has been heard before. During the second half, another triplet accompaniment is introduced in the higher strings, while the melodies, played by the woodwinds, are made of syncopated 16th and 8th notes. (E-flat major) Variation 10: The final variation, which is when the \\"full image\\" of The Eroica is heard. Triumphant and heroic plunges are constantly heard on the tutti, with the triplet accompaniment from the previous variation still present, as the melody from the third variation, now victorious and energized, is heard on the brass. (E-flat major) The symphony ends with a coda, which takes image on all previous sections and variations of the movement. At the end of the coda, there is a surprise, which is when the dynamic changes from pp on the flute and strings only to ff all of a sudden by a huge crash on the whole orchestra, as the tempo abruptly changes from Poco Andante to Presto. A flurry of sforzandos appear, and the finale ends with three large E-flat major chords on the tutti, marked ff.  History  Beethoven began composing the third symphony soon after Symphony No. 2 in D major, Opus 36 and completed the composition in early 1804. The first public performance of Symphony No. 3 was on 7 April 1805 in Vienna. = Thematic origins = Beethoven, circa 1803, when he wrote Symphony No. 3 There is significant evidence that the Eroica, perhaps unlike Beethoven's other symphonies, was constructed back-to-front. The theme used in the fourth movement, including its bass line, originate from the seventh of Beethoven's 12 Contredanses for Orchestra, WoO 14,Beethoven, Ludwig van Beethoven's Werke, Serie 2: Orchester-Werke, No. 17a, 12 Contret√§nze (Leipzig, Breitkopf & H√§rtel 1864), available on IMSLP (visited 20 May 2017 and also from the Finale to his ballet The Creatures of Prometheus, Op. 43, both of which were composed in the winter of 1800‚Äì1801. The next year, Beethoven used the same theme as the basis for his Variations and Fugue for Piano in E‚ô≠ Major, Op. 35, now commonly known as the Eroica Variations due to the theme's re-use in the symphony. It is the only theme that Beethoven used for so many separate works in his lifetime, and each use is in the same key of E major. The \\"Wielhorsky Sketchbook\\", Beethoven's principal sketchbook for 1802, contains a two-page movement plan in E major that directly follows the sketches for the Opus 35 Variations, which has been identified as being intended for the Third Symphony.Fishman, Nathan (ed.), Kniga eskizov Beethovena za 1802‚Äì1803, 3 vols. (Moscow 1962). Citation based on unpaginated translation available at AllThingsBeethoven.com, \\"A translation of Nathan Fishman's analysis of the sketches for the Third Symphony contained in the Wielhorsky sketchbook\\" (visited 20 May 2017). While the movement plan gives no explicit indication regarding the finale, Lewis Lockwood argues that \\"there cannot be any doubt that Beethoven intended from the start\\" to use the same theme (and bass of the theme) that he had just fleshed out in the Opus 35 Variations. Thus, it is argued that Beethoven's initial conception for a complete symphony in E ‚Äì including its first three movements ‚Äì emerged directly from the Op. 35 Variations. The first movement's main theme (mm. 2‚Äì6) has thus been traced back to the bass line theme of the Opus 35 variations (E, B‚Üì, B‚Üë, E) by way of intermediate versions found in one of Beethoven's sketchbooks. In the second movement, the combined tonality (melody and bass) of the Opus 35 theme's first four bars ‚Äì E, B‚Üì, B7(A)‚Üë, E ‚Äì appears in slightly altered form as the funeral's march's second theme (E, B‚Üì, A‚Üë, E) (mvt. II, mm. 17‚Äì20), followed by two sudden forte Bs that echo later elements of the theme. That same tonality then appears unaltered as the scherzo's main theme (mvt. III, mm. 93‚Äì100). Thus, the first three movements can be viewed as symphonic-length \\"variations\\" on the Opus 35 theme, ultimately anticipating the theme's appearance in the fourth movement. Moreover, Beethoven's choice to begin the symphony with a theme adapted from the bass line is also paralleled in the fourth movement, in which the bass theme is heard as the first variation before the main theme ultimately appears. This again parallels the structure of the Opus 35 variations themselves. Finally, the loud E chord that begins the Opus 35 variations themselves is moved here to the beginning of the first movement, in the form of the two chords that introduce the first movement. Alternatively, the first movement's resemblance to the overture to the comic opera Bastien und Bastienne (1768), composed by twelve-year-old W. A. Mozart, has been noted. It was unlikely that Beethoven knew of that unpublished composition. A possible explanation is that Mozart and Beethoven each coincidentally heard and learned the theme from elsewhere.Gutman, Robert W., Mozart: A Cultural Biography, 1999, p. 242 = Dedication = Bonaparte, First Consul, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres Beethoven originally dedicated the third symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, who he believed embodied the democratic and anti-monarchical ideals of the French Revolution. In the autumn of 1804, Beethoven withdrew his dedication of the third symphony to Napoleon, lest it cost him the composer's fee paid him by a noble patron; so, Beethoven re-dedicated his third symphony to Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowitz ‚Äì nonetheless, despite such a bread-and-butter consideration, the politically idealistic Beethoven titled the work \\"Buonaparte\\". Later, about the composer's response to Napoleon having proclaimed himself Emperor of the French (14 May 1804), Beethoven's secretary, Ferdinand Ries said that: > In writing this symphony, Beethoven had been thinking of Buonaparte, but > Buonaparte while he was First Consul. At that time Beethoven had the highest > esteem for him, and compared him to the greatest consuls of Ancient Rome. > Not only I, but many of Beethoven's closer friends, saw this symphony on his > table, beautifully copied in manuscript, with the word \\"Buonaparte\\" > inscribed at the very top of the title-page and \\"Ludwig van Beethoven\\" at > the very bottom ... I was the first to tell him the news that Buonaparte had > declared himself Emperor, whereupon he broke into a rage and exclaimed, \\"So > he is no more than a common mortal! Now, too, he will tread under foot all > the rights of Man, indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself > superior to all men, become a tyrant!\\" Beethoven went to the table, seized > the top of the title-page, tore it in half and threw it on the floor. The > page had to be recopied, and it was only now that the symphony received the > title Sinfonia eroica.Eroica, Napoleon Series. An extant copy of the score bears two scratched-out, hand-written subtitles; initially, the Italian phrase Intitolata Bonaparte (\\"Titled Bonaparte\\"), secondly, the German phrase Geschriben auf Bonaparte (\\"Written for Bonaparte\\"), four lines below the Italian subtitle. Three months after retracting his initial Napoleonic dedication of the symphony, Beethoven informed his music publisher that \\"The title of the symphony is really Bonaparte\\". In 1806, the score was published under the Italian title Sinfonia Eroica ... composta per festeggiare il sovvenire di un grande Uomo (\\"Heroic Symphony, Composed to celebrate the memory of a great man\\").Dahlhaus, Carl. Ludwig van Beethoven: Approaches to His Music. Clarendon Press, 1991, pp. 23‚Äì25. = Early performances and reviews = Composed from the autumn of 1803 until the spring of 1804, the earliest rehearsals and performances of the third symphony were private, and took place in the Vienna palace of Beethoven's noble patron, Prince Lobkowitz. An account record dated 9 June 1804, submitted by the prince's Kapellmeister Anton Wranitzky, shows that the prince hired twenty-two extra musicians (including the third horn required for the Eroica) for two rehearsals of the work.Account record currently on display in the exhibition at the Lobkowicz Palace, Prague. The fee paid to Beethoven by Prince Lobkowitz would also have secured further private performances of the symphony that summer on his Bohemian estates, Eisenberg (Jeze≈ô√≠) and Raudnitz (Roudnice). The first public performance was on 7 April 1805, at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna; for which concert the announced (theoretical) key for the symphony was Dis (D major, 9 sharps).Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom, ed. Reviews of the work's public premiere (on 7 April 1805) were decidedly mixed. The concert also included the premiere of a Symphony in E flat major by Anton Eberl (1765‚Äì1807) that received better reviews than Beethoven's symphony. One correspondent describes the first reactions to the Eroica: > Musical connoisseurs and amateurs were divided into several parties. One > group, Beethoven's very special friends, maintains that precisely this > symphony is a masterpiece.... The other group utterly denies this work any > artistic value ... [t]hrough strange modulations and violent transitions ... > with abundant scratchings in the bass, with three horns and so forth, a true > if not desirable originality can indeed be gained without much effort. > ...The third, very small group stands in the middle; they admit that the > symphony contains many beautiful qualities, but admit that the context often > seems completely disjointed, and that the endless duration ... exhausts even > connoisseurs, becoming unbearable to the mere amateur. To the public the > symphony was too difficult, too long ...

One reviewer at the premiere wrote that \\"this new work of B. has great and daring ideas, and ... great power in the way it is worked out; but the symphony would improve immeasurably if B. could bring himself to shorten it, and to bring more light, clarity, and unity to the whole.\\"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 7, \\"Vienna, 9 April\\" (1 May 1805): 501‚Äì02, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 17 Another said that the symphony was \\"for the most part so shrill and complicated that only those who worship the failings and merits of this composer with equal fire, which at times borders on the ridiculous, could find pleasure in it\\".Berlinische musikalische Zeitung, vol. 1, \\"Miscellaneous News, Vienna, 2 May 1805\\" (1805): 174, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 18 But a reviewer just two years later described the Eroica simply as \\"the greatest, most original, most artistic and, at the same time, most interesting of all symphonies\\".Journal des Lulus und der Modern, vol. 23, \\"On Permanent Concerts in Leipzig during the Previous Semiannual Winter Season\\" (1807), reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, pp. 35‚Äì36. The finale in particular came in for criticism that it did not live up to the promise of the earlier movements. An early reviewer found that \\"[t]he finale has much value, which I am far from denying it; however, it cannot very well escape from the charge of great bizarrerie.\\"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 9, \\"News, Mannheim\\" (28 January 1807): 285‚Äì86, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 19. Another agreed that \\"[t]he finale pleased less, and that \\"the artist often wanted only to play games with the audience without taking its enjoyment into account simply in order to unloose a strange mood and, at the same time, to let his originality sparkle thereby\\".Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 9, \\"News, Prague\\" (17 June 1807): 610, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. vol. 2, p. 34. An exhaustive review of the work in a leading music journal made an observation that may still be familiar to first-time listeners: \\"this finale is long, very long; contrived, very contrived; indeed, several of [its] merits lie somewhat hidden. They presuppose a great deal if they are to be discovered and enjoyed, as they must be, in the very moment of their appearance, and not for the first time on paper afterwards.\\"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, vol. 9, \\"Review\\" (18 February 1807): 321‚Äì33, reprinted in translation in Senner et al. Vol. 2, p. 30. A review of an 1827 performance in London wrote that this particular performance \\"most properly ended with the funeral march, omitting the other parts, which are entirely inconsistent with the avowed design of the composition\\".The Harmonicon, vol. 5, pt. 1, p. 123, \\"Review of Royal Academic Concert on 30 April 1827\\" (1827), available on Google Books (visited 21 May 2017). The symphony premiered in London on 26 March 1807 at the Covent Garden Theatre and in Boston on 17 April 1810 by the newly founded Boston Philharmonic Society both performances receiving fairly mixed reviews. = Manuscripts and editions = The original autograph manuscript does not survive. A copy of the score with Beethoven's handwritten notes and remarks, including the famous scratch-out of the dedication to Napoleon on the cover page, is housed in the library of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. A first published edition (1806) of Beethoven's Eroica is on display at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague.This 1st ed. comprises 18 parts, and contains corrections made by Beethoven. Wien Kunst-u. Industrie- Comptoir, PN 512. Several modern scholarly editions have appeared in recent decades, including those edited by Jonathan Del Mar (published by B√§renreiter), Peter Hauschild (Breitkopf & H√§rtel), and Bathia Churgin (Henle).  Assessment  = Significance = The work is a milestone work in classical music; it is twice as long as the symphonies of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ‚Äì the first movement is almost as long as a Classical symphony (with repetition of the exposition). Thematically, it covers more emotional ground than Beethoven's earlier symphonies, and thus marks a key milestone in the transition between Classicism and Romanticism that would define Western art music in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The second movement especially displays a great emotional range, from the misery of the funeral march theme, to the relative solace of happier, major-key episodes. The finale displays a similar emotional range, and is given a thematic importance then unheard of. In earlier symphonies, the finale was a quick and breezy conclusion; here, the finale is a lengthy set of variations and a fugue.Bernstein, Leonard, The Infinite Variety of Music, Hal Leonard Corporation, = Critical opinions and phrases = * In the Treatise on Instrumentation and Orchestration (1844, 1855), Hector Berlioz discussed Beethoven's orchestral use and applications of the horn and of the oboe in this symphony.Eroica Symphony , Wi≈ødom Portal. * The critic J. W. N. Sullivan said that the first movement expresses Beethoven's courage in confronting deafness; the second movement, slow and dirge-like, communicates his despair; the third movement, the scherzo, is an \\"indomitable uprising of creative energy\\"; and the fourth movement is an exuberant outpouring of energy. * In Metamorphosen, Study for 23 Solo Strings (1945), Richard Strauss presents themes similar to the funeral march of the Sinfonia Eroica; near the conclusion of the Metamorphoses, the bass quotes the funeral march proper from the Sinfonia Eroica.

The Orchestre R√©volutionnaire et Romantique, conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner, performed the Eroica symphony in its entirety. The subject of the film is the private 1804 premiere of the work at the palace of Prince Lobkowitz (Jack Davenport). The film is based in part on Ferdinand Ries' recollections of the event. In the film Beethoven does not learn that Napoleon has crowned himself Emperor of France until after the performance of the symphony is over ‚Äì while having dinner with Ferdinand Ries. Rather than tearing up the title page of the symphony, he simply crumples it up.
