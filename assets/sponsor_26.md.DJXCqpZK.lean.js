Trust instruments are generally only used in relation to an inter vivos trust; testamentary trusts are usually created under a will.Although not always. It is possible for the deceased to convey property to trustees upon death which perfects a trust. See also secret trusts. Formalities Although in most legal systems there are certain formalities associated with settling a trust, most legal systems impose few, if any, structures on the trust instrument itself. Historically, the concept of a trust is the intervention of the courts of equity to prevent a legal owner treating the property as beneficially his own; provided that state of affairs exists, a trust arises notwithstanding any lack of formality in relation to the form of the trust instrument. However, notwithstanding the flexible approach taken by the law, characteristically the legal profession has taken an extremely formalised approach to trust instruments. Not only are they invariably always executed under seal as a deed, but frequently the initial trust fund (usually a nominal amount), will actually be physically affixed to the trust instrument itself to prove that the initial trust property was transferred.The substantial trust fund is usually added later by a deed of addition. Some slightly unusual practices have arisen in relation to the drafting of trust instruments which, again, are rigidly adhered to by professionals in many common-law countries (although not the U.S.A.). For example, trust deeds will generally avoid all punctuation (including full stops) - to avoid confusion, all new sentences commence with a new, numbered, paragraph. Dates, including years, are conventionally spelled out in words rather than using figures. Part of the over-formalisation which attends the creation of trusts is justified by the significant tax implications which may follow if a trust were to be subsequently held to be void, as most professionally drafted trust instruments are prepared as a part of tax mitigation schemes. Most jurisdictions do not require trust instruments to be publicly filed (in contrast to wills). But in many jurisdictions they are subject to stamp duty. Provisions The provisions of a trust instrument will vary according to the type of trust, and the nature of the trust property. *A bare trust over a single asset will characteristically have very few provisions. *A discretionary trust over a mixed bag of investments will usually have far greater provisions regulation the exercise and management of the trust fund. *A trust which is set up as a unit trust will have additional specific provisions specific to the calculation of the NAV and acquisition and redemption of units. *Settled land act settlements have specific provisions relating to the underlying subject matter. *Trusts which are set up to protect vulnerable beneficiaries, such as blind trusts or spendthrift trusts will have specific provisions relating to the nature of the beneficiaries. However, in general, most trust instruments will have provisions which address the following aspects of the administration of the trust: #The name of the settlement and definitions and interpretation provisions #The legal nature of the trust (i.e. a trust for sale) #Powers to add and exclude beneficiaries #Trusts over property added to the trust fund #Power of appointment (i.e. distribution) #Trusts in default of appointment, and, sometimes, ultimate default trusts #General administrative powers of the trustees #Extended power of maintenance #Extended power of advancement #Usually, a trustee charging clause #Regulation of the appointment of new trustees #The proper law and forum and place of administration for the settlement #Often, an exclusion of settlor (and spouse) from benefiting from the trust (where required for tax reasons) #Usually, an indemnity for the trustees out of the trust fund Most trust instruments will then also have two schedules: #a schedule setting out the powers of the trustees (often in addition to any powers granted or implied by operation of law) #a summary of the initial trust fund (usually a nominal amount of money) See also *Asset-protection trust *Back-bond in Scotland *Blind trust *Express trust *Inter vivos trust *Offshore trust *Protective trust *Spendthrift trust *Testamentary trust *Unit trust Footnotes Equity (law) Property law Wills and trusts Legal terminology ","title":"Trust instrument"},{"id":"5728873","text":"FC La Chaux-de-Fonds is a Swiss football club based in La Chaux-de-Fonds.

The team was forced to move on three occasions, changing names as part of these moves, so the AMES name applies only to the period between 1936 and 1939. Although used as a name by the team itself only briefly, the AMES acronym became the basis for naming Royal Air Force radar systems through the war. The same numbering sequence was used after the war as well, but often dropped the AMES from the name. A good example is the Type 80, which was officially AMES Type 80, but often appears without that marque. Many post-war systems were also assigned a rainbow code and are better known by that name. The AMES numbering scheme was often ad hoc, with some entries simply being other sets operating together. For instance, the Type 21 was simply a Type 13 and Type 14 in a single vehicle convoy. In other cases Types differ only in minor details, like the Type 31 through 34, which are the same radars mounted in various ways.

Having been divided twice, it no longer has all of Maryland and now consists of the central, northern, and western Maryland counties of Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Harford, Howard, and Washington, as well as the independent city of Baltimore. History The Diocese of Maryland is one of the nine original dioceses of the Episcopal Church and traces its roots to 1608 when Captain John Smith oversaw the first Christian worship in the upper Chesapeake Bay. In 1692, a law passed by the province's general assembly established the Church of England and the colony, which was divided into ten counties, was divided into 30 parishes (See List of the original 30 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland). Sometimes the parish church was centrally located; other times multiple churches or chapels served distant population centers within the parish. In 1780, a meeting in Chestertown, Maryland, in Kent County at Washington College of Anglican clergy and laity led to the formation of the Diocese of Maryland. By 1783, at the end of the American Revolution, the developing diocese had 47 parishes and about 38 clergy (See List of post 1692 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland). In 1789, the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America was founded. The diocese's first bishop, Thomas John Claggett (1743-1816), was the first American bishop of the Episcopal Church consecrated in the country, in 1792 at Trinity Church facing historic Wall Street in New York City. Among notable historical events in the diocese is the first African-American Episcopal congregations in the South, St. James' Church, at Lafayette Square, in west Baltimore. Another first among Maryland's bishops was the election of John Gardner Murray as Presiding Bishop. He was the first elected primate of the Episcopal Church; for his predecessors, the senior member of the House of Bishops, automatically assumed the position. The diocese has been divided twice. First in 1868, the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland became the Diocese of Easton, causing the Diocese of Maryland to no longer have all of Maryland. Then in 1895, the District of Columbia and adjacent (and increasingly suburban) Montgomery and Prince George's, along with southern Maryland's Charles and St. Mary's counties became the Diocese of Washington. On March 29, 2008, Eugene Taylor Sutton was elected as the 14th bishop of the diocese;\\"Maryland elects Eugene Sutton as 14th bishop\\" Episcopal News Service, March 29, 2008 the first African-American to serve in that capacity was consecrated June 28, 2008. In 2014, Heather Cook was the first woman elected to become a bishop in the diocese and she was consecrated as suffragan to Sutton.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-05-03/news/bs-md-bishop- elected-20140503_1_episcopal-diocese-woman-bishop-top-bishop However, she was placed on administrative leave at the end of 2014 after involvement in a traffic fatality in north Baltimore.http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/north- baltimore/bs-md-episcopal-cathedral-20150104-story.html Cook was charged with drunk driving, texting while driving, and leaving the scene of the crime, in addition to vehicular manslaughter.Baltimore Brew website. On January 22, 2015, the standing committee of the diocese requested that Cook resign her position. This was followed by the Presiding Bishop, Katharine Jefferts Schori, placing formal restrictions on Cook preventing her from presenting herself as an ordained minister of the Episcopal Church. On May 1, 2015, Jefferts Schori announced that both she and the Diocese of Maryland had accepted Cook's resignation as a bishop and as an employee of the diocese. Moreover, both parties reached an accord where Cook received a \\"Sentence of Disposition\\" which stripped Cook of her ordained status. The Diocese of Maryland currently has 117 congregations (12 are missions, 10 are parishes and the rest are separate congregations), and membership of more than 44,200.

There is a bend in the lane about halfway along, following the boundaries of the surrounding colleges. The lane is largely surrounded by high stone walls with few windows, but with some good examples of gargoyles, a feature of Oxford college architecture. At the north-western end, the lane continues as New College Lane, named after New College to the north of Queen's Lane. There is a barrier in the road at this point to prevent through traffic.

It was established in 1948 by seven countries bordering the river, replacing previous commissions that had also included representatives of non-riparian powers. Its predecessor commissions were among the first attempts at internationalizing the police powers of sovereign states for a common cause. Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Serbia. The commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856, which established for the first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the Danube, and of 1921, which resurrected the international regime after the First World War.CONVENTION REGARDING THE REGIME OF NAVIGATION ON THE DANUBE Duties Flag of the Danube Commission in Budapest, April 2008 The commission meets regularly twice a year. It also convenes groups of experts to consider items provided for in the commission's working plans. Its primary duties are: *Supervising the implementation of the international convention that set it up in 1948. *Preparing a general plan of the main works called for in the interest of navigation. *Consulting with and making recommendations to the special administrations charged with various stretches of the river and exchanging information with them. *Establishing a uniform system of traffic regulations on the whole navigable portion of the Danube and, taking into account the specific conditions of various sections of the river, laying down the basic provisions governing navigation on the Danube, including those governing a pilot service. *Unifying the regulations governing river, customs and sanitary inspection. *Harmonizing regulations on inland navigation with the European Union and with the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine. *Coordinating the activity of hydro-meteorological services on the Danube and publishing short-term and long-term hydrologic forecasts for the river. *Collecting statistical data on aspects of navigation on the Danube within the commission's competence. *Publishing reference works, sailing directions, nautical charts and atlases for purposes of navigation. Organization The commission elects from among its members a president, vice-president and secretary for three-year terms. Serving since 2008 are Igor Savolsky of the Russian Federation, Ern≈ë Keskeny of Hungary, and Dmytro Tkach of Ukraine. The commission has a secretariat of 11 international civil servants and 19 employees under the supervision of a director-general, who is at present Manfred Seitz from Austria. The official languages of the commission are German, French and Russian. The Danube River History As a result of the Danube River Conference of 1948, the river system was divided into three administrations: the regular River Commission (which had existed in one form or another since 1856), a bilateral Romania‚ÄìUSSR administration between BrƒÉila and the mouth of the Sulina channel, and a bilateral Romania‚ÄìYugoslavia administration at the Iron Gate. Both of the latter were technically under the control of the main commission, members of which were ‚Äì at the beginning ‚Äì Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, the USSR, and Yugoslavia. =The Cominform rift= When the treaty was adopted, Yugoslavia had already been expelled from the Cominform, the political grouping of all the Communist parties in the Soviet bloc. Yet it still voted down the line with the other non-Western countries, nearly 200 miles of the Danube flowing through its territory and the only navigable channel through the Iron Gate being on the Yugoslav side of the Romanian border. Nevertheless, when the new commission organized its staff, the Yugoslavs were offered only four minor posts out of sixty permanent appointments. The Josip Broz Tito government refused them all.New York Times, June 22, 1952, p. 21 The commission also fixed freight rates that allegedly discriminated against Yugoslavia, Belgrade officials said. Faced with this situation, > the Yugoslav delegate to the commission has been most uncooperative. He has > been a minority of one on every major question that has come up for > discussion. He opposed, for example, the creation of a special > administration fluviale [river administration] run by a joint > Czechoslovak‚ÄìHungarian Commission to control the difficult Gabcikovo‚ÄìGunyu > sector‚Ä¶ The Yugoslavs lost by six votes to one.

At the session of November 11, 1949, a Soviet proposal was adopted vesting complete powers of appointment, organization, leadership, and negotiation in the secretary, who was the Russian representative. By 1950, > the Soviet government [had] assumed complete control over the Commission's > administrative machinery and reduced the other governments to nominal > status‚Ä¶ Yugoslav representatives [had] been excluded from every important > committee.New York Times, June 25, 1953, p.11 At the May 1951 meeting, the Yugoslavs walked out, forcing adjournment. They were protesting the \\"railroading\\" of shipping regulations they thought would hurt their economy: a rule forbidding inspection of foreign ships by the nations through which they were passing. The Yugoslavs charged sabotage and infiltration by Soviet agents aboard the ships. In August, Yugoslavia told the USSR in a note that the commission's rules were \\"contrary in letter and spirit\\" to the 1948 convention, giving the Soviets control of the waterway in violation of national sovereignty. At the commission's fifth session, in June 1952, Yugoslavia proposed the establishment of an executive committee to be composed of one representative from each country; it would control business between formal sessions of the commission. The Soviet bloc voted to study the plan \\"sometime between the sixth and seventh sessions.\\"New York Times, June 5, 1953, p. 6 Next, Yugoslavia proposed that the top posts should be rotated among the six members every three years, but the commission rejected that suggestion in June 1953. Rumors sprang up that Yugoslavia would resign from the commission because of this treatment.New York Times, June 25, 1953, p. 11 Slowly, though, the picture changed with a thaw in Yugoslav‚ÄìSoviet relations. On December 15, 1953, Dragoje Djuric, a Yugoslav diplomat, was elected to the secretary's post, a Hungarian was named president and a Bulgarian vice president.New York Times, December 16, 1953, p. 8 A Belgrade spokesman said in glee that the sessions were unusually harmonious because the Iron Curtain countries were agreeing to \\"all proposals put on the agenda by the Yugoslavs,\\" one of them being a Yugoslav‚ÄìHungarian proposal to move the commission's headquarters from Galatz to Budapest.New York Times, December 17, 1953, p. 8 Later, though, the Soviet bloc intimated the downgrading of the Danube Commission. A Vienna dispatch reported that the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Eastern European equivalent of the Marshall Plan, had created a new, permanent Danube committee of its own, its purpose to draft measures for using Danube water for power, irrigation, and navigation. It ordered at a Moscow meeting that plans be made to raise the level of the river by dams so seagoing ships could move farther upstream.New York Times, September 2, 1956, p. 26 =East‚Äìwest detente= After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 the Danube Commission became less politicized, and multilateral, technical cooperation began to develop, concentrating on three tasks: Improving navigation, developing hydroelectric power, and building a trans-European waterway system.\\"Danube Traffic Doubled,\\" The Times (London), October 13, 1960, cited in Charles Andras, \\"Neighbors on the Danube,\\" Radio Free Europe Research, December 1967 In addition, the commission was used as a way to test several innovations in Soviet foreign policy: *An attempt to appease and renew relations with Yugoslavia. *A switch from bilateral relations within the Soviet bloc, especially in technical areas. *A restoration of closer, nonpolitical relations with the West.David T.

It is a more extreme form of Irish republicanism, which denotes rejection of all British rule in Ireland. The concept shapes aspects of, but is not synonymous with, abstentionism. Historical development Republican legitimists adopt a traditional Irish republican analysis that views the Irish Republic as proclaimed \\"in arms\\" during the 1916 Easter Rising as the sole legitimate authority on the island of Ireland. This view is partly shared by all political parties in the present-day Republic of Ireland, who believe the secessionist and abstentionist First D√°il, which \\"ratified\\" the Republic proclaimed in 1916, is a predecessor to the current, internationally recognised, D√°il, the lower house of the Irish Parliament. It is on the issue of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty that republican legitimism departs from mainstream constitutional understanding. It views the Anglo-Irish Treaty as incompatible with the Irish Republic and thus null and void. Although the Treaty was endorsed by the majority of TDs of the Second D√°il, republican legitimists argue that the vote was invalid as all TDs had, prior to their election, taken a solemn oath to defend the Irish Republic, and that people could not possibly express their true desires on the treaty, as the British had threatened a massive escalation, \\"immediate and terrible war\\" as they phrased it, if it was not accepted. On the basis of these views, republican legitimism argued that: * all Irish parliaments convened since the Second D√°il in 1921 are illegitimate as they were established by a piece of British legislation, the Government of Ireland Act 1920This applies directly in the case of the Third D√°il; by proxy of the Constitution of the Irish Free State enacted by the third D√°il in the cases of the fourth to Ninth D√°ils; and by proxy of both the Constitution of the Irish Free State and the current Constitution of Ireland enacted by the ninth D√°il for the tenth and all subsequent D√°ils. * The First D√°il passed a resolution which provided that if enemy action ever succeeded in preventing the D√°il from functioning democratically, the Army should have the power to proclaim an Emergency Government; * the 64 TDs who voted for the Treaty in 1922 had violated their oath to the Irish Republic and abdicated their legitimacy; * The Second D√°il had never formally dissolved itself. The pro- and anti-treaty factions of Sinn F√©in attempted to present a united block of candidates for the 1922 general election in the 26 counties for the Third D√°il; 58 pro-treaty Sinn F√©in members were re-elected compared with 36 anti- treaty members. Of these, 17 of the 58 and 16 of the 36 were returned unopposed. Following the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, the Second D√°il was never dissolved. Led by √âamon de Valera and others, the Second D√°il TDs who had voted against the Treaty abstained from the (26 county) Provisional Parliament of the Free State and the subsequent Oireachtas of the Irish Free State. They and their opponents engaged in the Irish civil war in 1922-23. Although de Valera had resigned as President of the Republic on 7 January 1922, and had not been re-elected on a very close D√°il vote two days later, a meeting of the IRA Army Executive at Poulatar, Ballybacon on 17 October 1922 adopted a proclamation \\"reinstating\\" de Valera as \\"President of the Republic\\" and \\"Chief Executive of the State\\". The \\"Emergency Government,\\" as de Valera called it in his autobiography, was established on 25 October 1922.√âamonn de Bhail√©ara (Eamon de Valera) entry on Archontology.org websiteThe World at War ‚Äì Ireland Timeline 1918‚Äì1948 claims the meeting was held on 26 October. Another source claims the meeting that meeting was held on 9 September 1922. Members of this Republican government were:Tim Pat Coogan, De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow (Hutchinson, London, 1993).. * √âamon de Valera - \\"President of the Republic\\" (after his arrest in 1923, substituted by Patrick J. Ruttledge) *Robert Barton - \\"Minister for Economic Affairs\\" *Liam Mellows - \\"Minister for Defence\\" *Se√°n T. O'Kelly - \\"Minister for Local Government\\" *Patrick J. Ruttledge - \\"Minister of Home Affairs\\" *Austin Stack - \\"Minister of Finance\\" De Valera also appointed twelve members of the Second D√°il to act as a Council of State. They were: *Robert Barton (who had signed the Treaty) - chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation from 1934‚Äì1954 *Michael Colivet - did not join Fianna F√°il as he refused to take the Oath of Allegiance *Laurence Ginnell (died 1923) *Mary MacSwiney - signed 1938 statement *Se√°n Moylan (joined Fianna F√°il in 1926) *Kathleen O'Callaghan *Se√°n √ì Ceallaigh (John J. O'Kelly) - signed 1938 statement *Se√°n T. O'Kelly (helped to found Fianna F√°il in 1926) *Se√°n O'Mahony (remained with Sinn F√©in after the 1926 split-died 1934) *Count Plunkett - signed 1938 statement *P. J. Ruttledge (helped to found Fianna F√°il in 1926) *Austin Stack (remained with Sinn F√©in after the 1926 split-died 1929) This \\"Government of the Republic\\", however, was unable to assert the authority it claimed to possess. Effectively an internal government-in-exile, one of its first acts was to rescind the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It continued to meet even after subsequent elections had been held in jurisdiction of the Free State. Styling themselves Comhairle na dTeachta√≠, the members of the rump Second D√°il were joined by anti-Treaty republican TDs elected at subsequent elections. The IRA initially recognised the authority of the rump Second D√°il but increased distrust between the two bodies led the IRA to withdraw its support in 1925. At the 1926 Sinn F√©in Ard Fheis, √âamon de Valera (then president of the party) effectively called for the tactical abandonment of the legitimist argument by proposing that the party accept the Free State constitution and return to electoral politics contingent on the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown. Opponents of the proposal, led by Father Michael O'Flanagan and Mary MacSwiney,Maria Luddy, 'MacSwiney, Mary Margaret (1872‚Äì1942)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 defeated his motion by a vote of 223 to 218. De Valera subsequently resigned as Sinn F√©in president to form a new party, Fianna F√°il, which entered the D√°il of the Irish Free State in 1927, reducing the ranks of this rump Second D√°il even further. From this point onwards, de Valera and his followers were seen as having departed from the principles of republicanism by republican legitimists, who set up Comhairle na Poblachta as a body to popularise its claims. However, on 14 March 1929, de Valera made a remarkable statement in the Free State Parliament: \\"I still hold that our right to be regarded as the legitimate Government of this country is faulty, that this house itself is faulty - you have secured a de facto position.\\" He accused the Free State of having brought off a coup d'√©tat in the summer of 1922 and stated: \\"Those who have continued on in that organisation which we have left can claim exactly the same continuity that we claimed up to 1925. They can do it...\\" 1938 ‚Äì Second D√°il to Army Council  The adoption of the 1937 Constitution changed the name of the state from \\"Irish Free State\\" to \\"Ireland\\", but legitimists continued to use the obsolete \\"Free State\\" to refer derisively to the regime it considered illegitimate; a practice continued past the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 and down to the present day. The 17 December 1938 issue of the Wolfe Tone Weekly carried a statement from a body calling itself the Executive Council of the Second D√°il. Above this statement was an introductory paragraph written by Se√°n Russell announcing that on 8 December, the anniversary of the executions of the \\"Four Martyrs\\" (Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey) in 1922, the group had transferred what they believed was their authority as Government of the Irish Republic to the IRA Army Council. The statement was published in both Irish and English and appeared below the banner headline \\"IRA take over the Government of the Republic\\". The legalistic basis for this transfer of authority was a resolution of the First D√°il on 11 March 1921 in response to the arrest of many TDs during the IRA's war with British security forces. Rather than nominate substitute members, Plunkett had said \\"it was usual to substitute military dictatorship in countries invaded\\", and the D√°il decided that \\"when the number [of TDs] fell to five the Army [IRA] should take control\\" and \\"resolve itself into a Provisional Government\\". During the period 1922-1938, all seven signatories stood for re-election in the Irish Free State, but by 1938 none were successful. Therefore, they considered that their past electoral status in 1921-22 was more important than their subsequent attempts to be elected, as the Second D√°il arose from the last election held in the whole island of Ireland. The signatories now argued that the seven general elections that the Irish Free State electorate had voted in, from 1922 to mid-1938, had all been illegitimate and unconstitutional; even though they had themselves stood as candidates and had on occasion been elected in some of them. The text of the statement is as follows: Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. This allowed it to present its declaration of war on Britain in January 1939 (see S-Plan) as the act of a legitimate, de jure government. 1969 ‚Äì Official/Provisional split In December 1969, the IRA General Army Convention decided to drop its policy of abstentionism. This resulted in a split in the organisation, leading to the emergence of the (then) majority Official IRA and (minority) Provisional IRA. The supporters of the latter approached Tom Maguire, the last surviving member of the 1938 seven-member rump Second D√°il, who declared that the Provisional IRA was the legitimate successor to the 1938 Army Council and, as such, was the legal embodiment of the Irish Republic. The text of the statement is as follows: 1986 ‚Äì Provisional/Continuity split The Provisional Movement followed this analysis until 1986, when the IRA and Sinn F√©in split over the issue of abstentionism once again. As in 1970, republican legitimists approached Tom Maguire, who in two statements written in 1986 and 1987 but issued posthumously in 1994, maintained that the Army Council of the Continuity IRA was the sole legitimate successor to the 1938 Army Council.Maguire died in 1993 aged 101. The texts of the statements are as follows: And: In the years after the split, the Provisionals moved towards a complete cessationhttp://republican-news.org/archive/1997/July24/24iras.html of armed struggle, while Sinn F√©in entered constitutional politics. The party now contests elections to the D√°il √âireann and the Northern Ireland Assembly - \\"partitionist parliaments\\" in the legitimist view - and takes up the seats it wins. However, Sinn F√©in maintains an abstentionist stance towards the Westminster Parliament. Republican Sinn F√©in uphold the abstentionist tradition to both \\"partitionist parliaments\\" plus Westminster, and view themselves as the Sinn F√©in organisation founded in 1905.

His work includes various media, such as film, installations, performance, drawing, and text. Parreno focuses on expanding ideas of time and duration through his artworks and distinctive conception of exhibitions as a medium. Preferring projects to objects, he began examining unique approaches to narration and representation in the 1990s and has been exhibiting internationally ever since. Early life and education Parreno was born in Oran, in Algeria. From 1983 until 1988, he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Grenoble and at the Institute des hautes √©tudes en arts plastiques at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris from 1988 until 1989. Work Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto. Parreno has exhibited his works since the early 1990s and has been critically acclaimed ever since then. Parreno has worked collaboratively with other artists in all manner of media throughout his career. The concept of exhibitions and exhibition-making has been a central aspect for Parreno. For the artist, the exhibition is not a single work of art but a medium that offers endless possibility. Therefore, his exhibitions are mostly site-specific, as Parreno discloses in an interview for ArtReview: \\"What I generally do is so specific to the place that will hold the exhibition. I don't 'travel' shows. I find it impossible.\\"Art Review 67, no. 7 (October 2015), pp. 78-85; here p. 80. See also: \\"Philippe Parreno\\", in: Fondation Beyeler. The Collection, ed. by Theodora Vischer, Fondation Beyeler, Hatje Cantz 2017, . Apart from his extended concept of exhibitions, Parreno's artworks are concerned with the transformation of art genres, where is great diversity of used media plays a significant role. = Notable exhibitions and works = Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London 2016. Parreno has used his specific conception of exhibitions in his 2013 exhibition Anywhere, Anywhere Out Of The World where he radically transformed the monumental space of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Parreno turned the building itself into a living constantly evolving organism using sound, image and performance to guide the visitor on a journey through his works, both old and new. The exhibition was orchestrated along the lines of a dramatic composition where the spectral presence of objects, music, lights, and films guide and manipulated the visitor's experience transforming this monologue into a polyphony. In Dancing around the Bride in 2012 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art curated by Carlos Basualdo in collaboration with Erica F. Battle, Parreno acted as a metteur-en- sc√®ne (orchestrator), using the artworks of John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Marcel Duchamp to invoke time and motion. Sound was a key element in the 2013 exhibition, The Bride and The Bachelors, at the Barbican, London. The varied sequence of Parreno's subtle orchestration of live and pre-recorded sound from the works of Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp was arranged in concert with live dance performances, enabling the exhibition to change over time. During Art Basel, 2012, Parreno presented two major new works at Fondation Beyeler ‚Äì Marilyn (2012) and C.H.Z. (Continuously Habitable Zones) (2011). Marilyn was subsequently shown at Parreno's first solo exhibition in Russia at the Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, Moscow and at the 55th Venice Biennale at Fran√ßois Pinault's museum, Palazzo Grassi. H {N)Y P N(Y} OSIS, Parreno's first major U.S. exhibition, ran from June until August 2015 within the monumental interior of Park Avenue Armory‚Äôs Wade Thompson Drill Hall, New York and transformed the traditional exhibition experience through an interplay of film, sculpture, and the spectral presence of sound and light. Shortly after, in October 2015 until February 2016, Parreno presented Hypothesis, at HangarBicocca in Milan, his first survey exhibition in Italy. The show, curated by Andrea Lissoni, was inhabited by a series of key pieces together with recent works and music according to a mise en sc√®ne devised by Parreno. In October 2016 [until April 2017] Parreno undertook the Hyundai Commission for the Turbine Hall at London's Tate Modern. Entitled Anywhen , it was curated by Tate's Andrea Lissoni, Senior Curator, International Art (Film), with Vassilis Oikonomopoulos, Assistant Curator, it was the second annual Hyundai Commission, a series of site-specific works created for the Turbine Hall by renowned international artists. In December 2016 - March 2017 Parreno presented Thenabouts at ACMI in Melbourne, a retrospective of his films. In 2017 from 2 February - 7 May, Parreno exhibited A Time Coloured Space at the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto. Taking over the entire museum it featured some of Parreno's most well-known works, and new works for the exhibition. Later that year, from 7 July - 17 September 2017 at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai, Parreno presented Synchronicity.. From October 2017 - February 2018 Philippe Parreno: La levadura y el anfitri√≥n (The Yeast and The Host) was at Museo Jumex, Mexico City. Collaboration Collaboration is integral to Parreno's work. In June 2006, Universal released a feature-length documentary directed by Parreno and Scottish artist Douglas Gordon entitled Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which premiered out of competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Using 17 cameras, this unique football film follows legendary French midfielder Zinedine Zidane throughout an entire Real Madrid vs Villarreal match in front of 80,000 fans at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium. Two of the cameras were borrowed from the U.S. army and have the largest zoom available. The film tracks Zidane's every move on and off the ball, in the thick of the action. Subtitles includes the player's thoughts and observations on his playing career. The motion unfolds in a flow accentuated by an emotive original score by Scottish rock band, Mogwai. In 2007 Parreno directed and co- curated with Hans Ulrich Obrist, a group exhibition, Il Tempo del Postino (Postman Time) for the Manchester International Festival, which then showed at Art Basel, 2009. More than fifteen artists collaborated in this project including Doug Aitken, Matthew Barney & Jonathan Bepler, Tacita Dean, Trisha Donnelly, Olafur Eliasson, Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Douglas Gordon, Carsten H√∂ller, Pierre Huyghe, Koo Jeong-A, Philippe Parreno, Anri Sala, Tino Sehgal, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Thomas Demand, and Peter Fischli / David Weiss. In 2012 Parreno collaborated with artist Liam Gillick on To the Moon via the Beach . Shown at The Amphitheatre in Arles, this was a piece concerning work, production, and change, with the title reflecting its shifting nature and the promise of a journey. On entering the exhibition, visitors encountered an area covered in tons of sand. Over four days, this ‚Äòbeach‚Äô area was transformed by sand sculptors into a moonscape, which formed a constantly changing backdrop to a series of 22 artists‚Äô projects. The whole process was made visible with equal importance placed upon the production, presentation, and exchange of ideas. In 2014 Parreno was involved in a unique collaboration with a number of artists and curators, including Tino Sehgal, Liam Gillick, Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Asad Raza, and Pierre Boulez, for which he was also a curator. The exhibition Solaris Chronicles at the LUMA Foundation Arles Campus was presented in two phases and examined, through a series of artistic interventions and projects, the creative vision of architect Frank Gehry. Centred on large-scale models of many of Gehry's seminal works, the constantly shifting mise-en-sc√®ne created by the artists formed a bridge between art and architecture, transforming the usual relationship and collaborative processes between the two practices. In 2019, Parreno, Arca and Nicolas Becker used a generative music technology called Bronze to create a new work which will occupy the lobby of MoMA in New York for two years. 'Echo' is a site-specific work involving sound, light and animated physical objects. Described by the artist as an auto-poetic system, the work will exist in the space, responding to itself and its surroundings endlessly.

History Designed by Aston Webb & Ingress Bell of London after an open competition in 1886, assessed by architect Alfred Waterhouse, to provide the first assize courts in the rapidly growing town of Birmingham, it is faced entirely in deep red terracotta from the clay of Ruabon in North Wales and covered in intricate terracotta ornamentation. A statue of Queen Victoria by Harry Bates surmounts the main entrance. Other figures are by sculptor William Silver Frith to designs by Walter Crane. The rear of the building is less elaborately decorated. The foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria on 23 March 1887 in her Golden Jubilee year. Built by Birmingham firm John Bowen and Sons, the courts were opened on 21 July 1891 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. Additions were made adding a projecting bow window on the left in 1891‚Äì94 and extensions along Newton Street in 1914. The interior, including the Great Hall, is faced with sandy-yellow terracotta and intricate ornamentation. The terracotta used for the interior was produced by Gibbs and Canning Limited of Tamworth. The chandeliers in the great hall resemble Queen Victoria‚Äôs coronation crown and were the first outside London to be powered by electricity. Standing at the northern end of the shopping street, it is complemented by the similarly coloured Methodist Central Hall, which stands opposite. The site was previously occupied by Alaska Works and a small school. Future A proposal was made, prior to the 2010 UK General Election, to move the Magistrates' Court to a new purpose-built building nearby. This proposal was shelved, indefinitely, by the incoming coalition government led by David Cameron as Prime Minister, with Ken Clarke as the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (being the responsible Minister).

He soon started writing these novels also under the name of Sant≈ç Ky≈çden; several novels are labeled as written by Sant≈ç Ky≈çden and illustrated by Kitao Masanobu. He wrote kiby≈çshi and sharebon in great numbers, and became a popular writer. During this time he married twice, both his wives being licensed workers of Yoshiwara, the red-light district of Edo. During the Kansei Reforms, \\"[...] military and civil arts were encouraged, and the decadent writings of gesaku authors were condemned.\\" In 1791, Ky≈çden published three sharebon: , , and .

They play in the Swiss Challenge League, the second tier of Swiss football, and appeared regularly in the Nationalliga A during the 20th century. Their home is the Stadion Sch√ºtzenwiese. History Chart of FC Winterthur table positions in the Swiss football league system The club was founded in 1896 by students of the local school of engineering and following a fusion with two local teams, it was called Vereinigte Fussballclubs Winterthur between 1929 and 1946. They enjoyed their best success in the early part of the 20th century winning the Swiss Championship three times (in 1906, 1908 and 1917), before consecutive relegations in 1931 and 1934. They played in the lower leagues until regaining promotion to the Nationalliga B in 1950. They have since stayed in the second division for most of their history, except for several appearances in the Nationalliga A, from where they were most recently relegated in 1978 following a promotion ten years prior. Notable managers from this period include Gabet Chapuisat, Wolfgang Frank, Ren√© H√ºssy, Timo Konietzka, and Willy Sommer They famously lost to West Auckland F.C., an English amateur team in what is thought to be the first international football club competition, the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy. The club have also reached the final of the Swiss League Cup in 1972 and 1973 and Swiss Cup in 1968 and 1975, however lost on every occasion. In 2005‚Äì06 season the club finished 14th place in the Challenge League. Despite performing poorly in the league, they made it to the semi finals of the Swiss Cup by defeating Grasshoppers, Lucerne and Servette, before losing to eventual winners Sion at home. Players = Current Squad = = Former players = Stadium The club play at Stadion Sch√ºtzenwiese, a short walk from the centre of Winterthur, having done so since their inception in 1896. The first grandstand was built in 1922, and then replaced in 1957 using sponsorship money. In the 1980s the ownership was transferred to Winterthur council as the club faced financial problems. The council are responsible for any maintenance and upkeep. While once boasting a capacity of 14,987 before 2009, the stadium now holds 8,550 seats, 1,900 of which are seated. The more hardcore supporters of the club stand at one end, which is known as the Bierkurve. They also have a small stand for younger supporters known as the Syrupkurve. Away supporters are housed at the opposite end of the stadium to the Bierkurve.

It was covered by Christine Anu in 1995; she had been a backing vocalist in Neil Murray and The Rainmakers during 1992-1993\\\\. Warumpi Band version Neil Murray, lead vocalist and guitarist for Warumpi Band, recalls writing the song: It was first recorded in 1986 and released on the Warumpi Band's second album Go Bush by Parole Records in 1987. Rrurrumbu would later record a version of it in the Gumatj language for his debut solo album Nerbu Message. Christine Anu version In January 1995, Christine Anu released a version of the song as the second single from her debut studio album, Stylin' Up. Anu, a Torres Strait Islander, changed some lyrics to reflect her circumstances.Undercover \\"Christine Anu interview\\" e.g.: Rather than moving to the desert, she compares island life to the city life, and from the point of view of a woman. In the music video, it intercedes between her singing, and an Aboriginal man deciding to drop his job as a janitor, and start running through the city, the desert, and finally to the ocean. When he gets there, he swims to his home island and waves at his kid and wife. At the 1995 APRA Awards, \\"My Island Home\\" won Song of the Year. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, \\"Island Home\\" was nominated for ARIA Award for Song of the Year, but lost to \\"Chains\\" by Tina Arena. Despite peaking at number 67 on the Australian singles chart, it spent 20 weeks on the national top 100 chart. The song was voted at number 47 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1995. Anu performed the song at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics and at opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. The song was also listed in APRA Top 30 Australian songs of all time in 2001. Anu re-recorded the song for her second album Come My Way in 2001, subtitled \\"Earth Beat\\" version, which removed the echoed effects during the choruses, but added subtle synth effects and more prominent guitar during the song, making it sound more rhythmic and polished, whereas the original was driven more with a drum beat. In 2016, Anu's rendition was inducted into the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia.http://nfsa.gov.au/collection/sound/sounds-australia/2016-registry- additions/#christineanu In 2018, Anu performed the song at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. =Charts= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !

He lived primarily in Edo in the service of samurai, but also spent some time in Osaka as a townsman. He was among the most prolific writers of the late Edo period -- between 1795 and 1801 he wrote a minimum of twenty novels a year, and thereafter wrote , and over 360 illustrated stories, (, ÂêàÂ∑ª ). From Otsuriki, a funny book about how to make shadow pictures, 1810 Biography Little is known of Jippensha Ikku's adult life. He was married three times, two of which were quickly ended by fathers-in-law who could not understand his literary habits. The following anecdotes are told about him. He accepted poverty with good humor and, having no furniture, hung his bare walls with paintings of the furniture he might have had. On holidays he sacrificed to the gods with pictures of excellent offerings. Being presented with a bathtub in the common interest, he carried it home inverted on his head, and overthrew with ready wit the pedestrians who fell his way. When his publisher came to see him, Jippensha invited him to take a bath. While his invitation was being accepted he decked himself in the publisher's clothes and paid his New Year's Day calls in proper ceremonial costume. These anecdotes are now widely regarded as apocryphal.Translator's Preface to Hizakurige. Thomas Satchell. Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle Company. 1960. The most reliable sources cite Jippensha as being surly and unpleasant in person. His masterpiece, T≈çkaid≈çch≈´ Hizakurige, was published in twelve parts between 1802 and 1822. Aston calls it \\"the most humorous and entertaining book in the Japanese language.\\"'A history of Japanese literature'. W.G. Aston. New York: D. Appleton and company. 1916. In 1831, Jippensha became paralyzed. On his deathbed, Jippensha is said to have enjoined his pupils to place upon his corpse, before his cremation, certain packets which he solemnly entrusted to them. He died on August 7 of that year. At his funeral, prayers having been said, the pyre was lighted, whereupon it turned out that the packets were full of firecrackers, which exploded merrily. Jippensha had kept his youthful promise that his life would be full of surprises, even after his death. As above, this tale is most likely not true. His ashes were buried in Asakusa in Tokyo at the Zenryu temple.

Origin  The J√∫car, the great river of the Valencian community, is most characteristic of the Ribera Alta, bringing water from the Cuenca to fertilize this plain, situated to the south of the Valencia. The economy of this predominantly agricultural regionis based primarily upon the orange harvest, a crop which has been cultivated since the 18th century. From its rich historical and artistic heritage, the most noteworthy of all of the region‚Äôs treasures are the towns of La Pobla Llarga, Carcaixent and Alzira. These, alongside a rich and varied gastronomy and an extensive festival calendar, make this region, which is still virtually untouched by tourists, a very attractive area in which to spend time.

Here the specialties include the well-known food of the fens such as dry rice dishes and stews cooked on an open fire or in the heat of clay ovens. Dishes such as all ipebre (potatoes and eels), espardeny√† (potatoes, eels, rabbit and eggs), as well as the universally known Valencian paella, provide a diverse culinary offering which can be tasted in the many bars and restaurants of the region. The desserts consist of a rich and varied range of sweetbreads and cakes, the most noteworthy of which include arnad√≠ de carabassa, pastissets de moniato, panquemados from Alberic or fougasses, made of sugar and flour, not to mention honey from Montroy, all to be taken with the excellent Moscatel and Malvazia wines from Montserrat and Turis. The Ribera Alta is an excellent festive region, with annual fiestas taking place in each and every one of the villages and towns, most notably the popular religious festivities and celebrationsheld in the summer months. Some of the most outstanding fiestas are the Fallas of Saint Joseph, where statues are erected and then burnt in many villages in the middle of March, les Danses de Guadassuar, held in the last week of August, the festivals of Mare de d√©u delLluch in the village of Alzira and Mare de D√©u d‚ÄôAig√ºes Vives in the village of Carcaixent, or the festival of Mare de D√©u de la Salut in the village of Algemesi on September, and which has taken place for over 800 years. La Mare de D√©u de la Salut Festival takes place in the historical parts of the city of Algemes√≠ on 7 and 8 September each year. Here the music of the dol√ßaina i tabalet, a type of flute, accompanies the traditional dances of la carxofa, elsarquets, les pastoretes and the popular la Muixeranga. These festivals have been officially declared of tourist interest and precede the Semana de Bous (Week of the Bulls), which takes place in the interesting bullring, which unusually, is rectangular-shaped. Valencian espardenya at algemesi La Mare de D√©u de la Salut Festival Tabaleter with typical Valencian drums  Orange's birthplace  The Garden of the Hesperides by Frederick, Lord Leighton, 1892. The orange is the fruit of the citrus sinensis or aurantium, a tree that first appeared in China and other southern areas of the Asian continent. The fruit made its way from the Far East to the European continent, reaching Spain, through Valencia, and spreading throughout the rest of the world. In Greek mythology the Garden of the Hesperides is a mythological grove where apples grew tended to by nymphs and a dragon. Hercules, the hero of classical literature, killed the guardian, entered the garden and plucked those golden apples ‚ÄìIn later years it was thought that the \\"golden apples\\" might have actually been oranges, a fruit unknown to Europe before the Middle Ages. Several scholars defend that the etymology of the word comes from the Sanskrit term narang and the Persian word narensh. When Arabs brought orange farming to the Iberian Peninsula, they called the fruits naranjah. The Region of Valencia maintained the orange-farming tradition after the Arabic period, with references to orange trees in the city of Valencia dating back to the 14th century. In fact, there is an Orange Courtyard inside Valencia‚Äôs 15th century Silk Exchange market (La Llotja de la Seda), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The first references to commercial orange plantations date back to the 18th century. At present, there are approximately 150,000 hectares of orange groves in the Region of Valencia producing orange and mandarin varieties including satsumas, clementines, navel oranges, common oranges, blood oranges, and hybrids, as the most important specimens Ribera Alta has a long orange farming tradition. The economy and population boomed in the area in the 18th century, and Ribera Alta profited from an expansion that also affected a sector as important as agriculture. Orange farming was introduced in this context. According to the historical records, in 1781 priest Vicente Monz√≥, notary Maseres and pharmacist Bod√≠, planted the first fields of orange trees in Carcaixent. The trees thrived in the land, favoured by the benign Mediterranean climate, and adapted perfectly to Valencian soil both on rain-fed farmland and irrigated land fed by river J√∫car, whose extensive irrigation channel distributed fertile water around the whole of the Ribera Altaarea. In the early 19th century, orange trees gradually started to replace other crops, such as rice, cereal and mulberries, taking over as the main local crop. Wholesale exports of oranges commenced in this century, fuelled by the arrival of the railway.

The mount was an unusual design, having a platform with three outriggers instead of the usual four. Its main use was for positional air defence of important cities and installations. Background and design Around 1930 it became clear that a more modern anti-aircraft gun than the M/16, which had been designed in the latter half of World War I, was needed. A number of 76 mm anti-aircraft guns had been bought from Bofors in 1928, but were no more modern than the M/16. In 1932 a new and innovative anti-aircraft gun was designed. Partly based on the M/16, it was mounted on a low-slung trailer with three outriggers. Two of them folded together for transportation, and two rubber wheels could be mounted. The outriggers could be adjusted in elevation to a limited extent to help place the mount in a horizontal position. The mount allowed for a 360¬∞ traverse and an elevation between 0¬∞ and 85¬∞. The gun had a muzzle brake to reduce recoil, a hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder and a gas cylinder to aid the forward movement of the barrel at high elevations. In addition the mount had two heavy springs to counterbalance the barrel, as the entire barrel was mounted ahead of the pivots. It (the barrel), was 45 calibres long and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right - like the M/16's barrel. The breech block was also similar to the M/16: a semi- automatic horizontal-wedge that the gunner had to open manually to remove the case from the previous shot, but which closed automatically on insertion of a new round. Like late models of the M/16, the M/32 was equipped to receive gun- laying information from a central sight, and also had a device for automatically adjusting the timing of the fuses on the shells. Service history and fate The M/32, first issued to units of the Norwegian Army in 1936, was well liked. First used at the anti-aircraft school based at Stavern, guns were also issued to the units responsible for defending Oslo and Raufoss. It remained in Norwegian service until the Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940. At Raufoss, a total of four M/32s were installed in two batteries. After observing several aircraft out of the guns' range, one of the units was sent to Elverum to protect the Parliament and the King. These two guns were destroyed and abandoned when the battery retreated. The remaining two-gun unit at Raufoss fired at aircraft in the evening of 9 April, with no visible result. After several days, the battery was moved to Domb√•s, where one of the guns was damaged while being set up. At Domb√•s the last M/32 was used to engage German paratroopers on the ground, leading to the surrender of the German force, as well as firing at German bombers with unknown results. In Oslo, the M/32 was installed in four batteries of three guns each. These units were well equipped, by contemporary Norwegian standards, with central sights, range and height finders. When the Germans attacked Oslo, the batteries all took part in the defensive battle. In spite of a lack of ammunition, unreliable fuses, electrical batteries that discharged too quickly, central sights that fell apart due to the shock waves from firing, lack of training and more. The batteries claimed to have shot down five or six German aircraft. However, after reviewing the Luftwaffe's own reports and the number of wrecked aircraft in the Oslo area on 9 April, researchers have concluded that probably only one German aircraft was shot down by ground-based air defence. A number of aircraft were hit, some very seriously, but only one seems to have crashed as a result. The guns were abandoned when Oslo surrendered due to the threat of German bombing of civilians. The fate of the M/32s after the Germans captured Norway is unknown, but they probably used them for air defence in Norway. Today one is preserved at the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum in Oslo.

Plot summary The play is concerned with the significance of rock and roll in the emergence of the socialist movement in Eastern Bloc Czechoslovakia between the Prague Spring of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution of 1989. Taking place in Cambridge, England and in Prague, the play contrasts the attitudes of a young Czech PhD student and rock music fan, who becomes appalled by the repressive regime in his home country, with those of his British Marxist professor, who unrepentantly continues to believe in the Soviet ideal. The play takes place over several decades from the late 1960s until 1990, ending with a concert given by The Rolling Stones that year in Prague. Recurrent references are made to a glimpse by one of the main characters of the young Syd Barrett performing Golden Hair. Barrett's physical and mental decline also plays a role in the drama (Barrett in fact died during the play's run). The underground Czech group The Plastic People of the Universe are held up by another character as an ideal of resistance to Communism. The poetry of Sappho is another recurrent motif; its pagan sensualism is implicitly compared with the anarchic erotic force of Rock music. One of the characters, a Czech writer, is named Ferdinand as an homage to V√°clav Havel. Havel wrote three plays with a protagonist named Ferdinand Vanƒõk, a stand-in for Havel himself. These plays were distributed by samizdat and became a symbol of the resistance. A number of Havel's friends then wrote their own Vanƒõk plays with Ferdinand Vanƒõk as a character.Goetz-Stankiewicz, Mark√©ta. The Vanƒõk Plays, University of British Columbia Press, 1987. Stoppard continues in that tradition. This play is one of several works in Stoppard's oeuvre concerned with artistic dissent against the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia: Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth also concerns this, as does Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Professional Foul. Original production The original production was staged at the Royal Court Theatre and ran from 3 June until 15 July 2006. It then transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre.

The premiere of the play was attended by first president of the post-Communist Czech Republic and leading figure of the Velvet Revolution, V√°clav Havel (a friend of Stoppard's) and rock star Mick Jagger, whose band, The Rolling Stones, features in the final scene of the play. Jagger has worked with Stoppard previously, having produced the film Enigma, for which Stoppard wrote the screenplay, and has, along with his production company Jagged Films, \\"approached\\" Stoppard \\"for the movie rights\\" to the play Rock 'n' Roll.\\"Jagger Set to Team Up with Stoppard\\", contactmusic.com, accessed 28 April 2007.

Then after creating original works over several decades, he achieved a graphic art with an Iranian flavor, which indeed prompted museums and collectors across the world to add his works to their collections. His secondary activities included the establishment of graphic art sections for the Iranian radio and TV in 1968 and for Soroush Publisher in 1971. He was also one of the co-founders of the Iranian graphic designer society \\"IGDS\\", an artist advisor and jury member of the Iranian graphic art Biennal. He has also been teaching in eminent art faculties in Tehran since 1976. All along his schooling years and professional career, he has held exhibitions of his paintings, photographers and, particularly, graphic works in Iran and abroad, notably in England, France and United States.

Life and career Francis Barrallier was the eldest son of Jean-Louis Barrallier, a French marine engineer and Royalist supporter who escaped to the United Kingdom in 1793 during the Siege of Toulon by the Republicans. Francis arrived in Australia in April 1800 and in July 1800 the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King, appointed him as an ensign in the New South Wales Corps. He was made engineer and artillery officer in August 1801. His first assignment was to design the Parramatta orphan asylum building. In March 1801 he sailed with Lieutenant James Grant in to further explore Bass Strait, and was responsible for the charting of Western Port and other parts of the coast. Barrallier's work on the maps of Jervis Bay, Western Port and some of Bass Strait were recognised by Governor Philip Gidley King, who made him engineer and artillery officer in the Corps. In June a voyage with Grant was made to the Hunter River, where Barrallier made a survey of Coal Harbour (now Newcastle) and part of the river. In October‚ÄìNovember 1802 he was directed by Governor King to try to find a way over Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney. He travelled about 140 miles in seven weeks, but had to turn back ‚Äì at one stage due to unfriendly Aborigines, and later due to a lack of supplies. He did not succeed in crossing the range. His finishing point was \\"towards the head of Christy's Creek, about 15 or 16 miles in a direct line southerly from Jenolan Caves\\".Serle (1949) In the May 1803 he resigned from the New South Wales Corps and left for England. Other examples of his work in Sydney included the design of the fort on Observatory Hill (used as a signal station in the 1850s) and plans for the first vessel built in Sydney. In 1805 he was appointed a lieutenant in the 90th Regiment. In 1806 he was at St Vincent, and in 1809 was present at the capture of the island of Martinique. He was made a captain in 1812. He spent some years making a military survey of the island of Barbados, was present at the capture of Guadeloupe in 1814, and was appointed surveyor-general of the island. Barrallier returned to England in 1819. He died in London on 11 June 1853. Barrallier Island in Western Port and the locality of Barrallier, New South Wales are named after him.

Besides the influence that Aramaic and Egyptian would have on particular texts, i.e. the words we have written down in the extant Hebrew and Greek manuscripts being shaped into that form after first being contrived in the minds of writers whose mother tongues were Aramaic and Egyptian, we also have portions of texts written directly in those languages. There are numerous Egyptian loanwords in the Torah. For instance, in the account of Moses being placed in the river in an ark (basket) behind the bullrushes (Sh'mot/Exodus 2:3), the words for ark, river, and bullrushes are all transliterated into Hebrew from Egyptian. Yahuda counts at least eighteen Egyptian loanwords in the full account of Moses‚Äô infancy.A. S. Yahuda, The Accuracy of the Bible (London: William Heinemann, Ltd., 1934), p. xxi. Large sections of Daniel and Ezra, as well as portions of Jeremiah and Nehemiah are written directly in Aramaic, as well as a few phrases found in the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline epistles. Other languages that are very important for linguistic criticism include Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Latin. Moreover, Arabic, Hittite, Eblamite, Canaanite, and Phoenician may be helpful depending on the interests of the critic. Linguistic criticism is not the same as textual criticism, though it does fall under that discipline. Where textual criticism may examine phenomena that occur within a single language, like elision, and even the likelihood of scribal error in recording what is dictated to him; linguistic criticism specifically inspects how languages affect one another in the process of translating from one to another, and how a language changes over time, psycholinguistically and aurally. A scholar employing linguistic criticism would look at a passage such as Matthew 27: 46/Mark 15:34, which the Greek text renders as \\"My God, My God! Why have you deserted Me?\\" (CJB), and instead of blindly accepting the Greek rendering of the Aramaic words Jesus spoke on the execution stake, would look to the Aramaic language for the meaning of that passage and discover that the Greek mistranslated it and that the correct interpretation is, in fact, \\"My God, My God! For this moment I have been spared!\\" or \\"My God, My God! This is my destination!\\" It would be immediately obvious from a study of the Aramaic passage that the word in the text \\"shabaktani\\" does not mean forsaken or deserted (that word would be nashatani); it means spared or destined.Victor Alexander, Aramaic Bible, (1998), footnoteCharles Weber. ‚ÄúPeshitta: A New Look at an Old Book.‚Äù Rays from the Rose Cross Magazine, (March/April 1996) References Biblical criticism ","title":"Linguistic criticism"},{"id":"5729314","text":"Swampsong is the third studio album by the Finnish melodic death metal band Kalmah.

Dehn and his partner, James Bernard, won the Academy Award for Best Story for Seven Days to Noon. Biography and work Dehn was born in 1912 in Manchester, England. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, and attended Brasenose College, Oxford.Clifford Dyment, Roy Fuller and Montagu Slater (editors), New Poems 1952 (1952), p. 161. While at Oxford, he contributed film reviews to weekly undergraduate papers. He began his career in 1936 as a film reviewer for several London newspapers. During World War II he was stationed at Camp X in Ontario, Canada. This was one of several training facilities operated by the British Special Operations Executive to train spies and special forces teams. He was the Political Warfare officer from 1942 to 1944 and held the rank of Major. Dehn took part in missions in France and Norway. He narrated the 1951 film Waters of Time and later wrote plays, operettas and musicals for the stage. He wrote the lyrics for songs in two films, The Innocents (1961) and Moulin Rouge (1952). In 1949 or 1950, Dehn began a professional collaboration with composer James Bernard. Dehn asked Bernard to collaborate with him on the original screen story for the Boulting Brothers film Seven Days to Noon (1950). Through the 1960s, Dehn concentrated on screenwriting for espionage films, notably Goldfinger (1964), The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), and The Deadly Affair (1967). He later wrote the screenplays for the second, third, and fourth original Planet of the Apes movies and received the story-by credit on the fifth. He wrote the libretto for William Walton's opera The Bear and two by Lennox Berkeley; A Dinner Engagement and Castaway.

Illustration from the artist Abbot Thayer's 1909 book on camouflage of a Luna caterpillar Actias luna a) in position b) inverted. Countershading, or Thayer's law, is a method of camouflage in which an animal's coloration is darker on the upper side and lighter on the underside of the body. This pattern is found in many species of mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, and insects, both predators and prey, and has occurred since at least the Cretaceous period. When light falls from above on a uniformly coloured three-dimensional object such as a sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading from one to the other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer and, later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott. The precise function of various patterns of animal coloration that have been called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), with the suggestion that there may be multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from the side; background matching when viewed from above or below, implying separate colour schemes for the top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of other largely untested non- camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare. The reverse of countershading, with the belly pigmented darker than the back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, such as the Nile catfish and the Luna moth caterpillar, have upside- down countershading for camouflage.  Early research  Thayer's 1902 patent application. He failed to convince the US Navy. The English zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton, author of The Colours of Animals (1890) discovered the countershading of various insects, including the pupa or chrysalis of the purple emperor butterfly, Apatura iris,Poulton, 1888. the caterpillar larvae of the brimstone moth, Opisthograptis luteolata and of the peppered moth, Biston betularia.Poulton, 1887.Thayer, 1909. p 22. However he did not use the term countershading, nor did he suggest that the effect occurred widely. Thayer's \\"White fowl, lacking counter-shading, against a flat white cloth.\\" A 1917 photograph of a countershading study by Thayer, who became obsessed by the mistaken idea that all animals are countershaded.Forbes, 2009. pp. 76‚Äì79. The model on the left is conventionally camouflaged and visible, whereas another on the right is so carefully countershaded that it is effectively invisible.Behrens, 2009. The New Hampshire artist Abbott Handerson Thayer was one of the first to study and write about countershading. In his 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, he correctly described and illustrated countershading with photographs and paintings, but wrongly claimed that almost all animals are countershaded.Thayer, 1909. For this reason countershading is sometimes called Thayer's law. Thayer wrote: Thayer observed and painted a number of examples, including the Luna moth caterpillar Actias luna, both in its habitual upside-down feeding position, where its countershading makes it appear flat, and artificially inverted from that position, where sunlight and its inverted countershading combine to make it appear heavily shaded and therefore solid.Thayer, 1909. Plate XII. Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.Goldstein, 2009, pp. 233‚Äì235. Hugh Bamford Cott in his 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals described many instances of countershading, following Thayer in general approachCott, 1940. pp. 35‚Äì46. but criticising Thayer's excessive claim (\\"He says 'All patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever prey or are preyed upon are under certain normal circumstances obliterative.'\\") that effectively all animals are camouflaged with countershading. Cott called this \\"Thayer straining the theory to a fantastic extreme\\".Cott, 1940. pp. 172‚Äì173. Both Thayer and Cott included in their books photographs of a non-countershaded white cockerel against a white background, to make the point that in Thayer's words \\"a monochrome object can not be 'obliterated', no matter what its background\\"Thayer, 1909. Caption to Figure 7. or in Cott's words \\"Colour resemblance alone is not sufficient to afford concealment\\".Cott, 1940. Caption to Plate 7. Cott explained that  Application  = In animals = Ibexes are effectively flattened by countershading, making them nearly invisible against a desert background. There are three in the image. Countershading is observed in a wide range of animal groups, both terrestrial, such as deer, and marine, such as sharks.ONR, 2013. It is the basis of camouflage in both predators and prey.Cott, 1940. p. 40. It is used alongside other forms of camouflage including colour matching and disruptive coloration. Among predatory fish, the gray snapper, Lutianus griseus, is effectively flattened by its countershading, while it hunts an \\"almost invisible\\" prey, the hardhead fish, Atherina laticeps which swims over greyish sands.Cott, 1940. p37. Other countershaded marine animals include blue shark, herring, and dolphin; while fish such as the mackerel and sergeant fish are both countershaded and patterned with stripes or spots.Cott, 1940. p41 Countershading existed in marine reptiles in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly appears to have been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest. = A related mechanism: counter-illumination = Another form of animal camouflage uses bioluminescence to increase the average brightness of an animal to match the brightness of the background.Young and Roper, 1977. This is called counter-illumination. It is common in mid-water pelagic fish and invertebrates especially squid. It makes the counter-illuminated animal practically invisible to predators viewing it from below.Young and Roper, 1976. As such, counter-illumination camouflage can be seen as an extension beyond what countershading can achieve. Where countershading only paints out shadows, counter-illumination can add in actual lights, permitting effective camouflage in changing conditions, including where the background is bright enough to make an animal that is not counter- illuminated appear as a shadow.Jones, 2004. p. 1151. = Military = Countershading, like counter-illumination, has rarely been applied in practice for military camouflage, though not because military authorities were unaware of it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general. Cott was a protege of John Graham Kerr who had quarrelled with Norman Wilkinson in the First World War about dazzle camouflage for ships. Wilkinson remained influential in 1939 as an inspector of camouflage, so a political argument developed. Cott was invited to camouflage a 12-inch rail-mounted gun, alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally. Cott carefully combined disruptive contrast to break up the gun barrel's outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder. The guns were then photographed from the air from various angles, and in Peter Forbes's view \\"the results were remarkable.\\"Forbes, 2009. p. 150. Cott's gun is \\"invisible except to the most minute scrutiny by someone who knows exactly where to look and what to look for. The other gun is always highly visible.\\" The authorities hesitated, appearing to be embarrassed by the evidence that Cott was right, and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation. Cott was posted to the Middle East, and Kerr unsuccessfully intervened, pleading for guns to be painted Cott's way and Cott to be brought home.Forbes, 2009. pp. 142‚Äì146, 149‚Äì151, 156. The Australian zoologist William Dakin in his 1941 book The Art of Camouflage followed Thayer in describing countershading in some detail, and the book was reprinted as a military handbook in 1942. Dakin photographed model birds, much as Thayer and Cott had done, and argued that the shoulders and arms of battledress should be countershaded.Elias, 2011. Countershading was described in the US War Department's 1943 Principles of Camouflage, where after four paragraphs of theory and one on its use in nature, the advice given is that:Anon, 1943. Inventors have continued to advocate military usage of countershading, with for example a 2005 US patent for personal camouflage including countershading in the form of \\"statistical countercoloring\\" with varying sizes of rounded dark patches on a lighter ground.Tooley, 2005. Research by Ariel Tankus and Yehezkel Yeshurun investigating \\"camouflage breaking\\", the automated detection of objects such as tanks, showed that analysing images for convexity by looking for graded shadows can \\"break very strong camouflage, which might delude even human viewers.\\" More precisely, images are searched for places where the gradient of brightness crosses zero, such as the line where a shadow stops becoming darker and starts to become lighter again. The technique defeated camouflage using disruption of edges, but the authors observed that animals with Thayer countershading are using \\"counter-measures to convexity based detectors\\", which implied \\"predators who use convexity based detectors.\\"Tankus and Yeshurun, 2013. File:Countershaded Rail-mounted Gun Camouflaged by Hugh Cott 1940.jpgRail-mounted guns countershaded by Hugh Cott (top) and conventionally camouflaged (middle), August 1940. The British authorities agreed Cott's countershading worked, but refused to adopt it.

File:Focke-Wulf Fw 190D-9 outside USAF.jpgTrue (graduated from dark to light) countershaded Focke-Wulf Fw 190  Function  Countershading acts as a form of camouflage by 'painting out' the self-shadowing of the body or object. The result is a 'flat' appearance, instead of the 'solid' appearance (with visual convexity) of the body before countershading. Hannah Rowland, reviewing countershading 100 years after Abbott Thayer, observed that countershading, which she defines as \\"darker pigmentation on those surfaces exposed to the most lighting\\" is a common but poorly understood aspect of animal coloration.Rowland, 2009. She noted there had been \\"much debate\\" about how countershading works.Rowland, 2011. She considered the evidence for Thayer's theory that this acts as camouflage \\"by reducing ventral shadowing\\", and reviewed alternative explanations for countershading. Camouflage theories of countershading, Rowland wrote, include \\"self-shadow concealment which results in improved background matching when viewed from the side\\"; \\"self-shadow concealment that flattens the form when viewed from the side\\"; \\"background matching when viewed from above or below\\"; and \\"body outline obliteration when viewed from above\\". These are examined in turn below. =Flattening and background matching when viewed from the side= Cott, like Thayer, argued that countershading would make animals hard to see from the side, as they would \\"fade into a ghostly elusiveness\\".Cott, 1940. pp 36‚Äì37. Rowland notes that Cott is here reviewing Thayer's theory and \\"reinforcing the view that a gradation in shading would act to eliminate the effects of ventral shadowing.\\" Kiltie measured the effect of the countershading of the grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, showing that when the squirrel is horizontal the self-shadowing of the belly is partly concealed, but that when the squirrel is vertical (as when climbing a tree trunk) this effect did not occur.Kiltie, 1944. Thayer's original argument, restated by Cott, was that nature did the exact opposite with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three- dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.Hershberger, 1970. =Background matching from above or below= The mackerel, Scomber scombrus, like many pelagic fish, is dark above, pale below, camouflaging it against the ocean depths and the bright surface. A completely different function of animal (and military vehicle) coloration is to camouflage the top and bottom surfaces differently, to match their backgrounds below and above respectively. This was noted, for example, by Frank Evers Beddard in 1892: Top/bottom countershaded Grumman F6F Hellcat Early researchers including Alfred Russel Wallace,Wallace, 1889, p 193 Beddard,Beddard, 1895, p 115 CottCott, 1940. and CraikCraik, 1944. argued that in marine animals including pelagic fish such as marlin and mackerel, as well as dolphins, sharks, and penguins the upper and lower surfaces are sharply distinct in tone, with a dark upper surface and often a nearly white lower surface. They suggested that when seen from the top, the darker dorsal surface of the animal would offer camouflage against the darkness of the deep water below. When seen from below, the lighter ventral area would similarly provide the least possible contrast with the sunlit ocean surface above. There is some evidence for this in birds, where birds that catch fish at a medium depth, rather than at the surface or on the seabed, are more often coloured in this way, and the prey of these birds would see only the underside of the bird.Ruxton 2004. Rowland concluded that each possible role for coloration patterns lumped together as \\"countershading\\" needs to be evaluated separately, rather than just assuming it functions effectively. =Outline obliteration from above= Rowland (2009) identified an additional mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round body such as a cylinder illuminated and seen from above appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above. =Non-camouflage theories= Non-camouflage theories include protection from ultraviolet light; thermoregulation; and protection from abrasion. All three of these \\"plausible\\" theories remained largely untested in 2009, according to Rowland.  Evidence  The sea slug Glaucus atlanticus swims and is countershaded upside-down. Despite demonstrations and examples adduced by Cott and others, little experimental evidence for the effectiveness of countershading was gathered in the century since Thayer's discovery. Experiments in 2009 using artificial prey showed that countershaded objects do have survival benefitsRowland et al, 2009. and in 2012, a study by William Allen and colleagues showed that countershading in 114 species of ruminants closely matched predictions for \\"self-shadow concealment\\", the function predicted by Poulton, Thayer and Cott.Allen et al, 2012.  Mechanism  Evolutionary developmental biology has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics to show how evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, such as in the house mouse, it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.  Reverse countershading  The honey badger is reverse countershaded, a form of aposematism (warning coloration). If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening the belly and lightening the back, would maximise contrast by adding to the natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals such as the skunk and honey badger with strong defences‚Äîthe offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.Edmunds, 2008. The caterpillar of the Luna moth, as discovered by Thayer, is in Cott's phrase \\"countershaded in relation to [its] attitude\\", i.e. shaded with a light back grading to a dark belly, as is the Nile catfish, Synodontis batensoda for the same reason: these animals (and other caterpillars including Automeris io and the eyed hawkmoth, Smerinthus ocellatus) habitually live 'upside down' with the belly uppermost. Similarly in the sea slug Glaucus atlanticus, the reverse countershading is associated with inverted habits. These animals are thus employing countershading in the usual way for camouflage.Cott, 1940. p. 43. Examples in animals File:Tragelaphus scriptus (male).jpgBushbuck, Tragelaphus scriptus, appears almost perfectly even in tone, showing that its countershading has cancelled out its self-shading. The white spots and markings help to disrupt the 'solidity' of the animal further. File:Sylvia borin (√ñrebro County).jpgMany birds, such as this garden warbler, Sylvia borin, are countershaded. The lighter belly makes the bird appear almost evenly coloured when seen from the side. File:Carolina_anole.jpgThe Carolina anole lizard, Anolis caroliensis, is smoothly countershaded. File:Adelie Penguin2.jpgAdelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, are white below and dark above, presumably to enable them to blend with the sea surface when seen from below, and with deep water when seen from above. File:Smerinthus ocellatus caterpillar on apple tree.jpgThe caterpillar larva of the eyed hawkmoth, Smerinthus ocellatus, is reverse countershaded, making it appear flat when upside-down in feeding position. File:Eyed_hawkmoth_larvae_reverse_countershaded.jpgWhen the eyed hawkmoth caterpillar is turned upright, as here, its countershading adds to the shading caused by sunlight, rather than \\"painting it out\\", so its body appears strongly rounded in this position. File:Striped Skunk (Mephitis mephitis) DSC 0030.jpgStriped skunk, Mephitis mephitis, has conspicuous warning coloration with reversed countershading, alerting predators to its powerfully defensive stink. File:Axis axis (Nagarhole, 2010).jpgChital deer, Axis axis. The animals in the background are effectively countershaded with their bodies horizontal, but the upright stag in the foreground is made conspicuous by its light belly. The spotting is disruptive.

The periostracum of this species has minute hairs, giving the snail a velvety feel A yellowish tan periostracum is visible on the lower two thirds of this juvenile (8 cm) valve of the marine bivalve Spisula solidissima The dark periostracum is flaking off of this dried-out valve of the \\"ocean quahog\\", marine bivalve Arctica islandica, from Wales Fresher valves of Arctica islandica with periostracum intact. Note that the periostracum is partially worn off on the umbo, this is because the umbo is older than the rest of the shell and also projects more: it has been exposed to more abrasion during the life of the clam On this Conus leopardus, natural rubbing has eroded the periostracum in some parts of the shell. Distorsio ventricosa, an example of \\"hairy\\" gastropod. The periostracum is a thin organic coating or \\"skin\\" which is the outermost layer of the shell of many shelled animals, including molluscs and brachiopods. Among molluscs it is primarily seen in snails and clams, i.e. in gastropods and bivalves, but it is also found in cephalopods such as Allonautilus scrobiculatus. Periostracum is an integral part of the shell, and it forms as the shell forms, along with the other shell layers. Periostracum is visible as the outer layer of the shell of many molluscan species from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, and may be seen in land snails, river mussels and other kinds of freshwater bivalves, as well as in many kinds of marine shelled molluscs. The word \\"periostracum\\" means \\"around the shell\\", meaning that the periostracum is wrapped around what is usually the more calcareous part of the shell. Technically the calcareous part of the shell can (at least in theory) be referred to as the \\"ostracum\\", but that term is only very rarely used. In molluscs =Composition= This shell layer is composed of a type of protein known as conchiolin. Conchiolin is largely composed of quinone-tanned proteins, which are similar to those found in the epidermal cuticle.Brusca, R.C. and Brusca, G.J. 1990. Invertebrates. Sinauer Assoc., Inc, Sunderland, Massachusetts. p. 716. = Function = The formation of a shell requires certain biological machinery. The shell is deposited within a small compartment, the extrapallial space, which is sealed from the environment by the periostracum, a leathery outer layer around the rim of the shell, where growth occurs. This caps off the extrapallial space, which is bounded on its other surfaces by the existing shell and the mantle. The periostracum acts as a framework from which the outer layer of carbonate can be suspended, but also, in sealing the compartment, allows the accumulation of ions in concentrations sufficient for crystallization to occur. The accumulation of ions is driven by ion pumps packed within the calcifying epithelium. The organic matrix forms the scaffold that directs crystallization, and the deposition and rate of crystals is also controlled by hormones produced by the mollusc. The periostracum was probably essential in allowing early molluscs to obtain large size with a single valve. The periostracum is secreted from a groove in the mantle, termed the periostracal groove. When secreted, it consists of the soluble protein periostracin; this polymer becomes insoluble through a tanning process involving quinone. =Description= Periostracum is often yellowish or brownish in color. In some species it is black. The periostracum is very often a different color than the underlying layer of the shell. In the shells of species which have periostracum, this shell layer is quite often physically worn away or chemically eroded in the parts of the shell that are older, thus it may only still be visible in the more recently formed areas of the shell. Periostracum can in some cases be quite thin, smooth, glossy and transparent, such that it looks almost like a thin yellow varnish, or it can be thicker and more or less opaque. When it is thick it is often relatively rough in texture and dull. In some species the periostracum is tufted, or forms hair-like growths which in some cases can give the fresh shell a velvety feel. In some species the periostracum adheres very tightly to the underlying shell surface, in others the periostracum is less firmly attached. In certain marine species, such as for example certain species of cone snails, a heavy periostracum obscures the color patterns that exist on the calcareous layer of the shell. In many aquatic species, once a shell has been removed from the water and has had time to completely dry out, then the periostracum may become brittle and start to flake or peel off of the surface of the shell. It is not uncommon for shell collectors to deliberately remove a periostracum layer (using household bleach) if they feel that a shell is more attractive without it. However the periostracum is an important part of the shell, and is definitely of interest to malacologists. Details of the periostracum can sometimes be very helpful in identifying a species.  Hairs on gastropod shells  Haired shells occur in gastropods in several species of the Stylommatophoran families Polygyridae, Helicidae and Hygromiidae. These families are only distantly related, suggesting that this feature has evolved several times independently. Haired shells are almost exclusively observed in species living in moist microhabitats, like layers of fallen leaves, broad-leaved vegetation, damp meadows or wet scree. Such a correlation suggests an adaptive significance of the trait in such a habitat; it was thus speculated that the hydrophobic hairs facilitate the movement in wet environments by relieving surface tension. These hairs can reach varying densities (up to 20 per squaremilimetre) and lengths (up to three millimetres). In some cases hardly visible, they confer an almost furry impression to the shell in others. These semi-rigid structures are part of the periostracum, a thin protein layer (conchiolin) secreted by the snail to cover the calcareous shell. Building hairs requires the snail to have specialised glandular tissue and complex strategies to form them. Consequently, this trait can be assumed to be costly and should thus present a selective advantage to its bearers in order to be conserved. Experiments by Pfenninger et al. (2005) on genus Trochulus showed an increased adherence of haired shells to wet surfaces. Haired shells appeared to be the ancestral character state, a feature most probably lost three times independently. The possession of hairs facilitates the adherence of the snails to their herbaceous food plants during foraging when humidity levels are high. The absence of hairs in some Trochulus species could thus be explained as a loss of the potential adaptive function linked to habitat shifts.  In brachiopods  The periostracum of brachiopods is made of chitin. Relatively new cells on the edges of the brachiopod mantle secrete material that extends the periostracum, but are displaced on the upper side of the mantle by more recent cells, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves.

The Volkspark Jungfernheide (Jungfernheidepark) is located within the former Jungfernheide. With the creation of Greater Berlin in 1920, Charlottenburg was joined with the former districts of Heerstra√üe and Jungfernheide to become the seventh district of Berlin.  Name  Memorial to Karl Ludwig Friedrich von Hinckeldey in the Volkspark Jungfernheide The name of the area is a combination of the word Heide, meaning heath, and Jungfer, meaning \\"Young noblewoman\\" or \\"damsel\\" (cf. Junker), from the Benedictine convent that existed in Spandau from 1269 until the 16th century and owned the area. The street Nonnendamm also relates to the nuns of Spandau.  History  = Forest and hunting grounds = The forest and heathland located east of Spandau were used as a royal hunting ground until 1800. In 1823, the forest areas of Charlottenburg and Tegel were designated as an estate (Gutsbezirk). = Military use = Beginning in 1824, the Jungfernheide was used for military drills and shooting grounds. In 1828, the Reinickendorf artillery grounds were relocated here by Frederick William III of Prussia. Barracks were constructed between 1896 and 1901 for the airshipmen battalion Luftschiffer- Batallion Berlin-Jungfernheide.Detailed plans for the airship battalion in the archives of the Architecture Museum of the Technical University of Berlin = Transit connections = The railway station Berlin Jungfernheide station was opened in 1877. In this year, the western section of the Berlin Ringbahn was also completed, which was primarily built for military purposes. S-train service between Jungfernheide and the Berlin Sonnenallee station stopped from 1980 until 1997 due in part to the Berlin Wall. Since reopening, Jungfernheide has served as an important junction in the northwest of Berlin, offering transfers between the Ringbahn, the U7 (Berlin U-Bahn), regional trains, local and express buses to the nearby Tegel Airport. Tegel Airport was built after World War II in the heathland of the Jungfernheide. = Water supply = In 1896, the Jungfernheide waterworks were opened, providing drinking water from Lake Tegel.

From the 9000 m¬≤ large area, Mierendorffstra√üe runs in the direction of Charlottenburg Castle and Kaiserin-Augusta-Allee in the direction of Moabit. It was named in 1950 after the social democratic politician, social scientist and writer . The bourgeois residential area around the square is also popularly known as the Mierendorff-Kiez. The historical name of the place, Kalowswerder, however, is hardly still common. Location and connections The square consists of two parts and is situated on the artificial island between the Spree and the Charlottenburg Canal and Westhafen Canal: the rectangular northern jewelry square with fountain and the triangular southern square area, where a weekly market takes place on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It is the busy connection point of a bus line with the line of the Berlin U-Bahn, whose underground station of the same name is located below the green area and was opened in 1980. History The former Gustav-Adolf-Platz, c. 1917 When planning the surrounding residential area for ordinary people, the square was already taken into account in 1887. It was originally named after King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in connection with the Reformation quarter. It was not until 1912/1913 that the park was designed by the municipal horticultural director Erwin Barth. In contrast to the magnificent and representative parks of the late 19th century, Mierendorffplatz is rather functional but at the same time sophisticated. The northern part of the square was again divided into two parts. In the eastern part a playground, in the west a flower garden was created, whose axis cross in the middle is supplemented by a fountain. Inside the square, roses were mainly planted. The plant is surrounded by plane trees. After the Second World War, the square was initially used for allotments. In 1950/1951 it was converted into a green area, which was then named after Mierendorff. After the construction of the underground station, which was built in the 1970s in an open construction method, the square could be reconstructed in close accordance with Barth's plans. Fountains, benches, gates and lamps were reproduced true to the original. The Gustav Meyer Prize (named after the landscape designer Gustav Meyer) was awarded for the historical reconstruction in 2000. A commemorative plaque commemorates Barth.

It was originally transmitted on 20 October 1972. Synopsis Mainwaring is depressed: his men are falling short of his expectations, his leadership is unappreciated. He then dreams that he is Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. Plot The episode opens with the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard unit in Eastgate cinema. They are watching a film about Napoleon, in particular a scene where he says goodbye to Marie Walewska, his mistress.Dad's Army: The Complete Scripts A panning shot moves across the faces of the platoon while they are watching, Mainwaring looking superior, Wilson looking bored, Frazer muttering \\"rubbish\\", Pike sucking his thumb, Godfrey asleep, Walker with his arms around a blonde girl, and Jones looking dreamy. After the film ends \\"God Save the King\\" begins playing, but the platoon all stampede out apart from Mainwaring who gets knocked over in the rush but struggles up to stand to attention while the anthem plays to a now empty cinema. The platoon is next seen on the upper deck of a bus going back to Walmington-on-Sea. Mainwaring asks the platoon what they thought of the film. Sponge says they should have sat at the front as he couldn't see. Mainwaring says he was disappointed - he thought the film would have been about strategy and tactics but consisted of Greta Garbo being chased around a four poster bed. Walker replies that that is strategy and tactics. Wilson and Mainwaring are given their tickets by an attractive bus conductress who Mainwaring takes a fancy to. When Walker, Pike and Jones start larking about then singing the ribald song \\"Roll Me Over In The Clover\\" Mainwaring stops them and apologises to the bus conductress. She is grateful and says he is \\"very gallant\\". Warden Hodges arrives, and teases the platoon for going to the cinema and not being ready for Hitler. Whilst buying a ticket he asks the bus conductress for a \\"tickle at the terminus\\". Mainwaring is furious and intervenes again, and is thanked by the bus conductress. He then instructs the platoon that after their disgraceful behaviour in the cinema, they are to let him go off the bus first and in an orderly fashion. When the bus stops at Walmington, Hodges lets him get halfway down the bus then shouts \\"It's closing time in five minutes\\", thus causing Mainwaring to get knocked over again in the stampede as the platoon rush for the pub. Later, the platoon are on parade. Frazer gives a long rambling explanation of how he complained to the manager about the \\"sheer historical inaccuracies of the film\\", but eventually admits sheepishly that he got his money back. Mainwaring berates them for the two examples of bad behaviour. They apologise, but he responds by saying that \\"fine words butter no parsnips\\". This provokes a discussion in the ranks, about how you can't get butter, or parsnips (with Walker offering to obtain both), until he says that the platoon will have to stand to attention whilst Sergeant Wilson plays the National Anthem on the gramophone 6 times. They stand to attention, but Wilson plays the German National Anthem \\"Deutschland √úber Alles\\" by mistake, and is half asleep so Mainwaring has to shout at him to take it off. He and Wilson go to Mainwaring's office, where they find the vicar at his desk, who refuses to get out of the way for Mainwaring. Whilst Jones continues to play the National Anthem at an increasing speed, Mainwaring and the vicar have to stand, then race to sit on the chair, like musical chairs. The next scene is in Mainwaring's office after the parade. Walker arrives and gives Sgt Wilson two bottles of Black Market stout, and presents Mainwaring with some similarly sourced cheddar cheese. Mainwaring excuses this to Wilson by saying it is for his vegetarian wife. He rings her to spring this 'toasted cheese supper' surprise on her, but she gets the wrong idea on the phone and says she has a headache and is going to bed. Mainwaring is disappointed, but Wilson suggests they eat the cheese between them. Mainwaring is touched, then Jones arrives and, tempted by the cheese, offers some kidneys if he can join them. Cut to the end of the feast, when Jones tells a wonderful rambling story about a native girl he nearly married in the Sudan. Mainwaring leaves to go home, suggesting that the bus conductress they met earlier wouldn't have turned down a toasted cheese supper. The next scene is in Mainwaring's Anderson shelter in his garden. He is having a restless night after eating the (rather indigestible) meal with Wilson and Jones. He takes some bismuth (indigestion) tablets. The scene now shifts, and we see Mainwaring dreaming that he is Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. It features the rest of the cast in various roles, including Wilson as Wellington, flanked by Frazer as Gordon of the Highlanders and Hodges as a senior officer. Sponge is Marshal Ney, Walker is \\"Captain Gerald\\" in the cavalry, Jones is a French Corporal, Pike is a French drummer boy and Godfrey is a French artillery man. Many catch phrases and actions are used: \\"put those lights out\\", \\"you stupid drummer boy\\", Private Godfrey's upside down cakes, \\"Oi, Napoleon\\", and also some phrases from earlier in the episode, such as Sponge saying \\"we should have sat down the front, in the ninepennies\\" when Mainwaring complains that he can't see the battle. At the surrender, Wilson acts very superior, for instance asking Mainwaring for his full name and address, and refusing to let Mainwaring borrow his pen. Mainwaring says farewell to his troops, with great comic effect. Hodges then tells the troops that the Duke will buy them all a drink, and in the stampede they knock Mainwaring over into the mud. Mainwaring is next seen just before being exiled to Elba, standing next to the bus conductress, who is dressed as Marie Walewska. They exchange farewells, then Mainwaring wakes up, to find that he has overslept and he has a rude note from his wife complaining that he didn't come home last night.

The building is still in use as a school ‚Äì Hazelwood East Middle School. During the early 1960s, as farmland became subdivisions, more students enrolled in the district and a new high school was needed; the second Hazelwood High School was established in 1966 to deal with the rapid growth of the Hazelwood School District during that time. The first year it held 2515 students who were in the 10th to 12th grades. It was the only high school in the district and it quickly became overcrowded as the \\"baby boomers\\" reached high school age. By the mid 1970s, the Central designator appeared in the school's name, followed by East and West, indicating from which portion of the district students lived. The rapid growth of the district proved too much even for a building of Hazelwood's size, however, and in 1970, the school was forced to split the student body into two shifts, with one shift attending from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and one from 1:05 p.m. to 7:05 p.m. Later, overlapping shifts were used with a one-hour stating time change because they could not get 100% of the students in nor out of the building at one time. In 1977, with the opening of two more high schools Hazelwood East High School and Hazelwood West High School, Hazelwood Central returned to a conventional day schedule. =2000‚Äì2001 School Year= By the 2000‚Äì2001 school year, Hazelwood Central's population was once again growing, this time in response to increasing subdivision development within the school district, land that had for decades been open farmland or otherwise vacant. By 2005, the student body population was once again approaching 3,000 students and overcrowding was becoming a problem. =2006‚Äì2007 School Year= During the 2006‚Äì2007 school year, the district announced that it was redrawing the boundaries of the three high schools, effective fall 2008. The net effect of this change on Central is expected to be a reduction in enrollment from nearly 3,000 to approximately 2,500 while increasing the population at Hazelwood West High School.

It is the largest and principal organization in the Pacific Air Forces Fifth Air Force. The Wing's 18th Operations Group is a successor organization of the 18th Pursuit Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II. Mission The 18th Wing's mission is to defend U.S. and Japanese' mutual interests by providing a responsive staging and operational airbase with integrated, deployable, forward-based airpower. The focus of the unit's operations is directed to accomplishing this mission. Strategy used to employ this mission centers around a composite force of combat-ready fighter, air refueling, airborne warning and control and rescue aircraft as well as medical aircrews tasked with transporting patients by air. Units The 18th Wing is composed of five groups each with specific functions. The Operations Group controls all flying and airfield operations. The Maintenance Group performs Aircraft and Aircraft support equipment maintenance. The Mission Support Group has a wide range of responsibilities but a few of its functions are Security, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support. The Civil Engineer Group provides facilities management, while the Medical Group provides medical and dental care. * 18th Operations Group (Tail Code: ZZ) **18th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron (Medical Aircrews) **31st Rescue Squadron (Pararescue) **33d Rescue Squadron (HH-60G) ** 44th Fighter Squadron \\"Vampire Bats\\" (F-15C/D) ** 67th Fighter Squadron \\"Fighting Cocks\\" (F-15C/D) ** 623d Air Control Squadron \\"Lightsword\\" (JADGE) ** 909th Air Refueling Squadron \\"Young Tigers\\" (KC-135R) ** 961st Airborne Air Control Squadron \\"Ronin/Cowboy\\" (E-3B/C) * 18th Mission Support Group **18th Contracting Squadron **18th Communications Squadron **18th Force Support Squadron **18th Logistics Readiness Squadron **18th Security Forces Squadron * 18th Maintenance Group **18th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron **18th Component Maintenance Squadron **18th Equipment Maintenance Squadron **18th Munitions Squadron **718th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron * 18th Medical Group **18th Aerospace Medicine Squadron **18th Dental Squadron **18th Medical Operations Squadron **18th Medical Support Squadron * 18th Civil Engineer Group **18th Civil Engineer Squadron **718th Civil Engineer Squadron Team Kadena includes associate units from five other Air Force major commands, the Navy, and numerous other Department of Defense agencies and direct reporting units. In addition to the aircraft of the 18th Wing, associate units operate more than 20 permanently assigned, forward-based or deployed aircraft from the base on a daily basis. Heraldry The fighting cock emblem, approved in 1931, symbolizes the courage and aggressiveness of a combat organization. History : For additional history and lineage, see 18th Operations Group The 18th Fighter Wing was established on 10 August 1948, and activated four days later at Clark Air Force Base. On 20 January 1950, the wing was re- designated the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing. =Korean War= North American F-51D-30-NA Mustang, AF Ser. No. 44-74651, cira 1950. This aircraft was deployed to South Korea and is marked as the Wing Commander's. North American F-86F-25-NH Sabre, AF Ser. No. 52-5371, of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, 1953. Aircraft marked as Wing Commander's. South African Mustangs during the Korean War The 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing was reassigned to Korea in July 1950 and entered combat. Its organization was as follows: * 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (F-80C, F-51D, F-86F) * 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (F-80C, F-51D, F-86F) * 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (March 1951 ‚Äì March 1952) (F-51D) * 2 Squadron SAAF, South African Air Force (November 1950 ‚Äì March 1951, April 1951 ‚Äì June 1953) (F-51D, F-86F) At the outbreak of the Korean War, the 18th FBG's 12th FBS provided personnel to form the \\"Dallas\\" fighter squadron, which rushed into battle. In late July, the group headquarters with two of its squadrons (12th and 67th FBSs) deployed with F-80s from the Philippines to Taegu AB (K-37), South Korea. From 28 July to 3 August, the 18th Group operated directly under Fifth Air Force then passed to the control of the 6002nd Fighter (later, Tactical Support) Wing. Pilots exchanged their F-80s for F-51 Mustangs. Combat targets included tanks and armored vehicles, locomotives and trucks, artillery and antiaircraft guns, fuel and ammunition dumps, warehouses and factories, and troop concentrations. In August, advancing enemy forces and insufficient aircraft parking at Taegu forced the group to move to Japan, but it returned to South Korea the following month to support UN forces in a counteroffensive. Because the front advanced so rapidly, operations from Pusan East (K-9) Air Base soon became impractical, and the group moved in November to Pyongyang East Air Base (K-24), North Korea. The 2nd SAAF Squadron joined the 18th in mid-November. Maj Louis J. Sebille was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his action on 5 August 1950: although his plane was badly damaged by flak while attacking a concentration of enemy trucks, Maj Sebille continued his strafing passes until he crashed into an armored vehicle. The Chinese Communist (CCF intervention) caused the group to move twice in as many weeks, first to Suwon AB (K-13), South Korea, then to Chinhae (K-10). From there the 18th FBG continued to support ground forces and carry out armed reconnaissance and interdiction missions. From November 1950 through January 1951, it earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for destroying roughly 2,400 enemy vehicles and severely damaging almost 500 more. From early 1951 until January 1953, the group and its tactical squadrons, moving from base to base in South Korea, operated separately from the rest of the 18th FBW. The group earned its second Distinguished Unit Citation from 22 April to 8 July 1951, when it flew 6,500 combat sorties while operating from sod, dirt filled, and damaged runways to counter the enemy's 1951 spring offensive. When in January 1953 the group rejoined the wing at Osan-ni AB (K-55), its squadrons transitioned to F-86 Sabrejets without halting the fight against the enemy. It flew its first F-86 counter air mission on 26 February 1953. In the final days of the war, the 18th FBG attacked dispersed enemy aircraft at Sinuiju and Uiju Airfields. The group remained in Korea for some time after the armistice. The wing was reassigned to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa in November 1954. =Cold War= Since November 1954, the 18th Wing under various designations has been the main United States Air Force operational unit at Kadena Air Base. Over the past 50 years, the 18th has maintained assigned aircraft, crews, and supporting personnel in a high state of readiness for tactical air requirements of Fifth Air Force and the Pacific Air Forces. Known Cold War-Era operational squadrons were: * 12th Fighter-Bomber/Tactical Fighter (12th FBS was at Kadena AFB November 1954 ‚Äì September 1967) F-86F, F-100D/F, F-105D/F/G * 44th Fighter- Bomber/Tactical Fighter (November 1954 ‚Äì March 1971) F-86F, F-100D/F F-105D/F * 67th Fighter-Bomber/Tactical Fighter (67th FBS was at Kadena AFB November 1954) ‚Äì March 1971) F-86F, F-100D/F, F-105D/F 18th TFW North American F-100A-15-NA Super Sabre Serial, AF Ser. No. 53-1587, landing at Kadena Air Base. Republic F-105D-31-RE Thunderchief, AF Ser. No. 62-4375, 12th TFS/18th TFW on 18 May 1971. Noted in October 2003 at the Combat Air Museum, Topeka, KS and still there October 2006, this F-105 was the last of its kind in use with any US military service when retired from the Air National Guard in 1983. It was a static display for four years at McGhee Tyson ANG Base, Knoxville, Tennessee, prior to transfer to the Combat Air Museum in 1992. McDonnell F-4C-18-MC Phantom, AF Ser. No. 63-7474, 67th TFS/18th TFW (photo taken at Korat RTAFB, Thailand). This aircraft was later modified to the EF-4C Wild Weasel flak suppression aircraft. Douglas RB-66B-DL Destroyer (Modified to EB-66E), AF Ser, No. 54-0542, 19th TEWS/18th TFW on 23 August 1974. McDonnell Douglas F-15C-22-MC Eagle Serial, AF Ser. No. 78-0497, 67th TFS/18th TFW on 13 October 1984. Flying the North American F-86 Sabres, the wing supported tactical fighter operations in Okinawa, as well as in South Korea, Japan, Formosa (later Taiwan), and the Philippines with frequent deployments. In 1957, the wing upgraded to the North American F-100 Super Sabre and the designation was changed to the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing. In 1960, a tactical reconnaissance mission was added to the wing with the arrival of the McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo and the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Tail Code: ZZ) The McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II replaced the RF-101 in the reconnaissance role in 1967. Beginning in 1961, the 18th was sending its tactical squadrons frequently to South Vietnam and Thailand, initially with its RF-101 reconnaissance forces, and beginning in 1964 with its tactical fighter forces supporting USAF combat missions in the Vietnam War. In 1963, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief replaced the Super Sabres. Known Vietnam-era squadrons of the wing were: * 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Tail Code: ZA, ZZ) (September 1967 ‚Äì June 1972) (F-105D/F) * Det 1, 12th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code: ZB) (F-105F/G) (Deployed at Korat RTAFB, Thailand, September‚ÄìNovember 1970. Redesignated as 6010 Wild Weasel Squadron and reassigned to 388th TFW) * 44th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Tail Code: ZL, ZZ) (March 1971 ‚Äì December 1972) (F-4C) * 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Tail Code: ZG, ZZ) (March 1971 ‚Äì October 1973) (F-4C) The deployments to Southeast Asia continued until the end of United States involvement in the conflict. An electronic warfare capability was added to the wing in late 1968 with the reassignment of the 19th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron from Shaw AFB, South Carolina flying the Douglas EB-66E Destroyer (Tail Code: ZT). The B-66s remained until 1970, flying daily over the skies of Southeast Asia. During the 1968 Pueblo crisis, the 18th deployed between January and June to Osan Air Base, South Korea following the North Korean seizure of the vessel. Frequent deployments to South Korea have been performed ever since to maintain the air defense alert mission there. The McDonnell Douglas F-4C/D Phantom II replaced the F-105s in 1971, and a further upgrade to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle was made in 1979. On 6 November 1972, the 18th Wing dispatched the McDonnell Douglas F-4C/D Phantom II fighters of 44th Fighter Squadron and 67th Fighter Squadron to the Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in Taiwan until 31 May 1975, to assist Taiwan ‚Äôs air defense, defend against aerial threats from China. The following are the units that the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing once stationed at Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in TaiwanÔºö thumbMcDonnell F-4C-23-MC Phantoms of the 44th TFS/18th TFW deployed at Ching Chuan Kang Air Base Taichung, Taiwan, 2 October 1973. Serial 64-0750 in foreground. * 44th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code: ZL) (6 November 1972 ‚Äì 10 April 1975) (F-4C/D) * 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code: ZG) (6 November 1972 ‚Äì 31 May 1975) (EF-4C) In May 1971, the 556th RS was also transferred from Yokota to Kadena with Martin EB-57E Canberra aircraft (Tail Code: GT) to the wing. It inactivated in 1973. In 1972, the 1st Special Operations Squadron was assigned, bringing their specialized C-130E-I. (Combat Talon) The RF-4C reconnaissance mission ended in 1989 with the transfer of the RF-4Cs to the 460th TRG at Taegu AB in Korea. Post Vietnam-era squadrons have been: * 12th Tactical Fighter (June 1972 ‚Äì May 1978, February 1981 ‚Äì October 1991) F-4D (June 1972 ‚Äì July 1979), F-15C/D (July 1979 ‚Äì October 1991) (Tail Code: ZZ) * 44th Tactical Fighter (December 1972 ‚Äì May 1978, February 1981 ‚Äì October 1991) F-4C (October 1973 ‚Äì June 1975), F-4D (June 1975 ‚Äì July 1979), F-15C/D (July 1979 ‚Äì October 1991) (Tail Code: ZZ) * 67th Tactical Fighter (October 1973 ‚Äì May 1978, February 1981 ‚Äì October 1991) F-4C (October 1973 ‚Äì September 1980) (Tail Code: ZZ), F-15C/D (July 1979 ‚Äì October 1991) (Tail Code: ZZ) =Modern era= The designation of the wing changed on 1 October 1991, to the 18th Wing with the implementation of the Objective Wing concept. The original designation, as determined by the then Wing Commander, Brigadier General Joseph Hurd, was 18 Wing; meant to mirror the numbering convention of the Royal Air Force. This was quickly changed however when it was disapproved by PACAF but there are coins, etc. from this time period that depict the wing's designation as 18 Wing. With the objective wing, the mission of the 18th expanded to the Composite Air Wing concept of multiple different wing missions with different aircraft. The mission of the 18th was expanded to include aerial refueling with Boeing KC-135R/T Stratotanker tanker aircraft (909th ARS); and surveillance, warning, command and control Boeing E-3B/C Sentry (961st AACS), and communications. Added airlift mission in June 1992 with the Beech C-12 Huron, transporting mission critical personnel, high-priority cargo and distinguished visitors. In February 1993, the 18th Wing gained responsibility for coordinating rescue operations in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean with the addition of the 33d Rescue Squadron (33d RQS). In November 1999, the 18th Wing underwent another change as one of its three F-15 units, the 12th Fighter Squadron, was reassigned to the 3d Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. In 2003 the 374th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan was moved to Kadena and redesignated the 18th AES giving the 18th Wing an added mission of patient transport. 18 AES crews utilize the KC-135s of the 909th ARS as well as other opportune aircraft including the C-17 and C-130. Between 24‚Äì31 March 2006, during Foal Eagle 2006 exercises, aircraft from the 18th Wing teamed with the U.S. Navy's Strike Fighter Squadron 151 (VFA-151) from Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) to provide combat air patrols and coordinated bombing runs via the exercise's Combined Air Operations Center. The 18th Wing has earned many honors over the years, including 17 Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. =Lineage= * Established as 18th Fighter Wing on 10 August 1948 : Activated on 14 August 1948 : Redesignated: 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing on 20 January 1950 : Redesignated: 18th Tactical Fighter Wing on 1 July 1958 : Redesignated: 18th Wing on 1 October 1991 =Assignments= * Thirteenth Air Force, 14 August 1948 * Far East Air Forces, 1 December 1948 * Thirteenth Air Force, 16 May 1949 : Attached to: Fifth Air Force, 1 December 1950 ‚Äì 31 October 1954 : Attached to: Twentieth Air Force, 1 November 1954 : Attached to: 6332nd Air Base Wing, 1‚Äì9 November 1954 : Attached to: Twentieth Air Force, 10 November 1954 ‚Äì 31 January 1955 : Attached to: Air Task Group Fifth, Provisional, 1‚Äì15 February 1955 : Attached to: Twentieth Air Force, 16‚Äì28 February 1955 : Attached to: 313th Air Division, 1 March 1955 ‚Äì 31 January 1957 : Attached to: Fifth Air Force, 1 February-30 September 1957 : Attached to: 327th Air Division, 6 November 1972 ‚Äì 31 May 1975 * Fifth Air Force, 1 October 1957 * 313th Air Division, 10 November 1958 : Attached to: Fifth Air Force ADVON, 28 January-13 June 1968 * Fifth Air Force, 1 October 1991‚Äìpresent =Components= Groups * 5 Reconnaissance: attached 1 December 1948 ‚Äì 16 May 1949 * 18 Fighter (later, 18 Fighter-Bomber; 18 Tactical Fighter; 18 Operations): 14 August 1948 ‚Äì 1 October 1957 (detached 16 May-16 December 1949, 28 July-30 November 1950, 1‚Äì9 November 1954, and 3-c. 30 September 1955); 1 May 1978 ‚Äì 11 February 1981; 1 October 1991‚Äìpresent * 35 Fighter- Interceptor: attached 7‚Äì24 May 1951.

MacGillivray was born in Aberdeen, the son of ornithologist William MacGillivray. He took part in three of the Royal Navy's surveying voyages in the Pacific. In 1842 he sailed as naturalist on board HMS Fly, despatched to survey the Torres Strait, New Guinea, and the east coast of Australia, returning to England in 1846. In the same year he was appointed as naturalist on the voyages of HMS Rattlesnake (Captain Owen Stanley), collecting in Australian waters at Port Curtis, Rockingham Bay, Port Molle, Cape York, Gould Island, Lizard Island and Moreton Island in Queensland, Port Essington (Northern Territory) and visiting Sydney (New South Wales) on several occasions. The expedition was in Hobart, Tasmania, in June 1847 and also surveyed in Bass Strait, and on the southern coast of New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago. On this series of voyages his most notable achievement was to make records of the aboriginal languages of the peoples he encountered. His account of the voyages was published in London. In 1852 he deserted his sick wife and his children in London, and sailed for Australia. T.H. Huxley found his consumptive wife down to her last shilling, and raised ¬£50 to send her and the children back to Australia where her parents could look after her. She died two weeks from Sydney (Desmond 1994 p217). MacGillivray's journey on HMS Herald was also doomed to failure. The ship visited Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Dirk Hartog Island and Shark Bay, Western Australia. On this expedition he was accompanied by Scots naturalist William Grant Milne. MacGillivray left the voyage early in 1855, having been dismissed by the captain Henry Mangles Denham. He had become a hopeless drunkard, and when he died, alone in a squalid hotel room, the records noted 'mother and father unknown' (Desmond 1994). MacGillivray died in Sydney, New South Wales, on 6 June 1867. He is commemorated in the name of the Fiji petrel Pseudobulweria macgillivrayi. He also collected a specimen of venomous elapid snake on the northeastern coast of Australia. It was described by zoologist Albert G√ºnther in 1858 as Glyphodon tristis but it is now called Furina tristis.

The hijackers demanded the release of Saeed, Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, who were leaders of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, to Pakistan. The plane landed in Kandahar and Taliban militia surrounded the plane, pre-empting any Indian commando operation. After negotiations between the Indian government and the hijackers, the hostages were freed eight days after the hijacking occurred, although a passenger, Ripan Katyal, was stabbed to death by one of the hijackers. The three prisoners were released in exchange for the hostages. Media descriptions The Times has described Saeed as \\"no ordinary terrorist but a man who has connections that reach high into Pakistan's military and intelligence elite and into the innermost circles of Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organisation.\\" According to ABC, Saeed began working for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in 1993. By 1994, he was operating training camps in Afghanistan and had earned the title of bin Laden's \\"special son.\\"Sept. 11's Smoking Gun: The Many Faces of Saeed Sheikh In May 2002, The Washington Post' quoted an unnamed Pakistani source as saying that the ISI paid Saeed's legal fees during his 1994 trial in India on charges of kidnap.Pearl Trial Moving to New Site After Threats The Washington Post. In 2008, National Geographic Adventure broadcast a show called Locked up Abroad: \\"India: Hostage to Terror\\" in which Saeed is depicted. In 2018 a Bollywood film called Omerta was released in which Saeed role was played by Raj Kummar Rao. Possible connection with 9/11 hijackers On 6 October 2001, a senior-level US government official, told CNN that US investigators had discovered Saeed (Sheik Syed), using the alias \\"Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad\\" had sent about $100,000 from the United Arab Emirates to Mohamed Atta. Investigators said \\"Atta then distributed the funds to conspirators in Florida in the weeks before the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil that destroyed the World Trade Center, heavily damaged the Pentagon and left thousands dead. In addition, sources have said Atta sent thousands of dollars ‚Äì believed to be excess funds from the operation ‚Äì back to Syed in the United Arab Emirates in the days before September 11.\\" CNN later confirmed this. The 9/11 Commission's Final Report states that the source of the funds \\"remains unknown.\\" More than a month after the money transfer was discovered, the head of ISI, General Mahmud Ahmed resigned from his position. It was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating the possibility that Gen. Ahmed ordered Saeed to send the $100,000 to Atta. The Wall Street Journal was one of the only Western news organisations to follow up on the story, citing the Times of India: \\"US authorities sought General Mahmud Ahmed's removal after confirming that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohamed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the insistence of General Mahmud.\\"'Our Friends the Pakistanis' ‚Äì The Wall Street Journal Another Indian newspaper, the Daily Excelsior, quoting FBI sources, reported that the \\"FBI's examination of the hard disk of the cellphone company Saeed had subscribed to led to the discovery of the \\"link\\" between him and the deposed chief of the Pakistani ISI, Mahmud Ahmed. And as the FBI investigators delved deep, reports surfaced with regard to the transfer of $100,000 to Mohamed Atta, one of the ringleaders of the 11 September attacks, who flew the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 Boeing 767-223ER commercial airliner into the North Tower of World Trade Center. General Mahmud Ahmed, the FBI investigators found, fully knew about the transfer of money to Atta.\\"FBI, CIA benefit from RAW's inputs ‚Äì The Daily Excelsior US investigators later said that this was a confusion with Mustafa al-Hawsawi, also known as Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad, who is currently held in Guantanamo Bay. The Pittsburgh Tribune notes that there \\"are many in Musharraf's government who believe that Saeed Sheikh's power comes not from the ISI, but from his connections with our own CIA.\\"Did Pearl die because Pakistan deceived CIA? ‚Äì The Pittsburgh Tribune Sheikh rose to prominence with the 2002 killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who at the time was in Pakistan investigating connections between the ISI and Islamic militant groups. In Pakistan, Saeed was sentenced to death for killing Pearl, however his complicity in Pearl's execution and the reasons behind it are in dispute. Further adding to the confusion surrounding the issue is that Khalid Sheikh Muhammad personally claimed to have been Pearl's killer. Saeed was seemingly implicated by Benazir Bhutto just before her own death in a hypothetical murder of Osama Bin Laden (which must have occurred in late 2001 or 2002). Several commentators have noted that, as she had previously been speaking about one of the sons of bin Laden during the interview, in all likelihood, Bhutto simply misspoke and had intended to say, \\"Omar Sheikh, the man who murdered Daniel Pearl,\\" rather than \\"the man who murdered bin Laden\\" ‚Äì such an important revelation about bin Laden's fate would certainly not have been stated so casually. Additionally, in subsequent interviews, Bhutto spoke about bin Laden in the context of him being alive. Daniel Pearl kidnapping Saeed was arrested by Pakistani police on 12 February 2002, in Lahore, in connection with the Daniel Pearl kidnapping. Pearl had been kidnapped, had his throat slit, and then been beheaded. Sheikh told the Pakistani court, however, that he had surrendered to the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency a week earlier.Wright, Abi. Committee to Protect Journalists, May 2006. Saeed's lawyer Abdul Waheed Katpar claims Saeed was arrested on 5 February 2002 and not on 12 February, and that evidence against the four suspects was fabricated by Pakistani police while the suspects were held in secret for a week. He also claims confessions were obtained under duress of torture and solitary confinement. However, Saeed also told Pakistani officials in court in February 2002 that \\"as far as I know\\" Pearl had been killed.http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/22/kidnapped.reporter/?related In January 2011, a report prepared by The Center for Public Integrity and The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, concluded Omar Sheikh was the mastermind of the plot to kidnap Pearl, leading to his subsequent murder. The report also confirmed the role of three codefendants convicted with Sheikh in Pearl's case. Nonetheless, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a former CIA captive, who had been tortured in 2003 in the CIA's archipelago of black sites, had confessed to the murder, and the report concluded his confession was credible. The report noted that FBI forensic experts had confirmed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's confession through \\"vein matching\\", identifying the pattern of the veins in the killer's hands in the video. The lead author of the report was Pearl's friend and colleague, journalist Asra Nomani. Hoax calls In the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, tensions increased dramatically between India and Pakistan. On 28 November, a hoax caller pretending to be then Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee threatened Pakistan President Zardari with war, leading to the Pakistan military being put in high alert. Military aircraft with live ammunition were scrambled to patrol above Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The same caller tried to get in touch with the real Pranab Mukherjee and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, claiming he was President Zardari but was unable to get through to either.Jailed militant‚Äôs hoax calls drove India, Pakistan to brink of war Dawn, Pakistan. A year after the Mumbai attacks, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper revealed that the hoax caller had been Saeed. Using a mobile phone smuggled into his prison cell, Saeed made the calls using a British SIM card. After the source of the hoax calls became known, intelligence agents confiscated Saeed's illegal phones and SIM cards and he was placed in solitary confinement.  In Popular Culture  Omerta a biographical film on Saeed, directed by the Indian filmmaker Hansal Mehta was released in 2020 on Zee5 OTT.

This disorder is considered to be a SALL4-related disorder due to the SALL4 gene mutations leading to these abnormalities. It is diagnosed by clinical findings on a physical exam as well as genetic testing and imaging. After being diagnosed, there are other evaluations that one may go through in order to determine the extent of the disease. There are various treatments for the symptoms of this disorder.  Symptoms  X-ray of arm showing absent radius and radially deviated hand, caused by Thrombocytopenia and Absent Radius syndrome Duane-radial ray syndrome has two major features that appear in the majority of cases. These two features are Duane anomaly and radial ray malformations. Each feature appears in 65% and 91% of cases respectively. = Duane Anomaly = Also known as Duane syndrome, Duane anomaly is a congenital strabismus syndrome that is characterized by certain eye movements. This results from improper nerve development for eye movement. The following are characteristics of Duane anomaly: * Inability to fully abduct (away from the midline) the eye either unilaterally or bilaterally * Narrowing of the palpebral fissure * Retraction of the globe on adduction (toward the midline) * Absence of the abducens nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve VI) * Abnormal eye movement due to the lateral rectus muscle being innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) = Radial Ray Malformations = This is characterized by hand and arm abnormalities. The following are specific characteristics: * Malformed or absent (aplasia) thumb * A thumb that looks more like a finger * Partial or complete absence of a radius * Shortening and radial deviation of the forearms * Triphalangeal thumb * Duplication of the thumb (preaxial polydactyly) = Other Various Symptoms = People with the combination of Duane anomaly and radial ray malformations may have a variety of other signs and symptoms. These features include: * Unusually shaped ears * Hearing loss * Heart and kidney defects * A distinctive facial appearance * An inward- and downward-turning foot (a clubfoot) * Fused vertebrae.  Causes  = Genetics = Duane-radial ray syndrome is caused by mutations in the SALL4 gene which is a part of a group of genes called the SALL family. This gene plays an important role in embryonic development by providing instructions to make proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs. SALL proteins act as transcription factors in that they attach themselves to certain regions in DNA in order to help control certain gene activities. Due to the mutations in the SALL4 gene, proteins can not be made because one copy of the gene in each cell is stopped from performing its duty. These mutations are heterozygous and can be nonsense, short duplications, or deletions. At this time, there is no clear reason as to why a reduced amount of the SALL4 protein causes the symptoms of Duane-radial ray syndrome and similar conditions. Duane-radial ray syndrome is inherited through autosomal dominance meaning that a mutation in one copy of the SALL 4 gene is all it takes to cause this syndrome. Those with this condition can have affected parents, but it can also manifest for the first time with no family history which is called de novo. Since Duane-radial ray syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to offspring.  Mechanism  The mechanism for this disorder is somewhat unclear. What is known is that Duane-radial ray syndrome begins with mutations in the SALL4 gene. Due to these mutations, the proteins involved in embryonic development for making tissues and organs are not functioning properly. These proteins then cause improper development of bones (e.g. absence of the radius), abnormal eye movements, and other miscellaneous symptoms.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis for this syndrome is based on clinical findings on a physical exam and the presence of a heterozygous SALL4 pathogenic variant. During the physical exam, Duane-radial ray syndrome is clinically established by the following clinical findings: * Duane Anomaly ** Limitation of abduction of the eye ** Retraction of the globe ** Narrowing of the palpebral fissure during adduction * Radial Ray Malformations ** Malformed, absent, or extra thumb ** A thumb that looks more like a finger ** Duplication of the thumb (preaxial polydactyly) ** Deformity of the arm due to a lack of the radius * Any of the symptoms above that can observed ** Hearing loss ** Clubfoot ** Unusually shaped ears =Related conditions= The varied signs and symptoms of Duane-radial ray syndrome often overlap with features of other disorders. * For example, acro- renal-ocular syndrome is characterized by Duane anomaly and other eye abnormalities, radial ray malformations, and kidney defects. Both conditions can be caused by mutations in the same gene. Based on these similarities, researchers are investigating whether Duane-radial ray syndrome and acro- renal-ocular syndrome are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with many possible signs and symptoms. * The features of Duane-radial ray syndrome also overlap with those of a condition called Holt-Oram syndrome; however, these two disorders are caused by mutations in different genes. = Evaluations after Initial Diagnosis = Evaluations by certain specialists should be performed following the initial diagnosis of Duane-radial ray syndrome. These evaluations will be used to determine the extent of the disease as well as the needs of the individual. * Eyes - Complete eye exam by an optometrist or ophthalmologist especially focusing on the extraocular movements of the eye and the structural eye defects * Heart - evaluation by a cardiologist along with an echocardiogram and ECG * Kidneys - Laboratory tests to check kidney function and a renal ultrasound * Hearing * Endocrine - evaluation for growth hormone deficit if growth retardation present * Blood - CBC to check for thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis * Clinical genetics consultation = Testing = Since Duane-radial ray syndrome is a genetic disorder, a genetic test would be performed. One test that can be used is the SALL4 sequence analysis that is used to detect if SALL4 is present. If there is no pathogenic variant observed, a deletion/duplication analysis can be ordered following the SALL4 sequence analysis. As an alternative, another genetic test called a multi-gene panel can be ordered to detect SALL4 and any other genes of interest.

Every King of Saudi Arabia, upon his death, has been succeeded by the crown prince, with a new crown prince then being appointed according to agnatic seniority among the sons of Ibn Saud, though various members of the family have been bypassed for various reasons. A deputy crown prince (second in line for the throne) was first selected in 2014. The current ruler of Saudi Arabia is King Salman, who succeeded King Abdullah on his death on 23 January 2015. On the same day, Prince Muqrin became Crown Prince only to be replaced three months later by Muhammad bin Nayef at the order of Salman.Saudi Arabia's king announces new heirs to throne, BBC, 29 April 2015. On the morning of 21 June 2017, Muhammad bin Nayef was deposed as Crown Prince and Salman's son Mohammad bin Salman was appointed to the position. The current crown prince is a grandson of Ibn Saud, the second of his generation to be officially placed first in the line of succession. The Allegiance Council was created in 2006 to facilitate the royal transfer of power. History =Abdulaziz \\"Ibn Saud\\"= The House of Saud controlled vast parts of the Arabian peninsula for two and a half centuries. The dynasty collapsed twice in the 1800s due to discord over succession. In 1890s, the Al Sauds were completely supplanted by the Al Rashid. The kingdom began to fight to restore itself through Emir Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman, known to the world as \\"Ibn Saud\\", and his capture of Riyadh in 1902. After much tumult, Saudi Arabia became a kingdom in 1932. As Ibn Saud conquered Arabia, he formed alliances by polygamous marriages to members of its biggest tribes. This strengthened his power within the Al Sauds and expanded his legitimacy in Arabia, not to mention nearly a hundred children, sixty of whom were boys. He died in 1953. =The question of succession in Arabia: 1920‚Äì1953= When Ibn Saud first began the reconquest of his kingdom, he had a son named Turki, who was considered his likely heir, but he died during the great influenza epidemic of 1918‚Äì19, leaving a pregnant wife behind. It was unthinkable to have a baby as heir to a kingdom that was patently unstable, as the Emirate of Najd was in 1920. The Emir decided to leave the question open, leaving hope for one of his brothers or his second son Saud to eventually take over what would become a mighty kingdom. In the late 1920s and early 30s, Ibn Saud's brother Muhammad bin Abdul-Rahman began to argue with him as to who would be next in line, his son Khalid, or Saud. In 1933, the king made his choice, and Prince Saud was declared Crown Prince. Late in life, King ibn Saud declared that he wished that the Saudi succession would be via agnatic seniority and that Saud's heir presumptive would be his next, and more capable son, Faisal. Accordingly, when the old king died in 1953, Saud became king and Faisal was immediately declared Crown prince. =Saud vs. Faisal= For the eleven years of his reign, the question of who was to succeed King Saud was considered a \\"done deal\\". However, as the war between the King and Crown Prince grew more heated in the early 1960s, the King let it be known that he was considering changing the line of succession from agnatic seniority to agnatic primogeniture and naming his eldest son Crown Prince. This was unacceptable to the rest of the Royal Clan, and at Faisal's request, Prince Muhammed led a palace coup which ousted the King in late 1964.Alrasheed M. (2002) A History of Saudi Arabia Cambridge University Press; pp. 108‚Äì9. =The problem of Prince Muhammed= Despite problems that led to his nickname \\"The Father of the Two Evils\\", Prince Mohammed was an intelligent and dynamic personality, leaving the possibility of another royal feud. During one of the times Faisal had taken over the government, he had appointed his half brother Khalid as Deputy Prime Minister in 1962, bypassing Muhammed. Secret negotiations as to the conditions to which Muhammed would step aside would last well after the reign of Faisal had begun, and Muhammed was technically Crown Prince from 1964 to 1965, when Khalid was declared to have the position, in the process disinheriting two other princes, Nasser and Saad, who were deemed \\"unworthy\\". =Fahd and Abdullah= One of the reasons that Muhammed initially demured from standing down, was his distrust of the so-called Sudairi Seven, the sons of Ibn Saud's favorite wife. The eldest of the group, Prince Fahd, was Faisal's top choice. He was given the position of \\"second deputy Prime Minister\\" and at the same time, royal sources let it be known that Prince Abdullah, head of the National Guard, would be in line after him. Between the two, they would reign for thirty-three years. =Return of the Sudairis= As King Khalid's health began to rapidly decline, the problem of succession came back into the fore. Crown Prince Fahd wanted his next full brother, Defense Minister Prince Sultan, to become \\"heir to the heir\\", but there was a hitch: there were two brothers senior to Sultan, namely Princes Bandar and Musa'id. Prince Musa'id was in disgrace, his son having murdered King Faisal, but Bandar was a different matter. For much of his life, Bandar had stayed away from government, preferring private business. However, now he demanded his right to the succession, and Prince Sultan's Defense portfolio as well. He was asked to name his price for stepping aside and, seeing that his more powerful brothers were inimical to the idea of his accession, Bandar read the writing on the wall and accepted the offer of money. He is said to have named a high price, but the massive bribe, reputed to be in the tens of millions of USD (US$), was something the world's richest family could easily afford. Bandar accepted the money and yielded place to Prince Sultan. King Fahd reigned over the kingdom from 1982 to 2005. King Abdullah ascended the throne in 2005 on his 81st birthday, whereupon Prince Sultan was automatically promoted to the position of crown prince. Most other surviving sons of Ibn Saud were elderly and bypassed. Crown Prince Sultan convinced the King to appoint the next Sudairi, Nayef, to the Second deputy spot. In 2011-12, both Sultan and Nayef died within months of each other, and a fourth Sudairi brother, Salman, became crown prince on 18 June 2012. Allegiance Council With the advancing ages of the sons of Ibn Saud (all are in their 70s and 80s), King Abdullah created the Allegiance Council to address the shrinking number of candidates for the throne. It is composed of 28 persons: King Ibn Saud's sons, the eldest sons of the brothers who have died and the sons of King and Crown Prince. The Council was led by Prince Mishaal. =Power of the Council= The purpose of the Council is to ensure the smooth transition of power in the event of incapacitation or death of the King or Crown Prince. This, along with an earlier decree by King Fahd, opened the possibility of considering Abdul- Aziz's grandsons as viable candidates. Beyond age, the criteria for selection include: *Support within the House of Saud *Tenure in government *Tribal affiliations and origins of a candidate's mother *Religious persona *Acceptance by the Ulema *Support by the merchant community *Popularity among the general Saudi citizenry. The Council votes by secret ballot. =Influence of the Council= With the promotion of Crown Prince Sultan's three successors deemed automatic, and the King's writ on the subject of the appointment of the second deputy PM (the honorific \\"deputy crown prince\\" being much more recent than the position itself). The Council has proved to be little more than a \\"rubber stamp.\\" Election of Prince Muqrin After almost a year with the post of second deputy Prime Minister vacant. During this time, there were reports of an attempted coup. In response to this, Prince Muqrin, the youngest son of Ibn Saud, was formally designated second deputy by royal decree in 2013. This meant that he was informally second in line, bypassing several senior princes. In order to make his place in the line of succession permanent and preclude any challenges by any of the dispossessed royals, King Abdullah polled each member of the Allegiance Council individually before announcing Muqrin's new title. The Allegiance Council met on 27 March 2014, for an official vote, which was 75% yes and 25% no. Election of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef As King Abdullah lay dying, a plot to change the line of succession was underway. It was said that Chief of the Royal Court Khaled al- Tuwaijri was conspiring with others to oust Crown Prince Salman and replace him with either Prince Muqrin or the King's son Prince Mit'eb. Upon the death of King Abdullah on 23 January 2015, Salman ascended to the throne and Muqrin became crown prince. At the same time, Muhammad bin Nayef, the Interior Minister and a supporter of Salman's, was appointed deputy crown prince, an act that was ratified by the Allegiance Council after the fact. Muhammad bin Nayef is the first grandson of Ibn Saud to enter the official line of succession. Removal of Crown Prince Muqrin Normally, the position of Crown Prince was an extremely powerful one, with Faisal, Fahd and Abdullah running the country on behalf of, or sometimes despite, their monarch. This was not the case of Crown Prince Muqurin, who was frozen out of King Salman's new double cabinet scheme and relegated to mostly ceremonial activities. Instead, King Salman's son Mohammad had been showered with offices, including the Defense Ministry, the Secretaryship General of the Royal Court and Chairmanship of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs, leading some in the press to dub him the \\"king in training.\\" Muhammad bin Nayef, the Deputy Crown Prince as well as the Interior Minister, was also a Sudairi, and it was clear that without Muqrin, the clan would have a permanent grip on power. In the early morning hours of 29 April 2015, the king signed a decree deposing Crown Prince Muqrin, promoting Muhammad to crown prince and naming Mohammad bin Salman deputy crown prince. The following day, The Allegiance Council met and formally elected Mohammed by a vote of 28 to four with two abstentions.New Deputy Crown Prince got 28 out of 35 at the Saudi Allegiance Council Al Arabiya, 30 April 2015, Retrieved 8 February 2020 Removal of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef On the morning of 21 June 2017, state television announced that Muhammad bin Nayef had been removed as Crown Prince, and that Salman had elevated his son Mohammad bin Salman to the position. According to the New York Times and other sources, MbN, as he is known to distinguish himself from his successor, who is known as MbS, was forced to abdicate and has since been under house arrest.

Early life Born in Glasgow, he attended the academically rigorous Glasgow High School, and then went on to study law at the University of Glasgow. During the years 1945 - 1948, he performed his national service flying with the RAF, after which he began his administrative career as a Chartered Accountant's apprentice with Alfred Tongue & Co. In 1951 he progressed to become a qualified assistant with Cooper Bros & Co. Cameron's first step into working within a university came in 1952, when he was appointed an assistant accountant of the University of Edinburgh remaining there for 13 years. In 1965 he took up the position of Secretary at the, then new, Heriot-Watt University. University Secretary of Heriot-Watt Heriot Watt University gained its Royal Charter in 1967 and became one of the UK's new technological universities. Cameron served as the University's Secretary for 25 years until his retirement in 1992. During this time he worked with five principals, two acting principals, four chairmen of court and two chancellors. Cameron's legacies at the University include: * In 1967, initiating one of the first Chairs in accountancy and finance, an innovative approach for training graduate-level accountants. * Between 1969 and 1992, he played a key role in the transfer of Heriot-Watt's campus from its city location to a new campus at Riccarton, an ambitious and successful plan involving negotiations with the University Grants Committee. * developing strategies for the transfer of technology and techniques into industry, resulting in entities such as Unilink, the pioneering industrial liaison unit, dedicated technology transfer units including the Institute of Offshore Engineering, Computer Applications Services, the Medical Laser Unit, the Marine Science Unit and the opening of the first UK university research park in 1971. * Heriot-Watt's reputation as 'Norway's University in Scotland' was largely due to Cameron's work in establishing links with Norway. He was later recognised for his achievements by the King of Norway. * From 1967 to 1990, he represented Heriot-Watt's interests on the Universities Central Council on Admissions. Achievements outside work Cameron contributed much to society outside of his work with Heriot-Watt. His work to strengthen Scotland's historical links with Norway were honoured with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, awarded by the King Olav V in 1979. He was also an active member of the Norwegian Scottish Association. He served as Justice of the Peace for several decades and was a highly respected session clerk of St Ninian's Church in Corstorphine, Edinburgh. From 1983-1988 he served as chairman of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and from 1989, became an honorary fellow.

The wing is part of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)'s Fifth Air Force. The wing was first activated in August 1948 at Johnson Air Base, Japan when PACAF implemented the wing base organization. It participated in the Korean War and later served in the air defense of Japan until inactivating in 1957. In 1966, the wing was again activated and served in combat in the Vietnam War until inactivating in 1972 with the withdrawal of US forces from Southeast Asia. It was soon reactivated at George Air Force Base, California, where it served until inactivating in 1992. It was activated the following year in Iceland as an air defense unit. With the drawdown of US forces in Iceland, it was inactivated the following year, but was activated the same year at Misawa. Mission The mission of the 35th Wing is to project power throughout the Pacific theater and execute worldwide deployments. Units The 35th Fighter Wing is a combat-ready F-16 wing composed of 4 groups, 2 fighter squadrons, 27 support squadrons and agencies, and more than 3,850 personnel. Host unit for 13,500-manned base supporting 35 associate units representing all four US military services and the Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF). The Operations Group controls all flying and airfield operations. The Maintenance Group performs Aircraft and Aircraft support equipment maintenance. The Mission Support Group has a wide range of responsibilities but a few of its functions are Security, Civil Engineering, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support. The Maintenance Group provides aircraft and mission support equipment maintenance, while the Medical Group provides medical and dental care. * 35th Operations Group (Tail Code: WW) : 35th Operations Support Squadron : 13th Fighter Squadron (F-16CJ/DJ, Red tail stripe) : 14th Fighter Squadron (F-16CJ/DJ, Yellow tail stripe) : 610th Air Control Flight * 35th Maintenance Group : 35th Aircraft Maintenance Operations Squadron : 35th Maintenance Squadron * 35th Mission Support Group : 35th Civil Engineer Squadron : 35th Contracting Squadron : 35th Communications Squadron : 35th Logistics Readiness Squadron : 35th Force Support Squadron : 35th Security Forces Squadron * 35th Medical Group : 35th Medical Support Squadron : 35th Aerospace Medicine Squadron : 35th Dental Squadron : 35th Medical Operations Squadron : 35th Surgical Operations Squadron History : For additional history and lineage, see 35th Operations Group The 35th Fighter Wing flew air defense missions in Japan, August 1948 ‚Äì November 1950. Redesignated 35th Fighter-Interceptor Wing in January 1950 and two squadrons (39th, 40th Fighter Squadrons) were equipped with Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star jet fighters. =Korean War= In July 1950, the 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group commenced combat from Ashiya Air Base in southwestern Japan. It quickly converted from F-80Cs back to the rugged and longer-range North American F-51D Mustangs it had given up only a short time before. Group headquarters and the 40th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron moved to Pohang Air Base (K-3) on South Korea's south eastern coast in mid-July, and the 39th Squadron followed on 10 August. The precarious ground situation in Korea forced the 35th Group to return to Tsuiki Air Base, Japan on 13 August, where it remained until early October. The two squadrons of the 35th Fighter- Interceptor Group were attached to the wartime 6131st Tactical Support Wing from 1 August, then to the 6150th Tactical Support Wing. The Korean War squadrons of the 35th FIG were the 39th (F-80C, F-51D), 40th (F-80C, F-51D) and 339th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons (F-82G, F-89). From 6 September, the group supported United Nations ground forces moving north of the 38th parallel. The squadrons focused their attacks on fuel dumps, motorized transport, and enemy troop concentrations until it moved in mid-November to a forward airstrip at Yonpo Airfield, near the North Korean port city of Hungnam to provide close air support to the U. S. Army X Corps. When Communist Chinese Forces (CCF) surrounded the 1st U.S. Marine Division at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, the F-51 Mustang-equipped squadrons provided close air support to the Marines. Relocating to Pusan East Air Base in early December 1950, the 35th Group continued supporting UN ground forces, eventually staging out of Suwon Air Base in March 1951 and Seoul Air Base in April. The combat-weakened group was transferred without personnel and equipment back to Johnson Air Base Japan in May 1951 where it was remanned and equipped with F-51s and F-80s and merged back with the wing to provide air defense for Japan. For its combat operations in Korea, the 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group was awarded the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation, and the UN Defensive, UN Offensive, CCF Intervention, 1st UN Counteroffensive and CCF Spring Offensive campaign streamers. =Air Defense of Japan= After the 35th's squadrons transferred back to Johnson in 1951, the group was reunited with the wing and flew several aircraft types. The wing also added aerial reconnaissance to its air defense mission. Aircraft flown included the RC-45, RF-51, North American F-86F Sabre and Lockheed F-94 Starfire. The group was returned to operational status on 15 July 1954, and from 14 August to 30 September 1954 was detached from the wing, moving to Yokota Air Base. All components of the wing were reassembled at Yokota in October 1954 and they served together until the wing was inactivated on 1 October 1957 with itse operational squadrons coming under the control of the 41st Air Division. =Vietnam War= 64th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron F-102 at Da Nang ABAircraft is Convair F-102A-75-CO Delta Dagger serial 56-1333 in 1966 On 14 March 1966, the wing was redesignated the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. Two weeks later, it was organized at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam, to replace the 6252nd Tactical Fighter Wing. While at Da Nang Air Base, the wing had five flying squadrons assigned or attached to it. Its aircraft were McDonnell F-4C Pantom II, Martin B-57 Canberra, and the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger Royal Australian Air Force MK-20 Canberra Bomber after return from Phan Rang Air Base, South Vietnam, 1971 A-37B of the 8th Special Operations Squadron, 1970 North American F-100F-20-NA Super Sabre Serial 58-1213 of the 352d Fighter Squadron at Phan Rang, 1971 In October 1966, the wing moved to Phan Rang Air Base, Republic of Vietnam, to replace the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. With the transfer, the 35th became the parent wing at Phan Rang Air Base. The attached No. 2 Squadron RAAF provided day and night bombing, photo strike assessment, and close air support primarily for 1st Australian Task Force in Phuoc Tuy Province. Missions included air support of ground forces, interdiction, visual and armed reconnaissance, strike assessment photography, escort, close and direct air support, and rapid reaction alert. It struck enemy bases and supply caches in Parrot's Beak just inside the Cambodian border, April‚ÄìMay 1970 and provided close air support and interdiction in support of South Vietnamese operations in Laos and Cambodia, January‚ÄìJune 1971. The wing's resources passed to the 315th Tactical Airlift Wing on 31 July 1971 when the 35th Wing inactivated. It was later reactivated at George Air Force Base California on 1 October 1971. For its wartime combat duty in Southeast Asia, the 35th Wing was awarded the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Crosses with Palm and the Vietnam Air; Vietnam Air Offensive; Vietnam Air Offensive, Phase II; Vietnam Air Offensive, Phase III; Vietnam Air/Ground; Vietnam Air Offensive, Phase IV; TET 69/Counteroffensive; Vietnam Summer-Fall, 1969; Vietnam Winter-Spring, 1970; Sanctuary Counteroffensive; Southwest Monsoon; Commando Hunt V; Commando Hunt VI. campaign streamers. =George Air Force Base= The 35th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned and reactivated at George Air Force Base, California on 1 October 1971, where it replaced the 479th Tactical Fighter Wing. The wing's mission at George was to train F-4 flight crews. Its aircraft initially carried GA as its tail code, but this was changed to WW. General-purpose F-4C/D/E/G training squadrons were: * 20th Tactical Fighter Squadron (December 1972 ‚Äì 1981) (F-4F) (1981 ‚Äì June 1992) (F-4E) From 1972‚Äì1975, the 20th flew German Air Force F-4F aircraft for training of German Air Force (Luftwaffe) pilots. USAF F-4E aircraft in German AF motif were flown after 1981. * 21st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (December 1972 ‚Äì October 1980) (F-4C) (later 21st Tactical Fighter Squadron (October 1980 ‚Äì October 1989) (F-4E), 21st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (October 1974‚Äì June 1991) (F-4E) * 431st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (December 1972 ‚Äì October 1978) (F-4D, 1972‚Äì1976) (F-4E, 1976‚Äì1978) * 434th Tactical Fighter Squadron (October 1971 ‚Äì October 1975) (F-4D) 434th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (October 1975 ‚Äì January 1977) (F-4E) * 4435th Tactical Fighter Replacement Squadron (October 1971 ‚Äì December 1976) (F-4C, Red/White Tail stripe F-4C 1972‚Äì1976, F-4E 1976‚Äì1977) * 4452d Combat Crew Training Squadron (October 1971 ‚Äì October 1973) (F-4D, 1972, F-4E, 1972‚Äì1973) * 4535th Combat Crew Training Squadron (October 1971 ‚Äì December 1972) (F-4C) Wild Weasel Training In addition to the F-4 training, in November 1974 Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs from the 17th Wild Weasel Squadron at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand were withdrawn from Southeast Asia and transferred to the 562d Tactical Fighter Squadron. By 1975, with the arrival of new F-4G aircraft, the wing was training aircrews exclusively in Wild Weasel radar detection and suppression operations for deployment to operational units in Okinawa and Germany. * 561st Tactical Fighter Squadron (July 1973 ‚Äì July 1980) (F-105F/G), (F-4G, July 1980 ‚Äì June 1992)***, The Yellow TailsUnder 37th Tactical Fighter Wing 1981‚Äì1989 * 562d Tactical Fighter Squadron (October 1974 ‚Äì July 1980) (F-105F/G), (F-4G, July 1980 ‚Äì June 1992), The Blue Tails * 563d Tactical Fighter Squadron (July 1975 ‚Äì July 1977) (F-105F/G), (F-4G, July 1977 ‚Äì October 1989), The White Tails * 39th Tactical Fighter Squadron (January 1977 ‚Äì May 1984) (F-4C/G Tail Code: WW) (January 1976 ‚Äì October 1980, not operational 1980‚Äì1982) (F-4E, January 1982 ‚Äì May 1984, The Green Tails F-4D Phantom of the 4452nd Combat Crew Training SquadronAircraft is McDonnell F-4D-28-MC Phantom serial 65-672 on 10 June 1972. Retired to AMARC as FP0308 20 September 1989. A trio of 561st Republic F-105G ThunderchiefsThe aircraft are serials 62-4427, 63-8285, and 63-8319, each carrying a practice bomb dispenser returning from a training mission in 1975. 63-8285 is now on static display at Davis‚ÄìMonthan AFB, Arizona. In 1980, the wing received the new F-4G and its advanced Wild Weasel system. By July 1980, the last F-105G left George Air Force Base, leaving the 35th with F-4Gs in its inventory for Wild Weasel training. Mission Realignments In mid-1978, the 431st TFTS was inactivated and replaced by the 561st TFS. Its F-4Es sent to the Air National Guard. The 39th TFS received the Air Force's first F-4Gs, and the F-4Cs were sent to the ANG. All 39th TFS aircraft and personnel were absorbed by the 562d TFTS on 9 October 1980 and the squadron was inactivated. Operations at George Air Force Base were reorganized by mission requirements 30 March 1981. The 35th Tactical Fighter Wing retained control of the 20th and 21st Tactical Fighter Squadrons and gained the inactive 39th TFS for combat ready operations. The 39th remained non- operational until January 1982 when it began equipping with Pave Spike- equipped F-4Es obtained from the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska and reorganized as a combat-ready tactical fighter squadron. In May 1984, the 39th TFS was inactivated. In July 1983, the 21st TFS was returned to a fighter training mission and renamed 21st TFTS. With the inactivation of the 39th TFS in 1984, the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing was redesignated the 35th Tactical Training Wing. However, the wing kept its air defense augmentation responsibility. It provided operations and maintenance support for the close air support portion of Army training exercises conducted at the U.S. Army National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, from 1981 to 1990. Also, the wing advised specific Air National Guard units on F-4 operations from 1981 to 1991. The new 37th Tactical Fighter Wing assumed the 561st and 562nd Tactical Fighter Squadrons active Wild Weasel missions in March 1981. This training ended in October 1989 when the 37th Wing moved to Tonopah Test Range Nevada assuming Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk operational development. All Wild Weasel operations (561st, 562d TFS) were consolidated under the newly redesignated 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. =Desert Shield/Desert Storm= In August 1990, the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing mobilized in support of Operation Desert Shield. On 16 August 1990, 24 F-4Gs of the 561st Tactical Fighter Squadron left George Air Force Base en route to Shaikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain. Once in the Middle East, its deployed people established operational, maintenance and living facilities for the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional). These facilities eventually housed more than 60 active duty and Air National Guard F-4s and more than 2,600 military members. During Operation Desert Storm, the 561st Tactical Fighter Squadron flew 1,182 combat sorties for a total of 4,393.5 hours. The 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional) was credited with flying 3,072 combat missions for 10,318.5 hours. U.S. Central Command relied heavily on the wing's Wild Weasels to suppress enemy air defense systems. The F-4G aircrews were credited with firing 905 missiles at Iraqi targets, while the RF-4C aircrews shot more than 300,000 feet of vital reconnaissance film. During operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional) suffered no casualties. The wing's people began returning to George Air Force Base 23 March 1991, with its aircraft and pilots following three days later. The 35th became the host unit for George Air Force Base when the 831st Air Division there inactivated 31 March 1991. As a result, the wing gained several support agencies, including the 35th Combat Support Group and associated squadrons. In support of the Air Force's force reduction programs, the 21st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron inactivated 28 June 1991. In October 1991, as part of the Air Force's reorganization plan, the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing was redesignated the 35th Fighter Wing. A month later, the wing's tactical fighter squadrons were redesignated fighter squadrons. On 1 June 1992, the 35th was transferred to the new Air Combat Command. In 1988, George was scheduled in the first round of base closures passed by Congress under the Base Realignment and Closure program. In 1991, the 35th began downsizing in preparation for the closure of George Air Force Base. * The 21st TFTS was inactivated on 28 June 1991 and its F-4 aircraft sent to AMARC. It was later reactivated as a Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II squadron at Shaw Air Force Base in November. * On 5 June 1992, the 20th Fighter Squadron was reassigned to the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, where it continued its mission of conducting training for the German Air Force. * The Wild Weasel training program was shut down and the 561st and 562d Fighter Squadrons were inactivated on 1 June 1992. The F-4Gs were sent to Nellis AFB, Nevada and between February 1993 and October 1996, the 561st was briefly reactivated as part of the 57th Operations Group as the USAF's last F-4G squadron. It was again inactivated and its F-4G aircraft sent to AMARC. Shortly thereafter, on 15 December, the 35th Fighter Wing inactivated and George Air Force Base was closed pursuant to BRAC, bringing an end to 21 years of continuous service and more than 34 years of total service for the 35th. =Iceland= McDonnell Douglas F-15C-28-MC Eagle serial 80-0035 of the 57th FIS Less than six months after its inactivation, the 35th was again called to service. On 31 May 1993, the 35th Fighter Wing was redesignated the 35th Wing and activated at Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland. The 35th replaced Air Forces Iceland, which had served as a wing equivalent command at NAS Keflavik for more than 40 years. Its new mission was to deter aggression, stabilize the North Atlantic region and protect the sovereign airspace of Iceland through the use of combat capable surveillance, air superiority and rescue forces. The wing's 57th Fighter Squadron protected the northern airspace with its McDonnell Douglas F-15C/D fighters. Its surveillance mission was handled by the 932d Air Control Squadron through the Iceland Regional Operations Control Center and four remote radar sites located on the four corners of the island. The 56th Rescue Squadron's four Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters flew combat rescue and reaction force insertion missions. The 35th Wing was inactivated at Keflavik on 30 September 1994, being replaced by the 85th Wing, with the station being reassigned from Air Combat Command to United States Air Forces in Europe. The 57th Squadron was inactivated concurrent with the wing, with the Icelandic fighter alert mission assumed by rotational elements from CONUS-based Air National Guard fighter wings equipped with the F-15C/D Eagle and USAFE's sole F-15C/D squadron at RAF Lakenheath. =Misawa Air Base= Formation of Block 50A F-16CJs, 90-0812 from the 14th Fighter Squadron identifiable The 35th Fighter Wing was redesignated and reassigned 1 October 1994 when it inactivated at NAS Keflavik and was reactivated the same day at Misawa Air Base, Japan where the wing assumed the missions and responsibilities previously performed by the 432d Fighter Wing. The day following its inactivation in Iceland, the wing was reestablished and redesignated as the 35th Fighter Wing under Pacific Air Forces. The wing serves as host unit for Misawa Air Base, Japan, supporting 33 US associate units and units of the Japan Self-Defense Forces Northern Air Defense Force, primarily the 3rd Air Wing, which celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2007. In addition to providing air defense of northern Japan, the wing has also deployed aircraft and personnel to Southwest Asia in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch and the War on Terror from 1997 to present.

Born in England, he emigrated with his family to Australia as a boy. He was the younger brother of the explorer and politician Augustus Gregory, who also made his career in the colony. Biography Gregory was born at Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, England in 1821. His family, including his older brother Augustus, emigrated to Western Australia in 1829. After getting a basic education, Gregory entered the Western Australian public service in 1841 as a cadet surveyor. In 1846, Gregory accompanied his older brother Augustus and explorer Henry Churchman, to investigate the country north of Perth. The following year, Gregory was appointed an assistant government surveyor; two years later he was promoted to staff surveyor in 1849. In 1857 he led expeditions to the upper Murchison River, and to country farther east and north in 1858. The next year Gregory visited England, to lobby the British government for funding towards exploration of North-West Australia. Gregory believed that the region might support grazing and/or plantation agriculture, based on the use of indentured labour from Asia. In 1860, the Government of Western Australia put Gregory in charge of a proposed expedition to explore the interior around Nickol Bay. The southwestern part of this region was later known as the Pilbara. The British government provided ¬£2,000 towards expenses. The expedition left Fremantle on 23 April 1861. Four days later, at Champion Bay (later Geraldton), Gregory was joined by three volunteers, making a party of nine. They completed the landing of the horses near the Harding River on 24 May, and started inland the following day. After reaching the Fortescue River, the expedition followed it for several days, before turning to the south-west and following the Hardey River. On 25 June, having reached latitude 23¬∞ 56' south, they sought to retrace their steps and reached their landing place on the coast on 19 July. On 29 July, they commenced a second foray, north and east of the previous track. Gregory returned with his party on 17 October and the expedition returned to Perth, which it reached on 9 November 1861. Gregory reported that he had seen between two and three million acres (1.2 million hectares) of land suitable for grazing. He also drew attention to the possibility of a pearling industry being established. As a result of the expedition to Nickol Bay, Gregory was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society (1863). In 1862 Gregory moved to Queensland, where his brother Augustus was already prominent as an explorer and official. Francis Gregory was appointed as a Commissioner of Crown Lands. He married Marion Hume in 1865, the sister of his surveying friend and prot√©g√©, Walter C. Hume. From 1874, he was elected and served as a member of the Queensland Legislative Council. For a short period during 1883, he served as the appointed Postmaster-General of Queensland. Death and legacy Gregory died at Toowoomba on 23 October 1888 and was buried in Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery.Cemeteries Online -- Toowoomba Regional Council. Retrieved 19 February 2015. The exploration journals and records of Augustus and Francis Gregory were published in 1884 by the Queensland government as Journals of Australian Explorations. Harlaxton in Toowoomba, His Toowoomba home, Harlaxton House, is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Acacia gregorii, also known as Gregory's wattle, was collected in the Pilbara during the 1861 expedition, and is named in his honour.

Founder of Moussaieff Jewellers Ltd., he and his wife and business partner, Alisa, were ranked No. 315 on the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, with a fortune estimated at ¬£220 million. Moussaieff produced precious jewellery for international royalty and high society, including Western royalty as well as those from Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf states. He spoke Arabic fluently. In addition, Moussaieff was regarded as one of the world's top private collectors of antiquities associated with the Bible and ancient Near East, with a collection of 60,000 artefacts. Biography Shlomo Moussaieff was the second of 12 children of Rehavia Moussaieff, a Jerusalem- born jewellery dealer. He was named after his grandfather, Shlomo Moussaieff, a wealthy Bukharan merchant who was one of the founders of the Bukharim neighbourhood in Jerusalem in 1891. Rehavia, who later traded in fine gems in Paris, introduced Shlomo to the jewellery trade at a young age. Shlomo's youngest brother, Alon, also became a Jerusalem jewellery dealer. Several of his sisters own jewellery stores: Hannah in Jerusalem's King David Hotel, Naomi in London and Aviva in Geneva. The Tombs of the Sanhedrin His father, a strict disciplinarian, threw him out of the house at the age of 12 because he refused to apply himself to his studies. Moussaieff claims he had dyslexia and was unable to read and write. He began sleeping in synagogues, buses, and even the street, and worked for a carpenter in Sanhedria. After hours, he hung around the Second Temple-era Tombs of the Sanhedrin in the nearby park. Inside the caves, which were then open to the public, he discovered ancient coins that he sold to traders. He also carved up lead coffins and sold the lead in the Armenian Quarter. Apprehended and beaten by an Arab policeman, he was brought before an Arab judge and sentenced to nine months in a reform school in Tulkarm. He asked to learn in a madrassa, where he found it easy to learn the Koran by heart, and became familiar with Arab culture. In 1940 Moussaieff joined the Etzel which opposed British rule in Palestine. Upon the recommendation of his Etzel leader, he joined the British Army at age 17 to fight Nazi Germany during World War II. Stationed in the Egyptian desert and Livorno, Italy, he searched through synagogue genizot (treasuries) during his free time and bought old Kabbalah manuscripts and marriage contracts written by well-known rabbis. In 1947 he rejoined the Etzel to battle the Arab Legion in the Old City of Jerusalem. When the city fell to the Jordanians in 1948, he was taken captive and imprisoned for one year in Transjordan. He married his wife, Alisa, an Austrian native, two weeks before he went into captivity. Business career After his release, Moussaieff worked in his family's jewellery store and opened his own antique jewellery shop in downtown Jerusalem. He supplemented his income by smuggling \\"gold and antiquities from Jordan to Israel\\" in the 1950s. During this time he came in contact with Moshe Dayan, another confirmed antiquities smuggler, and provided Dayan with artefacts in exchange for the use of Dayan's car for transporting smuggled goods. In 1954 he was detained under suspicion of stealing 1,000 coins and other antiquities from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Moussaieff claimed he had \\"paid full price\\" for the items, but would not disclose the seller. He was released after his wife returned the lot to the Jerusalem District Police. In 1963 he moved to London and opened his first jewellery shop in the lobby of the London Hilton on Park Lane. He later opened another store on London's Bond Street. Sales increased in 1967 when wealthy Arabs from Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf began to buy jewelry in London. He and his wife operated the business in partnership; she managed sales while he designed the jewellery. In addition to diamonds, coloured gemstones, and natural pearls, Moussaieff re- set stones and pearls that he acquired at antique jewellery auctions into new jewellery designs. Today Moussaieff Jewellers Ltd. has two London stores and a shop at the Grand Hotel Kempinski Geneve in Switzerland. Moussaieff's clients included government figures such as Imelda Marcos and Princess Ashraf and Princess Shams of Iran, and celebrities such as, Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Stavros Niarchos, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joan Collins, Bob Cummings, Shirley MacLaine, George Raft, Peter Sellers and Frank Sinatra. In the late 1990s he developed a following among affluent Israelis. Moussaieff's collection included rare stones such as the Moussaieff Blue Diamond, a flawless 6.04 carat stone that Alisa purchased at a 2007 Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong for $7.98 million, setting a world record in price per carat, with a final bid of $1.32 million per carat. The Moussaieff Red Diamond, a trilliant cut, 5.11 carat red diamond purchased in 2001 or 2002, is the world's largest known red diamond. Moussaieff retired from the business in 2004 while his wife continued to oversee sales, designs and acquisitions. Antiquities collection Moussaieff was regarded as one of the foremost private collectors of antiquities of the Bible and ancient Near East. According to his own estimate, he owned 60,000 artefacts, specialising in ancient manuscripts and personal seals from the First and Second Temple periods.Deutsch and Lemaire (2000), p. 5. Since he was willing to pay large sums for antiquities that proved the historical authenticity of the Bible, antiquities experts believe that some fakes and forgeries crept into in his collection. In 2004 Moussaieff testified as a victim in a forgery trial involving the James Ossuary and the Jehoash Inscription. Moussaieff had bought two ostracons (inscriptions on pottery shards) from Oded Golan, one of the defendants in the trial; these purchases were also determined to be forgeries. In March 2012 the defendants were acquitted of the forgery charges. Moussaieff was also involved in a seven-year lawsuit filed against him by the Republic of Iraq, accusing him of stealing artefacts from ancient Nineveh after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Though Moussaieff claimed he had bought the antiquities legitimately from a Swiss dealer, he returned them all to the Iraqi government to avoid undue publicity. Recognition and awards Moussaieff received an honorary degree from Bar Ilan University in 2000. The university announced his death in a statement on July 1, 2015. Shlomo Moussaieff was 90. Personal Moussaieff and his wife resided on Grosvenor Square in the Mayfair district of London. They have three daughters:Their eldest, Dorrit, was the former First Lady of Iceland and is married to the former President of Iceland, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson.Their second daughter, Tamar, works in the business. Their third daughter is Sharon..

The stadium is the home field for Tampa Bay Rays spring training operations, as well as its Class-A Florida State League Charlotte Stone Crabs and Rookie-class Gulf Coast Rays teams. Originally built in 1987, the main stadium underwent a renovation that was completed in January 2009 at a cost of $27 million.http://stonecrabsbaseball.com/multimedia/ Prior to the Rays, the stadium was home to Texas Rangers spring training exhibition games and the team's minor league affiliate Charlotte Rangers. The ballpark has also hosted college baseball tournaments and the South Coast League Charlotte County Redfish. Stadium features Charlotte Sports Park has a variety of amenities including a playground area, a boardwalk from foul pole to foul pole, two grass berms for general seating, and a tiki bar. The stadium features four air conditioned suites on the second floor and team store. The third floor of the stadium houses a 17-seat press box, the media dining center, PA booth, camera well, and four broadcast booths. The stadium sits on a complex that also includes five full practice fields, a half field for infield drills, and indoor batting cages. In March 2014, Charlotte Sports Park was named the #1 spring training destination by the readers of USA Today and 10Best.http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-spring-training-facility/ History In the spring of 1993, Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan announced his retirement from the clubhouse at the stadium. During the 1994 Spring Training, the Rangers played host to the Chicago White Sox who featured basketball star Michael Jordan. The game drew a record crowd and was one of only a few sites in Florida to host Jordan. In 2000, after signing an unprecedented 10-year deal worth $252 million with the Texas Rangers, slugger Alex Rodriguez held a press conference with the sports media at the stadium. The stadium was unable to accommodate the significant number of news reporters. In an effort to allow enough room for reporters to speak to Rodriguez, the press conference was held on the roof of the Rangers' dugout, a clear sign that the Rangers had outgrown the facility. They would leave 2 years later. The Rays opened Spring Training at the renovated stadium on February 14, 2009. They lost their first Spring Training game to the Cincinnati Reds on February 25, 7‚Äì0. Their first Spring Training home win came on February 27, a 12‚Äì4 win over the Boston Red Sox. On February 3, 2010, the Rays announced a naming rights deal with The Mosaic Company. The agreement was reported to last through 2024, however due to a potential conflict-of-interest with Charlotte County‚Äîwhom ultimately must approve the name change‚Äîthe Rays asked for more time to study the proposal before giving it to the county commissioners for final approval. On February 17, due to intense opposition by both the Charlotte County Council and local residents, the Rays announced they were abandoning the deal with Mosaic and will potentially look at other companies in the future instead. The stadium has also been used by the local community for non-baseball events like concerts, festivals, and expos. It has hosted such musicians as Kenny Rogers, The Beach Boys, The Little River Band, and Simple Plan. Retired Number 405 Sgt. Wilson Jersey Number 405 is \\"retired\\" at Charlotte Sports Park which was the radio number that belonged to Sgt. Michael Wilson. Sgt.

The community rallied around the Wilson family and turned out in thousands holding signs and waving flags as the funeral procession drove by. On August 13, 2014, the Charlotte Stone Crabs retired Sgt. Wilson's 405 during a pre-game ceremony, with the Wilson family unveiling the jersey shaped sign.

A 2009 poll by satellite navigation firm Garmin named the stretch of the road between Windermere and Keswick as the most popular road in Britain. The 29.8 mile stretch between Kendal and Keswick was also named the UK's best driving road, according to a specially devised driving ratio formulated by car rental firm Avis. Route The road begins (at its southern end) north-west of junction 36 of the M6 motorway at Brettargh Holt roundabout with the A590 road close to Sizergh Castle. It bypasses the town of Kendal as a dual carriageway, this ¬£1.9m section opened on 29 August 1971. It becomes a busy single carriageway road as it enters the Lake District. It bypasses the town of Windermere, closely following the north-eastern bank of Windermere. It then travels through the centre of Ambleside, follows the northern side of Rydal Water, passes White Moss Common, follows the eastern edge of Grasmere and passes the village of Grasmere. The road continues over Dunmail Raise and along the eastern edge of Thirlmere. Shortly afterwards it reaches the town of Keswick. It meets the A66 road at a grade-separated junction. Traffic then bypasses Keswick by following the A66 west for 2.2 km to a roundabout where the A591 resumes, continuing in a roughly north-westerly direction, with fine views over Bassenthwaite Lake. The road terminates at the village of Bothel, on the A595 road The Bothel to Keswick section has many acute bends and is particularly narrow in places, so care is needed when driving on it. =Storm damage and closure= The road was badly damaged during Storm Desmond on 5 December 2015 including a part washed away at Dunmail Raise and landslip adjacent to Thirlmere. The closed section of road between Grasmere and Legburthwaite reopened on 11 May 2016.

It was once controlled by the Mandarin and has fought against Iron Man several times. Publication history Ultimo made a cameo appearance in Tales of Suspense #76 (April 1966) and its first full appearance was in Tales of Suspense #77 (May 1966), and was created by Stan Lee and Gene Colan. Fictional character biography =Origin= A gigantic android that is thousands of years old, Ultimo was constructed by an alien species that has since been destroyed by their own creation, which they called \\"The doomsday device\\", apparently a combat instrument and a weapon of mutual assured destruction. Ultimo confirmed that his \\"masters\\" have not contacted him in \\"thousands of years\\". The first time (chronologically speaking) he is depicted in print, Ultimo is already traveling through space, and has attacked the planet Rajak, ultimately killing all its people. The only survivors, a group of merchants who were off-planet at the time, attempted to destroy him, but had to flee before his might. In the end, they managed to lure him into an asteroid belt, where both he and the ship were battered by space rocks until they were driven off-course and separately crash-landed on an unknown planet ‚Äî Earth. This happened around the 1840s.Iron Man vol. 3 #24 =First appearance= The Mandarin first reveals Ultimo as his \\"greatest creation\\"; later issues suggest that the Mandarin found Ultimo in a long-dormant volcano in the vicinity of the \\"Palace of the Star Dragon\\" in the \\"Valley of the Spirits\\", somewhere in Communist China, and then reprogrammed him as a servant. The Mandarin charged it with geothermal energy inside a volcano and gave him its current name. The giant robot vanquishes a force of Chinese soldiers sent to dispatch the Mandarin and nearly destroys Iron Man, but is drawn back into the volcano. The volcano has been destabilized by his activity and erupts, swallowing the robot whole in a conflagration of red-hot lava.Tales of Suspense #76-78 This proved not to be enough to destroy him, however. Ultimo is then sent by the Mandarin to assist the Living Laser who was attacking Africa, and battled Thor and Hawkeye after emerging from a volcano. He was able to separate Thor from Mjolnir, briefly causing the Asgardian to be Donald Blake, but Hawkeye distracted him long enough for Blake to transform back to Thor, after which Ultimo was knocked into the volcano, which Thor closed.Avengers Annual #1 Ultimo was then sent by the Mandarin to attack the Yellow Claw and Loc Do, and battled Iron Man and Sunfire.Iron Man vol. 1 #69-70 Ultimo was next sent by the Mandarin to attack Washington, D.C. Ultimo fights both Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers, even on the Capitol Mall, before finally being dumped in yet another volcano.Iron Man vol. 1 #95-96 He is not heard from for years after that, until he's revealed to be the cause for a series of earth tremors in California. Over the years, he has drifted across the entire length of the continental plate, soaking up gigantic amounts of geothermal energy, and is thus \\"for the first time in centuries, fully charged\\". The then-current version of Iron Man (the remote-controlled NTU-150) proves no match for Ultimo, and is torn to pieces ‚Äî and the cybernetic backlash to the nervous system renders Tony Stark comatose.Iron Man vol. 1 #298-299 =Ultimo versus Iron Legion= Ultimo battled the \\"Iron Legion\\" which was led by War Machine (Jim Rhodes) and furthermore comprised Happy Hogan, Eddie March (in Iron Man's gray, original suit), Bethany Cabe, Mike O'Brien (in Iron Man's Silver Centurion suit) and Carl Walker (in Iron Man's \\"classic\\" armor); Tony was down and Rhodes had Abe Zimmer take Iron Man's old armors out of storage to be nominally functional again. Since Iron Man's armors would not function anywhere near capacity (having been stored for sentimental reasons only with the idea of never being used again), Rhodes decided on a change of plan against Ultimo. While Happy gets Carl and Eddie to the hospital, and Bethany and Mike head to the town of Futura to start evacuations, Bethany convinced Rhodes to allow to buy time against Ultimo together. At this point, Tony came out of a coma and donned the new Modular Iron Man suit. He headed out to aid in the fight against Ultimo with a Full- Spectrum Scanalyzer and Railgun Launcher. Iron Man successfully took out Ultimo single-handedly, by causing a lightning bolt to strike the robot's \\"central nervous system\\". Iron Man's scans indicated that Ultimo is several thousand years old, and has the robot hauled off for study.Iron Man vol. 1 #300 =Ultimate Devastation= Years later, the robot is the property of Stark-Fujikawa which had bought the Stark company when Tony was believed dead (after the events of \\"the Crossing\\"). Having performed extensive research of the hulking, inert robot, Stark-Fujikawa's engineers managed to access its control programs, and now the company intends to use the enormous energy reserves stored inside Ultimo to provide cheap electricity to the entire Western USA.Iron Man vol. 3 #23 The ship built on top of the dormant doomsday device is attacked by Goldenblade and Sapper ‚Äî ironically, representatives of the doomed Rajaki race, seeking to steal energy to resurrect those Rajaki that still survive as data patterns aboard the crashed vessel - who accidentally wake up Ultimo, and the robot immediately sets out to destroy the ship. Unfortunately, the city of Spokane is on his route, and will be destroyed unless he's stopped. Goldenblade, Sapper, the superheroine Warbird, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the US army all work together with Iron Man to slow the giant down, while Iron Man attempts to use what data Stark-Fujikawa's engineers managed to obtain to break into Ultimo's core programming once more. Moments before the city is reached, Tony manages to convince the giant killer robot of being one of his \\"Masters\\" and orders him to shut down. Afterward, Ultimo is dismantled and his systems \\"fried\\" by the transfer of his energy stores to the Rajaki vessel.Iron Man vol. 3 #25 =Initiative= Ultimo reappeared, apparently fully restored, facing the Mighty Avengers - just long enough to be deactivated by a single shot of the Tactigon, a weapon of unknowable power (at the time) in the hands of a girl called Armory.Avengers: The Initiative #1 (April 2007) =Ultimo virus= Ultimo gets converted into an \\"Ultimo virus\\" capable of bestowing enhanced strength, speed, regeneration and optic blast abilities to its victims, which included Dr. Glenda Sandoval (Rhodey's former love interest) and Ares.War Machine vol. 2 #3 It is revealed that the virus was engineered from Ultimo himself by the Human Engineering Life Laboratories, which was acting on the commission of the Stark Solutions corporation, which had been contracted by H.A.M.M.E.R. to study Ultimo's potential as a weapon. Having destroyed Ultimo's body, War Machine sets out to destroy Ultimo's brain, which had been split up into three discrete units stored at separate locations. Two of the units are destroyed by War Machine's allies, but the third is ingested (in the form of a crystalline liquid) by Stark Solutions' CEO Morgan Stark who is transformed into a giant, humanoid (quicksilver-like) Ultimo and possessed of the Doomsday Machine's programming to destroy all life, fighting War Machine. However, Ultimo's third component is destroyed when War Machine uses Ultimo's own weapons technology - which were obtained when the robot's body was destroyed - against the robot. Morgan then self- destructs, scattering Ultimo's liquid body all over the landscape and merging with the plant life.War Machine vol. 2 #8 Ultimo/Morgan planned to convert all of the vegetation on Earth into metal which would suffocate all life within two weeks. War Machine renders Ultimo docile by forcing Norman Osborn into showing memories of respective happiest moments. However, Osborn then took advantage of this to take Ultimo for himself.War Machine vol. 2 #9 Ultimo (having had his core programming erased) turned into a giant, floating ball of liquid metal that was essentially awaiting instructions. Before Osborn could take possession of the robot, War Machine interfered and then requested Cybermancer Suzi Endo to take Ultimo to \\"raise\\" the blank slate it now is, hopefully instilling other values into the artificial intelligence besides universal genocide.War Machine vol. 2 #10 But on War Machine's request, drops of Ultimo infected the nefarious \\"Bainesville Ten\\" group to see recordings of every person who was raped, tortured or killed from their own orders.War Machine vol. 2 #12 During the \\"Iron Man 2020\\" event, Ultimo is revealed to be the giant that is attacking the island of Lingares. His attack brings him into conflict with Force Works and the local Deathloks.2020 Force Works #2. Marvel Comics. It was revealed that MODOK Superior was responsible for Ultimo's rampage and the creation of the Deathloks of Lingares, and manipulated Force Works into taking out Ultimo's head so that he can take control of its body and become Ulti-MODOK. After the bearded Deathlok was beheaded by U.S. Agent, War Machine temporarily turned into a Deathlok to control the remaining Deathloks into fighting Ulti-MODOK. When Quake briefly opened a lava-filled chasm, Ulti-MODOK fell in with the Deathloks following him down.2020 Force Works #3. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities As a gigantic artificial construction, Ultimo is incredibly strong and nearly indestructible. Despite his bulk, he is very fast, being able to walk at about . He can absorb and store immense amounts of heat energy. He can fire beams of concussive force or beams capable of disintegrating matter from his eyes, the power of which varies with his own energy level (but at full power can easily vaporize several dozen tons of rock in a single blast). He can, over time, significantly increase his size (and presumably strength and durability): when he first appeared, he was tall, but after his years-long lava bath underneath the Earth's crust, he had grown to . After Stark-Fujikawa's engineers accessed his systems, he is made to grow to \\"over a hundred feet\\" (he stretched along the entire length of the hull of a medium-sized research vessel). Ultimo has also shown he can adapt his defenses. While he once was deactivated by a lightning bolt, this later proved ineffective. Finally, he seems capable of repairing himself even when deactivated and completely disassembled. Ultimo has no capacity for self-motivated activity, and is dependent on programming or the commands of its programmer. Ultimo has a standing order for the combat use of its superhuman powers or, as it was rather graphically put: \\"If it moves, it dies. If it resists, it dies first.\\"Iron Man vol.1, #300 Other versions * A modified version of Ultimo exists in the comic book version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a creation of Hydra. This version is created from technology that was recovered from Ultron's destroyed sentries after Avengers: Age of Ultron.Captain America: Road to War #1 In other media =Television= * Ultimo appears in the Iron Man portion of The Marvel Super Heroes. * Ultimo appears in the 1994 Iron Man animated series, voiced by Ed Gilbert. Introduced in the episode \\"Rejoice! I Am Ultimo, Thy Deliverer\\", the Mandarin and MODOK bring the titular android to life after discovering it in an inactive volcano and attach a control device to it so they can use it to attack Iron Man. Ultimo defeats him in the subsequent fight until War Machine destroys the control device, allowing him, Iron Man, and their allies in Force Works to defeat it before it could drain energy from the Earth's core. In the episode \\"Iron Man, On the Inside\\", Ultimo falls under the Hacker's control so he could take revenge on Stark Industries for continuously denying his job applications. When Ultimo attacked Tony Stark and Julia Carpenter, Hawkeye intervened, but was severely injured, forcing Iron Man to use his molecular expander's reverse function to shrink down and save him. While Hacker used the same machine to do the same to Ultimo, Iron Man is able to temporarily shut down the android so he can heal Hawkeye before he and Ultimo are both returned to their normal sizes. Ultimo came back online, but is defeated by Julia and Hawkeye. * Ultimo makes a brief cameo in the 1990s Fantastic Four animated series, as part of a show-within-the-show. * Ultimo appears in Iron Man: Armored Adventures. In the episode \\"Hide and Seek\\", it serves as a Makluan Guardian created by the first Mandarin to guard a Makluan Ring and test his successors' courage. It uses power and force to fuel itself and increase its size whenever someone attacks it. When Gene Khan and Tony Stark claim the ring, they activate Ultimo, who attacks them as part of its test. Once he realizes what the test means, Tony passes, deactivating the android. In the series finale, \\"The Makluan Invasion\\", the Makluan Overlord sends an upgraded version of Ultimo to attack Iron Man, War Machine, Rescue, Nick Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye. During the fight, the Gray Hulk arrives to help the heroes fight it off before Iron Man destroys Ultimo from the inside. * Ultimo makes a cameo appearance in the The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"Iron Man is Born\\". * Ultimo appears in the Avengers: Ultron Revolution episode, \\"Building the Perfect Weapon\\". The Leader sends Ultimo to confront the Avengers while he escapes. Despite Red Hulk's reckless attacks, the Avengers manage to defeat Ultimo. =Video games= * Ultimo appears as a mini-boss and as one of the Mandarin's tools in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance. It also appears in Iron Man's simulation disk and as part of the Mandarin's boss fight. * Ultimo appears in the Iron Man 2 movie tie-in game, voiced by Andrew Chaikin. This version is a large battle suit worn by and fused to Kearson DeWitt of A.I.M., the latter of whom created the suit by stealing and modifying an old version of J.A.R.V.I.S. and combining it with DeWitt's PROTEAN project. Iron Man, War Machine, and S.H.I.E.L.D. join forces to confront and defeat DeWitt / Ultimo. * Ultimo appears as in the Iron Man-themed table's wizard mode in Marvel Pinball. * Ultimo appears as a boss in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, voiced by Jim Meskimen. Prior to the game, Iron Man defeated Ultimo and wiped its mechanical mind before storing it in a warehouse in New Jersey. Ultron uses the Mind Stone to possess Ultimo and wreak havoc on New York City. Ant-Man becomes Giant-Man to distract Ultron / Ultimo while Vision overpowers Ultron's defenses, leaving Ultimo inactive.

He was the founder of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology. Biography Yamashina was born in K≈çjimachi, Tokyo, the second son of Prince Kikumaro Yamashina and Princess Noriko (Kujo) Yamashina. Through his mother, a half-sister of the Crown Princess Sadako, he was the nephew of the then Crown Prince Yoshihito, the future Taish≈ç Emperor. He developed a love of birds at an early age, which were found in abundance on the vast Yamashina estate in Tokyo. He was presented with a stuffed mandarin duck for his sixth birthday present. Yamashina attended the Gakushuin Peer's School, and per the orders of Emperor Meiji entered the Imperial Japanese Army, graduating from the 33rd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy with a specialty in artillery. In 1920, per a revision in the Imperial Household Law, he lost his status as an imperial prince, and became a member of the kazoku with the peerage title of marquis (k≈çshaku) on 20 July. He was promoted to the military rank of lieutenant from the same date, and was also conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. However, he resigned his commission in the Army in 1929 to pursue his interest in zoology, and entered Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in 1931. In 1932, he set up the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology at his home in Shibuya, Tokyo, to house his extensive bird collections, ornithological library, and research facilities. He specialized in research on the avian species of Asia and the Pacific Ocean, and conducted his doctoral research on avian cytology, in affiliation with Hokkaido University. He obtained his doctorate in 1942 with studies on hybrid sterility under Professor Oguma Mamoru of Hokkaido Imperial University. In 1947, he lost his status and noble title with the adoption of the revised Japanese constitution, which abolished the peerage. Afterwards, he devoted considerable effort into genetic research on the chromosomes of birds, and the use of DNA to distinguish between species. In 1984, the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology moved to its present location in Abiko, Chiba. Throughout his career, Yamashina was author of numerous technical papers, and several books. He was co-author of the Handlist of the Japanese Birds, and author of Birds in Japan (1961). In 1981 he described a new species of flightless rail from Okinawa Island. In 1966, he was awarded the Japanese Medal with Purple Ribbon and in 1977 was awarded the Jean Delacour Prize. In 1978 he received the Order of the Golden Ark from the World Wildlife Fund. Among Yamashina's scientific first descriptions are the Okinawa rail, the Daito winter wren, the Rota bridled white-eye, the long-billed white-eye, the Tinian monarch and the Palau owl. Yamashina died on 28 January 1989, aged 88, three weeks after the death of his cousin the Sh≈çwa Emperor. His adopted son was Yamashina Yoshimasa, second son of his sister, Yasuko with Asano Nagatake.

It is related to the total gas yield of the reaction, and the amount of heat produced. Cf. brisance. The strength, or potential, of an explosive is the total work that can be performed by the gas resulting from its explosion, when expanded adiabatically from its original volume, until its pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure and its temperature to 15¬∞C. The potential is therefore the total quantity of heat given off at constant volume when expressed in equivalent work units and is a measure of the strength of the explosive. Explosive strength is measured by, for example, the Trauzl lead block test. An explosion may occur under two general conditions: the first, unconfined, as in the open air where the pressure (atmospheric) is constant; the second, confined, as in a closed chamber where the volume is constant. The same amount of heat energy is liberated in each case, but in the unconfined explosion, a certain amount is used as work energy in pushing back the surrounding air, and therefore is lost as heat. In a confined explosion, where the explosive volume is small (such as occurs in the powder chamber of a firearm), practically all the heat of explosion is conserved as useful energy. If the quantity of heat liberated at constant volume under adiabatic conditions is calculated and converted from heat units to equivalent work units, the potential or capacity for work results. Therefore, if :Qmp represents the total quantity of heat given off by a mole of explosive of 15¬∞C and constant pressure (atmospheric); :Qmv represents the total heat given off by a mole of explosive at 15¬∞C and constant volume; and :W represents the work energy expended in pushing back the surrounding air in an unconfined explosion and thus is not available as net theoretical heat; Then, because of the conversion of energy to work in the constant pressure case, :Qmv = Qmp \\\\+ W from which the value of Qmv may be determined. Subsequently, the potential of a mole of an explosive may be calculated. Using this value, the potential for any other weight of explosive may be determined by simple proportion. Using the principle of the initial and final state, and heat of formation table (resulting from experimental data), the heat released at constant pressure may be readily calculated. :m n :Qmp = viQfi  vkQfk :1 1 where: :Qfi = heat of formation of product i at constant pressure :Qfk = heat of formation of reactant k at constant pressure :v = number of moles of each product/reactants (m is the number of products and n the number of reactants) The work energy expended by the gaseous products of detonation is expressed by: :W = P dv With pressure constant and negligible initial volume, this expression reduces to: :W = P¬∑V2 Since heats of formation are calculated for standard atmospheric pressure (101 325 Pa, where 1 Pa = 1 N/m¬≤) and 15¬∞C, V2 is the volume occupied by the product gases under these conditions. At this point :W/mol = (101 325 N/m¬≤)(23.63 l/mol)(1 m¬≥/1000 l) = 2394 N¬∑m/mol = 2394 J/mol and by applying the appropriate conversion factors, work can be converted to units of kilocalories. :W/mol = 0.572 kcal/mol Once the chemical reaction has been balanced, one can calculate the volume of gas produced and the work of expansion. With this completed, the calculations necessary to determine potential may be accomplished. For TNT: :C6H2(NO2)3CH3 ‚Üí 6CO + 2.5H2 \\\\+ 1.5N2 \\\\+ C for 10 mol Then: :Qmp = 6(26.43) ‚Äì 16.5 = 142.08 kcal/mol Note: Elements in their natural state (H2, O2, N2, C, etc.) are used as the basis for heat of formation tables and are assigned a value of zero. See table 12-2. :Qmv = 142.08 + 0.572(10) = 147.8 kcal/mol As previously stated, Qmv converted to equivalent work units is the potential of the explosive. (MW = Molecular Weight of Explosive) :Potential = Qmv kcal/mol √ó 4185 J/kcal √ó 103 g/kg √ó 1 mol/(mol¬∑g) :Potential = Qmv (4.185 √ó 106) J/(mol¬∑kg) For TNT, :Potential = 147.8 (4.185 √ó 106)/227.1 = 2.72 √ó 106 J/kg Rather than tabulate such large numbers, in the field of explosives, TNT is taken as the standard explosive, and others are assigned strengths relative to that of TNT. The potential of TNT has been calculated above to be 2.72 √ó 106 J/kg.

During the Hitler era, he executed numerous people who were sentenced to death for resisting National Socialism.  Life and career  Johann Reichhart was born in Wichenbach near W√∂rth an der Donau into a family of Bavarian knackers and executioners, including his uncle Franz Xaver Reichhart and brother Michael, that went back eight generations to the mid- eighteenth century. His father (d. 1902) had a small farm on a remote land in Wichenbach near Tiefenthal (W√∂rth an der Donau) and took on extra work as a master knacker. Reichhart attended the Volks-school and vocational school in W√∂rth an der Donau, both of which he completed successfully. He then completed an apprenticeship as butcher, and served as a soldier in the First World War. =Beginnings as an executioner in the Weimar Republic= In April 1924, Reichhart took over the office of state judicial executioner in the Free State of Bavaria from his uncle Franz Xaver Reichhart (1851-1934), who retired at age 70. For each execution, Reichhart was paid 150 Goldmark plus ten marks for daily expenses, and given a 3rd-class railway ticket. For executions in the Palatinate (Pfalz), he was dispatched by express train. Executions decreased during 1924‚Äì1928, and Reichhart executed only 23 people (only one in 1928), and he had difficulty making a living for his family. He negotiated the right to take on other work domestically and abroad, and was released from the requirement of local residence. His business ventures failed, however; he gave up his wagon transport business in 1925, and in 1926 his inn at Mariahilfplatz. He sold Catholic treatises in Upper Bavaria as a traveling salesman. In 1928, he attempted but failed to resolve his contract with the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. He moved his residence to The Hague and became a successful independent greengrocer. In the spring of 1931 and in July 1932, Reichhart travelled to Munich to carry out death sentences at Stadelheim Prison. In July 1932, several Dutch newspapers described his \\"other activities\\" and revealed his identity, which was normally kept incognito. As a result, Reichhart's business dwindled, and in the spring of 1933 he returned to Munich, where he considered ending his work as executioner. =National Socialism= On 22 June 1933, following the seizure of power by the National Socialists, Reichhart signed a new contract with the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. He now received a fixed, significantly higher annual salary, paid monthly. On 18 July 1933, following a request from the Ministry of Justice for Saxony, Reichhart was also authorized to execute in the state of Saxony and received a flat fee for \\"each occurrence\\". The guillotine (Fallschwertmaschine) and assistants were provided to him by the Free State of Saxony at the execution sites in Dresden and Weimar. In January 1934, the Bavarian judiciary raised his annual income to 3,720 Reichsmark, and he no longer needed to worry about his financial security. From 1 September 1933, Reichhart joined the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), the National Socialist War Victim's Care (NSKOV), the National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) and the German Labour Front (DAF). In April 1937 he joined the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). The Reich Ministry of Justice (Reichsjustizministerium), by decree of 25 August 1937, reassigned its areas of responsibility and named three executioners. was responsible for the central execution sites in Berlin, Breslau and K√∂nigsberg; was responsible for executions in Butzbach, Hamburg, Hanover and Cologne; and Reichhart was named for executions in Munich, Dresden, Stuttgart and Weimar. On 19 February 1939, after the annexation of Austria, the Reich Minister of Justice ordered a change of territories: Reichhart gave Weimar to Friedrich Hehr, and added Vienna and Frankfurt to his territories (Frankfurt replacing Butzbach). Reichhart temporarily suffered from depression. During his service, Reichhart worked to accelerate the execution process and make it \\"less stressful\\" for convicted people. Beginning around 1939, he had the tipping board (bascule) on the guillotine replaced by a fixed bench. The condemned was held by his assistants, without restraint devices, until the hatchet blade was dropped. Reichhart abolished the black blindfold; instead, one of his assistants held the convict's eyes closed. These measures shortened the duration of the actual execution to 3‚Äì4 seconds (time specified by Johann Reichhart). Reichhart also carried out executions in Cologne, Frankfurt-Preungesheim, Berlin-Pl√∂tzensee, Brandenburg-G√∂rden and Breslau, where central execution sites had also been constructed. From 1938 to 1944 he was also executioner for central execution sites in Vienna and Graz. From 1924 on, during the Weimar Republic and the period of National Socialism, he executed 2,951 people (250 of them women) via guillotine, and 59 by hanging. He also executed Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl (d. 22 February 1943), the most famous members of the resistance group White Rose (see also Hans and Sophie Scholl). Reichhart later said that he had never seen anyone die as bravely as Sophie Scholl. After the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944, the number of executions rose sharply. In December 1944, in the administrative divisions of central execution centres, Reichhart was designated as the executioner of the \\"execution centre for the execution district VIII\\", which included Munich-Stadelheim (Stadelheim Prison), Remand Prison Stuttgart and Penitentiary Bruchsal. =Executioner for the US Military Government= Following VE Day, Reichhart, a member of the NSDAP, was arrested by members of the United States Army and spent one week in Stadelheim Prison for the purposes of denazification. He was not tried for carrying out his official duties as judicial executioner. He was subsequently employed by the U.S. Office of Military Government, until the end of May 1946, to help execute 156 Nazi war criminals on the gallows at Landsberg am Lech. The technique required for this must have been known to him since 1942 at the latest, when he submitted a design proposal for British-style gallows with trapdoor (Long drop), which was rejected by the Reich Ministry of Justice (hanging was introduced as an additional form of execution on 29 March 1933 by President Hindenburg after the Reichstag Fire). With hanging executions during the Third Reich era, Reichhart had to work with the Austro-Hungarian short drop pole method of strangulation hanging (': strangulation gallows). In August 1945, Reichhart was denounced by the Munich city administration. He lived comfortably in a villa and had several cars. Formally, he was still a judicial executioner of the Free State of Bavaria without acting in this capacity. At the end of May 1946, Reichhart learned that he had executed two innocent people due to mistaken identity.Frei, Andreas (29 January 2014) \\"Johann Reichhart: Bayerns letzter Henker\\" Augsburger Allgemeine He subsequently retired as an executioner and served only as a consultant. He assisted American master sergeant John C. Woods in managing the gallows, and was commissioned by the United States Military Government to supervise the construction of the gallows in Nuremberg. On 16 October 1946, Woods hanged the war criminals convicted in the Nuremberg trials, assisted by Joseph Malta. =Post-executioner life= In May 1947, Reichhart was imprisoned again. After a denazification trial process in Munich in December 1948, he was \\"incriminated\\" and sentenced to two years in a labour camp and confiscation of half of his assets. Following an appeal, the sentence was reduced to one and a half years and confiscation of 30% of his property. Since his time in custody by then exceeded the prison sentence, Reichhart was subsequently released. Reichhart's profession made him a lonely person. His marriage failed. His son, Hans, dispirited by his father's occupation and the denazification trial, committed suicide in 1950. Impoverished and despised by many, Reichhart lived on a small military pension from the First World War. In 1963, during a series of murders of taxi drivers, when public demands increased for the reintroduction of capital punishment, Reichhart spoke out against the death penalty. Quote: Nach 3010 Exekutionen und mit 71 Jahren ist Johann Reichhart heute ein Gegner der Todesstrafe. (\\"At 71 years old and after 3010 executions, Johann Reichhart is now against the death penalty.\\") Reichhart was temporarily confined in psychiatric hospital. He died on 26 April 1972, at a hospital in Dorfen, at the age of 78. =Aftermath= In early 2014, it was determined that a guillotine found at the Bavarian National Museum was probably the one which Reichhart had used to execute the Scholls.

Netrani (historically known as Pigeon Island and also Heart Shape Island) is a small island of India located in the Arabian Sea. It is off the coast of Karnataka situated approximately from the temple town of Murudeshwara in Bhatkal Taluka. The island can be seen from the main coast over 15 km away, including from various beaches in Bhatkal city as well as from the Murudeshwar Beach. Views above give this island the appearance of being heart-shaped. Besides pigeons, the other inhabitants of the island are wild goats. This island has scuba diving facilities and the place is easily accessible from Bhatkal, Mangalore, Goa, Mumbai or Bangalore. There are dive shops at Murdeshwara and Goa, that regularly organize diving tripes to the island. Those that do not want to dive can just visit the island and hike in by hiring the full fishing motor boat at the Bhatkal Fishing Harbour/Bunder. It would be beneficial if in big groups. This place is Locally in Bhatkal city known as Nitra Gudo. Coral reef Netrani is a coral island which has a coral reef with many varieties of coral, butterfly fish, trigger fish, parrot fish, eels and shrimps can be seen here. Divers have also reported seeing orcas and whale sharks around the island. Normally diving/snorkelling is done from a boat which is anchored close to the island and usually visitors do not climb on to the island because of the sharp rocks and steep cliffs on the island. The Indian government was using this island for target practice for its armed forces. One can still find craters and unexploded bomb shells in the island. Fish eagles are thriving in this island primarily feeding on sea snakes and fish. A species of mongoose was also spotted in the island confirming mammalian inhabitants apart from bats. Whale sharks were also spotted by snorkellers. Eighty nine varieties of coral fish were found in the area during a study. This island offers diving suitable for professionals. Corals are a fragile ecosystem and calls for minimal anthropogenic interference. The growing concerns of climate change need to be addressed earnestly. A rock is used as a target by Indian navy for bombing and concerns were raised that this target practice is disestablishing the ecological balance of the area including that of Netrani Island. In 2012, Karnataka High Court issued stay on target practice and Naval authorities admitted that they are using a big rock, which is located at a distance of is being used by them for bombarding during target practice. One can see empty shells rusting around Netrani and adjacent island. It is not recommended to visit Netrani without permission. The best time to visit is between December and January. The resort stops taking tourists for snorkelling and scuba diving during June‚ÄìSeptember because the sea becomes rough. There are small shrines in the island and the light lit to offer pooja occasionally gives way to small-time forest fire in the island. =Scuba Diving= Netrani Island has some of the best diving on the west coast of India. The dive sites are not comparable to the Andaman Islands. The visibility is in the 15 to 20 meter range. There are healthy coral reefs and a huge variety of reef fish around the island. After a brief period when the local fishermen protested against scuba diving, saying that Scuba diving has driven away the abundant fish they once used to catch regularly, Scuba diving is now being actively promoted by the Karnataka Tourism.

Retrieved 13 December 2019 History The success of Pentland Group can be traced back to August 1981, when Pentland Industries acquired 55% of Reebok for 77,500. By 1983/84, Reebok accounted for 70% of Pentland's turnover. Pentland's shares rose from 0.55 at the start of 1984 to 3 by the end of the year, and up to 10 in June 1985, while profits rose from 1 million in 1983 to 12.9 million in 1985. Pentland then listed 60% of Reebok in a flotation valuing the company at 300 million. Stephen Rubin began working alongside his father at Pentland at the age of 21. He later became chairman and chief executive of Pentland, remaining so until 1998 when he split his role and appointed his son, Andrew, as chief executive. Pentland was taken private in 1999 to focus on longer-term investments. However, according to an article in The Independent, City institutions were unhappy with the way Rubin was running the company, which \\"underperformed the market by 40% since it floated in 1989\\". Pentland Group acquired 45% of JD Sports Fashion plc from its founders, John Wardle and David Makin, in May 2005. Pentland Group is now the majority owner of JD Sports (55%), which has 2,500 retail outlets worldwide, including JD, Scotts, Size, Blacks, GO Outdoors and Millets in the UK.

Spencer's book, published 1866 Spencerian Script is a script style that was used in the United States from approximately 1850 to 1925 and was considered the American de facto standard writing style for business correspondence prior to the widespread adoption of the typewriter. Platt Rogers Spencer, whose name the style bears, used various existing scripts as inspiration to develop a unique oval-based penmanship style that could be written very quickly and legibly to aid in matters of business correspondence as well as elegant personal letter- writing. Spencerian Script was developed in 1840, and began soon after to be taught in the school Spencer established specifically for that purpose. He quickly turned out graduates who left his school to start replicas of it abroad, and Spencerian Script thus began to reach the common schools. Spencer never saw the great success that his penmanship style enjoyed because he died in 1864, but his sons took upon themselves the mission of bringing their late father's dream to fruition.Brian Walker, \\"Spencerian and Ornamental Penmanship,\\" Pen People Magazine (4 April 2004) This they did by distributing Spencer's previously unpublished book, Spencerian Key to Practical Penmanship, in 1866.

Design and development The ZT3 and its launch system was developed under the codename \\"Project Raleigh\\" in the 1980s as a \\"long-range indigenous antitank guided missile\\". The missile was developed to provide the South African Army's mechanized infantry vehicles, such as the Ratel IFV, with anti-tank capabilities and to supplement the ageing MILAN missile system that was in service at the time. Pre-production models, mounted in a triple launcher on top of a Ratel IFV, saw service in Operation Moduler during the South African Border War with good effect. Ratel IFV with Ingwe launcher on top and missile in front (on ground). In the years since, Denel Dynamics have continually upgraded the system to improve its range, accuracy, reliability and warhead effectiveness. In May 2010, Denel Dynamics and Rheinmetall Denel Munitions were working on a new series of multi-purpose warheads for the missile system. Denel stated that due to changing trends in warfare in recent years, customers required a \\"generic precision land-attack missile\\" that can be used against a variety of targets such as buildings and bunkers. Denel is also developing the missile system for use on the Badger Infantry Fighting Vehicle that will enter service with the South African Army as part of Project Hoefyster. The company has also collaborated with the French-South African company, ATE, to integrate the missile system for use on helicopter platforms such as the Eurocopter EC635, the MI-24 Mk III Super Hind and Eurocopter Fennec for use in various Air Forces around the world. Several missile systems in use with the South African Army were also modernised in 2005 as part of Project Adrift. In February 2013, Denel unveiled a new version of the system at the International Defence Exhibition held in Abu Dhabi. The new system, called the Portable Launch System (IPLS), is a portable, light-weight launch system that comprises a new missile launch unit designed for use on light vehicle mounts or tripods. It can fire both HEAT (High Explosive Anti-Tank) and Multi-Purpose Penetrator versions of the Ingwe. The system consists of a laser projection unit and guidance and control units. The system uses a laser beam riding missile that automatically determines its own position in the laser beam and manoeuvres onto its Line-of-sight (LOS). The sighting system varies from a non-stabilised optic system for light vehicles to a stabilised day/night system on helicopter launch systems. Automatic targeting modules can also be added to the missile system that can be added to ensure fully automatic post-lock on missile guidance by the operator. The missile can engage targets at ranges from 250 m to . It employs a tandem warhead to defeat up to of armour. The missile is also designed to be stealthy (virtually hard to detect) and highly resistant to countermeasures.

The strip debuted in the very first issue of Roy of the Rovers, dated 25 September 1976, and, apart from a break of approximately three months in 1985, ran until a re-launch of the comic in 1986 saw most of the existing strips replaced, by which time it was the only remaining story from the comic's original line-up apart from the story of Roy himself. The final episode appeared in the issue dated 16 August 1986. The strip was usually written by Fred Baker and drawn by Ramiro Bujeiro. Episodes also appeared in many of the Roy of the Rovers annuals. Story overview The story centred on teenager Tommy Barnes, who longed to be a professional footballer but had the misfortune to be sent to Crowhust School, where only rugby was played. After a concerted campaign by Tommy and his pal Ginger Collins, the headmaster agreed to allow a school football team to be formed on the condition that Tommy was able to get into the school rugby team, which he eventually did. Later, Tommy and Ginger formed their own football club, Barnes United, and entered a local league. They persuaded the local council to allow them the use of some disused tennis courts, where they laid their own pitch and built their own clubhouse. Tommy and his team were frequently beset by all manner of \\"troubles\\", such as not being able to raise a team or having to hitch-hike to away games as they could not afford public transport. They also made enemies of two of Crowhurst's top rugby players, the conniving Adam Waller and his slow-witted sidekick Cyril Swate. Waller and Swate spent most of their time orchestrating various schemes to make Tommy and his teammates' lives miserable, although Waller invariably got his come- uppance. A memorable storyline of this type saw United enter a team in a five- a-side tournament, prompting Waller to enter a team of tough rugby players, his plan being to rough up the United players. The United players' superior skills nonetheless allowed them to defeat the rugby players without great difficulty, and Waller ended up having to pay the tournament fees for his entire team. =The end of the original run= In the summer of 1985, however, Waller finally got the better of Tommy when he managed to persuade the local council that Barnes United had disbanded, with the result that the council gave the use of their pitch to a girls' hockey team. Facing expulsion from the league without a ground on which to play, Tommy learned of a long-disused ground on the edge of town which had once been used by a local non-league team. The United players took over the ground and renovated it, allowing them to begin the new league season. After just a couple of matches, however, the owner of the land on which the ground stood made his presence known, and ordered the team to vacate it. At the same time Tommy learnt that his father's job had been relocated and he would have to move to a different part of the country. With the other players feeling that Barnes United could not continue without him, Tommy left them with a parting message of \\"Never let your troubles get you down\\" and the strip came to an end. =The strip's return= Just a few months later, however, the strip made a return, apparently by popular demand. It was revealed that Barnes United had decided to continue after all after being allowed the use of a field by a local farmer. Without Tommy, however, they were rooted to the bottom of the league and the farmer would not allow them anything other than run-down old sheds in which to change. Just before Christmas, however, Tommy returned, having moved back to Crowhurst for reasons which were not made clear. He made his return to the Barnes United team wearing a mask and calling himself \\"The Masked Avenger\\", so as to allow for a dramatic unmasking at the end of the first episode. The strip's second run followed the same tone as the first, mixing on-field action with Tommy and his friends' various off-field \\"scrapes\\", which were usually engineered by Waller and Swate. United lost another ground when the farmer developed its facilities and then gave its use to a men's team, but they found and renovated yet another ground, financing the work via a 24-hour sponsored penalty shootout. The strip came to an end in 1986 with a final storyline in which Tommy's teammates came to believe that he was contemplating quitting football, but in the final episode he revealed that he'd always be playing football, whatever his \\"troubles\\".

He was selected for Fiji's squad at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He represented Fiji in four matches at the World Cup. In 2004 he was capped twice for Fiji in games against Samoa and Tonga; these two games were actually 2007 World Cup qualifying matches, and Rauluni skippered Fiji on both occasions. In July of that year he was selected as part of the Pacific Islanders side, which was a touring team composed of the best Fijian, Samoan and Tongan players. The Pacific Islanders played matches against South Africa, Australia and the All Blacks. He was capped nine times during 2005. In May 2006 he re-signed with the Saracens until the 2007/08 season. He was a key to help Fiji to reach the quarterfinal at the 2007 RWC. Some regarded him as the half back of the tournament. He was forced to retire due to injury in June 2010 and later, later being recruited by Sam Domoni, the Flying Fijians head coach, ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, which would see Rauluni coach the backs. In June 2010 he coached the Saracens academy side, with Kevin Sorrell, before becoming head coach of Harrow School, an English private school. He returned to Fiji in 2014, joining the new coaching set up under John McKee of which Rauluni and McKee guided Fiji to qualification to the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He is now the Defensive and skills coach with the national team.\\"The Vodafone Flying Fijians coaching team\\" References External links *Saracens profile *Scrum profile *Fiji profile *Pacific Islanders profile 1975 births Fijian rugby union coaches Fijian rugby union players Living people Rugby union scrum-halves Saracens F.C. players Fiji international rugby union players Pacific Islanders rugby union players Fijian expatriate rugby union players Expatriate rugby union players in Australia Expatriate rugby union players in New Zealand Expatriate rugby union players in England Fijian expatriate sportspeople in Australia Fijian expatriate sportspeople in New Zealand Fijian expatriate sportspeople in the United Kingdom People educated at Brisbane State High School People from Brisbane Sportspeople from Suva I-Taukei Fijian people ","title":"Mosese Rauluni"},{"id":"5730262","text":"Al-Ahly Sports Cultural & Social Club () known as Al-Ahly SCSC is a Libyan Sports club based in Benghazi, Libya. Al-Ahly SC has its roots in a political party, the Omar al Mukhtar society. History Al-Ahly SC Libya was made a professional football club in 1947, although they had existed years before then. Al Ahly is the most supported club in Benghazi and is famous in Libya for its passionate, loyal and sometimes violent crowds, who stood by the club through frustrating times. In 2000, the club's headquarters and training complex was demolished by the Libyan government, supposedly destroying records, trophies and medals of the club. The demolition was allegedly carried out in response to Al-Ahly fans insulting Saadi Gaddafi by dressing a donkey in a shirt baring his squad number, but other sources pointed to the burning a few days before of the Libyan Football Federation offices in Benghazi by angry Al-Ahly fans as the matter.Col. Muammar al-Gaddafi, His Son and the Politics of Libyan Soccer Bleacher Report, 23 February 2011 The club was then given an indefinite ban which lasted until 2005. Saadi Gadafi had denied all the allegations. The club has been given of land for a new ground by the Libyan Jamahiriya government, although it cannot afford to develop it. Al Ahly is one of the biggest clubs in Libya, and along with Tripoli's two big clubs.

Biography Born in Belfast, much of his youth was spent in Glasgow. His father James was professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow from 1832 onward and his younger brother William was to become Baron Kelvin. James attended Glasgow University from a young age and graduated (1839) with high honours in his late teens. After graduation, he served brief apprenticeships with practical engineers in several domains; and then gave a considerable amount of his time to theoretical and mathematical engineering studies, often in collaboration with his brother, during his twenties in Glasgow. In his late twenties he entered into private practice as a professional engineer with special expertise in water transport. In his early thirties, in 1855, he was appointed professor of civil engineering at Queen's University Belfast. He remained there until 1873, when he accepted the Regius professorship of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Glasgow (in which post he was successor to the influential William Rankine) until he resigned with failing eyesight in 1889. In 1875 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were his younger brother William Thomson, Peter Guthrie Tait, Alexander Crum Brown, and John Hutton Balfour. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in June 1877. He served as President of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland from 1884 to 1886. In later life he lived at 2 Florentine Gardens, off Hillhead Street.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1889-90 He died of cholera in Glasgow on 8 May 1892. He is buried on the northern slopes of the Glasgow Necropolis overlooking Glasgow Cathedral. One obituary described Thomson as ‚Äúa man of singular purity of mind and simplicity of character‚Äú, whose ‚Äúgentle kindness and unfailing courtesy will be long remembered.‚Äù Legacy James Thomson is known for his work on the improvement of water wheels, water pumps and turbines. Also his innovations in the analysis of regelation, i.e., the effect of pressure on the freezing point of water, and his studies in glaciology including glacier motion, where he extended the work of James David Forbes. He studied the experimental work of his colleague Thomas Andrews, concerning the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states of matter, and strengthened understanding of it by applying his strong knowledge of thermodynamics. He derived a simplified form of the Clapeyron equation for the solid-liquid phase boundary. He proposed the term triple point to describe the conditions for which solid, liquid and vapour states are all in equilibrium.James Thomson (1873) \\"A quantitative investigation of certain relations between the gaseous, the liquid, and the solid states of water-substance,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society, 22 : 27‚Äì36. From a footnote on page 28: \\" ‚Ä¶ the three curves would meet or cross each other in one point, which I have called the triple point.\\" He also had contributions in the realm of fluid dynamics of rivers. It is claimed that the term torque was introduced into English scientific literature by Thomson, in 1884. Publications James Thomson's main published research reports in physics and engineering were republished as a 500-page collection after his death. The collection is freely available online (see below) and is prefaced by a lengthy (80 page) biography plus a more concise (10 page) biography. It is stated in this book that Thomson is the first to use the words radian, interface and apocentric in English, though he used a number of other neologisms that have not survived.

By using the eyes in this way the field of view is increased, while depth perception is limited. The eyes of an horse with monocular vision are positioned on opposite sides of the animal's head, giving it the ability to see two objects at once. The word monocular comes from the Greek root, mono for single, and the Latin root, oculus for eye. Related medical conditions Monocular vision impairment refers to having no vision in one eye with adequate vision in the other.http://www.guidedogsqld.com.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi/monocular/mvi Monopsia is a medical condition in humans who cannot perceive three-dimensionally even though their two eyes are medically normal, healthy, and spaced apart in a normal way. Vision that perceives three-dimensional depth requires more than parallax. In addition, the resolution of the two disparate images, though highly similar, must be simultaneous, subconscious, and complete. (After- images and \\"phantom\\" images are symptoms of incomplete visual resolution, even though the eyes themselves exhibit remarkable acuity.) A feature article in The New Yorker magazine published in early 2006 dealt with one individual in particular, who, learning to cope with her disability, eventually learned how to see three-dimensional depth in her daily life. Medical tests are available for determining monoptic conditions in humans.Monocular individuals face increased challenges with driving. These specifically relate to depth perception and peripheral vision. Keeney, et al., state, \\"nationwide, monocularly impaired individuals have seven times more accidents than the general population with which they were compared.\\" He recommends monocularly impaired drivers be denied class 1 licenses, (commercial driver license for transport of people), and that they be warned by their doctors regarding increased risk of accident with driving Monocular cues Monocular cues provide depth information when viewing a scene with one eye. * Motion parallax ‚Äì When an observer moves, the apparent relative motion of several stationary objects against a background gives hints about their relative distance. If information about the direction and velocity of movement is known, motion parallax can provide absolute depth information.Ferris, S. H. (1972). Motion parallax and absolute distance. Journal of experimental psychology, 95(2), 258 --63. This effect can be seen clearly when driving in a car nearby things pass quickly, while distant objects appear stationary. Some animals that lack binocular vision because of the wide placement of the eyes employ parallax more explicitly than humans for depth cueing (e.g., some types of birds, which bob their heads to achieve motion parallax, and squirrels, which move in lines orthogonal to an object of interest to do the same).1 * Depth from motion ‚Äì One form of depth from motion, kinetic depth perception, is determined by dynamically changing object size. As objects in motion become smaller, they appear to recede into the distance; objects in motion that appear to be getting larger seem to be coming closer. Using kinetic depth perception enables the brain to calculate time-to-crash (aka time-to-collision or time- to-contact ‚Äì TTC) at a particular velocity. When driving, one is constantly judging the dynamically changing headway (TTC) by kinetic depth perception. * Perspective ‚Äì The property of parallel lines converging at infinity allows us to reconstruct the relative distance of different parts of a scene, or of landscape features. * Relative size ‚Äì If two objects are known to be the same size (e.g. two trees) but their absolute size is unknown, relative size cues can provide information about the relative depth of the two objects. If one subtends a larger visual angle on the retina than the other, the object which subtends the larger visual angle appears closer. * Familiar size ‚Äì Since the visual angle of an object projected onto the retina decreases with distance, this information can be combined with previous knowledge of the objects size to determine the absolute depth of the object. For example, people are generally familiar with the size of an average automobile. This prior knowledge can be combined with information about the angle it subtends on the retina to determine the absolute depth of an automobile in a scene. * Aerial perspective ‚Äì Owing to light scattering by particles in the atmosphere, objects at a distance have lower luminance contrast and lower color saturation. In computer graphics, this is called \\"distance fog\\". The foreground has high contrast; the background has low contrast. Objects differing only in their contrast with a background appear to be at different depths.O‚ÄôShea, R. P., Blackburn, S. G., & Ono, H. (1994). Contrast as a depth cue. Vision Research, 34, 1595-1604. The colors of distant objects are also shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum (e.g., distance mountains). Some painters, notably C√©zanne, employ \\"warm\\" pigments (red, yellow and orange) to bring features towards the viewer, and \\"cool\\" ones (blue, violet, and blue- green) to indicate the part of a form that curves away from the picture plane. * Accommodation ‚Äì This is an oculomotor cue for depth perception. When we try to focus on distant objects, the ciliary muscles relax allowing the eye lens to flatten, making it thinner. The kinesthetic sensations of the contracting and relaxing ciliary muscles (intraocular muscles) is sent to the visual cortex where it is used for interpreting distance/depth. * Occlusion (also referred to as interposition) ‚Äì Occlusion (blocking the sight) of objects by others is also a clue which provides information about relative distance. However, this information allows the observer to assess only relative distance. * Peripheral vision ‚Äì At the outer extremes of the visual field, parallel lines become curved, as in a photo taken through a fish-eye lens. This effect, although usually eliminated from both art and photos by the cropping or framing of a picture, greatly enhances the viewer's sense of being positioned within a real, three-dimensional space. (Classical perspective has no use for this \\"distortion\\", although in fact the \\"distortions\\" strictly obey optical laws and provide perfectly valid visual information, just as classical perspective does for the part of the field of vision that falls within its frame.) * Texture gradient ‚Äì Suppose you are standing on a gravel road. The gravel near you can be clearly seen in terms of shape, size and colour. As your vision shifts towards the more distant part of the road it becomes progressively less easy to distinguish the texture. Recent advances in computational machine learning now allow monocular depth for an entire scene to be algorithmically estimated from a single digital image by implicitly using one or more of these cues . Balance Vision has been known to play an important role in balance and postural control in humans, along with proprioception and vestibular function. Monocular vision affects how the brain perceives its surroundings by decreasing the available visual field, impairing peripheral vision on one side of the body, and compromising depth perception, all three of which are major contributors to the role of vision in balance.Berela, J. et al. (2011) Use of monocular and binocular visual cues for postural control in children. Journal of Vision. 11(12):10, 1-8Wade, M. and Jones, G.

In addition to uranium, molybdenum, manganese, and brown coal are also mined in the town's vicinity, with associated chemical plants producing sulfuric acid and lubricants. =Transport= A branch railway has connected the town to Russia's rail network since 1972. Krasnokamensk is served by the Krasnokamensk Airport. Climate Krasnokamensk has a severe boreal climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dwc). It is monsoon influenced and very closely borders a humid continental climate (Dwb). The summers are short but very warm (and humid). Winters are very long, extremely dry and severely cold. Pollution According to the Blacksmith Institute, Krasnokamensk has generated fifty to seventy-five million tons of tailings, making it the largest waste stream at a uranium production site in the world. A Baley community survey documents hundreds of homes with radiation levels as much as 10-20 times the permissible levels. About 500-1000 homes or more suffer from radiation exposures far above international standards.http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org Blacksmith Institute Website In recent years, the dangerously high levels of radioactivity led to evacuation and resettlement of residents living near the tailing dumps.

It is owned by the Connecticut Airport Authority. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021 categorized it as a regional reliever airport facility. The airport is named after former mayor Newton C. Brainard. History Originally called Brainard Field when it opened in 1921, Hartford‚ÄìBrainard Airport may well be the country's first municipal airport. Located in a former cow pasture in the southeast Hartford Neighborhood of South Meadows, Brainard opened in 1921. Among the facility's claims to fame are visits by some of the early 20th century's greatest aviators ‚Äî including Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh ‚Äî who landed there to great acclaim. For its first decade, officials limited the airfield's use primarily to small passenger flights, but in 1933, city officials opened Brainard to commercial traffic. Passenger airlines, such as Eastern Airlines, and Colonial Airlines served Brainard. But the airport couldn't handle the large Douglas DC-3 and heavier planes that became common by the 1930s. The weight of the planes was too much for just grass. Later, the city installed a blacktop runway. Additionally, Brainard could not accommodate large aircraft because its runways are too short and the airport's proximity to Connecticut River also meant fog problems. As a result, larger aviation began to move to the new Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks after it opened in 1952, and by 1958 all commercial carriers had relocated. No longer the principal airport for the Greater Hartford area, the Hartford city council voted for closure. In 1959, the next year the state and the city of Hartford entered into an agreement that year giving control of the airport to the state. A large runway was taken for the development of the South Meadows commercial and industrial district off Brainard Road and reduced the airport's size to 201 acres (81.3 ha). Today, Brainard serves as the reliever airport for Bradley Airport. It has approximately 360 people working at the various airport-related businesses and government agencies based on-site. Some city and state officials favor redeveloping the Hartford South Meadows, including the airport, with offices, commercial and retail space, apartments, a marina, a riverwalk system and perhaps a modern energy plant.

History In 1838, a French craftsman named Jean Bardou came up with the idea for a booklet of rolling papers made of thin, pure rice paper. Bardou's trademark was the initials \\"JB\\" separated by a large diamond. The diamond was often mistaken for a capital O by consumers, who began referring to the papers as JOB, thus the brand-name was born. Les tr√®s riches heures du papier √† rouler: regards sur une collection - Mus√©e du papier d'Angoul√™me By 1849 he filed for a patent for \\"Papier JOB\\". JOB History - Sept Deniers Jean Bardou died in 1852. The JOB brand was auctioned in August 1853 and bought for 16,000 francs by Jean Bardou's son Pierre Bardou. His brother Joseph Bardou had formed a separate company making \\"le Nil\\" cigarette papers, with a laughing elephant as its logo. In January 1854 Pierre began making his own paper in Perpignan. A range of flavored papers included licorice, anise, vanilla, juniper, camphor and so on. Careful attention to marketing included development of premium or luxury papers, with attractive boxes designed for ladies. At the end of 1858 Pierre Bardou bought a large house at 18 rue St Sauveur in Perpignan for 40,000 francs, originally an apartment building, which he divided into one area for manufacturing and another for his residence. Pierre had a glass skylight installed in his \\"H√¥tel de l‚ÄôIndustrie du Papier a Cigarette\\" factory for illumination. It was used for manufacture from 1861 to 1879, and employed 80 workers in 1861. In 1865‚Äì66 a workshop was installed for lithography and printing. A second building was acquired at 13 St Sauveur, then additional buildings until an entire block was occupied, with the manufacturing process becoming increasingly automated, driven by steam power. By 1889 the Job company employed 290 women and 40 men. In the late 1890s, the company hired art nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha, as well as many other artists, to design advertising posters for the brand. JOB Posters - Sept Deniers Mucha drew a sinuous long-haired goddess holding a rolled cigarette. The image was inspired by Michelangelo's Sibyls from the Sistine Chapel.Renate Ulmer, Alfons Mucha, Taschen: 2002, pp. 38‚Äì40 The poster image was so popular that it was sold as a lithograph. In 2008, the company commissioned Stuckist artist, Paul Harvey to create a campaign series of posters with a stylistic reference to Alphonse Mucha.Fahy, Michael. \\"Zig Zag has a new paper round\\", Crain's Manchester Business, 16 June 2008. Retrieved 30 August 2010. Harvey made works featuring famous double acts to emphasise the sales message of \\"The Original Double\\", a reference to the twin-size packets of papers made by Job. Harvey's enthusiasm for the project came about because \\"Mucha is one of his heroes\\", said Mark Ross, the director of Glorious Creative agency managing the campaign. The work created some controversy:\\"Famous doubles\\", 3:AM Magazine, 19 October 2009. Retrieved 30 August 2010. Gilbert and George gave their endorsement to the images, but The Mighty Boosh and The White Stripes were not pleased to be featured. Famous Doubles, a show of the original paintings used for the posters, was promoted at the Wanted Gallery in Notting Hill by Fraser Kee Scott, director of the A Gallery.The Wanted Gallery has since been renamed GG Gallery The trademarks 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 and 2.0 are property of DRL Enterprises, Inc.

After completing his apprenticeship in Stowmarket, he studied at St. George's Hospital and at the Windmill Street School of Medicine in London. He then moved to Dublin and Paris, finally settling in Norwich in 1815. In 1823 he became assistant-surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and in 1826 surgeon. His reputation as a lithotomist, and in 1836 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Among his publications were Sketches of the Medical Schools of Paris, describing hospital practice there, and A History of the Variolous Epidemic which occurred in Norwich in the year 1819. Crosse worked on bladder stones. In 1833 he won the Jacksonian prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for The Formation, Constituents, and Extraction of the Urinary Calculus. Life Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, Norwich (line engraving by W. Wellcome) Crosse was born on 6 September 1790, at Boyton Hall, Great Finborough, Suffolk, the second son of William Cross, a farmer, and Ann (n√©e Green). At an early age he was apprenticed to Thomas Bayly, a surgeon- apothecary in Stowmarket. When his apprenticeship was finished he went to London, and studied at St. George's Hospital and at the Windmill Street School of Medicine. Benjamin Brodie then recommended him to James Macartney as a demonstrator at Trinity College, Dublin. Not receiving a diploma there, Crosse (who had added an 'e' to his surname in line with several of his paternal ancestors) left Dublin and went to Paris, where he spent the winter of 1814‚Äì15. In March 1815 he settled in Norwich. In 1823 Crosse became assistant- surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and in 1826 surgeon. He became known as a lithotomist, and had a large surgical practice. In 1836 Crosse was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He had a series of 40 apprentices, among them George Murray Humphry. In 1848 his health began to fail. He died on 9 June 1850, and was buried in the cloisters of Norwich Cathedral. Works Plate 3 from A treatise on the formation, constituents, and extraction of the urinary calculus Crosse wrote letters describing hospital practice of Paris to friends in London and Dublin, and on his return published them as a book Sketches of the Medical Schools of Paris. He was mainly interested in anatomy and surgery, and scarcely mentions physicians of Paris; he thought the London education better, except that there were good lectures on medical jurisprudence in Paris, and at that time none in London. In 1820 he published A History of the Variolous Epidemic which occurred in Norwich in the year 1819. It contains an account of the progress of vaccination in the eastern counties. Crosse worked with his colleague John Yelloly on bladder stones, and their results were published in Philosophical Transactions in 1829 and 1830. In 1833 he obtained the Jacksonian prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for a work on The Formation, Constituents, and Extraction of the Urinary Calculus, which was published in 1835, with illustrations by the Norwich artist Obadiah Short.Crosse, A treatise on the formation, constituents, and extraction of the urinary calculus, Plates I‚ÄìXXIV He also published several papers in the Transactions of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, of which he was president in 1846; and some cases of midwifery written by him were published after his death by Dr. Copeman, one of his pupils.

Population: Etymology The name \\"Mogocha\\" is derived from the river on which it stands, whose name comes from the Evenki word mongochi. This meaning of this word is ambiguous; it can be translated as golden valley, but also as belonging to the Mongo tribe. History It was founded in 1910, with the construction of the local section of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Rail traffic began in 1914. In addition to its status as a supply point for the railway, from the 1920s and 1930s it became the base for gold mining in the surrounding area. Town status was granted to it in 1950. From 1947 until 1953, Mogocha was site for the Klyuchevlag prison labor camp of the gulag system. The camp held up to 3,000 prisoners at any one time, mainly used as forced labor for molybdenum and gold mining in the villages to the southwest of the town. During the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations in the 1950s, a large airbase was created near Mogocha, which hosted several helicopter regiments until the 1990s. The remoteness of Mogocha combined with the harsh climatic conditions, gave rise to the Soviet military slang expression God created Sochi, and Satan Mogocha. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and subsequent economic crisis, Mogocha lost around one third of its population, a common occurrence for cities in the Russian Far East.

The story, often considered to be partially autobiographical, considers the rather bleak relationship between a man and his family. The story was begun in England as Lawson's first novel, but was broken off and eventually completed after his return to Australia. Plot summary A story by Henry Lawson, was written in 1902 and included in Triangles of Life (1913). The story records the return home to his farm on New Year's Eve of a poor carpenter, who discovers that his three children and the household chores have been neglected by his neurotic and slatternly wife; after cleaning up and attending to his family during the night, the workman returns to his trade next morning. The setting of the story (Pipeclay), the fact that the foreign father's name is Nils, and the tension between the parents, suggest that the story is autobiographical. The story begins on New Year's Eve, with a father pacing steadily and hopelessly through the smothering darkness. He arrives home to his cold and uninviting hut. The man's oldest son emerges from the darkness. He had been feeling sick, he says. But he is better now. He would like to help his father with the cooking and cleaning, but has neither the knowledge nor the means to do so. The man's wife, Emma, calls from her bedroom. She is currently \\"bad again in the head\\" and whines constantly about her husband's utter uselessness. Everything is his fault. The following morning, New Years Day, the man rises from his sleep and leaves for the farming town at which he works. But the new year brings neither hope nor relief- it is just the beginning of another bleak, unpromising cycle of life. \\"And the old year died as many old years had died.\\" Characters *Nils: ** The father. He works at his trade in a farming town about five miles away from his home, and is struggling to make a farm and a home between jobs. He is constantly unappreciated by his wife, and finds little pleasure in arriving home to his family. *Emma: ** The mother.

In his autobiography, Lawson quotes a friend's advice to him on a projected book about Bush people: \\"Treated ruthlessly, Rousseaulike, without regard to your own or others' feelings, what a notable book yours would be!\\"The Penguin Henry Lawson Short Stories (First published 1986) Edited with an introduction by John Barnes - Introduction It is often believed that this story was begun under the influence of such advice. The story itself is often read as a partial autobiography, perhaps recounting Lawson's obviously distressing childhood memories. Not unlike Lawson's famous early work, \\"The Drover's Wife,\\" 'A Child in the Dark, and a Foreign Father\\" deals with the relationship of parent and child, but the writing style has vastly changed in the years separating the writing of the two. The sketch appears to lack the evocative impressonistic descriptions which carry so much emotional force in his best work, and is written with an impersonality of tone that is quite uncharacteristic.

Early life and training  Van Raalte was born in Lambeth, London in 1881 to a Dutch father, Joel van Raalte, a cigar merchant, and an English mother, Frances Elizabeth nee Cable.Joel van Raalte married at Tunbridge, Kent in 1871 to Frances Elizabeth Cable: civil marriage registration no. 2a/817, Sept Quarter 1871, Tunbridge Registration District. In April 1881 census ‚ÄòHenry‚Äô, his parents and 6 siblings were living in Brixton Road, Lambeth: RG11 607/17, The National Archives. He was educated at the City of London School, the Royal Academy and later in Belgium and the Netherlands. In 1901 he was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, and in the same year had a picture hung at the Royal Academy exhibition. In 1902 there were full-page reproductions of an etching, and a dry-point by van Raalte in Modern Etching and Engraving, published by the Studio at London, highly competent and assured pieces of work, though he was then aged only 21.  Western Australia  In 1910 he went to Western Australia and founded a school of art at Perth. He did many etchings and aquatints, often taking gum trees for his subjects, but it was some time before his work became known in the eastern states. He had an exhibition of his work at Perth in 1919 which was followed by another at Adelaide. In 1921 he was appointed curator of the art department at Adelaide, and in 1922 his title was changed to curator of the Art Gallery of South Australia. He resigned in January 1926 after interference by Sir William Sowden, president of the Gallery's board, in the hanging of what Van Raalte considered \\"bad art\\". He established a studio at Second Valley, South Australia, and lived there for the last three years of his life.  Death  Except for occasional fits of depression van Raalte was apparently in good health, and it was intended that he should hold an exhibition of his work at Adelaide about the end of 1929. On 4 November of that year he was found in the grounds of his house shot through the head, and he died on the same day, leaving a widow and three sons.

He later became a leader in student politics, serving as President of the UCR student chapter Franja Morada at the Catholic University of Santiago del Estero and as President of the UCR's youth wing for two terms. He became a lawyer and continued his political activities. Zamora married twice; he has one son from his first marriage, and two sons and a daughter from his second. Elected to the Provincial Legislature in Santiago del Estero in 1991, he served in the post until 1993, and was elected Mayor of the city of Santiago del Estero in 1995. He became a provincial deputy once again in 1997 and served as President of the UCR caucus until 1999. In that year he was elected vice-mayor of Santiago del Estero and took over as Mayor in 2001 when the incumbent resigned. In 2003 he was elected Mayor of the city in his own right with 64% of the vote, serving until 2004. Zamora has been a key UCR supporter of Peronist Presidents N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner (a 'K' Radical, as UCR allies of Kirchnerism are known), and opposed leading UCR figures' plans to support an opposing candidate to the Kirchners in the 2007 presidential elections. He was elected governor in 2005 on the Civic Front for Santiago ticket, with the support of some Peronists and Socialists as well as most Radicals (UCR) in the province. From 2005 until 2007, Zamora's vice-governor was Emilio Rached; Rached was elected to the Argentine Senate in 2007, and later broke ranks with the governor. Zamora was re-elected governor in 2008 with 85% of the vote. Governor Zamora sought an amendment to the provincial constitution that would enable a third consecutive term; the amendment was defeated in an October 22, 2013, Argentine Supreme Court ruling, however. His alliance with Kirchnerists had by then led to his break with the UCR, which opted to endorse former Vice Governor Emilio Rached in a Progressive, Civic and Social Front ticket for the upcoming 2013 gubernatorial elections. Zamora nominated his wife, Claudia Ledesma, as the Civic Front for Santiago candidate for governor and she defeated Rached by a 65-to-15% margin; the outgoing governor was concurrently elected to the Argentine Senate. Supported by President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner in a bid to broaden her support among 'K' Radicals, Zamora was elected Provisional President of the Argentine Senate with the support of Kirchner's majority Front for Victory caucus; he took office on February 28, 2014.

The Type Archive (formerly the Type Museum) is a collection of artefacts representing the legacy of type founding in England, whose famous type foundries and composing systems supplied the world with type in over 300 languages. The Archive was founded in 1992 and is located in Stockwell, South London, England. Overview The Type Archive is the final repository of many of the original forms, punches, matrices and patterns of some of the most famous and successful metal and wood type foundries in the world. It also holds a historic collection of presses. It is estimated that the collections include between five and eleven million artefacts. The Archive is unique in holding examples of successive generations of technology used for type design and manufacture, from hand foundry and machine composition, through wood type, to photography and film setting (which laid the foundation for today's digital typography). In addition to holding its collections, the archive is a working factory that manufactures matrices (moulds for typecasting) for letterpress printing. The Museum has become a valuable educational resource for many colleges, and helps to meet the demand for an educational and experimental type workshop. According to the Museum's website:The Type Archive. =Collections= The Museum‚Äôs major collections include: * The Stephenson Blake Collection of English foundry type with industrial and hand casting equipment. In their long trading history Stephenson Blake & Company acquired many of the other famous-name English type foundries. The remaining material associated with these companies now resides at the Type Archive. * The Monotype Collection covers the entire history of Monotype Corporation‚Äôs global supply of fine letterpress machine composition in almost all languages and continues as a working company within the Archive.The complete archive and plant of the Monotype Corporation was purchased with a National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) grant in 1992. It belongs to the Science Museum, which delegates its care and operation to the Type Archive. The Science Museum is currently cataloguing the Monotype collection for the public benefit. * The Robert DeLittle wood type manufactory ‚Äî the last specialist English wood type manufacturer is a superb resource in this vital, engaging and under-researched area of type design. =Entities= The Type Archive involves the following entities: the Type Museum Trust, which is a Registered Charity 1009198 and a Registered Museum 1101 and its subsidiary The Type Museum Limited Registered Company 3677895 (trading as Monotype Hot-Metal). =Location= :100 Hackford Road :London SW9 0QU :England Access A small team of staff and volunteers work at the Type Archive on a regular basis. Some are directly involved in the manufacture and provision of Monotype matrices and spare parts, and are employed by Monotype Hot Metal Ltd. The company has never been without orders for matrices and machine parts since it began trading from the Stockwell site. Uniquely skilled volunteers also maintain and operate the historic presses and Monotype casting machinery. Access to the Type Archive collections in recent years has been hampered by a shortage of experienced and qualified volunteers who are familiar with the Archive's holdings, but this issue is currently being addressed and it is hoped that provision can be made for researchers to have limited access to the collections in the future. Much of the material held at Stockwell is unique and irreplaceable, so procedures must be in place to protect the holdings from theft or damage. Access will be provided only on days when a volunteer is available to locate material and supervise its use. A major exhibition showcasing the work of the late Berthold Wolpe, artist, designer, calligrapher and typographer opened in September 2017, and although scheduled to end in October it was extended until 4 December due to popular demand. Around 1000 visitors viewed the material on display. The Wolpe exhibition, arranged in conjunction with Monotype Imaging, which provided much of the funding for the event, is hoped to be the first of a series of regular opportunities for the public to access the wealth of unique, historic material held at Stockwell. An exhibition featuring the calligraphic work of Icelandic artist and handwriting expert, Gunnlaugur SE Briem, opened in June 2018, closing in mid-July that year. Further exhibitions and a regular series of Type Archive Talks (TAlks) are planned. The Covid-19 pandemic and the unrelated death of founder Susan Shaw (1932-2020) made access particularly difficult for staff, volunteers and researchers from March 2020. As of mid- July, the Type Archive is slowly returning to normal, with volunteers back on site on a regular basis.

Early life  After graduating from Austin High School as senior class president, Sparks received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas in 1961 where he was a member of the Texas Cowboys and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Texas School of Law two years later. He clerked for United States District Court Judge Homer Thornberry before turning to private practice.  Family  His great-grandfather and his grandfather were also named Sam Sparks; the former was sheriff of Bell County, Texas, and the latter succeeded him in 1897. This Sam Sparks became president of the Texas Sheriff's Association in 1903 and the Texas state treasurer in 1906. He was married to Arden Reed Sparks, until she died in 1990. He married his second wife, Melinda Echols, formerly of Fort Worth, in 1995.  Federal judicial service  Sparks was nominated by President George H. W. Bush on October 1, 1991, to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, to a new seat created by 104 Stat. 5089. He was confirmed by the Senate on November 21, 1991, and received his commission on November 25, 1991. He took senior status on December 31, 2017. Notable cases Sparks once began an order with a poem, and began another order with the following: \\"When the undersigned accepted the appointment from the President of the United States of the position now held, he was ready to face the daily practice of law in federal courts with presumably competent lawyers. No one warned the undersigned that in many instances his responsibility would be the same as a person who supervised kindergarten.\\" Among his more notable cases were the sentencing of former Texas Attorney General Dan Morales (for mail fraud and filing false tax returns) and the trial of Gary Paul Karr for federal wire fraud (in connection with the kidnapping and murders of atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and her son and granddaughter). Sparks also heard the Karl Rove & Co. v Thornburgh case in 1993. This case found its way into court following a dispute over payment of fundraising expenses by the failed Republican Senate campaign of Dick Thornburgh. Sparks ruled that Rove's company could recoup roughly $180,000 in bills from the Thornburgh campaign. In 1994 Sparks ruled in favor of Steve Jackson Games against the United States Secret Service. The latter had raided Jackson's offices and seized computers, searching for a sensitive file that one of Jackson's employees may have posted. The Electronic Frontier Foundation helped with the lawsuit, and Sparks ruled that the Secret Service had acted in a too heavy-handed manner. In 1998 Sparks issued stays of execution for Joseph Stanley Faulder and Danny Lee Barber, holding that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles failed to provide due process in considering their requests for clemency.\\"U.S. Judge Praised as Man of Principle,\\" Fort Worth Star Telegram, Dec. 20, 1998 at 1B He received the Trial Judge of the Year from the Texas Chapter of the Board of Trial Advocates in 2005. In 2010, he became the second honoree in the history of the American College of Trial Lawyers' Sandra Day O'Connor Award. The award \\"is to be given from time to time to a judge, either federal or state, who has demonstrated exemplary judicial independence in the performance of his or her duties, sometimes in difficult or even dangerous circumstances.\\" In 2006 he handled a case involving the Texas Republican Party's effort to get former Congressman Tom DeLay's name removed from the ballot in the 2006 Congressional Election. DeLay won the Republican primary election in March, but resigned from Congress in early April during a corruption scandal. However, since Texas law states that the name of a candidate who \\"withdraws\\" from a race after the primary must remain on the ballot, Texas Democrats filed a lawsuit to prevent Republicans from nominating another candidate. Republicans argued that DeLay did not \\"withdraw\\" from the race but instead made himself ineligible to be elected by changing his voter registration from Texas to Virginia, therefore allowing Republicans to name a replacement. On July 6, Judge Sparks ruled that DeLay's name must remain on the ballot. In 2007, Justice Sparks ruled in a landmark settlement that greatly improved conditions for immigrant children and their families who were being held in the T. Don Hutto Residential Center operated by the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) under contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Dozens of children were released from the facility in Taylor, Texas with their families as a result of the litigation. In response to the harsh treatment of young children in T. Don Hutto, Judge Sparks established \\"the government would have to establish clear rules for how to detain families safely and humanely. And although officials at Hutto might be making changes now, he noted, didn‚Äôt Lawrence have a feeling it was merely because the defendants knew, on account of the lawsuit, that 'the hammer was coming down?\\" He said that he was beginning to wonder who was in charge \\"out there, either C.C.A. or the government. It‚Äôs very troubling to me.\\" In 2009, Sparks heard Fisher v. University of Texas, a case challenging the admissions policy of the University of Texas at Austin. He upheld UT's policy under Grutter v. Bollinger. In 2012 the court commemorated his 20 years served on the federal bench and marked the occasion with a portrait painted by artist Michele Rushworth.

The asphalt runway has the physical dimensions and is aligned 14/32. Scheduled services are provided to Oslo by Wider√∏e. The main general aviation user is R√∏rosfly, a pilot school, and the aviation club R√∏ros Flyklubb. Plans for an airport started in 1954 and the same year a provisional runway was built. Scheduled services with Braathens SAFE commenced in 1957, when a runway was completed. Upgrades from de Havilland Heron to Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft caused Braathens to abandon the airport until 1963, when the current asphalt runway was opened. Braathens remained at R√∏ros until 2001, when Wider√∏e took over. Based on public service obligations, the routes have variously been operated by Wider√∏e, Danish Air Transport, Coast Air and Danu Oro Transportas. History The initiative to build an airport in R√∏ros was taken by a group of individuals in 1954, with Olav Bergersen as the most enthusiastic. They contacted Braathens SAFE and asked if they were interested in operating flights out of the town. The airline had recently gained the right to fly between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes, and was therefore asked if they would be interested in making a stop-over for some of their services in R√∏ros. Ludvig G. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Notodden.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 104 R√∏ros Flyklubb was founded on 7 October 1955. They followed up on Bergersen's initiative and made formal contacts with the Norwegian Aero Club and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA). The latter inspected the town on 16 November, concluding that the locality was suitable for an east‚Äìwest runway. Also the Royal Norwegian Air Force showed interest, primarily to use as an emergency airfield. The centerline of the runway was decided upon on 14 February 1956, after which a cost estimate was calculated at 455,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), excluding buildings, for a runway. The airport was incorporated as Bergstadens Flyplass A/L on 2 July 1956. Funding was secured through the sale of shares. Construction began the following day, even though sufficient funding had yet to be secured. The military provided five trucks, while the rest of the work was contracted. Two weeks later, on 17 July, the first landing took place with a Piper Super Cub. Sufficient work completed by August, allowing an air show to be carried out on 1 and 2 August to raise capital to continue construction. By mid-September a gravel runway was completed and approved by inspections of the CAA and Braathens. The second stage of construction saw the extension of the runway to . It also saw the construction of a terminal consisting of an expedition building measuring , with an upper story used as a control tower, measuring . It cost and lacked such amenities as water. Telephone lines were installed by Norway Telecom and Royal Dutch Shell built a fuel tank. The airport received its technical approval on 18 July 1957 and opened the following day.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 105 Services were provided daily by Braathens using their 15-passenger de Havilland Heron aircraft to both Trondheim and Oslo. Because Braathens was soon to retire its Herons, the runway was extended to the following year. By then the construction costs had risen to NOK 486,000. With the introduction of the 44-passenger Fokker F27 Friendship in 1958, the runway at R√∏ros became substandard. Braathens therefore terminated its routes to R√∏ros, as they also were forced to do in Notodden and Hamar. Two upgrades were needed. First the runway was extended to and then it received asphalt. This was not completed until 1963, when Braathens resumed its route.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 143 By 1967 the runway had been further extended to . A new combined terminal building and control tower was also built. An aerodrome flight information service and radio beacon became operational in 1972, allowing for instrument flight rules at the airport. The Friendships remained in use on the route until the 1977, when they were retired and replaced with the Boeing 737-200, with more than twice the capacity. This created an overcapacity on the route and Braathens and the local community started cooperating to increase demand through marketing R√∏ros as a cultural, heritage and conference destination. R√∏rosfly was established at R√∏ros Airport in 1985. It operated as a general aviation company, with particular focus on aviation schooling. A new terminal building was completed in 1987 and opened on 27 August. Braathens replaced its -200s with the newer Boeing 737-500 in the early 1990s.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 249 Throughout its history at the airport, Braathens SAFE never made any profits on the route. For this the aircraft were too large. Prior to 1994 the airlines received concessions to operate the various routes. This were granted based on that some routes were profitable while other would operate at a loss. From 1 April 1994 the airline market in Norway was deregulated, and Braathens was no longer obliged to operate to R√∏ros. The authorities announced that they would introduce a public service obligation (PSO) auction, financed through a fee which would be charged on all domestic routes. Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines System agreed to waiver the fee in exchange for still operating their unprofitable routes.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 334‚Äì335 R√∏ros Airport had a peak patronage in 1996, with more than 30,000 passengers. The airport was taken over by the CAA (later renamed Avinor) in 1998. Starting in 1998 Braathens experienced a period of harsh financial performance. To cut costs, the airline therefore on 2 January 2001 terminated all its unprofitable routes, including to R√∏ros. As a temporary solution, Danish Air Transport flew the route until 31 July, after bidding NOK 500,000 per month. A public tender was issued, and Wider√∏e won the contract to operate from 1 August. Ground handling at the airport was taken over by R√∏ros Flyservice. Patronage in the last year of Braathens operations was 27,000 passengers. By 2002 this had dropped to about 8,000. The main reasons were more inconvenient flight times, smaller capacity and higher prices, caused by the contractual obligations in the PSO agreement. In particular the number of course and conference passengers dropped to near null. Coast Air won the next contract and took over flights from 1 April 2006 using the ATR 42 aircraft. On The board of Coast Air filed for bankruptcy on 23 January 2008. The Ministry of Transport and Communications attempted to find a replacement for Coast Air, contacting six different airlines. Wider√∏e, Air Norway, and Danish Air Transport expressed interest to resume operations on the route to Oslo, with Wider√∏e being awarded a temporary contract and starting operations on 4 February 2008. Danu Oro Transportas began operating a permanent service from 1 April 2009 until Wider√∏e won back the contract for the route 1 December 2012. During winters of 2010 to 2012, Skyways operated two weekly round trips to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, using Fokker 50 aircraft, serving ski resorts in the Fun√§sdalen area. Facilities R√∏ros features an asphalt runway with physical dimensions . The runway safety area measures . The runway has a declared take-off run available of and a landing distance available of . The runway is aligned 14/32 and is equipped with instrument landing system category I. It is situated at an elevation of . There is a simple terminal building and tower. There is paid parking, a taxi stand and rental cars at the terminal. The airport is situated west of the town center; there is no public transit between the airport and the town. Airlines and destinations The only scheduled services out of R√∏ros are provided by Wider√∏e. These are public service obligation routes subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. From April 2020 Air Leap will take over the PSO-route to Oslo, and will operate the route with a Saab 340. R√∏rosfly is a general aviation company based at the airport, operating a fleet of five aircraft. Their primary activity is as a pilot school. The aviation club R√∏ros Flyklubb is also based at the airport. They own a Cessna 172SP. R√∏ros airport had 21,575 passengers in 2014. The airport served 2,768 aircraft movements and handled 2 kilograms of cargo. R√∏rosfly is responsible for about three-quarters of the aircraft movements.

An order to arrest K B Sahay was passed by Deputy Commissioner, Hazaribagh (Order No.: 132 of 10.08.1942) and the very next day he was sent off to jail. In jail, he was instrumental in the escape of Jayaprakash Narayan from jail along with his associates namely Rama Nandan Mishra, Yogendra Shukla, Suraj Narayan Singh, Sri Gulab Chand Gupta and Sri Shaligram Singh on 9 November 1942. As a consequence, he was sent off to Bhagalpur jail with orders for rigorous imprisonment.  Political life  Earlier, when provincial autonomy was granted by the British Raj, Sri K B Sahay was elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1936 and was made a parliamentary secretary in Sri Krishna Sinha's ministry in 1937. During this period, K. B. Sahay also developed sympathy for the poor peasants whose inhuman suffering at the hands of zamindars had a great bearing on his mind. At a meeting at Chhapra on 11 May 1942, presided over by Dr. Rajendra Prasad and at another such meeting at Kudra in Shahabad, he spoke at length on the subject. Chief Minister of Bihar Sri Babu and Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Anugrah Babu, also came from zamindar families. Sri Babu asked him to arrange a public meeting at his native place Tarapur in Munger. At this meeting, issues related to \\"Torture of inhabitants of Banaili Raj by their Zamindar\\" was taken up by Sri Babu and Krishna Ballabh Babu. This meeting which was also attended by Acharya J. B. Kriplani and was a grand success. After independence, when the interim government was formed in Bihar, K.B. Sahay was given the Revenue ministry since it was his pet subject. This gave him an opportunity to fulfill his cherished dream of relieving the peasants from the clutches of zamindars. K. B. Sahay was assisted suitably by Sri Bajrang Sahay in drafting \\"Abolition of Zamindari\\" Bill and the credit for its successful implementation goes to Sri Krishna Babu who faced the brunt of the zamindars in the Bihar Assembly and got it passed successfully. He is credited with having authored and passed the first pioneering legislation in the country to abolish the Zamindari system. In 1952, it was the first such legislation in the country. With the Bill becoming an Act (Bihar Act 30 of 1950), it sent shock waves among the zamindars all over Bihar and these zamindars under the leadership of Dr. Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga decided to challenge the Act as a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. During this period, Sri K. B. Sahay also survived a body blow intended to wipe him out. K.B. Sahay was almost alone in his crusade for land reforms in the formative 1950s and '60s. Bihar was the first to introduce legislation to abolish zamindari. But Patna High Court struck down the Act, as did the Supreme Court. It was this that led an exasperated Jawaharlal Nehru to push the first amendment to the Constitution. The Constitution of India was amended for the first time and Article 31 (A) and Article 31 (B) were added to nullify the effect of Article 14. The legislation on land ceilings was introduced in the Assembly in 1955. A watered-down version was passed only in 1959 and got presidential assent in 1962. K. B. Sahay contested the first assembly elections of 1952 from Giridih and won by a handsome margin to return as the revenue minister to the Government of Bihar in Sri Babu's cabinet. But in 1957, he was defeated in the assembly election from Giridih by Raja Kamakhya Narayan Singh of Padma (Hazaribag). However, K. B. Sahay won the assembly elections of 1962 to enter the Bihar Assembly for the third time. In 1957, during the leadership struggle between Dr. S K Sinha and Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha, he supported Anugrah Babu for becoming Chief Minister. However Sri Krishna Babu won and again became the CM with Anugrah Babu as his deputy.  Chief Minister of Bihar  In the years that followed, Kamraj, the veteran Congress leader came forward with his \\"Kamraj Plan\\" to strengthen the party. On 19 September 1963, with the announcement of \\"Kamraj Plan\\" came the news of Binodanand Jha being taken as one of the eight Chief Ministers to look after the affairs of Congress Party. Beer Chand Patel threw his hat in the contest for the Chief Minister of Bihar. Sahay who was deputy minister in Jha's cabinet was the other contestant. Satyendra Narayan Sinha, the prominent Education Minister, who was decidedly second-in-command in the Binodanand Jha Cabinet announced his support for Sahay. Patel was no match for Sahay, who polled double the number of votes as Patel. On 2 October 1963, the birth anniversary of Gandhi was celebrated in Bihar along with the swearing in ceremony of Sahay as the third Chief Minister of Bihar with Satyendra Narayan Sinha again becoming second in command. Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan had written a letter to Sri Babu 5 years before Krishna Ballabh Sahay became the Chief Minister in his favor but there was no mention of him being made the Chief Minister. Krishna Ballabh Sahay became the Chief Minister based on his merit and his proven track record of being an able Revenue Minister of the State since Independence till 1957. It is to be noted that later on Sri Krishna Babu never helped him succeed for the post of CM of Bihar as against what is spread by Aaj Tak in a television programme on Bihar Politics aired in 2015. Sahay lost the 1967 elections but won the local body elections in 1974 to enter the Bihar Legislative Council as an MLC. He faced enquiries by the Aiyyar Commission in between but was VINDICATED. Sahay met with a fatal road accident on 3 June 1974 just after winning the election, on his way back to his native place Hazaribag. Among the leaders of Bihar belonging to the 20th century, whom the people of this state would long remember for the constructive and invaluable services rendered towards the progress of Bihar, Sahay would certainly find a prominent place. His life is a superb example of how a man can attain his cherished dream by dogged determination, systematic planning and hard labour. His dream of an independent India and an ever progressing Bihar for which he sacrificed his whole life.

Both were commissioned during his tenure as Chief Minister of Bihar. The Heavy Engineering Corporation Ranchi where the current Jharkhand Government runs, was commissioned during his tenure. As the Chief Minister of Bihar, he gave full support for the establishment of Sainik School for Indian Armed Forces in Tilaiya. He was also instrumental in starting women's college in Hazaribag in 1963, which is named after him.

It was founded in 998 by Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor and contains relics of St. Bartholomew the Apostle.S. Prete, \\"Reliquie e culto di S. Bartolomeo ap. dal Medio Oriente a Roma all'Isola Tiberina\\", Studi e Ricerche sull'Oriente Cristiano, Rome 5.3 (1982:173-181) It is located on Tiber Island, on the site of the former temple of Aesculapius, which had cleansed the island of its former ill-repute among the Romans and established its reputation as a hospital, continued under Christian auspices today. Its Cardinal priest has been Cardinal Blase Cupich since 19 November 2016. Basilica di San Bartolomeo all'Isola, with the Torre dei Caetani behind  History  In Roman times, the Temple of Aesculapius stood on the site of the modern church. The entire Isola Tiberina had actually been covered in marble in an effort to make the island look like a ship. The prow can still be seen today. Emperor Otto built this church, which was initially dedicated to his friend Adalbert of Prague. It was renovated by Pope Paschal II in 1113 and again in 1180, after its rededication upon the arrival of the relics of the apostle Bartholomew. The relics were sent to Rome from Benevento, where they had arrived from Armenia in 809. The relics are located within an ancient Roman porphyry bathtub with lions' heads, under the main altar. The marble wellhead bears the figures of the Savior, Adalbert and Bartholomew and Otto III. The church was badly damaged by a flood in 1557 and was reconstructed, with its present Baroque fa√ßade, in 1624, to designs of Orazio Torriani. Further restorations were undertaken in 1852. The interior of the church preserves fourteen ancient Roman columns and two lion supports that date from the earliest reconstruction of the basilica. The inscriptions found in S. Bartolomeo, a valuable source illustrating the history of the Basilica, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume IV (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1874), pp. 527-540. In 2000, San Bartolomeo was dedicated by Pope John Paul II to the memory of the new martyrs of the 20th and 21st century.  Exterior  In the center of the piazzetta before the church is a four-sided guglia with saints in niches by the sculptor Ignazio Jacometti, erected here in 1869. The 12th-century tower near the church, the Torre dei Caetani, is all that remains of the medieval castello erected on the island by the Pierleoni. Interior San Bartolomeo houses the memorial to new martyrs of the 20th and 21st century, which was dedicated by Pope John Paul II in 2000. This memorial is taken care of by the Community of Sant'Egidio, who also painted the icon on the main altar. One of the relics that are kept as part of the memorial is the piece of rock that was used in 1984 to kill Blessed Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko.  List of Cardinal priests  San Bartolomeo all'Isola was established as a titulus (Titulus S. Bartholomaei in Insula) of a Cardinal Priest by Pope Leo X on 6 July 1517.David M.

He died as a result of a scuba diving accident at Rio de Janeiro. Military career Born in the small town of Dom Pedrito in Rio Grande do Sul on the border with Uruguay, Coutinho moved to Rio de Janeiro when he was four years old. Living in Rio, Coutinho joined the Military School, and would ultimately reach the rank of Captain of Artillery. On the other hand, he also showed great interest to the sports area, graduating from the School of Physical Education of the Army. In 1968, he was chosen to represent their school in a World Congress, held in the United States. There he met American professor Kenneth H. Cooper, founder of the Cooper test. Invited by Cooper, Coutinho attended the NASA Human Stress Laboratory. Sports career In 1970 Coutinho was appointed as physical fitness coach for the Brazilian team in preparation for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico; it was during this time that Coutinho introduced the Cooper method to the Brazilian team. After the competition, he would become supervisor for the Peru national football team, technical coordinator of Brazil's World Cup team in 1974, the French team Olympique de Marseille and the Brazilian Olympic Team, taking it to fourth place in the 1976 Summer Olympics. In the same year, he became head coach of Flamengo. Coutinho's relatively good performance in these roles, and his history with the Brazilian Confederation of Sports, gave him the credentials to be a substitute for Osvaldo Brand√£o within the Brazilian National Soccer Team, and he would eventually apply for the vacant head coach position in anticipation the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. His selection caused some surprise, as he was considered inexperienced for the job. Soon he took command, and tried to implement his own philosophy. The failure of the 1974 World Cup team, together with other factors, led many to conclude that the Brazilian method of play, based on individualism and star players, was outdated and that the important thing was now the European model, where players worked together like cogs in a machine. Coutinho attempted to implement a style modelled on the Total Football philosophy used by Rinus Michels' Dutch national side, who knocked Brazil out of the 1974 tournament with a 2‚Äì0 victory in the second group stage. Coutinho joined Los Angeles Aztecs as manager in 1981. Death  At the end of the 1981 season, Coutinho was on vacation in Rio de Janeiro, before leaving to take a position in Saudi Arabia. An expert diver, Coutinho was diving near the Ilhas Cagarras, an archipelago near Ipanema Beach, when he drowned at age 42.

The company, founded by Ian Schrager, is credited with inventing the Boutique Hotel concept in 1984 when it opened Morgans Hotel in New York. MHG owned or partially owned and managed thirteen hotels in London, Los Angeles, Miami, Las Vegas, New York and San Francisco comprising over 3,000 rooms. Among the hotel brands belonging to the Morgans Hotel Group were Delano, Mondrian, Hudson, Shore Club, Royalton, and A Morgans Original. Each of its hotels was designed by a world‚àírenowned designer, including: Andree Putnam, Philippe Starck, Marcel Wanders, Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz. In May 2016, SBE Entertainment Group agreed to acquire Morgans Hotel Group. The combined company would own or operate over 20 hotels, including properties under SBE's flagship SLS brand. The transaction was completed on November 30, 2016. Morgans Hotel Group had been a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ exchange until the SBE acquisition. Sam Nazarian, sbe‚Äôs Founder and Chief Executive Officer, retained majority ownership of sbe, and remained its Founder & CEO, leading all day-to-day operations. Ron Burkle rolled his existing equity stake in Morgans into an ownership stake in sbe. In addition, sbe received an investment from Cain Hoy Enterprises, a global real estate investment company headed by Todd Boehly and Jonathan Goldstein. Jonathan Goldstein and Ron Burkle joined Sam Nazarian on sbe‚Äôs board of directors.  History  The company is generally credited with inventing the Boutique Hotel in 1984 when it opened Morgans Hotel in New York. In the 1980s, Ian Schrager and his business partner Rubell turned their attention to hotels. Their first hotel, Morgans, opened in 1984 and was an instant hit, introducing the boutique lifestyle hotel to the world. Following the success of Morgans, they opened the well received and highly successful Royalton Hotel and Paramount Hotel, both of them designed by Philippe Starck. With these properties, Schrager introduced \\"lobby socializing\\" whereby the hotel lobby became a new kind of gathering place for hotel guests and New York City residents alike and \\"cheap chic,\\" where affordable luxury was offered in a stylish and sophisticated environment. Schrager is also credited with inventing the \\"Urban Resort\\" with his Delano Hotel in Miami and Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood, also designed by Starck. These were followed by the Hudson Hotel in New York, where he fully realized his concept \\"hotel as lifestyle\\" which he continued to refine, expanding to cities such as San Francisco with the Clift Hotel and London with St. Martins Lane Hotel and the Sanderson Hotel, all three designed by the prolific Philippe Starck. The Delano Las Vegas opened in 2014 as a rebranding of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, in partnership with MGM Resorts International. In 2012 it was announced that Morgans would be overhauling Sea Containers House in London to be launched as a Mondrian Hotel in 2014. The design of the hotel was awarded to the Tom Dixon (industrial designer) led Design Research Studio. The hotel, Mondrian London At Sea Containers, opened on 30 September 2014. In the spring and summer of 2013, Morgans became the bone of contention in a proxy war between OTK Associates, an investment vehicle for the Olshan and Taubman real estate interests, and Yucaipa, the investment alter ego of Ron Burkle. In 2014, Morgans Hotel Group opened its first hotel in Turkey on 18 November which is located in an historical building, Eski Balƒ±klƒ± Han. 10 Karak√∂y A Morgans Original is located in Karak√∂y, city‚Äôs cultural and historical center. The architectural work of the historical B√ºy√ºk Balƒ±klƒ± Han has been undertaken by award-winning architect Sinan Kafadar ‚Äì METEKS Group which used to be a hospital in 19th century.

De Natura Deorum 2.37 While Hoyle himself was an atheist, the argument has since become a mainstay of creationist and intelligent design criticisms of evolution. This argument is rejected by the vast majority of biologists. From the modern evolutionary standpoint, while the odds of the sudden construction of higher lifeforms are indeed improbably remote, evolution proceeds in many smaller stages, each driven by natural selection rather than by chance, over a long period of time. The transition as a whole is plausible, as each step improves survivability; the Boeing 747 was not designed in a single unlikely burst of creativity, and modern lifeforms were not constructed in one single unlikely event, as the junkyard tornado posits. Hoyle's statement According to Fred Hoyle's analysis, the probability of cellular life's arising from non-living matter (abiogenesis) was about one-in-1040,000. The Boeing 747 metaphor is reported in Nature, 294 (1981), p.10 He commented: This echoes his stance, reported elsewhere: Hoyle used this to argue in favor of panspermia, that the origin of life on Earth was from preexisting life in space. Details The junkyard tornado derives from arguments most popular in the 1920s, prior to the modern evolutionary synthesis, which are rejected by evolutionary biologists. A preliminary step is to establish that the phase space containing some biological entity (such as humans, working cells, or the eye) is enormous, something not contentious. The argument is then to infer from the huge size of the phase space that the probability that the entity could appear by chance is exceedingly low, ignoring the key process involved, natural selection. Sometimes, arguments invoking the junkyard tornado analogy also invoke Borel's Law, which claims that highly improbable events do not occur. The usual argument against Borel's \\"Law\\" is that if all possible outcomes of a natural process are highly improbable when taken individually, then a highly improbable outcome is certain. The true law being referenced is actually the Strong Law of large numbers, but creationists have taken a simple statement made by Borel in books written late in his life concerning probability theory and called this statement Borel's Law. This \\"Borel's Law\\" is actually the universal probability bound, which when applied to evolution is axiomatically incorrect. The universal probability bound assumes that the event one is trying to measure is completely random, and some use this argument to prove that evolution could not possibly occur, since its probability would be much less than that of the universal probability bound. This, however, is fallacious, given that evolution is not a completely random effect (genetic drift), but rather proceeds with the aid of natural selection. The junkyard tornado is also applied to cellular biochemistry. This is comparable to the older infinite monkey theorem but instead of the works of William Shakespeare, the claim is that the probability that a protein molecule could achieve a functional sequence of amino acids is too low to be realised by chance alone. The argument conflates the difference between the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and as such may evolve under natural selection to become better adapted and perhaps more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in Boeing 747). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction. According to Ian Musgrave in Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations: Reception The junkyard tornado argument is rejected by evolutionary biologists, since, as the late John Maynard Smith pointed out, \\"no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step.\\"John Maynard Smith, The Problems of Biology, p.49. (1986), , \\"What is wrong with it? Essentially, it is that no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step.\\" Evolutionary biology explains how complex cellular structures evolved by analysing the intermediate steps required for precellular life. It is these intermediate steps that are omitted in creationist arguments, which is the cause of their overestimating of the improbability of the entire process. Hoyle's argument is a mainstay of creationist, intelligent design, orthogenetic and other criticisms of evolution. It has been labeled a fallacy by Richard Dawkins in his two books The Blind Watchmaker and Climbing Mount Improbable. Dawkins argues that the existence of God, who under theistic uses of Hoyle's argument is implicitly responsible for the origin of life, defies probability far more than does the spontaneous origin of life even given Hoyle's assumptions, with Dawkins detailing his counter-argument in The God Delusion, describing God as the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit.

A specialist status state school, Kings Manor closed and reopened as an Academy named Shoreham Academy, with funding from the central government, in September 2009. Kings Manor School was formed in 1970 by the merger of King's Manor Girls school in Kingston Lane which had opened in 1959, with Shoreham and Southwick Senior Boys County school in Middle Road which had opened in 1937.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18236 Initially, the school operated on both sites, but later all facilities were transferred to the Kingston Lane site. The school took students from year seven through year eleven and had an adjoined sixth form college, the student population of which was derived primarily from the main school. The wide catchment area of the school resulted in pupils being taken from diverse social-economic backgrounds. For ease of administration, each year group was divided into ten bands, assigned the letter K or M and a number from 1-5 (e.g. 9K5 or 10M3). However, beyond this, there was little resemblance to a traditional house system. With regards to uniforms, year seven, eight, and nine pupils wore dark blue shirts while those in years ten and eleven wore pale blue. Local newspaper The Argus commented upon the irony of the school's first pupil to go onto the University of Oxford in the same year that Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families Ed Balls threatened the school with closure. This was, however, incorrect, as the school had a track record of Oxbridge entrants during the 1970s and 1980s, including the government economist Paul Johnson who went on from the school to Oxford in 1985. The Education Secretary noted King's Manor as one of 11 schools in the Sussex area which qualified as \\"failing schools\\" because less than 30% of students manage to achieve A-C grades at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). In 2007, 23% of pupils attained five or more GCSEs at Grade C or above including English and Maths, which was roughly half the national average of 46.7%; only 11% of pupils got an A*-C pass in GCSE Science.King's Manor Community College, BBC News Education League Tables.

An influential textbook of entomology that he first wrote went into several editions during his life and was updated posthumously with Imms' General Textbook of Entomology last being published in 1977 as a 10th edition. Early life Augustus was the elder of two children, his sister dying before him. His father, Walter Imms, worked at Lloyds Bank. His mother, Mary Jane Daniel, was born at Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A., of English parents who returned to England a few years later. He was among the few in his family who took to science. He suffered from asthma and his private schooling was interrupted frequently. He spent some time at St Edmunds High School, Birmingham, where the headmaster, William Bywater Grove, was a well- known mycologist. His interest in natural history was however encouraged most by C. F. Olney of the Northampton Natural History Society. He bought Robert Bentley Todd's Cyclop√¶dia of Anatomy and Physiology when he was about seventeen years old, and this had George Newport's detailed article on the 'Insecta'. (128 pages) Later life Imms studied science at Mason University College, Birmingham, and although his father wished him to become an industrial chemist, he took to biology. He studied under T. W. Bridge, then Professor of Zoology, and produced two scientific papers on fishes (1904, 1905). His contemporaries included B. Fantham, T. Goodey and R. H. Whitehouse. He graduated B.Sc. London with a second-class honours in zoology in 1903. After spending two years under Bridge at Birmingham, the award of an 1851 Exhibition Science Scholarship in 1905 helped him go to Cambridge, where he joined Christ's College under A. E. Shipley. He received his MSc in 1906 from the University of Birmingham. He worked as a student demonstrator and assistant demonstrator in zoology at Birmingham.National Archives of India 1907 File:PR_000003045906 Imms candidature for Professor of biology at Muir College In 1911, Imms received an offer from the Government of India to become Forest Entomologist at Dehra Dun to succeed E. P. Stebbing. He studied lac cultivation in the Central Provinces and the pests of coniferous forests. He considered the six years in India as a better option that staying on in Cambridge and acquiring a ‚Äòmyopic impression that Cambridge is the centre of the universe‚Äô. In 1913 he left India for health reasons and accepted a post of reader in Agricultural Entomology under Professor S. J. Hickson at Manchester. In the years 1914 to 1918, Imms was rejected by various recruiting boards. He wrote to Rothamsted Experimental Station, urging the authorities to set up an entomology department and in 1918 it was established with him as chief entomologist. The first edition of his A General Textbook of Entomology appeared in 1925, published by Methuen. Its seventh edition appeared in 1948, the year before his death. By then it had become the premier entomological textbook of its day, rivalled at that time only by the much earlier (1888) American An Introduction to Entomology by John Henry Comstock. After Imms' death, three more editions were produced by Owain Richards and Richard Gareth Davies, their final, tenth edition appearing in 1977.

It premiered on HBO in July 2000.Cinetel Films: Corporate Profile - Other high profile television premieres include: Linked May 30, 2014 Plot New Secret Service agent Mike Connelly, assigned to protect President-elect Jack Cahill, becomes uneasy having to protect a person who is having an affair with a friend's wife. Connelly feels even worse about it after preventing an assassination attempt aboard Cahill's plane where a flight attendant is accidentally killed in the process. Sensing Connelly's discomfort around Cahill, his boss reassigns him to the team that protects the \\"nuclear football\\" as soon as Cahill becomes president. In the film, the \\"nuclear football\\" briefcase contains a high-tech laptop computer, which can only be operated through a two key system (one key operated by the president and the other by the agent on \\"football duty\\") along with thumbprint and eye retina scans from the President. In real life, the football still uses paper playbooks and an officer of the military guards/carries the football. After the newly inaugurated president has been planning a meeting with Fung, the President of Taiwan, to discuss the strained relationship between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, one of the Secret Service agents returns home to find that his family is being held hostage by some men who are later revealed to be Fung's henchmen. They force him to participate in a plot to steal \\"the football\\". When Presidents Cahill and Fung are in Taiwan aboard Fung's ship, the latter insists that he feels that peaceful co-existence with mainland China may no longer be possible and that drastic action must be taken to ensure China does not invade Taiwan. Soon afterwards, Fung's henchmen begin killing all the other agents, leaving Mike Connelly as the only loyal Secret Service agent left. Fung's men, along with Fung's girlfriend Iris, are successful in stealing the football, and Fung forces Cahill to activate it (by knocking him unconscious to get his thumbprint and eye retina scans), explaining that he will use the US's ICBMs to launch a nuclear strike on China. He hopes that this will lead a revolution among his people towards \\"a new beginning\\" of Taiwanese freedom, pointing out that since he alone controls all of the US's missiles, he would not have to worry about a mutually assured destruction of both China and the United States. Only the United States should worry when China retaliates. Meanwhile, Vice President Valdez is informed of the situation and Fung makes a phone call to her explaining that he has seized control of the United States' nuclear missiles and will launch one against Beijing unless both China and the United States within 24 hours recognize Taiwan's independence and that the United States promises to use its full military might against China if it tries to invade Taiwan. Valdez insists that this would never be possible and later Fung follows through with his threat, launching a first strike against Beijing using an ICBM from Nebraska. Valdez first contacts the President of Russia to assure that the missile is not targeted towards Russia. Then Valdez contacts Chairman Tzu of China to explain the situation and that the United States did not launch the missile and is therefore not responsible. She also offers to give Tzu the chance to shoot the missile out of the sky but Tzu angrily points out that this would be impossible. It is then that he gives the order to launch a retaliatory strike against the United States using one of China's ICBMs, which he calls \\"an eye for an eye\\". True to his word, the missile is targeted for Washington, D.C. After Beijing and later Washington are destroyed, Tzu launches a second strike using several of China's missiles as further retaliation for the destruction of China's capital. Meanwhile, Iris is revealed to Agent Connelly to be an undercover Chinese agent whose assignment was to recover the football and return it to Beijing. But even she had no idea Fung would actually launch missiles against her country, and points out that China would no doubt retaliate against the US in response to the attack, thus she points out now they both have a common interest. Together they are able to escape Fung's ship and follow Fung and the still kidnapped President to Hong Kong. They are both ultimately successful in taking out all but one of Fung's henchmen, all of which are rogue elements of the People's Liberation Army. The last remaining one strangles Iris to death however and continues his search for Agent Connelly. Meanwhile, Connelly finds President Cahill held at gunpoint by Fung who still has the football. Fung along with Agent Thornton orders Connelly to surrender or else either Fung or Thornton will kill the President. It is then Cahill says for Connelly to \\"remember your duty\\". Fung at first thinks he means the duty of protecting the President, but then Connelly points out that he is on football duty and that it's \\"some other guy's job\\" to protect the President. Connelly shoots the President in the leg which shocks Fung and distracts him just long enough to allow Connelly to take him and Agent Thornton out. Connelly and President Cahill now are in control of the football and begin the process of deactivating it. The last of Fung's henchmen however, is able to fatally wound the President before Connelly can take him out. But not before President Cahill is successfully able to deactivate the football. By doing so, Vice President Valdez and NORAD have regained control of the United States' nuclear arsenal. Valdez gives this news to Chairman Tzu and says that he may now order the destruction of his missiles. Tzu refuses, thinking Valdez is bluffing. Valdez then gives the order to NORAD that \\"Stage One is a go\\", which Tzu is horrified to find out is in fact a launch of several of the US's ICBMs. Valdez warns Tzu has one minute to destroy his missiles, and if he does, Valdez will destroy her missiles and points out to Tzu that he does not want to know what \\"Stage Two\\" is. Just when it seems all hope is lost however, Tzu complies with Valdez's instructions and destroys all his missiles which soon afterwards Valdez does the same with hers. Thus a major nuclear war was narrowly averted. At the end of the film, it has been implied that Valdez was elevated to the presidency, giving a speech to the American people about the challenges that go with her new responsibilities. She reminds them not to lose hope.

It forms a diptych with Sonnet 16, as Sonnet 16 starts with \\"But...\\", and is thus fully part of the procreation sonnets, even though it does not contain an encouragement to procreate. The sonnet is within the Fair Youth sequence. Summary Also known as \\"When I consider every thing that grows,\\" Sonnet 15 is one of English playwright and poet William Shakespeare's acclaimed 154 sonnets. It is a contained within the Fair Youth sequence, considered traditionally to be from sonnet 1-126 \\"which recount[s] the speaker's idealized, sometimes painful love for a femininely beautiful, well-born male youth\\".Cohen, Walter. \\"The Sonnets and 'A Lover's Complaint.'\\" The Norton Shakespeare, Volume 1: Early Plays and Poems. 3rd ed. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt. New York: W. W. Norton and Company. Print. p 1745. In another subcategory the sonnet is also contained within what is known as the Procreation sonnets. According to Vendler, the sonnet is the first to employ Shakespeare's grand microcosmic scale, more suited to philosophy than a sonnet about love.Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1997. Print. p 108. Shakespeare begins the poem by with the speaker \\"look[ing] on life from the vantage point of the stars above in his consideration; yet he sees as well from a helpless human perspective below.\\"(Vendler 108) The poem then introduces a \\"retrospective reading of ingraft\\"Vendler 110 that denotes immortalizing the Fair Youth that continues in Sonnet 16. Context Sonnet 15 is part of the Fair Youth sequence, or sonnets 1‚Äì126, as established by the 1609 Quarto, which was \\"divided into two parts, the first concerning a beautiful male youth and the second a woman.\\"(Cohen 1748) This sequence emphasizes \\"longing, jealousy, and a fear of separation, while anticipating both the desire and the anguish of the subsequent poems.\\"(Cohen 1748) Professor Michael Schoenfeldt of the University of Michigan characterizes the Fair Youth sequence sonnets as \\"the articulation of a fervent same-sex love,\\" but the character of this love remains unclear.Schoenfeldt, Michael Carl. A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2010. Print. p 1. Some commentators, noting the romantic language used in the Fair Youth sequence, call these poems a \\"daring representation of homoerotic...passions,\\"(Cohen 1745) of \\"passionate, erotic love,\\"(Cohen 1749) suggesting that the relationship between the addressee and the Fair Youth is sexual. Others suggest the relationship is one of purely platonic love. At the beginning of the Fair Youth sequence are the procreation sonnets, sonnets 1-17.Sullivan, Garrett A. \\"Voicing the Young Man.\\" A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Michael Schoenfeldt. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2010. Print. p 333. It is an \\"entire sonnet sequence...marked not only by a preoccupation with the category of memory, but also by a fascination with the sheer capaciousness and complexity of that category.\\"(Sullivan 333) Sonnet 15 is located at the latter end of this section. Sonnet 15 introduces the idea of the speaker \\"immortaliz[ing] his beloved in verse\\" (rather than by physical procreation, as in previous sonnets), a theme that continues in sonnets 16 and 17.Scott, Alison V. \\"Hoarding the Treasure and Squandering the Truth: Giving and Possessing in Shakespeare's Sonnets to the Young Man.\\" Studies in Philology, 101.3 (Summer 2004): 321. Structure Sonnet 15 is typical of an English (or \\"Shakespearean\\") sonnet. Shakespeare's sonnets \\"almost always consist of fourteen rhyming iambic-pentameter lines\\",(Cohen 1745) arranged in three quatrains followed by a couplet, with the rhyme scheme abab cdcd efef gg.(Cohen 1746) Sonnet 15 also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain. The first line of the couplet exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And all in war with Time for love of you, (15.13) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The meter of line four has generated some controversy. Stephen Booth has asserted that it \\"asks to be pronounced as a twelve-syllable, six-stress line\\", and Kenneth Larsen seems to concur, noting ambivalently that \\"[t]he line of 12 syllables (like the 12 astrological signs) is either deliberate or an unusual mistake.\\" Peter Groves has strongly criticized this view, writing: \\"Booth ... asserts that comment ... (rhyming with moment) should be stressed comm√©nt (unattested elsewhere in Shakespeare), turning a pentameter into the only alexandrine in the Sonnets, merely because he thinks that the line 'sounds good when pronounced that way'. John Kerrigan states flatly \\"[t]he line is not Alexandrine; influence has two syllables; and comment is accented on the first syllable, producing a feminine ending.\\" A resulting scansion is: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) Whereon the stars in secret influence comment; (15.4) :(√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Exegesis Sonnet 15 serves as part of the transition between the earlier Procreation Sonnets, in which the speaker urges the addressee to have children and thus \\"copy\\" himself to achieve immortality, and later sonnets in which the speaker emphasizes the power of his own 'eternal lines\\" (18.12) to immortalize the addressee. Stephen Booth, professor emeritus at the University of California Berkeley, notes that the \\"dividing line between the procreation sonnets and sonnets 18-126\\" has a curious \\"imperceptibility,\\"Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1977. Print. p 162. but he goes on to assert that Sonnet 15's closing line \\"As he [i.e. Time] takes from you, I engraft you new\\" (15.14) is the \\"first of several traditional claims for the immortalizing power of verse.\\"(Booth 158) This theme of poetic immortality is continued in later sonnets, including sonnet 17's closing couplet \\"You should live twice: in [your child] and in my rhyme,\\" in sonnet 18's last few lines \\"Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade / When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st. / So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee,\\" and sonnet 19's final line \\"My love shall in my verse live ever young.\\" Josephy Pequigney, Professor Emeritus of English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and author of Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare's Sonnets, argues that this new method of immortality provides the speaker with \\"an alternative means of salvaging the beloved, a means solely at his command and independent of the biological means that would require the youth to beget children on one of those eager maidens.\\"Pequigney, Joseph. \\"Joseph Pequigney on the Poet's Relationship with Time.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets and Poems.

He adds that this may indicate \\"an intensification of the protagonist's love and, as it is born of and nourished by beauty, its amorous character.\\"(Pequigney) Sonnet 15 also establishes the idea of a \\"war with time for love of you\\" (15.13), which is continued in earnest in sonnet 19 when the speaker \\"challenges...the universal devourer,\\" i.e. Time, \\"in an effort to keep his friend,\\" i.e. the addressee, \\"intact.\\"(Pequigney) According to Crosman, \\"W. H Auden , in his preface cites sonnet 15 as proof that the sonnets are not in chronological order.\\"Crosman, Robert. \\"Making Love out of Nothing at All: The Issue of Story in Shakespeare's Procreation Sonnets.\\" Shakespeare Quarterly Winter 41.4 (1990): 447-48. Print. p 484. However, he goes on to state that \\"Sonnet 12 through 15 stages little dramas in which the poet worries about the impact on himself of the young man's dying without making a copy of himself; the last of these 15 develops a strategy for dealing with this worry‚Äîthe poet will make copies of his beloved in verse.\\"(Crosman 484) This idea is further propelled by Schoenfeldt who claims that \\"The poet pledges to \\"engraft [the young man] new\\" (ll. 13‚Äì14) in his verse. While brave states are commonly worn \\"out of memory\\", the poet \\"war[s] with time\\" in order to perpetuate the memory of the young man (ll. 8, 13). In other words the poet emerges and an alternative memory technology to that of reproduction.(Schoenfeldt 338) Still, the speaker acknowledges that even this new solution is imperfect: Alison V. Scott explains that the \\"poet-speaker repeatedly addresses the problem that art cannot render a perfect 'copy' of the young man, and this observation impinges upon his promise to immortalize his beloved in verse.\\"(Scott 321) Interpretations *Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for the 2002 compilation album, When Love Speaks (EMI Classics) Notes References *Baldwin, T.

The program convened several working groups, administered grant projects, and disseminated information about digital preservation issues. The U.S. Congress established the program in 2000, and official activity specific to NDIIPP itself wound down between 2016 and 2018. The Library was chosen because of its role as one of the leading providers of high-quality content on the Internet. The Library of Congress has formed a national network of partners dedicated to preserving specific types of digital content that is at risk of loss. In July 2010, the Library launched a National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) to extend the work of NDIIPP to more institutions. The organization, which has been hosted by the Digital Library Federation since January 2016, focuses on several goals. It develops improved preservation standards and practices; works with experts to identify categories of digital information that are most worthy of preservation; and takes steps to incorporate content into a national collection. It provides national leadership for digital preservation education and training. NDSA also provides communication and outreach for all aspects of digital preservation. The NDSA membership includes universities, professional associations, commercial businesses, consortia, and government agencies. Overview The preservation of digital content has become a major challenge for libraries and archives whose mission is to preserve the intellectual and cultural heritage of the nation. In 1998 the Library of Congress began to develop a digital strategy with a group of senior managers who were charged with assessing the roles and responsibilities of the Library in the digital age. This oversight group was headed by the Associate Librarian for Strategic Initiatives, the Associate Librarian for Library Services, and the Register of Copyrights. This group held several planning meetings to assess the current state of digital archiving and preservation. The Librarian of Congress James H. Billington commissioned the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the Library's readiness to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving digital world. They recommended that the Library, working with other federal and non- federal institutions, take the lead in a national, cooperative effort to archive and preserve digital information. In December 2000, Congress appropriated up to $100 million ($75 million of which was slated for dollar for dollar cost matching) for the effort. Congress rescinded $47 million in unspent funds in 2007. In 2009, NDIIPP received about $6.5 million as a line item in the Library's annual budget appropriation. Congressional legislation The U.S. Congress has asked the Library of Congress to lead a collaborative project, called the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. In December 2000, Congress passed special legislation (Public Law 106-554) in recognition of the importance of preserving digital content for future generations, appropriating $100 million to the Library of Congress to lead this effort. (A government-wide rescission of .22 percent in late December 2000 reduced this special appropriation to $99.8 million.) This effort falls within the Library Services mission, which includes providing access to and preserving information for the benefit of the United States and the World. This mission extends to materials in electronic formats as well. In addition, the Library is the home of the U.S. Copyright Office and is thus already engaged in issues relating to copyright in a digital environment. Participating organizations The National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program is a cooperative effort. The Library is working closely with partners to assess considerations for shared responsibilities. Federal legislation calls for the Library to work jointly with the Secretary of Commerce, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Archives and Records Administration. The legislation also directs the Library to seek the participation of \\"other federal, research and private libraries and institutions with expertise in the collection and maintenance of archives of digital materials,\\" including the National Library of Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, the Research Libraries Group, the Online Computer Library Center and the Council on Library and Information Resources. The Library is also working with the non-federal sector. The overall strategy is being executed in cooperation with the library, creative, publishing, technology and copyright communities. In early 2001 the Library established a National Digital Strategy Advisory Board to help guide it through the planning process. This board is made up of experts from the technology, publishing, Internet, library and intellectual-property communities as well as government. The Library has also established a working group to look at ways that current copyright law can address how libraries and archives handle digital materials when preserving them and making them available to users. National significance The availability of electronic information is today taken for granted. With the rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, millions of people have grown accustomed to using these tools as resources to acquire information‚Äîfrom a Ph.D. candidate conducting research for a dissertation to a teacher who might not be able to take a class on a field trip to see historical artifacts to a lifelong learner. Digital has become the principal medium to create, distribute and store content, from text to motion pictures to recorded sound. Digital content now embodies much of the nation's intellectual, social and cultural history. Because digital materials can be so easily altered, corrupted or even lost, these materials must be saved now if they are to remain available to today's and tomorrow's generations. NDIIPP provided a national focus on important policy, standards and technical components necessary to preserve digital content. Investments in modeling and testing various options and technical solutions took place over several years, resulting in recommendations to the U.S. Congress about the most viable and sustainable options for long-term preservation, copyright law in the context of digital preservation, and other issues. In 2008, NDIIPP was the United States author for a four-nation recommendation (United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) to establish laws to support digital preservation, particularly for materials at risk of being lost. That report summarized the state of digital preservation in each country at the time, and highlighted relevant existing law for each country. NDIIPP kickstarted the Library's efforts to advice individuals on personal digital archiving. This resulted in an e-book on the topic, and the seeds of the current Library of Congress website on Personal Digital Archiving. NDIIPP managed the Congressional appropriation to kick-start many important digital preservation endeavors, some in the Digital preservation partnership projects section. Two others of note were issues that had some prior development, but were realized fully with the assistance of NDIIPP funding. The first technology was LOCKSS, a tool for digital preservation of scholarly articles and other digital formats. The second was a pilot project for archiving digital content from the WNET Public Broadcasting station, the Preserving Digital Public Television Project. That project evolved into today's American Archive of Public Broadcasting. Digital preservation partnership projects Digital Preservation Icon Included in the 300 partners (as of March 2013) are eight consortial partnerships comprising 33 institutions that are selecting, collecting and preserving specific types of digital content: * Data-PASS * Dot Com Archive *ECHO DEPository * International Internet Preservation Consortium * MetaArchive Cooperative * National Geospatial Digital Archive * North Carolina Geospatial Data Archiving Project * Web at Risk Collections  In keeping with the mission of the NDIIPP, they are working with over 1,400 collections globally to preserve institution's at risk digital content. The collection's content ranges from Arts and Culture, Religion and Philosophy, Social Sciences, and World History and Cultures. The Library of Congress provides a full list of the collections as well as a interactive map of the collections' geographical location.

The Slovak Zion Synod (1919) joined the ULCA in 1920. The Icelandic Synod (1885) also joined the United Lutheran Church in America in 1942. Prior to the formation of the ULCA, the original three synods had formed various committees between 1877 and 1902 to coordinate activities. One of these was a joint committee to prepare a \\"Common Service for all English-speaking Lutherans\\". As a result of that committee's work, the Common Service of 1887 was adopted by all three synods, and the Common Service Book of the Lutheran Church was jointly published by the publishing houses of the three synods in 1917. The ULCA took over publication of the Common Service Book upon its formation in 1918. In 1962, after a five-year merger process, the United Lutheran Church in America became part of the new Lutheran Church in America (LCA). Twenty-six years later, on January 1, 1988, the LCA joined with the American Lutheran Church (1960) and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, (1978) to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which is today the largest Lutheran church body in the United States.Histories of bodies that merged to form the ULCA (Evangelical Church in America) In 1961, just before its merger into the LCA, the ULCA had 4,893 pastors, 4,363 congregations, and 2,390,075 members.

Both platforms have their original BMT style mosaic trim line and name tablets that are predominantly earth tones of brown, tan, orange with white accents. There are \\"M\\" tablets for \\"Morgan\\" on the trim line at regular intervals and name tablets that have \\"MORGAN AVE\\" in Times New Roman font. There are also directional mosaic signs in the same style as the name tablets. Both platforms have large square columns tiled in white since they are below buildings and not the sidewalk. All of them have name plates reading \\"MORGAN AVE\\" in black sans serif lettering on a white mosaic background. The mosaic name plates on the columns are unusual to the subway system, since most of the system's station-pillar name plates are merely plaques. =Exits= This station has two entrances/exits. * The staffed entrance is at the extreme east (railroad south) end. A long ramp from each platform leads to a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions.

This full-time entrance has a station agent booth. One of the stairs features an original BMT design while the other two were renovated later. The entrances serve a mostly industrial area, so they are not heavily used; the one to the northeastern corner was closed in the early 2010s.https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/Subway- Exits-MTA-Closed-Locked-Train-Stairs- Blocked-364549731.htmlhttp://indsecondsystem.weebly.com/morgan-ave.html * The station's other entrance/exit is an unstaffed brick station house on ground level on the west side of Bogart Street on the T-intersection of Harrison Place.

Figs of that tree are a main food source. The nesting season ranges from April to September, during which azure-rumped tanagers move in pairs or family groups. Cooperative breeding has been reported. Outside the breeding season, larger flocks of up to 18 birds have been reported. The azure-rumped tanager is endangered because of deforestation to clear the way for coffee plantations. In Guatemala, only 21% or of the potential area of distribution are still covered with broadleaf forest, the tanager's prime habitat. 80000 ha or 68% of the potential area of distribution is covered with coffee plantations. It is estimated that there are 8250‚Äì23250 birds left in Guatemala. For Chiapas, there is no recent estimate, but in the 1980s there were 112000 ha of suitable habitat, which is expected to be much smaller now due to a growing human population and increased pressure by agricultural activities Its closest relative appears to be the similarly-patterned grey- and-gold tanager.

It was made by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo (creators of It Happened Here) and based on the 1961 David Caute novel Comrade Jacob. Plot The film details the story of the 17th-century social reformer and writer Gerrard Winstanley, who, along with a small band of followers known as the Diggers, tried to establish a self-sufficient farming community on common land at St George's Hill (\\"Diggers' Hill\\") near Cobham, Surrey. The community was one of the world's first small-scale experiments in socialism or communism, and its ideas were copied elsewhere in England during the time of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, but it was quickly suppressed, and in the end left only a legacy of ideas to inspire later generations of socialist theorists.

There are various explanations as to the origins of the name:Pilleth Radnor Forest Valleys Association *Pwll-y-Llethr ‚Äì translated from Welsh to The Pit on the Slope, which could refer to the healing well of the church of St. Mary *Pill Lledd ‚Äì translated to The Wide Refuge which could refer to a tunnel from the monastery at Monaughty to the well Well and the church St Mary's Church, Pilleth It is thought by historians that Pilleth has been a place of worship since the foundations of the early Celtic Christian church. People would make pilgrimages to the holy well, reputed to have healing properties for the eyes in particular. The church was much frequented in the Middle Ages, with the current structure dating mainly from the 13th century, the tower from the 14th century, and its single bell from circa 1450. The church was greatly damaged during the 1402 battle, and a fire in 1894 destroyed much of the ancient woodwork, with surviving items transferred to other local churches. As a result of new cottages being built, the village began to grow again in late Victorian times to a population of over 100.Population figures for Pilleth parish Victorian Powys In 1909 Edward Whitehead, a London lawyer resident in Nant-y-Groes, engaged Sir Walter Tapper who installed a temporary roof and the stone steps on the southern side.

A major programme of restoration was undertaken in 2002-2004, partly funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and with support from the European Regional Development Fund.

The rope dress is not of itself a form of restraint, but is used either by itself as an adornment, or incorporated into restraining bondage.

In 2006, Jennings was the Democratic nominee for the United States Congress to represent Florida's 13th congressional district. The seat was left open when incumbent Katherine Harris ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2006 election, 237,861 votes were cast, but for unknown reasons, 18,382 of the electronic ballots in Sarasota County recorded no vote for a congressional candidate. By the tally of the remaining votes, Jennings received 373 fewer votes than her opponent, Republican Vern Buchanan. Of the counted votes in Sarasota County, Jennings won 52.8%. If the missing votes had broken for Jennings by the same percentage as the counted votes in Sarasota County, the Democrat would have won the race by about 600 votes instead of losing by 368, according to a review by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.*Mahlburg, Bob Dist. 13 voting analysis shows broad problem Sarasota Herald-Tribune, November 9, 2006 An audit of the machines found nothing wrong, and it is believed that some voters failed to vote for the congressional candidate because it was on the same page as the crowded governor's race. Other voters who failed to vote in the congressional race initially were able to catch the mistake on the review page of the ballot. Still others, who had voted, noticed their votes had not been recorded when they reviewed the votes at the end. There has been no explanation as to why some votes did not record after they were made.

She also served as president of the Sarasota Downtown Association and president of the Sarasota Film Festival. Congressional elections =2004= Jennings lost the 2004 primary for the seat to the eventual nominee, Jan Schneider, by 47% to 38% in a four-candidate race, despite outspending Schneider by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1. \\"Her supporters attribute this outcome, though, to Jennings‚Äô late start, and they say her business background gives her both better cross-party appeal and stronger fundraising potential.\\" CQ Politics =2006= Jennings won 61.8% of the vote in the September 5, 2006 Democratic primary, having heavily outraised Schneider during the campaign. CQPolitics.com wrote that while Schneider had run game challenges to Harris as the Democratic nominee in 2002 and 2004, \\"[her] strongest appeal was to more liberal elements of the 13th District constituency, and many Democratic officials thought Jennings‚Äô business background would make her a more viable general election contender\\". CQ Politics Poll numbers showed Jennings with a lead, which varied from 2‚Äì12% based on five polls. CQ Politics In November, Jennings faced Republican Vern Buchanan, who won a bitterly fought Republican primary with 32.3% of the vote. Buchanan's fund-raising receipts more than tripled those of Jennings, including infusions of nearly $6 million of his own money. Jennings was endorsed by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the major newspaper in District 13.U.S. House, District 13 editorial board of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, October 18, 2006 After the votes were counted, Buchanan narrowly led Jennings by fewer than four hundred votes. In Sarasota County, Florida, there were almost 18,000 undervotes in the race. Some advocated for a revote, but that rarely occurs in Florida, and would have been a first in Florida for the federal office. In March 2007 a letter surfaced \\"in which Electronic Systems & Software Inc. (ES&S;)‚Äî the company that manufactured the electronic voting machines used in the Florida 13 election‚Äîtold election officials that the voting screens exhibited slow response times during testing.\\" The following week \\"California Democratic Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald, chairwoman of the House Administration Committee ... announced the formation of the task force\\" to investigate the election. The House committee dismissed Jennings' challenge on February 25, 2008, and affirmed the certified result of the FL-13 declaring Buchanan the winner of the 2006 election. The full House of Representatives affirmed the committee's findings in HR 989, declaring that machine error could not be demonstrated after a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review in Sarasota. Jennings dropped her challenge to the race shortly after to focus on her 2008 Congressional rematch against Buchanan. =2008= Jennings announced her intention to run for the 13th District seat once again in 2008. On September 6, 2007, she received the endorsement of Emily's List. Jennings lost to incumbent Vern Buchanan, taking just 37% of the vote. = Payroll tax controversy = In August 2007, while Jennings continued her court contest of the 2006 Congressional race results, the Herald-Tribune reported on a lawsuit filed by Democratic primary candidate Jan Schneider through the Federal Elections Commission (FEC). The lawsuit alleged that Jennings collected but failed to file and submit payroll taxes collected from her campaign staff during the 2006 election. Initially the Jennings campaign admitted that they had failed to pay $23,835 in payroll taxes during the campaign as a consequence of a paperwork error that was cleared up as soon as it was found. Said Jennings, \\"when I found out about it, I corrected it\\". However, the next day the Jennings campaign stated that the amount of unpaid payroll taxes was closer to $38,000, but IRS and campaign records indicated that the amount of repaid payroll taxes since July 2006 amounted to $70,126. The revelations followed a 2006 election where Jennings spoke at length about Buchanan's refusal to release his personal tax returns; upon the breaking of the controversy, Schneider referred to the news as a demonstration of \\"shameful hypocrisy\\" on the part of Jennings.

One of the first girls to attend school in British India, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with Sanskrit honours from Bethune College of the University of Calcutta in 1886 and started teaching there in the same year. Kadambini Ganguly, one of the first two women honours graduates ever in the country, was three years senior to her in the same institution. Nisith Chandra Sen, her brother, was a renowned barrister in the Calcutta High Court, and later the Mayor of Calcutta while her sister Jamini was the house physician of the then Nepal Royal family. In 1894 she married Kedarnath Roy. Writing and feminism She picked up the cue for feminism from a fellow student of Bethune School, Abala Bose. Speaking to a girls' school in Calcutta, Roy said that, as Bharati Ray later paraphrased it, \\"the aim of women's education was to contribute to their all- round development and fulfillment of their potential\\". In a Bengali essay titled The Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge she wrote, In 1921, she was one of the leaders, along with Kumudini Mitra (Basu) and Mrinalini Sen, of the Bangiya Nari Samaj, an organization formed to fight for woman's suffrage. The Bengal Legislative Council granted limited suffrage to women in 1925, allowing Bengali women to exercise their right for the first time in the 1926 Indian general election. She was a member of the Female Labour Investigation Commission (1922‚Äì23). Honors and laurels Roy went out of her way to encourage other writers and poets. In 1923, she visited Barisal and encouraged Sufia Kamal, then a young girl, to continue writing. She was president of the Bengali Literary Conference in 1930 and vice-president of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad in 1932-33. She was influenced by the poet Rabindranath Tagore and Sanskrit literature. Calcutta University honoured her with the Jagattarini Gold Medal. On 12 October 2019, Google commemorated Kamini Roy with a Doodle on her 155th birth anniversary.

At the age of 16, Posipal's family relocated to Germany. In his youth his sportive activities focused on swimming and track-and-field as well as handball.Bitter, J√ºrgen. Deutschlands Fu√üball Nationalspieler, Sportverlag, 1997, p. 368. In 1949 he joined Hamburger SV as then coach Georg Kn√∂pfle was looking for a forward. However Kn√∂pfle soon discovered that Posipal was a strong defender and withdrew him from attack to a half back position. Already a year later in 1950, West German national team coach Sepp Herberger intended to invite Posipal to join the squad for Germany's first international game after World War II, but officials found out that Posipal had a Romanian citizenship and no German. After he had become a West-German citizen in 1951, Posipal debuted in the international game against Turkey in West Berlin. In 1952, Posipal was moved from the right half back position to that of center half. In that position he was considered to be Germany's best during these years and one of the best in European football. In October 1953, he was invited to represent Europe in a game against England at Wembley Stadium. However, during the first round of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, Posipal had lost his form and after being injured for the quarterfinal against Yugoslavia, Kaiserslautern‚Äôs Werner Liebrich played as center half instead of Posipal. Being fit again for the semifinal against Austria, Herberger brought Posipal back to the starting team, but since Liebrich had played exceptionally well against Yugoslavia, Posipal played as a right full back at the expense of Fritz Laband. Herberger's trust in Posipal despite his lack of form in previous games paid off as Posipal did very well in the semifinal and the final in the unusual new position. For the rest of his international career, Posipal kept playing as right back with Liebrich as the center half. He finished his football career in 1958. Posipal died at the age of 69 in Hamburg of heart failure. He was married to Gisela and had two sons with her. His son Peer Posipal, who played for the Bundesliga team Eintracht Braunschweig, is a former professional football player as well. His grandson Patrick Posipal is also a professional footballer.

Overview Wei was born in 252 in Jining, Shandong in the former county of Rencheng (‰ªªÂüé). Her father, Wei Shu (È≠èËàí), was a government official. From an early age she displayed a propensity for studying the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi, and practising Daoist methods of cultivation. At the age of 24, she was married to Liu Wen (ÂäâÊñá) against her will by her parents and had two sons. After they grew up, she resumed her Daoist practices. At some point she became a libationer in the priesthood of the Celestial Masters sect of Daoism. According to her Shangqing hagiographers, her devotion to Daoist cultivation so impressed a number of immortals that she received revelations from them 31 volumes of Daoist scriptures which would become the foundation of Shangqing Daoism. Among these was the Yellow Court Classic (ÈªÉÂ∫≠Á∂ì), which detailed a form of Daoist meditation involving the visualizations of deities within the adept's body, a practice that would become a defining feature of Shangqing. Shangqing has sometimes been described as a \\"mystical\\" form of Daoism, emphasising the notion of the human body as a microcosm containing universal energies, which could be actualised by ecstatic union with deities. With the emphasis on meditation, there would be much less attention paid to physiological cultivation by ingesting herbs and drugs, which had been important in earlier forms of Daoism. When Wei's disciple Yang Xi (Ê•äÁæ≤) formally founded the Shangqing school, 30 years after her death, Wei was acknowledged as the first \\"patriarch\\" of Shangqing Daoism and, as an immortal, would be a source of continuing revelations. The sect would be centred on Mao Mountain (ËåÖÂ±±), situated to the south of Nanjing, and would thus be also known as the Maoshan sect. From the 6th to the 10th century, Shangqing would be the most prominent Daoist sect and would gain favour among aristocrats of the Tang dynasty. The Shangqing scriptures were regarded as possessing a high literary quality that previous Daoist scriptures did not, and their vivid esoteric imagery was an inspiration to artists and poets.

They were awarded a kingdom in the southeast of Bo County in Anhui called Mei kingdom. The M√©i ancestral hometown is located 60 miles southeast of Runan county, Henan province in central China. The first patriarch of the M√©i lineage was M√©i Bo or the Earl of M√©i. During King Zhou's reign (Shang Dynasty,1766-1122 BCE), M√©i Bo pleaded repeatedly to King Zhou to repent from his cruel and corrupt ways. M√©i Bo's convictions angered the erratic ruler, which he viewed as insubordination. As punishment, the Earl of M√©i was beheaded.

This is an example of a common shorthand notation for stability derivatives. The \\"M\\" indicates it is a measure of pitching moment changes. The \\\\alpha indicates the changes are in response to changes in angle of attack. This stability derivative is pronounced \\"see-em-alpha\\". It is one measure of how strongly an aircraft wants to fly \\"nose first\\", which is clearly very important. Stability derivatives, and also control derivatives, are measures of how particular forces and moments on an aircraft change as other parameters related to stability change (parameters such as airspeed, altitude, angle of attack, etc.). For a defined \\"trim\\" flight condition, changes and oscillations occur in these parameters. Equations of motion are used to analyze these changes and oscillations. Stability and control derivatives are used to linearize (simplify) these equations of motion so the stability of the vehicle can be more readily analyzed. Stability and control derivatives change as flight conditions change. The collection of stability and control derivatives as they change over a range of flight conditions is called an aero model. Aero models are used in engineering flight simulators to analyze stability, and in real-time flight simulators for training and entertainment. Stability derivative vs. control derivative Stability derivatives and control derivatives are related because they both are measures of forces and moments on a vehicle as other parameters change. Often the words are used together and abbreviated in the term \\"S&C; derivatives\\". They differ in that stability derivatives measure the effects of changes in flight conditions while control derivatives measure effects of changes in the control surface positions: ; Stability derivative: measures how much change occurs in a force or moment acting on the vehicle when there is a small change in a flight condition parameter such as angle of attack, airspeed, altitude, etc. (Such parameters are called \\"states\\".) ; Control derivative: measures how much change occurs in a force or moment acting on the vehicle when there is a small change in the deflection of a control surface such as the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. Uses =Linearization (simplification) of stability analysis= Stability and control derivatives change as flight conditions change. That is, the forces and moments on the vehicle are seldom simple (linear) functions of its states. Because of this, the dynamics of atmospheric flight vehicles can be difficult to analyze. The following are two methods used to tackle this complexity. ; Small oscillations about otherwise steady flight conditions: One way to simplify analysis is to consider only small oscillations about otherwise steady flight conditions. The set of flight conditions (such as altitude, airspeed, angle of attack) are called \\"trim\\" conditions when they are steady and not changing. When flight conditions are steady, stability and control derivatives are constant and can be more easily analyzed mathematically. The analysis at a single set of flight conditions is then applied to a range of different flight conditions. ; Application in simulators for stability analysis: In a flight simulator, it is possible to \\"look up\\" new values for stability and control derivatives as conditions change. And so, the \\"linear approximations\\" aren't as great and stability can be assessed in maneuvers that span a greater range of flight conditions. Flight simulators used for analysis such as this are called \\"engineering simulators\\". The set of values for stability and control derivatives (as they change over various flight conditions) is called an aero model. =Use in flight simulators= In addition to engineering simulators, aero models are often used in real time flight simulators for home use and professional flight training. Names for the axes of vehicles Air vehicles use a coordinate system of axes to help name important parameters used in the analysis of stability. All the axes run through the center of gravity (called the \\"CG\\"): *\\"X\\" or \\"x\\" axis runs from back to front along the body, called the Roll Axis. *\\"Y\\" or \\"y\\" axis runs left to right along the wing, called the Pitch Axis. *\\"Z\\" or \\"z\\" runs from top to bottom, called the Yaw Axis. Two slightly different alignments of these axes are used depending on the situation: \\"body-fixed axes\\", and \\"stability axes\\". =Body-fixed axes= Body-fixed axes, or \\"body axes\\", are defined and fixed relative to the body of the vehicle.:Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 78-31382 *X body axis is aligned along the vehicle body and is usually positive toward the normal direction of motion. *Y body axis is at a right angle to the x body axis and is oriented along the wings of the vehicle. If there are no wings (as with a missile), a \\"horizontal\\" direction is defined in a way that is useful. The Y body axis is usually taken to be positive to right side of the vehicle. *Z body axis is perpendicular to wing-body (XY) plane and usually points downward. =Stability axes= Aircraft (usually not missiles) operate at a nominally constant \\"trim\\" angle of attack. The angle of the nose (the X Axis) does not align with the direction of the oncoming air. The difference in these directions is the angle of attack. So, for many purposes, parameters are defined in terms of a slightly modified axis system called \\"stability axes\\". The stability axis system is used to get the X axis aligned with the oncoming flow direction. Essentially, the body axis system is rotated about the Y body axis by the trim angle of attack and then \\"re-fixed\\" to the body of the aircraft: *X stability axis is aligned into the direction of the oncoming air in steady flight. (It is projected into the plane made by the X and Z body axes if there is sideslip). *Y stability axis is the same as the Y body-fixed axis. *Z stability axis is perpendicular to the plane made by the X stability axis and the Y body axis. Names for forces, moments, and velocities  =Forces and velocities along each of the axes= Forces on the vehicle along the body axes are called \\"Body-axis Forces\\": *X, or FX, is used to indicate forces on the vehicle along the X axis *Y, or FY, is used to indicate forces on the vehicle along the Y axis *Z, or FZ, is used to indicate forces on the vehicle along the Z axis *u (lower case) is used for speed of the oncoming flow along the X body axis *v (lower case) is used for speed of the oncoming flow along the Y body axis *w (lower case) is used for speed of the oncoming flow along the Z body axis ::It is helpful to think of these speeds as projections of the relative wind vector on to the three body axes, rather than in terms of the translational motion of the vehicle relative to the fluid. As the body rotates relative to direction of the relative wind, these components change, even when there is no net change in speed. =Moments and angular rates around each of the axes= *L is used to indicate the \\"rolling moment\\", which is around the X axis. Whether it is around the X body axis or the X stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript). *M is used to indicate the name of the \\"pitching moment\\", which is around the Y axis. *N is used to indicate the name of the \\"yawing moment\\", which is around the Z axis. Whether it is around the Z body axis or the Z stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript). *\\"P\\" or \\"p\\" is used for angular rate about the X axis (\\"Roll rate about the roll axis\\"). Whether it is around the X body axis or the X stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript). *\\"Q\\" or \\"q\\" is used for angular rate about the Y axis (\\"Pitch rate about the pitch axis\\"). *\\"R\\" or \\"r\\" is used for angular rate about the Z axis (\\"Yaw rate about the yaw axis\\"). Whether it is around the Z body axis or the Z stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript). Equations of motion The use of stability derivatives is most conveniently demonstrated with missile or rocket configurations, because these exhibit greater symmetry than aeroplanes, and the equations of motion are correspondingly simpler. If it is assumed that the vehicle is roll-controlled, the pitch and yaw motions may be treated in isolation. It is common practice to consider the yaw plane, so that only 2D motion need be considered. Furthermore, it is assumed that thrust equals drag, and the longitudinal equation of motion may be ignored. . The body is oriented at angle \\\\psi (psi) with respect to inertial axes. The body is oriented at an angle \\\\beta (beta) with respect to the velocity vector, so that the components of velocity in body axes are: ::u=U \\\\cos\\\\beta ::v=U \\\\sin\\\\beta where U is the speed. The aerodynamic forces are generated with respect to body axes, which is not an inertial frame. In order to calculate the motion, the forces must be referred to inertial axes. This requires the body components of velocity to be resolved through the heading angle (\\\\beta) into inertial axes. Resolving into fixed (inertial) axes: ::u_f=U\\\\cos(\\\\beta)\\\\cos(\\\\psi)-U\\\\sin(\\\\beta)\\\\sin(\\\\psi)=U\\\\cos(\\\\beta+\\\\psi) ::v_f=U\\\\sin(\\\\beta)\\\\cos(\\\\psi)+U\\\\cos(\\\\beta)\\\\sin(\\\\psi)=U\\\\sin(\\\\beta+\\\\psi) The acceleration with respect to inertial axes is found by differentiating these components of velocity with respect to time: :: \\\\frac {du_f}{dt}=\\\\frac {dU} {dt} \\\\cos(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)-U\\\\frac {d(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)} {dt} \\\\sin(\\\\beta+\\\\psi) ::\\\\frac{dv_f}{dt}=\\\\frac{dU}{dt}\\\\sin(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)+U\\\\frac{d(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)}{dt}\\\\cos(\\\\beta+\\\\psi) From Newton's Second Law, this is equal to the force acting divided by the mass. Now forces arise from the pressure distribution over the body, and hence are generated in body axes, and not in inertial axes, so the body forces must be resolved to inertial axes, as Newton's Second Law does not apply in its simplest form to an accelerating frame of reference. Resolving the body forces: ::X_f=X\\\\cos(\\\\psi)-Y\\\\sin(\\\\psi) ::Y_f=Y\\\\cos(\\\\psi)+X\\\\sin(\\\\psi) Newton's Second Law, assuming constant mass: ::X_f=m\\\\frac{du_f}{dt} ::Y_f=m\\\\frac{dv_f}{dt} where m is the mass. Equating the inertial values of acceleration and force, and resolving back into body axes, yields the equations of motion: ::X=m\\\\frac{dU}{dt}\\\\cos(\\\\beta)-mU\\\\frac{d(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)}{dt}\\\\sin(\\\\beta) ::Y=m\\\\frac{dU}{dt}\\\\sin(\\\\beta)+mU\\\\frac{d(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)}{dt}\\\\cos(\\\\beta) The sideslip, \\\\beta, is a small quantity, so the small perturbation equations of motion become: ::X=m\\\\frac{dU}{dt} ::Y=mU\\\\frac{d(\\\\beta+\\\\psi)}{dt} The first resembles the usual expression of Newton's Second Law, whilst the second is essentially the centrifugal acceleration. The equation of motion governing the rotation of the body is derived from the time derivative of angular momentum: ::N=C\\\\frac{d^2\\\\psi}{dt^2} where C is the moment of inertia about the yaw axis. Assuming constant speed, there are only two state variables; \\\\beta and \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt}, which will be written more compactly as the yaw rate r. There is one force and one moment, which for a given flight condition will each be functions of \\\\beta, r and their time derivatives. For typical missile configurations the forces and moments depend, in the short term, on \\\\beta and r. The forces may be expressed in the form: ::Y=Y_0 + \\\\frac {\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial \\\\beta} \\\\beta +\\\\frac {\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial r}r where Y_0 is the force corresponding to the equilibrium condition (usually called the trim) whose stability is being investigated. It is common practice to employ a shorthand: ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial \\\\beta}=Y_\\\\beta The partial derivative \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial \\\\beta} and all similar terms characterising the increments in forces and moments due to increments in the state variables are called stability derivatives. Typically, \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial r} is insignificant for missile configurations, so the equations of motion reduce to: ::\\\\frac{d\\\\beta}{dt}=\\\\frac{Y_\\\\beta}{mU}\\\\beta-r ::\\\\frac{dr}{dt}=\\\\frac{N_\\\\beta}{C}\\\\beta+\\\\frac{N_r}{C}r Stability derivative contributions Each stability derivative is determined by the position, size, shape and orientation of the missile components. In aircraft, the directional stability determines such features as dihedral of the main planes, size of fin and area of tailplane, but the large number of important stability derivatives involved precludes a detailed discussion within this article. The missile is characterised by only three stability derivatives, and hence provides a useful introduction to the more complex aeroplane dynamics. This diagram shows lift as perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis. In most technical usage, lift is perpendicular to the oncoming flow. That is, perpendicular to the longitudinal stability axis. Consider first Y_\\\\beta, a body at an angle of attack \\\\beta generates a lift force in the opposite direction to the motion of the body. For this reason Y_\\\\beta is always negative. This diagram shows lift as perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis. In most technical usage, lift is perpendicular to the oncoming flow. That is, perpendicular to the longitudinal stability axis. At low angles of attack, the lift is generated primarily by the wings, fins and the nose region of the body. The total lift acts at a distance x_{cp} ahead of the centre of gravity (it has a negative value in the figure), this, in missile parlance, is the centre of pressure . If the lift acts ahead of the centre of gravity, the yawing moment will be negative, and will tend to increase the angle of attack, increasing both the lift and the moment further. It follows that the centre of pressure must lie aft of the centre of gravity for static stability. x_{cp} is the static margin and must be negative for longitudinal static stability. Alternatively, positive angle of attack must generate positive yawing moment on a statically stable missile, i.e. N_\\\\beta must be positive. It is common practice to design manoeuvrable missiles with near zero static margin (i.e. neutral static stability). The need for positive N_\\\\beta explains why arrows and darts have flights and unguided rockets have fins. . The effect of angular velocity is mainly to decrease the nose lift and increase the tail lift, both of which act in a sense to oppose the rotation. N_r is therefore always negative. There is a contribution from the wing, but since missiles tend to have small static margins (typically less than a calibre), this is usually small. Also the fin contribution is greater than that of the nose, so there is a net force Y_r, but this is usually insignificant compared with Y_\\\\beta and is usually ignored. Response Manipulation of the equations of motion yields a second order homogeneous linear differential equation in the angle of attack \\\\beta: :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\beta}{dt^2}-\\\\left(\\\\frac{Y_\\\\beta}{mU}+\\\\frac{N_r}{C}\\\\right)\\\\frac{d\\\\beta}{dt}+\\\\left(\\\\frac{N_\\\\beta}{C}+\\\\frac{Y_\\\\beta}{mU}\\\\frac{N_r}{C}\\\\right)\\\\beta=0 The qualitative behavior of this equation is considered in the article on directional stability. Since Y_\\\\beta and N_r are both negative, the damping is positive. The stiffness does not only depend on the static stability term N_\\\\beta, it also contains a term which effectively determines the angle of attack due to the body rotation. The distance of the center of lift, including this term, ahead of the centre of gravity is called the maneuver margin. It must be negative for stability. This damped oscillation in angle of attack and yaw rate, following a disturbance, is called the 'weathercock' mode, after the tendency of a weathercock to point into wind. Comments The state variables were chosen to be the angle of attack \\\\beta and the yaw rate r, and have omitted the speed perturbation u, together with the associated derivatives e.g. Y_u. This may appear arbitrary. However, since the timescale of the speed variation is much greater than that of the variation in angle of attack, its effects are negligible as far as the directional stability of the vehicle is concerned. Similarly, the effect of roll on yawing motion was also ignored, because missiles generally have low aspect ratio configurations and the roll inertia is much less than the yaw inertia, consequently the roll loop is expected to be much faster than the yaw response, and is ignored. These simplifications of the problem based on a priori knowledge, represent an engineer's approach. Mathematicians prefer to keep the problem as general as possible and only simplify it at the end of the analysis, if at all. Aircraft dynamics is more complex than missile dynamics, mainly because the simplifications, such as separation of fast and slow modes, and the similarity between pitch and yaw motions, are not obvious from the equations of motion, and are consequently deferred until a late stage of the analysis. Subsonic transport aircraft have high aspect ratio configurations, so that yaw and roll cannot be treated as decoupled. However, this is merely a matter of degree; the basic ideas needed to understand aircraft dynamics are covered in this simpler analysis of missile motion. Control derivatives Deflection of control surfaces modifies the pressure distribution over the vehicle, and these are dealt with by including perturbations in forces and moments due to control deflection. The fin deflection is normally denoted \\\\zeta (zeta). Including these terms, the equations of motion become: ::\\\\frac{d\\\\beta}{dt}=\\\\frac{Y_\\\\beta}{mU}\\\\beta-r+\\\\frac{Y_\\\\zeta}{mU}\\\\zeta ::\\\\frac{dr}{dt}=\\\\frac{N_\\\\beta}{C}\\\\beta+\\\\frac{N_r}{C}r+\\\\frac{N_\\\\zeta}{C}\\\\zeta Including the control derivatives enables the response of the vehicle to be studied, and the equations of motion used to design the autopilot.  Examples  *CL\\\\beta, called dihedral effect, is a stability derivative that measures changes in rolling moment as Angle of sideslip changes. The \\"L\\" indicates rolling moment and the \\\\beta indicates sideslip angle.

His best known work, Bharat Premkatha, is about the romances of epic Indian characters and has remained very popular in the Bengali literary world. Many of his stories have been adapted for classic Indian films, most notably Ritwik Ghatak's Ajantrik (1958) and Bimal Roy's Sujata (1959), and even today filmmakers search his works for suitable plots. He won the Filmfare Award for Best Story twice, for Bimal Roy's Sujata (1960) and for Gulzar's Ijaazat in 1989. He was selected for Bharatya Jnanpith Award (1977) But he refused it. Early life and education Born at Hazaribagh on 14 September 1909, now in Jharkhand, he studied in St. Columba's College and in the library of the well known philosopher and scholar, Mahesh Chandra Ghosh. Later, before starting his professional career as a writer, he worked as a bus conductor in state bus transport service to support his livelihood in Calcutta and continued his writing side by side. Career Literature He shot into prominence with such stories as Fossil. Thereafter, he went on to produce a rich harvest of varied stories. While his Bharat Premkatha delves into the classics for both form and content, presenting immortal love stories, his Kingbadantir Deshe is composed of local legends, which are believed to have really taken place in the past, and which gained in popularity through oral transmission. His personal knowledge about and deep insight into Adivasi life and his grounding in military history was always well respected. Pradip Bhattacharya has translated, or rather transcreated Bharat Premkatha into English as Love Stories from the Mahabharata.

Films gave him a break through to the vast Hindi-speaking world. His stories have been used for Hindi films as much as for Bengali films. Following on his critically successful 1944 debut Udayer Pathey, Bimal Roy shot Anjangarh in 1948, based on Subodh Ghosh's political drama Fossil, about collusion of aristocracy and business interests against the common man. Mrinal Sen's 1971 film Ek Adhuri Kahani, based on story, Gotrantar, which tells the story of a sugar mill and its agricultural neighbourhood where the workers are deprived of bare necessities and the farmers cheated. Agradoot's film Trijama in 1956 was based on his novel in the same name. Tapan Sinha picked up Subodh Ghosh's Jatugriha for a film on the same name, Jatugriha in 1964. Subodh Ghosh shot into limelight as the author whose work inspired classic films such as Ritwik Ghatak's Ajantrik (1958) and Bimal Roy's Sujata (1959). While Sujata was the story of romance between a Brahmin young man (Sunil Dutt)and an outcaste woman (Nutan), Ajantrik was the story of a taxi driver in love with his out dated vehicle. Subodh Ghosh won the Filmfare Best Story Award for Sujata. Both the films were made in the late fifties. Later, Subodh Ghosh won the Filmfare Best Story Award a second time, albeit posthumously, for Gulzar's Ijaazat, which was based on Jatugriho. The drama titled \\"Waiting Room\\" by noted Bangladeshi filmmaker Mostofa Sarwar Farooki is also based on this story. Basu Chatterjee made a Hindi film Chitchor (1976), starring Amol Palekar on his story, Chittachakor. Even a recent Sooraj R.

Many taxonomic authorities classified it in 2008 as a subspecies of the dark-eyed junco. In 2016, it was classified as a full species. Description and ecology This American sparrow has a dull grayish head with a gray bill and brownish upperparts. Its wings and tail are blackish, though the tail has white edges. Its underparts are white with a rufous fringe at the bottom of the wings. It makes a high, sharp sik and a long series of chipping notes. This bird is today found mainly in the Cupressus guadalupensis cypress grove on the island of Guadalupe, with a few birds in the remaining Guadelupe pine stands. Around 1900, it was known to utilize almost any habitat for breeding. It ranged over the whole island for feeding then, and indeed still does theoretically, but actually only a handful of flocks exist. A testimony to the adaptability of this junco is the fact that today a few birds breed at the seashore in non-native Nicotiana glauca tobacco shrub, since this is dense enough to provide some protection from cats. The breeding season is from February to June. Three to four eggs are laid in a bulky cup nest of dried grass stems, which is either in a depression in the ground or in the lower branches of a tree. The eggs are greenish-white with reddish-brown spots. If food is plentiful, the birds apparently breed twice a year. Decline to near-extinction This bird used to be abundant, but now only 50‚Äì100 adult birds are thought to survive. Goats introduced to provide food for fishermen and to start a meat canning plant in the early to mid-19th century became feral and overran the island by the late 19th century, with more than four goats per hectare (nearly two per acre) being present around the 1870s. Feral cats also multiplied, and as the habitat was destroyed by the goats, the cats wreaked havoc on the endemic fauna. In 1897, Kaeding found the Guadalupe junco \\"abundant\\", but already decreasing due to cat predation. Anthony summed up 10 years of occasional visits in 1901 by noting that \\"...the juncos are slowly but surely becoming scarce.\\" He blamed the interaction of goats destroying the habitat and cats destroying the birds themselves. W. W. Brown Jr., H. W. Marsden and Ignacio Oroso surveyed Guadalupe throughout May and June 1906, and collected numerous bird specimens for the Thayer Museum ‚Äì among these a \\"large series\\" of the Guadalupe junco.Though this probably was barely sustainable; it certainly was far more harmful that they shot \\"a series of flickers\\" and collected six clutches of eggs of this endemic subspecies. The Guadalupe red-shafted flicker (Colaptes auratus rufipileus) became extinct about five years later. They found the Guadalupe junco \\"fairly abundant\\" but, despite the depredations of the cats, still \\"a very tame, confiding little bird\\" ‚Äì in other words, unwary of predators. Feral goats were all but exterminated by 2006 by Grupo de Ecologia y Conservacion de Islas and Island Conservation, permitting spectacular regeneration of the native flora. The island was recently protected as a biosphere reserve again by the above groups. As habitat regenerates and especially if the planned removal or containment of cats will be undertaken, the remaining Guadalupe juncos will find more protected breeding and feeding sites. Indeed, the future of the Guadalupe junco looks better than it did during the 20th century, although it is still precariously close to extinction and could be wiped out by any chance event, such as a violent storm or an introduced disease. By IUCN, it is endangered. Footnotes Further reading * Howell, Steven N. G. & Webb, Sophie (1995): A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America.

The Japanese hoped to take the U.S. Pacific fleet by surprise and sink or damage a significant number of the fleet's aircraft carriers or other large ships.  The attack  The Azusa Special Attack Unit (), to which were allocated twenty-four \\"Yokosuka P1Y1\\" twin-engine bombers took off from the Kanoya Air Field on Kyushu, the southernmost of the main Japanese islands. The aircraft were bound for the US naval base at Ulithi on a one way trip at the limits of their range in an attempt to destroy the Fifth Fleet carriers at anchor there. Each of the planes carried an 800 kg (1,700-pound) bomb, which they intended to deliver by crashing onto the American flight decks. A number of support aircraft and submarines were used to help guide the attackers over their long flight. Some six of the P1Y1s suffered mechanical difficulties and had to turn back to their home base at Kanoya. Others landed at Yap island. Still others had to ditch at sea. Two of the twenty-four aircraft reached Ulithi, arriving after nightfall and achieving complete surprise. One aircraft hit the Essex class aircraft carrier USS Randolph in the stern just below the flight deck, killing 26 men and wounding 105, many of whom were watching a movie in the ship's hangar deck. The second aircraft crashed onto an access road on the small island of Sorlen, apparently mistaking the road with its nearby signal tower for a ship.

It is managed by NHS Grampian.  History  The hospital was founded as a result of a bequest by Dr Alexander Gray (d. 1807), who was born in Elgin but worked as a surgeon for the East India Company. His will was contested by his family, but eventually his bequest of ¬£20,000 'for the establishment of a hospital in the town of Elgin for the sick and poor of the county of Murray (Moray)' was proven in the Court of Chancery. The hospital was designed by James Gillespie Graham, featuring a large classical block with giant Doric columns that supported a portico and was topped with drum tower and dome. Work on building the hospital at the western end of the town's High Street started in 1815 and the hospital opened on 1 January 1819, providing 30 beds that could be used for any parishioner of Moray who could produce a note of recommendation from their local minister of the established church. Often those of the Episcopalian or Catholic faith were turned away, causing conflict with the Burgh council on a number of occasions. Some patients who required urgent assistance were sent home critically ill lacking the paperwork from the Kirk minister, ultimately causing their death.Letters, various - Dr Gray's Hospital, correspondence 1812-1865, The moray Council archives A ¬£22 million redevelopment of the hospital took place between 1992 and 1997 and included extensive refurbishment of existing facilities. The first stage, completed in May 1995, created a new complex for obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatric services, three new operating theatres and five new lifts. In January 1997 the second stage of redevelopment was completed, adding a new acute psychiatric ward and a new accident and emergency building. A sensory garden was opened in 2010 to provide patients, visitors and staff with an attractive place to relax. In 2012 a further ¬£3 million redevelopment project commenced.

Green Hills or Green Hills Ridge is the name given to the Cronulla sand dunes, just north of Wanda. History The original inhabitants of the land were the Gweagal Aborigines who were a clan of the Tharawal (or Dharawal) tribe of Indigenous Australians. They are the traditional custodians of the southern geographic areas of Sydney. Wanda is an Aboriginal word for beach or sand hills. The Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club was established in 1946 after World War II by a group of men who banded together, as they did in warfare, to patrol the beaches. The colours of Army red, Air Force blue, and Navy blue were adopted as the club colours. The club, located on Marine Esplanade, has grown in size to its current membership of over 900 male and female members, ranging in age from five-year-old Nippers to the original Founding Members. The primary objective of the club is to patrol the beach in an effort to ensure the safety of the surfing public but it is also actively involved in the competition arena, with excellent performances at State and National Competitions. A number of social activities are organised throughout the year to bring together members from all sections of the club. In 1965 the beach became notorious after the Wanda Beach Murders.

His work was heavily influenced by subversive art movements including Dada and Fluxus, and, having received numerous cease and desist orders, Wong become known for appropriating work by others. He used the term \\"paraconceptual\\" to describe his art. Background Wong was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on June 10, 1974. He attended the University of Toronto for two years, subsequently moving to New York City in 1997 to continue his education at the Cooper Union School of Art, where he studied art and architecture, eventually concentrating on sculpture. He earned a certificate in art in 2000. He met his American-born partner of five years Timothy Edward \\"Tim\\" Dubitsky, an artist and designer, in New York City in 2004. Wong committed suicide on May 30, 2010, at his East Village apartment in New York City at the age of 35. A New York Times report after Wong's death investigated his long history of parasomnia or sleep disorders, his ability to perform \\"elaborate tasks that require(d) agency and concentration\\" during sleep, and his partner's conviction that Wong hanged himself while sleep walking. Work At Cooper Union, he became known for his personal style and his clear message‚Äîas well as a neon sign (reading \\"anus\\") in his East Village apartment window. Typical of his early work are installations with a large number of the same industrial product which he would stack or assemble to create architectural shapes. Other presentations are more conceptual and question the meaning of how we consume or what we consume today, borrowing forms and ideas from contemporary industrial design and luxury objects and presented in the context of design stores and industry magazines. File:Killer-Ring, Tobias Wong, Philipp Mohr 2004.jpgKiller Ring, 2004 In collaboration with the designer Philipp Mohr he created the Diamond Project series and the \\"hidden diamond ring\\" which features a diamond on the inside of a wedding band as well as an engagement ring with a reverse diamond. Along with Ken Courtney of Ju$t Another Rich Kid he launched a collection of luxury products cast in gold. One of his most acclaimed designs is his Ballistic Rose, a rose pin made of black bulletproof material. It has been included in the design collection at MoMA. Wong participated in Terminal 5, a 2004 art exhibit at the then-dormant TWA Flight Center at the John F. Kennedy International Airport curated by Rachel K. Ward and featuring the work of 18 artists. The show featured work, lectures and temporary installations drawing inspiration from the idea of travel -- and the terminal's architecture. The show was to run from October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2005 -- though it closed abruptly after the building itself was vandalized during the opening party. In 2006 Wong collaborated with London-based product design company SUCK UK to launch his environmentally conscious \\"Sun Jar\\", which continues to prove one of his greater commercial accomplishments.by SUCK UK http://www.suck.uk.com/product.php?rangeID=50&search;_text=sun Retrieved on February 10, 2011 In 2007 Wong arranged for a colleague to assume his identity for a presentation at Core77‚Äôs Offsite speaker series. Rama Chorpash, designer and Chair of the Undergraduate Industrial Design Department at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, stayed in character throughout the presentation and during a subsequent question-and-answer period. The ruse is consistent with Wong's subversive design oeuvre. Wong's work included events including a pop‚Äëup tattoo parlor at Art Basel Miami Beach/Design Miami and the Wrong Store, a \\"store\\" in New York that actually never opened. He served as founding co‚Äëcreative director of 100% Design Shanghai in 2008 and 2009, affiliated with the 100% Design fairs in London and Tokyo. Wong created a \\"book-gun\\" called I Want To Change The World, spoofing Karim Rashid‚Äôs similarly titled monograph that had been cut out in the shape of a gun. Wong's work was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, SFMOMA and Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum.

The depot is visible from the West Coast Main Line, to the south-east of Willesden Junction, on the way into London's Euston Station. The depot code is WN. History The original Willesden Locomotive Depot in November 1962The original locomotive servicing facility at Willesden was on the south side of the main line, west of the station, which closed in 1965. It was replaced by the present facility. Shed Layout The depot was designed in the 1960s, to service electric locomotive classes AL1 to AL6 (TOPS classes 81 to 86) and subsequently class 87s, and consists of six parallel shed roads (each holding four locomotives inside the shed) and several arrivals and departure sidings externally. There is also a road that runs round to the north of the shed and this provides access to the fuel siding, (which for many years was used only for the occasional fueling of diesel shunters), and also to the DC lines of Willesden Junction Low Level station, which is used to move multiple units from the shed onto the North London Line after servicing. The arrival and departure sidings contain two connections to the West Coast main line onto the up slow. At the east end of the depot, there is a trailing crossover to permit access onto the down slow when coming off depot. Facilities The depot as viewed from the westbound North London Line platform at . These include offices, a workshop and reasonably large stores. The workshop contains high quality facilities for pantograph overhaul, tap- changer overhaul and brake equipment test and servicing. In more recent years, especially since the loss of AC electric locomotives, the fuel siding was promoted to other train operators as a facility at Willesden and a means to generate some revenue, this meant for instance that Gospel Oak to Barking Line DMUs did not need to travel to Bletchley TMD and back each night for 'A' examinations and fuelling which could instead be carried out at Willesden.

S. Forester featuring his fictional naval hero Horatio Hornblower. It was first published in the 9 December 1950 issue of The Saturday Evening Post as \\"Hornblower's Temptation\\" and then in the UK in the April 1951 Argosy as \\"Hornblower and the Big Decision.\\" It was published as \\"Hornblower and the Widow McCool\\" along with the unfinished novel Hornblower and the Crisis and the short story \\"The Last Encounter\\" in 1967, after Forester's death. The story is set after Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and before Lieutenant Hornblower. Plot summary The story opens in the winter of 1799-1800 when \\"until three months before, [Hornblower] had been a prisoner in Spanish hands.\\" He is the most junior of five lieutenants in the ship of the line HMS Renown. The ship has just captured a French vessel, and one of the prisoners is recognised as Irish revolutionary Barry McCool. Admiral William Cornwallis gives Hornblower the distasteful task of arranging McCool's execution for desertion from the Royal Navy. Cornwallis insists that McCool is to make no final speech before his execution, so that he cannot try to incite mutiny among the Irish sailors in Renown's crew. Hornblower is unwilling to prevent McCool speaking by gagging him. However, in return for a promise by McCool not to speak before he is hanged, Hornblower agrees to send McCool's only possession, a sailor's sea chest with his name \\"B I McCOOL\\" in raised letters on the carved lid, to his widow, along with a covering letter. He is prevented from immediately doing so when Renown has to put hastily to sea after McCool is executed. While at sea, Hornblower discerns a message hidden in an oddly clumsy poem in McCool's letter. By moving the letters of the carved name in a sequence and in a manner revealed by the poem, a secret compartment forming the lid of the chest is revealed. The compartment is stuffed with currency notes and secret correspondence to other Irish rebels, in fact \\"Everything one would need to start a rebellion,\\" as Hornblower comments to himself. Hornblower, revolted at the spectacle of McCool's execution and suspecting the money could be French counterfeits, decides to spare other Irishmen from the gallows and throws the chest overboard. Later, \\"when the Renown lay in the Hamoaze, completing for the West Indies,\\" he discovers that McCool actually left no widow, and the chest was intended to reach an Irish revolutionary society. As McCool's letter said, he had remained \\"faithful unto death,\\" though to the cause of Irish independence, not a woman. Hornblower now throws McCool's final letter overboard too.

He is first mentioned in 86 BC, when he was sent by Mithridates, with an army of not less than 110,000 men, to make his way through Thrace and Macedonia to provide support to Archelaus in Greece. This task he successfully accomplished. He reduced Amphipolis, which had at first defied his arms, and having thus struck terror into the Macedonians, advanced, without further opposition, through that country and Thessaly into Phocis. Here he at first laid siege to Elateia, but was foiled in his attacks, and relinquished the enterprise, in order to meet up with Archelaus in Boeotia. The two Pontic generals now found themselves at the head of a formidable host, but their combined forces were defeated in 86 BC by Sulla near Chaeronea, with great slaughter.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, \\"Sulla\\", 15-16, 19; Memnon, History of Heraclea, 3; Pausanias, Description of Greece, i. 20, ix. 40, x. 34 From this time no more is heard of Taxiles until 74 BC when he commanded (together with Hermocrates) the great army with which Mithridates invaded Paphlagonia and Bithynia in the autumn of that year. During the subsequent operations at the siege of Cyzicus, he is mentioned as giving the king the most judicious advice.Appian, Roman History, \\"The Mithridatic Wars\\", 70, 72 After the defeat of the king and his retreat into his own territories, Taxiles shared with Diophantus the command of the army which Mithridates sent to oppose Lucullus near Cabira, 72 BC, where their skilful arrangements for a time held the balance of success doubtful, and reduced the Roman general to considerable straits for provisions. At length, however, the campaign was terminated by a total rout, in which the Pontic camp fell into the hands of the enemy.Memnon, 4; Appian, 79-82; Plutarch, \\"Lucullus\\", 15, 17 Taxiles accompanied Mithridates on his flight into Armenia, and subsequently (69 BC) he is mentioned as present with Tigranes at the great Battle of Tigranocerta, on which occasion he, in vain, endeavoured to restrain the overweening confidence of the Armenian monarch. This is the last time that his name occurs in history.Plutarch, \\"Lucullus\\", 27 References *Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Taxiles (2)\\", Boston, (1867) Notes 1st-century BC people Ancient Greek generals Ancient Pontic Greeks Taxila Tehsil ","title":"Taxiles (Pontic army officer)"},{"id":"5731190","title":"Daniel Berthiaume"},{"id":"5731199","text":"Andr√© Oktay Dahl Andr√© Oktay Dahl (born 7 July 1975, in L√∏renskog) is a Norwegian law graduate who was a politician representing the Conservative Party. He served as a representative of Akershus in the Storting and was first elected in 2005. He was a reserve candidate in the two previous periods, and took Jan Petersen's seat while Petersen was a cabinet minister from 2001-2005. He was also elected to the regional Parliament of Akershus between 1999-2006, where he amongst others led the standing Committee on Scrutiny. Dahl has also led the Akershus Conservatives, his party's biggest regional party, between 2008-2012. During his time in parliament he focused on fighting homophobia, fighting for female rights, anti-corruption and fighting against child abuse. In January 2008 he made accusations that were considered harsh against controversial Norwegian defense attorney Tor Erling Staff who was then defense attorney for the suspected Pocket Man, a Norwegian pedophile predator. Attorney Staff had asserted that the bulk of the cases with which his client was charged amount to mere \\"peanuts\\". Dahl's position was that by downplaying the severity of the abuse, Staff in fact victimized the victims again. Dahl is a former victim of child sexual abuse, and he is also openly gay. He was rewarded for both his work for gay rights as well as his openness about his own experiences of child sexual abuse. He was member of the board of several organizations working against homophobia and violence towards men as well as women. Dahl served as his party's central spokesperson in judicial matters and was central in the discussions after the terrorist attacks in Norway after the 22nd of July in 2011. Occasionally he tried to get his party to discuss whether Norwegian anti-drug policy \\"worked\\" and if criminalization works. He is now a member of the think tank \\"Foenix\\" which works to get better help for people addicted to drugs. After leaving the Norwegian Parliament, Dahl took the position as account director in Norway's biggest consultancy firm, Gambit Hill + Knowlton. He is still partly active in public debates, especially considering the core issues he engaged in when being an elected MP; child abuse, human rights and LHBT- issues. In 2015 he withdrew his membership of the Conservative Party to become politically independent.\\"H√∏yre-topp melder seg ut etter 12 √•r p√• Stortinget: ‚Äì Har aldri passet inn\\". VG. 17.01.2015. In an interview given to the weekend magazine \\"Dagbladet Magasinet\\" in March 2015 he stated the reason he left politics was that he wasn't sure any more about central political solutions by any political party and did not want to engage any more in party politics. He said he had been approached by several different parties, but wants to stay independent until he knows more about where he stands politically. He also stated that there were \\"no personal conflicts or dissatisfaction of not being given a position within the new Government\\" that made him withdraw. If he wanted a position he would \\"have asked for renomination\\", he added in the same interview. Dahl is also known to be a former highly skillful clarinet player and planned to be a professional musician.

He was conferred the title of Vednataratna for his immense knowledge of the religious scriptures and philosophy. Life He was the son of Ramjay Ghosh of Pabna (now in Bangladesh), he initially studied first arts and then graduated from City College, Kolkata. He joined New School at Barddhaman as a teacher and then moved on to Hazaribagh. He became head master of Hazaribagh Zilla School, a position he held till retirement. When his elder brother, Radhacharan Ghosh, joined the Brahmo Samaj, he became his follower. In those days, it meant social ostracism but the spirited brothers did not worry about that. However, the environment at Hazaribagh was more mahesh and the local Bengali community extended support to the Brahmo Samaj irrespective of their personal beliefs and attachment to creeds. He succeeded Sashi Bhusan Ghosh as Secretary of Hazaribagh Brahmo Samaj and served for a long period from 1916 to 1930. It was during his term as Secretary that the small Brahmo community at Hazaribagh split and a separate Nava Bidhan Mandir (affiliated to the group led by Keshub Chunder Sen and his followers) was established. It was a fall- out of the bitter feelings then prevailing amongst Brahmos owing allegiance to different units. A lifelong bachelor, he used to practice homeopathy and distribute free medicines to the poor. Erudition He was vastly learned in history, oriental and occidental philosophy, religion and scriptures, and knew several languages. He had deep knowledge of the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Buddhism and Christianity. He wrote extensively in newspapers and magazines. Some these were collected and published in book form as Buddhaprasanga. He had a large collection of books in his personal library. The noted Bengali author Subodh Ghosh, then a young man in search of knowledge, was a regular visitor to the library. During the period, Hazaribagh was a place of regular visit for learned people from Kolkata. They used to go there for change of climate. Many of them gathered at his house or rather library for exchange of ideas. Even amongst the local population there were great scholars such as the poet Kamini Roy and Kharga Singha Ghosh, a learned professor in St. Columba's College. It was not only the climate that attracted people from outside but also the warmth of hospitality of the local population and the environment of learning and devotion.

Catte Street is a historic street in central Oxford, England.Catte Street, off High Street, Oxford, Oxford History, UK. Location Catte Street runs north-south, continuing as Parks Road to the north (beyond a junction with Broad Street and Holywell Street). The street passes along the eastern side of Radcliffe Square and forms a junction with the High Street to the south. At the northern end to the west is the Clarendon Building on Broad Street, with the Sheldonian Theatre nearby. Just to the south is the Bodleian Library. To the east are the Modern History Faculty (formerly the Indian Institute building), and the Bridge of Sighs over New College Lane which is part of Hertford College. Further south on the east side is All Souls College, a college with Fellows but no undergraduate students. To the west at the southern end are the Radcliffe Camera and the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, the main church of the University, on the High Street. The southern end of the street, by the junction with the High Street, has been pedestrianised, with a pavement, since 1973. History The name of this street was recorded as Kattestreete in the early 13th century, as Mousecatchers' Lane (Vicus Murilegorum) in 1442, and as Cat Street in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century it became Catherine Street.N.B. \\"Cat\\" being one of the short forms of Catherine. However, there was another street of this name in east Oxford and in 1930 the City Council changed the name to Catte Street, using a 15th-century spelling. Originally this street used to lead northwards as far as New College Lane, where the city wall blocked its way. The road north from here has become part of Catte Street, although the Modern History Faculty still gives its address as Broad Street nearby. In the mid-13th century the illuminator William de Brailes owned property, and presumably had his workshop, next to St Mary's. The street was pedestrianised as a pavement at the south by the junction with the High Street in 1973.  Cultural associations  Catte Street is mentioned in Philip Pullman's fictional works, His Dark Materials trilogy and Lyra's Oxford. The street inspired the name of a local 1970s jazz band, the \\"Catte Street Rhythm Wreckers\\".

The murders Smith‚Äôs girlfriend, Misty Erwin, reported that Smith battered her and requested police assistance to move out of the house. However, when police arrived, she withdrew her complaint and decided to stay with Smith. Two days later her body was found in the house along with a cousin, two small children, and a babysitter. All were shot to death with a rifle. Smith was arrested the day after the bodies were discovered. His capture followed a shootout with authorities near Star City in Lincoln County, Arkansas. Smith fled into a wooded area when police tracked him down to a house belonging to a local hunting club. Smith held police at bay for an hour with a rifle, which later proved to be the murder weapon. He was shot in an arm after he refused to put down the rifle. During the stand- off, he yelled at the police, \\"I sent three of them to Heaven; I don't know where the other two went.\\" Smith made several admissions during the stand-off, until he was shot in the arm by police. He claimed that the murders were drug- induced. Appeals Smith quickly waived all rights to appeal his sentence. A judge ruled in November 1999 that Smith was competent enough to waive his appeal rights. At the hearing, Smith told the court he was sorry for the pain he had caused and added, \\"I don't want to do any more harm.\\" Jefferson County Circuit Judge H.A. Taylor said Smith had knowingly waived his appeal and understood the implications. The Arkansas Supreme Court, in a routine review of death-row cases, affirmed Smith's convictions. The justices allow inmates to drop their appeals if they demonstrate that they know what might happen. Smith said he made the decision because he didn't want to put his family or the victims' families through a lengthy appeal process. Smith was the third consecutive death row inmate to waive at least part of his appeal rights. Execution Clay King Smith spent his final days writing letters. Smith wrote letters to the families of each of his victims asking for forgiveness and telling them he would waive his right to appeal unless they asked him to do otherwise. No one did. In a letter dated April 22, Smith told Misty Erwin's father, Randy, her mother Lula, and her three sisters, Tabitha, Margo and Frances, that he was waiving his right to appeals so that they could move on with their lives. \\"You don't need to keep reliving what happened over and over and that's what appeals would do,\\" Smith wrote. \\"If you all want me to appeal you should let me know and I will. Otherwise, I'm going home to be with Jesus. I can hardly wait. I believe I am going to see Misty there...\\" In a brief final statement, while strapped to a gurney in the execution chamber at Cummins Unit, he spoke to four family members of his victims as they watched on a closed circuit television. \\"I'd like to say I'm sorry about what I did to the victims' families. I hope your hearts heal. I love my family. I love my family.\\" Smith was the 24th person executed by the State of Arkansas since Furman v. Georgia, , after new capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas that came into force on March 23, 1973.  In the media  The story of the murders as told through the eyes of Smith's brother, police officer Walt Chavis, was discussed on \\"The Cop and the Killer\\" of Evil Lives Here. The episode (Season 3, Episode 8) premiered on February 25, 2018.

Common names include southern catalpa, cigartree, and Indian- bean-tree (or Indian bean tree). Description It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall, with a trunk up to diameter, with brown to gray bark, maturing into hard plates or ridges. The short thick trunk supports long and straggling branches which form a broad and irregular head. The roots are fibrous and branches are brittle, its juices are watery and bitter tasting. The leaves are large and heart shaped, being 20‚Äì30 cm long and 15‚Äì20 cm broad. The bright green leaves appear late and as they are full grown before the flower clusters open, add much to the beauty of the blossoming tree. They secrete nectar, a most unusual characteristic for leaves, by means of groups of tiny glands in the axils of the primary veins. 200px The flowers are 2.5‚Äì4 cm across, trumpet shaped, white with yellow spots inside; they grow in panicles of 20-40. In the northern states of the USA, it is a late bloomer, putting forth great panicles of white flowers in June or early in July when the flowers of other trees have mostly faded. These cover the tree so thickly as almost to conceal the full grown leaves. The general effect of the flower cluster is a pure white, but the individual corolla is spotted with purple and gold, and some of these spots are arranged in lines along a ridge, so as to lead directly to the nectar within. A single flower when fully expanded is two inches long and an inch and a half wide. It is two-lipped and the lips are lobed, two lobes above and three below, as is not uncommon with such corollas. The flower is perfect, possessing both stamens and pistils; nevertheless, the law of elimination is at work and of the five stamens that are expected to be found, three have aborted, ceased to bear anthers and have become filaments simply. Then, too, the flowers refuse to be self-fertilized. Each flower has its own stamens and its own stigma but the lobes of the stigma remain closed until after the anthers have opened and discharged their pollen; after they have withered and become effete then the stigma opens and invites the wandering bee. The entire Pink family behave in this way. 300px Catalpa bean pods The fruit is a long, thin bean pod like capsule 20‚Äì40 cm long and 8‚Äì10 mm diameter; it often stays attached to tree during winter. The capsule contains numerous flat light brown seeds with two papery wings. It is closely related to the Northern Catalpa (C. speciosa), and can be distinguished by the flowering panicles, which bear a larger number of smaller flowers, and the slightly slenderer seed capsules. * Bark: Light brown tinged with red. Branchlets forking regularly by pairs, at first green, shaded with purple and slightly hairy, later gray or yellowish brown, finally reddish brown. Contains tannin. * Wood: Light brown, sapwood nearly white; light, soft, coarse-grained and durable in contact with the soil. * Winter buds: No terminal bud, uppermost bud is axillary. Minute, globular, deep in the bark. Outer scales fall when spring growth begins, inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, become green, hairy and sometimes two inches long. * Leaves: Opposite, or in threes, simple, six to ten inches long, four to five broad. Broadly ovate, cordate at base, entire, sometimes wavy, acute or acuminate. Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent. Clusters of dark glands, which secrete nectar are found in the axils of the primary veins. They come out of the bud involute, purplish, when full grown are bright green, smooth above, pale green, and downy beneath. When bruised they give a disagreeable odor. They turn dark and fall after the first severe frost. Petioles stout, terete, long. * Flowers: June, July. Perfect, white, borne in many-flowered thyrsoid panicles, eight to ten inches long. Pedicels slender, downy. * Calyx: Globular and pointed in the bud; finally splitting into two, broadly ovate, entire lobes, green or light purple. * Corolla: Campanulate, tube swollen, slightly oblique, two-lipped, five-lobed, the two lobes above smaller than the three below, imbricate in bud; limb spreading, undulate, when fully expanded is an inch and a half wide and nearly two inches long, white, marked on the inner surface with two rows of yellow blotches and in the throat on the lower lobes with purple spots. * Stamens: Two, rarely four, inserted near the base of the corolla, introrse, slightly exserted; anthers oblong, two-celled, opening longitudinally; filaments flattened, thread-like. Sterile filaments three, inserted near base of corolla, often rudimentary. * Pistil: Ovary superior, two-celled; style long, thread-like, with a two-lipped stigma. Ovules numerous. * Fruit: Long slender capsule, nearly cylindrical, two-celled, partition at right angles to the valves. Six to twenty inches long, brown; hangs on the tree all winter, splitting before it falls. Seeds an inch long, one-fourth of an inch wide, silvery gray, winged on each side and ends of wings fringed.  Induced Defenses  A 2003 study by J. Ness showed that when a hawkmoth caterpillar Ceratomia catalpae started eating the leaves of C. bignonoides, the leaves produced extra nectar. The nectar in turn attracted a greater number of bodyguard ants Forelius pruinosus to the damaged leaves, thus giving added protection to the whole plant. This is an example of a tree exhibiting a symbiotic relationship with nearby insects.300px Distribution In the USA, Catalpa bignonioides is undoubtedly a Southern tree. Europeans first observed the tree growing in the fields of the Cherokee Native American tribes, who called it Catalpa. However, it can flourish in the North as well, and accordingly its original range is somewhat in doubt. Despite its southern origins, it has been able to grow almost anywhere in the United States and southernmost Canada, and has become widely naturalized outside its restricted native range. Cultivation and uses It is widely grown as an ornamental tree. The catalpa has the distinction of bearing some of the showiest flowers of all the American native trees. Its value in this respect has long been recognized and it holds an assured place in the parks and gardens of all temperate countries. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, as has the gold-leafed variety C. bignonioides 'Aurea'. The purple-leaved hybrid Catalpa √ó erubescens 'Purpurea' syn. C. bignonioides 'Purpurea', has also achieved the award (confirmed 2017). It prefers moist soil and full sun. It is easily raised from seeds which germinate early in the first season. It also multiplies readily from cuttings. The tree is fairly free from fungal diseases and has few insect enemies. The wood is brittle and hard, but does not rot easily; it is used for fence posts and railroad ties. Catalpa bignonioides contains varying levels of iridoid glycosides that deter generalist herbivores, but which are tolerated by and concentrated in Ceratomia catalpae caterpillars. These caterpillars have a longstanding ecological relationship with the tree, and may defoliate a tree three or more times in a summer without killing it. Fishing enthusiasts prize the caterpillars as bait, particularly for catfish, and may freeze them for months after collecting them in the spring. It is one of two parents of the interspecific hybrid tree √ó Chitalpa tashkentensis. The other parent is Chilopsis linearis. The cross was done by a Russian in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The hybrid is sterile and at least two crosses exist, 'White Cloud' and 'Pink Dawn'. History The genus was common in Europe during the Tertiary period and its fossil remains have been discovered in the Miocene rocks of the Yellowstone River.

It was located in the descendent settlement of Anhaica (also as Anhayca Apalache or Inihayca) capital of Apalachee Province. The mission was part of Spain's effort to colonize the Florida Peninsula and to convert the Timucuan and Apalachee Indians to Christianity. The mission lasted until 1704 when it was evacuated and destroyed to prevent its use by an approaching militia of Creek Indians and South Carolinians. The site where the mission stood was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on October 15, 1966. In 1996, a project began to reconstruct some of the mission buildings on the site, based on archeological and historical evidence. History Apalachee Province was one of the most powerful and wealthy chiefdoms or provinces in Florida and the Apalachee were the most advanced native peoples in Florida surpassing the Timucua, Potano, Tocobaga, and Calusa. The Apalachee were part of the Mississippian culture of mound builders and had well-established administrative and religious systems. First contact In 1528, P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez is the first recorded European presence in Apalachee setting up camp south of Anhaica near present-day St. Marks. In 1539, Hernando de Soto wintered at Anhaica (in present-day Tallahassee) celebrating the first Christmas in the North America. In 1607, some Apalachee Indians requested friars and the first ones visited in 1608. In 1612 the Apalachees made a formal request for a mission but the Spanish did not oblige. In 1625 Apalachees began to send food supplies overland to St. Augustine, the major point of Spanish control over shipping and defense of La Florida. The Spanish, however, needed the densely populated and extremely fertile Apalachee Province to provide labor and provisions for St. Augustine. In 1633, Pedro Mu√±oz and Francisco Mart√≠nez launched a formal mission effort in Apalachee Province. In 1638 the first of 3 or 4 soldiers came to Apalachee Province to explore for ports and purchase foodstuffs for the governor. No evidence has been discovered indicating a fort or garrison was built then. Spanish rule The Mission San Luis de Apalachee as it may have appeared in the 17th century. From 1645 to 1651 soldiers lived at Asile Hacienda on Apalachee Province's eastern border. The soldiers and deputy governor were both removed late in 1651 and did not return until mid-1654 under a new governor. In 1656, Spanish authorities decided to establish their western capital on one of the region's highest hilltops for strategic purposes. San Luis was described by Spanish military authorities as extending for miles and being completely indefensible. The inhabitants of old San Luis moved to the present site at the request of the Spaniards. The garrison was expanded to 12 and San Luis's chief promised to build a substantial blockhouse for them. Under pressure from other Apalachee, San Luis's chief said that 6 soldiers would suffice. Although the governor planned for further expansion of the garrison and building a regular fort, Apalachee opposition to the project stalled it for well over a generation. The blockhouse at San Luis was described in 1675 as a \\"fortified country house.\\" From 1656 to 1680 the size of the garrison varied between 12, 19, and 25 men. The Apalachee men and women were excellent agriculturists and provided much of the food for San Luis as well as for export to such places as St. Augustine and Havana. The first deputy governor, Claudio Luis de Florencia, arrived in 1645. Luis de Florencia lived with his extended family at old San Luis. Nothing is known about the nature of his residence. By 1675 more than 1,400 Spaniards and Apalachee lived under the jurisdiction of San Luis. There were very few Spanish women creating a situation where the Spanish soldiers frequently married Indian women as a means to Christianize the native population and make them more \\"civilized.\\" While the size of most other Apalachee missions declined sharply over the years, the population of San Luis increased. =Buildings= The buildings at San Luis included Spanish and Apalachee residential areas, the Franciscan Church and Spanish fort, as well as the native Council House, which was one of the largest historic Indian structures in the southeastern United States at the time holding 2,000‚Äì3,000 people. In the early 1680s, the blockhouse was pulled down and replaced with a temporary makeshift barracks. The garrison was then expanded to 40 men, and sometimes even more for special expeditions. In 1688, San Marcos de Apalache at St. Marks was also built from lumber cut at San Luis, but it was left to rot when the skilled laborers were diverted to construct a fort in Apalachicola country in 1689. This fort was staffed by 20 soldiers and 20 Apalachee warriors. From 1695‚Äì1697 San Luis's new blockhouse was built. In mid-April 1696, the governor reported that it was completed except for one- third of the roof. Work was then suspended because of the spring planting. In 1698, San Luis Apalachees were seriously alienated when Spaniards commandeered some of their houses and land; Spaniards also took lumber intended for church repairs and forced Indians to build houses for them. In October 1702, an attempt to turn the blockhouse into a proper fort began after the defeat of a Spanish-Apalachee force on the Flint River. The fort would have a palisade and parapets, as well as a dry moat. It was apparently completed in 1703 despite the impact of a severe epidemic. At the end of July 1704, following a devastating series of raids by English and Creek raiders, the diminished Spanish garrison destroyed the fort and withdrew to St. Augustine. Beginning in 1996, Renker Eich Parks Architects, of St. Petersburg, Florida, with Herchel Sheperd, FAIA, undertook designing the reconstruction of many of the buildings in the mission using archeological and historical evidence to conjecture the architecture of the buildings to how they would originally have been built. The buildings that have since been reconstructed include the Church, the Convento, the Council House, the Chief's House, the Fort and Blockhouse, and a typical Spanish House as well as many minor features around the site.

The building sits adjacent to the site once earmarked for Silvertown Quays - a now-defunct regeneration project which was intended to include Britain's first purpose-built national aquarium, Biota! - and the failed London Pleasure Gardens. Eastern Quay was designed by Gardner Stewart Architects, and constructed by Morrisons. Standing 12 stories high, it is constructed with a concrete and steel frame. It is one of the first residential apartment blocks in the United Kingdom to have fully glazed exterior walls. The increased solar gain on such a building is reduced by a combination of integrated design and advanced glazing technology. The building has a 1.8-metre-wide terrace that wraps around the entire floor, a dual- purpose design providing generous terraces to each apartment and providing shade to the unit below. Furthermore, Low-emissivity glazing which is spectrally selective in order to minimize solar heat gain is installed across the building. The apartment block is located on an east‚Äìwest axis, exactly 1 km east of the Prime Meridian. The apartments on the north side overlook Royal Victoria Dock and the ExCeL Exhibition Centre, while apartments on the south side do not overlook the River Thames at all. Eastern Quay won various awards from construction, including one from the Chartered Institute of Building. In the summer of 2003, the London Evening Standard gave away one of the new-built apartments in its annual summer 'Win a ¬£250,000 Home' competition. The nearby Millennium Mills building and its surrounding derelict land are frequently used as TV and film locations, notably BBC's Life on Mars and ITV drama The Bill.  Transport  Eastern Quay is served by three Docklands Light Railway stations, all of which are equidistant: Pontoon Dock, West Silvertown and Custom House. The building has 42 underground parking spaces and 12 external spaces. The surrounding area is run by Newham Council and is free of parking restrictions. Eastern Quay is on the take off and approach corridor to London City Airport and as such is frequently exposed to aircraft noise from 6:30 to 21:00 (or latter when flights are late). The expansion of the London City Airport should increase the current level of noise which in upper floors reach up to 120 decibels.  History  Eastern Quay was sold by George Wimpey City PLC. It featured 73 units; 67 2-bedroom apartments; 2 duplex units and 4 penthouses. Prices ranged from ¬£245,000 for 1st-floor rear-facing apartments up to ¬£425,000 for the 11th-floor penthouses.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 104 and NY 104A south of the Wayne County village of Red Creek to a junction with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in the Onondaga County city of Syracuse. The western and central portions of the route pass through mostly rural areas; however, the eastern section serves densely populated areas of Onondaga County, including the villages of Baldwinsville and Liverpool. NY 370 also passes through Cayuga County, where it connects to NY 34, a major north‚Äìsouth highway in Central New York. NY 370 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a Red Creek‚ÄìLiverpool highway, replacing NY 40 west of Cato and New York State Route 37 from Cato to Baldwinsville. From Liverpool to Syracuse, modern NY 370 was initially part of NY 57, a route that continued north from Liverpool to Oswego. That route was eliminated in 1982, at which time NY 370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY 57's former routing. Other minor changes, namely a series of realignments west of Victory, have also occurred in the years since NY 370 was assigned. Route description Approaching Ridge Road on NY 370 westbound in Wolcott Maintenance of the route is also split in a similar fashion. West of Syracuse, the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Within Syracuse, the highway is city-maintained. =Red Creek to Baldwinsville= NY 370 begins at an intersection with NY 104 and NY 104A south of the village of Red Creek in the northeastern Wayne County town of Wolcott. The route heads southwest from this spot, utilizing a northeastward extension of Ridge Road that was part of US 104 prior to the construction of the super two highway now used by NY 104. After passing of open farmland, the route breaks from Ridge Road and travels southeast through the Town of Butler and to the Cayuga County line. The rural surroundings follow NY 370 across the county line and into the town of Victory, where the highway briefly takes on a more easterly alignment as it intersects NY 38 in the town center. Past NY 38, NY 370 gradually curves southward for roughly to reach the Victory‚ÄìConquest town line. Here, it overtakes the east‚Äìwest Conquest‚ÄìVictory Town Line Road and heads eastward along the town line toward the village of Cato. Just west of Cato village, NY 370 enters nearby Ira and the town of Cato. The route continues along the town line into the small village of Cato, where it becomes Main Street and meets NY 34 in the village center. At this point, NY 370 leaves the town line and heads northeast into Ira at the eastern village line. While in Ira, the highway leaves the village of Cato and passes by Cato‚ÄìMeridian Central School, located in an otherwise nondescript area of the town dominated by farmland. At the school, the road curves back to the southeast to serve the village of Meridian and reenter the town of Cato. Here, the route reverts to a generally easterly alignment, one that it retains for the next to Baldwinsville. East of Meridian, NY 370 crosses more cultivated fields as it intersects the south end of NY 176 and crosses into Onondaga County. Across the county line, NY 370 enters the town of Lysander and becomes known as West Genesee Road. It runs across another of rolling farmland before it begins to parallel the Erie Canal, here part of the Seneca River. At this point, the open fields gradually give way to pockets of residential development as the route approaches the village of Baldwinsville. West of the village limits, NY 370 connects to NY 31 and NY 690 at NY 690's continuation of Interstate 690's (I-690) northernmost grade-separated interchange. NY 31‚Äîwhich overlaps with NY 690 south of the junction‚Äîleaves the freeway and joins NY 370 for a overlap that takes both routes along the north bank of the canal and into the densely populated village. They remain overlapped through Baldwinsville's central business district, where they meet NY 48 at Oswego Street. =Syracuse area= Running alongside Onondaga Lake on NY 370 westbound near Liverpool At the eastern edge of the village center, NY 31 and NY 370 split, with NY 31 retaining the Genesee Street name and heading northeast towards Oneida Lake. NY 370, meanwhile, travels southeast on Salina Street, loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward Syracuse. The route intersects NY 631 before leaving Baldwinsville and heading into another rural section of Lysander. This open stretch ends at the canalside hamlet of Cold Springs, which serves as the beginning of the Syracuse suburbs. After passing through the community, NY 370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of Salina. Not far from the canal is a junction with John Glenn Boulevard, a four-lane arterial connecting NY 370 to Interstate 690 (I-690). Past John Glenn Boulevard, NY 370 passes over the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) near exit 38 and begins to approach the northern shore of Onondaga Lake as it enters the village of Liverpool on 2nd Street. In the village's commercial center, NY 370 intersects Oswego Street, which connects to I-90, once part of NY 57 and now NY 931G, an unsigned reference route. Here, NY 370 turns onto Oswego Street for one block before veering southeastward onto Onondaga Lake Parkway, a four-lane highway running along the northeastern shoreline of Onondaga Lake. This section of the route also parallels the CSX Transportation-owned St. Lawrence Subdivision, which crosses the highway by way of a low, overpass southeast of Liverpool. The parkway ends from Liverpool at the eastern tip of the lake, where the route connects to I-81 at exit 24\\\\. NY 370 continues through the interchange, following the two-lane Park Street into the city of Syracuse. In its first few blocks in the city, the highway passes under the Mohawk Subdivision‚ÄîCSX's main line across Central New York‚Äîand serves both NBT Bank Stadium and the Central New York Regional Market. East of the market, the route continues for one more block through an industrial area of Syracuse to Wolf Street, where NY 370 ends at US 11 and NY 298 Truck northwest of downtown Syracuse. History NY 370 west at NY 631 in Baldwinsville The portion of NY 370 east of Oswego Street in Liverpool was originally designated as part of Route 34, an unsigned legislative route, in 1908. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, Route 34 became the basis for NY 20, a highway extending from Syracuse to Oswego via Liverpool and Fulton. NY 20 was renumbered to NY 57 in 1927 to eliminate duplication with the newly assigned US 20. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. To the west, the section of modern NY 370 from Upton Road west of the hamlet of Victory to NY 34 in Cato was designated as part of NY 40 in the mid-1920s. West of Victory, NY 40 followed Upton Road and Canada Street before terminating at NY 3 (now NY 104A) in Red Creek. Although the portion of what is now NY 370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926, it remained unnumbered until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-NY 31 (now NY 48) in Baldwinsville became NY 37\\\\. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY 370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY 40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY 40 became part of the new NY 370, which also extended southeastward to NY 57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY 40 from NY 3 to Upton Road was included in NY 3E (later US 104). The portion of NY 370 west of Victory was realigned in the late 1950s to follow its modern alignment to a new terminus at US 104 (Ridge Road) southwest of Red Creek. After US 104 (now NY 104) was rerouted to follow a new super two highway through the Red Creek area in the early 1970s, the portion of Ridge Road between the super two east of Wolcott and NY 370 southwest of Red Creek became a westward extension of NY 370. The route was altered slightly at some point in the late 1970s or early 1980s to follow Ridge Road northeast to NY 104 instead. In May 1982, the NY 57 designation was eliminated after the portion of the route north of Liverpool was removed from the state highway system. From Tulip Street to the Onondaga‚ÄìOswego county line, NY 57 was redesignated as County Route 91 (CR 91) but signed as CR 57. The portion of NY 57's former routing between NY 370 in Liverpool and US 11 in Syracuse became part of an extended NY 370.

The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century. Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species. The symbol of Fauna in Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse (Azeri: Qarabaƒü atƒ±) which is a mountain- steppe racing and riding horse which can only be found in Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. The horse was originally developed in the Azerbaijani Karabakh region in the 5th century and is named after it. General information The Caucasian goat can be found at the mountains of Caucasus. Animal resources are mainly used for food (meat, egg, butter canned food), as raw materials in industry (feather, leather, horns and technical oil). People use animals as working power in agriculture. At the same time drugs, perfumes, fertilizers and fodder are produced from animals\` products. Some animals in Azerbaijan are endangered because of threats from changing environments or predators. These animals are entered into the Red Book of the Azerbaijan. Presently the Red Book includes 108 species of animals (14 species of mammals, 36 species of birds, 13 species of reptiles and amphibians, 5 species of birds and 40 species of insects). The natural habitat of various types of animals is very different within the country. Some species populate special restricted areas (lakes, parts of mountainous areas) while others are spread throughout the country. For example, passerines can be found anywhere in the territory of Azerbaijan. Protozoa parasites are also registered in all areas of the country, depending on natural habitat of carrier animals (cattle, poultry, etc.). Among mammals, jeyran gazelles populate plain areas, Caucasian goat inhabits the major Caucasus areas, most species of birds can be found in forests, some in water basins. Pest insects occupy different agricultural fields, while others populate defined biotopes only. A number of natural preserves have been created and the hunting rules were brought into effect for protection of fur and hoofed animals in Azerbaijan. Animal kingdom The animal kingdom of Azerbaijan is very rich, partly due to diversity of its natural complexes. There are 97 species of mammals, 357 species of birds, 67 species of reptiles and amphibians, 97 species of fish, and over 15 thousand species of invertebrates in Azerbaijan. =Mammals= Some 107 species of mammals have been recorded in Azerbaijan, three of which are unique species. Popular species are Caucasus goats and west-Caucasus moufflons; which inhabit Nakhchivan and western slopes of the major Caucasus in Balakan, Qabala, Zaqatala and Ismayilly regions. Jeyran gazelles are among the rarest and fastest species in Caucasus they can only be found in Shirvan natural preserve, Bendovan and Korchay regions of Azerbaijan. In 2014, 150 gazelles were returned to their historical territories as part of the four-year \\"Reintroduction of gazelles to their historical habitat areas in Caucasus\\" project. Caucasus goat is generally found in high altitudes of the Caucasus where the air is very thin and predators are rarely found. Comparing with domestic goats Caucasus goat's fur is very thick, and thanks to it the animal is well adapted to low temperature of the mountains. The Caucasus mouflon, a wild type of sheep, is bigger and muscular than domestic sheep. The mouflons prefer the plains where they can graze the whole year. These agile rock climbers have long and muscular legs. Thanks to this feature they can run very fast. The Caucasian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana), one of the rarest animals in the world, inhabits the southern Caucasus Mountains, Zangezur Range and the Talish Mountains in Azerbaijan. Caucasian leopards are endangered because of illegally hunt, human disturbance, etc. The World Wildlife Fund has stated that these animals are one of the most critically endangered species in the Caucasus Mountains. The Caspian tiger, also called Hyrcanian tiger was found in Azerbaijan until the late 1950s. But it became extinct over 40 years ago. Scientific investigation in this field proved that the Caspian Tiger and the Siberian Tiger are distinguished by only one genetic code letter. The last Caspian tigers were seen in foothills of Talysh Mountains and the Lenkoran river basin which are situated in south of Azerbaijan in 1964. The fauna of Greater Caucasus which is natural boundary in the north of Azerbaijan is very rich include mammals such as lynx, Caucasian brown bear, Asiatic wildcat, European badger, stone marten, red and roe deer, chamois, East Caucasian ibex, Caucasian squirrel, field mice, Daghestan pine vole. Ismayilli Nature Reserve near Gebele district of Azerbaijan is one of the places where you can see wild goats. Asiatic wildcat, jungle cat, and wild boar inhabit the Samur Forest, located at the Caspian coast near the Russian border. Absheron National Park, which is located in the Absheron Peninsula, is famous for its gazelles and Caspian seal haulouts. Five-toed jerboas, social vole, grey dwarf hamster are common in the territory of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. The natural inhabitants of Gobustan, Kyzylagach and Shirvan national parks are jackals, wolves, foxes, marbled polecats, hares, giant ditch frogs, huge flocks of migratory birds, jungle cat, golden jackal, boar, Eurasian water vole, etc. Gobustan is also famous for rock art. Talysh Mountains of Azerbaijan are covered with dense forests, where Caspian shrew, Schelkovikov‚Äôs pine vole, and Hyrcanian field mouse, southern white-breasted hedgehog, Levantine mole, western barbastelle, steppe and Black Sea field mice, and Indian crested porcupine are common. Hirkan National Park is located here. Nakhchevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan have some rare mammals and reptiles. More common species such as Macedonian mouse, Vinogradov‚Äôs and Persian jirds, social vole, and Transcaucasian mole vole. Pallas‚Äôs cat is the rarest animal in the area. =Fish= In the early history of Azerbaijan, sturgeon used to be mistaken for a sea monster. The country's fresh water basins and the Caspian Sea account for 97 species of fish of which eight introduced and seven of these have become widespread and over 15 thousand species of invertebrates in Azerbaijan. Most can be found in the Kura River, surrounding lakes, as well as in the Mingechevir reservoir. Most of fish are anadromous or semi- anadromous (the young grow up in salt water and migrate to fresh water to breed after they reach maturity). The most valuable of anadromous fish are salmon, sturgeon, stellate sturgeon and beluga. Aspius, Chalcalburnus and eel are also anadromous fish. Sturgeon meat and caviar are highly valuable. Beside, the water basins of Azerbaijan contain such valuable fish species as bream, sazan, rutilus kutum and others. Such fish species as herring are fished in the Caspian Sea. Due to the construction of a number of hydrotechnical plants on the Kura river after 1959, the regulation of the river water flow, as well as the Caspian water pollution led to the significant reduction in the number of valuable fish species. Three hatcheries (Kuragzi, Alibayramli and Kur experimental sturgeon hatchery) for melioration and fish-farming purposes were launched to restore the fish reserves and to increase the number of fish in species. Azerbaijan's fish-farming establishments and hatcheries account for breeding of 20 million sturgeons, 600 thousand salmons, over 800 thousand. A new hatchery with the capacity of 20 million sturgeons was put in commission in Khyly in 2000. Two new fish species (Stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) and Korean sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus)) have been discovered in Azerbaijan in 1970s. Stone morocco lives in all inland waters of Azerbaijan. Korean sharpbelly also is river fish living in Kura and Araz rivers, in the rivers of Lankaran region, Mingachevir water reservoir. Both of them can be found in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea from Absheron peninsula to Astara region. The oldest specimen of Korean sharpbelly found in the rivers is five years old with a length of 150 mm and weighs 25.4 grams. =Avifauna= Azerbaijan is incredibly rich in avifauna. There are 363 species of birds recorded from about 60 families, ranges from the large birds such as vultures, eagles, flamingos, pelicans, cranes to different kinds of colorful little birds such as bee-eaters, Hoopoe, woodcock, little stint, as well as water fowls including ducks, geese and swans. Around 40% of the species are staying all year in Azerbaijan, 27% overwinter there, and 10% pass through on migration. One of the most inspiring bird species is the golden eagle which inhabits mainly mountainous areas such as Nakhchivan. The golden eagle has been printed on dozens of stamps and cards in Azerbaijan. The winter in Azerbaijan is not cold, relatively mild. Therefore many birds from north migrate here in winter. Water birds such as swans, geese, ducks, flamingos, and waders like Black-tailed Godwit, curlews, and snipes usually collect in the wetlands, coastal and inland areas of Azerbaijan. Common and Great Black-headed Gulls may be found along the coast. In winter some small birds from north also chose Azerbaijan for wintering. Most birds of the alpine zone, like Guldenstadt's Redstart and Great Rosefinch move to river valleys to winter. In February waterfowl and shorebirds move north. Hoopoe and Barn Swallow arrive early from the south. =Molluscs= =Other= Ten species of amphibians from five families are recorded in Azerbaijan. There are 52 species of reptiles found in Azerbaijan. Most of these species are found in semi-desert areas in Shamakhi and Nakhchivan. Few are found in other lowlands or mountainous areas. In 1937, members of the Opilio lepidus species of harvestman were sited in the country.

It is used by handicapping systems to equalize the field by accounting for the likelihood that, when playing on more difficult courses, higher handicap players' scores will rise more quickly than their handicaps would otherwise predict. The term was invented by the United States Golf Association. History of slope rating With the aim of developing their handicap system in order to account for variances in golf course playing difficulty for golfers of different abilities, in 1979 the USGA setup the Handicap Research Team (HRT). Two years earlier, in 1977, then Lt. Commander Dean Knuth, a graduate student at the Naval Postgraduate School, had devised improvements to the course rating system, including weighted ratings of ten characteristics for each hole, to provide an adjustment to the distance rating for the course. It was to be the basis for the present USGA Course Rating System. Later, while living in Norfolk, Virginia, he developed a method for Bogey Rating by analyzing data gathered from average ability volunteers scores played on the local courses. Knuth went on to serve as the USGA's Senior Director of Handicapping for 16 years, beginning in 1981. The result of the Knuth's and HRT's work was a calculation based on the difference between the course rating and bogey rating to give a numerical measure of the difference in difficulty for the scratch and bogey golfer that could be used to adjust golfer's handicaps dependent on the course being played. This remains the basis of what is now called the slope system. In 1982, the Colorado Golf Association rated all of its courses using the new procedure, under the leadership of HRT member Dr. Byron Williamson. In 1983, Colorado tested the Slope System with positive results. Five other states joined Colorado in the test during 1984, before the slope system began being implemented nationally from 1987. Since January 1, 1990, every golf association in the United States that rates golf courses uses the USGA Course Rating System. The USGA Course and Slope Rating System forms the basis for many of the world's foremost handicapping systems, including the World Handicap System, jointly developed by the USGA and The R&A;, that is set to be introduced globally starting in 2010. USGA Slope Rating The USGA Slope Rating is a numerical value that indicates the relative difficulty of a set of tees on a golf course for a bogey golfer in comparison to a scratch golfer. It describes the fact that when playing on a more difficult course, the scores of higher-handicapped players will rise more quickly than those of lower handicapped golfers. The slope rating of a set of tees predicts the straight-line rise in anticipated score versus USGA course handicap, as in the mathematical slope of a graph. Slope ratings are calculated as a multiple of the difference between the expected good score for a bogey golfer (handicap in the range 20 to 24), called the bogey rating, and the expected good score for a scratch golfer (zero handicap), called the USGA Course Rating. The course and bogey ratings are determined by course raters, who measure and record more than 460 variables on a standard course rating form for each set of tees. Slope ratings are in the range from 55 to 155, with a course of standard playing difficulty having a rating of 113. In order to calculate the slope rating, the difference between the bogey and scratch rating is multiplied by 5.381 for men and 4.240 for women. : \\\\mbox{Slope Rating (men)} : \\\\mbox{5.381} \\\\times (\\\\mbox{Bogey Rating} - \\\\mbox{USGA Course Rating}) : \\\\mbox{Slope Rating (women)} : \\\\mbox{4.24} \\\\times (\\\\mbox{Bogey Rating} - \\\\mbox{USGA Course Rating}) References Golf terminology ","title":"Slope rating"},{"id":"5731288","text":"Michael James Bryant (Mike Bryant) (born 1 May 1960, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, EnglandBBC Radio One, Peel Sessions Artist Page: Fluke (link).) is an English electronic musician and one of the co-founders of the electronic music group Fluke along with Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier.

It is also a large-scale art installation, an exhibition, a catalogue and a CD album. The film The film comprises one hundred sequences showing a location in the city of Geneva, Switzerland. In 1994, over a period of one hundred days, one hundred white wooden staircases were installed around the city to be climbed by the public. At the top of each staircase was a simple hole framing a \\"living picture postcard\\", a perfect \\"cinema-image by Peter Greenaway\\" accompanied by a commentary of one sentence in French and English, printed below the viewfinder. Greenaway's idea was to create a reflection on location in cinema and to \\"take films out of the theatres\\". The event Spotlights of different colors were installed throughout the city. The event was called \\"The Stairs: Geneva The Location\\", and was expanded into a wider project including other cities and other cinematic themes of relaxation. The events were also published in a catalogue form and a musical compact disc (Merrell, March 1995). Stairs 001 - Geneva - Photo Christophe Gevrey The installation Approximately one hundred performers representing typical regional characters, with costumes and props, (Calvin and his fellows reformers, different spirits of the lake, Laura Ashley with her bicycle, living statues, etc.), were sited within the framed view of the staircases' viewfinders. They all were specially trained to perform a choreography (by Serge Campardon) every 15 minutes. Each performer was given a luxury Genevan watch to check the time throughout the five or more hours of their performance. Further details The film's scenes show day or night views in the exact frame defined by the staircase's viewfinder. Superimposed images make some of the characters of the installation appear and disappear in the frame under different lights, and are linked with different kind of local events, such as a cycle race or a children's choir on the cathedral steps. The voice-over patiently helps the visual description by numbering the scenes by the same number of each staircase, and reading the sentence printed on the viewfinder. Each scene is accompanied by a one-minute music pattern by Patrick Mimran,. The soundtrack CD which accompanies the project suggests each piece can be played randomly, just as a visitor could visit the staircases in any order. An exhibition was also set in the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire where lights and slide projections supplemented a display of one hundred sculpted heads found and chosen in the museum depot, as well as one hundred historical helmets.

The development of the 200S, codenamed Tipo 52 started in 1952, led by Giulio Alfieri. In response to Ferrari's 500 Mondial racing car which featured a 4 cylinder engine and was quite successful in sports car racing. The car had a inline-four light-alloy engine, featuring dual Overhead valves per cylinder and DOHC camshafts, double Weber 50DCO3 (first few cars only) or 45DCO3 carburetors. The engine was rated at at 7,500 rpm. Many chassis components were identical to the Maserati 150S in order to speed up development, except the rigid rear axle inherited from the Maserati A6. Maserati 250 SI Maserati made the first three chassis internally, but outsourced a tubular chassis to Gilco which was modified by Maserati. The first five aluminum bodies were made by Celestino Fiandri, and the 23 final bodies were made by Medardo Fantuzzi. The 200S debuted at the 1955 Imola Grand Prix, driven Franco Bordoni, but yielded disappointing results. The 200S was then entered at the 1955 Targa Florio driven by Giovanni Bracco and Bordoni along with a 150S. Both cars were forced to retire, with Maserati winning the race with a A6GCS driven by Francesco Giardini. In 1956, Maserati entered three new 200S' at the Supercortemaggiore GP. Problems with the suspension would be resolved by fitting two cars with a De dion bridge attached to the differential with a sliding pin at the rear. The third car had a conventional rear axle. The first car suffered damage in practicing round while the second one would retire during the race after only one lap. The third car would finish 27 seconds behind the winning Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa. At the Bara GP, the car would show more promising results by winning the race outright. In 1957 a new variant called the Maserati 200SI, Sport Internazionale, was introduced to conform to international sports car racing rules. The SI featured a wider windscreen, wipers, doors and a neat hood design to keep the rain out when the car was parked rather than protecting the driver from these elements during a race. The 200S was replaced by the 250S which featured an enlarged engine. Most of the 250S cars were 150S and 200S converted to 250S specifications. Only two cars were built from the ground up. The 250S also proved uncompetitive.

RIAs are produced in many countries, although their scope, content, role and influence on policy making vary.  Role  The role of an RIA is to provide a detailed and systematic appraisal of the potential impacts of a new regulation in order to assess whether the regulation is likely to achieve the desired objectives. The need for RIA arises from the fact that regulation commonly has numerous impacts and that these are often difficult to foresee without detailed study and consultation with affected parties. Economic approaches to the issue of regulation also emphasize the high risk that regulatory costs may exceed benefits. From this perspective, the central purpose of RIA is to ensure that regulation will be welfare-enhancing from the societal viewpoint - that is, that benefits will exceed costs. RIA is generally conducted in a comparative context, with different means of achieving the objective sought being analysed and the results compared.  History and development  The first RIAs are generally considered to be the \\"inflation impact assessments\\" required by the Carter Administration in the United States from 1978. The RIA requirement was broadened during the Reagan administration, with benefit‚Äìcost analysis becoming the required methodological approach. Another early adopter of a RIA requirement was Australia (1985). By the mid-1990s approximately 12 OECD countries had implemented RIA requirements of some form, although the scope of the required analysis varied considerably. By 2000, 20 of 28 OECD countries had implemented RIA requirements.OECD (2002)Regulatory Policies in OECD Countries: From Interventionism to Regulatory Governance. p 45. Currently, virtually all OECD countries use RIA. RIA requirements had also begun to be strongly promoted to its client countries by the World Bank. As a result, an increasing number of developing countries have now adopted RIA requirements.Reyes, R., Romano A. & Sottilotta, C.E. (2015) Regulatory Impact Assessment in Mexico: A Story of Interest Groups Pressure, Law and Development Review Vol. 8 No 1, pp. 99-121. https://doi.org/10.1515/ldr-2014-0030 RIA requirements have broadened in scope over time in many countries in which they have been adopted. Conversely, few if any countries have abandoned the use of RIA after having adopted it.OECD (2002)p. 45  Canada  In Canada, almost all new federal regulations are required to have a regulatory impact analysis statement (RIAS). A RIAS is made up of six parts: description, alternatives, benefits and costs, consultation, compliance and enforcement, and contact. Department of Justice Canada. Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement. http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/pub/legis/rm-mr/part4/rias-reir.html  EU  The European Commission introduced an impact assessment system in 2002, integrating and replacing previous single-sector type of assessments. In the European Commission perspective, Impact Assessment (IA) is a process aimed at structuring and supporting the development of policies. It identifies and assesses the problem at stake and the objectives pursued. It identifies the main options for achieving the objective and analyses their likely impacts in the economic, environmental and social fields. It outlines advantages and disadvantages of each option and examines possible synergies and trade-offs. In 2005 and 2006 the Commission updated its approach to include economic, social and environmental dimensions, thus moving in the direction of Sustainability Impact Assessment.Thomas F. Ruddy, Lorenz M. Hilty: Impact assessment and policy learning in the European Commission. In: Environmental Impact Assessment Review, Vol. 28, No. 2-3. (2007), pp. 90-105. There has also been a 2009 update.Jacopo Torriti, Ragnar E. L√∂fstedt: The first five years of the EU Impact Assessment system: a risk economics perspective on gaps between rationale and practice. In: Journal of Risk Research, Vol. 15 No 2, (2012), pp. 169-186.  UK  In the United Kingdom, RIAs have for many years been a key tool in helping improve the quality of regulation and reduce unnecessary burdens on business. RIAs have been produced by Central Government departments for many years using guidance produced by the Better Regulation Executive (BRE) in the Cabinet Office. In May 2007 a new system of Impact Assessments (IAs) was introduced and made fully operational in November 2007. BRE, now part of DBERR is responsible for the IA process. The aim of IAs is to help improve policy making by placing a greater emphasis on quantifying benefits and costs in the IA. The removal of the word 'Regulatory' was also a recognition that many Government burdens on business, the third sector and public bodies were not always implemented as legislation or regulations e.g. codes of practice, reporting requirements or funding guidance, and that the impacts of these measures also needed to be assessed.  Lithuania  External pressure (membership in the EU) influenced the adaptation of impact assessment in Lithuania‚Äôs public administration; however, there was also internal demand from a small group of civil servants with academic qualification. Naturally, more demand was stimulated by the European Union law impact assessment because it was financed from the national budget, the PHARE programme, and Denmark. In 2003, the government approved the Decision Project Impact Assessment Methodology for projects of national legal acts. In 2009, the Prime Minister's office began implementing the three-year project \\"Valdymo, orientuoto ƒØ rezultatus, tobulinimas (VORT)\\" (\\"Improvement of Result-oriented Management\\"). The implementation of the VORT project changed the direction of the impact assessment system development in several ways. The title of the resolution was changed to \\"Approval of the Prospective Regulatory Impact Assessment Methodology\\". In this methodology, new concepts were introduced: prospective regulatory impact assessment, legislation initiative, or priority legislative initiatives.Dvorak, J. (2015).

McGahern's best known novel, it is also considered his greatest work. Published by Faber and Faber, the novel tells the story of Michael Moran, a bitter, ageing Irish Republican Army (IRA) veteran, and his tyranny over his wife and children, who both love and fear him. It was shortlisted for the 1990 Booker Prize and won The Irish Times/Aer Lingus Literary Award in 1991. Plot introduction The novel is set in County LeitrimThe 100 best novels: No 97 ‚Äì Amongst Women by John McGahern (1990), The Guardian, Monday 27 July 2015 Retrieved 2016-03-07. in the rural midlands of Republic of Ireland. The story spans a period of twenty years in the middle of the twentieth century. It centres on Michael Moran, patriarch of the Moran family and a former IRA member who was an officer and guerrilla fighter in the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War in the 1920s. Although Moran is a well-respected member of his community and a devout Catholic, there is a cruel, violent, and controlling side to his character. He dominates the lives of his second wife, Rose, and his five children. His children strive to establish their own lives while remaining loyal to the family. Most of the story is told through the use of flashbacks, as Moran's daughters attempt to recreate Monaghan Day for their elderly and depressed father, because it was the day when he always seemed to be at his best. Explanation of the novel's title The title can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, the title refers to Moran's largely female household, with much of the book focusing on the domineering relationship between the patriarchal Moran and the women surrounding him. The title also references the traditional prayer, the Hail Mary, which contains the clause \\"blessed art thou amongst women\\". This prayer is significant as it is part of the Rosary, which is prayed every day in the Moran household, and the event is a repeating motif throughout the novel. Plot summary The novel opens with an elderly, weak, and depressed Michael Moran being taken care of by his daughters. Although they have busy lives and families of their own in Dublin and London, they have never really left the family home because they feel more important there. They have decided to recreate \\"Monaghan Day,\\" an event Moran always seemed to enjoy, hoping that this will somehow reverse his failing health. Monaghan Day was a market day, when Moran's friend McQuaid used to visit and they would reminisce about the war. The family's story is told through the use of flashbacks as the women in Moran's life remember the past. Moran was a once prominent Republican who fought for Irish independence in the 1920s. He is now a widower with three daughters and two sons. They live in a house called \\"Great Meadow\\" on a small farm in the west of Ireland. He thinks that his time in the IRA was the best of his life, and misses the security provided by the military's structure, rules, and clear demarcation of power. In his old age, however, he is bitter about the \\"small-minded gangsters\\" that are now in charge of the Republic of Ireland. For example, he refuses his soldier's pension because he feels that the government has betrayed the ideals that he fought for in his youth. He transfers the violent nature that served him well in battle to his dealings with his family. Moran's controlling nature is shown from the very first flashback narrative. On a past Monaghan Day, Moran petulantly refuses to yield to McQuaid's authority, \\"an authority that had outgrown\\" his own. McQuaid leaves abruptly and ends their long friendship. This is a defining moment for Moran, after which he withdraws into \\"that larger version of himself,‚Äù his family, over which he exercises absolute authority. Through his influence, the outside world is kept at an \\"iron distance\\", and the family unite against it. Moran marries a local woman called Rose Brady when his children are teenagers. Rose is in middle-age when she marries Moran. Despite her mother's warning that he is \\"one sort of person when he's out in the open among people ‚Äì he can be very sweet ‚Äì but that he's a different sort of person altogether behind the walls of his own house,\\" she is determined to marry him. She becomes a mother to the children and is their mainstay. For example, she helps Maggie to leave for London to become a nurse. She often alleviates the disputes between Moran and the children. She is quietly tolerant of Moran's mood swings, even when he verbally abuses her. Moran's personality becomes apparent in his dealings with his family, who all love and respect him despite his violent outbursts and his lack of apologies. His family are actually \\"inordinately grateful for the slightest good will.\\" Although he can be tender towards his family, he is often obstinate and cruel and demands constant attention. For example, on his wedding day he is content because \\"he needed this quality of attention to be fixed upon him in order to be completely silent.\\" He enforces his own view of the world on all those around him. He is a devout Catholic and makes sure that his family upholds all the values he fought for. He recites the Rosary daily, looking for religious help for his inner turmoil and the complications of his daily life. His violent nature stems from traumas he received as a guerrilla fighter in his youth. However, he thinks that the war was the best part of his life, because \\"things were never so simple and clear again.\\" He feels that he is losing his position as the centre of attention as he ages and the children start to escape from Great Meadow. He demands help and attention at inappropriate times as a way of focusing the others on his needs. Although he is mostly calm with his daughters, he is threatened by his sons as they grow up. Luke, the older son, leaves for London because of his father's overbearing authority and only returns once. Thoughts of Luke are painful to Moran, and the others refrain from mentioning him. Michael, the youngest child, hides behind Rose until he gains the courage to leave also. The only way that the children can assert any autonomy is through exile, thus tacitly rebuking Moran's ethos of family solidarity. Moran dominates his daughter's lives and they regularly return to the family home despite their own busy lives. They yearn for his approval, yet fear his temper. He tells them that it is important that the family stick together: \\"Alone we might be nothing. Together we can do anything.\\" They find individuality painful compared to the protection of the familial identity. Moran's friendship with McQuaid is also recounted using flashbacks, and there is an account of an attack carried out on the British Army by the Flying Column to which they belonged. There is also a description of the argument between them that ended their friendship and left Moran with no male friends. Moran dies at the end of the novel. He is buried under a yew tree, but his influence does not leave his family \\"...as they left him under the yew, it was as if each of them in their different ways had become Daddy.\\" Characters in Amongst Women *Michael Moran The central character in the novel and patriarch of the Moran family. He has five adult children and is married to Rose, his second wife. A \\"once powerful man,\\" he is an IRA veteran and a farmer. Although he is a devout and respected man, he is a domestic tyrant. He is bitter about the obsolescence of his body, authority, and the ideals he fought for, and vents his frustration on his family. A complex character, he is unpredictable, obsessed with appearances and lacking in any self-awareness. *Rose Moran (n√©e Brady) Moran's second wife and stepmother to his children. She is in middle-age when she marries Moran. She had previously worked in Glasgow, Scotland. Although Moran verbally abuses her, she remains loyal to him. She is quiet and patient. She is an integral part of the family and the children's mainstay. *Luke Moran Moran's eldest child. He is estranged from the family because of his father's violent treatment of him. He lives in London. He communicates with the family by telegram and is informed of his father's death by telegram, but he does not reply or come to the funeral. *Maggie Moran The eldest daughter. She left home to train as a nurse in England. She lives in London with her husband and children, but regularly returns to Great Meadow. *Mona Moran Lives in Dublin and works in the civil service. She also returns home frequently. *Sheila Moran Moran puts a stop to her chance at a university scholarship when she is a teenager. She gets a job in the civil service. She has a husband and children and lives in Dublin. *Michael Moran Moran's youngest child. He struggles to free himself from the family. When he is younger, he seeks refuge from his father's temper by hiding in the garden. He eventually resists his father and melodramatically leaves and moves to London. However, he does return home at times. He becomes a recognisable, although less severe, version of his father. *James McQuaid Moran's former lieutenant in the War of Independence, then a successful cattle dealer. He used to pay Moran an annual visit on Monaghan Day. He ends his friendship with Moran because of Moran's intransigent nature. *Annie & Lizzie Sisters who own and operate the post office Major themes The novel is written in quiet and restrained prose, a characteristic of McGahern's writing. The novel is not segmented into chapters. There is not a large amount of plot in the story, with most of the action taking place in flashbacks as the Morans remember the past. There are few dramatic highs and lows and events are paced at the normal tempo of life. All the small details of the Morans' lives gather together to give a powerful story of intergenerational relationships and the need to form connections to the past. The novel explores the mindset of post- colonial, traditional, Catholic, rural Ireland. Michael says \\"I'm afraid we might all die in Ireland if we don't get out fast.\\" McGahern asks whether exile offers the only hope for freedom and individuality in this society. A theme of the novel is the difficulty of communication between a father and his children, which questions Ireland's conceit of itself as a healthy family- centred society. It particularly exposes the insecurities and inexpressiveness of Irish masculinity.Schaffer, Brian W., 2004, A Companion to the British and Irish Novel 1945‚Äì2000. McGahern said of the novel: \\"The whole country is made up of families, each family a kind of independent republic. In Amongst Women, the family is a kind of half-way house between the individual and society.\\" Moran is a man capable of heroic action in a time of revolution, but he is incapable of meeting the demands of domestic and personal intimacy in his fraught and sometimes violent relationships with his wife and children. The question of how to maintain authority over children while still allowing them room to grow is central to the novel. The novel shows that Moran's contradictory behaviour is a personification of the contradictions of postcolonial society. He typifies the disappointment awaiting the revolutionary who aids the replacement of one power with another without reflecting on the process of domination itself. He vents his sense of betrayal on his family, allowing McGahern to explore how political turmoil can affect families. The story of the family is an allegory for that of independent Ireland ‚Äì without the father the family would not exist, but until Moran is dead, the family cannot become itself. The parallel is clearly with √âamon de Valera, though Moran is an Irish Republican legitimist, believing that the only legal government of Ireland was the First D√°il, and is deeply alienated from the Ireland of de Valera. Moran lives in a world where Ireland has both achieved nationhood and retreated from the world. Emigration is tolerated as a necessary evil, as it was in Ireland in the 1950s, but the economic failures that drove the mass exodus are never challenged. Moran's death is a moment of liberation for the family. As the main character, Moran, is never endearing, McGahern challenges the reader to empathise with him and to understand why the women in his life remain emotionally tied to him, even after they have successfully established independent lives away from Great Meadow. Moran's retreat from his youthful exploits in the IRA into a vice-like grip on his household can be seen as a political metaphor, described by one critic as a \\"A diminished form of home rule.\\" His home Great Meadow stands, like its owner, separate and proud from the landscape. For Moran, it is a domestic fortress where he can retreat from his failures in the outside world. Allusions/references to other works Amongst Women refashions characters, themes and situations from The Barracks and The Dark, McGahern's first two novels. For example, Moran resembles the character Mahoney in The Dark and Reegan, the bitter IRA veteran in The Barracks. McGahern's autobiography Memoir (2005) makes clear the influence of his early life on his work. His much-loved mother Susan died when he was a child, leaving McGahern and his siblings in the care of his father ‚Äì a former IRA member ‚Äì who was an authoritarian and self-absorbed Garda (policeman). His complicated character bears a large resemblance to Moran.McGahern, John, 2005, Memoir Literary significance & criticism Although McGahern had published four novels and three collections of short stories before Amongst Women, it was this novel that brought his first abundance of critical acclaim. This approval completely shifted the Irish public's reception of his work.

Syntax sd3=evalgraph('graph1',trajpar*100) Where sd3= A variable inside the variable section sweep that will be driven by a graph feature called 'graph1' Uses and notability trajpar can be used with various mathematical functions to create alternating, flaring, bowing or sinusoidal protrusions. It is primarily used in conjunction with the variable section sweep command in Creo Elements/Pro but can also remove material if desired. trajpar typifies what makes Creo Elements/Pro different from many other CAD software systems. The level of complexity and control given to the user is much greater than, for example other design or engineering software like SolidWorks or Alias Samples To create an undulating wave, a sinusoid might be desired: :d1=sin(trajpar \\\\cdot 8\\\\pi) A flare: :d1=1 + trajpar^2 etc., where d1 is the dimension to be controlled.

It is concerned with criminal justice and concentrates upon legal protection and assistance to victims of crime, particularly domestic violence. It also expands the provision for trials without a jury, brings in new rules for trials for causing the death of a child or vulnerable adult, and permits bailiffs to use force to enter homes. Origins The Act's provisions originated in several reports: * The Home Office White Paper Justice for All (Cm 5563) - many of whose recommendations were implemented in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 * The Home Office consultation paper Safety and Justice: the Government's Proposals on Domestic Violence (Cm 5847), published in June 2003 * The Home Office policy leaflet \\"A Better Deal for Victims and Witnesses\\", published on 21 November 2002 * National Society for the Protection of Children (\\"NSPCC\\") \\"Which of you did it?\\" Working Group Report, published in Autumn 2003 * The Law Commission report: Children: their non-accidental death or serious injury (criminal trials) (LC282), published on 16 September 2003 * The Law Commission consultative report Children: their non-accidental death or serious injury (criminal trials) - a consultative report (LC279), published on 15 April 2003 * The Law Commission report: [The Effective Prosecution of Multiple Offending] (LC277), published in October 2002 * The Law Commission report: Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals (LC267), published on the 6 March 2001 Reforms to police and court procedure =Non-molestation orders= Non- molestation orders under the Family Law Act 1996 were amended to provide a criminal sanction for non-compliance, with a maximum sentence of 5 years' imprisonment.The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, section 1 The circumstances in which such orders could be imposed was extended to include same-sex couples and cohabiting couples on an equal footing with married couples. Former cohabitants are also included. =Restraining orders= Restraining orders (preventing the recipient from doing anything specified in the order) can be imposed upon acquitted defendants.The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, section 12 They are imposed if the court \\"considers it necessary to do so to protect a person from harassment by the defendant\\". The Court of Appeal in allowing an appeal against conviction may also remit the matter to the Crown Court to consider a restraining order in respect of the otherwise successful appellant. =Common assault= The Act deemed common assault an arrestable offence.The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, section 10 The practical effect of this change was that the police could arrest a suspect at the scene without a warrant, rather than potentially be compelled to leave the suspected assailant with his or her alleged victim. Previously the police would have to allege assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which was arrestable, in order to detain the suspected assailant in borderline cases. However, the concept of \\"arrestable offence\\" was abolished on 1 January 2006. , police can effect an arrest, even in the case of suspected common assault, in order \\"to prevent the person in question causing physical injury to himself or any other person.\\"The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 24(5)(c)(i) The Act specified common assault as an alternative verdict to a count on an aggravated assault in the Crown Court, though it is not itself an indictable offence.s.11 =Fitness to plead= Judges, not a specially empanelled jury, now decide if a defendant is fit to plead.\\".The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, section 22 The regime for dealing with defendants who are unfit to plead or not guilty by reason of insanity (that is, committed the physical acts constituting the offence but without the sane intent) has also been modified. The court, not the Home Secretary, makes the assessment (requiring medical evidence to do so) whether the defendant should be committed to a psychiatric hospital. Trial by jury of sample counts only Trials with a substantial number of charges can now be split into two phases: trial by jury of \\"specimen counts\\" and judge-only trial of the remaining counts.The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, section 17 This further expands the circumstances in which trials can be heard without a jury (see the Criminal Justice Act 2003). The prosecution must satisfy the court that three conditions are met: * given the number of counts, a trial by jury involving all of them would be impracticable * each count or group of counts to be tried by a jury can be regarded as a sample of counts for judge-only trial * it is in the interests of justice The judge should take into account any ways that jury trial can be made easier, but no such measure should result in a trial where the defendant faces a lesser sentence than would be available with the new measures. Causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult =Previous difficulties with the law= An intractable legal problem had arisen in relation to cases where a child or vulnerable adult cared for by two people dies as a result of ill-treatment. It is known that at least one of two people is responsible, but not which. This problem had been analysed in a number of cases. The Court of Appeal in Lane v Lane(1986) 82 Cr App R 5 held that neither person could be convicted, nor the trial proceed past the end of the prosecution case, because there was no evidence specifically pointing to a certain defendant. Lord Goddard earlier commented in Regina v Abbott[1955] 2 QB 497 > \\"Probably one or other must have committed it, but there was not evidence > which, and although it is unfortunate that a guilty party cannot be brought > to justice, it is far more important that there should not be a miscarriage > of justice and that the law maintained that the prosecution should prove its > case.\\" The Law Commission's report commented that this meant one or other parent were potentially \\"getting away with murder\\".See Origins section, Law Commission report 282, paragraph 1.2 The Act deals with the problem in two ways: firstly by creating an offence of \\"causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult\\", and secondly by amending the rules of court procedure to require joint defendants to give their account of events in the witness box, effectively forcing them to incriminate the other if appropriate. =The new offence= The offence of \\"causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult\\", now referred to as the \\"new offence\\", is committed under section 5 of the ActThe Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, section 5 if the following four conditions apply: * A child or vulnerable adult dies as a result of an unlawful act of a person in the \\"same household\\" * The defendant was also member of the same household, with frequent contact with the victim, and present at the time of the unlawful act * There was a risk of serious physical harm to the victim at the time * Either: ** The defendant did the unlawful act (that is, directly caused the death), or ** Was aware of the risk (or ought to have been), didn't take reasonable steps to do anything about it, and foresaw the circumstances which led up to the unlawful act causing death Therefore if it can be established that a child or vulnerable adult died as a result of an unlawful act, it need not be proved which of the two responsible members of the household either caused the death or allowed it to happen. If there was no obvious history of violence, or any reason to suspect it, then the other members of the household would not be guilty of this offence, even in clear cases of homicide. Where there is no reason to suspect the victim is at risk, other members of the household cannot reasonably be expected to have taken steps to prevent the abuse. =New procedure= Court procedure is amended to restrict the circumstances in which the trial can be stopped at the end of the prosecution case and before the defence case. The ambit of the \\"adverse inference\\" (right of the jury to make assumptions about any part of the case, including the guilt of the defendant, based upon his or her failure to answer any question put in court)The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, section 35 is extended to include an inference on a joint charge of homicide (murder and manslaughter) and the new offence; this means that if a person is charged with either (or both) homicide offences and this new offence, then silence in the witness box can imply guilt of homicide as well as the new offence. This is subject to the usual safeguardThe Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, section 38(3); see also Murray v UK (1996) 22 EHRR 29, ECHR. that a person cannot be convicted solely upon the basis of their silence. The point at which a \\"no case to answer\\" submission (see definitionA submission that the prosecution have shown no, or fundamentally inadequate, evidence of the defendant's guilt on all elements of the offence; thus securing a judge-directed acquittal. This can occur at the end of the prosecution case before the defendant is under pressure to give evidence) can be made has in certain circumstances been moved to the end of the whole case, not just the prosecution. Joint charges of homicide and the new offence can only be dismissed at the end of the whole case (if the new offence has survived past that stage as well). The new offence will survive the \\"no case to answer\\" test as long as the fundamentals of the offence are demonstrated - the prosecution do not have to show whether the defendant caused or allowed the death to happen. The defendant will be under pressure to give evidence about what occurred - not to do so would result in the adverse inference being drawn. = Criticism = A number of issues have been pointed out by legal scholars with the current drafting. David Ormerod, writing in the criminal law textbook Smith and Hogan, notes that the Act deliberately does not define what counts as a \\"household\\". Additionally, the Act does not adequately cover some classes of carers who do not live in a household residence but have regular contact‚Äîdomestic nannies, for instance. The law also leaves unclear whether one carer is legally responsible for not taking steps to protect a vulnerable victim from the risky behaviour of another of his or her carers.Smith and Hogan, 12th edition, p.564-565 Bailiff powers The Act permits bailiffs to use force to enter homes, overturning a centuries-old doctrine, confirmed by Semayne's case (1604), that \\"an Englishman's home is his castle\\".The Guardian, 2 June 2009, The poorest need shielding from bailiffs This had been described in the eighteenth century by William Blackstone, who wrote in Book 4, Chapter 16Blackstone's Commentaries - Book the Fourth - Chapter the Sixteenth : Of Offenses Against the Habitations of Individuals of his Commentaries on the Laws of England: In 2009 charities providing advice to debtors said they were seeing bailiffs threatening to break in unless the debtor paid the full fine immediately, as well court and bailiff costs. Previously, charities had been able to advise debtors that bailiffs did not have the right to force entry, and the fine could be referred back to the courts and affordable payment schedules worked out.

CTC has been merged into WBTC since 2016.West Bengal Transport Corporation constituted ‚Äì CSTC, CTC and WBSTC merged in to WBTC  History  Life-size model of a horse-drawn tram at the City Centre arcade The first horse-drawn trams in India ran for between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street on 24 February 1873. The service was discontinued on 20 November of that year. The Calcutta Tramway Company was formed and registered in London on 22 December 1880. Metre-gauge horse-drawn tram tracks were laid from Sealdah to Armenian Ghat via Bowbazar Street, Dalhousie Square and Strand Road. The route was inaugurated by the Viceroy, Lord Ripon, on 1 November 1880. In 1882, steam locomotives were deployed experimentally to haul tram cars. A tram in 1945 In 1900, the electrification of the tramway and conversion of its tracks to (standard gauge) began. The first electric tramcar in Calcutta ran from Esplanade to Kidderpore on 27 March 1902. In February 1943, the Calcutta and Howrah sections were connected by the new Howrah Bridge. In 1951, the government of West Bengal entered an agreement with the Calcutta Tramways Company and the Calcutta Tramways Act of 1951 was enacted. The government assumed the tramways, reserving the right to purchase the system with two years' notice on 1 January 1972 or at any time thereafter. In 1967, the Government of West Bengal passed the Calcutta Tramways Company (Taking Over of Management) Act and assumed management on 19 July. On 8 November 1976, the Calcutta Tramways (Acquisition of Undertaking) ordinance was promulgated under which the company (and its assets) was nationalised. The Tramways system had degraded by the 1990s, and Minister for Transport Shyamal Chakraborty planned to close the network. In the meantime, Calcutta Tramways Company introduced bus service on 4 November 1992 with a fleet of 40 buses. However, Melbourne tram conductor Roberto D'Andrea befriended fellow Calcutta conductors during a 1994 visit. When D'Andrea heard about the planned closure of tram network, he suggested an art project to decorate the trams (as was done in his home city). The project increased public awareness of the tram network and its value, ultimately saving it.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-06/tramjatra-melbourne-and-kolkata- linked-by-tram-history/7904626 Trams The Calcutta Tramways Company Ltd operates the Kolkata tram, currently the oldest electric tramway in Asia and India's only existent tram system, since 1880. Buses With over 45 routes throughout Kolkata and its surrounding areas, CTC buses complement its tram service. The initial bus service was introduced from Rajabazar with a fleet of 40 buses, augmented in 1993 with service from Kidderpore depot. The Tollygunge and Belgachia depots were added in 1994 and 1995, respectively. In 2005 the CTC began bus service from Ghasbagan depot at Howrah. Depots, terminals and workshops There are five tram depots: Rajabazar, Gariahat, Tollygunge, Kalighat and Khidirpur. Rajabazar and Tollygunge depots are the largest in terms of tracks and area, respectively. Khidirpur depot is the oldest and Kalighat depot is the smallest. There were tram depots at Ghasbagan, Belgachhia, Park Circus and Joka which are now converted into CTC bus depots. There are also CTC bus depots in Barasat, Habra and Titagarh. There are six tram terminals: Shyambazar, Bidhan Nagar Road, Ballygunge Station, Esplanade, B.B.D. Bagh (currently closed, work going on resume its services again) and Howrah Bridge. The Esplanade terminus serves most of the tram routes. Former tram terminals, all now either closed or converted into bus depots and terminals, had been at Shibpur, Bandhaghat, Bagbazar, Galiff Street, Kolkata High Court, Nimtala, Behala, Sealdah Station, Howrah Station, Planetarium and Racecourse. There is one workshop: Nonapukur.  Routes  6 routes currently operate in Kolkata. Recently AC tram was also introduced.

Hair on top of the scalp is grown long and is often braided, while the front portion of the head is shaved. The distinctive hairstyle led to it being targeted during anti-Chinese riots in Australia and the United States.https://www.theworldofchinese.com/2019/07/hairy-history/ The requirement that Han Chinese men and others under Manchu rule give up their traditional hairstyles and wear the queue was met with resistance, although opinions about the queue did change over time. Han women, however, were never required to wear their hair in the traditional women's Manchu style, Liangbatou, although this, too, like the queue, was a symbol of Manchu identity.  Predecessors and origin  The Xianbei and Wuhuan were said to shave their heads while Xiongnu had queues. Other evidence from Chinese histories indicate that the Xianbei Tuoba wore braids since they were called braided by southern Chinese however their hairstyle is hidden in depictions due to a hood they wore. Among the records of the southern Chinese dynasties the Liu Song's history called them \\"braided caitiff\\" (suo-lu) while the Southern Qi's history said they wore their \\"hair hanging down the back\\" (pifa) and called them suo-tou (braided). A braid of hair was found in Zhalairuoer in a Tuoba grave. Han Chinese also made barbarians undo their queues when conquering them. To show submission to the Han Chinese in the Sui dynasty the people of Turfan (Gaochang) undid their queues and so did Turks who surrendered to the Tang dynasty which was the reverse of what happened in northern China when some Han and Inner Asians like Xianbei wore braids (bianfa) and the northerners were called suotou (pigtail heads) by southerners during the Northern and Southern dynasties. Hairstyles showed affiliation to a tribal confederation or dynasty. Xianbei people among foreigners are depicted on paintings with their rear heads showing a small queue in the Western Wei cave 285 at the Dunhuang Mogao caves. The queue was far older than Manchus. The Chinese word for queue, bian meant plainted hair or a cord. The Chinese word bian was used to describe the braid in the Manchu queue hairstyle was originally applied by the Han dynasty to the Xiongnu. Jurchens wore a queue like Manchu, Khitan wore the \\"Tartar style\\" and during the Tang dynasty tribes in the west wore braids. The Tanguts of the Western Xia may have inherited hairstyle influences from the Tuoba (Tabgach) Xianbei. It resembled a monk's hairstyle but was not exactly like their tonsure, it left the face to be framed on the sides and forehead by a fringe of hair by shaving the head top and leaving it bald. This made sure the Tibetans and Song Chinese could be told apart from shaved Tanguts. It was imposed by order on Tanguts by their own emperor Yuanhao Weiming on pain of death threatening that their throats would be cut if they did not shave within three days. The emperor was the first one to shave. Unlike the tonsure of the Tangut Western Xia, the Jurchen hairstyle of wearing the queue combined with shaving the crown was not the invention of an emperor of the dynasty but was an established Jurchen hairstyle which showed who submitted to Jin rule. This Jurchen queue and shaving hairstyle was not enforced on the Han Chinese in the Jin after an initial attempt to do so which was a rebuke to Jurchen values. The Jin at first attempted to impose Jurchen hairstyle and clothes on the Han population in the Jin but the order was taken back. They also banned intermarriage. Khitan man in tomb painting in Aohan Banner, Inner Mongolia Manchu Jurchen men had queues, while Mongol men swept their hair behind their ears and plaited them, Turk men wore loose hair and Xiongnu men braided their hair. Khitan males grew hair from their temples but shaved the crown of their heads. The Han Chinese men living in the Liao dynasty were not required to wear the shaved Khitan hairstyle which Khitan men wore to distinguish their ethnicity, unlike the Qing dynasty which mandated wearing of the Manchu hairstyle for men. Khitan men left only two separate patches of hair on each of the forehead's sides in front of each ear in tresses while they shaved the top of their head. Khitan wore felt hats, fur clothes and woolen cloth and the Liao emperor switched between Han and Khitan clothing. Khitan officials used gold ornamented ribbons to found their hair locks around their foreheads, covering their heads with felt hats according to the Ye Longli's (Yeh Lung-li) Qidan Guozhi (Ch'i-tan kuo-chih). Khitan wore the long side fringes and shaved pates. Tomb murals of Khitan hairstyle show only some hair remaining near the neck and forehead with the rest of the head shaved. Only at the temples were hair left while the crown was shaven. The absence of Khitan clothes and hairstyles on a painting of riders previously identified as Khitan has lead to experts questioning their purported identity. Khitan men might have differentiate between classes by wearing different patterns on their small braids hanging off their shaved foreheads. They wore the braids occasionally with a forehead fringe with some shaving off all the forehead. Some Han men adopted and mixed or combined Han clothing with Khitan clothing with Khitan boots and Han clothes or wearing Khitan clothes. Han women on the other hand did not adopt Khitan dress and continued wearing Han dress.

The queue was a specifically male hairstyle worn by the Manchu from central Manchuria and later imposed on the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty.Jia Sheng (), ÂÆãÈáëÊó∂‰ª£ÁöÑ‚ÄúÁïôÂèë‰∏çÁïôÂ§¥‚Äù (\\"Keep the hair, lose the head\\" in the Song-Jin era)Zi Yunju (Á¥´Èõ≤Â±Ö), (Hair, nails, and magic of China) The hair on the front of the head was shaved off above the temples every ten days and the remainder of the hair was braided into a long braid.Li Ziming (ÊùéÂ≠êÊòé), (Barber's tale: notes from the life of Chinese abroad in the late Qing era) The Manchu hairstyle was forcefully introduced to Han Chinese in the early 17th century during the Manchu conquest of China. Nurhaci of the Aisin Gioro clan declared the establishment of the Later Jin dynasty, later becoming the Qing dynasty of China, after Ming dynasty forces in Liaodong defected to his side. The Ming general of Fushun, Li Yongfang, defected to Nurhaci after Nurhaci promised him rewards, titles, and Nurhaci's own granddaughter in marriage. Other Han Chinese generals in Liaodong proceeded to defect with their armies to Nurhaci and were given women from the Aisin Gioro family in marriage. Once firmly in power, Nurhaci commanded all men in the areas he conquered to adopt the Manchu hairstyle. The Manchu hairstyle signified Han submission to Qing rule, and also aided the Manchu identification of those Han who refused to accept Qing dynasty domination. The hairstyle was compulsory for all males and the penalty for non-compliance was execution for treason. In the early 1910s, after the fall of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese no longer had to wear the Manchu queue. While some, such as Zhang Xun, still did so as a tradition, most of them abandoned it after the last Emperor of China, Puyi, cut his queue in 1922.Lao Lu (), (Thoroughly changing the customs officially established for 200 years: the story of queue-cutting in the early Republic of China period) The Nanais at first fought against the Nurhaci and the Manchus, led by their own Nanai Hurka chief Sosoku before surrendering to Hongtaiji in 1631. Mandatory shaving of the front of all male heads was imposed on Amur peoples like the Nanai people who were conquered by the Qing. The Amur peoples already wore the queue on the back of their heads but did not shave the front until the Qing subjected them and ordered them to shave.  Queue order  Chinese circus performers soon after the Manchu conquest, wearing queues. (Drawing by Johan Nieuhof, 1655‚Äì57) The Queue Order (), or tonsure decree, was a series of laws violently imposed by the Qing (Manchu) dynasty in the seventeenth century. It was also imposed on Taiwanese aborigines in 1753,Ê∏ÖÊúù‰πæÈöÜ23Âπ¥Ê∏ÖÊîøÂ∫ú‰ª§Âπ≥ÂüîÊóè‰∫∫Â≠∏Ê∏Ö‰øó Ê∏ÖÊúù‰πãÂâÉÈ´ÆÁµêËæÆ and Koreans who settled in northeast China in the late 19th century, though the Ryukyuan people, whose kingdom was a tributary of China, requested and were granted an exemption from the mandate. Traditionally, adult Han Chinese did not cut their hair for philosophical and cultural reasons. According to the Classic of Filial Piety, Confucius said As a result of this ideology, both men and women wound their hair into a bun (a topknot) or other various hairstyles. Han Chinese did not object to wearing the queue braid on the back of the head as they traditionally wore all their hair long, but fiercely objected to shaving the forehead so the Qing government exclusively focused on forcing people to shave the forehead rather than wear the braid. Han rebels in the first half of the Qing who objected to Qing hairstyle wore the braid but defied orders to shave the front of the head. One person was executed for refusing to shave the front but he had willingly braided the back of his hair. It was only later westernized revolutionaries, influenced by western hairstyle who began to view the braid as backward and advocated adopting short haired western hairstyles. Han rebels against the Qing like the Taiping even retained their queue braids on the back but the symbol of their rebellion against the Qing was the growing of hair on the front of the head, causing the Qing government to view shaving the front of the head as the primary sign of loyalty to the Qing rather than wearing the braid on the back which did not violate Han customs and which traditional Han did not object to. Koxinga insulted and criticized the Qing hairstyle by referring to the shaven pate looking like a fly. Koxinga and his men objected to shaving when the Qing demanded they shave in exchange for recognizing Koxinga as a feudatory. The Qing demanded that Zheng Jing and his men on Taiwan shave in order to receive recognition as a fiefdom. His men and Ming prince Zhu Shugui fiercely objected to shaving. A soldier during the Boxer Rebellion with queue and conical Asian hat In 1644, Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, a minor Ming dynasty official turned leader of a peasant revolt. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell, marking the official end of the Ming dynasty. The Han Chinese Ming general Wu Sangui and his army then defected to the Qing and allowed them through Shanhai pass. They then seized control of Beijing, overthrowing Li's short-lived Shun dynasty. They then forced Han Chinese to adopt the queue as a sign of submission. A year later, after the Qing armies reached South China, on July 21, 1645, the-regent Dorgon issued an edict ordering all Han men to shave their foreheads and braid the rest of their hair into a queue identical to those worn by the Manchus.; ; which calls this edict \\"the most untimely promulgation of [Dorgon's] career.\\" The Han Chinese were given 10 days to comply or face death. Although Dorgon admitted that followers of Confucianism might have grounds for objection, most Han officials cited the Ming dynasty's traditional System of Rites and Music as their reason for resistance. This led Dorgon to question their motives: \\"If officials say that people should not respect our Rites and Music, but rather follow those of the Ming, what can be their true intentions?\\" In the queue order edict, Dorgon specifically emphasized the fact that Manchus and the Qing emperor himself all wore the queue and shaved their foreheads so that by following the queue order and shaving, Han Chinese would look like Manchus and the Qing Emperor and invoked the Confucian notion that the people were like the sons of the emperor who was like the father, so the father and sons could not look different and to decrease differences in physical appearance between Manchu and Han Chinese. The slogan adopted by the Qing was \\"Cut the hair and keep the head, (or) keep the hair and cut the head\\" (). People resisted the order and the Qing struck back with deadly force, massacring all who refused to obey. Han rebels in Shandong tortured to death the Qing official who suggested the queue order to Dorgon, and killed his relatives.Á†îÂ†ÇË¶ãËÅûÈõúË®ò The imposition of this order was not uniform; it took up to 10 years of martial enforcement for all of China to be brought into compliance, and while it was the Qing who imposed the queue hairstyle on the general population, they did not always personally execute those who did not obey. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but defected to the Qing, ordered troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. The third massacre left few survivors. The three massacres at Jiading District are some of the most infamous, with estimated death tolls in the tens or even hundreds of thousands. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on October 9, 1645, the Qing army, led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (ÂäâËâØ‰Ωê), who had been ordered to \\"fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords,\\" massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people.. Han Chinese soldiers in 1645 under Han General Hong Chengchou forced the queue on the people of Jiangnan while Han people were initially paid silver to wear the queue in Fuzhou when it was first implemented. The queue was the only aspect of Manchu culture that the Qing forced on the common Han population. The Qing required people serving as officials to wear Manchu clothing but allowed other Han civilians to continue wearing Hanfu (Han clothing) but most Han civilian men voluntarily adopted Manchu clothingTwitchett, Denis; Fairbank, John K. (2008) Cambridge History of China Volume 9 Part 1 The Ch'ing Empire to 1800, p87-88 like Changshan on their own free will.

Since the Qing dynasty grouped Muslims by language, the Han Hui (currently known as Hui people) were classified as Han Chinese, so they were required to wear the queue. Turkic Muslims, like the Uyghur and Salar people, were not required to wear the queue.Morris Rossabi (2005). Governing China's Multiethnic Frontiers. University of Washington Press. . p. 22 During the Qing Salar men shaved their hair bald while when they went to journey in public they put on artificial queues. Uyghur men shaved their hair bald during the Qing. However, after Jahangir Khoja invaded Kashgar, Turkistani Muslim begs and officials in Xinjiang eagerly fought for the \\"privilege\\" of wearing a queue to show their steadfast loyalty to the Empire. High-ranking begs were granted this right. The purpose of the Queue Order was to demonstrate loyalty to the Qing and, conversely, growing one's hair came to symbolize revolutionary ideals, such as during the White Lotus Rebellion. The members of the Taiping Rebellion were called the Long hairs () or Hair rebels ().  Resistance to the queue  Han Chinese resistance to adopting the queue was widespread and bloody. The Chinese in the Liaodong Peninsula rebelled in 1622 and 1625 in response to the implementation of the mandatory hairstyle. The Manchus responded swiftly by killing the educated elite and instituting a stricter separation between Han Chinese and Manchus. In 1645, the enforcement of the queue order was taken a step further by the ruling Manchus when it was decreed that any man who did not adopt the Manchu hairstyle within ten days would be executed. The intellectual Lu Xun summed up the Chinese reaction to the implementation of the mandatory Manchu hairstyle by stating, \\"In fact, the Chinese people in those days revolted not because the country was on the verge of ruin, but because they had to wear queues.\\" In 1683 Zheng Keshuang surrendered and wore a queue. The queue became a symbol of the Qing dynasty and a custom except among Buddhist monastics.È†≠ÂèØÊñ∑ËæÆÂ≠ê‰∏çÂèØÂâ™ Ê∏ÖÊúùÁïôÂ≠∏ÁîüÂâ™ËæÆ=ÂÅ∑‰∫ÜÊÉÖ Some revolutionists, supporters of the Hundred Days' Reform or students who studied abroad cut their braids. The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 led to a complete change in hairstyle almost overnight. The queue became unpopular as it became associated with a fallen government; this is depicted in Lu Xun's short story Storm in a Teacup in which Chinese citizens in Hong Kong collectively changed to short haircuts.Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished & reduced 2003). Old Hong Kong ‚Äì Volume One. Central, Hong Kong: Text Form Asia books Ltd. ISBN Volume One 962-7283-59-2 Many people were violating the Qing laws on hair at the end of the dynasty. Some Chinese chose to wear the queue but not to shave their crown, while those people who cut the queue off and did not shave were considered revolutionary and others maintained the state mandated combination of the queue and shaved crown.  Exemptions  Neither Taoist priests nor Buddhist monks were required to wear the queue by the Qing; they continued to wear their traditional hairstyles, completely shaved heads for Buddhist monks, and long hair in the traditional Chinese topknot for Taoist priests.  Foreign reaction  Barbershop in the Qing Dynasty (1870s) The Manchus' willingness to impose the queue and their dress style on the men of China was viewed as an example to emulate by some foreign observers. H. E. M. James, a British civil servant in India, wrote in 1887 that the British ought to act in a similarly decisive way when imposing their will in India. In his view, the British administration should have outlawed practises such as Sati much earlier than 1829, which James ascribed to a British unwillingness to challenge long-held Indian traditions, no matter how detrimental they were to the country. British author Demetrius Charles Boulger in 1899 proposed that Britain form and head an alliance of \\"Philo-Chinese Powers\\" in setting up a new government for China based in Shanghai and Nanking as two capitals along the River Yangtze, to counter the interests of other powers in the region like the Russians due to what he believed was the imminent collapse of the Qing dynasty. The Yangtze valley was controlled by Qing officials such as Liu Kunyi and Zhang Zhidong, who were not under Beijing's influence and whom Boulger believed Britain could work with to stabilize China. He proposed that at Nanjing and Hankou a force of Chinese soldiers trained by the British be deployed and in Hong Kong, Weihaiwei and the Yangtze valley and it would have no allegiance to the Qing, and as such they in his idea would forgo the queue and be made to grow their hair long as a symbolic measure to \\"increasing the confidence of the Chinese in the advent of a new era\\". Boulger stated he could not discern from the Chinese he spoke to on whether the queue was invented by Nurhaci to impose on the Chinese as a symbol of loyalty or whether it was an already established Manchu custom as no one seemed to know the origin of it from his or other sinologists' inquiries. English adventurer Augustus Frederick Lindley wrote that the beardless, youthful long haired Han Chinese rebels from Hunan in the Taiping armies who grew all their hair long while fighting against the Qing dynasty were among the most beautiful men in the world unlike, in his mind, the Han Chinese who wore the queue, with Lindley calling the shaved part \\"a disfigurement\\".  Similar laws in Japan  A 19th-century samurai with a chonmage A Japanese barbershop in the 19th century In the Edo period of Tokugawa Shogunate Japan orders were passed for Japanese men to shave the pate on the front of their head (the chonmage hairstyle) and shave their beards, facial hair and side whiskers. This was similar to the Qing dynasty queue order imposed by Dorgon making men shave the pates on the front of their heads. Vietnam After Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá defeated the Later L√™ dynasty, high ranking L√™ loyalists and the last L√™ emperor L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng fled Vietnam for asylum in Qing China. They went to Beijing where L√™ Chi√™u Th·ªëng was appointed a Chinese mandarin of the fourth rank in the Han Yellow Bordered Banner, while lower ranking loyalists were sent to cultivate government land and join the Green Standard Army in Sichuan and Zhejiang. They adopted Qing clothing and adopt the queue hairstyle, effectively becoming naturalized subjects of the Qing dynasty affording them protection against Vietnamese demands for extradition. Some L√™ loyalists were also sent to Central Asia in Urumqi.Annam and its Minor Currency, chapter 16. Modern descendants of the L√™ monarch can be traced to southern Vietnam and Urumqi, Xinjiang. = Other queues = Curley Bear with queued hair. * The queue is also a Native American hairstyle, as described in the book House Made of Dawn by N. Scott Momaday. * British soldiers and sailors during the 18th century wore their hair in a style known as the queue. While not always braided, the hair was similarly pulled back very tight into a single tail, wrapped around a piece of leather and tied down with a ribbon. The hair was also often greased and powdered in a fashion similar to powdered wigs, or tarred in the case of sailors. It was said that the soldiers' hair was pulled back so tightly that they had difficulty closing their eyes afterwards. The use of white hair powder in the British Army was discontinued in 1796 and queues were ordered to be cut off four years later.Stocqueler, Joachim Hayward (1871) A Familiar History of the British Army, from the Restoration in 1660 to the Present Time, Edward Stanford, London (pp. 103-104) They continued to be worn in the Royal Navy for a while longer, where they were known as \\"pigtails\\". Officers wore pigtails until 1805 and other ranks continued to wear them until about 1820.Wilkinson-Latham, Robert (1977) The Royal Navy, 1790‚Äì1970 Osprey Publishing, (p. 34) * Painting of the Battle of Leuthen with the Prussian soldiers wearing the soldier's queue In the 18th century, European soldiers styled their traditionally long hair into a queue called the \\"soldier's queue\\" (Soldatenzopf), which was previously only allowed for noble officers. That hairstyle first became mandatory in the Prussian Army and those of several other states within the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick William I of Prussia. An artificial or \\"patent\\" queue was issued to recruits whose hair was too short to plait. The style was abolished in the Prussian army in 1807.Hudson, Elizabeth Harriot (1878), (The Life And Times of Louisa, Queen of Prussia With an Introductory Sketch of Prussian History: Volume II reprinted by Adamant Media Corporation (September 13, 2001) (pp. 214-215)  See also  * Braid * Cheongsam * Chupryna * Foot binding * Hanfu * Pigtail * Pigtail Ordinance * Rattail (haircut) * Sikha * Culture_of_Vietnam#Hairstyle_and_teeth_blackening * Beard and haircut laws by country  References  Works cited  Nguy·ªÖn Kh·∫Øc Thu·∫ßn (2005), Danh t∆∞·ªõng Vi·ªát Nam, Nh√† Xu·∫•t b·∫£n Gi√°o d·ª•c.

It has been the first known standardized photometric system. The letters U, B, and V stand for ultraviolet, blue, and visual magnitudes, which are measured for a star; two subtractions are then performed in a specific order to classify it in the system. The choice of colors on the blue end of the spectrum is because of the bias that photographic film has for those colors. It was introduced in the 1950s by American astronomers Harold Lester Johnson and William Wilson Morgan. A telescope and the telescope at McDonald Observatory were used to define the system. The filters are selected so that the mean wavelengths of response functions (at which magnitudes are measured to mean precision) are 364 nm for U, 442 nm for B, 540 nm for V. Zero points were calibrated in the B‚àíV (B minus V) and U‚àíB (U minus B) color indices selecting such A0 main sequence stars which are not affected by interstellar reddening. These stars correspond with a mean effective temperature (Teff (K)) of between 9727 and 9790 Kelvin, the latter being stars with class A0V. The UBV system has some disadvantages. The short wavelength cutoff that is the U filter is defined mainly by the terrestrial atmosphere rather than the filter itself; thus, it (and observed magnitudes) can vary with altitude and atmospheric conditions. However, many measurements have been made in this system, including many of the bright stars.Iriarte, Braulio, Johnson, Harold L., Mitchell, Richard I., and Wisniewski, Wieslaw K.

The building in the south-western corner of Merton College is also called Grove. The name perhaps has been derived from this area having been used as an orchard.

In the 17th century, it was named Magpie Lane because of an alehouse in the lane that used a magpie as a sign. By the late 19th century, the lane was known as Grove Street but in 1927 the name was changed back to Magpie Lane.

Located in King City, Ontario, north of Toronto, the success of the stable would see it expand to the United States with the acquisition of a farm and training center near Ocala, Florida. Kinghaven became a father/son operation in 1974 when Bud's son David S. Willmot began managing the farm's racing/breeding programs. In 2004, Willmot announced that Kinghaven was shutting down its Thoroughbred operation, although he would continue to race a handful of horses in following years. History Kinghaven Farms Limited is a thoroughbred breeding and racing farm founded in 1967 by Donald G. \\"Bud\\" Willmot. Located in King City, Ontario, Kinghaven became a father/son operation in 1974 when Bud's son and current President David S. Willmot began managing the farm's racing/breeding programs. One of the most decorated racing stables in Canadian history, Kinghaven won Canada's most prestigious horse race, the Queen's Plate, on five occasions. John J. Tammaro, Jr. was head trainer from 1976 to 1985. He conditioned five Canadian Champions for Kinghaven, including the 1979 Queen's Plate winner Steady Growth and U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt, Deputy Minister. Trainer Roger Attfield succeeded Tammaro as trainer in 1985. En route to being inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame, Attfield won numerous prestigious races for Kinghaven including four editions of the Queen's Plate and trained many Champions. Since inception, Kinghaven Farms has bred or raced more than 150 stakes race winners, including back-to-back Canadian Triple Crown champions With Approval and Izvestia in 1989 and 1990. At its peak, Kinghaven Farms had 200 horses, including nearly 80 broodmares, and owned syndicate shares in close to two dozen top stallions standing at Kentucky stud farms.. It operated four farms, two in King City, Ontario, one in Ocala, Florida and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Throughout this entire period, Ian Black served as Farm Manager and was a crucial element in Kinghaven's success. Bud Willmot was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1991. David Willmot was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005. Following Bud's death in 1994, David assumed sole ownership. Kinghaven continued to produce champions and stakes winners until 2011 but during this time the farm's operations were scaled back significantly due to David's management responsibilities at Ontario Jockey Club / Woodbine Entertainment Group. He was President and CEO from 1995 to 2010 and was Chairman from 2001 to 2012. During his tenure, Woodbine Entertainment Group invested approximately $400 million in upgrading its facilities and technology and paid over $2 billion dollars in purse money. To this day, Kinghaven Farms remains a family run business. With David's wife Susan, and son Jay, serving as Vice Presidents, the farm has begun expanding its business into multiple areas including renewable energy and apiculture. Kinghaven maintains its roots in the equine industry through standardbred breeding and ownership, where it has owned, in partnership, champions Southwind Allaire, Cabrini Hanover and Solar Sister. Notable Horses Notable horses owned or bred by Kinghaven include: * Steady Growth - 1979 Queen's Plate winner * Deputy Minister - 1981 Canadian Horse of the Year, champion 2-year-old in both Canada and the United States * Summer Mood, champion sprinter of 1985 * Carotene, winner of six Sovereign Awards from 1986 to 1988 * Market Control - 1987 Queen's Plate winner * Play the King - 1988 Canadian Horse of the Year * With Approval, 1989 Canadian Horse of the Year and Triple Crown winner * Izvestia - 1990 Canadian Horse of the Year and Triple Crown winner * Alydeed - 1992 Queen's Plate winner, second in the Preadness Stakes * Alywow - 1994 Canadian Horse of the Year Employee fraud at Kinghaven Farms On February 20, 2007 Kinghaven Farms' bookkeeper, Christiane Krohn, turned herself in to police to face fraud-related charges stemming from allegations that she stole more than $500,000 from the organization over a period of 7 years.

The month before his death, Hron had won a bronze medal in the national canoeing youth championships. Murder Hron had been camping with a friend by the small lake Ingetorpssj√∂n near his home town Kode in Kung√§lv Municipality on the night of his murder. Four young men (15-year-old Mikael Fj√§llholm and 18-year- old Daniel Hansson, plus a 17-year-old and another 18-year-old) appeared, who all had strong ties to the neo-Nazi skinhead subculture and especially the militant Nazi network Vitt Ariskt Motst√•nd. Hron knew the youngest, Mikael Fj√§llholm, from school. Mikael, who had been a bully at the school both he and Hron attended, said in his testimony, \\"I must have scared every last one in that school.\\" Hron, who was known for speaking his mind, had come in conflict with Mikael and the neo-Nazi gang earlier, and they had threatened to kill him. On the evening of 17 August 1995, while Hron was camping with his friend Christian at a cliff at lake Ingetorpssj√∂n, the group of neo-Nazis walked up to their campsite, dressed in nazi clothing and playing loud White Power music from a stereo. First, Daniel Hansson threw a can of beer in Hron's face and told him to say that he \\"loves Nazism\\", punching him several times in the face, while the others laughed. Hron, being known for standing up against racism, refused to say this and was again beaten brutally for it. The four began kicking him in the head, hitting him, throwing heavy cans of beer in his face, and taunting him verbally. They would intersperse their beatings with suddenly acting friendly, offering him beers, and apologizing, just to continue beating him again, in what was described as a sadistic \\"cat-and- mouse\\"-like torture that went on for hours. They jump-kicked him, kicked him in the back of his head, struck his neck with a flaming piece of wood and burnt him, stomped on his stomach, destroyed his belongings and set fire to the tent he had shared with Christian. Hron and Christian begged several times for the neo-Nazis to let them go home, but this simply angered the attackers who continued hitting Hron until he could no longer stand. Hron was eventually pushed into the lake, still alive. He tried to swim away and two of the four attackers walked around to the other side of the lake to catch him if he were to swim across. Around this time the murderers also shouted to Hron to swim back, threatening to kill Christian if he did not, and Hron decided to swim back to save his friend's life. Christian was forced to shout to Hron \\"come back or they will kill me\\". The torture continued as two of the most active attackers, Daniel and Mikael, got John up from the lake, and after knocking him down again they placed his body in a position so that they could continue kicking and stomping him in the head for several minutes with their boots. They later said about this part: \\"It felt so good that we couldn't stop\\". After Hron became unconscious, they rolled his fractured body into the water again. He sunk to the bottom and drowned, although medics said that even if he had not been dumped in the lake it is most unlikely he would have survived the damages to his body and head from the beating. Christian hitched a ride home and alerted the authorities. The two murderers still on the scene rolled a cigarette as they watched Hron's body sink to the bottom of the lake, later jokingly bragging about it to the other two attackers. Aftermath, public outcry and prosecution In court, the 18-year-old boy who was the main person behind the abuse, Daniel Hansson, was sentenced to eight years in prison for murder. He was released on 1 January 2001. Mikael Fj√§llholm, the 15-year-old, was sentenced to prison (which in Sweden is a rare thing to happen to a convicted teenager). The two others, John Billing and one more known only as BM were sentenced to ten and four months in prison for assault and not alerting authorities to the ongoing assault and murder, respectively. The case received nationwide attention within Sweden. The public was shocked by the news of such violence and a wave of huge anti-racist manifestations took place to honour Hron's memory. In 1996, Hron posthumously received the inaugural Stig Dagerman Prize for free speech and world peace. Hron's grave has since been desecrated several times by neo-Nazis. Murderer Daniel Hansson had previously stabbed a man in an earlier crime as a juvenile offender and was a teenage alcoholic, and at least two of the young murderers were suspected of having severe untreated mental instability and violent behaviour in their childhoods. Another one of the gang was part of a plot to violently attack a sports event. All of them were active neo-Nazis, some of them involved in the violent organization Vitt Ariskt Motst√•nd (VAM), which translates to \\"White Aryan Resistance.\\" Racist flyers and propaganda were found in their homes. During the murder they wore t-shirts with Adolf Hitler and other nazi prints on and bomber jackets. In prison one of them was part in forming the criminal prison gang \\"Ariska Br√∂draskapet\\" (a Swedish version of the \\"Aryan Brotherhood\\" but no ties or connections to the US gang has been made officially except inspiration). Mikael Fj√§llholm was later stabbed in the eye with a screwdriver during his prison sentence by another nazi, damaging him for life. Daniel Hansson was sentenced after his release for more crimes, including abusing and beating his then-girlfriend. All of them came from broken homes and dysfunctional families.

He was renowned as a highly learned Hebrew scholar, author, translator, leader and erudite speaker. Biography Rabbi Hyamson was born in Suvalk, Russia (now Poland); he emigrated to England in 1864. He was educated in Talmud by his father, Rabbi Nathan Haimsohn, and by Dayan Jacob Reinowitz of the London Beth Din. He married Sara Gordon at the Great Synagogue in London in 1892. Rabbi Hyamson was ordained as Rabbi by Rabbi Hermann Adler through Jews' College, London. He also received several degrees from University College London. He received a Bachelor of Arts in 1882, a Bachelor of Laws in 1900, and a Doctor of Laws in 1912. Rabbi Hyamson served as a Rabbi in Swansea, Bristol and Dalston, becoming a dayan of the London Beth Din. He was one of the eulogizers at the funeral of Rabbi Eliezer Gordon in 1910. He was the rival candidate of Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz for the permanent post of Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, to which the latter was appointed. In 1913, Rabbi Hyamson was elected Rabbi of Congregation Orach Chaim in New York. He received a life contract and served his community until his death in 1949. His distinguished leadership contributed significantly to Jewish life in America and overseas. (Serendipitously, at Orach Chaim, Hyamson replaced Hertz, to whom he had lost the British appointment.) Rabbi Hyamson founded the Board of Milah in New York in 1914, which grew to encompass Mohel certification, conferences on circumcision, and published studies. He was also an early leader of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. He helped in the founding of a local Hebrew school and the formation of the Central Relief Committee of the Agudas HaRabbanim, which provided European yeshivas with much needed assistance. The committee was the first of three organisations which developed into the Joint Distribution Committee. Rabbi Hyamson led the battle to preserve shechita in America. He was president and a leading founder of \\"The League for Safeguarding the Fixity of the Sabbath\\". He helped prevent the legislation of Calendar Reform, which on an international level would have created a \\"wandering\\" Sabbath, changing to a different day of the week each year. Rabbi Hyamson met with President Herbert Hoover, and addressed Congress and the League of Nations. Notwithstanding his formidably Orthodox credentials, Rabbi Hyamson was appointed Professor Emeritus of Codes at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1915, serving until 1940. The divide at that time between Orthodox Judaism and the traditional wings of Conservative Judaism was not vast. Rabbi Hyamson translated Duties of the Heart, Books I (and II posthumously) of Maimonides's Mishneh Torah, and \\"Collatio Mosaicarum et Romanarum Legum\\". He authored \\"The Oral Law\\" and numerous other writings on Jewish issues of the day.

It was originally created to be a relapse-prevention treatment for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). A focus on MDD and cognitive processes distinguishes MBCT from other mindfulness-based therapies. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), for example, is a more generalized program that also utilizes the practice of mindfulness. MBSR is a group-intervention program, like MBCT, that uses mindfulness to help improve the life of individuals with chronic clinical ailments and high-stress lives. CBT-inspired methods are used in MBCT, such as educating the participant about depression and the role that cognition plays within it. MBCT takes practices from CBT and applies aspects of mindfulness to the approach. One example would be \\"decentering\\", a focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them. This process aims to aid an individual in disengaging from self-criticism, rumination, and dysphoric moods that can arise when reacting to negative thinking patterns. Like CBT, MBCT functions on the etiological theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. Like MBSR, this mindfulness practice encourages the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. With regard to development, MBCT emphasizes awareness of thoughts, which helps individuals recognize negative thoughts that lead to rumination. It is theorized that this aspect of MBCT is responsible for the observed clinical outcomes. Beyond the use of MBCT to reduce depressive symptoms, research supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing cravings for individuals with substance abuse issues. Addiction is known to involve interference with the prefrontal cortex, which ordinarily allows for delaying of immediate gratification for longer-term benefits by the limbic and paralimbic brain regions. The nucleus accumbens, together with the ventral tegmental area, constitutes the central link in the reward circuit. The nucleus accumbens is also one of the brain structures that is most closely involved in drug dependency. In an experiment with smokers, mindfulness meditation practiced over a two-week period totaling five hours of meditation decreased smoking by about 60% and reduced their cravings, even for those smokers who had no prior intentions to quit. Neuroimaging among those who practice mindfulness meditation reveals increased activity in the prefrontal cortex.Merluzzi, A. (2014). Breaking Bad Habits. APS Observer. 27, 1. Background In 1991, Philip Barnard and John Teasdale created a multilevel concept of the mind called \\"Interacting Cognitive Subsystems\\" (ICS). The ICS model is based on Barnard and Teasdale's concept that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving and processing new information cognitively and emotionally. This concept associates an individual's vulnerability to depression with the degree to which he/she relies on only one of the modes of mind, inadvertently blocking the other modes.Herbert, James D., and Evan M. Forman. Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Understanding and Applying New Theories. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2011. Print. The two main modes of mind are the \\"doing\\" mode and the \\"being\\" mode. The \\"doing\\" mode is also known as the \\"driven\\" mode. This mode is very goal oriented and is triggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are and how the mind wishes things to be.Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression. New York: Guilford Press. The second main mode of mind is the \\"being\\" mode. This mode is not focused on achieving specific goals; instead the emphasis is on \\"accepting and allowing what is,\\" without any immediate pressure to change it.Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression. New York: Guilford Press. p.73 The central component of ICS is metacognitive awareness: the ability to experience negative thoughts and feelings as mental events that pass through the mind, rather than as a part of the self.Herbert, James D., and Evan M. Forman. Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Understanding and Applying New Theories. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2011. Print.p.62 Individuals with high metacognitive awareness are able to avoid depression and negative thought patterns more easily during stressful life situations, in comparison with individuals with low metacognitive awareness. Metacognitive awareness is regularly reflected through an individual's ability to decenter. Decentering is the ability to perceive thoughts and feelings as both impermanent and objective occurrences in the mind. In Barnard and Teasdale's (1991) model, mental health is related to an individual's ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of mind. Individuals who are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind based on conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state. The ICS model theorizes that the \\"being\\" mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to lasting emotional changes. Therefore, to prevent relapse in depression, cognitive therapy must promote this mode. This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT, which promotes the \\"being\\" mode. This therapy was also created by Zindel Segal and Mark Williams and was partially based on the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The theories behind mindfulness-based approaches to psychological issues function on the idea that being aware of things in the present, and not focusing on the past or the future, will allow the individual to be more apt to deal with current stressors and distressing feelings with a flexible and accepting mindset, rather than avoiding and, therefore, prolonging them. Applications The MBCT program is a group intervention that lasts eight weeks. During these eight weeks, there is a weekly course, which lasts two hours, and one day-long class after the fifth week. However, much of the practice is done outside class, with the participant using guided meditations and attempts to cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives. MBCT prioritizes learning how to pay attention or concentrate with purpose, in each moment and, most importantly, without judgment.Fulton, P., Germer, C., Siegel, R. (2005). Mindfulness and Psychotherapy. New York: Guilford Press. Through mindfulness, clients can recognize that holding onto some of these feelings is ineffective and mentally destructive. MBCT focuses on having individuals recognize and be aware of their feelings instead of focusing on changing feelings. Mindfulness is also thought by Fulton et al. to be useful for the therapists during therapy sessions.Fulton, Germer, Siegel, 2005, p.18 MBCT is an intervention program developed to specifically target vulnerability to depressive relapse. Throughout the program, patients learn mind management skills leading to heightened metacognitive awareness, acceptance of negative thought patterns, and an ability to respond in skillful ways. During MBCT patients learn to decenter their negative thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic thought pattern to conscious emotional processing. MBCT can be used as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, though it may be no more effective. Although the primary purpose of MBCT is to prevent relapse in depressive symptomology, clinicians have been formulating ways in which MBCT can be used to treat physical symptoms of other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. Clinicians are also discovering ways to use MBCT to treat the anxiety and weariness associated with these diseases. Evaluation of effectiveness  A meta-analysis by Jacob Piet and Esben Hougaard of the University of Aarhus, Denmark Research found that MBCT could be a viable option for individuals with MDD in preventing a relapse. Various studies have shown that it is most effective with individuals who have a history of at least three or more past episodes of MDD. Within that population, participants with life-event-triggered depressive episodes were least receptive to MBCT. According to a 2017 meta-analysis, mindfulness-based interventions support a decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms, in addition to overall level of patient stress. An MBCT-based program offered by the Tees, Esk, and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust showed that measures of psychological distress, risk of burnout, self-compassion, anxiety, worry, mental well-being, and compassion for others all showed significant improvements after completing the program. Research supports that MBCT results in increased self-reported mindfulness, which suggests increased present- moment awareness, decentering, and acceptance, in addition to decreased maladaptive cognitive processes such as judgment, reactivity, rumination, and thought suppression. Results of a 2017 meta-analysis highlight the importance of home practice and its relation to conducive outcomes for mindfulness-based interventions.

In particular, it does not rely on the possible vector bundle structure of the underlying fiber bundle, but nevertheless, linear connections may be viewed as a special case. Another important special case of Ehresmann connections are principal connections on principal bundles, which are required to be equivariant in the principal Lie group action. Introduction A covariant derivative in differential geometry is a linear differential operator which takes the directional derivative of a section of a vector bundle in a covariant manner. It also allows one to formulate a notion of a parallel section of a bundle in the direction of a vector: a section s is parallel along a vector X if abla_X s = 0. So a covariant derivative provides at least two things: a differential operator, and a notion of what it means to be parallel in each direction. An Ehresmann connection drops the differential operator completely and defines a connection axiomatically in terms of the sections parallel in each direction . Specifically, an Ehresmann connection singles out a vector subspace of each tangent space to the total space of the fiber bundle, called the horizontal space. A section s is then horizontal (i.e., parallel) in the direction X if {\\\\rm d}s(X) lies in a horizontal space. Here we are regarding s as a function s\\\\colon M\\\\to E from the base M to the fiber bundle E, so that {\\\\rm d}s\\\\colon TM\\\\to s^*TE is then the pushforward of tangent vectors. The horizontal spaces together form a vector subbundle of TE. This has the immediate benefit of being definable on a much broader class of structures than mere vector bundles. In particular, it is well-defined on a general fiber bundle. Furthermore, many of the features of the covariant derivative still remain: parallel transport, curvature, and holonomy. The missing ingredient of the connection, apart from linearity, is covariance. With the classical covariant derivatives, covariance is an a posteriori feature of the derivative. In their construction one specifies the transformation law of the Christoffel symbols ‚Äì which is not covariant ‚Äì and then general covariance of the derivative follows as a result. For an Ehresmann connection, it is possible to impose a generalized covariance principle from the beginning by introducing a Lie group acting on the fibers of the fiber bundle. The appropriate condition is to require that the horizontal spaces be, in a certain sense, equivariant with respect to the group action. The finishing touch for an Ehresmann connection is that it can be represented as a differential form, in much the same way as the case of a connection form. If the group acts on the fibers and the connection is equivariant, then the form will also be equivariant. Furthermore, the connection form allows for a definition of curvature as a curvature form as well. Formal definition Let \\\\pi\\\\colon E\\\\to M be a smooth fiber bundle.These considerations apply equally well to the more general situation in which \\\\pi\\\\colon E\\\\to M is a surjective submersion: i.e., E is a fibered manifold over M. In an alternative generalization, due to and , E and M are permitted to be Banach manifolds, with E a fiber bundle over M as above. Let :V= \\\\ker (\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\pi \\\\colon TE\\\\to TM) be the vertical bundle consisting of the vectors \\"tangent to the fibers\\" of E, i.e. the fiber of V at e\\\\in E is V_e =T_e(E_{\\\\pi(e)}). This subbundle of TE is canonically defined while there is no canonical subspace tangent to the base space M. (Of course, this asymmetry comes from the very definition of a fiber bundle, which \\"only has one projection\\" \\\\pi\\\\colon E\\\\to M while a product E=M\\\\times F would have two.) =Definition via horizontal subspaces= An Ehresmann connection on E is a smooth subbundle H of TE, called the horizontal bundle of the connection, which is complementary to V, in the sense that it defines a direct sum decomposition TE=H\\\\oplus V . In more detail, the horizontal bundle has the following properties. * For each point e\\\\in E, H_e is a vector subspace of the tangent space T_e E to E at e, called the horizontal subspace of the connection at e. * H_e depends smoothly on e. * For each e\\\\in E, H_e \\\\cap V_e = \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. * Any tangent vector in TeE (for any e‚ààE) is the sum of a horizontal and vertical component, so that TeE = He \\\\+ Ve. In more sophisticated terms, such an assignment of horizontal spaces satisfying these properties corresponds precisely to a smooth section of the jet bundle J1E ‚Üí E. =Definition via a connection form= Equivalently, let v be the projection onto the vertical bundle V along H (so that H = ker v). This is determined by the above direct sum decomposition of TE into horizontal and vertical parts and is sometimes called the connection form of the Ehresmann connection. Thus v is a vector bundle homomorphism from TE to itself with the following properties (of projections in general): * v2 = v; * v is the identity on V=Image (v). Conversely, if v is a vector bundle endomorphism of TE satisfying these two properties, then H = ker v is the horizontal subbundle of an Ehresmann connection. Finally, note that v, being a linear mapping of each tangent space into itself, may also be regarded as a TE-valued 1-form on E. This will be a useful perspective in sections to come. =Parallel transport via horizontal lifts= An Ehresmann connection also prescribes a manner for lifting curves from the base manifold M into the total space of the fiber bundle E so that the tangents to the curve are horizontal.See and These horizontal lifts are a direct analogue of parallel transport for other versions of the connection formalism. Specifically, suppose that Œ≥(t) is a smooth curve in M through the point x = Œ≥(0). Let e ‚àà Ex be a point in the fiber over x. A lift of Œ≥ through e is a curve \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}(t) in the total space E such that :\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}(0) = e, and \\\\pi(\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}(t)) = \\\\gamma(t). A lift is horizontal if, in addition, every tangent of the curve lies in the horizontal subbundle of TE: :\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}'(t) \\\\in H_{\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}(t)}. It can be shown using the rank‚Äìnullity theorem applied to œÄ and v that each vector X‚ààTxM has a unique horizontal lift to a vector \\\\tilde{X} \\\\in T_e E. In particular, the tangent field to Œ≥ generates a horizontal vector field in the total space of the pullback bundle Œ≥*E. By the Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem, this vector field is integrable. Thus, for any curve Œ≥ and point e over x = Œ≥(0), there exists a unique horizontal lift of Œ≥ through e for small time t. Note that, for general Ehresmann connections, the horizontal lift is path-dependent. When two smooth curves in M, coinciding at Œ≥1(0) = Œ≥2(0) = x0 and also intersecting at another point x1 ‚àà M, are lifted horizontally to E through the same e ‚àà œÄ‚àí1(x0), they will generally pass through different points of œÄ‚àí1(x1). This has important consequences for the differential geometry of fiber bundles: the space of sections of H is not a Lie subalgebra of the space of vector fields on E, because it is not (in general) closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields. This failure of closure under Lie bracket is measured by the curvature. Properties =Curvature= Let v be an Ehresmann connection. Then the curvature of v is given by :R = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}[v,v] where [-,-] denotes the Fr√∂licher-Nijenhuis bracket of v ‚àà Œ©1(E,TE) with itself. Thus R ‚àà Œ©2(E,TE) is the two-form on E with values in TE defined by :R(X,Y) = v\\\\left([(\\\\mathrm{id} - v)X,(\\\\mathrm{id} - v)Y]\\\\right), or, in other terms, :R\\\\left(X,Y\\\\right) = \\\\left[X_H,Y_H\\\\right]_V, where X = XH \\\\+ XV denotes the direct sum decomposition into H and V components, respectively. From this last expression for the curvature, it is seen to vanish identically if, and only if, the horizontal subbundle is Frobenius integrable. Thus the curvature is the integrability condition for the horizontal subbundle to yield transverse sections of the fiber bundle E ‚Üí M. The curvature of an Ehresmann connection also satisfies a version of the Bianchi identity: :\\\\left[v, R\\\\right] = 0 where again [-,-] is the Fr√∂licher-Nijenhuis bracket of v ‚àà Œ©1(E,TE) and R ‚àà Œ©2(E,TE). =Completeness= An Ehresmann connection allows curves to have unique horizontal lifts locally. For a complete Ehresmann connection, a curve can be horizontally lifted over its entire domain. =Holonomy= Flatness of the connection corresponds locally to the Frobenius integrability of the horizontal spaces. At the other extreme, non-vanishing curvature implies the presence of holonomy of the connection.Holonomy for Ehresmann connections in fiber bundles is sometimes called the Ehresmann-Reeb holonomy or leaf holonomy in reference to the first detailed study using Ehresmann connections to study foliations in Special cases =Principal bundles and principal connections= Suppose that E is a smooth principal G-bundle over M. Then an Ehresmann connection H on E is said to be a principal (Ehresmann) connection Volume 1. if it is invariant with respect to the G action on E in the sense that :H_{eg}=\\\\mathrm d(R_g)_e (H_{e}) for any e‚ààE and g‚ààG; here \\\\mathrm d(R_g)_e denotes the differential of the right action of g on E at e. The one- parameter subgroups of G act vertically on E. The differential of this action allows one to identify the subspace V_e with the Lie algebra g of group G, say by map \\\\iota\\\\colon V_e\\\\to \\\\mathfrak g. The connection form v of the Ehresmann connection may then be viewed as a 1-form œâ on E with values in g defined by œâ(X)=Œπ(v(X)). Thus reinterpreted, the connection form œâ satisfies the following two properties: * It transforms equivariantly under the G action: R_h^*\\\\omega=\\\\hbox{Ad}(h^{-1})\\\\omega for all h‚ààG, where Rh* is the pullback under the right action and Ad is the adjoint representation of G on its Lie algebra. * It maps vertical vector fields to their associated elements of the Lie algebra: œâ(X)=Œπ(X) for all X‚ààV. Conversely, it can be shown that such a g-valued 1-form on a principal bundle generates a horizontal distribution satisfying the aforementioned properties. Given a local trivialization one can reduce œâ to the horizontal vector fields (in this trivialization). It defines a 1-form œâ' on B via pullback. The form œâ' determines œâ completely, but it depends on the choice of trivialization. (This form is often also called a connection form and denoted simply by œâ.) =Vector bundles and covariant derivatives= Suppose that E is a smooth vector bundle over M. Then an Ehresmann connection H on E is said to be a linear (Ehresmann) connection if He depends linearly on e ‚àà Ex for each x ‚àà M. To make this precise, let SŒª denote scalar multiplication by Œª on E, and let \\\\sigma:E \\\\times_M E \\\\to E denote addition. Then H is linear if and only if for all x ‚àà M, the following properties are satisfied. * H_{\\\\lambda e} = \\\\mathrm d(S_{\\\\lambda})_e (H_{e})for any e ‚àà E and scalar Œª. * d\\\\sigma(H\\\\boxtimes H)=H where H\\\\boxtimes H denotes the corresponding horizontal subbundle on E\\\\times_M E. Since E is a vector bundle, its vertical bundle V is isomorphic to œÄ*E. Therefore if s is a section of E, then v(ds):TM‚Üís*V=s*œÄ*E=E. It is a vector bundle morphism, and is therefore given by a section ‚àás of the vector bundle Hom(TM,E). The fact that the Ehresmann connection is linear implies that in addition it verifies for every function f on M the Leibniz rule, i.e. abla(f s) = f abla (s) + d(f)\\\\otimes s, and therefore is a covariant derivative of s. Conversely a covariant derivative ‚àá on a vector bundle defines a linear Ehresmann connection by defining He, for e ‚àà E with x=œÄ(e), to be the image dsx(TxM) where s is a section of E with s(x) = e and ‚àáXs = 0 for all X ‚àà TxM. Note that (for historical reasons) the term linear when applied to connections, is sometimes used (like the word affine ‚Äì see Affine connection) to refer to connections defined on the tangent bundle or frame bundle. =Associated bundles= An Ehresmann connection on a fiber bundle (endowed with a structure group) sometimes gives rise to an Ehresmann connection on an associated bundle. For instance, a (linear) connection in a vector bundle E, thought of giving a parallelism of E as above, induces a connection on the associated bundle of frames PE of E. Conversely, a connection in PE gives rise to a (linear) connection in E provided that the connection in PE is equivariant with respect to the action of the general linear group on the frames (and thus a principal connection). It is not always possible for an Ehresmann connection to induce, in a natural way, a connection on an associated bundle. For example, a non-equivariant Ehresmann connection on a bundle of frames of a vector bundle may not induce a connection on the vector bundle. Suppose that E is an associated bundle of P, so that E = P √óG F. A G-connection on E is an Ehresmann connection such that the parallel transport map œÑ : Fx ‚Üí Fx‚Ä≤ is given by a G-transformation of the fibers (over sufficiently nearby points x and x‚Ä≤ in M joined by a curve).See also Lumiste (2001), Connections on a manifold. Given a principal connection on P, one obtains a G-connection on the associated fiber bundle E = P √óG F via pullback. Conversely, given a G-connection on E it is possible to recover the principal connection on the associated principal bundle P. To recover this principal connection, one introduces the notion of a frame on the typical fiber F. Since G is a finite- dimensionalFor convenience, we assume that G is finite-dimensional, although this assumption can safely be dropped with minor modifications. Lie group acting effectively on F, there must exist a finite configuration of points (y1,...,ym) within F such that the G-orbit R = {(gy1,...,gym)  g ‚àà G} is a principal homogeneous space of G. One can think of R as giving a generalization of the notion of a frame for the G-action on F. Note that, since R is a principal homogeneous space for G, the fiber bundle E(R) associated to E with typical fiber R is (equivalent to) the principal bundle associated to E. But it is also a subbundle of the m-fold product bundle of E with itself. The distribution of horizontal spaces on E induces a distribution of spaces on this product bundle. Since the parallel transport maps associated to the connection are G-maps, they preserve the subspace E(R), and so the G-connection descends to a principal G-connection on E(R). In summary, there is a one-to-one correspondence (up to equivalence) between the descents of principal connections to associated fiber bundles, and G-connections on associated fiber bundles. For this reason, in the category of fiber bundles with a structure group G, the principal connection contains all relevant information for G-connections on the associated bundles. Hence, unless there is an overriding reason to consider connections on associated bundles (as there is, for instance, in the case of Cartan connections) one usually works directly with the principal connection.

The W-4 form tells the employer the correct amount of tax to withhold from an employee's paycheck.  Motivation  The W-4 is based on the idea of \\"allowances\\"; the more allowances claimed, the less money the employer withholds for tax purposes. The W-4 Form is usually not sent to the IRS; rather, the employer uses the form in order to calculate how much of an employee's salary is withheld. An employee may claim allowances for oneself, one's spouse, and any dependents, along with other miscellaneous reasons, such as being single with only one job. In the latter case, this creates an oddity in that the employee will have one more exemption on the W-4 than on the 1040 tax return. This is not a tax deduction in itself, but a procedure to prevent under-withholding for those who do not qualify. Nevertheless, it is legal to have \\"self\\" and \\"one job\\" allowances from the highest paid job, provided that all other jobs have zero allowances. Each year, the IRS issues tax refunds to tens of millions of Americans. In 2011 alone, the IRS issued refunds to more than 100 million Americans. That means three out of four returns filed for 2011 called for money back. All told, the government sent about $318 billion to taxpayers, with the average refund being around $2,900. Claiming allowances on the W-4 and updating it frequently effectively lets the taxpayer claim refunds ahead of time, by not overpaying in the first place. Over-withholding can occur if, for example, an employee receives a one-time bonus, or only a partial year is worked, as it may only take into account the current paycheck, rather than the year-to-date amount. (i.e. Withholding is calculated as if the employee earned this amount every payday on an annual basis.)  Filing  The W-4 Form includes a series of worksheets for calculating the number of allowances to claim. One must provide some personal information and report the total allowances and additional withholding amounts on the actual form. The employee must tear off this certificate and hand it to their employer. One may request an exemption from employer withholding (of income, but not payroll tax) if one had no income tax in the previous year and does not expect to owe any taxes in the current year. If one works more than a single job or has a working spouse, the IRS recommends claiming all allowances on the W-4 Form for the highest paying job and claiming zero allowances for any other jobs. The IRS also recommends filing a new W-4 Form anytime a major life event occurs. The W-4 Form itself does not indicate that anticipated losses can also be taken into account. If one expects a deductible loss from a business or rental activity or investment, for example, withholding can be adjusted to account for the resulting reduction in the tax bill. Tax withholding depends on the employee's personal situation and ideally should be equal to the annual tax due on the Form 1040. When filling out a Form W-4 an employee calculates the number of Form W-4 allowances to claim based on their expected tax filing situation for the year. No interest is paid on over-withholding, but penalties might be imposed for under-withholding. Alternatively, or in addition, the employee can send quarterly estimated tax payments directly to the IRS (Form 1040-ES). Quarterly estimates may be required if the employee has additional income (e.g. investments or self-employment income) not subject to withholding or insufficiently withheld. Quarterly payments can also be required for a few years as a penalty for under withholding more than a nominal amount. There are specialized versions of the W-4 Form for other types of payment; for example, W-4P for pensions, and the voluntary W-4V for certain government payments such as unemployment compensation.

The film was directed by Paul Wendkos and produced by Vincent M. Fennelly. It stars George Kennedy as Chris Adams, the character Yul Brynner portrayed in the first two films. The additions to the cast to make up the \\"new\\" seven are Monte Markham, Bernie Casey, James Whitmore, Reni Santoni, Joe Don Baker and Scott Thomas. Each have their quirks and baggage. They band together to help free a Mexican revolutionary (Fernando Rey) and help fight the oppression of sadistic militarist Diego played by Michael Ansara. Elmer Bernstein once again provides the music. Plot In late 19th-century Mexico, Federales capture Quintero (Fernando Rey), a revolutionary who attempts to rally those opposing the dictatorship of President D√≠az. Before going to prison, Quintero gives his lieutenant, Maximiliano O'Leary (Reni Santoni), $600 () with which to continue the cause. Bandit chief Carlos Lobero (Frank Silvera) demands that the money be used for guns and ammunition, but Max instead crosses the border in search of Chris Adams (George Kennedy): a legendary, American gunman whom his cousin had told him about. Max finally finds the laconic Chris, witnessing him free a man from a rigged trial, first by using his wits, then with the famed hair- trigger skill as a gunfighter. Chris agrees to mount a rescue of Quintero and uses $500 of Max's money to recruit five highly trained combatants: Keno (Monte Markham), a horse thief and hand-to-hand combat expert (whom Chris saved from hanging); Cassie (Bernie Casey), a brawny but intelligent former slave, who can handle dynamite; Slater (Joe Don Baker), a one-armed, sideshow sharp-shootist; a tubercular wrangler called \\"P.J.\\" (Scott Thomas), and Levi Morgan (James Whitmore), an aging family man who is doubtful of his worth, despite his incredible knife-throwing skills. En route to Mexico, the motley band of Americans becomes less mercenary when observing the brutal treatment of the peasants. Their journey is marked by encounters with a political prisoner's little boy, Emiliano Zapata (Tony Davis) and a pretty peasant girl, Tina (Wende Wagner), who falls in love with P.J. When Lobero learns that Max did not buy guns with the $600, he refuses to allow his men to take part in Quintero's rescue. Realizing that he needs support, Chris frees a prison gang that includes Zapata's father, then trains them in military tactics. Despite their superior fighting skills and strategy, Chris' men are outnumbered and their valiant effort to free Quintero appears doomed. At the last moment, 50 of Lobero's bandits, having slain their leader for his lack of patriotism, thunder onto the prison grounds and turn the tide of battle. Of the original seven, only Chris, Max and Levi survive. Before riding home, Chris and Levi leave behind the $600 the peasants had collected.

Mirisch surrounded Kennedy with a strong cast, with Monte Markham giving a thinly-disguised Steve McQueen-like performance, in the same wardrobe McQueen wore in The Magnificent Seven. Elmer Bernstein was on hand to reprise part of original score of The Magnificent Seven and adding new elements. Mirisch also had his contract director Paul Wendkos direct.

Owned by Morgans Hotel Group, this was the first property in the group and opened in 1984. Andr√©e Putman served as interior designer for the 1984 renovation of this 1927 structure.  Design features  New design features are evident throughout Morgans' public spaces. A sampling of these features includes: A \\"Living-Room\\" Lobby, with textured taupe-colored glass walls with overlaid bronze mullions, featuring a custom Putman-designed wool rug of black, rich camel and taupe in a bold three-dimensional cubist pattern; floors in three varied shades of imported Italian granite in different finishes; groupings of antique French leather club chairs, including a teak and caned plantation chair from the '40s, all culled from Paris' top flea markets; Putman-designed dark wood end tables. Spherical-shaped desk lamps in nickel- plated brass are created by F√©lix Aublet in 1925. Candles in the evening coupled with black-and-white checkerboard patterned wool throws loosely draped over the French club chairs further accentuate the \\"lived-in\\" feel. Morgans is currently undergoing renovations of its bar and restaurant. The new concepts should be introduced Fall, 2012.  Guest accommodations  Like everything else in Morgans, the 114 guest rooms steered away from formulaic institutional design. To update guest lodgings, Ms. Putman began in the hotel corridors, which are covered in wool carpet in rich taupe with a black-and-white checkerboard patterned border. Guest room doors are of French custom-birdseye maple. With only four to eight rooms per floor, each hallway contributes to the hotel's residential feel. Inside the room, the walls are painted with a mixture of four muted tones, producing an effect like that of an \\"Impressionist wall painting\\" ‚Äî an unusual backdrop for the specially commissioned black and white photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. In addition to a regular closet, each room features a four-drawer dresser cabinet with full-length lighted wardrobe mirror. Inside the bathroom, unconventional features include customized stainless steel airplane-like sinks and hospital fixtures, floor-to-ceiling shower doors and partitions in 3/4\\" glass and poured -in-lace granite floors. Morgans' duplex penthouse suite is a 19th- floor suite that comes complete with its own greenhouse, kitchen, multimedia room with 60\\" Sony color television, curved staircase and two terraces with city views. Decorated in the same spirit as all Morgans' guest rooms, the suite offers a classic black wood bench by Bertola; and Ecart steel tube and opaline glass coffee tables.  Building history  Morgans Hotel began as the Hotel Duane, a 1927 structure intended for long-term residents, designed by architect Andrew J. Thomas. According to an article of the era, \\"In design the exterior of the building indicates a free interpretation of the Italian Romanesque style harmonizing very well with the Fraternity Clubs building at the north, designed in a similar style.\\" When initially opened, the lobby and guest rooms showed \\"a rather free interpretation of Spanish Renaissance decoration.\\" Prior to its 1984 renovation, the hotel had operated under the name, Executive Hotel. The building was purchased in July 2017 by Shel Capital and Kash Group. As of 2018, the hotel is closed.

In the year of 1776 a sandy stone animal head was dug out. This could be a further indication in favour of this theory. After a legend, in the year 750 Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria (Agilolfings dynasty) lost his way in the woods around Thierhaupten and swore to God to build a monastery (Thierhaupten Abbey) at the place of his rescue. Suddenly a hind appeared and showed him his way back (German hunter's jargon: Tier = hind). Still today a hind is on the Thierhaupten coat of arms. Thierhaupten Abbey was one of the eldest monasteries in Bavaria. The abbey was looted by the Hungarians in 955. It was destroyed by the Swabian League in 1504 but re-built, although it was always a small community. Finally it was dissolved in 1803 in the secularisation of Bavaria. The buildings were sold off to a local businessman. The last abbot, Edmund Schmid, remained in Thierhaupten as the parish priest, and succeeded in 1812 in acquiring the former abbey church for use as the parish church. The remaining buildings gradually fell into disrepair, but were bought by the Thierhaupten market town administration in 1983 and renovated.

They lived from the Eocene to Miocene epochs, 46.3‚Äî13.6 mya, existing for approximately .Poebrotherium at fossilworks Discovery and history Fossil of Poebrotherium sp. in CosmoCaixa Barcelona Poebrotherium was first named by scientist Joseph Leidy in 1848, and its relationship to other White River fossils was later expanded by him in 1853. Fur trapper Samuel Culbertson was working in Nebraska in pursuit of fur bearing mammals, and found a collection of strange fossil animal bones. He sent a box of these bones to his family back east, and not knowing what to make of them, they forwarded the remains to Leidy for identification. Several animals' remains were included in this package, but one of the most interesting was that of a small mammal, about the size of a small deer or sheep. In addition to a partial skull, a portion of a forelimb was found. The portions that Leidy was able to examine helped him determine it was likely related to modern llamas, even though there was a paucity of new material available after his 1848 diagnosis. This package spawned Leidy's interest in the White River badlands and its fauna, and he eventually sent collectors from the American Museum west to expand his collection. Between 1848 and 1853, cases of new material were shipping back to Leidy. Maddeningly, only three more Poebrotherium tooth samples were among the remains recovered. Etymology The term poebrotherium comes from (, \\"grass- eating\\") and (, \\"wild animal; animal; \\"beast\\"), in Latinised form. The specific epithet is the Latinised name of a person or place, or a Latin adjective denoting a postulated characteristic of the species. Species *Poebrotherium wilsoni can be translated as \\"[Dr. Thomas] Wilson's grass- eating beast\\". *Poebrotherium chadronensis can be translated as \\"grass-eating beast from Chadron [formation]\\". *Poebrotherium franki can be translated as \\"Frank's grass-eating beast\\". *Poebrotherium eximium can be translated as \\"Extraordinary grass-eating beast\\" *Poebrotherium labratrum can be translated as \\"Chief grass-eating beast\\" or \\"Royal grass-eating beast\\" Description Restoration of P. labratum Poebrotherium looked more like modern camels than its predecessor Protylopus, but at in height, it was roughly the size of a modern sheep. Its skull resembled that of a modern llama, while its limbs ended in hooved toes and were more built for speed than the feet of Protylopus. Despite this apparent adaptation to the open plains, Poebrotherium has been found in all major White River environments, including forests and river overbank deposits, indicating that it was not tied to one particular environment. The teeth of Poebrotherium were more generalised than those of modern camelids. In fact, despite the name meaning \\"grass-eating beast\\" it is likely that Poebrotherium was either a browser or a mixed-feeder, and grass may have played a minimal role in the diet of Poebrotherium. Milan Natural History Museum Right dentary dentition of a juvenile P. wilsoni from the White River Badlands. Unlike its modern cousins, which are either adapted for desert or alpine conditions, Poebrotherium took the place of a gazelle or deer in the White River Fauna ecosystem. This trait was taken to an extreme in later camels, notably Stenomylus. Fossil evidence has shown that Poebrotherium was a popular prey item for the entelodont Archaeotherium. Remains of partial Poebrotherium carcasses have been found fossilized, and appear to have been killed and cached by Archaeotherium, the only animal known from the White River ecosystem that could have made the feeding marks found on the bones of Poebrotherium. Relationships Poebrotherium lies within the clade Camelidae, which can be defined as (Stenomylinae + (Miolabinae + (Protolabinae + Camelinae))) + Poebrotherium. As such, Poebrotherium lies outside the Camelinae proper. In fact the definition of Camelidae is the most recent common ancestor of Poebrotherium and Camelus, and all of its descendants. Several authors offer characteristics to define Poebrotherium. These include a long neck; an adult height of around ; relatively unspecialized teeth; moderately long legs; long, unsplayed, unfused, and proximally wider-than-deep metapodials; a pes lacking digits 1, 4, and 5; and a typical ungulate stance but lacking in a foot pad.Prothero, DR & RM Schoch (2002), Horns, Tusks, and Flippers: the Evolution of Hoofed Mammals.

It was never held and was abolished in 1989.  History  The rank of Marschall der DDR was established on 25 March 1982 by decree of the Staatsrat der DDR (State Council of the GDR), but never bestowed. The Staatsrat could promote a general to this rank for exceptional military achievement. The rank was an imitation of the supreme Soviet rank, that of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Some believe that this rank would only have been granted in wartime and was created as a result of changes in Warsaw Pact military planning. During wartime, a Marschall der DDR was to command an operational Army group that included all East German forces to include Police and Stasi troops. Prior to this change all East German forces were under the direct control of the Soviet military command. In November 1989 the acting Minister for National Defense (amtierender Minister f√ºr Nationale Verteidigung), Admiral Theodor Hoffmann, abolished this rank.  Design  Several designs were considered for the Marschall shoulder board. The final design was a shoulder board 118 mm long and 48 mm wide consisting of interlaced gold and silver cord backed by a red cloth material on which was placed a five-pointed, gilded star with a red ruby in the center. According to Klaus Wather's Uniformeffekten der bewaffneten Organe der DDR Band II, 12 pairs of these shoulder boards were made. Drawings were also made of a Soviet-style \\"Marshal's star\\" to be worn on a red neck ribbon but this item was never produced. Also planned were Marschall rank insignia for the new field uniform. This consisted of a 90 x 60 mm rectangular badge of stone-grey cloth for mounting on the upper uniform sleeve. On this badge was woven a large five-pointed gold colored star with a red center over a 20 mm long horizontal gold bar. For the cap there was an oval badge 50 √ó 30 mm with the same design as the sleeve insignia.

The theory originated in 1957 in the doctoral dissertations of Dina van Hiele-Geldof and Pierre van Hiele (wife and husband) at Utrecht University, in the Netherlands. The Soviets did research on the theory in the 1960s and integrated their findings into their curricula. American researchers did several large studies on the van Hiele theory in the late 1970s and early 1980s, concluding that students' low van Hiele levels made it difficult to succeed in proof-oriented geometry courses and advising better preparation at earlier grade levels. Pierre van Hiele published Structure and Insight in 1986, further describing his theory. The model has greatly influenced geometry curricula throughout the world through emphasis on analyzing properties and classification of shapes at early grade levels. In the United States, the theory has influenced the geometry strand of the Standards published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the new Common Core Standards. Van Hiele levels > The student learns by rote to operate with [mathematical] relations that he > does not understand, and of which he has not seen the origin‚Ä¶. Therefore the > system of relations is an independent construction having no rapport with > other experiences of the child. This means that the student knows only what > has been taught to him and what has been deduced from it. He has not learned > to establish connections between the system and the sensory world. He will > not know how to apply what he has learned in a new situation. - Pierre van > Hiele, 1959 The best known part of the van Hiele model are the five levels which the van Hieles postulated to describe how children learn to reason in geometry. Students cannot be expected to prove geometric theorems until they have built up an extensive understanding of the systems of relationships between geometric ideas. These systems cannot be learned by rote, but must be developed through familiarity by experiencing numerous examples and counterexamples, the various properties of geometric figures, the relationships between the properties, and how these properties are ordered. The five levels postulated by the van Hieles describe how students advance through this understanding. The five van Hiele levels are sometimes misunderstood to be descriptions of how students understand shape classification, but the levels actually describe the way that students reason about shapes and other geometric ideas. Pierre van Hiele noticed that his students tended to \\"plateau\\" at certain points in their understanding of geometry and he identified these plateau points as levels. In general, these levels are a product of experience and instruction rather than age. This is in contrast to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which is age-dependent. A child must have enough experiences (classroom or otherwise) with these geometric ideas to move to a higher level of sophistication. Through rich experiences, children can reach Level 2 in elementary school. Without such experiences, many adults (including teachers) remain in Level 1 all their lives, even if they take a formal geometry course in secondary school. The levels are as follows: Children at Level 0 will often say all of these shapes are triangles, except E, which is too \\"skinny\\". They may say F is \\"upside down\\". Students at Level 1 will recognize that only E and F are valid triangles. Level 0. Visualization: At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, \\"That is a circle,\\" usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures (triangle, circle, square). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child‚Äôs mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a \\"triangle\\", because it's so different in shape from an equilateral triangle, which is the usual prototype for \\"triangle\\". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is \\"upside down\\". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as \\"triangles\\" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle. Squares are called \\"diamonds\\" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45¬∞ to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example. Level 1. Analysis: At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, \\"A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other.\\" The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that \\"a square is not a rectangle.\\" (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason inductively from several examples, but cannot yet reason deductively because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related. Level 2. Abstraction: At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, \\"Isosceles triangles are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal.\\" Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each. They can tell whether it is possible or not to have a rectangle that is, for example, also a rhombus. They understand necessary and sufficient conditions and can write concise definitions. However, they do not yet understand the intrinsic meaning of deduction. They cannot follow a complex argument, understand the place of definitions, or grasp the need for axioms, so they cannot yet understand the role of formal geometric proofs. Level 3. Deduction: Students at this level understand the meaning of deduction. The object of thought is deductive reasoning (simple proofs), which the student learns to combine to form a system of formal proofs (Euclidean geometry). Learners can construct geometric proofs at a secondary school level and understand their meaning. They understand the role of undefined terms, definitions, axioms and theorems in Euclidean geometry. However, students at this level believe that axioms and definitions are fixed, rather than arbitrary, so they cannot yet conceive of non-Euclidean geometry. Geometric ideas are still understood as objects in the Euclidean plane. Level 4. Rigor: At this level, geometry is understood at the level of a mathematician. Students understand that definitions are arbitrary and need not actually refer to any concrete realization. The object of thought is deductive geometric systems, for which the learner compares axiomatic systems. Learners can study non-Euclidean geometries with understanding. People can understand the discipline of geometry and how it differs philosophically from non- mathematical studies. American researchers renumbered the levels as 1 to 5 so that they could add a \\"Level 0\\" which described young children who could not identify shapes at all. Both numbering systems are still in use. Some researchers also give different names to the levels. Properties of the levels The van Hiele levels have five properties: 1\\\\. Fixed sequence: the levels are hierarchical. Students cannot \\"skip\\" a level. The van Hieles claim that much of the difficulty experienced by geometry students is due to being taught at the Deduction level when they have not yet achieved the Abstraction level. 2\\\\. Adjacency: properties which are intrinsic at one level become extrinsic at the next. (The properties are there at the Visualization level, but the student is not yet consciously aware of them until the Analysis level. Properties are in fact related at the Analysis level, but students are not yet explicitly aware of the relationships.) 3\\\\. Distinction: each level has its own linguistic symbols and network of relationships. The meaning of a linguistic symbol is more than its explicit definition; it includes the experiences the speaker associates with the given symbol. What may be \\"correct\\" at one level is not necessarily correct at another level. At Level 0 a square is something that looks like a box. At Level 2 a square is a special type of rectangle. Neither of these is a correct description of the meaning of \\"square\\" for someone reasoning at Level 1. If the student is simply handed the definition and its associated properties, without being allowed to develop meaningful experiences with the concept, the student will not be able to apply this knowledge beyond the situations used in the lesson. 4\\\\. Separation: a teacher who is reasoning at one level speaks a different \\"language\\" from a student at a lower level, preventing understanding. When a teacher speaks of a \\"square\\" she or he means a special type of rectangle. A student at Level 0 or 1 will not have the same understanding of this term. The student does not understand the teacher, and the teacher does not understand how the student is reasoning, frequently concluding that the student's answers are simply \\"wrong\\". The van Hieles believed this property was one of the main reasons for failure in geometry. Teachers believe they are expressing themselves clearly and logically, but their Level 3 or 4 reasoning is not understandable to students at lower levels, nor do the teachers understand their students‚Äô thought processes. Ideally, the teacher and students need shared experiences behind their language. 5\\\\. Attainment: The van Hieles recommended five phases for guiding students from one level to another on a given topic:The van Hiele Model of Geometric Thought *Information or inquiry: students get acquainted with the material and begin to discover its structure. Teachers present a new idea and allow the students to work with the new concept. By having students experience the structure of the new concept in a similar way, they can have meaningful conversations about it. (A teacher might say, \\"This is a rhombus. Construct some more rhombi on your paper.\\") *Guided or directed orientation: students do tasks that enable them to explore implicit relationships. Teachers propose activities of a fairly guided nature that allow students to become familiar with the properties of the new concept which the teacher desires them to learn. (A teacher might ask, \\"What happens when you cut out and fold the rhombus along a diagonal? the other diagonal?\\" and so on, followed by discussion.) *Explicitation: students express what they have discovered and vocabulary is introduced. The students‚Äô experiences are linked to shared linguistic symbols. The van Hieles believe it is more profitable to learn vocabulary after students have had an opportunity to become familiar with the concept. The discoveries are made as explicit as possible. (A teacher might say, \\"Here are the properties we have noticed and some associated vocabulary for the things you discovered. Let's discuss what these mean.\\") *Free orientation: students do more complex tasks enabling them to master the network of relationships in the material. They know the properties being studied, but need to develop fluency in navigating the network of relationships in various situations. This type of activity is much more open- ended than the guided orientation. These tasks will not have set procedures for solving them. Problems may be more complex and require more free exploration to find solutions. (A teacher might say, \\"How could you construct a rhombus given only two of its sides?\\" and other problems for which students have not learned a fixed procedure.) *Integration: students summarize what they have learned and commit it to memory. The teacher may give the students an overview of everything they have learned. It is important that the teacher not present any new material during this phase, but only a summary of what has already been learned. The teacher might also give an assignment to remember the principles and vocabulary learned for future work, possibly through further exercises. (A teacher might say, \\"Here is a summary of what we have learned. Write this in your notebook and do these exercises for homework.\\") Supporters of the van Hiele model point out that traditional instruction often involves only this last phase, which explains why students do not master the material. For Dina van Hiele-Geldof's doctoral dissertation, she conducted a teaching experiment with 12-year-olds in a Montessori secondary school in the Netherlands. She reported that by using this method she was able to raise students' levels from Level 0 to 1 in 20 lessons and from Level 1 to 2 in 50 lessons. Research > Using van Hiele levels as the criterion, almost half of geometry students > are placed in a course in which their chances of being successful are only > 50-50. ‚Äî Zalman Usiskin, 1982 Researchers found that the van Hiele levels of American students are low. European researchers have found similar results for European students. Many, perhaps most, American students do not achieve the Deduction level even after successfully completing a proof-oriented high school geometry course, probably because material is learned by rote, as the van Hieles claimed. This appears to be because American high school geometry courses assume students are already at least at Level 2, ready to move into Level 3, whereas many high school students are still at Level 1, or even Level 0. See the Fixed Sequence property above. =Criticism and modifications of the theory= The levels are discontinuous, as defined in the properties above, but researchers have debated as to just how discrete the levels actually are. Studies have found that many children reason at multiple levels, or intermediate levels, which appears to be in contradiction to the theory. Children also advance through the levels at different rates for different concepts, depending on their exposure to the subject. They may therefore reason at one level for certain shapes, but at another level for other shapes. Some researchers have found that many children at the Visualization level do not reason in a completely holistic fashion, but may focus on a single attribute, such as the equal sides of a square or the roundness of a circle. They have proposed renaming this level the syncretic level. Other modifications have also been suggested, such as defining sub-levels between the main levels, though none of these modifications have yet gained popularity.

It is located on Piazza Benedetto Cairoli, 117 just off the corner of Via Arenula and Via dei Falegnami, a few blocks south of the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle. The attribute ai Catinari refers to the presence, at the time of its construction, of the many makers of wooden basins who worked in the area.Jones, Pamela J., Altarpieces and Their Viewers in the Churches of Rome from Caravaggio to Guido Reni, Routledge, 2017, p. 142 The church was commissioned by the Order of the Barnabites and funded by the Milanese community in Rome to honour their fellow Milanese St. Charles Borromeo (Italian: San Carlo). It is one of at least three Roman churches dedicated to him, including San Carlo al Corso and San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (San Carlino). History The Barnabites in Milan had had close ties to Cardinal Borromeo. He had helped draft the order's constitutions, and they had assisted in ministering during the plague of 1576. When their little church of San Biagio all'Anello in Rome had become too small, they purchased adjoining land and constructed a larger one. Borromeo had been canonized in November 1610. Construction began in September 1611 making this the first church in Rome dedicated to him. In 1618 S. Biagio's was razed, and the new name formally conferred on the parish. Architecture The main design was by Rosato Rosati between 1612 and 1620, at the private expense of Cardinal Giambattista Leni.Head, George. Rome: A Tour of Many Days, Vol. 1, London, Longman, Brown et al, 1849, p. 437 The travertine fa√ßade was designed by Giovanni Battista Soria and construction occurred in 1635-38. The dome is one of the largest in the city. Annunciazione - Lanfranco (Catinari) Interior The interior has yellow scagliola pilasters. The pendentives of the cupola are frescoed with the Cardinal Virtues (1627‚Äì30) by Domenichino who designed the stucco decoration in the dome and probably the other main vaults.Blunt, Anthony 1982, Granada Giovanni Giacomo Semenza had originally been given the commission and threatened to sue. Shortly after finishing the work Domenichino left for Naples.Cropper, Elizabeth. The Domenichino Affair: Novelty, Imitation, and Theft in Seventeenth-century Rome, Chap 5, Yale University Press, 2005 The pavement is of inlaid marble. In the choir is the fresco of S. Carlo Borromeo in Glory; executed in 1646-1647, this is the last painting by Giovanni Lanfranco. Directly behind the high altar is the oil painting of S. Carlo carrying the Holy Nail in Procession during the Plague by Pietro da Cortona. The high altar itself was designed by Martino Longhi the Younger. On the entrance wall are frescoes by Gregorio and Mattia Preti, showing episodes from the Life of Saint Charles (1642). To the right of the High Altar is an architecturally inventive late-Baroque chapel designed by Antonio Gherardi and built 1695-1700. The view upwards is through an oculus surrounded by angels in the centre of a dark shallow dome, to a rectangular light filled room above illuminated by windows which are not visible from below. In addition, he painted the altarpiece of S. Cecilia in the chapel. Gherardi also designed the equally inventive Avila Chapel in Santa Maria in Trastevere. The first chapel on the right has an Annunciation (1624) by Lanfranco; in the second chapel, there is a Martyrdom of San Biagio by Giacinto Brandi. The second chapel on the left has an altarpiece depicting the Death of Saint Anne by Andrea Sacchi. Adjoining this chapel, on the southwest pier is a monument of Cardinal Gerdil, a Barnabite theologian buried in the church. The third chapel was designed by Paolo Maruscelli with frescoes of the Persian Martyrdoms (1641) by Giovan Francesco Romanelli and lunettes by Giacinto Gimignani. The passage behind the High Altar has canvases depicting St. Charles in Prayer (1620) by Guido Reni and St. Charles by Andrea Commodi, as well as a Miracle of St. Blaise (1669) by Cerrini. The bronze crucifix in the sacristy is attributed to Alessandro Algardi and Christ Derided (1598) by Cavalier D'Arpino. The church contains some notable relics, including the skull of St. Febronia of Nisibis, moved here from the old church of St. Paul after the latter was demolished for the construction of Palazzo Chigi. This relic, kept together with two other skulls of saints, is visible in fenestella confessionis altar.

Retrieved on 6 March 2012Irish Saints in Great Britain, pp. 76‚Äì77) was a Scottish missionary, and a contemporary of Saint Columba, who evangelized the Picts of Scotland in the sixth century. Saint Moluag was the patron saint of Argyll as evidenced by a charter in 1544, from the Earl of Argyll, which states \\"in honour of God Omnipotent, the blessed Virgin, and Saint Moloc, our patron\\". The House of Lorne became the kings of Dalriada and eventually united with the Picts to become the kings of Scots. Name Saint Lughaidh, better known by his pet name of Moluag, was an Irish noble of the D√°l nAraideLismore in Alba, p. 39ff (one of the main tribes of the Ulaid in what is now called Ulster). There are various Irish forms of the name, such as Lughaidh (or Lugaid), Luoc and Lua. Latinized they become Lugidus, Lugidius, Lugadius, Lugacius and Luanus. The name, as it has come down the centuries, Moluag or Moluoc, is made up of the honorific mo, plus the original name Lughaidh, pronounced Lua, plus the endearing suffix ‚Äìoc. Other variants include Lugdach, Malew, Molonachus, Moloc and Molucus. Sources MacDonald suggests that there must have been a vita of Moluag that is lost because of his prominent appearance in Bernard's Life of Malachy. He writes ‚ÄòFurther support for this occurs in the Life of Patrick by the Cistercian monk Jocelin of Furness written in circa 1185, where Mo-Lu√≥c (‚ÄúLugacius‚Äù) is described as one of the six Irish priests whom Patrick prophesied would become bishops‚Äô. In a footnote he adds that the five other priests were Columbanus (C√≥lman), Meldanus (Mell√°n), Lugadius (Mo Lua), Cassanus (Cass√°n) and Creanus (Ciar√°n). Moluag was a bishop active during the period of the First Order of Celtic Saints and known as ‚ÄòThe Clear and Brilliant, The Sun of Lismore in Alba‚Äô. The First Order were ‚Äòmost holy: shining like the sun‚Äô. This is a clear reference to his membership of the First Order. Life Moluag was born between 500 and 520. He may have been the Lugaid mentioned in The Life of St Comgall who ordained him and to whom he may have had links of kinship. He left with twelve followers to lead the life of a missionary. Tradition states that the rock on which Moluag stood detached itself from the Irish coast and he drifted across to the island of the Lyn of Lorn in Argyll now called the Isle of Lismore, in Loch Linnhe,Barrett, M, A Calendar of Scottish Saints, pp. 97‚Äì99 where, in 562, he founded his community. (Lios mor is ancient Gaelic for ‚Äògreat courtyard‚Äô in reference to the monastery). This had been the sacred island of the Western Picts whose capital was at Beregonium, across the water at Benderloch. Lismore was the most important religious spot to the pagan kings of the area. Their kings were cremated on the ancient man-made ‚Äòburial mound‚Äô of Cnoc Aingeil (Gaelic for ‚ÄòHill of Fire‚Äô) at Bachuil, about three miles from the north of the island, near to the site that Moluag chose for his first centre. It was therefore the most desirable site for a missionary. Irish missionaries had learnt to focus heavily on the similarity and continuity between early Christianity and Paganism rather than the differences between them. The conversion process was, therefore, one of gradual education rather than outright confrontation and there were few martyrs in the area. MacDonald describes Lismore as being ‚Äòhugely important, being closely tied with one of the earliest and most important Christian Saints in Northern Britain: Mo Lu√≥c, or Moluag.‚Äô After founding an island monastery on the Isle of Lismore, Moluag went on to found two other great centres in the land of the Picts at Rosemarkie and Mortlach. These were his three centres of teaching, and all three were to become the seats of the Roman Catholic Sees of the Isles, Ross and Aberdeen. W. Douglas Simpson noted that Moluag laboured in Argyll, Ross, and Banff but remains most noted for his work in Aberdeenshire, where he established three churches in the valley of the River Dee‚ÄîTarland, Migvie, and Durris. However, Simpson regarded the most important of Moluag‚Äôs establishments to be the Clova Monastery in Kildrummy. In his life of the Irish Saint Malachy, Bernard of Clairvaux wrote of Moluag, ‚ÄúOne of the sons of that sacred family (Bangor) Lua by name, is said himself alone to have been the founder of a hundred monasteries,‚Äù Michael Barrett clarifying this as a reference to monastic houses in Ireland. Moluag lived to extreme old age and died on 25 June 592 in the Garioch and was buried at his monastery in Rosemarkie, Ross-shire, Scotland. The Annals of Ulster record the death of Lugaid of Les M√≥r in 592: Obitus Lugide Lis Moer. Veneration Moluag is said to have been buried at Rosemarkie on the Moray Firth, though his remains were later transported to Lismore, and honoured in the cathedral which bore his name. The feast day of Saint Moluag (25 June) was restored in 1898 by Pope Leo XIII. He is one of the 48 saints referred to in the Lorrha (\\"Stowe\\") Missal used by churches of Ireland, Scotland, Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy: \\"Saint Lua of Lismore, Pray for us\\". The Coarb, or successor, of Saint Moluag, is the Livingstone chief of the Clan MacLea. This Livingstone family of Lismore had long been the hereditary abbots of Lismore and, hence, possessors of the crozier of the saint. The bell of Saint Moluag was in existence until the sixteenth century when it disappeared during the Reformation. An ancient bell found at Kilmichael Glassary, Argyll was thought to have been the lost bell. Legacy and dedications Several churches were dedicated to Saint Moluag, including: * St Moluag's Cathedral (Kilmoluag), Lismore; * Teampull Mholuaidh, Lewis; * Kirk Malew, the Isle of Man. Other sites include churches at Clatt and Tarland, in Aberdeenshire; and also churches on Skye, Mull, Raasay, Tiree, and Pabay. At Alyth in Perth and Kinross there remain the ruins, known as \\"The Alyth Arches\\",http://www.scotland247.co.uk/alyth2.htm Retrieved on 12 June 2007 of a church which was built on the site of an older sixth-century church dedicated to the saint. It has been suggested that the concentration of dedications to Moluag in North-East Scotland, and particularly in the vicinity of Rhynie, may be a legacy of a saint cult promoted during the reign of Nechtan mac Der-Ilei and contemporaneous with the ascendancy of the Cen√©l Loairn, with whom his Pictish kingdom appears to have enjoyed good relations.Grigg, Juliana (2015), The Philosopher King and the Pictish Nation, Four Courts Press, Dublin At Mortlach in Banffshire, where some of his relics were preserved, an abbey was founded in 1010 by M√°el Coluim II of Scotland, in thanks for a victory in which the Scots had invoked the aid of Saint Moluag. On Lewis, Saint Moluag was invoked for cures from madness. At Clatt there was held annually \\"St Mallock's Fair\\", which lasted eight days. At Tarland there was a \\"Luoch Fair\\" which is thought to have been in honour of Saint Molaug, and at Alyth \\"Simmalogue Fair\\" was celebrated. Notes References * Barrett, Michael.

History The diocese was founded in 739. The bishops were Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, ruling a territory known as the Prince-Bishopric of Regensburg. They were not among the most powerful Prince-Bishops, due to the existence of other reichsfrei authorities in Regensburgthe town of Regensburg itself, which was a Reichsstadt, and the three Reichsabteien of St. Emmeram's Abbey, the Niederm√ºnster and the Oberm√ºnster that prevented them from consolidating a major territorial base. With the dissolution of the Archbishopric of Mainz on that territory's annexation by France in 1802, the Bishopric of Regensburg was elevated to the Archbishopric of Regensburg. It was part of the Principality of Regensburg, ruled by the Prince-Primate Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg. The end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and its aftermath saw the end of the territorial claim of the bishops. With the death of Dalberg in 1817, the archdiocese was downgraded to being a suffragan of the Archbishops of Munich and Freising.

The organization aims to create a bridge between international media activities and the media developments in the region. It has headquarters and national committees in several countries. In total 33 member states or territories are included in SEEMO: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova (with the territory of Transdnestria), Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan History SEEMO was founded in October 2000 in Zagreb, Croatia, by a group of leading editors-in-chief, media executives and professors of journalism and communications from Southeast Europe, in the presence of representatives of international institutions. SEEMO was part of the International Press Institute (IPI) from 2000-2015; since 2016 it has worked independently. The Secretary General of SEEMO, who initiated the founding, is since 2000 Oliver Vujovic, a former journalist and expert in public relations, political relations and business in South, East and Central Europe.  Activities  One of SEEMO's main activities is protecting press freedom by helping journalists and media outlets in South East Europe. Over 60 per cent of SEEMO's press releases and letters of protest to governmental and other officials have had positive results in the past. Every SEEMO protest is distributed to leading regional and international media, national and international governmental and non-governmental organisations, politicians, and also public persons and institutions. In the past, SEEMO has provided direct help to journalists in the region by giving them technical equipment and other assistance. SEEMO also provided the necessary aid to journalists, who received death threats. SEEMO has over 1650 editors-in-chief, media executives and leading journalists from South East Europe as individual members, and over 100 media outlets and institutions as corporate members. Protest Letters SEEMO monitors press freedom in South East Europe and responds to threats and attacks on journalists and media outlets by sending protest letters to governments, inter-governmental organisations, but also companies or some political or other groups. These threats are often brought to SEEMO's attention by its members, many of whom experience such difficulties first-hand while carrying out their profession. Press Freedom Missions / Fact Finding Missions SEEMO leads missions to countries where press freedom is under threat, meeting with government officials, diplomats, journalists and non-governmental organisations, and providing legal representation and support in court cases. In 2009 SEEMO organised a press freedom Mission to Serbia, where the delegation met with Serbian Minister for Internal Affairs Ivica Dacic, as also more than 70 media representatives. In 2011 SEEMO organised a press freedom Mission to Croatia, where the group met with Croatian President Ivo Josipovic and more than 60 media representatives from Croatia, a press freedom missions to Montenegro (meeting with prime minister Igor Luksic and over 30 media representatives), Macedonia (meetings with president Gjorgje Ivanov and prime minister Nikola Gruevski and over 40 media representatives) and Kosovo (meetings with president of Kosovo Atifete Jahjaga and prime minister Hashim Tha√ßi and more than 50 media representatives). Missions in 2012: Serbia (in February 2012, meeting with Minister of Internal Affairs Ivica Dacic) and Bulgaria. In 2014 SEEMO was organising with IPI a press freedom mission to Slovenia and to Croatia, and in 2015 to Greece. SEEMO organised also three missions to Hungary, one mission to Slovakia and one mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additional SEEMO participated in several international press freedom missions, like four international missions to Turkey, two missions to Macedonia and two missions to Hungary. Press Freedom Webpages SEEMO started in 2010 the webpage Hungary Press Freedom (www.hungarypressfreedom.org) that follows the developments connected to the media regulations in Hungary, and in 2011 Turkey Press Freedom (www.turkeypressfreedom.org) that follows the media developments in Turkey, especially the state pressure on journalist in Turkey, as also www.macedoniapressfreedom.org (for North Macedonia) and www.belaruspressfreedom.org (for Belarus). Research SEEMO undertakes research on issues relevant to the media. Meetings Between January 2000 and 2012 (October), SEEMO has assembled over 14,000 editors-in-chief, media executives, leading journalists and public persons from the region in various meetings.

He is now the manager of the Frisco RoughRiders, AA affiliate of the Texas Rangers. The 5' 11\\" right- handed outfielder never rose above AAA baseball, but was a key player in the Tucson Toros' first Pacific Coast League championship in 1991. During 2007, his eighth season with the Tourists, Mikulik, who already held the team record for most games managed, became the team's all-time leader in managerial wins. Early life Mikulik attended Bishop Forest High School in Schulenburg, Texas with his brother John & Gene Mikulik, where he lettered in football, baseball, basketball and track and field. He went on to play 2 years at San Jacinto Jr. College where he would earn All-American award. In 1984, he was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 9th round in the winter draft. Through the 11-year playing career, there were many great moments. One of the highlights of his career happened on September 13, 1991: the recently promoted Mikulik, playing in the Pacific Coast League for the Championship, wearing wristbands emblazoned with the words \\"NEVER SURRENDER\\", drove in the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning in the final game of the league championship series between Tucson and the Calgary Cannons Team General Manager Mike Feder later remembered the game as \\"one of the best moments in Tucson baseball history.\\" He was again with the Toros when they won their second and final championship under that name in 1993. He finished his career as a player in Tucson in 1994, aside from one more stint in the Mexican League. Playing history Mikulik attended San Jacinto Junior College, where he was a walk-on and received a full scholarship. After an All-American sophomore season, Texas A&M; offered him a 2-year scholarship, but he signed with the Houston Astros after being drafted in the ninth round of the 1984 amateur draft. Mikulik‚Äôs biggest challenge came in his first year in the minors playing for Auburn Astros; Mikulik had a batting average of .200 and almost decided to quit the sport of baseball. It was Mikuluk‚Äôs friend and teammate, a center fielder of the Astros, who convinced Mikulik to stick with baseball. Mikulik‚Äôs batting average saw a sudden rise to .247. Over the next ten years he played for the Auburn Astros, the Asheville Tourists, the Columbus Astros and the Jackson Generals, all in the Astros' minor league system, supplemented with a stint in the Mexican League. From 1988 to 1992 he spent parts of each season with the AAA Tucson Toros, finally spending the entire season there in 1993. On September 13, 1991, the recently promoted Mikulik, wearing wristbands emblazoned with the words \\"NEVER SURRENDER\\", drove in the winning run, during the bottom of the ninth inning in the final game of the league championship series between Tucson and the Calgary Cannons. \\"It was a great thrill,\\" he told a reporter ten years later. \\"I was in the right place at the right time.\\" Team General Manager Mike Feder later remembered the game as \\"one of the best moments in Tucson baseball history.\\" He was again with the Toros when they won their second and final championship under that name in 1993. He finished his career as a player in Tucson in 1994, aside from one more stint in the Mexican League, where the new environment made him a stronger man. Mikulik came very close to joining the big leagues during his 11-year tenure in the minor leagues. Mikulik finished his career with a lifetime batting average of .279, 1265 career hits, 109 career home runs, 670 career RBIs, 161 stolen bases, and 742 runs. Played on 3 championship teams, 1986 AA Southern League Champion Columbus Astros, 1991 & 93 AAA Pacific Coast League Champion Tucson Toros. Coaching history After Mikulik retired from baseball he realized that he wanted to help other men achieve their dreams of reaching the major leagues. In 1995, Mikulik coached the Canton-Akron Indians, and rose to the position of manager with the Burlington Indians in August 1997. He became manager of his previous team, the Asheville Tourists, in 2000. Among his motivational tools for the latter team was a video called Running With the Toros, which is about the Toros' first championship season. Mikulik won his 800th game with the Asheville Tourists on May 17, 2011, against Lexington (Kentucky) and became the all-time leader in victories and games that he has managed. Mikulik is currently in his 12th season in Asheville and as of May 17, 2011 has posted a record of 800-757 (.513). Mikulik is a member of the South Atlantic League Hall of Fame and a three-time SAL Manager of the Year (2001, 2007 and 2008) leading the Tourists to three playoffs. Tourists assistant general manager Chris Smith was quoted in the Asheville‚Äôs Citizen Times ‚ÄúJoe winning 800 games with Asheville is an amazing accomplishment that we are all proud of. His being in Asheville for that long is so rare in minor league baseball, and it‚Äôs a testament to how much the (parent club Colorado) Rockies believe in Joe‚Äôs ability to develop young talent.‚Äù In 2012, Mikulik lead the Tourists to the South Atlantic League Championship. As Manager of the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, Mikulik had a widely reported tantrum in a game on August 17, 2014. After being ejected from the game, he removed some of his clothing while still on field.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2166705-minor-league-manager-adds-to- his-legacy-by-taking-off-his-clothes-after-ejection Meltdowns on the field Mikulik is well known for embarking on a lengthy tirade after being ejected from a game against the Lexington Legends on June 25, 2006. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Mikulik got into an argument over a Legends player, third baseman Koby Clemens, called safe after a close call at second base. Having had enough, the umpire proceeded to eject Mikulik from the game. Mikulik then went on an extended rant, pulling up the second base and throwing it into the field, throwing bats from the dugout on to the field, then finally pouring water on home plate before eventually leaving for the clubhouse, where he continued his tantrum unseen, toppling water coolers and a chair in front of the umpire's locker room.[4] The Legends went on to win the game. Afterward, Mikulik made several unapologetic comments, including the claim that \\"I could get two mannequins at Sears and umpire better than what I saw this whole series.\\"[4] As a result of his actions, Mikulik was given a seven-day suspension and $1,000 fine; Mikulik's antics were shown on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, ESPN's Pardon the Interruption, SportsCenter, and MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann. The meltdown was also profiled in the 2011 documentary film Legendary: When Baseball Came to the Bluegrass. Mikulik has described his coaching experience as, ‚ÄúLots of trial and error, just like life‚Äù. His career record stands at 868-838, a winning percentage of .509. Mikulik threw a similar tirade in a game against the Charleston RiverDogs on July 27, 2012. In the bottom of the first inning, Mikulik came out of the dugout to dispute a call that a base runner was safe by eluding a tag during a rundown. After a heated argument, Mikulik was ejected by an umpire after he kicked dirt and reenacted the play. Infuriated, Mikulik went back to argue with the umpiring crew and even removed third base before giving it to a fan. Mikulik left the game tipping his hat to the crowd as he received mixed applause. Players coached *Aaron Cook, pitcher *Ryan Spilborghs, outfielder *Ian Stewart, infielder (also his son-in-law) *Simon Ferrer, pitcher Ferrer describes Mikulik as the best manager he has ever had and was fun and enjoyable to be around. ‚ÄúPlaying with [Mikulik] is a blessing, [he] showed me a different way to look at baseball and how you can attribute it to everyday life. He loves teaching and spending times with others and brings out the best in his players. He motivates as well as knowing the game‚Äù. * Chris Iannetta, catcher When asked about his former coach, major leaguer Chris Iannetta described him as someone who ‚Äútreated and handled players well and motivated through his positive energy all year.‚Äù Iannetta believes his strongest qualities as a manager are his ‚Äúenergy, passion, and care for players‚Äù. Personal history Mikulik has two children, son Dawson and daughter Susan who is married to Ian Stewart who has two children, Ellsi Gray and Mila Rose. Joe married Candy Conway on October 13, 2014.

He served as Archbishop of Baltimore from 1961 to 1974 and was made a cardinal in 1965. His legacy as a Catholic prelate is noted for transferring priests accused of sexual abuse to new posts without disciplining them or warning parishioners. Early life and education Lawrence Shehan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Thomas Patrick and Anastasia Dames (n√©e Schofield) Shehan. His father operated a tailors' supply business. He received his early education at local parochial schools in Baltimore. In 1911, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. Charles College, a college seminary in Ellicott City. After graduating from St. Charles, Shehan enrolled at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore in 1917. He earned a B.A. in 1919 and a M.A. in 1920. In 1920, he was sent to continue his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Urban University, where he received a Doctor of Sacred Theology in 1923. Priesthood On December 23, 1922, Shehan was ordained a priest by Archbishop Giuseppe Palica at the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Following his return to the United States, he was first assigned as a curate at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., a post which he held until 1941. In addition to his pastoral duties, he served as assistant director (1929‚Äì36) and director (1936‚Äì45) of Catholic Charities in Washington. Shehan served as pastor of St. Patrick's Church from 1941 to 1945. During his pastorate, he ended racial segregation at the parochial school in 1942 and hosted the Washington branch of the Catholic Interracial Council. He was named a papal chamberlain in 1939, and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1945. Episcopacy =Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore= On November 17, 1945, Shehan was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Baltimore- Washington and titular bishop of Lydda by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 12 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Peter Leo Ireton and John Michael McNamara serving as co-consecrators. He was named pastor of SS. Philip and James Church in Baltimore in 1946. In 1947, when the Archdiocese of Washington was separated from Baltimore, Shehan was assigned to remain in Baltimore. He served as vicar general of the archdiocese from 1948 to 1953. =Bishop of Bridgeport= Shehan was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Bridgeport in Connecticut on August 25, 1953. His installation took place on December 2 of that year. During his tenure in Bridgeport, he established eighteen new parishes, built twenty-four new churches, and founded three high schools. He also formed a Catholic Youth Organization, promoted vocations to the priesthood and religious life, and began parish ministry for the increasing number of Hispanic, Portuguese, and Brazilian immigrants. In October 1960, he convoked the first synod of Bridgeport to complete the initial organization of the diocese and to establish a uniform code of practice and discipline for the clergy. A non-profit youth center in Bridgeport, CT is named after him (The Cardinal Shehan Center). On October 1, 2019, a report by former Connecticut state Judge Robert Holzberg accused Shehan and other former bishops of the diocese of transferring priests accused of sexual abuse rather than reporting them. =Archbishop of Baltimore= On July 10, 1961, Shehan returned to Baltimore as its Coadjutor Archbishop (with right of succession) and Titular Archbishop of Nicopolis ad Nestum. He succeeded Francis Patrick Keough as Archbishop of Baltimore on December 8 of that same year. In this position, he led the nation's first diocese and held precedence, except for Cardinals created earlier and without the honorary title of primacy, over the Church in America. After the Supreme Court ruled to remove prayer from public schools in 1962, Shehan warned that \\"secularization threatens to become a sort of state religion established by court decree\\".TIME Magazine. On Second Thought... August 24, 1962 He was also a strong advocate of civil rights, banning segregation in all of Baltimore's Catholic institutions and walking in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963.TIME Magazine.

Although it has a high salinity, it is considered the second largest lake in France. Description The √âtang de Thau seen from S√®te. The coastline between S√®te and Marseillan with the √âtang de Thau on the right. The √âtang de Thau during a sailing regatta. It is about 21 km long and 8 km wide, with an area of . The mean depth of the lagoon is 4.5 m, but in the central navigation channel it can be 10 m deep. Near Bouzigues there is a 100-metre diameter depression of 30 metres. This 'Fosse de la Vise' is the source of a hot spring that feeds the spa in Balaruc. Its size and depth, which distinguish it from other lagoons of the region, is explained by the geomorphology of the region: it is the syncline formed from folding which produced the corresponding anticline of the Gardiole in the north east. Until relatively recently the lagoons from Marseillan to the Rh√¥ne were a continuous stretch of inland waterway. Early settlers described this as \\"une petite mer int√©rieure et tranquille\\" (\\"a small sea, inner and quiet\\"). It provided access to, in particular, Marseillan‚Äîa fishing village that became a trade centre. Linked, now, by the Canal du Rh√¥ne √† S√®te to the river Rh√¥ne and by the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux via Toulouse, the lagoon also has access to the Mediterranean at S√®te. There is also a small canal (le canal des Allemands or the pisse-saume) that links the western end to the sea at Marseillan Plage. This canal is only suitable for small craft since both road and railway bridges restrict height. To the east, between Balaruc and S√®te, the borders of the lagoon are largely industrial. The south bank is formed by the coastal strip from S√®te to Cap d'Agde. The northern side has villages dedicated to fishing and the production of shellfish. There are harbours in the towns of Marseillan, M√®ze and Bouzigues, with smaller ports dedicated to shellfish on the northern shore. There is significant variation in the rainfall in the catchment basin for the lagoon, both seasonally and between years. The annual precipitation can range from 200 to 1,000 mm per year. As a result, the water temperature and salinity have extensive ranges. Water temperature ranges from 3 ¬∞C to 29 ¬∞C, with salinities of 27 psu to 40 psu. The salinity changes during the year with lows from February to June and peaks in July to January. Administration Located between the towns of S√®te and Marseillan in the H√©rault d√©partement, the √âtang de Thau is shared administratively by the communes of (running clockwise): Balaruc-le-Vieux, Balaruc-les-Bains, Frontignan, S√®te, Marseillan, M√®ze, Loupian and Bouzigues. Economy and natural resources As the lagoon is open to the sea, it has fish such as the gilt-head bream (dorade), Argyrosomus regius (a croaker) and sea bass. The lagoon produces approximately 200 kg/ha/year of fish. However, the shellfish industry is more economically important. Eighteen varieties of shellfish are taken from the lagoon - the most important being oysters. 750 producers farm 2,750 oyster tables and take some 13,000 tonnes annually. This provides for about 8.5% of France's consumption. Oysters from the √âtang de Thau are marketed under the name hu√Ætres de Bouzigues (Bouzigues Oysters) after the village of Bouzigues where oyster production started. They are a flat variety. Fixed with cement to ropes, the young oysters are immersed in the water until they reach a size suitable for consumption. Thau water is graded A and so shellfish can be caught and consumed within minutes. In addition to oysters, some 3,000 tonnes of mussels are produced every year. Apart from fishing and shellfish, the √âtang de Thau provides income through tourism, particularly via sailing schools. Wildlife Flamingos near Bouzigues The Bassin de Thau provides a habitat for a variety of wild animals, notably birds such as herons and pink flamingos and a rich marine fauna, including bivalves (oysters and mussels), jellyfish, fish, and algae. Periodically in the spring and summer, the Thau Lagoon has algae blooms of Alexandrium catenella which sometimes reach such high levels that it results in contamination of the lagoon's bivalves with algae toxins.

It was elevated to the Archbishopric of Regensburg in 1803 after the dissolution of the Archbishopric of Mainz. The Prince-Bishopric of Regensburg must not be confused with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Regensburg, which was considerably larger. History The diocese was founded in 739 by Saint Boniface; it was originally subordinate to the archbishop of Salzburg. In the 13th century, the bishop of Regensburg became a prince of the Holy Roman Empire with seat and vote at the Imperial Diet. Being fully enclaved within the powerful Duchy of Bavaria, the prince-bishopric was not able to expand territorially and remained one of the smallest of the Empire. In the course of the German mediatization of 1803, the prince-bishopric was united with the Free Imperial city of Regensburg and other territories to form the Archbishopric of Regensburg, with Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg as archbishop. In 1810, the Principality of Regensburg became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, although it retained archiepiscopal status. This was after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the War of the Third Coalition. The Bavarian Concordat of 1817 following Dalberg's death downgraded the Archdiocese of Regensburg into a suffragan diocese subordinate to the archbishop of Munich and Freising.

Created with the consolidation of the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad and the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad in 1869, the ETV&G; played an important role in connecting East Tennessee and other isolated parts of Southern Appalachia with the rest of the country, and helped make Knoxville one of the region's major wholesaling centers. In 1894, the ETV&G; merged with the Richmond and Danville Railroad to form the Southern Railway.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 100-111, 226-231. While efforts to establish a railroad in East Tennessee began in the 1830s, financial difficulties stalled construction until the late 1840s. The East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad was built between 1847 and 1859, connecting Knoxville, Tennessee, with Dalton, Georgia.Interstate Commerce Commission. Southern Ry.

Knoxville financier Charles McClung McGhee formed a syndicate which purchased both lines to form the ETV&G; in 1869, and largely through McGhee's efforts, the new ETV&G; bought out numerous other rail lines across the region. By 1890, the ETV&G; controlled over of tracks in five states.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 192-199. Predecessor lines Throughout the first half of the 19th century, East Tennessee struggled to overcome the economic isolation created by its natural barriers, namely the Blue Ridge Mountains on the south and east and the Cumberland Plateau on the north and west. Shortly after the advent of railroads in the 1820s, the region's business leaders began discussing railroad construction as a way to relieve this isolation. In the mid-1830s, several businessmen, among them Knoxville physician J. G. M. Ramsey, planned and promoted a line connecting Cincinnati and Charleston (which would have passed through East Tennessee), but the Panic of 1837 doomed this initiative. In 1836, a group of businessmen chartered the Hiwassee Railroad, based in Athens, Tennessee, which sought to construct a line from Knoxville southward to Dalton, Georgia, where it would join a planned extension of the Charleston and Hamburg line, providing Knoxville with a link to the Atlantic Coast. Like its competitors with the Cincinnati and Charleston, the Hiwassee ran into financial difficulties, and the Hiwassee Company nearly collapsed. The company was forced to focus on turnpike construction and iron production to survive. Depot in Niota, Tennessee, built in 1854 by the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad In 1844, the Charleston and Hamburg extension to Dalton was completed, and Knoxville and Athens businessmen again entertained the idea of building a rail line to Georgia. The Hiwassee Company was recharted in 1847 as the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad, and with renewed support from the Tennessee state legislature, work on the line began the following year. By 1852, the line had reached Blair's Ferry (modern Loudon, Tennessee), just southeast of Knoxville. On June 22, 1855, the first train rolled into Knoxville over the East Tennessee and Georgia's tracks. On July 4, 1855, as Knoxvillians celebrated the arrival of the railroad, track work began on the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, which sought to connect Knoxville with Bristol, Tennessee, where it would join existing tracks to create an unbroken rail line from New York to Memphis. Under the direction of Jonesborough physician Samuel B. Cunningham, this line reached New Market in 1856. After overcoming financial and engineering difficulties, the tracks from Knoxville to Bristol were completed on May 14, 1858, with Cunningham personally driving the last spike. During the 1850s, virtually every major business and political leader in Knoxville was involved in railroad building. In 1852, congressmen Horace Maynard, William Montgomery Churchwell, and John H. Crozier, along with attorney Oliver Perry Temple and minister Thomas William Humes, chartered the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad, which planned to build a line northward into Kentucky, where it would join existing lines to Cincinnati and Louisville. By the outbreak of the Civil War, however, this company had laid just nine miles of track. Civil War The railroads in East Tennessee provided a major supply route between Virginia and the Deep South, and thus both Confederate and Union forces considered the region of vital importance. On November 8, 1861, East Tennessee Union loyalists destroyed five railroad bridges, forcing the Confederate government to invoke martial law in the region. Throughout the war, both Confederate and Union forces destroyed railroad tracks and facilities to prevent them from falling under the other's control.

In 1869, the two lines were consolidated to form the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad, with Thomas Calloway as president, and McGhee and Richard T. Wilson as agents. As a nexus between northern financiers and local interests, McGhee was able to obtain for the ETV&G; large amounts of capital, and the new company rapidly expanded. Charles McClung McGhee In 1869, the ETV&G; bought the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad, which had been revived after the war, and over the subsequent decade extended its tracks to the Kentucky state line at Jellico. During this same period, the ETV&G; acquired the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, which connected Memphis and Chattanooga, the Georgia Southern Railroad, which connected Dalton with Rome, Georgia, and the Macon and Brunswick Railroad, which connected Macon, Georgia, with Brunswick, Georgia on the Atlantic Coast.

He was on death row between 1980 and 2008, and his case generated discussion about the appropriateness of the death penalty for offenders who are thought to be intellectually disabled. Penry's case went twice to the United States Supreme Court: Penry v. Lynaugh (1989) found that executing intellectually disabled persons is not cruel and unusual punishment; Penry v. Johnson (2001) found that the jury's instructions regarding mitigating factors were incomplete and that Penry should be re-sentenced. Prosecutors reached a plea agreement with him in 2008 under which he was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. Early life Penry sustained brain damage at birth related to complications from breech positioning. His mother suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.Hall, p. 342. One of Penry's siblings said that their mother would threaten to cut off Penry's genitalia and had forced him to drink his own urine and eat his own feces. \\"We were all abused, but he was abused the worst,\\" his sister said. Penry did not attend school past the first grade. Arrests In 1977, Penry was convicted of rape and sentenced to five years in prison; he was released from prison in the summer of 1979 after serving two years for that crime. Penry found work delivering appliances. In October 1979, he raped and killed a young woman by stabbing her with a pair of scissors. The victim, Pamela Moseley Carpenter, had received an appliance delivery from Penry a few weeks before the crime. Penry had been out of prison for three months at the time of the murder. Carpenter, 22 years old when she died, was the younger sister of National Football League kicker Mark Moseley. On Oct 25, 1979, Penry broke into Carpenter's house and stabbed her with a pair of scissors she had been using to make a Halloween costume for her niece. He then beat and raped her before leaving her for dead. Carpenter eventually died from internal bleeding, but lived long enough to call a friend and provide a description of suspect as she was being transported to a hospital in an ambulance.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1979/11/09/a-plea-for- justice/75ac48dd-2c33-4d31-9302-599446209aef/ Penry was arrested by police on the same day. Penry was sentenced to death on April 9, 1980. Appeals and U.S. Supreme Court rulings By 1989, Penry's appeals reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In Penry v. Lynaugh, the court held that the execution of intellectually disabled offenders did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but it overturned Penry's death sentence, holding that Texas laws on jury instructions had not allowed jurors in his Penry's case to adequately consider intellectual disability as mitigating evidence during the punishment phase of his trial.Hall, pp. 347-348. Penry was retried in 1990 and again sentenced to the death penalty. In 2001, Penry's 1990 conviction was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Penry v. Johnson, the court ruled, by a 6-3 majority, that the judge presiding over the 1990 trial had given inadequate instructions to the jury in terms of how they should weigh the concerns about Penry's mental impairment when deciding his punishment. Subsequent legal proceedings In 2002, Polk County district judge Elizabeth Coker removed his longtime defense attorney, John Wright, from his case. Coker ruled that Wright's continued work on the case might represent a conflict of interest if Penry were to advance an argument of ineffective legal counsel. The judge had previously declared Penry competent to stand trial, but she questioned whether he was able to comprehend an affidavit he signed that said he wanted Wright to continue to represent him. Coker appointed Stephen C. Taylor to replace Wright as Penry's defense attorney. Prosecutors had earlier consulted with Taylor about how to present arguments that Penry was competent to stand trial. Coker's ruling was criticized by legal ethics expert Stephen Gillers, who said, \\"This is imaginary law. This is not real-world law. This is Alice in Wonderland law.\\" Wright later returned as Penry's attorney. In October 2005, Penry's third death sentence was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the grounds that the jury may not have adequately considered Penry's claims of mental impairment. In the summer of 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate that sentence. Wright said that Penry's IQ was between 50 and 60; an IQ of 70 is used as the threshold for intellectual impairment. Prosecutors remained convinced that Penry was not intellectually impaired, pointing to two television interview clips that had been shown at one of his trials. Prosecutor William Hon said that Penry spoke normally on one tape but \\"like Elmer Fudd\\" on the other. \\"It was the most contrived performance you've ever seen in your life,\\" Hon said. He said that Penry was a sociopath and that he had only been sent to a home for the intellectually disabled because he had been such an uncontrollable child. Plea agreement On February 15, 2008, Penry agreed to a plea bargain in which he was given three consecutive sentences of life without parole for Carpenter's murder and sexual assault. As part of the plea deal, Penry had to certify that he was not intellectually disabled. Prosecutors did not want to risk putting Penry through a fourth trial. The district attorney most familiar with the case had died in 2003, and if the fourth jury did not hand down a death sentence, Penry would have served enough time to be eligible for parole immediately under 1970s laws governing life sentences in Texas. After the deal was reached, Carpenter's niece, Ellen May, said she was happy that Penry would remain in prison forever and she said the agreement proved that Penry had been lying about being intellectually disabled. Wright said that it was \\"galling\\" for prosecutors to require Penry to say that he was not intellectually disabled, but he characterized the stipulation as \\"a small price to pay\\" for eliminating the possibility of execution.

His family business, the Rosefield Packing Company, was based in Alameda. His new production process was licensed to another company to make Peter Pan peanut butter in 1923. Rosefield Packing later marketed Skippy peanut butter in 1932; both brands are still sold today. It also introduced cylindrical \\"wide-mouth\\" jars for peanut butter in 1935. Peanut butter then became a vast food industry. Among other roles, Rosefield Packing provided emergency supplies of peanut butter to Hawaii during World War II. Rosefield's family sold Rosefield Packing and the Skippy brand to Best Foods in 1955. Forms of peanut butter were already popular before Rosefield's innovation. The problem was that the oil separated from the peanut grit and did not keep. Rosefield's patented homogenization solution was to partially hydrogenate the peanut oil to make it more miscible with the peanuts. (In other words, he added vegetable shortening to his recipe.) This also made it possible to churn the peanut butter to a creamy consistency. His company promised a one-year shelf life for the product and claimed that it tasted better and was less sticky than previous formulas.

The working title of Banks' earlier novel The Steep Approach to Garbadale was also Matter.  Synopsis  The book follows the experiences of three members of the royal household of the Sarl, a feudal, early-industrial humanoid race living on the eighth level of the Shellworld of Sursamen. Constructed for an unknown purpose by a long-dead race called the Veil, Shellworlds are ancient artificial planets consisting of nested concentric spheres internally lit by tiny thermonuclear \\"stars\\". The spheres are inhabited by various primitive races along with progressively more advanced mentoring species, up to the level of what the Sarl call \\"Optimae.\\" (The Optimae themselves, particularly the Culture, prefer the term \\"Involved.\\") Approximately 4,000 Shellworlds were built, but almost 2,000 were deliberately destroyed, for reasons unknown, by another presumed extinct race, the Iln. Like many Shellwords, the core of Sursamen is known to be inhabited by a mysterious creature called a Xinthian Tensile Aeranothaur, whom the Sarl worship as their \\"WorldGod.\\" Prince Ferbin, the self-centred heir to the Sarl throne, has to flee his home level on the Shellworld and the Shellworld itself after witnessing the murder of his father, King Hausk, by Mertis tyl Loesp, the King's second-in-command. Prince Oramen, Ferbin's studious younger brother, is unaware of the treachery and trusts tyl Loesp fully. After Ferbin's disappearance‚Äîand presumed death‚Äîtyl Loesp takes on the role of regent, ostensibly until Prince Regent Oramen comes of age and can be crowned king. The Oct, the direct mentoring species over the human Sarl, meanwhile have been organizing the takeover of the ninth level of Sursamen (owned by the Deldeyn, another human nation of approximately equal level of development to the Sarl), using the Sarl royal court and military as their pawns. It becomes increasingly clear that they are searching for something hidden in the Nameless City, a metropolis buried under several hundred million years of sediment which is currently being stripped away by the giant Hyeng-zhar waterfalls. The ninth level was only recently re- colonised in a move by the Oct, which was retrospectively validated, with reluctance, by Sursamen's mentoring races, the Nariscene and the more senior Morthanveld. (The Culture itself has no jurisdiction over Sursamen, since the Morthanveld are - like the Culture - \\"High Level Involved\\", technically regarded as sort-of-equals in an uneasy although peaceful diplomatic relationship: although despite this, the human(oid) Sarl seem to have more affinity with the Culture although their hierarchy of patronage comes from the Morthanveld.) Opposed to the Oct at an approximately equal stage of development are another species, the Aultridia, who opposed the Oct's incursions into the ninth level, and there is a risk of Oct/Aultridia war breaking out - which may become worse if the intermediate-level Nariscene, themselves patrons of the Oct, are dragged into involvement, or worse still, the high-level Morthanveld themselves. Elsewhere, Djan Seriy Anaplian, another child of King Hausk, had left Sursamen fifteen years earlier to become a member of the Culture as part of a cultural exchange and later joined the Culture's covert Special Circumstances (SC) intelligence and intervention organisation. Anaplian decides to return to Sursamen, originally to pay her respects to her dead father and presumed-dead brother. (Initial reports from Sursamen only described the king and prince's causes of death as combat related.) Meanwhile, the fleeing Ferbin is seeking out his long-absent sister hoping that, with her powerful connections and SC access, she could help install him as rightful king of the Sarl. Within the Culture, other channels of intelligence later validate suspicions that the Oct are planning something mysterious on Sursamen and SC contacts Anaplian en route via a humanoid avatar of the Culture ship Liveware Problem, Klatsli Quike. SC asks Anaplian to investigate, upgrading her bereavement travel to an official Culture mission - one which will be necessarily highly sensitive since Sursamen is not under Culture jurisdiction, nor are any of the species involved in the Morthanveld chain of patronage. Quike is soon replaced by another avatoid of The Liveware Problem, Pone Hippinse, as Anaplian's tactical partner in the mission. Her rather irritable combat drone, Turminder Xuss, had stowed away in her belongings at the beginning of her journey, disguised initially as a Knife Missile resembling a dildo; Anaplian has had most SC tactical enhancements to her mind and body disabled for her personal journey out of diplomatic considerations, but she restores most of them, and Xuss will prove critically useful. At this point, Anaplian is reunited with her fugitive brother, Ferbin, and his faithful (but increasingly independently minded) servant Choubris Holse. Arriving at Sursamen on board the Liveware Problem, the team (Anaplian, Hippinse, Ferbin, Holse and Xuss) successfully infiltrate their way down to the Shellworld's ninth level to confront tyl Loesp, and protect their brother, Prince Oramen, both of whom are overseeing the excavation of the Nameless City. By the time the team arrives, Oramen has survived assassination attempts by tyl Loesp, but has been killed by a mysterious and powerful entity long entombed in the ancient ruins. Oramen had discovered‚Äîtoo late‚Äîthat the entity is a ruthless machine created by or belonging to the long-dead race known as the Iln. The liberated Iln machine's nature is a horrible surprise to the Sarl humans and especially the Oct, who thought that they were excavating one of the \\"Involucra\\" (aka the Veil) who had originally built the shellworlds and from whom they claim to be descended. The Iln entity kills all nearby Sarl and Octs - including both Oramen and tyl Loesp - with a small thermonuclear explosion‚Äîafter thanking them for their help‚Äîand heads towards the core of the Shellworld, planning to capture the Xinthian \\"WorldGod\\" and then destroy Sursamen by generating and detonating antimatter. With both tyl Loesp and their brother dead on the ninth level, Anaplian and Ferbin descend towards the Shellworld's core level with the rest of the team, equipped with intelligent SC-technology combat suits. The Liveware Problem itself speeds down a vast shaft into the Shellworld's interior to lead the team, but sustains substantial damage from Nariscene weapons during its descent to the core (it becoming increasingly apparent that all the various species involved have been getting their hands on technology from at least one level higher up the chain). The team is thus outgunned by the Iln device, which has taken over a Morthanveld guard ship and twelve other drones secretly emplaced in the core. Xuss is MIA. Hippinse's parent ship, the Liveware Problem, disposes of all but two of the Morthanveld drones then sacrifices itself in a suicide attack on the hijacked Morthanveld guard ship. Hippinse himself is killed eliminating one of the remaining drones; Anaplian accounts for the last one, but the Iln entity remains too strong for the remaining compatriots, whose resources are seriously depleted. Ferbin sacrifices himself to the Iln machine and is killed outright, but satisfies the enemy that the humans are not dangerous and permits Anaplian a much closer approach. Despite her advanced armour, she is eviscerated beyond the point where a non-SC enhanced human would be dead, but she remains conscious enough to detonate the tiny grain of antimatter in her skull that provided power to her SC-enhanced body, destroying the Iln entity and saving the Shellworld. In the epilogue, Holse, the lone survivor of the Iln encounter, rejoins his family after a long absence, accompanied by the surviving Liveware Problem avatoid, Quike. He declares his intention to become a political leader of a no-longer-monarchist Sarl, with the secret backing of the Culture.

The lines with the arrows show the direction of the contracting and expanding eigenspaces In mathematics, Arnold's cat map is a chaotic map from the torus into itself, named after Vladimir Arnold, who demonstrated its effects in the 1960s using an image of a cat, hence the name. Thinking of the torus \\\\mathbb{T}^2 as the quotient space \\\\mathbb{R}^2/\\\\mathbb{Z}^2, Arnold's cat map is the transformation \\\\Gamma : \\\\mathbb{T}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{T}^2 given by the formula :\\\\Gamma \\\\, : \\\\, (x,y) \\\\to (2x+y,x+y) \\\\bmod 1. Equivalently, in matrix notation, this is :\\\\Gamma \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\bmod 1 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\bmod 1. That is, with a unit equal to the width of the square image, the image is sheared one unit up, then two units to the right, and all that lies outside that unit square is shifted back by the unit until it is within the square. Properties * Œì is invertible because the matrix has determinant 1 and therefore its inverse has integer entries, * Œì is area preserving, * Œì has a unique hyperbolic fixed point (the vertices of the square). The linear transformation which defines the map is hyperbolic: its eigenvalues are irrational numbers, one greater and the other smaller than 1 (in absolute value), so they are associated respectively to an expanding and a contracting eigenspace which are also the stable and unstable manifolds. The eigenspace are orthogonal because the matrix is symmetric. Since the eigenvectors have rationally independent components both the eigenspaces densely cover the torus. Arnold's cat map is a particularly well-known example of a hyperbolic toral automorphism, which is an automorphism of a torus given by a square unimodular matrix having no eigenvalues of absolute value 1. * The set of the points with a periodic orbit is dense on the torus. Actually a point is preperiodic if and only if its coordinates are rational. * Œì is topologically transitive (i.e. there is a point whose orbit is dense, this happens for any points on the expanding eigenspace) * The number of points with period n is exactly \\\\lambda_1^n+\\\\lambda_2^n-2 (where \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix). For example, the first few terms of this series are 1, 5, 16, 45, 121, 320, 841, 2205 .... (The same equation holds for any unimodular hyperbolic toral automorphism if the eigenvalues are replaced.) * Œì is ergodic and mixing, * Œì is an Anosov diffeomorphism and in particular it is structurally stable.  The discrete cat map  From order to chaos and back. Sample mapping on a picture of 150x150 pixels. The number shows the iteration step; after 300 iterations, the original image returns. Sample mapping on a picture of a pair of cherries. The image is 74 pixels wide, and takes 114 iterations to be restored, although it appears upside-down at the halfway point (the 57th iteration). It is possible to define a discrete analogue of the cat map. One of this map's features is that image being apparently randomized by the transformation but returning to its original state after a number of steps. As can be seen in the adjacent picture, the original image of the cat is sheared and then wrapped around in the first iteration of the transformation. After some iterations, the resulting image appears rather random or disordered, yet after further iterations the image appears to have further order‚Äîghost-like images of the cat, multiple smaller copies arranged in a repeating structure and even upside-down copies of the original image‚Äîand ultimately returns to the original image. The discrete cat map describes the phase space flow corresponding to the discrete dynamics of a bead hopping from site qt (0 ‚â§ qt < N) to site qt+1 on a circular ring with circumference N, according to the second order equation: :q_{t+1} - 3q_t + q_{t-1} = 0 \\\\mod N Defining the momentum variable pt = qt ‚àí qt‚àí1, the above second order dynamics can be re-written as a mapping of the square 0 ‚â§ q, p < N (the phase space of the discrete dynamical system) onto itself: :q_{t+1} = 2q_{t} + p_t \\\\mod N :p_{t+1} = q_{t} + p_t \\\\mod N This Arnold cat mapping shows mixing behavior typical for chaotic systems. However, since the transformation has a determinant equal to unity, it is area-preserving and therefore invertible the inverse transformation being: :q_{t-1} = q_t - p_t \\\\mod N :p_{t-1} = -q_t + 2p_t \\\\mod N For real variables q and p, it is common to set N = 1. In that case a mapping of the unit square with periodic boundary conditions onto itself results. When N is set to an integer value, the position and momentum variables can be restricted to integers and the mapping becomes a mapping of a toroidial square grid of points onto itself. Such an integer cat map is commonly used to demonstrate mixing behavior with Poincar√© recurrence utilising digital images. The number of iterations needed to restore the image can be shown never to exceed 3N. For an image, the relationship between iterations could be expressed as follows: : \\\\begin{array}{rrcl} n=0: \\\\quad & T^0 (x,y) &= & \\\\text{Input Image}(x,y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ n=1: \\\\quad & T^1 (x,y) &= & T^0 \\\\left( \\\\bmod(2x+y, N), \\\\bmod(x+y, N) \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & &\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ n=k: \\\\quad & T^k (x,y) &= & T^{k-1} \\\\left( \\\\bmod(2x+y, N), \\\\bmod(x+y, N) \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & &\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ n=m: \\\\quad & \\\\text{Output Image}(x,y) &=& T^m (x,y) \\\\end{array} See also * List of chaotic maps * Recurrence plot References ; English translation: External links Effect of randomisation of initial conditions on recurrence time * Arnold's Cat Map by Enrique Zeleny, The Wolfram Demonstrations Project. *Arnold's Cat Map: An interactive graphical exploration Chaotic maps Exactly solvable models ","title":"Arnold's cat map"},{"id":"5732085","text":"rooArt was an Australian independent record label, founded in 1988 by INXS's then-manager, Chris Murphy.

Other bands which made early or first releases on the rooArt label included Hipslingers, The Last Metro, The Lab, The Fauves, Bellicose and Custard. rooArt released a series of three compilation albums of new or then-unsigned acts, called Youngblood. A number of acts released on the compilations went on to record their own albums, including Tall Tales and True, The Trilobites and Martha's Vineyard. Sydney band Crash Politics were the first band signed to rooArt, which released their debut album Mothers' Intention. The label's second signing was The Hummingbirds , who had released four singles on their previous label Phantom Records, with their debut LP loveBUZZ being one of the first hit albums for rooArt. The label had a sub-branch called Ra Records, whose focus was on alternative rock; You Am I, Augie March, The Mark Of Cain, The Mandelbrot Set (band) and Buffalo Tom were signed to this. It also had a section called rooArt Jazz, which released an album by Free Spirits in 1990. rooArt releases were distributed PolyGram until 1991, then by Warner Music Australia, until 1995 when the label switched to the independent Shock Records label to manage its marketing and distribution. In October 1996, on the eve of You Am I's triumph at the ARIA Awards, it was announced that BMG Australia had purchased rooArt for A$5 million.

Between 1947 and 1955, he occupied senior administrative positions in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and in 1951 he became 'directeur de cabinet' at the ministry. Between 1948 and 1955, Dreyfus combined his civil service duties with the vice-presidency of the newly nationalised Renault auto business. On 11 February 1955 Pierre Lefaucheux died in a road accident and Dreyfus was appointed CEO of Renault. He retained the position until his retirement from the company in 1975. Like Lefaucheux, Dreyfus secured his reputation in the top job at Renault by overseeing the launch and production of a model developed under his predecessor: in this case the commercial success was that of the Renault Dauphine. By the end of 1958, with Dreyfus less than three years into his time at the top, a million Renault 4CVs and half a million Dauphines had been sold. The following year, 1959, Renault ranked as the world's sixth largest auto-maker. The collapse of North American demand for the Dauphine triggered a crisis for the company that was well-publicised, especially in the United States, with unsold Dauphines on North American docksides adding to the half million unsold Detroit built products clogging the US auto-market by the end of 1960: for Renault salvation arrived just in time in the form of the Renault 4, developed under Dreyfus and built at the rate of 1,000 cars a day by the end of 1962. During Dreyfus's twenty years in charge, Renault went on to consolidate its position as France's top selling car maker, gaining particular recognition in the 1960s for popularizing front wheel drive, hatchback sedans across Europe, most notably the 4, 5 and 16 models. During the early years of the Mitterrand presidency, Dreyfus became active on the political scene, serving briefly as Industry Minister between June 1981 and June 1982 under prime minister Pierre Mauroy. Pierre Dreyfus was not related either to Alfred Dreyfus, famous because of the 'Dreyfus Affair' effectively publicised by √âmile Zola, nor to the race-driver Pierre Louis- Dreyfus.

It is located at 10 East 71st Street (between Madison and Fifth Avenue) in New York City. The library is housed in a six-story building designed by the architect John Russell Pope. History Helen Clay Frick founded the Frick Art Reference Library in 1920 as a memorial to her father, Henry Clay Frick, who died in 1919. Its first home was the bowling alley of the Frick residence, which is now The Frick Collection. In 1924, the library moved from the bowling alley to a one-story building at 6 East 71st Street, designed by the architecture firm, Carr√®re and Hastings. The library opened to the public in its current building on January 14, 1935. Mission The Frick Art Reference Library is open to visitors 16 years of age or older. In addition, it serves the greater art and art history research community through its membership in the New York Art Resources Consortium, which also includes the libraries of the Brooklyn Museum and The Museum of Modern Art. The library established the Center for the History of Collecting in 2007. The center supports the study of the formation of collections of fine and decorative arts, both public and private, from Colonial times to the present through its fellowships, symposia, and publications. Collections The collections held at the Frick Art Reference Library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century (A.D.) to the mid twentieth century (A.D.), and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials augment its research collections.Archival materials The Library holds more than 228,000 monograph and 3,300 periodical titles. The collection includes several highlights: an auction catalog collection that contains approximately 90,000 items; the Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive which holds more than 1.2 million images including photographs and clippings of works of art; and the electronic resources collection which consists of more than 2,000 subscription databases and e-journals, as well as e-books.

The concept applies mainly to user acceptance aspects. The amount of time an application takes to start up, or a file to download, is not made faster by showing a startup screen (see Splash screen) or a file progress dialog box. However, it satisfies some human needs: it appears faster to the user as well as providing a visual cue to let them know the system is handling their request. In most cases, increasing real performance increases perceived performance, but when real performance cannot be increased due to physical limitations, techniques can be used to increase perceived performance at the cost of marginally decreasing real performance. For example, drawing and refreshing a progress bar while loading a file satisfies the user who is watching, but steals time from the process that is actually loading the file, but usually this is only a very small amount of time. All such techniques must exploit the inability of the user to accurately judge real performance, or they would be considered detrimental to performance. Techniques for improving perceived performance may include more than just decreasing the delay between the user's request and visual feedback. Sometimes an increase in delay can be perceived as a performance improvement, such as when a variable controlled by the user is set to a running average of the users input. This can give the impression of smoother motion, but the controlled variable always reaches the desired value a bit late. Since it smooths out hi-frequency jitter, when the user is attempting to hold the value constant, they may feel like they are succeeding more readily. This kind of compromise would be appropriate for control of a sniper rifle in a video game. Another example may be doing trivial computation ahead of time rather than after a user triggers an action, such as pre-sorting a large list of data before a user wants to see it. A technique to measure and interpret perceived performance remote systems is shown in a 2003Perceived Performance and updated in 2005 for virtual machines.Perceived Performance and Virtual Operating Systems  Web Performance  For Web Performance optimization, perceived performance plays an important role. It tricks the user into thinking a site loads faster than it actually is. To achieve that, render-blocking resources will be loaded last in order to let the browser render the other elements first: like text content, images. In this way, even though the browser loads the same elements, by loading the non-blocking resources first, the user starts to see some content immediately. This trick improves the perceived performance, improving the overall user experience. Here are the main perceived performance steps for better user experiences: Minimize initial page load Load only the resources you need in order to display the first content seen by the user. After these resources are loaded, the rest of the resources can be loaded. Interactive elements should be available Elements that are interactive, that the user can click on or interact with, should be able to perform those actions as soon as possible. Even with the rest of the page being still loaded, if the user can interact faster with the page, the user will perceive the site as being fast. Avoid rendering elements that can cause flicker on screen Elements like fonts or content that takes longer to load should be avoided as much as possible. When loading fonts, try to adjust their size and appearance closer to the default browser styles. In this way, when the font will be loaded, the switch won't look weird and be obvious. For images, charts, or embedded content, make sure you have a placeholder that has the same with and height. In this way when the content comes, the screen won't flicker and the height of the page won't change. = Tools = In order to improve the perceived performance of a web page, there are numerous tools that can be helpful: Google Chrome: DevTools provides ways to measure the performance of a site giving you insights on how to improve.

Martin was educated at this canonry, and after the death of his father, Martin decided to undertake a major pilgrimage, visiting the cities of Rome and Constantinople. Returning to Spain, he took the religious habit at St. Marcellinus, but after seeing this monastery had been secularized by the bishops he entered the collegiate of church St. Isidore in the same city. This is a church he went on to endow and is where Saint Isidore was buried, hence its name. Martin distinguished himself by his zealous observance, his charity, and his deep devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. The date of his death is given to us by the necrology preserved in the monastery. He died on January 12, 1203 of natural causes. The religious of St. Isidore's dedicated a chapel to Martin very early and celebrated his feast each year.  Works  Martin wrote commentaries on different Epistles and the Apocalypse, and he left numerous discourses on the many varied subjects.

He was the engine of the theoretical research on the area of Generalized nets, and promoted much of the applied research. He has defined a lot of operations and relations over generalized nets, part of which have analogues in the theory of ordinary Petri nets. However, the topological and logical operators he has introduced have no analogue in Petri nets theory. = Intuitionistic fuzzy sets = The other fundamental field of research interest for Atanassov are Fuzzy sets, defined by Lotfi Zadeh, which he significantly extended by launching the concept of \\"Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets\\" and investigated their basis properties. He has also initiated the applications of Intuitionistic fuzzy sets in expert systems, systems theory, decision making and others. He has studied and defined a lot of operations and relations over intuitionistic fuzzy sets, part of which have analogues in the theory of fuzzy sets. Without analogues in traditional fuzzy set theory are the operators on modal, topological, level, which Atanassov introduced and researched. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are also often referred to in the literature as \\"Atanassov fuzzy sets\\" or \\"Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets\\".

MUSCL stands for Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (van Leer, 1979), and the term was introduced in a seminal paper by Bram van Leer (van Leer, 1979). In this paper he constructed the first high-order, total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme where he obtained second order spatial accuracy. The idea is to replace the piecewise constant approximation of Godunov's scheme by reconstructed states, derived from cell- averaged states obtained from the previous time-step. For each cell, slope limited, reconstructed left and right states are obtained and used to calculate fluxes at the cell boundaries (edges). These fluxes can, in turn, be used as input to a Riemann solver, following which the solutions are averaged and used to advance the solution in time. Alternatively, the fluxes can be used in Riemann-solver-free schemes, which are basically Rusanov-like schemes. Linear reconstruction 1D advective equation u_t+u_x=0, with step wave propagating to the right. Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon a first order upwind spatial discretization scheme. We will consider the fundamentals of the MUSCL scheme by considering the following simple first-order, scalar, 1D system, which is assumed to have a wave propagating in the positive direction, :u_t + F_x\\\\left(u \\\\right)=0. \\\\, Where u represents a state variable and F represents a flux variable. The basic scheme of Godunov uses piecewise constant approximations for each cell, and results in a first-order upwind discretisation of the above problem with cell centres indexed as i. A semi-discrete scheme can be defined as follows, :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} u_i}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ F \\\\left( u_{i} \\\\right) - F \\\\left( u_{i-1} \\\\right) \\\\right] =0. This basic scheme is not able to handle shocks or sharp discontinuities as they tend to become smeared. An example of this effect is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates a 1D advective equation with a step wave propagating to the right. The simulation was carried out with a mesh of 200 cells and used a 4th order Runge‚ÄìKutta time integrator (RK4). To provide higher resolution of discontinuities, Godunov's scheme can be extended to use piecewise linear approximations of each cell, which results in a central difference scheme that is second-order accurate in space. The piecewise linear approximations are obtained from : u \\\\left( x \\\\right) = u_{i} + \\\\frac{\\\\left( x - x_{i} \\\\right) }{ \\\\left( x_{i+1} - x_{i} \\\\right)} \\\\left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\forall x \\\\in (x_{i}, x_{i+1}]. Thus, evaluating fluxes at the cell edges we get the following semi-discrete scheme :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} u_i}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ F \\\\left( u_{i + 1/2} \\\\right) - F \\\\left( u_{i - 1/2} \\\\right) \\\\right] =0, 1D advective equation u_t+u_x=0, with step wave propagating to the right. Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon a second order, central difference spatial discretization scheme. where u_{i + 1/2} and u_{i - 1/2} are the piecewise approximate values of cell edge variables, i.e., : u_{i + 1/2} = 0.5 \\\\left( u_{i} + u_{i + 1} \\\\right), : u_{i - 1/2} = 0.5 \\\\left( u_{i-1} + u_{i} \\\\right). Although the above second-order scheme provides greater accuracy for smooth solutions, it is not a total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme and introduces spurious oscillations into the solution where discontinuities or shocks are present. An example of this effect is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates a 1D advective equation \\\\, u_t+u_x=0 , with a step wave propagating to the right. This loss of accuracy is to be expected due to Godunov's theorem. The simulation was carried out with a mesh of 200 cells and used RK4 for time integration. An example of MUSCL type left and right state linear-extrapolation. MUSCL based numerical schemes extend the idea of using a linear piecewise approximation to each cell by using slope limited left and right extrapolated states. This results in the following high resolution, TVD discretisation scheme, :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} u_i}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ F \\\\left( u^*_{i + 1/2} \\\\right) - F \\\\left( u^*_{i - 1/2} \\\\right) \\\\right] =0. Which, alternatively, can be written in the more succinct form, :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} u_i}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ F^*_{i + 1/2} - F^*_{i - 1/2} \\\\right] =0. The numerical fluxes F^*_{i \\\\pm 1/2} correspond to a nonlinear combination of first and second-order approximations to the continuous flux function. The symbols u^*_{i + 1/2} and u^*_{i - 1/2} represent scheme dependent functions (of the limited extrapolated cell edge variables), i.e., : u^*_{i + 1/2} = u^*_{i + 1/2} \\\\left( u^L_{i + 1/2} , u^R_{i + 1/2} \\\\right), u^*_{i - 1/2} = u^*_{i - 1/2} \\\\left( u^L_{i - 1/2} , u^R_{i - 1/2} \\\\right), where, using downwind slopes: : u^L_{i + 1/2} = u_{i} + 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right) \\\\left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \\\\right), u^R_{i + 1/2} = u_{i+1} - 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i+1} \\\\right) \\\\left( u_{i+2} - u_{i+1} \\\\right), : u^L_{i - 1/2} = u_{i-1} + 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i-1} \\\\right) \\\\left( u_{i} - u_{i-1} \\\\right), u^R_{i - 1/2} = u_i - 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right) \\\\left( u_{i+1} - u_i \\\\right), and : r_{i} = \\\\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{u_{i+1} - u_i}. The function \\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right) is a limiter function that limits the slope of the piecewise approximations to ensure the solution is TVD, thereby avoiding the spurious oscillations that would otherwise occur around discontinuities or shocks - see Flux limiter section. The limiter is equal to zero when r \\\\le 0 and is equal to unity when r = 1. Thus, the accuracy of a TVD discretization degrades to first order at local extrema, but tends to second order over smooth parts of the domain. The algorithm is straight forward to implement. Once a suitable scheme for F^*_{i + 1/2} has been chosen, such as the Kurganov and Tadmor scheme (see below), the solution can proceed using standard numerical integration techniques. Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme A precursor to the Kurganov and Tadmor (KT) central scheme, (Kurganov and Tadmor, 2000), is the Nessyahu and Tadmor (NT) a staggered central scheme, (Nessyahu and Tadmor, 1990). It is a Riemann-solver-free, second-order, high-resolution scheme that uses MUSCL reconstruction. It is a fully discrete method that is straight forward to implement and can be used on scalar and vector problems, and can be viewed as a Rusanov flux (to an abusive extent, called Lax-Friedrichs flux) supplemented with high order reconstructions. The algorithm is based upon central differences with comparable performance to Riemann type solvers when used to obtain solutions for PDE's describing systems that exhibit high-gradient phenomena. The KT scheme extends the NT scheme and has a smaller amount of numerical viscosity than the original NT scheme. It also has the added advantage that it can be implemented as either a fully discrete or semi-discrete scheme. Here we consider the semi-discrete scheme. The calculation is shown below: : F^*_{i-\\\\frac{1}{2}} =\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ F \\\\left(u^R_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) + F \\\\left(u^L_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) \\\\right]  a_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\left[u^R_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} - u^L_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. : F^*_{i+\\\\frac{1}{2}} =\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ F \\\\left(u^R_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) + F \\\\left(u^L_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right) \\\\right]  a_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\left[u^R_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} - u^L_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. 1D advective equation u_t+u_x=0, with step wave propagating to the right. Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon the Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme with SuperBee limiter. Where the local propagation speed, a_{i \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\ , is the maximum absolute value of the eigenvalue of the Jacobian of F \\\\left( u \\\\left(x, t \\\\right) \\\\right) over cells {i} , {i \\\\pm 1} given by : a_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\left( t \\\\right) = \\\\max \\\\left[ \\\\rho \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial F \\\\left( u^L_{i+1/2} \\\\left( t \\\\right) \\\\right)}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right) , \\\\rho \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial F \\\\left( u^R_{i+1/2} \\\\left( t \\\\right) \\\\right)}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right), \\\\right] and \\\\rho \\\\ represents the spectral radius of \\\\frac{\\\\partial F \\\\left( u \\\\left( t \\\\right) \\\\right)}{ \\\\partial u}. Beyond these CFL related speeds, no characteristic information is required. The above flux calculation is most frequently called Lax-Friedrichs flux (though it's worth mentioning that such flux expression does not appear in Lax, 1954 but rather on Rusanov, 1961). An example of the effectiveness of using a high resolution scheme is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates the 1D advective equation u_t+u_x=0 \\\\ , with a step wave propagating to the right. The simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells, using the Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme with Superbee limiter and used RK-4 for time integration. This simulation result contrasts extremely well against the above first-order upwind and second-order central difference results shown above. This scheme also provides good results when applied to sets of equations - see results below for this scheme applied to the Euler equations. However, care has to be taken in choosing an appropriate limiter because, for example, the Superbee limiter can cause unrealistic sharpening for some smooth waves. The scheme can readily include diffusion terms, if they are present. For example, if the above 1D scalar problem is extended to include a diffusion term, we get :u_t + F_x\\\\left(u \\\\right) = Q_x \\\\left( u , u_x \\\\right), for which Kurganov and Tadmor propose the following central difference approximation, :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} u_i}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} =  \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ F^*_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} - F^*_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right] \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ P_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} - P_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right]. Where, :P_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[ Q \\\\left( u_{i} , \\\\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\right) + Q \\\\left( u_{i+1} , \\\\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\right) \\\\right], :P_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[ Q \\\\left( u_{i-1} , \\\\frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{\\\\Delta x_{i-1}} \\\\right) + Q \\\\left( u_{i} , \\\\frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{\\\\Delta x_{i-1}} \\\\right). \\\\right] Full details of the algorithm (full and semi-discrete versions) and its derivation can be found in the original paper (Kurganov and Tadmor, 2000), along with a number of 1D and 2D examples. Additional information is also available in the earlier related paper by Nessyahu and Tadmor (1990). Note: This scheme was originally presented by Kurganov and Tadmor as a 2nd order scheme based upon linear extrapolation. A later paper (Kurganov and Levy, 2000) demonstrates that it can also form the basis of a third order scheme. A 1D advective example and an Euler equation example of their scheme, using parabolic reconstruction (3rd order), are shown in the parabolic reconstruction and Euler equation sections below. Piecewise parabolic reconstruction An example of MUSCL type state parabolic-reconstruction. It is possible to extend the idea of linear-extrapolation to higher order reconstruction, and an example is shown in the diagram opposite. However, for this case the left and right states are estimated by interpolation of a second-order, upwind biased, difference equation. This results in a parabolic reconstruction scheme that is third-order accurate in space. We follow the approach of Kermani (Kermani, et al., 2003), and present a third-order upwind biased scheme, where the symbols u^*_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} and u^*_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} again represent scheme dependent functions (of the limited reconstructed cell edge variables). But for this case they are based upon parabolically reconstructed states, i.e., : u^*_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = f \\\\left( u^L_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} , u^R_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right),\\\\quad u^*_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = f \\\\left( u^L_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} , u^R_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right), and : u^L_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = u_{i} + \\\\frac{\\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i} \\\\right)}{4} \\\\left[ \\\\left( 1 - \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2} } + \\\\left( 1 + \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\right], :u^R_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = u_{i+1} - \\\\frac{\\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i+1} \\\\right)}{4} \\\\left[ \\\\left( 1 - \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i + \\\\frac{3}{2} } + \\\\left( 1 + \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\right], : u^L_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = u_{i-1} + \\\\frac{\\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i-1} \\\\right)}{4} \\\\left[ \\\\left( 1 - \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i - \\\\frac{3}{2}} + \\\\left( 1 + \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\right], :u^R_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = u_{i} - \\\\frac{\\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i} \\\\right)}{4} \\\\left[ \\\\left( 1 - \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } + \\\\left( 1 + \\\\kappa \\\\right) \\\\delta u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2} } \\\\right]. 1D advective equation u_t+u_x=0, with step wave propagating to the right. Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon the Kurganov and Tadmor Central Scheme with parabolic reconstruction and van Albada limiter. Where \\\\kappa \\\\ = 1/3 and, : \\\\delta u_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } = \\\\left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \\\\right) ,\\\\quad \\\\delta u_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2} } = \\\\left( u_{i} - u_{i-1} \\\\right), : \\\\delta u_{i + \\\\frac{3}{2} } = \\\\left( u_{i+2} - u_{i+1} \\\\right) ,\\\\quad \\\\delta u_{i - \\\\frac{3}{2} } = \\\\left( u_{i-1} - u_{i-2} \\\\right), and the limiter function \\\\phi \\\\left( r \\\\right)\\\\ , is the same as above. Parabolic reconstruction is straight forward to implement and can be used with the Kurganov and Tadmor scheme in lieu of the linear extrapolation shown above. This has the effect of raising the spatial solution of the KT scheme to 3rd order. It performs well when solving the Euler equations, see below. This increase in spatial order has certain advantages over 2nd order schemes for smooth solutions, however, for shocks it is more dissipative - compare diagram opposite with above solution obtained using the KT algorithm with linear extrapolation and Superbee limiter. This simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells using the same KT algorithm but with parabolic reconstruction. Time integration was by RK-4, and the alternative form of van Albada limiter, \\\\phi_{va} (r) = \\\\frac{2 r}{1 + r^2 } \\\\ , was used to avoid spurious oscillations. Example: 1D Euler equations For simplicity we consider the 1D case without heat transfer and without body force. Therefore, in conservation vector form, the general Euler equations reduce to : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{U}}{\\\\partial t}+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{F}}{\\\\partial x}=0, where : \\\\mathbf{U}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho u \\\\\\\\\\\\ E\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho u\\\\\\\\\\\\p+\\\\rho u^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ u(E+p)\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\qquad and where \\\\mbox{U} is a vector of states and \\\\mbox{F} is a vector of fluxes. The equations above represent conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. There are thus three equations and four unknowns, \\\\rho (density) u (fluid velocity), p (pressure) and E (total energy). The total energy is given by, :E=\\\\rho e + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho u^2, where e\\\\ represents specific internal energy. In order to close the system an equation of state is required. One that suits our purpose is :p=\\\\rho \\\\left(\\\\gamma-1 \\\\right)e, where \\\\gamma\\\\ is equal to the ratio of specific heats \\\\left[ c_p/c_v \\\\right] for the fluid. We can now proceed, as shown above in the simple 1D example, by obtaining the left and right extrapolated states for each state variable. Thus, for density we obtain : \\\\rho^*_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\rho^*_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\rho^L_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} , \\\\rho^R_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\rho^*_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\rho^*_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\rho^L_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} , \\\\rho^R_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right), where : \\\\rho^L_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\rho_{i} + 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\rho_{i} - \\\\rho_{i-1} \\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\rho^R_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\rho_{i+1} - 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i+1} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\rho_{i+1} - \\\\rho_{i} \\\\right), : \\\\rho^L_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\rho_{i-1} + 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i-1} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\rho_{i} - \\\\rho_{i-1} \\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\rho^R_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\rho_{i} - 0.5 \\\\phi \\\\left( r_{i} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\rho_{i+1} - \\\\rho_{i} \\\\right). Similarly, for momentum \\\\rho u , and total energy E . Velocity u , is calculated from momentum, and pressure p , is calculated from the equation of state. Having obtained the limited extrapolated states, we then proceed to construct the edge fluxes using these values. With the edge fluxes known, we can now construct the semi-discrete scheme, i.e., :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{U}_i}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} = - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x_i} \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{F}^*_{i + \\\\frac{1}{2} } - \\\\mathbf{F}^*_{i - \\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\right]. The solution can now proceed by integration using standard numerical techniques. The above illustrates the basic idea of the MUSCL scheme. However, for a practical solution to the Euler equations, a suitable scheme (such as the above KT scheme), also has to be chosen in order to define the function \\\\mathbf{F}^*_{i \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2} } . High resolution simulation of Euler equations based on G A Sod's 'Shock Tube' problem. Shows the analytical solutions along with simulated (2nd order) solutions based upon the Kuganov and Tadmor Central Scheme with Linear Extrapolation and Ospre limiter. The diagram opposite shows a 2nd order solution to G A Sod's shock tube problem (Sod, 1978) using the above high resolution Kurganov and Tadmor Central Scheme (KT) with Linear Extrapolation and Ospre limiter. This illustrates clearly the effectiveness of the MUSCL approach to solving the Euler equations. The simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells using Matlab code (Wesseling, 2001), adapted to use the KT algorithm and Ospre limiter. Time integration was performed by a 4th order SHK (equivalent performance to RK-4) integrator. The following initial conditions (SI units) were used: *pressure left = 100000 [Pa]; *pressure right= 10000 [Pa]; *density left = 1.0 [kg/m3]; *density right = 0.125 [kg/m3]; *length = 20 [m]; *velocity left = 0 [m/s]; *velocity right = 0 [m/s]; *duration =0.01 [s]; *lambda = 0.001069 (Œît/Œîx). High resolution simulation of Euler equations based on G A Sod's 'Shock Tube' problem - SI units. Shows the analytical solutions along with simulated (3rd order) solutions based upon the Kurganov and Tadmor Central Scheme with parabolic reconstruction and van Albada limiter. The diagram opposite shows a 3rd order solution to G A Sod's shock tube problem (Sod, 1978) using the above high resolution Kurganov and Tadmor Central Scheme (KT) but with parabolic reconstruction and van Albada limiter. This again illustrates the effectiveness of the MUSCL approach to solving the Euler equations. The simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells using Matlab code (Wesseling, 2001), adapted to use the KT algorithm with Parabolic Extrapolation and van Albada limiter. The alternative form of van Albada limiter, \\\\phi_{va} (r) = \\\\frac{2 r}{1 + r^2 } \\\\ , was used to avoid spurious oscillations. Time integration was performed by a 4th order SHK integrator. The same initial conditions were used. Various other high resolution schemes have been developed that solve the Euler equations with good accuracy. Examples of such schemes are, *the Osher scheme, and *the Liou-Steffen AUSM (advection upstream splitting method) scheme.

Description  The long creature would have superficially resembled an okapi or a deer. Unlike these, however, Prolibytherium displayed dramatic sexual dimorphism, in that the male had a set of large, leaf-shaped ossicones with a width of , while the female had a set of slender, horn-like ossicones. The taxonomic status of Prolibytherium remains in flux. At one time, it was described as a relative of Sivatherium (as a precursor to \\"Libytherium maurusium\\" (S. maurusium)). Later, it would be regarded as a palaeomerycid, or either as a climacoceratid, or as a basal member of Giraffoidea.

He is also known for predicting a cosmic background radiation,A. K. T. Assis and M. C. D. Neves. \\"Redshift revisited\\", Astrophysics and Space Science. 227:13‚Äì24, May 1995. for the invention of the scintillation counter which contributed to the discovery of the structure of the atom, for his calculation of the charge of an electron and for his early work on atmospheric ozone. He is also credited with the first use of rockets for scientific research. Regener was born in Schleusenau (Wilczak) near Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), West Prussia. He studied physics from 1900 to 1905 at the University of Berlin under Emil Warburg and from 1909 worked with Heinrich Rubens. In 1911 he became professor of experimental physics and meteorology at the Agricultural University of Berlin. In 1920 he became the professor in experimental physics at the University of Stuttgart working alongside the theoretical physicist Paul Peter Ewald. During this time, he developed instruments to measure cosmic rays at various altitudes. Regener's leadership in this field is not always fully recognised as he was persecuted during the Nazi era because his wife was of Jewish ancestry. It has been argued that the naming of terms such as Pfotzer maximum after his student Georg Pfotzer is misleading as Regener was the principal scientist for this work.Erich Regener and the ionisation maximum of the atmosphere Bruno Rossi wrote of this period that \\"In the late 1920s and early 1930s the technique of self-recording electroscopes carried by balloons into the highest layers of the atmosphere or sunk to great depths under water was brought to an unprecedented degree of perfection by the German physicist Erich Regener and his group. To these scientists we owe some of the most accurate measurements ever made of cosmic-ray ionization as a function of altitude and depth.\\"* Ernest Rutherford stated in 1931 that \\"thanks to the fine experiments of Professor Millikan and the even more far-reaching experiments of Professor Regener, we have now got for the first time, a curve of absorption of these radiations in water which we may safely rely upon.\\". In 1937 Regener was forced into \\"provisional retirement\\" by the National Socialists. He then founded the private \\"Research Laboratory for the Physics of the Stratosphere\\" in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, which later became a part of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. In 1939 he was invited to work at the German Army-Air Force rocket research station in Peenem√ºnde where he developed a spectrograph protected by a steel casing. This instrument, later called the Regener-Tonne was the first scientific payload for a rocket designed to reach high altitude. Regener overcame the problems of getting the parachute canopy to open at extreme high altitudes by inflating the parachute with compressed air. After a successful test flight the project was cancelled in September 1944 and the rockets were used as long-range missiles against Britain. The capsule disappeared after Peenemunde tests in 1944 but later resurfaced in the United States. In 1948 Regener was appointed the first vice president of the Max Planck Society. He was also cofounder of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research with Walter Dieminger and was instrumental in attracting physicists back to post-war Germany. Regener was the father of Victor H. Regener and Erika Regener. Erika Regener later married one of Erich Regener's students, Henri Daniel Rathgeber.

She had both engines and sails. Together with the two ships of the Belleisle class and , she was compulsorily purchased by the British Government at the time of the Russian war scare of 1878. Her original design drawings show her as an enlarged Hercules with heavier armament and thicker armour; she was extensively altered from these plans after her purchase, leading to a five-year gap between her launch and her completion. Her poop and forecastle were enlarged, enabling her to carry sixteen ten-inch muzzle- loaders. This was the highest number of heavy guns of uniform calibre ever carried on a British battleship. She also received searchlights, torpedo discharge equipment, extra coal bunkers and extra cabins. In her original design, the mess-deck was unusually lofty. In her conversion an extra deck was added about five feet below the beams, to be used for slinging hammocks. It was always known as the \\"slave deck\\". Although Superb was intended to be able to proceed under sail, and was barque-rigged to this end, it was found that she was unmanageable without power, so no sailing statistics were ever elicited. She had a sister-ship, the Mesudiye, which was commissioned by the Ottoman navy as planned.

Biography Pedro de la Gasca studied at the University of Salamanca and the University of Alcal√°. He became a priest and a lawyer, and was known for his intellect. In 1542 he was negotiator for Emperor Charles V in discussions with the pope and King Henry VIII, a position requiring great diplomatic skill. Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror of Peru, rose in revolt, killed viceroy Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela in battle in 1546, and attempted to have himself crowned king. The Emperor, recovering from a ruinous war, was unable to send an army against Pizarro. Instead, he commissioned La Gasca to restore the peace, naming him president of the Audiencia and providing him with unlimited authority to punish and pardon the rebels. La Gasca sailed from Spain in May 1546, without troops or money. Two Dominican priests and a few servants made up his party. He arrived in Panama, representing himself as a peacemaker charged only with reestablishing justice and granting a general amnesty. La Gasca suggested that if he were unable to fulfill his offices, a royal fleet of 40 ships and 15,000 men was preparing to sail from Seville in June to restore the peace in Peru by more forceful methods. Pizarro's fleet was stationed in Panama, and La Gasca's diplomatic skills soon converted Pizarro's officers to La Gasca's cause. Gonzalo Pizarro, however, refused to submit, and fled secretly to Cuzco, where he had loyal troops. La Gasca, escorted by nearly the whole fleet of Pizarro, landed at Tumbes in 1547. He issued a proclamation announcing his mission as peacekeeper and inviting all good citizens to join him in restoring tranquility. In another proclamation he granted amnesty to all deserters and promised rewards to those who would take up arms in defense of the Crown. He also repealed the New Laws, the cause around which the rebellion had been organized. La Gasca soon assembled a respectable army. He took command himself and marched to Cuzco in December 1547. Pizarro arrived on the plain of Jaquijahuana (Sacsahuana) near Cuzco with a strong force, but La Gasca, relying more on his diplomatic than on his military skills, entered negotiations with Pizarro's officers, winning them over by promises and threats. The two armies met on April 9, 1548 in the battle of Jaquijahuana. Most of Pizarro's officers and men went over to La Gasca, with the exception of Francisco de Carvajal, dubbed the Demon of the Andes. The royalist forces were masters of the field, without having struck a blow. La Gasca had Pizarro and some of his important followers, including de Carvajal executed. He dispersed the adventurers, rewarded the royalists, and pardoned the majority of the rebels. He reorganized the administration of justice and the collection of taxes, and he issued several regulations opposed to the oppression of the Indigenous. La Gasca was tactful and judicious, but unyielding in his devotion to duty. In 1549 he surrendered his powers to the Audiencia. On January 27, 1550 he left Peru to return to Spain. On his arrival there he was made bishop of Palencia by Charles V. In 1561 Philip II promoted him to the see of Sig√ºenza.

He came to America in 1687 with his uncle, who had been named Archbishop of Charcas, in present-day Bolivia. Afterwards, in 1670, he moved to Chile for the first time with the retinue of governor Juan Henr√≠quez. He later returned to Spain, where he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and named Royal Governor of Chile on July 1, 1683. However, he was forced to wait for the term of the serving governor, Jos√© del Garro, to expire before travelling to take up his post, this meant that he could not assume until 1692. On August 9, 1687, he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago. In 1689, he wrote a Funereal Prayer for Marie Louise of Orl√©ans () to mark the death of the Queen. As Governor of Chile His administration was marked by a brief flare-up of the Arauco War. In 1694 the Toqui Millalpal and the Mapuche were incited to revolt by the unauthorized activities of Antonio Pedreros, the Commissary for Indian Affairs, against their machis, whom Pedreros had tried to violently isolate and relocate. Pedreros died of wounds when his force tried to cross the Quepe River to attack Millalpal. The Spanish army of the Captaincy General of Chile was then sent against Millalpal under Maestre de Campo Alonso de Cordova and the Sargento Mayor Alonso Cobarrubias was impossible for Millalpal to resist and he had to capitulate. The governor then called the Parliament of Choque-Choque with the Mapuche, realizing Pedreros had been the source of the dispute and made a peace that lasted for nearly thirty years. Also Poveda had to deal with the expeditions of various pirates against Chilean trade, and the competition between the various functionaries of the Real Audiencia of Chile. During his term, he founded the cities of San Agust√≠n of Talca , Rengo (Villa Hermosa) and Chimbarongo. After his tenure, he received the title Marquis of Ca√±ada Hermosa.

The chances for the generation of these items, alongside for enemy encounter rates are randomly generated at the start of each game. The player's statistics are based on character values from Dungeons and Dragons: Players can have different values for strength, dexterity, and constitution. Players who complete Mission: Thunderbolt can import character data into the Mac OS exclusive sequel, Mission: Firestorm.  Plot  A resistance force has developed in an alien- occuped Earth, and the player protagonist is sent to retrieve an anti-matter bomb in a military installation under the Appalachian Mountains. Alien forces arrive there force, and attempt to destroy the human invaders. Release Doomsday 2000 was initially conceived of as a four-part game with interlinked stories, each part being a special \\"mission\\" for the heroic character (Captain Hazard) whose role people assumed within the game. Mission: Thunderbolt was the first of the missions, and it was the only mission in the 1987 release. This initial game was later expanded over time to also include Mission: Firestorm and Mission: Quicksilver. The fourth mission (Tsunami) never left the concept stage. Casady & Greene published a version of the game's first mission as Mission: Thunderbolt for Mac OS in 1991. John Calhoun provided enhanced creature artwork for that commercial release. Few copies were sold and so was not a commercial success for its author. The second mission was subsequently released by the author himself for Mac OS as JauntTrooper, Mission: Firestorm by way of a hobby, rather than a commercial venture, as was a Windows version of the first mission, JauntTrooper, Mission: Thunderbolt. Mission: Thunderbolt was awarded \\"4 Mice\\" by MacUser Magazine and was placed within the MacWorld 1992 Game Hall of Fame.

After the critical acclaim given to their underground second album A Whisky Kiss (1996), the band left Greentrax Recordings and signed to Vertical Records in the UK and Compass Records in the US and hired long time producer Jim Sutherland to produce their new album. The album sees the band expand their self-described \\"acid croft\\" sound, featuring a wide range of musical influences such as worldbeat, Eastern music, African music, psychedelic music, bluegrass, breakbeat and techno fused with a traditional Scottish Celtic music sound. With this album, Sutherland introduced many unorthodox approaches to the band's music, including looped beats, scratching, electro-atmospherics and sampled 'discovered sounds' from industrial clanks and rumbles to snatches of telephone conversation and recorded pelican crossing announcements. The album was released in August 2000 the UK by Vertical Records and in January 2001 by Compass Records in the US, their first release for the label. The album was the band's first album to be released in the United States. It had received generally positive reviews from critics, complimenting its eclectic sound and wide array of influences. One critic called it \\"interesting and innovative,\\" and another \\"a landmark album.\\" Many also praised Sutherland's production work, although some were less favourable towards it. The band left Vertical Records and established their own label, Shoogle Records, for the follow-up, The Arms Dealer's Daughter (2003). Background and recording Shooglenifty released their first album Venus in Tweeds in 1994 on Greentrax Recordings, four years after the band formed. The album was widely critically acclaimed. In 1995, they toured the album. One reviewer that \\"they took Sidmouth by storm\\" despite \\"the strange lunch time sit down concert\\" that was booked. They released their second album A Whisky Kiss in 1996. Considered a \\"groundbreaking album\\",Living Tradition CD review of Shooglenifty, Solar Shears it was a critical success. The first two albums saw the band develop their Celtic fusion sound. Commenting on the band's sound in his Solar Shears review, George Graham said the band's \\"musical amalgamation\\" involving \\"taking traditional Scottish elements, minus the bagpipes, and mixing them with techno-dance-ambient-rave rhythms, synthesizers, samples and general sonic mutations\\" leads to \\"a curious but very danceable blend.\\"George Graham Reviews Shooglenifty's \\"Solar Shears\\" The duo toured the album throughout 1996, and their performance at Selwyn Hall, Box, Wiltshire was released as Live at Selwyn Hall in November 1996. The band left Greentrax Recordings, their only prior label and who only released the band's albums in Europe, and signed to Vertical Records in the United Kingdom and Compass Records in the United States for the release of the subsequent album. As of 2000, the members of Shooglenifty were Malcolm Crosby on guitar, mandolin and sitar, Angus R Grant on fiddle, Garry Findlayson on banjo and a self-invented electrified instrument he named the \\"banjax,\\" bassist Conrad Ivitsky, who also performs harmonica and berimbau and the percussionist James Mackintosh, an \\"all-important drummer in a style that generally is done without drums\\", credited with \\"drums, percussion, bass, psaltry, programming and samples\\". The band recorded the new album the same year with their ongoing producer-engineer Jim Sutherland in his Edinburgh studio, who handled similar duties on their previous albums. Mackintosh said that \\"the studio was so small and computer-oriented, it didn‚Äôt allow any more than two people playing together at the same time.\\" An avid sonic experimenter, trying all manner of effects devices and unconventional recording techniques, Sutherland is credited on the album as performing the synthesiser and for programming. He was acknowledged as \\"helping this relatively conventionally instrumented band into a wild sonic ride on the album.\\" For the recording process itself, the band arrived with their live arrangements and Sutherland \\"ripped them apart\\". They were multi-tracked, then deconstructed and \\"shredded down.\\" The album is typical of Sutherland touches, notably including many sampled 'found sounds', such as the Schipol Airport and Berne Railway Station, which are dropped into the mix. Bassist Conrad Invitsky, recalling the recording process, said that Sutherland \\"has a whole array of toys and he tends to play with all of them. His favourite things at the moment are a small Tandy mike, worth very little, and a little cheap plastic red speaker. On the track \\"Igor\\" he recorded all the drums through it and then used various compressors, processors and equalizers to get a fat, juicy sound.\\" Sutherland was a perfectionist during production, trying out all the available plugs, processors and files to find sounds. Music The album features numerous \\"found sounds\\", including sounds recorded at Schipol Airport. Keith Whitham of The Living Tradition, comparing the album to their previous album A Whisky Kiss, said \\"in those four years essentially very little has changed. They've unquestionably become more experimental, Solar Shears is a quantum jump in production terms for the group.\\" The album continues the band's self-coined \\"acid croft\\" sound, featuring a blend between Scottish Celtic music, various other world styles and contemporary genres such as techno and ambient. Several critics pointed out an Eastern music influence, and another bluegrass, whilst The Chicago Tribune called it a \\"trippy blend of tradition, psychedelia and instrumental hip-hop.\\" The band made liberal use of distortion pedals and effects boxes in addition to pillaging DJ techniques, working in all types of looped beats, scratching, electro-atmospherics and sampled 'discovered sounds' from industrial clanks and rumbles to snatches of telephone conversation and recorded pelican crossing announcements. George Graham said that the band \\"is a mostly instrumental group whose members are adept as traditional musicians on fiddle, guitar, mandolin, and even banjo. But they deliver their music through a battery of electronic devices from distortion boxes to synthesizers to sampling machines that create grooves that would fit in on the dance floor of a rave.\\" He said that on Solar Shears, \\"in general,\\" \\"it's the kind of album that you can't help but being drawn into, with its irresistibly danceable grooves and sometimes downright wacky combinations of sounds and influences, including some hints of Middle Eastern sensibility.\\" Ann Flint of Rambles commented \\"I was surprised to hear a variety of styles and instruments all jumbled into the music, and all making for an interesting, yet confusing, mix.\\" Describing the album as \\"creatively combining Scottish folk underpinnings with techno and worldbeat, Dave Sleger of Allmusic called it \\"akin to a modern musical jaunt around the world,\\" where, although the band's homeland Celtic roots are most obvious, hints of Mid-Eastern, Far Eastern, and American bluegrass are evident, with a foundation that alternates between groove-heavy techno or ambient with progressive rock & roll arrangements.\\" The first track, \\"The Hijab\\", is said to epiotmize the band's \\"psychedelic techno- Celt sounds. While the music clearly hints at Celtic, the swirl of sounds from the distorted mandolin to the drum loops makes for kind of other-worldly dance groove.\\" \\"Schuman's Leap\\" is \\"eclectic\\" and \\"a bit more Scottish sounding\\" and is dominated by Grant's fiddle, \\"though it is bathed in a sea of electronic cacophony.\\" The fiddle also features prominently on the more laidback \\"August\\". \\"Delighted\\" combines traditional influences with a funky rhythm, and was described by George Graham as \\"one of the most downright danceable pieces on this generally danceable album.\\" \\"Maggie Ann of Clachnabrochen\\" is the only vocal track, featuring \\"telephone-like\\" vocals. Eastern influence features on \\"Igor's\\", described by Graham as \\"a kind of Hungarian techno Celt dervish.\\" \\"Kinky Haroosh\\", which features less of a Celtic influence, also features an ominous, Eastern sound and \\"a collection of vaguely unsettling sounds\\". In contrast, the closing track \\"Bjork's Chauffer\\" [sic], a two-part medley of reels with mostly initially acoustic instrumentalism, is \\"perhaps the most Celtic-sounding track\\", before the \\"techno-Celt\\" fusion of the band's usual sound returns. Release Solar Shears was released in August 2000 in the UK by Vertical Records and on 9 January 2001 in the United States by Compass Records, their first album on both labels. It was their first album released in the United States. It became one of Music Scotland's top sellers in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The album was promoted by a website, which one publication noted was \\"in itself is very telling because it confirms the new age/avant garde nature of this group. Instead of wasting our time and the paper and print of putting information for the listeners onto the CD insert, which is customary, the group has a stylized meadow-scene with the group (one assumes) posed on the front, with chairs placed on their own in the grass, with the group walking up the hillside carrying chairs, and so on. Deep. Rather than giving us readable print, or a way for us to learn more or rave to others (thereby selling more CDs), the group focuses on the music.\\" As with the band's previous albums, it was subject to low-key promotion and as such was not a commercial triumph. Ann Flynt of Rambles said that \\"maybe the best way for me to characterize this group is by referring to them as misunderstood by the masses. We need to bring their music out from the underground and make it available, at least for some of the more eclectic programs on public radio, so that we can hear, and appreciate the fun and mystery of this most enigmatic group and this CD. Ironically, as I prepare to send this, for the first time that I can recall since listening to our local public radio station, Shooglenifty had a song being played, and it sounded great. Now, if they could just give the other, non-aural senses a chance to participate, I could write a more glowing review [of the album].\\" It was the band's only album on Vertical Records, as the left the label shortly after release,Shooglenifty  Solar Shears setting up their own label, Shoogle Records, for subsequent UK releases, beginning with their next album The Arms Dealer's Daughter (2003). The band's percussionist said that he thought this album was \\"more accessible\\" than Solar Shears, saying \\"it‚Äôs not quite a frightening in places.\\" The band toured in promotion of Solar Shears in 2000‚Äì01, and during the Australian leg, mandolin player Luke Plumb joined the band before he became a permanent member, replacing Ian Macleod. Critical reception The album received a positive reception from critics, praising its eclectic sound and array of influences. The Irish Times said that \\"this is tradition standing on its head - essential listening.\\" The Chicago Tribune were positive towards its \\" trippy blend of tradition, psychedelia and hip-hop.\\" Folk Roots were also favourable, saying \\"seamless‚Äìa groove that is pure Celtic.\\" Keith Whitham of The Living Tradition was favourable, saying the album \\"is a quantum jump in production terms for the group. However it's still the elements of banjo/mandolin dueling with Angus Grant's fine fiddle technique which remain the real musical engine room, and is still one of the most refreshing aspects of their whole approach to recording. Thankfully they don't use gadgetry to hide behind a lack of playing ability. I'd like to think that if Frank Zappa had been born on say, Benbecula, this might have been the music he would have chosen to produce.\\" He concluded that \\"Shooglenifty are one of the foremost groups in the 'cool Celt' genera, and I suspect will be so for some time to come now that they have the often difficult third album out of the way. Their musical journey is always that of discovery, as each album appears and I've had time to analyse the contents, my mind moves to where they may take us to next?\\" Dave Sleger of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five and said that \\"clearly progressive can imply many things in popular music, but Shooglenifty should not be haphazardly lumped into the predictable prog camps, as their music really defies categorization.\\" Songlines said the album contained \\"gorgeous melodies allied with killer grooves, an equal appetite for cutting edge clubland stylings and traditional dance forms,\\" whilst Sight & Sound says it shows the band \\"taking their blend of traditional Scottish tunes, samples and breakbeats to further extremes. There are occasional moves towards African and East European musical styles, but Shooglenifty keep their groove pure Celtic. Shooglenifty make music which reaches parts other bands never knew existed‚Ä¶a compelling set dripping with high energy club vibes.\\" Although all reviews were favourable, some noted minor drawbacks with things other than the band's performance. Ann Flint of Rambles was very favourable to the album, calling it \\"interesting\\" and \\"innovative\\", but was unsavoury towards the uncommercial tone of its packaging and artwork, saying that \\"for those who like music and don't have a particular medium they favor, [the album] may be just the ticket. In some ways, it is refreshing to hear a group that isn't playing on its past glories, like the group Kiss, or made up of guys that maybe should have hung it up long ago, like anyone you can think of. So, I can say that Solar Shears is well worth listening to, with well-played, interesting, innovative music, but it would clearly make for a more commercial CD if they would at least make the lyrics, themes and print more discernible to the senses.\\" George Graham praised most of the music, and some parts of its mastering, but was less favourable to other parts, saying that Solar Shears \\"is an album that can be enjoyed on a number of levels -- the way the disparate styles are juxtaposed, the clever arrangements, the first-rate instrumental work -- when the instruments are not being sonically morphed into something else -- and the great dance groove. Techno-Celt or what they call \\"acid croft\\" may be something of a novelty, but this is an album that has enough ideas on it that it will stand up well to many a listening,\\" however, noting that \\"giving this album a grade for sonic quality is difficult. Although there was a lot of creativity shown by engineer/producer Jim Sutherland, sometimes the heavy distortion used on the instruments can reach the point of being a bit irritating, while at other times, the sonic juxtapositions are downright brilliant. Obviously this is an album in which the manipulation of sound is more important than its fidelity. But where undistorted acoustic instruments are heard, they are generally rather clean, and the overall dynamic range of this album is considerably better than one might expect for as concocted a recording a this one.\\" In 2003, other reviewers gave their retrospective opinions on Solar Shears; Iain McQueen of The Living Tradition noted he found the album a disappointment, calling it \\"over produced\\" and saying \\"the sonic effects overwhelmed the strength of the tunes,\\" whilst David Kidman of NetRhythms called it a \\"landmark\\" album with an emphasis on electronica.NetRhythms: A to Z Album and Gig reviews Track listing # \\"The Hijab\\" ‚Äì 5:24 # \\"Schuman's Leap\\" ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"Igor's\\" ‚Äì 3:57 # \\"August\\" ‚Äì 5:20 # \\"Delighted\\" ‚Äì 4:40 # \\"Maggie Ann of Clachnabrochan\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"Rod's Doorway\\" ‚Äì 4:56 # \\"29 Steps\\" ‚Äì 4:08 # \\"Kinky Haroosh\\" ‚Äì 4:15 # \\"Bjorks's Chauffeur\\" ‚Äì 4:41 Personnel * Malcolm Crosbie ‚Äì electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric sitar, mandolin * Garry Finlayson ‚Äì 5-string banjo, banjax * Angus R.

Hose's 12-inch EP was the first recording released with the Def Jam logo.  The Founding  Founded in 1981 by guitarist Rick Rubin, bassist Warren Bell, drummer Joel Horne, and lead singer Rick Rosen, this early \\"artcore\\" band was often touted as the East Coast's answer to Flipper. The band's slow-paced, blues-influenced sound was mostly designed and produced by Rubin, who embodied the best of the era's DIY attitude that continued on to his later career as a top record producer and rock tastemaker. The first recording was a 12-inch EP (or SLP for \\"short long play\\") produced in a dorm activity room with a basic \\"boombox\\" and a single microphone. The initial release featured a jacket with Rubin's interpretation of a Mondrian-inspired design that held to his production idea that bass and drums provided structure and guitars and vocals added color to a song. The record mixed originals with slowed-down covers of pop soul tunes like Hot Chocolate's \\"You Sexy Thing\\", and Rick James' \\"Superfreak\\". Early shows by Hose saw neophyte bassist Bell playing in a seated position, an Electrolux vacuum mic'ed offstage to add white noise, and singer Rosen aggressively entering the audience. Both the band and album received critical praise from reviewer Robert Christgau.  Changes  The amicable departure of Rick Rosen brought dorm-friend Mike Espindle into the vocalist slot in 1982, and his larger-than-life stage presence and growling vocals infused Hose's live shows with a rowdier vibe. Autumn Goft replaced Joel Horne on drums; a skilled, practiced drummer, Goft brought a solid, slightly Bonham-like off-beat to the band's back end. During this period, Hose recorded a 7-inch single that became Def Jam's official first recording. On the vinyl: \\"Mobo,\\" a cover of an obscure French disco song, \\"Girls,\\" a 20-second hardcore thrash, and \\"Zoo,\\" a dumbed-down version of the folk song \\"We're All Going to the Zoo Tomorrow.\\" The single was, again, produced by Rubin (this time in a Long Island City studio) and was released with gouged etchings by Espindle in the center instead of a label and was shipped in a brown paper bag with stickers. NME ran a positive review of the single soon after its release. Bassists during this time shifted between Bell, dorm-friends Steve Williams and Tony Scheitinger, and a pick-up bassist for a San Francisco tour simply known as \\"Sweet.\\" The band also played and toured heavily at this time, sharing the stage with the likes of H√ºsker D√º, the Meat Puppets, the Butthole Surfers, the Circle Jerks, Red Kross, Shark Attack and MDC.  End of days  The budding enterprise of Def Jam and the demands of the fledgling label slowly took Rubin away from performing music, although he did try to include Hose in the fabled deal Def Jam made with Columbia Records. Columbia passed on Hose, but picked up projects like the Beastie Boys and other rap-related acts. The band recorded its final songs, \\"Down by the River\\" and a cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"How Many More Times?\\" as part of Touch and Go Records' \\"God's Favorite Dog\\" compilation (which included bands like Happy Flowers, Big Black and the Butthole Surfers). The songs were recorded with Steve Ett, who would become Rubin's go-to-guy for producing, in what would later become Chung King House of Metal studios made famous by the Beastie Boys and other acts. Hose's last performance together was at Irving Plaza in 1986 with the Butthole Surfers with Rubin, Goft, Espindle and Williams.

The species Sivatherium giganteum is, by weight, one of the largest giraffid known, and also one of the largest ruminants of all time. The Afro-Asiatic species, S. maurusium, was once placed within the genus \\"Libytherium\\". Sivatherium originated during the Late Miocene (around 7 ma) in Africa and survived through to the late Early Pleistocene (Calabrian) S. giganteum remains have been recovered from the Himalayan foothills, dating around 1 million years ago. Suggestions have been made that S. maurusium may have gone extinct as recently as 8,000 years ago, as depictions that resemble it are known from ancient rock paintings in the Sahara and Central West India. But these claims are not substantiated by fossil evidence, and the depictions likely represent other animals. Description MEPAN Outdated moose-like restoration Reconstruction in the museum Sivatherium resembled the modern okapi, but was far larger, and more heavily built, being about tall at the shoulder, in total height with a weight up to .http://www.geocities.ws/rsn_biodata/Data/Sivatherium_giganteum.html (in Portuguese) A newer estimate has come up with an estimated body mass of about . This would make Sivatherium one of the largest known ruminants, rivalling the modern giraffe and the largest bovines. This weight estimate is thought to be an underestimate, as it does not take into account the large horns possessed by males of the species. Sivatherium had a wide, antler-like pair of ossicones on its head, and a second pair of ossicones above its eyes. Its shoulders were very powerful to support the neck muscles required to lift the heavy skull.  Diet  A dental wear analysis of S. hendeyi from the Early Pliocene of South Africa found that the teeth were brachyodont, but had a higher hypsodonty than a giraffe, and that it was best classified as a mixed feeder, being able to both graze and browse.

This genus was formally described by Hugh Falconer in 1868.Falconer, H. (1868).

(Eucladoceros) Sedgwickii, in the collection of the Rev John Gunn, Irstead. In: C. Murchison (Ed.): Palaeontological Memoirs and Notes of Hugh Falconer, Vol. II. Mastodont, elephant, rhinoceros, ossiferous caves, primeval man and his contemporaries: 471-480. Description Eucladoceros tegulensis Eucladoceros was a large deer, reaching in body length and standing about tall at the shoulder, only slightly smaller than a modern moose. It had a spectacular set of antlers which split into twelve tines per pedicle, and were up to wide. The most distinctive feature of Eucladoceros was its comb-like antlers, especially in E. ctenoides. E. dicranios is the most evolved species of the genus, with a dichotomous branching of each antler tine. Eucladoceros was the first deer genus to have highly evolved antlers; however its cranial shape and dental morphology remained primitive, as in Rusa unicolor. Distribution Eucladoceros senezensis fossil The first find (E. dicranios) was in 1841 by Florentine naturalist Filippo Nesti, director of the \\"Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze\\" (\\"Museum of Natural History of Florence\\"). The earliest species of Eucladoceros was described from the Early Pliocene of China. The most abundant fossil remains of Eucladoceros have come from the Early Pleistocene of Europe and China. The systematics of European forms is confused and up to twelve poorly defined species are reported. The majority of those species names are synonymous, and at present only two or three good species are recognized: E. dicranios from England, Italy and Azov Sea Area in South Russia; E. ctenoides from Greece, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and England; and E. teguliensis (a senior synonym of E. senezensis) from France, the Netherlands, and Britain. The latter species is regarded by some authors as a subspecies of E. ctenoides, since there are some finds (for instance, from Ceyssaguet, France) that show a transitional character between E. ctenoides and E. teguliensis. Some poor remains of Eucladoceros are found also in Tajikistan, Pakistan, and India.

For the genus of parrots, see Rhynchopsitta. The thick-billed parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) is a medium-sized green and red parrot found in Mexico, that formerly ranged into the southwestern United States. Its position in parrot phylogeny is the subject of ongoing discussion; it is sometimes referred to as thick-billed macaw or thick-billed conure. In Mexico, it is locally called guacamaya (\\"macaw\\") or cotorra serrana (\\"mountain parrot\\"). Classified internationally as Endangered through IUCN, the thick-billed parrot's decline has been central to multiple controversies over wildlife management. In 2018, the estimated wild population in Mexico was 1,700. Taxonomy Pachyrhyncha is currently classified as a species of the genus Rhynchopsitta of macaw-like thick-billed parrots of which there are two extant species (the other being the maroon- fronted parrot), and one extinct species. However, recent molecular DNA studies indicate that pachyrhyncha and its sister species terrisi in genus Rhynchopsitta are conspecific subspecies. Rhynchopsitta is one of numerous genera of New World long-tailed parrots in tribe Arini, which also includes the Central and South American macaws. Tribe Arini together with the amazonian parrots and a few miscellaneous genera make up subfamily Arinae of Neotropical parrots in the family Psittacidae of the true parrots. The bird was first described by English naturalist and illustrator William John Swainson who designated it Macrocercus pachyrhynchus in Philosophical Magazine, new ser., 1, no. 6, p. 439 (1827). Swainson evidently thought that because of its size and heavy beak, that it was a macaw (at that time, any parrot of the genus Sittace, or Macrocercus). It was later placed in its own genus Rhynchopsitta by French naturalist Prince Charles Bonaparte in 1854. The name is derived from Ancient Greek rhynchos (\\"beak\\") and psittakos (\\"parrot\\") and Greek pachy- (\\"thick\\") and rhynchos (\\"beak\\"), hence a \\"thick-beaked parrot\\". Morphologically, Brazilian ornithologist Helmut Sick calls this bird \\"a highly modified macaw\\". In a recent molecular study, genus Rhynchopsitta was placed in a large clade including all of tribe Arini and a few other genera; its closest relatives were similar in size to the parakeets in Enicognathus, Pyrrhura, Pionites, and Deroptyus genera of the clade. In a separate molecular analysis in the same study, Rhynchopsitta was placed in a clade in which it was sister to Pyrrhura but not other genera. Description The thick-billed parrot is a medium-sized, bright green parrot with a large black bill and red forecrown, shoulder and thighs. Adult eyes are amber, while juveniles have brown eyes. The rest of the bird is bright green. Thick-billed parrots show red shoulders and leading edge on the underwing, followed by a blackish green stripe, then a yellow stripe, followed by the remaining underwing showing dark green. The tail is black. It is 38 cm (15 in) long and weighs 315-370 g. Thick-billed parrots have lived up to 33 years in captivity. It is similar in appearance to the military macaw Ara militaris, which is larger with a proportionally longer tail and blue flight feathers and rump, and the lilac- crowned amazon Amazona finschi (note that these are not the phylogenetically closest relatives - see Taxonomy). The voice of the thick-billed parrot resembles a high-pitched macaw and includes a variety of harsh, rolling calls described as similar to human laughter. Although readily becoming hand-tame, the species is nervous and difficult to breed in captivity, with very low reproduction rates. Captive birds are fair voice mimics and can learn a few phrases and words. However, their piercing calls and comparatively duller coloration has prevented them from becoming popular pet trade birds, and currently there is little demand for them as illegally wild-caught or captive bred birds. Like other parrots, they manipulate their food by holding it with one foot. Highly social, they may feed each other food stored in their crop (a pouch in the throat), and spend their free time preening each other. Groups of over 1,000 birds in one place are known from historical records. Distribution and habitat The thick-billed parrot lives in temperate conifer, pine, mature pine-oak and fir forests at elevation of 1200‚Äì3600 meters. It is largely restricted to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Chihuahua and Durango, Mexico. Its former range included the United States including Arizona and New Mexico. Early accounts also place them in far west Texas (Audubon, El Paso, 1827), and possibly as far north as Utah. Accounts in both Arizona and New Mexico indicate birds visiting regularly, as well as over- wintering in Arizona. However, these accounts co-occurred with heavy shooting, logging, and development that extirpated the thick-billed parrot from its US range. The disruption of Native American ways of life greatly decreased the range of some bird species (e.g., the boreal owl) that utilized Native American irrigation and farm land, and it is possible that the thick-billed parrot also suffered from this effect of European colonization. The last reliable reports of the birds in the southwestern United States were in 1935 and 1938 in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona. Behavior and diet Juvenile (pale bill) and adult (dark bill) at Twycross Zoo, England The thick- billed parrot, like most parrots, nests in tree cavities, especially old woodpecker holes. In the past it is believed to have relied extensively on abandoned nesting holes made by the now-extinct imperial woodpecker, the world's largest woodpecker. The imperial woodpecker was found in Mexico and likely Arizona as well; its decline and eventual extinction may have been a factor in the reduction of the parrot's range. In parts of its existing range, dead or living quaking aspens are the dominant tree selected for nesting. It mainly feeds on seeds from various pine species. Mexican white pine appears to be a preferred species but the seeds of Douglas fir, Apache pine, Chihuahua pine, and yellow pine are also taken. The species is strongly dependent on the supply of conifer cones, breeding at the peak of pine seed production. The species is nomadic, following the variations of cone abundance. To a much lesser extent, they also feed upon acorns and pine buds. They are adept fliers, and historical accounts describe the birds sleeping in one mountain range, and crossing vast distances to feed in another mountain range each day. They deal with deep snow by hanging upside-down and climbing on the bare underside of a snow-covered branch in order to access cones. Conservation and threats Principal threats to the thick-billed parrot are illegal pet trade, habitat loss principally due to logging, climate change (hotter temperatures that raise the snow line and increasing fire threats), and predators especially hawks and owls. The species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and is on Appendix I of CITES, trade forbidden except for legitimate conservation, scientific, or educational purposes. It is also listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A 2004 BirdLife International survey suggests that there may be 2,000‚Äì2,800 mature individuals and only 100 active nests in the entire population, but notes that this may be an overestimate; the distribution of this species is only . In June 2013, the population was estimated as 2097 with the proviso that the number may be an underestimate. However, it is only somewhat established in captive breeding programs in zoos in the United States and Europe, so an ex situ captive conservation project is less feasible than in popularly bred parrots, such as the scarlet macaw. For more than 10 years, Pronatura Noreste (a northeastern Mexican environmental NGO) and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education have been monitoring 700 nests of thick-billed parrots in Chihuahua. Through conservation easements with the ejidos, the organization has created sanctuaries for the protection of the bird's habitat. =Arizona re-introduction= Adult at Edinburgh Zoo, Scotland Birds were reintroduced in Arizona in the 1980s, but this effort turned out to be unsuccessful. The re-introduction into the mountains of southeastern Arizona (the Madrean sky islands region) was dramatically affected by predation. Due to extensive human development, residency, agriculture, etc., high numbers of predator species exist, especially hawks, including the goshawk. The bird loss was especially high to these now well-emplaced predator species. The effort was abandoned in 1993, and the last of the introduced parrots was seen in 1995. The major components of the effort, such as keeping birds in a roughly 2-meter cube cage before release, and artificially implanting feathers onto birds who did not fly on their own, likely affected the bird's ability to survive. The AZA thick-billed parrot breeding studbook offers a critical review of the project's failures. More modern approaches in captive release do not use adult animals that live in cages for long periods before release, as was the case in the 1980s re-introduction project. Relationship with Native Americans Compilation image of an original photograph and recreation based upon that photograph from Kiva #7 at Pottery Mound. Bones of thick-billed parrots used in religious burials, as well as painted sacred and decorative imagery, have been found in prehistoric Native American towns in the American Southwest. These sites are a large distance north of the current thick-billed parrot Mexican range. Sites include Wupatki Pueblo near Flagstaff, Arizona, and Chaco Canyon somewhat near Los Alamos, New Mexico A thick-billed parrot feather utilized in a medicine man fetish has been found in Colorado, showing either trade in feathers or very northern excursions of this species. Considering there is no evidence of live trade of these birds, but ritual burials of parrots in the Southwest utilized live birds, the presence of thick-billed parrot burials at Chaco Canyon in northern New Mexico makes the possibility of northern populations or northern excursions by thick-billed parrots plausible. The most well known of the thick-billed parrot images is from the Pottery Mound site in Southwestern New Mexico. This site has images of the three species most commonly found in religious use in the American Southwest, the scarlet macaw, military macaw, and thick-billed parrot. The lack of a bare facial patch, as is seen in macaw images at the site, is widely considered diagnostic for the identity of the painted bird.

It is located along Kilwa Road, 8 km south east of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. The Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair is an annual major promotional event organised by the Board of External Trade. The Board of External Trade is a government institution, which was established under the Act No. 5 of 1978 to spearhead Tanzania' s Export endeavours. The Trade Fair Grounds which is also known as Mwl. J.K.Nyerere Trade Fair Grounds were inaugurated in 1962, one year after Tanzania gained her independence on 9 December 1961. The Grounds at that time were under the Ministry of Trade and Co-operative Unions and the fair was known as the National Agricultural and Trade Fair (NATF). The first trade fair was held in 1963. It was organised by an expert from UKin the Ministry of Trade and Cooperative Unions by the name Mr. Lucas, with the assistance of Mr. Mashamba who was an official of the Ministry. The Board of External Trade of Tanzania dedicated to establishing global business partnership through organising and managing international and specialised trade fairs, solo exhibitions, product and market research, prospect development, Trade missions, buyer-seller meetings and contact marketing programmes. BET gives out regular trade information and offers consultancy services to producers, exporters and importers to enable them to effectively participate in the global market place. The Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair has established itself over years as the shop window for Tanzanian products as well as the East, Central and the Southern African Region. Supported by the services of the Dar es Salaam harbour which serves the region effectively, the fair acts as one stop centre for reaching countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The fairs enjoys patronage of the Tanzanian business community who both exhibit and use it as a forum for business exchange. Participation has ever been on the increase from a mere over 100 companies in the late eighties to over 1041 companies in 1999. In 2006 a total of 1526 exhibitors exhibited at the fair and came from overseas representing over 18 countries, Tanzania inclusive.

His administration was the longest of all Colonial Governors and the second longest in the history of Chile after the administration of General Augusto Pinochet, who surpassed him by some eight months. Life Gabriel Cano was born in the town of Mora, near Toledo, the son of Juan Cano Ruiz and of Josefa de Aponte Carvajal. Cano joined the Spanish army and fought in Flanders for 33 years, rising through the ranks from Alf√©rez to Brigadier and finally Marshal. He married Mar√≠a Campos, but she died in 1713 without descendants. Due to his outstanding valor and performance during the War of the Spanish Succession he was promoted to Lieutenant General on October 28, 1715 and three days later, was appointed Royal Governor of Chile. On January 5, 1716, he married again, this time with Mar√≠a Francisca Velas de Medrano Navarra y Puelles, in the city of Pamplona. They travelled together to Chile to assume his position, arriving to Santiago on December 17, 1717. =As governor of Chile= In a flare up of the Arauco War he fought the Mapuche toqui Vilumilla in the Mapuche Uprising of 1723. It was ended with the Peace of Negrete in 1726. In 1725, Governor Cano attempted to repress contraband, without complete success, due to the wit and skills of the French and Dutch merchants and the complicity of some of the Kingdom‚Äôs influential citizens. =Death= As a soldier, Cano was an innovative horseman, and historians have documented Cano's \\"inclination for unbridled fun and equestrian exercises\\". On July 26, 1733, while he was participating in a game on horseback, Cano suffered an equestrian accident when he fell with his horse and was crushed by it. The sequence of events that caused his death three months later are unclear, but what is clear is that Cano was badly injured and never recovered, dying on November 11 of the same year. It has been stated that a spinal lesion caused by the accident kept him bedridden for a period of three months, clear in reason and with intense pain, before his death. However, there is no evidence that conveys any typical sign associated to spinal injury following the accident. Therefore, it is possible that Cano suffered a complex pelvic ring fracture. The fact that he was prostrated, lucid, but suffered intense pain best sustains the hypothesis of a pelvic fracture. After the initial period, one of the most common causes of death resulting from a pelvic fracture is deep venous thrombosis with secondary pulmonary thrombo-embolism. This must have been the sequence of events that most probably caused Cano de Aponte's death.

It was commonly used by the government of Saddam Hussein (who was himself ultimately executed), was temporarily halted after the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq that deposed Hussein, and has since been reinstated. Iraqi law states that no person over the age of 70 can be executed; however there have been instances in which this provision was violated, such as Tariq Aziz, who was sentenced to death at the age of 74. There is a guaranteed right to appeal on all such sentences. Iraqi Law requires execution take place within 30 days of all legal avenues being exhausted. The last legal step, before the execution proceeds, is for the condemned to be handed a red card. This is completed by an official of the court with details of the judgment and a notice that execution is imminent. After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer suspended capital punishment on June 10, declaring that \\"the former regime used certain provisions of the penal code as a means of oppression, in violation of internationally acknowledged human rights.\\" However, on August 8, 2004, capital punishment was reinstated in Iraq. Executions resumed in September 2005, after three men convicted of murder were executed. On March 9, 2006, an official of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council confirmed that Iraqi authorities had executed the first insurgents by hanging.Capital Punishment in Iraq Seen Simply As Death, Not Justice 27 people, including one woman, were executed by the Iraqi government on September 6, 2006, for high crimes against civilians.

By that date a total of 132 people had been executed in 2013. In July 2016, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi ordered the execution of all terrorists condemned in the country following the Baghdad suicide truck bombing which killed over 250 people at a mall in Karrada, Baghdad. Iraq carried out at least 88 executions in 2016, and at least 125 in 2017. After the defeat of ISIS in Mosul in 2017, Iraq tried and sentenced captured terrorists to death in large numbers.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle- east-41110412 Notable executions Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity on November 5, 2006, and was executed on December 30, 2006 at approximately 6:00 a.m. local time. During the drop there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken, a successful example of a long drop hanging. By contrast, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, the head of the Mukhabarat, Saddam's security agency, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, former chief judge, were executed on January 15, 2007, also by the long drop method, but Barzan was decapitated by the rope at the end of his fall indicating that the drop was too long, relative to his body weight.AP: Saddam‚Äôs half brother and ex-official hanged January 15, 2007 Also, former vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadan had been sentenced to life in prison on November 5, 2006, but the sentence was changed to death by hanging on February 12, 2007.Top Saddam aide sentenced to hang February 12, 2007 He was the fourth and final man to be executed for the 1982 crimes against humanity on March 20, 2007.

A large section of the road is called Long Hill. It was formerly part of the A6. It runs through a scenic area of the Peak District National Park. In 2010 it was named as the seventh most dangerous road in Britain.'Most dangerous' roads in Britain named by safety group, BBC News, 30 June 2010 Route The road starts at the junction with the A53 just north of Buxton Opera House, where it is called Manchester Road. It climbs out of Buxton in a series fairly gentle curves in a northwesterly direction, reaching its summit at 427m (1400 feet) at the eastern edge of Wild Moor. At this point it crosses the watershed between the North Sea and Irish Sea, and starts to descend into the valley of the River Goyt via a series of sharp bends. The former route that descended into a branch valley before climbing back onto the current route can be clearly seen to the west. The road then straightens for about before entering a second series of curves before passing the hamlet of Fernilee. After Fernilee there is a third series of bends that bring the road to Whaley Bridge. The Western side of the road between Fernilee and Whaley Bridge is embanked behind a retaining wall. Failure of this wall in several places has caused some subsidence. The A5004 (foreground) descending the Goyt Valley The road enters Whaley Bridge at Horwich End, where there are traffic lights at a junction with the B5470 (Chapel-en-le-Frith to Macclesfield road), commonly known as 'The Highwayman'. The A5004 continues north, forming the main street of Whaley Bridge before terminating at a roundabout with the A6 at Bridgemont. Usage The A5004 is the shortest route between Buxton and Whaley Bridge and so is used by local traffic and by drivers seeking a shortcut to avoid the A6 from Buxton to Bridgemont via Dove Holes. For most of its length it passes alongside the picturesque Goyt Valley, which is one of the most visited areas of the Peak District National Park, and the road is the main access route to the valley. Thus, particularly during the summer, there can be a large amount of tourist traffic on the road, including cyclists and walkers. The route also forms one part of the well-known 'Cat and Fiddle ‚Äì Long Hill ‚Äì Highwayman' triangle, which is particularly attractive to motorcyclists because of the frequency and severity of the bends. Given this mixture of usage, the number and sharpness of the bends and the fact that it is not uncommon to encounter straying livestock on the road it is necessary to employ a great deal of caution. Severe winter weather can also make the road extremely hazardous.

Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the canonical narrative. Examples in literature * Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations originally had a bleaker conclusion, with Pip meeting Estella, but after she remarried. In a letter, Dickens stated that he had been persuaded by Edward Bulwer-Lytton to change it prior to publication. * Ernest Hemingway struggled with the ending of A Farewell to Arms. By his count, he wrote 39 of them \\"before I was satisfied.\\" However, a 2012 edition of the book included 47 alternate endings. * Robert A. Heinlein originally killed off the protagonist of Podkayne of Mars, but grudgingly let her live in response to his publisher's objections. * John Green tied one of the characters to railway tracks in his second draft of The Fault in Our Stars to explore the trolley problem. He also wrote an ending in which Hazel and Van Houten die in a shootout with a drug lord. * Felix Salten‚Äôs The Hound of Florence differs greatly in the original German language (Der Hund von Florenz) and in the English translation. The German-language version ends in tragedy: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of. In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the courtesan. Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized. Examples in movies Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's DVD release. These alternative endings are a special type of deleted scene. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews. Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels. The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies: *1408: An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like The Butterfly Effect, with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her. *28 Days Later: Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable. *3 Ninjas: The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as Starz, Showtime and Showtime MAX; international DVDs have this version, as well. *Army of Darkness: In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future in a ruined city. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams \\"I slept too long!\\" *The Astronaut's Wife: When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting... *Blade: Trinity: The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director David S. Goyer. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf. *The Bourne Identity: An alternative ending on the DVD has Jason Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA. The ending was filmed after the studio became concerned that the film's treatment of American foreign policy and the intelligence community would be perceived as anti-American following the September 11 attacks. *The Butterfly Effect: Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his umbilical cord and dies, stillborn. This \\"Director's Cut\\" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh. *Cats & Dogs: Mr. Tinkles has been taken to her sisters by Sophie the Maid. *Child's Play 2: An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile. *Clash of the Titans: After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mount Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete). *Clerks: Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and steals cigarettes without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter. *Clue had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of three of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it. *Die Hard with a Vengeance: In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with Simon smuggling the gold out of the country disguised as Empire State Building statuettes and McClane taking the blame for the failure to stop the robbery. McClane locates Gruber months later in a bar in Hungary, and invites to play a game called \\"McClane Says\\". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself. *Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story: The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the \\"real\\" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, \\"You happy now?\\") *Ella Enchanted: The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. The scene was cut and replaced with a musical ending with the entire cast present, and they exit like they do on stage. *Fatal Attraction: Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex \\"If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you\\". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family. *Final Destination: Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby. *Final Destination 2: The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene. *Final Destination 3: The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision. *The Final Destination: In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, \\"The chain is broken.\\" Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision. *Final Destination 5: In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror. *First Blood: In an alternative ending, John Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004. *Friday the 13th Part III: Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason Voorhees, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn. *Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter: An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film. *Game of Death: This movie has two alternative endings. In the Hong Kong Cantonese print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the Mandarin print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of Bruce Lee. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending. *Happy Death Day: An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory. *Hide and Seek: This movie had many different endings on whether Dakota Fanning's character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home. *I Am Legend: The \\"Monster Woman\\" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a \\"cure\\" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the \\"Alpha Monster\\" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the \\"Monster Woman\\" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the \\"Alpha Monster\\" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer) *I Know What You Did Last Summer: In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads \\"I still know\\". This scene was used in the trailer for the film. *Infernal Affairs: In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, Infernal Affairs III, follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime. *Little Shop of Horrors: In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by the director Frank Oz and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed. *Men in Black II: The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOs. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot. * Orphan: In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate. *Paranormal Activity: In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie. *Paycheck: Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel \\"do you believe in fate?\\" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point. *Pineapple Express: Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down. *Rocky Balboa: Rocky defeats Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed. *Ronin: Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the caf√© considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened. *Scream 3: When Ghostface enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices Sidney Prescott has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending. *Scary Movie 3: Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by Santa Claus. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into The Hulk. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from The Matrix and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be M. Night Shyamalan. *Seven: Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release. *Sliver: Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive. *Smokin' Aces: Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them. *Super Troopers: Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant. *Swordfish: The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip. *The Terminator: The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending. *Terminator 2: Judgment Day: The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity. *Titanic: Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the \\"Heart of the Ocean\\" diamond into the ocean. *Topaz: While Nicole and Mich√®le waiting in front of Stade Charl√©ty, there was a duel between Andr√© and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings. *X-Men: The Last Stand: Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of Jean Grey being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of Magneto several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which Beast is now a professor; Logan coming back to Alberta, Canada, specifically the very same tavern seen in the first X-Men; and Rogue keeping her powers. * Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot. * Whisper: In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling. Examples in television In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used. *24: To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over. *D.I.E: In original ending, Yue Sir (Roger Kwok) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of mo lei tau comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening. *E.U.: Due to the popularity of Michael Tse's character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide. *Green Wing: In the final Special, Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made. *Sex and the City: In the series finale three endings were shot, in which Carrie Bradshaw: (1) becomes engaged to Aleksandr Petrovsky, (2) resumes her relationship with Mr. Big, and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends. *The Simpsons: In the two part episode \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was Waylon Smithers rather than Maggie Simpson. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.) *Lost: At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die. *Total Drama: For every season of this animated \\"reality show\\", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air. *King of the Hill: Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode \\"The Company Man\\"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features. *Psych: the episode \\"100 Clues\\", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode \\"Right Turn or Left for Dead\\" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different. *Pretty Little Liars: In the episode, \\"The Lady Killer,\\" three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternative ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's. *Secrets and Lies: In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot. Examples in music *English rock band Marillion's 1994 concept album Brave is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of Brave featured a double groove on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs \\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"Made Again\\") or would instead play only an alternative version of \\"The Great Escape\\" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story. Examples in video games Many video games also have alternative endings. Since video games are an interactive medium, these endings are generally posed as a result of player action; such as completing the game in a harder difficulty, taking a different route through the game's storyline and succeeding or failing at given tasks.

On a Sunday during Ramadan in January 1835, in the city of Salvador da Bahia, a group of enslaved African Muslims and freedmen, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government. Muslims were called mal√™ in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba imale that designated a Yoruba Muslim. The uprising took place on the feast day of Our Lady of Guidance, a celebration in the Bonfim‚Äôs church‚Äôs cycle of religious holidays. As a result, many worshipers traveled to Bonfim for the weekend to pray or celebrate. Authorities were in Bonfim in order to keep the celebrations in line. Consequently, there would be fewer people and authorities in Salvador, making it easier for the rebels to occupy the city.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 118 The slaves knew about the Haitian Revolution (1791‚àí1804) and wore necklaces bearing the image of President Dessalines, who had declared Haitian independence. Islam in Bahia In Bahia the Hausas were primarily identified with practicing Islam because they adopted Islam before coming over to Brazil. Over time however, the Nag√¥ slaves made up a majority of Muslims in Bahia due to the rise of Islam in Yoruba kingdoms. In fact, by 1835 most of the Mal√™s were Nag√¥s. Furthermore, many of the key figures important in planning the uprising were Nag√¥s including: Ahuna, Pac√≠fico, and Manoel Calafate. Within the Muslim community the Mal√™s had power and prestige, especially the Muslims that had long standing. These members tried to attract new Mal√™s. They did not do so passively, but through proselytizing and conversion. In the African Islamic culture in Brazil there were several external symbols that became associated with the Mal√™s. One symbol came about through the adoption of amulets. In Bahia amulets were common because they were thought to have protective powers and were worn by both Muslims and non- Muslims. These amulets consisted of pieces of paper with passages from the Qur'an and prayers that were folded and placed in a leather pouch that was sewn shut. They were made and sold by √°lufas or preachers. These amulets, however, did not signify a strong commitment to Islam because they were associated with traditional, indigenous African religions. Another symbol of Islam in Bahia was the wearing of a long white frock called an abad√°. In Bahia this garment was worn in private so they would not attract attention from law officials. It was only during the rebellion in 1835 that they were worn in public for the first time and were referred to as ‚Äúwar garments‚Äù by police. A third symbol which was used by Mal√™s to identify themselves prior to the uprising were white, metal, silver, or iron rings placed on their fingers. However, when the Mal√™s were defeated, these rings were no longer effective because now everyone knew what they meant.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 96-104 Growth of Islam in Bahia The urban environment of Salvador facilitated the spread of Islam due to the greater mobility of slaves, the large number of freemen, and the networks between these two groups. All Mal√™s, slave or free, that knew how to read and write Arabic would spread this knowledge on street corners. The houses of freedmen also provided a place for the practice of Islam, as well as slaves own quarters (in their master's house) or ‚Äúprivate mosques‚Äù which were rooms the Mal√™s rented out (the majority of which were in downtown Salvador). At these places Mal√™s met to pray, memorize verses from the Qur'an, and learn how to read and write (on wooden writing slates) Arabic. The Mal√™s also wrote matters of their faith on paper, despite its high cost. In Bahia the Mal√™s had to innovate some aspects of Islam because they feared persecution by officials, but tried to maintain its basic characteristics. For example, the Mal√™s gathered frequently to eat suppers together to represent their effort to commit themselves to the aspect of Islam to only eat food prepared by Muslim hands. They ate mutton often, which signifies ritual sacrifices. During Ramadan their diet consisted of yams, bugloss, rice, milk, and honey. They ended Ramadan by sacrificing a ram. In addition, the Mal√™s celebrated main religious days such as Lailat al-Miraj, which was a sign of success in Bahia because Mal√™s had become a well-defined segment of the Bahian black community.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 104-111 The Revolt While the revolt was scheduled to take place on Sunday, January 25, due to various incidents, it was forced to start before the planned time. On Saturday January 24, slaves began to hear rumors of an upcoming rebellion. While there are multiple accounts of freed slaves telling their previous masters about the revolts, only one was reported to the proper authorities. Sabina da Cruz, an ex-slave, had a fight with her husband, Vit√≥rio Sule the day before and went looking for him. She found him in a house with many of the other revolt organizers and after they told her tomorrow they would be masters of the land she reportedly said, ‚Äúon the following day they‚Äôd be masters of the whiplash, but not of the land.‚Äù.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. p. 74 After leaving this house, she went to her friend Guilhermina, a freedwoman, who Sabina knew had access to whites. Guilhermina then proceeded to tell her white neighbor, Andr√© Pinto da Silveira. Several of Pinto de Silveira‚Äôs friends were present, including Ant√¥nio de Souza Guimar√£es and Francisco Ant√¥nio Malheiros, who took it upon themselves to relay the information to the local authorities.\\"Devassa do levante de escravos occorido em Salvador em 1835,\\" Anais do Arquivo do Estado da Bahia 38,(1968) pp. 61-63‚ÄúPe√ßas processuais do levante dos males,‚Äù ibid. 40 (1971) pp. 42-43Also mentioned in Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. p. 74 All of these events occurred between the hours of 9:30 and 10:30 pm on Saturday January 24. President Francisco de Souza Martins informed the Chief of Police of the situation, reinforced the palace guard, alerted the barracks, doubled the night patrol, and ordered boats to watch the bay, all by 11:00 pm. At around 1:00 am on Sunday, justices of the peace searched the home of Domingos Marinho de S√°. Domingos reported to the patrol that the only Africans in his house were his tenants. However, sensing Domingos‚Äô fear, the justices asked to see for themselves. They went down into his basement and found the ringleaders, discussing last minute details. The Africans were able to turn the officers out into the streets and then started the revolt. Out on the streets, the fighting saw its first real bloodshed; several people were injured and two Africans were killed, including Vit√≥rio Sule, Sabina da Cruz's husband. After securing the area, the rebels split up to go in different directions throughout the city. Most of the groups did very little fighting because they were recruiters, calling slaves to war. However, the largest group traveled up the hill toward Palace Square (modern-day Pra√ßa Municipal), and continued to fight.Francisco Gon√ßalves Martins, Relat√≥rio do chefe de pol√≠cia Francisco Gon√ßalves Martins, in Etienne Ignace Brazil, \\"Os Mal√™s, Revista do Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro 72 (1909) pp. 117-118Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 77-88 (battle narrative) The rebels decided to first attack the jail, attempting to free a Muslim leader, Pac√≠fico Licutan. However, the prison guards proved too much for the rebels, who perhaps were looking to supplement their weak supply of arms with the jailers‚Äô. Unfortunately for the rebels, the reinforced palace guard began firing on them from across the square and they found themselves caught between lines of fire in front of the jail. Under heavy fire, the slaves withdrew from the prison and retreated to the Largo de Teatro. Reinforcements arrived on the slaves' side, and together they attacked a nearby post of soldiers in order to take their weapons. They marched toward the officer's barracks, and put up a good fight, however, the soldiers were able to pull the gate guarding the barracks shut. The slaves had failed.Francisco Gon√ßalves Martins, Relat√≥rio do chefe de pol√≠cia Francisco Gon√ßalves Martins, in Etienne Ignace Brazil, \\"Os Mal√™s, Revista do Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro 72 (1909) pp. 117-118Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 77-88 (battle narrative) The rebels worked their way towards the Vit√≥ria neighborhood, where a number of Muslim slaves lived in the English community there. They regrouped at Merc√™s Convent where the sacristan, a Nag√¥ slave named Agostinho, was a member of the conspiracy. The convent was a pre-determined spot for regrouping. A police patrol came across the rebels here, but retreated from their counter-attack to Fort S√£o Pedro‚Äîa stronghold the rebels did not try to assault. By now the rebels numbered several hundred, but they had not been able to achieve any of their goals. They now headed towards Cabrioto, outside the city to rendezvous with slaves from plantations outside Salvador. In order to get to Cabrioto, however, they would have to pass the cavalry barracks. And when they met in √Ågua de Meninos, the most decisive battle of the revolt took place. At about 3:00 AM, the rebels reached √Ågua de Meninos. The footsoldiers immediately retreated inside the confines of the barracks while the men on horseback stayed outside. The rebels, who now only numbered about 50‚Äì60, did not attempt to attack the barracks. Instead, they sought a way around it.Francisco Gon√ßalves Martins, Relat√≥rio do chefe de pol√≠cia Francisco Gon√ßalves Martins, in Etienne Ignace Brazil, \\"Os Mal√™s, Revista do Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro 72 (1909) pp. 117-118Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 77-88 (battle narrative) However, they were met with fire from the barracks, followed by a cavalry charge, which proved too powerful for the slaves to overcome. After the rebels were completely devastated, more slaves arrived. After assessing the situation, the slaves decided that their only hope would be to attack and take the barracks. However, this desperate attempt proved futile, and the rebels quickly decided to flee. The cavalry mounted one last charge that finished them off.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 73‚Äì92R. K. Kent, African Revolt in Bahia: 24‚Äì25 January 1835, Journal of Social History, 1970. pp. 334‚Äì356. Leadership *Ahuna - Ahuna was a Nag√¥ slave who lived in Salvador. He traveled frequently to Santo Amaro where his owner had a sugar plantation. It has been suggested that his presence was a key factor in the timing of the rebellion. *Pac√≠fico Lucatan- Lucatan was a Nag√¥ slave who worked as a tobacco roller. He was in prison at the time of the rebellion, and one of the main goals was to free him. *Lu√≠s Sanim - Sanim was a Nupe slave who also worked as a tobacco roller. He ran a fund where each member contributed a day's wages for slave labor, presumably monthly, and this money was divided into three parts: one part for cloth to make Muslim garments; a part to masters' portions of slave wages‚Äîsince Mal√™ slaves did not work on Fridays; and one part to help buy letters of manumission. *Manoel Calafate - Calafate travelled to Santo Amaro to mobilize rebels on the eve of the uprising. He took an active part in the fighting and appears to have been killed in Palace Square. *Elesb√£o do Corma - Elesb√£o do Corma was a Hausa freedman who was known in the African community as Dandar√°. He owned a tobacco shop which was also used as a meeting place for Mal√™s. He also traveled through the Rec√¥ncavo for his business, and brought the Muslim faith to slaves on the plantations there.Jo√£o Jos√© Reis, Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia, Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993. pp. 129-134 Aftermath Fearful that the whole state of Bahia would follow the example of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and rise up and revolt, the authorities quickly sentenced four of the rebels to death, sixteen to prison, eight to forced labour, and forty-five to flogging. Two hundred of the remainder of the surviving leaders of the revolt were then deported by municipal authorities back to Africa; they employed the slaver Francisco F√©lix de Sousa for the Atlantic journey. The deportees, who consisted of freed and enslaved Africans, were sent in stages to the Bight of Benin starting in 1835, specifically to the existing Lusophone colony in Dahomey. It is believed that some members of the Brazilian community in Lagos, Nigeria, Tabom People of Ghana are descended from this deportation, although descendants of these Afro-Brazilian repatriates are reputed to be widespread throughout West Africa (such as Sylvanus Olympio, the first president of Togo). The term \\"Aguda\\" on the other hand refers to the mainstream, predominantly Christian Brazilian returnees to Lagos who brought Roman Catholicism in their wake; which is why that denomination is often referenced in Yoruba as \\"Ijo Aguda\\" (The Portuguese Church). News of the revolt reverberated throughout Brazil and news of it appeared in press of the United States and England. Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the mal√™s very carefully. National and local laws were passed to further control enslaved people in Brazil; these included the death penalty without possibility of recourse for the murder of a plantation owner, overseer, or family members of a plantation owner. In subsequent years intensive efforts were made to force conversions to Catholicism and erase the popular memory and affection towards Islam. However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.Steven Barboza, American Jihad, 1993. Many consider this rebellion to be the turning point of slavery in Brazil. Widespread discussion of the end of the trans-Atlantic slave trade appeared in the press. While slavery existed for more than fifty years following the Mal√™ Revolt, the slave trade was abolished in 1851. Slaves continued to pour into Brazil immediately following the rebellion, which caused fear and unrest among the people of Brazil.

Although it took a little over fifteen years to happen, the slave trade was abolished in Brazil, due in part to the 1835 rebellion.Dale T.

Types of storage violation Storage violation can, for instance, consist of reading from, writing to, or freeing storage not owned by the task. A common type of storage violation is known as a stack buffer overflow where a program attempts to exceed the limits set for its call stack. It can also refer to attempted modification of memory \\"owned\\" by another thread where there is incomplete (or no) memory protection. Avoidance of storage violations Storage violations can occur in transaction systems such as CICS in circumstances where it is possible to write to storage not owned by the transaction; such violations can be reduced by enabling features such as storage protection and transaction isolation. Detection of storage violations Storage violations can be difficult to detect as a program can often run for a period of time after the violation before it crashes. For example, a pointer to a freed area of memory can be retained and later reused causing an error. As a result, efforts focus on detecting violations as they occur, rather than later when the problem is observed. In systems such as CICS, storage violations are sometimes detected (by the CICS kernel) by the use of \\"signatures\\", which can be tested to see if they have been overlaid. An alternative runtime library may be used to better detect storage violations, at the cost of additional overhead. Some programming languages use software bounds checking to prevent these occurrences. Some program debugging software will also detect violations during testing.

The Greater Hilltop area contains newer and historic neighborhoods, schools, various stores, industrial areas, and recreational facilities. The development pattern is considered a distinct suburb. The majority of the area is predominantly single family residential.Columbus (Ohio) & Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio). (2010). Greater Hilltop plan amendment. Columbus Planning Division.  History  Camp Chase state historical marker Camp Chase as it was in 2014 (before being vandalized in 2017), a memorial to 2,260 Confederate soldiers from the Civil War who died in Camp Chase. = Etymology = The name of this area derives from Lucas Sullivant, who was first deeded this land. For a time the area was known as Sullivant‚Äôs Hill and as time went on, the ownership of the land was transferred and the name was changed to the Hilltop. As the area is an assortment of smaller neighborhoods, the Greater Hilltop is used in some publications to describe this neighborhood, while Hilltop is also used and is a name that helped combine them all.Ohio., & Sims, W. R. (1973). Neighborhoods: Columbus neighborhood definition study. Columbus, Ohio: Dept. of Development. =Early history= The first inhabitants of this area were Native Americans, whose remains are scattered throughout the area. This area was vital due to its geographical characteristics, as the hill which became its namesake as well as its surrounding fertile land.Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio). (1984). Hilltop USA: History and homes. Columbus, OH: Greater Hilltop Area Commission. Lucas Sullivant came to this land in 1795 and became the first man to be granted a deed. Sullivant chose to reside in the Franklinton area while giving 1600 acres of land to his sons, making them the first landowners in Hilltop. The land stayed within the family for over a hundred years, as the land was transferred from heir to heir.Ohio., & Sims, W. R. (1973). Neighborhoods: Columbus neighborhood definition study. Columbus, Ohio: Dept. of Development. During this early period, Hilltop remained a largely rural area, with a number of farmers producing corn, cloverseed and hay as well as raising livestock. The National Road or Route 40 was the first major development in the area. This road, which later became known as Broad Street, was built in the 1830s and become home to various landmarks such as the Four-Mile House and the Jaybird Hotel. One of the most important establishments of this era was Camp Chase, a staging and training ground for the Union during the Civil War. It was also known as the largest prisoner camp in the north, with over 9,000 prisoners in 1865. Upon the camp's closing, a small portion became a cemetery and memorial for Confederate soldiers. =20th century= The Hilltop Area was once home to the Columbus State Hospital for the Insane. Built in 1870, this hospital was a staple of the neighborhood and its impact has been felt ever since. Bordered by Broad St. to the south and Wheatland Ave. to the west, this site served as a gateway into the community. The style of this hospital was very similar to a hospital in Athens, Ohio, yet significantly larger. This building followed the Kirkbride Plan, a system established to provide \\"air and sunlight\\" in order to cure its patients. The building was closed in the 1980s, and subsequently torn down and replaced by offices of the Ohio Department of Public Safety and Ohio Department of Transportation.\\"Kirkbride Buildings - Columbus State Hospital.\\" Columbus State Hospital. N.p., n.d. Web. 8 December 2014. This hospital as well as the Columbus State Institute employed nearly 450 people, many of whom lived in Hilltop. During the early 20th century, the Hilltop began its transition from a farming to an urban community. Subdivisions began to form around this time around the Columbus State Institution and streets were formed along rural roads. Its own streetcar system came with the introduction of these roads, which ran from High Street to the Columbus State Hospital. Businesses began to emerge along Broad Street, from a small grocery store to a meat market. By 1900, there were over 2000 residents in Hilltop. The majority of the population were young married couples with a few small children at this time with various occupations. The early 20th century laid the groundwork for the infrastructure of the area and encouraged growth and expansion. After the 1913 flood, there was a large population surge as the community was able to adapt due to its existing infrastructure. Also during the early 20th century, the Hilltop became the home for many \\"well-to-do\\" African American families who owned large parcels of land still used for farming and other entrepreneurial endeavors. One such family was the Carter family, whose migration from Virginia to Ohio had occurred years earlier. The matriarch of the family was actually a native American and the patriarch an African American. Together throughout the period of 1900-1940, they had 11 children, many of whom went on to become civic leaders in Columbus, Dayton and other Ohio and California cities. Most notably, Mary Carter Glascor, and her brother, Judge Russell Carter are known for their outstanding service to their communities and universities. Both are graduates of The Ohio State University and went on to obtain graduate and higher degrees, from various schools, including Harvard University.Community activist Mary Carter Glascor dies in sleep at age 100 Retrieved July 20, 2019 By 1924, the population had reached 15,000 and the community was self-sustaining with schools, employment and services for its residents. Growth slowed during the war years, but following the war it began to increase yet again. Many businesses were prospering at the time and the Hilltop's political activeness was at its peak. With the mayor of Columbus hailing from the Hilltop, there was a strong sense of community within the area. With General Motors (Fisher Body and Delphi divisions) being the source of jobs for many local residents. As time went on, Hilltop became susceptible to many of the same problems as other urban areas as businesses began to close and residents moved further outside the city limits.Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio). (1984). Hilltop USA: History and homes. Columbus, OH: Greater Hilltop Area Commission. =Modern era= Similar to many urban neighborhoods, as jobs left the area, poverty took their place. The foundation set by the community remains, but the area has lost many residents and some of its major employers, causing a slow decline over recent years. Some of the plans created for this area include 2008 Hilltop/West Broad Corridor Market Analysis and the 2005 West Broad Street Economic Development Strategy, which were developed for portions of the planning area. The Hilltop/West Broad Corridor Market Analysis detailed a market analysis for land uses along West Broad Street from Highland to Demorest avenues. The West Broad Street Economic Development Strategy and The Highland West Visioning Charrette focused on the portion of West Broad Street from Highland to Terrace avenues, to provide the city and the community with a blueprint for revitalizing this portion of West Broad Street.Columbus (Ohio)., Columbus (Ohio)., & Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio).

Its main thoroughfares are West Broad Street (U.S. Route 40) -- upon which two welcome signs for the neighborhood sit (one near I-70 and one near Wilson Road) -- Mound Street, and Hague Avenue. Within these bounds there are several jurisdictions including the city of Columbus, the city of Urbancrest, the village of Valleyview, Franklin County, Franklin Township, Jackson Township and Prairie Township. This area covers approximately 9,917 acres. Just east of this area is a neighborhood by the name of Franklinton.Greater Hilltop Area Commission The name, \\"The Greater Hilltop\\", indicates an opportunity for the community to help shape and direct the pattern of growth and the character of future development in the neighborhood.Columbus (Ohio)., Columbus (Ohio)., & Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio).

Beginning with the creation of the National Road, residents as well as visitors used the area to move throughout Columbus. Establishments such as Camp Chase and the Columbus State Hospital brought more people to the area. With the inception of a streetcar system, the Hilltop began to transform into a more urban area, with transportation being its catalyst. Various railways also traversed the area, making it a prime location for commerce, which led to it being selected to home a General Motors plant. The freeways that surround the area, routes 270 and 70, played a crucial role in laying the boundaries. Currently the area is automobile-focused and the main boulevards continue to adapt to the modern era.Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio). (1984). Hilltop USA: History and homes. Columbus, OH: Greater Hilltop Area Commission.  Demographics  The Hilltop area includes 67,781 residents and 25,344 households in 2010 with a population density of 4,183.7 people per square mile. The planning area was slightly older than the city as a whole with a median age of 34 years (the city was 31 years). The Greater Hilltop population decreased 1.2% between 2000 and 2010, while the number of households decreased by 1.2% as well, indicating a gradual reduction in the average household size, a common trend found in many areas of Columbus.U.S. Census Bureau. ‚ÄúPopulation Density, 2010.‚Äù Social Explorer.

This area is also home to a branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, one of the largest branches in Columbus. The Hilltop is also home to Camp Chase, a Union camp from the Civil war. There also once stood a Quaker church, as Quaker settlers moved into this area following the Civil War.  Land use  Greater Hilltop provides a mix of land uses. Much of the existing land use is residential (51%) followed by industrial (16%) that provides employment for the region. More than 50% of commercial (9%) land use is with community scale. Institutional (7%), parks and open space (7%), vacant property (4%), office (3%), agriculture and utilities (2%) fills the other quarter of the land use. The development of the Greater Hilltop followed an east to west pattern. The eastern portion of the Hilltop was first settled in the early 1800s. Accordingly, the community's earliest neighborhoods, parks and commercial uses are located here. The development pattern to the south and west takes on a distinctly suburban feel; commercial uses are larger, auto-oriented retailers and residential uses change from a traditional grid street pattern to winding subdivision streets.Columbus (Ohio)., Columbus (Ohio)., & Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio). (2010). Greater Hilltop plan amendment. Columbus, Ohio: Columbus Planning Division. = Residential = Majority of the residential land use is for single family (81%). Multifamily (14%) and two- three family (5%) only make up the remainder percentage.Columbus (Ohio)., Columbus (Ohio)., & Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio). (2010). Greater Hilltop plan amendment. Columbus, Ohio: Columbus Planning Division. Most single and two-three family residential units are in the interior of the area. Single family units are considerably bounded by W Broad Street and I-270. Multifamily units are typically located on the major corridors, such as West Broad Street and Sullivant Avenue. = Commercial/industrial = Commercial uses are along the primary corridors -- West Broad Street, Sullivant Avenue, Georgesville Road. They are mostly community-scale commercial uses as well as automobile-oriented commercial uses. Manufacturing is primarily located in the northwest portion of the planning area. Both West Broad Street and Sullivant Avenue corridors are zoned almost entirely commercial. Economic development of the Greater Hilltop area has been a major concern recently; focus has been given to revitalizing the east of West Broad Street, and the West Broad Street Economic Development Strategy was adopted in 2005 and in the Highland West Visioning Charrette (2006).Columbus (Ohio)., Columbus (Ohio)., & Greater Hilltop Area Commission (Columbus, Ohio).

Etymology The subspecific name, annulatus, comes from the Latin noun annulus, meaning \\"ring\\", and refers to the banded subcaudal surface. This banding is one of the key characteristics to differentiate this subspecies from the nominotypical subspecies, Sceloporus merriami merriami. Geographic range S. m. annulatus is native to a fairly narrow range from the Big Bend region of the US state of Texas, to eastern Coahuila in Mexico. The holotype was collected by Edward Harrison Taylor and J.S. Wright in August 1931 in the Chisos Mountains of Brewster County, Texas.  Description  The Big Bend canyon lizard is a medium-sized lizard, growing from 4.5 to 6.25 inches (11.5‚Äì16 cm) in total length. Its coloration varies with its choice of habitat, varying from grey to reddish, with two rows of dark spots down each side of the back and a dark line on the shoulder region. It has a fairly large head for its body size, and a dewlap which is larger in males than females. Males also have distinct blue patches on either side of the belly. In this subspecies there are fewer than 53 dorsal scales from the interparietal scale to the base of the tail.Conant, R. 1975.

In 1796, when the viceroyalty was abolished and transformed into Pskov Governorate, the uyezd was abolished as well; however, it was re-established in 1802. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds and governorates were abolished and Novorzhevsky District, with the administrative center in Novorzhev, was established as a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast.Administrative-Territorial Structure of Pskov Oblast, pp. 11‚Äì14 It included parts of former Novorzhevsky Uyezd. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.

The movement of data takes place in an automated way with the help of a software or embedded firmware and is assigned to the related media according to performance and capacity requirements. More advanced implementations include the ability to define rules and policies that dictate if and when data can be moved between the tiers, and in many cases provides the ability to pin data to tiers permanently or for specific periods of time. Implementations vary, but are classed into two broad categories: pure software based implementations that run on general purpose processors supporting most forms of general purpose storage media and embedded automated tiered storage controlled by firmware as part of a closed embedded storage system such as a SAN disk array. Software Defined Storage architectures commonly include a component of tiered storage as part of their primary functions. In the most general definition, Automated Tiered Storage is a form of Hierarchical Storage Management. However, the term automated tiered storage has emerged to accommodate newer forms of real-time performance optimized data migration driven by the proliferation of solid state disks and storage class memory. Furthermore, where traditional HSM systems act on files and move data between storage tiers in a batch, scheduled like fashion, automated storage tiered systems are capable of operating at sub-file level both in batch and real-time modes. In the case of the latter, data is moved almost as soon as it enters the storage system or relocated based on its activity levels within seconds of data being accessed, whereas more traditional tiering tends to operate on an hourly, daily or even weekly schedule. Some more background on the relative differences between HSM, ILM and automated tiered storage is available at SNIA web site.http://www.snia.org/sites/default/education/tutorials/2012/spring/storman/LarryFreeman_What_Old_Is_New_Again.pdf A general comparison of different approaches can also be found in this 'comparison article on auto tiered storage'. OS and Software Based Automated Tiered Storage Most server oriented software automated tiered storage vendors offer tiering as a component of a general storage virtualization stack offering, an example being Microsoft with their Tiered Storage Spaces.https://redmondmag.com/articles/2013/08/30/windows-storage- tiering.aspx?m=1 However, automated tiering is now becoming a common part of industry standard operating systems such as Linux and Microsoft Windows, and in the case of consumer PCs, Apple OSX with its Fusion Drive.\\"Apple iMac Performance Website\\" October 24, 2012. This solution allowed a single SSD and hard disk drive to be combined into a single automated tiered storage drive that ensured that the most frequently accessed data was stored on the SSD portion of the virtual disk. A more OS agnostic version was introduced by Enmotus which supports real-time tiering with its FuzeDrive product for Windows operating systems, extending support to storage class memory offerings such as NVDIMM and NVRAM devices.http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/486631/file-2586107985-pdf/PDFs/20111129_S2-102_Mills.pdf?t=1447892865729 SAN Based Tiered Storage An example of automated tiered storage in a hardware storage array is a feature called Data Progression from Compellent Technologies. Data Progression has the capability to transparently move blocks of data between different drive types and RAID groups such as RAID 10 and RAID 5. The blocks are part of the \\"same virtual volume even as they span different RAID groups and drive types. Compellent can do this because they keep metadata about every block -- which allows them to keep track of each block and its associations.\\". Tony Asaro, Computerworld. \\"Compellent-Intelligent Tiered Storage.\\" January 19, 2009. Another strong example of SAN based tiering is DotHill's Autonomous Tiered Storage which moves data between tiers of storage within the SAN disk array with decisions made every few seconds\\".  Automated Tiered Storage vs. SSD Caching  While tiering solutions and caching may look the same on the surface, the fundamental differences lie in the way the faster storage is utilized and the algorithms used to detect and accelerate frequently accessed data. SSD caching operates much like SRAM-DRAM caches do i.e. they make a copy of frequently accessed blocks of data, for example in 4K cache page sizes, and store the copy in the SSD and use this copy instead of the original data source on the slower backend storage. Every time a storage read occurs, the caching software look to see if a copy of this data already exists on the cache and uses that copy, if available. Otherwise, the data is read from the slower, hard drive storage. Tiering on the other hand operates very differently. Using the specific case of SSDs, once data is identified as frequently used, the identified blocks of data are moved in the background to the SSD and not copied as the SSD is being utilized as a primary storage tier, not a look aside copy area. When the data is subsequently accessed, the IOs occur at or near the native performance of the SSDs. \\"Tiering vs. caching in flash-based storage systems\\"  See also  * Hierarchical storage management * Tiered storage  References  * Russ Taddiken ‚Äì Senior Storage Architect (2006).

Corey Hughes is the youngest brother of former Bulldogs players, Glen Hughes and Steven Hughes. He is the son of former Canterbury five-eighth, Garry Hughes. Background Hughes was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Playing career Hughes made his first grade debut for Canterbury in round 8 of the 1998 NRL season against the Adelaide Rams at Belmore Oval, scoring a try during a 30-4 victory. In the 1998 NRL season, Hughes played 15 games as Canterbury finished 9th on the table and qualified for the finals. Canterbury proceeded to make the 1998 NRL Grand Final after winning 4 sudden death elimination matches in a row including the club's famous preliminary final victory over rivals Parramatta which is considered to be one of the greatest comebacks of all time.

It was then revealed that Canterbury had exceeded the NRL's salary cap by $2 million over 3 years including undisclosed payments made to players. As a result, the NRL fined Canterbury $500,000 and stripped them of all their 37 competition points meaning that the club would finish the 2002 season with the wooden spoon.

He was known for his comedies and interludes. He was also rumoured to be an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. Life Richard Edwardes was born in 1525 in Somerset. Some of Edwardes' descendants have claimed that his mother was a mistress of Henry VIII and that Richard was Henry's son, although there has been no evidence to prove or disprove this theory (other than a poor family being able to send one child to Oxford University, but none of the others, and then Richard being given the position of head of the Royal Chapel at Windsor Palace). Descendants observe that it was unusual for someone from such a poor family to get an Oxford education. Edwardes began his studies at Corpus Christi College, Oxford in May 1540 and joined Christ Church, Oxford as it opened in 1546. He joined Lincoln's Inn but did not take up law as a career. He joined the Chapel Royal by 1557 and was appointed Master of the Children in 1561. He married Helene Griffith in 1563. After he died in 1566, he was succeeded by William Hunnis. Works =Plays= In 1566, Edwardes' Palamon and Arcite was performed before Elizabeth I at Oxford when the stage fell ‚Äî three people died and five were injured as a result. Despite the tragic accident, the show continued to play that night. The excellent Comedie of two the moste faithfullest Freendes, Damon and Pithias (written in 1564, published in 1571), a comedy, is his only extant play. =Poems= Ten of Edwardes' poems appear in the first edition of the Paradise of Dainty Devices, though publisher Henry Disle says the poems are \\"written for the most part by M. [Master] Edwards.\\" Edwardes possibly compiled the manuscript on which the Paradise of Dainty Devices is based. =Music= Edwardes was less well known as a composer, but several of his compositions survive, including three pieces in the Mulliner Book: \\"O the syllye man,\\" ascribed to him by the book, and two anonymous pieces usually attributed to him, \\"In goinge to my naked bedde\\" and \\"When grypinge griefes.\\" Other pieces include a song from Damon and Pithias, \\"Awake, ye woeful wights,\\" and a setting of the Lord's Prayer in Richard Day's Psalter of 1563.

It was partially constructed on land that formerly housed the American Civil War Camp Chase and a Confederate prison. After the Civil War, the land was purchased by Joseph Binns and his associates with the intent to start a Quaker community. These plans failed to materialize and the land was developed as a \\"streetcar suburb\\" in the 1920s. Located west of downtown, the neighborhood is home to Westgate Park and Recreation Center, Westgate Alternative Elementary School, St. Mary Magdalene Church and school, and Parkview United Methodist Church. 4,500 residents live within the Westgate boundaries, most in single family houses. The Columbus Dispatch named Westgate one of the most affordable neighborhoods in the City of Columbus in October 2008. Westgate is located 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Downtown Columbus and is bounded by W. Broad Street to the north, Demorest Road to the west, Sullivant Avenue to the south, and Hague to the east.  History  = Camp Chase = One third of Westgate sits on land that was formerly Camp Chase during the Civil War. This camp was opened in 1861 and served as training grounds for the Union Army. It is named after the former Governor of Ohio and Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase. Eventually it was converted to a prisoner of war camp to hold captured Confederate soldiers. At the beginning it held 250 prisoners, but after many expansions it became large enough to house 9,146 men. The camp was emptied of all prisoners on July 5, 1865. = Camp Chase Cemetery = Camp Chase The only thing remaining from Camp Chase today is the cemetery. The cemetery is one of only two remaining federal properties from the Civil War that is located in Columbus. Memorial services began in 1895, and continue to the present day. The headstones were placed in the cemetery between 1906 and 1908 by a marble company in Nelson, Georgia. These headstones do not mark individual graves, but rather exist to represent those that died. Residents began having an annual bean dinner around the cemetery in the 1930s in order to remember and honor those that gave their life in the war. This event continues today and takes place on the last Saturday in June. The Hilltop Historical Society holds an annual memorial service at the cemetery on the second Sunday of June. This event includes reenactment soldiers and characters from the time. The cemetery is currently on the National Registrar of Historic Places and is maintained by the Dayton National Cemetery. = Short Creek Quarterly Meeting of the Quaker Church = Shortly after the Civil War, members of the Short Creek Quarterly meeting of the Quaker Church showed their interest in the ensuing auction of a 463.5 acre plot of land in the Hilltop area. Their intention was to use this land to create their dream Quaker settlement. Five Quaker men came to the site in 1870 in order to determine whether or not it met their needs. They determined this land to be suitable and consequently returned to purchase it in 1872. This purchase took place on January 23 and cost $87.50 per acre. Many notable Quakers moved here such as John Cowgill, John Hussey, and William H. Harris. Many of the streets in Westgate today are named for these Quaker settlers.  Founding  In 1905, after the end of the Civil War and subsequent purchase of the Camp Chase property by Quaker settlers, the land was sold to a real estate agency and subdivided for housing. Building of homes began in the 1920s and by the mid-1920s Westgate was established as one of Columbus' streetcar suburbs.  Structures and Landmarks  178x178px Westgate Park is a 46.3 acre city park located in the center of the Westgate neighborhood. It features a fishing pond, a rain garden, and a playground, as well as picnic areas, an open shelterhouse, a walking trail, and a wooded area.

It sits immediately north of West High school. Their mission is to help people to find their way back to God. They have been offering regular weekly services since their foundation in 1927. Parkview United Methodist Church is centrally located just north of Westgate park. This church was very important in the plan for the neighborhood. This can be seen in the multiple streets that converge around it as well as in its prominent placement in relation to the park. Its address is 345 S Brinker Ave, and it was constructed in 1941.  Events  Summer Jam West is a free arts and music festival held annually in Westgate Park on the second Saturday in July. There are live bands, local art for sale, hand crafted items for sale, free face painting for the kids and a free art zone. Summer Jam is open to all. The focus is on bringing art and music to the Hilltop. Hilltop Bean Dinner is an annual event held in late June where the Hilltop community congregates in Westgate park to share a meal. This event consists of music, art vendors, historic car shows, and most importantly the bean dinner. This event attracts many people from outside of the Westgate and greater Hilltop area as it is one of the primary annual events in the area. The Westgate Home and Garden Tour is held on the second Saturday in June, from 2:00 - 6:00 PM. The Westgate Farmers Market is held on the first and third Saturdays of each month, June through October, from 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM at the West Gate Masonic Lodge.''  Education  222x222px Westgate Alternative Elementary School is a public kindergarten-through-5th-grade elementary school located at 3080 Wicklow Road in Westgate. Its mission statement reads: \\"Each student is highly educated, prepared for leadership and service, and empowered for success as a citizen in a global community.\\" The school's standardized test performance ranks it 962nd among the 1596 Ohio public elementary schools and 7th among the 74 ranked elementary schools in the Columbus City School District. Saint Mary Magdalene School is a private elementary school that teaches grades kindergarten through 8th. It was established in 1928 and has continually taught students since. The school consists of six buildings which are centrally located on a main campus. It is supported by the Ohio Catholic School Accreditation Association and the State of Ohio. West High School is a public high school that teaches grades 9-12 and is located at 179 S Powell Ave, Columbus, OH. It shares the same mission statement as Westgate Alternative Elementary School. Their colors are buff and brown and their mascot is the cowboy. In 2014 the school was ranked 708th out of 756 high schools for standardized tests as its average reading score was 76.3. This is up from 2012 when the school was ranked 733rd and had an average reading test score of 69.5.  Residential  Cottage Westgate is a very popular neighborhood for first time home buyers because of its location, aesthetic style, and low cost. In 2008 the average cost of a house in Westgate was 120,000 dollars. The majority of the residences in Westgate are single family houses that are owned by their occupants. The typical Westgate house is a cottage style with 2-3 bedrooms and is no taller than two stories. Most houses have either a brick or plaster facade as well as roofs with multiple peaks. This design helps to accentuate the homey feel of the neighborhood. The uniqueness of each home in Westgate as well as the community's emphasis on fa√ßade and yard aesthetics has attracted residents who enjoy the freedom to use original and eclectic design styles. Westgate has been described as \\"a nice neighborhood, with a family oriented atmosphere.\\" Westgates residents are very diverse socially but tend to be middle class and young. Currently there is a new wave of people moving to Westgate who are in search of a Clintonville home at a cheap price. Westgate provides these home buyers the perfect option because each of its houses is unique and full of character. The main problem that residents face is the public school system. Both the elementary and high school in Westgate are ranked in the bottom half of public schools in Ohio. Due to this many families move out of Westgate when their kids become old enough to start attending school. The residents of Westgate are actively trying to improve their community as seen by their successful attempt in forming a neighborhood association. Westgate is a quaint, young, unique neighborhood that provides a multitude of benefits to its residents. The Westgate Neighbors' Association is a non-profit community civic organization formed in February 2008. It is made up of residents in and around the Westgate neighborhood. The association's purpose, according to its website, \\"is to improve the viability, livability, and overall quality of life for the residents of Westgate.\\" Open meetings are held February, May, August and October on the last Tuesday of the month at 7 p.m. at Parkview United Methodist Church, 344 S. Algonquin Avenue.

It is dark green with a dark red shoulder and a maroon forehead and eye-stripe. Its underside of the wings and tail appear to be black when it is in flight. It makes a high, rolling cr-a ak sound. Groups sound similar to the acorn woodpecker if they are heard from a distance. The species is endemic to northeastern Mexico, where only about 2500‚Äì3000 birds survive in the wild. Taxonomy R. terrisi is one of two extant and one extinct species of genus Rhynchopsitta of thick-billed parrots. Description The maroon-fronted parrot is a large mostly green parrot which measures in length and weighs .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . (2011). The adults have a dark maroon brow which extends over the rim of bare yellow skin that surrounds the eyes. They have a brighter red at the bend of the wing. The tail is long and pointed. The underside of the wings are blackish. The juvenile has a pale beak, whitish eye-rings, and lack the dark maroon stripe over each eye.BirdLife Species Factsheet. Distribution and habitat Maroon-fronted parrots live in mature pine, mixed conifer, and pine-oak forests from 2000 to 3500 meters. This bird is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental in Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila and Tamaulipas, Mexico. Behaviour They nest in limestone cliffs near moving water in large colonies. Breeding coincides with the fruition of pines, which is its main food source. They lay one to three eggs in July and the juveniles fledge around November. They migrate over short distances seasonally. Conservation This bird is considered endangered due to overgrazing and habitat destruction. The ITESM Campus Monterrey carry out environmental education programs and science research in Cumbres de Monterrey National Park and Sierra de Arteaga for the conservation of maroon-fronted parrots.

Geography  The East Sudanian savanna is the eastern half of the Sudanian savanna belt which runs east and west across Africa. The eastern lies east of the Cameroon Highlands, and west of the Ethiopian Highlands. The Sahel belt of drier acacia savanna lies to the north, and beyond that is the Sahara Desert. More humid forest-savanna mosaic ecoregions lie to the south. The Sudd flooded grasslands in South Sudan divide the ecoregion into eastern and western blocks. The land is mainly flat, although there are some hillier sections around Lake Albert and in western Ethiopia. * the western block covers portions of northern Cameroon, southernmost Chad, northern Central African Republic, and southeastern South Sudan. It is bounded on the south by the Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion. * the eastern block lies in a belt stretching from northern Uganda along the Sudan- Ethiopia border region, bounded on the east by the western lowlands of Ethiopia, on the southeast by the Northern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets ecoregion, on the south by the Victoria Basin forest-savanna mosaic in Uganda, and on the southwest by the Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic. Climate The climate is tropical with a rainy season (from April to October) and a dry season.  Flora  Typical species are deciduous Terminalia trees with and undergrowth of shrubs and grasses such as Combretum and tall elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum). There are more than 1,000 endemic plant species.  Fauna  Threatened species include the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) (in Chad and the CAE), East African wild dog (Lycaon pictus lupinus), Northeast African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), African leopard (Panthera pardus paruds), lion (Panthera leo), and giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus).  Urban areas and settlements  In Cameroon the region is more or less contiguous with the North Region, where B√©nou√© National Park and Bouba Njida National Park contain some of the endangered species mentioned above. In Chad East Sudanian savanna covers the south including the industrial city of Moundou, Chad's second largest city, the oil town of Doba and the cotton-growing towns of Sarh and Pala. In the Central African Republic the region covers the sparsely populated north of the country, the larger towns include Bossangoa. In Sudan west of the Sudd swamp east Sudanian savanna covers the Bahr el Ghazal area including the town of Wau. East of the Sudd the ecoregion runs north to south from northern Uganda, through south-eastern Sudan east of the White Nile (including the area around the southern cities of Juba and Eastern Equatoria around Torit), and up along the Sudan-Ethiopia border. Here in Gambela is the proposed Gambela National Park. Much of this area has seen combat in recent decades and is in various states of reconstruction.  Threats and preservation  Seasonal cultivation and herding are lifestyles which lead the population of the savanna to overgraze, overharvest the trees for firewood or charcoal and cause fires. This has reduced the woodland considerably. However large areas of unspoilt habitat remain even outside protected areas, especially compared with the more heavily populated West Sudanian Savanna. Poaching is another problem, indeed the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) were formerly native to the ecoregion but have been eliminated through over-hunting.

Life He was born in County Limerick, Ireland, where his parents, Garret and Elizabeth (n√©e O'Dwyer) Joyce, lived in the northern foothills of the Ballyhoura Mountains, west of Ballyorgan. Robert had three brothers: Michael, John and Patrick, a noted scholar. The family claimed descent from one Se√°n M√≥r Seoighe (fl. 1680), a stonemason from Connemara, County Galway. Robert Joyce became a civil servant and succeeded his brother Patrick as principal of the Model School, Clonmel. He was a collector of Irish traditional music and contributed many airs, which were included in The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland, published in 1855. To finance his studies he contributed poems, stories and articles to a number of periodicals, including the Nation and the Harp. He produced a volume of poems, but remains most famous for contributions to Irish music. \\"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\\", \\"The Blacksmith of Limerick\\", and \\"The Boys of Wexford\\" are some of his better-known works.https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/j/jackson- joyce.html He studied medicine in Queens College, Cork and became a doctor in 1865.

Its name is in honour of the Scottish mathematician Matthew Stewart, who published the theorem in 1746. \\"Proposition II\\"  Statement  Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Let d be the length of a cevian to the side of length a. If the cevian divides the side of length a into two segments of length m and n, with m adjacent to c and n adjacent to b, then Stewart's theorem states that :b^2m + c^2n = a(d^2 + mn). The theorem may be written more symmetrically using signed lengths of segments. That is, take the length AB to be positive or negative according to whether A is to the left or right of B in some fixed orientation of the line. In this formulation, the theorem states that if A, B, and C are colinear points, and P is any point, then :PA^2\\\\cdot BC+PB^2\\\\cdot CA+PC^2\\\\cdot AB + AB\\\\cdot BC\\\\cdot CA =0. In the special case that the cevian is the median (that is, it divides the opposite side into two segments of equal length), the result is known as Apollonius' theorem. A common mnemonic used by students to memorize the theorem is: A man and his dad put a bomb in the sink (man+dad=bmb+cnc)  Proof  Diagram of Stewart's theorem The theorem can be proved as an application of the law of cosines. Let Œ∏ be the angle between m and d and Œ∏‚Ä≤ the angle between n and d. Then Œ∏‚Ä≤ is the supplement of Œ∏, and so . Applying the law of cosines in the two small triangles using angles Œ∏ and Œ∏‚Ä≤ produces : \\\\begin{align} c^2 &= m^2 + d^2 - 2dm\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ b^2 &= n^2 + d^2 - 2dn\\\\cos\\\\theta' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= n^2 + d^2 + 2dn\\\\cos\\\\theta.\\\\, \\\\end{align} Multiplying the first equation by n and the third equation by m and adding them eliminates . One obtains : \\\\begin{align} &b;^2m + c^2n \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= nm^2 + n^2m + (m+n)d^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (m+n)(mn + d^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a(mn + d^2), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} which is the required equation. Alternatively, the theorem can be proved by drawing a perpendicular from the vertex of the triangle to the base and using the Pythagorean theorem to write the distances b, c, and d in terms of the altitude. The left and right hand sides of the equation then reduce algebraically to the same expression. History According to , Stewart published the result in 1746 when he was a candidate to replace Colin Maclaurin as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. state that the result was probably known to Archimedes around 300 B.C.E. They go on to say (mistakenly) that the first known proof was provided by R. Simson in 1751. state that the result is used by Simson in 1748 and by Simpson in 1752, and its first appearance in Europe given by Lazare Carnot in 1803.

Columbia University Press, New York 2004 (pp. 159-167) and became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene about 12,000 years ago or even during the Holocene, some 4,000 years ago.Ronald M. Nowak: Walker's Mammals of the World. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999 Taxonomy The genus was first described by Hans Reck in 1928 to house his new species P. oldowayensis, which he described from bones originally found by him in Olduvai Gorge in northern German East Africa (Tanzania) in 1913, the first ever time this famous locality was explored by a palaeontologist. Hence, the type species is P. oldowayensis by monotypy. The holotype is a fossil skull and assorted bones kept in Berlin. The first fossil known was a skull discovered along the Bou Sellam River near the city of S√©tif, Algeria, at one meter in depth, when excavating the foundations of a new mill, and subsequently sent to Paris by one M. Favre de Ribauvillers. This, now classified as P. antiquus, was originally classified as a type of water buffalo by Georges Louis Duvernoy, who described it under the name Bubalus (Arni) antiquus in 1851. With some awe, Duvernoy states of the skull: \\"c'est ... remarquable par ses grandes dimensions, qui m'a r√©v√©l√© l'existence pass√©e de cette esp√©ce\\". It was moved to Pelorovis in 1978. P. antiquus was then subsequently moved to Syncerus in 1994, which has been subsequently followed by many authors. The species P. kaisensis was named in 1994 from Kaiso, Uganda. Hadjouis and Sahnouni considered it to be closer to Syncerus in 2005. =Systematics= A 2007 study by Bienvenido Mart√≠nez-Navarro and colleagues of the morphology of the fossil remains came to the conclusion that Pelorovis is probably not monophyletic. These authors reclassify the early forms of the genus, P. turkanensis and P. oldowayensis, in the genus Bos. In contrast, they find that the late Pleistocene form Pelorovis antiquus seems to be a close relative of the modern African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). This approach essentially subsumes the genus as a synonym of Bos, because the type species is P. oldowayensis. A number of the authors of this study reiterated their classification of the taxa Pelorovis turkanensis and P. oldowayensis in the genus Bos in another paper published 2014. Alexandre Hassanin follows the interpretations of Mart√≠nez-Navarro et al., pointing to previous genetics work which show that the bovid lineages which produced the modern species within the genera Bos, Bubalus and Syncerus split from each other some eight to nine million years ago, indicating that either the fossil ancestors of these species have not yet been discovered, or that they already have been found, but are taxonomically misidentified. He further points out that Mart√≠nez- Navarro et al. are only looking for the ancestor of Bos primigenius in their studies of African fossil bovids, and that the Asian species of Bos may have been derived from other fossil species. Lastly, Hassanin notes that if Pelorovis is reduced into synonymy due to these studies, this also implies the other Pleistocene fossil genera Leptobos and Epileptobos are synonymous with Bos. A 2018 study by Tong et al. of the Chinese fossil representation of Bos primigenius uses morphology to dispute these conclusions regarding these taxa belonging to the genus Bos, as well as if they are the ancestral line from which Bos evolved, instead hewing to the traditional interpretation that the Indian Early Pleistocene fossil species Bos acutifrons is the primordial ancestor of Bos. =Etymology= The etymology of the generic epithet \\"pelorovis\\", chosen by Reck in 1928, is compounded from the Greek œÄŒ≠ŒªœâœÅŒøœÇ (p√©loros) in the sense of \\"monstrous\\" or \\"huge and terrible\\" and Latin ovis, meaning \\"sheep\\". Description P. oldowayensis skull Pelorovis antiquus, P. turkanensis & P. oldowayensis (from left to right) Pelorovis resembled an African buffalo, although it was larger and possessed longer, curved horns. Pelorovis probably weighed about , with the largest males attaining . This ranks it as one of the largest bovines, and indeed one of the largest ruminants ever to have lived, rivalling the extinct American long-horned bison (Bison latifrons), and the extinct Asiatic giraffid Sivatherium giganteum, as well as the extant African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardis) in weight. The bony cores of the horns were each about long; when covered with keratin (which does not survive fossilisation) they could have been up to twice this length. The horns pointed away from the head, each forming a half circle in the species Pelorovis oldowayensis and P. turkanensis. Illustrations of fossils of Pelorovis antiquus found in Algeria The horns of P. antiquus were even more magnificent. These traced a regular circular arc, with the bone cores of the first known skull reaching in length and resembling in shape those of the Wild Water Buffalo (Bubalus). P. oldowayensis was broadly the same size as modern African buffalo, but its legs were longer, and the elongated head of this species was reminiscent to those of the modern Alcelaphinae. P. antiquus was more robust. According to Auguste Pomel, who was able to examine numerous fossils in Algeria, in life P. antiquus reached in length from muzzle to the end of the tail, in height at the withers, and in height at the hindquarters. Distribution P. antiquus disappeared around 12,000 years ago from southern and eastern Africa. Fossil and archaeological evidence indicates that this species lived in North Africa until 4,000 years ago. P. oldowayensis occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and disappeared 800,000 years ago. The best fossils of P. oldowayensis are known from the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania; a complete skeleton of P. antiquus was found near Djelfa in Algeria. Ecology Pelorovis antiquus was originally recovered from a formerly flooded (\\"diluvien\\") area. With such vast horns, it seems clear that the species inhabited regions with few trees. Judging from the rock art, it seems pairs of the male animals (testes are illustrated) would fight by ramming each other's horns with their heads lowered -this is illustrated numerous times. It also seems to have lived in largish herds, judging from some of the ancient art of Africa. Uses Rock art of \\"great bubaline\\" from northern Africa, thought to depict P. antiquus A large amount of rock art has been found illustrating the species Pelorovis antiquus in the Magreb: in the Atlas, in the Sahara and nearer to the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast. The art is found in a wide band stretching from Tunisia through Algeria to Morocco. According to Georges- Barth√©lemy M√©d√©ric Flamand, two styles of art depicting the buffalo can be distinguished: a style found in the Sahara and the coastal/Atlas style. This art indicates these creatures were actively hunted with spears, possibly by the first of the Berber peoples.

It is unknown if it interbreeds with the other subspecies of canyon lizard found in the same region, but it is likely. Etymology The subspecific name, longipunctatus, is a combination of the Latin words longus meaning \\"long\\", punctum meaning \\"spot\\", and the suffix -atus meaning \\"pertaining to\\", which literally describes the laterally elongated paravertebral spots on the lizard's back which are a diagnostic of the subspecies. Geographic range S. m. longipunctatus is native to a narrow range in the Big Bend region of the US state of Texas and into adjacent states in northern Mexico. The holotype was collected on May 31, 1971 by R. Earl Olson in Presidio County, Texas.  Description  The Presidio canyon lizard is a medium-sized lizard, growing from 4.5 to 6.25 inches (11.5‚Äì16 cm) in total length. Its coloration varies with the soil color in its particular choice of habitat, varying from gray to brown, with two rows of dark, comma- shaped spots down each side of the back, and a dark line on the shoulder region. It has a fairly large head for its body size, and a dewlap which is larger in males than females. The underside has dark lines, especially under the neck and tail regions, and males have distinct blue patches on either side of the belly.  Behavior  All canyon lizards are diurnal and insectivorous. Their primary choice of habitat is rocky, unvegetated canyon lands with numerous crevices to hide in, and ledges to bask on. Reproduction They are oviparous. References Further reading * Olson, R.E. 1973. Variation in the canyon lizard, Sceloporus merriami Stejneger. Herpetologica 29 (2): 116-127.
