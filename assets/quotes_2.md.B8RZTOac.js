Released in 2007, it is a parody of the shape-changing robot genre, being at the same time a nostalgic tribute to the genre and a moral fable about certain human and environmental issues. Full of romance, melodrama, and epic battles, the book is not a simple collection of jokes or sketches, like in most parodies, but it has an actual plot, with ebbs and flows. The story follows the adventures of two groups of robots, the good but non-heroic Awesomebots and the evil but non-astute Fantasticons, which come to Earth from Electronocybercircuitron, a planet populated by machines able to change from robot form to vehicle form, to continue their war here. While the Awesomebots are led by the good-natured Big Rig, a robot that transforms into a tractor-trailer, the Fantasticons are led by the semi-cunning Shootertron, a robot that transforms into a gun.Review from MTV Splash Page.

The car was the first four-wheeler manufactured by Bajaj Auto, which was unveiled on 3 January 2012. In India, the Qute is not legally classified as a car. On 22 May 2013, The Central Government legally classified it as a quadricycle. It is unable to reach speeds of 90 km/h and is therefore only allowed to be used for commercial purposes to replace auto rickshaws.  History  In 2010, Bajaj Auto announced the cooperation with Renault and Nissan Motor to develop of a US$2,500 car, aiming at a fuel-efficiency of (3.3 L/100 km), or twice an average small car, and carbon dioxide emissions of 100 g/km. Bajaj Auto first unveiled the Bajaj Qute as the RE60 on 3 January 2012, at the 2012 Auto Expo in Delhi. Bajaj Auto was best known for scooters and three-wheel auto- rickshaws, and is India's second-largest two-wheeled vehicle maker and is a world leader in three-wheeled vehicles. The Qute is Bajaj's first foray into the four-wheel market. At its unveiling, the company announced that the car had high fuel efficiency of and low carbon dioxide emissions. With a fare meter included in the base model's dashboard, the firm is targeting auto- rickshaw drivers by offering a four wheeler as economical to run as a three- wheeler, but safer and more comfortable.  Technical specifications  The Qute is powered by a 200 cc single cylinder engine with a capability to generate power output of around 20 bhp. The four wheeler has a metal-polymer monocoque body due to which it weighs 400 kg. Turning radius of the first four wheeler of Bajaj is 3.5m.

Floods What was a remnant of Ex-Cyclone Sid in the Coral Sea near Cardwell had produced a band of strong gales that slowly moved south between Cardwell and Bowen with wind gusts of up to 90 km/h, as it moved south into the Ingham area, Ingham had received around 295mm between 9pm and 9am the morning of 9 January. During the day, the heaviest band of rain kept moving south to be on top of the Townsville area, although Townsville had only relatively light rain during the day, (apx 43mm between 9am and 6pm), it was overnight that the intense rainfall caused severe flash flooding and high flood levels in the streams and rivers in the area. Around 335mm of rain had fallen on the 10th between 6pm and midnight and a further 236mm fell in the next 3 hours. Late into the evening, the heaviest of the rain was now falling and gale-force winds were continuing (at its heaviest, the rain was falling at 100mm per hour) as most streets in the city are flat, the city streets were underwater and blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Water was up to 3 meters deep through parts of the CBD and hundreds of businesses and homes were inundated in both Townsville and Thuringowa, plus around 200 people had to be evacuated. Black River was badly hit with 48 homes being uninhabitable, 14 homes destroyed and 8 being washed out to sea when the river broke its banks and at Bluewater 40 homes were badly damaged, while 5 other homes in the city had been destroyed plus 100's flooded, phones were out in most parts the city and fallen power lines and flooded substations cut power to around 50% of homes. A landslide, estimated to be 20,000 cubic meters destroyed 12 and damaged 6 units on a Magnetic Island resort and another landslide destroyed a million dollar home on Stanton Terrace and boulders were also loosened on Castle Hill and rolled down into Stuart Street in the CBD. Townsville was declared a state of emergency that night. Rain had eased a little by the 11th but still had some heavy rain pass through, Ex-Cyclone Sid, a weak surface low was still just to the north of Townsville during Monday 12 January and by midday the trough had redeveloped again and heavy rain moved into the city for the rest of the day. With many businesses closed due to the weekend damage, the new lot of rain caused a complete shutdown of the city and many workers battled renewed floodwaters trying to get home, even emergency workers had to abandon cleanup work for the rest of the day. On the 10 and 11 January, Townsville airport recorded 549mm in 24 hours and from the 11th and 12th through to the 9am the 13th 245mm fell, giving a 3-day record of 794mm. The period of the 10th to the 11th has since been dubbed the 'Night of Noah' by Townsville residents. Other areas around the city had readings of 895mm up to 1300mm. Aftermath The morning of the 11th has been described as the worst devastation in the city since Cyclone Althea in 1971. Most roads in the city were impassable; the Bruce Highway was closed to the north and south of the city as were all rail links as at the time they were still under water; the airport was closed to all commercial traffic as the runway was under water, and the navigation aids still out of order, electricity was off in most of the city and water was also off in the northern suburbs of Thuringowa, all sewage pumping stations were inoperable (one was underwater), Queensland Nickel's tailings dam at the Yabulu nickel refinery had overflowed spilling the pollutants into the nearby flooded river and out to the sea, one resident found two cars and a yacht in his yard, and sadly one person was confirmed dead, after being washed off a flooded road in his car. The total damage bill was in excess of $100million.

The battle occurred when the 11th Indian Division attempted to slow down the Japanese advance after the disastrous Battle of Jitra at a position 3 miles north of the village of Gurun.  Background  General Percival gave permission to Major-General Murray-Lyon to withdraw from the Jitra position after just a few days of fighting. Murray-Lyon believed he was under attack from far greater forces than he actually was and also believed that his line of retreat was threatened by the failure of Krohcol to stop the Japanese advance from Patani. Murray-Lyon was given permission to withdraw south to unprepared positions at Gurun. The terrain at Gurun offered a natural defensive obstacle for the British to use in the hope of stopping the Japanese advance. The retreat from Jitra, though, was a disorganised shambles that cost the division more casualties than they had incurred during the Battle of Jitra itself. Many units were left behind at Jitra when the order to withdraw did not reach them, but many more men and whole platoons and companies were lost trying to cross the Bata River and in the broken terrain south of Jitra. Some of these men would eventually make it back to British lines, many more were captured or killed.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Ben Hardaway. The short was released on April 13, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Jack Carr, who provided Buddy's voice, is a credited animator on this cartoon. Summary The film opens to Africa, where the native people do a series of strange things. One mows the grass forming the roof of his hut; another twists the bone in his companion's hair, then his mouth clamps down on and crushes a native fruit; still another throws his companions in sport, as though they were horseshoes. A gorilla attempts to hail an approaching car, driven by none other than Buddy, who does not stop, but rides on, with his trailer marked \\"Buddy's Variety Store,\\" whilst whistling \\"Marchin' Towards Ya, Georgia.\\" He rolls on into a native village, where the excited people quickly gather round. The trailer opens, the Africans take what wares they desire from the shelves, with Buddy's obliging help. In this way, So musical instruments, frying pans, and Roman candles get distributed. The scene briefly flashes to the same gorilla from before, then back to the natives, who fool around with their Roman candles. Buddy now markets his famous jungle bitters to the people, the consumption of which compels the natives to perform a musical number (\\"Marchin' Towards Ya Georgia,\\" again.) Our Hero then pursues a naughty monkey that has taken a bottle of Buddy's bitters. After searching around and under his car, Buddy finally apprehends the wayward primate, takes the bottle, and spanks the creature. Running off into the jungle, the monkey encounters the hitch-hiker gorilla from before, and tells of its abuse by Buddy. Walking proudly, the gorilla and the monkey enter the village after pummeling the native guarding the gate. The gorilla approaches Buddy as he inflates a tire; Buddy obviously fears the beast. After a brief scuffle near the tire and air pump, Buddy flees to a nearby guard tower, to which the gorilla chases him, with the tire and pump as a flail. The tire, upon being flung, bounces back, striking the gorilla and knocking the adversary into a tree. The tree bends backward under the gorilla's weight and sends the creature flying into the guard tower. The tower breaks, trapping Buddy and his rival under the rubble. The little monkey comes over to squawk in complaint. In response, the gorilla strikes the tire from before, which is still attached to the air pump. The pump's lever extends such and sends the monkey flying far into the distance. Buddy and the beast shake hands in a sort of triumph. That's All Folks! This is the second Buddy cartoon in which Beans the Cat delivers the traditional Looney Tunes valediction, \\"that's all, folks!\\" For more on this, see Buddy's Bug Hunt.

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on January 23, 2000. It was written by Jeffrey Bell, directed by Kim Manners. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Signs and Wonders\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.5, being watched by 13.86 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and punishment is dealt deftly, after a small town church is the site of a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be very much at all. Bell wished to write a \\"down-and-dirty\\" horror story about a snake-handling church. Furthermore, Bell wanted the true antagonist of the episode to remain hidden until the very end. In order to do this, the script was written so that Mulder suspected the wrong individual. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the theme of the episode was \\"intolerance can be good\\", in some cases. The episode used live rattlesnakes; at any one time, there were between six and fifty snakes on the set. Plot In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared Chirp, while attempting to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order to talk to his girlfriend, Gracie. Iris, however, refused because Gracie was in bed. Later that night, Iris is bitten when her staple remover turns into a snake; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear everywhere in the bathroom. Gracie is questioned by Mulder and Scully about O'Connor because she is a former member of his church. The two agents discover that she is, in fact, O'Connor's daughter and was kicked out of his congregation and home when she became pregnant. The agents go back to O'Connor's church and Scully is attacked by O'Connor, who attempts to get a snake to bite her hand but is stopped by Mulder. He is promptly arrested. Later, while in his cell, he is attacked by snakes and is presumably killed. O'Connor, who is revealed to be still alive, suddenly awakens in the hospital and takes Gracie, who was visiting him there, and flees. Reverend Mackey tells Mulder and Scully that Enoch O'Connor is the father of Gracie's child. Meanwhile, O'Connor takes Gracie back to his church and baptizes her. Suddenly, she goes into labor and gives birth to live snakes. O'Connor goes to Mackey's church and attempts to kill him, but Mulder intervenes and saves Mackey, wounding O'Conner in the process. In the ambulance, Gracie tells Scully that Mackey is the real murderer, and the father of Gracie's baby. He killed everyone to keep the fact that he was the father a secret and to destroy O'Connor's congregation. Back at the church, Mulder realizes O'Connor was innocent all along and confronts Mackey, but he locks the door and summons snakes, who promptly attack Mulder. Luckily, Scully is able to break down the door and save Mulder before sending him to the hospital. Mackey disappears to Connecticut, changes his name to Reverend Wells, and starts another church. The episode ends with a snake coming out of Mackey's mouth and eating a mouse, implying that he is not human. Production Writing right \\"Signs and Wonders\\" was written by The X-Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell, who had long wanted to write a \\"down-and-dirty\\" horror story for the series. Inspired by his informal study of snake handling, Bell eventually decided to write a tale involving snakes and an extremist church because it \\"would be scary\\".Shapiro, p. 116. Diverging from most stories that involve extremist religious sects, the main theme of \\"Signs and Wonders\\" is that in certain circumstances, \\"intolerance can be good\\", per executive producer Frank Spotnitz.Shapiro, p. 117. Bell \\"wanted the snake church people to end up being the good guys.\\" However, he felt that the toughest task in writing the episode would be successfully hiding the true antagonist in plain sight. According to Bell, \\"The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong. Because Mulder believes so strong it's the other guy, it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience.\\" During the snake handling scene at the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, the song being sung by the congregation is called \\"May Glory Protect Us\\". The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, \\"I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [to episode director Kim Manners]. I told him I could write one that was better and he told me to go for it. And I did. ... Kim loved it. ... It was a great tribute that he was able to ask me and accept my opinion on it.\\"Fraga, p. 98. Casting and filming The casting for \\"Signs & Wonders\\" was \\"rather unorthodox\\". In order to prevent ophidiophobia from hitting the actors on the day of filming, live rattlesnakes were brought in during the casting sessions. Ironically, many of the actors were \\"thrilled\\" when they got to hold the snakes, according to Kim Manners. He later noted that \\"the funny thing was that the actors couldn't wait to hold the rattlesnakes ... but we were still nervous.\\" Coincidentally, the father of Michael Childersthe actor who portrayed Reverend O'Connorhad actually been a snake preacher. Manners later noted that \\"he had gone to church as a child and handled snakes.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 177. Before production on \\"Signs & Wonders\\", the producers organized several safety meetings to prevent any possible accidents on the set. One of the first orders of business was locating the nearest hospital, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Fear of an accident was compounded by some of the cast and crew members' fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. Despite the precautions, an accident very nearly occurred when a live rattlesnake was brought to the show's set and escaped. It was eventually located hiding in Manners' office. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sealed with sutures. Special effects According to stunt coordinator Danny Weselis, \\"At any one time ... there were between six and fifty snakes on the set\\". During the scene where Mulder is attacked by a nest of snakes, fifteen live snakes were used. However, due to his fear of snakes, Duchovny himself was \\"not within blocks\\" of the shot, and a stunt double was used instead. Several faux-body parts were attached to the actors to simulate snake bites. One particular pair of fake arms, which was used for Mulder, was reused from the sixth-season episode \\"Dreamland\\". A false stomach was created for Tracy Middendorf, who portrayed Gracie, to give the illusion that live snakes were wriggling inside of her. At one point in the episode, Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, a famous painting by Italian Early Renaissance artist Masaccio appears in the background. Because the painting contains nudity, Fox's network executives took issue with the scene, forcing the show to censor the painting. Paul Rabwin later noted that \\"the network executive censors didn't feel it was appropriate for us to show all the details ... [of] course, they could see people giving birth to hundreds of snakes ... That's OK.\\" On the seventh season DVD special features, the painting is erroneously attributed to the famed Michelangelo. Broadcast and reception \\"Signs and Wonders\\" first aired in the United States on January 23, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 8.5, with a 12 share, meaning that roughly 8.5 percent of all television-equipped households, and 12 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 13.86 million viewers.Shapiro, p. 281. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 30, 2000, and received 0.61 million viewers, making it the eighth most watched episode that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e May 8‚Äì14, 2000\\", listed under Sky 1 The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote a very positive review of the episode, writing, \\"'Signs and Wonders' is a clever episode whose serpentine plot twists will leave many viewers genuinely surprised. Although a bit overly reliant on the alleged shock value of snakes, the episode establishes, more firmly than any before it, the demonic nature of some of the powers at work in The X-Files.\\" Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and called the episode, \\"one of the scariest episodes of season 7\\" before noting that the episode \\"really creeped me out.\\" However, other reviews were more mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that, despite several very \\"cool\\" images‚Äîsuch as Gracie birthing snakes and a man oozing reptile venom‚Äîthe episode \\"doesn't really seem to stand for anything.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 214. Shearman and Pearson further criticized putting \\"religion in the crosshair\\" and concluded that the episode was \\"just your everyday sliver of supernatural hokum.\\" Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the polarization of religion viewed in the episode, noting that \\"although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic‚Äîand distorted view of religion.\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing \\"I have always been the type of person who admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success. [‚Ä¶] This is precisely the mindset I'm feeling after watching 'Signs and Wonders'. I admire the attempt to spook me, to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness, even if I'm not completely sure what the point of it all was.\\"Kessenich, p. 107. Nevertheless, Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode's occasional quips of humor. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\". Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were \\"surprisingly horrifying\\" and that the episode contained \\"plenty [of elements] to recommend\\", she was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey. Although she had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes, she wrote that the \\"last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going, and in a way that hurts everything that came before.\\" Footnotes Bibliography  *  External links  \\"Signs and Wonders\\" at TV.com 2000 American television episodes Appalachia in fiction Television episodes set in Connecticut Evangelicalism in popular culture Snakes in popular culture Television episodes set in Tennessee The X-Files (season 7) episodes Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

Surname and family history Son of geologist Hermann Behmel and grandson of architect Paul Behmel. The uncommon family name is a Germanicized form of the Czech given name Bogomil from where (Bohemia) their family emigrated to Saxony in the early 18th Century. On his mother's side he is a descendant of Christoph Martin Wieland, a Swabian poet and writer of the Enlightenment. Life After working as a bouncer and a puppeteer in Paris, France, in the early nineties, Albrecht Behmel moved to Germany to complete his studies in humanities in Heidelberg where he was a fellow student of Silvana Koch-Mehrin and Gerrit Jasper Schenk and at Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. He has published on ancient history, Greek naval warfare and early German literature like the Nibelungenlied. Most notably, however, are a series of self-help e-books for fellow students, making him one of the pioneers of German electronic publishing. He used the pseudonym Timothy Patterson for two titles. He is noted to suffer from insomnia. He was a business consultant between 1995-2005. His published work includes novels, like Mitte 1, Homo Sapiens Berliner Art; radio plays, computer games, film scripts M - das Lifestyle & Technik Magazin, 1/2013. p. 24-28\\" and stage plays as well as non-fiction.

The first Samiel Award went to Austrian writer Jan Kossdorff for a dark humor novel about human trafficking and advertising agencies. The award is supported by publisher Marc Hiller of Stuttgart. Winning writers receive 666 Euros, the number of the beast. The Magic of the Swarms A series of paintings developed by Albrecht in the years 2013 and 2014. The Magic of the Swarms is about the fusion of shapes into more complex forms and about the interaction of colours. But it is also a geometrical game called Abstrahism: Intricate chaotic systems consist of simple overlapping elements. The colours help define the shape, but at the same time emphasise the intricacies of the interaction of each silhouette. The work is influenced by ecclesiastical lead lights and Buddhist mandalas. Real life silhouettes merge into something almost but not totally abstract - a swarm of forms that is more than the sum of its elements or parts. It is a way to perceive the world using techniques of geometry and cartography to depict motion and form. Expressive colours underline the aspects of contrast and combination. Three- dimensional bodies are reduced to two dimensions.Art Scene India, 9.8.2016Portraymag Exhibitions 2020 * Kunsthalle Altensteig * St√§dtische Kunstsammlung Jena 2019 *Baiersbronn Conversations 2018 *Chateau Savant, Cannes, France *Taste of Contemporary, Miami, USA *Gesichter einer Stadt, photo exhibition, Freudenstadt *Featured Artist at DMEXCO, Cologne 2017 *Dark Side of Marvelous, Beverly Hills, CA, USA, Solo Show *Acts of Kindness Gala, Manila Philippines, Group Show *Art Expo New York, Pier 94 2016 *Rathaus Backnang, 2016 (solo) *Convensis Group, Stuttgart, 2016 (solo) *Universit√§tsklinik Mannheim, 2016 (solo) *Al Madad Foundation, London, 2016 (group) *Landtag von Brandenburg, Potsdam, 2016 (group) *Carrousel du Louvre, Paris, France, 2016 2015 *Touring Exhibition, Berlin, Riga, St.Petersburg, London, 2015 *Evelina Children's Hospital, London, 2015 (group) *White Space Black Box Galerie, Neuchatel, 2015 (group) *Amrey Heyne Galerie, Stuttgart, 2015 (group) Style and motifs Two recurring motifs of most of his books are urban culture and the pitfalls of modern communication but also horsemanship and alcoholism or a mix thereof. Irish folk music, academic ceremonies and ancient mythology appear in some fiction works. Most dialogues feature a variety of German dialects and slangs. Some novels have been compared to the work of Israeli writer Ephraim Kishon. Albrecht Behmel, 2013 Political views The general standpoint professed in most of his non- fiction works can be described as libertarian, anti-establishment and pro- science with a general distrust in doctrines, political ideologies of whatever color. A recurring thought is that institutions like most governments, schools, churches and universities have not kept up with current social developments for decades, and in some cases, centuries, which contradicts their claim to leading positions within society.Review Faust Awards * Radio play about the life and work of Flann O'Brien: September 2003: H√∂rspiel des Monats for Ist das Ihr Fahrrad, Mr. O'Brien?

Today sinistrin is industrially manufactured out of the bulb of red squill by various extraction and purification steps. Biochemistry Sinistrin is an inulin-type Œ≤‚ÄìD-fructan with branches on position 6. It belongs to the group of fructans and is partly counted among the fructooligosaccharides (FOS).E. Nitsch, W. Iwanov und K. Lederer: Molecular characterization of Sinistrin. Carbohydrate Research 72 (1979) 1-12. Sinistrin is composed out of fructose units (97%) and glucose units (3%, approximately), building a chain of fructose molecules with a terminal glucose unit. The degree of polymerisation (dp) of sinistrin is in average at 15, the molecular weight is at 3500 Da with a range from 2000 to 6000 Da.T. Spies, W. Praznik, A. Hofinger, F. Altmann, E. Nitsch, R. Wutka: Carbohydr. Res. 235 (1992) 221‚Äì230. The main differences between sinistrin and inulin are the higher alkali-resistance and the better water solubility (even in cold water) of sinistrin compared to inulin. Uses Medical Like inulin the polymer sinistrin is not metabolized in human blood and passes the kidneys unchanged. Both, inulin and sinistrin, are therefore frequently used for the diagnosis of kidney disorders. An important measure of kidney function is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per time unit.  \\"Glomerular Filtration Rate\\" To measure this parameter, a marker substance is injected into the blood stream, and its rate of excretion in urine is compared to the plasma concentration. Such a marker substance needs to be non-toxic, not endogenous in the circulation, neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the kidney, and measurable. The measurement of the sinistrin- clearance is used to exactly determine the GFR in humans.B. Watschinger und I. Kobinger: Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr Innere Medizin 45 (1964) 219-228.T. Buclin, A. Pechere-Bertschi, R. Sechaud et al.: Sinistrin clearance for determination of glomerular filtration rate: a reappraisal of various approaches using a new analytical method. J Clin Pharmacol 1997;37:679‚Äì92. 204‚Äì211. The assays to determine sinistrin in urine or plasma are identical to that used for inulin. However, sinistrin is often preferred to the alternative, inulin, because it is highly soluble in water and easier to handle. For the application as a renal diagnostic an aqueous solution of sinistrin is approved under the trade name ‚ÄûInutest‚Äú.Inutest 25% Ampullen (PDF) bei pharmazie.com, accessed on June 7th 2011.

The commission was based at the Wales Office Cardiff headquarters, at Cardiff Bay and met for the first time on 4 November 2011 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. The commission reviewed the case for the devolution of fiscal powers to the Welsh Assembly and considered the case for increasing the powers of the assembly. It published its findings in two parts. Membership The commission had 7 members including representatives from the political parties represented in the Welsh Assembly: *Paul Silk (Chair) *Dyfrig John CBE (Chairman of the Principality Building Society) *Professor Noel Lloyd CBE (former Vice-Chancellor of Aberystwyth University) *Professor Nick Bourne (Welsh Conservatives) *Sue Essex (Welsh Labour) *Rob Humphreys (Welsh Liberal Democrats) *Dr Eurfyl ap Gwilym (Plaid Cymru) Terms of reference The terms of reference for the commission were: *To review the case for the devolution of fiscal powers to the National Assembly for Wales and to recommend a package of powers that would improve the financial accountability of the Assembly, which are consistent with the United Kingdom‚Äôs fiscal objectives and are likely to have a wide degree of support. *To review the powers of the National Assembly for Wales in the light of experience and to recommend modifications to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the United Kingdom Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales to better serve the people of Wales.  Part I  In November 2012 the commission reported on the fiscal powers question. It made 33 recommendations designed to give the Welsh government responsibility for raising around one quarter of its budget. The commission's first report was implemented by the Wales Act 2014. Devolution of tax-raising powers is to begin with smaller taxes such as Stamp Duty in 2018, and by 2020 the Welsh government is to have the power to vary income tax, following a referendum.  Part II  The commission was initially planned to report on the assembly powers question by the end of 2013 but this deadline was extended and the report was published in March 2014. It was commonly known as \\"Silk II\\". It made 61 recommendations including: * An increase in the number of Assembly Members at the National Assembly to deal with an ‚Äúoverstretched‚Äù legislature which ‚Äúcauses problems for effective governance‚Äù. It was hinted that there should be ‚Äúat least‚Äù 80 Members (20 more than present) as called for by the Richard Commission report published in 2004. * An increase in the National Assembly's power to decide on energy projects in Wales, raising the limit to 350 megawatts (up from the current limit of 50 MW). * Regionalisation of governance of the BBC Trust and responsibility for spending for S4C. * Devolution of responsibility over the water industry. * Devolution of regulatory powers over transport including ports, rail, buses and taxis and a greater say in determining the rail franchise. * Devolution of responsibility for drink-drive and speed limits. * Devolution of policing to Wales as in Scotland and Northern Ireland. * Devolution of youth justice. The devolution of criminal justice as a whole should be reviewed in 10 years' time to see whether distinct Welsh law had developed to merit it. *A Scottish-style ‚Äúreserved powers‚Äù model for the constitution. A list of policy areas should be reserved to UK jurisdiction, with everything else considered devolved. This is the reverse of the current system where a list of issues is devolved and everything else is considered reserved to the UK. The current system has been criticised for creating confusion over the extent of the National Assembly‚Äôs powers, with three bills passed by it referred to the Supreme Court in London. The majority of the recommendations of Silk II went into the St David's Day Agreement, which was announced on 27 February 2015, and also into command paper Powers for a Purpose: Towards a Lasting Devolution Settlement for Wales. After the 2015 United Kingdom general election a Wales Bill was announced with the purpose of carrying forward the implementation of the recommendations into legislation.  Reaction  The second part of the commission report was more controversial than the first. Concern was expressed by both the Welsh Government and UK politicians about perceived public opposition to an increase in the number of politicians. UK Ministers had argued against ‚Äúradical change‚Äù to the devolution settlement in their own submission to the commission, leading to concerns that the UK government might not implement the recommendations. Secretary of State for Wales, David Jones said: > ‚ÄúWe will consider implementing some of the changes the Commission has > recommended during this Parliament. But there is insufficient time remaining > in this Parliament to implement any changes that require primary > legislation. These will therefore be a matter for the next Government and > Parliament, and for political parties to set out their proposals and > intentions to the electorate ahead of the General Election in 2015.‚Äù The proposals formed part of the UK Labour party's manifesto for the 2015 general election campaign despite the suggestion of some Labour MPs that they might not.

Dear lives with her daughter, Lama-Sea Dear, in Totnes, \\"\\"\\"I am a painter with a simple ambition‚Ä¶ to create beautiful paintings. I make large, contemporary, figurative works. I am passionate about colour, shocking, vibrant and intense, continually exploring the power it has to invade our senses and influence our emotions. I work on large sheets of prefabricated aluminium, priming the surface then throwing, rubbing, pouring and dripping inks and dyes, glitter and glosses, to form a background. This is then sanded, scratched and distressed, depending on what image will be overlaid. I continually experiment with a multitude of materials, seduced by their substances, fascinated with their movement, individual textures and how they respond to one another. As the painting evolves, I become intrigued with the marks, how the line within a magnified face or body, organically flows. It is as though the image has, at this stage, become a vehicle for the marks. Selecting elements from a photograph and magnifying them to such an extent, creates a new dynamic. The finished pieces are stylised and ordered, the line defining the independent sections of colour and texture. My subjects exist on many levels, portraying innocence yet also the lack of it. The children are story book beautiful, their unique spirit captured and immortalised in that perfect state. By securing a tender moment or snatches of childhood memories, they are incredibly sensual, captivating, reaching out to their viewer. My nudes are sensually erotic, beautifully demure yet subtly provocative.

The ROC Ministry of Transportation Civil Aviation Authority acquired the aircraft in June 1985 and then leased it to China Airlines. On 29 December 1991, this aircraft, later operating as China Airlines Flight 358, hit a hillside near Wanli, Taiwan after the separation of its number three and four engines, killing all five crew on board. Incident The following times are all in the Beijing/Taipei/Hong Kong time zone (UTC+8). May 3 *5:50 AM: China Airlines freighter aircraft took off from Singapore, headed for Bangkok. *2:40 PM: China Airlines freighter aircraft flew pass the IDOSI reporting point, about 120 nautical miles to the southeast of Hong Kong. It followed orders from Hong Kong Air Traffic Control and descended from 33,000 feet. *2:45 PM: Wang Xijue () attacked Dong Guangxing () with an emergency axe, and also subdued and handcuffed him. *2:50 PM: Chiu Mingzhi (), who came back from the restroom, started to fight with Wang Xijue. *2:50 PM: Hong Kong ATC, upon discovering that China Airlines 334 has not descended to the appropriate height, ordered it to descend. *3:00 PM: About 50 nm from Hong Kong FLIR, Wang Xijue began calling Guangzhou Baiyun airport control tower, to the surprise of Hong Kong ATC. The ATC staff requested the final landing destination. At this point the aircraft was at about 15000 feet. *3:07 PM: Scheduled arrival time at Hong Kong Kai Tak; HK ATC observes the plane continued to fly north. *3:08 PM: Another crew member threatened to cause a dangerous situation on the plane.

Qiu Ming raised the flaps, risking crashing into the sea. *3:13 PM: Wang Xijue received flight assistance through official Chinese civil aviation, who called Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. *3:45-3:50 PM: Plane landed and pilots were apprehended, giving conflicting stories. Aftermath By forcing the ROC (Taiwan) to communicate with PRC (China), Flight 334 was the first step in the thawing of relations. It effectively ended the Three Noes policy and ultimately led to the reunification of families across the straits a year later and has led to officially establishing the Three Links that were originally outlined in a 1979 PRC proposal by 2008. In 1987 the ROC officially ended martial law due to thawing relations and other global realities, like the declining influence of communist aligned parties like the Soviet Union.

A graduate of Harvard Business School, Walther was a General Partner at Goldman Sachs until his retirement in 1994. He began collecting photography in the late 1990s and later established The Walther Collection, which is open to the public at its museum campus in Neu-Ulm, Germany and its Project Space in New York City.  Life and career  Artur Walther was born in 1948 in Ulm, Germany. He graduated from the University of Regensburg in 1975 and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1977. Working in the field of international investment banking, Walther established one of the first groups focused on interest and currency swaps on Wall Street and was a co-founder and co-chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. He became co-head of Goldman Sachs‚Äô worldwide capital markets group in 1983 and was the founding partner of Goldman Sachs‚Äô operations in Germany. Following his retirement in 1994, Walther pursued his interests in architecture, design, and photography. Walther studied at the International Center of Photography and took classes with artists such as Bruce Davidson, Mary Ellen Mark, Joel Meyerowitz, and Stephen Shore and became acquainted with Bernd and Hilla Becher. Fascinated by the practices of typology, taxonomy, and seriality, he began to collect photography in depth. The works of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) photographers such as August Sander and Karl Blossfeldt, and the industrial photographs of the Bechers, formed the nucleus of his collection. Walther joined the Architecture and Design Committee for the Museum of Modern Art, the Photography Committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Photography Committees of Bard and Vassar Colleges, and he became a Board Member of the Storefront for Art and Architecture and the International Center of Photography. As chair of the exhibitions committee at the International Center of Photography, Walther spearheaded the establishment of its Triennial of Photography and Video in 2003. Walther has participated in the Art Basel Art Salon series, contributed to Art Basel Magazine and to Mutations: Perspectives on Photography, and organized exhibitions at Paris Photo and Les Rencontres d‚ÄôArles, where his nominees for the 2011 Discovery Award, Mikhael Subotzky and Patrick Waterhouse, won the grand prize. In December 2011, Walther was named one of Art+Auction magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower 100.‚Äù  The Walther Collection  From the early 1990s onward, Walther traveled extensively and expanded the collection to include photography and video art from Asia ‚Äì specifically China ‚Äì and Africa, incorporating major works and series by, among others, Ai Weiwei, Zhang Dali, Samuel Fosso, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, David Goldblatt, Seydou Ke√Øta, Santu Mofokeng, J.D. ‚ÄòOkhai Ojeikere, Wang Qingsong, Jo Ractliffe, Song Dong, Mikhael Subotzky, Guy Tillim, Malick Sidib√©, and Zhang Huan. In June 2010, Artur Walther opened his collection to the public with the inauguration of The Walther Collection, a four-building museum complex in a residential area of Neu-Ulm/Burlafingen, Germany. Supported by the Walther Family Foundation, The Walther Collection is dedicated to promoting new scholarship through an in-depth exhibition and publication program. The inaugural exhibition, Events of the Self: Portraiture and Social Identity, was organized by Okwui Enwezor and integrated the work of three generations of African photographers with selections of modern and contemporary German photography. The second annual exhibition, Appropriated Landscapes, was organized by Corinne Diserens. The exhibition opened in June 2011, featuring photography and video exploring the effects of war, migration, energy, architecture, and memory on the landscapes of Southern Africa. The collection's third exhibition on African photography, Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive, opened in June 2013. Curated by Tamar Garb, Distance and Desire brings together late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century photography from Southern and Eastern Africa, set in dialogue with recent photography and video by artists engaging with the archive. Events of the Self, Appropriated Landscapes, and Distance and Desire are accompanied by exhibition catalogues co-published by Steidl. Walther opened a second exhibition venue, The Walther Collection Project Space, in New York in April 2011. In New York, Walther has presented exhibitions on Jo Ractliffe, August Sander, Seydou Ke√Øta, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, and the three-part exhibition series Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive. With over 1,400 works, the Walther Collection is considered one of the most significant holdings of contemporary Chinese and African photography in the world.

Decembrist revolt  On 25 December 1825 the Moscow Regiment played a leading role in the Decembrist revolt. Led by reform minded young officers the regiment paraded for most of a day in the Senate Square of Saint Petersburg, in protest against the accession of Tsar Nicholas I. At dusk they were fired on by loyalist artillery and routed. The officers involved were executed or exiled, and the ordinary soldiers transferred to line infantry units. However the Moscow Regiment, survived with its numbers restored by mass transferrals from the L.G. Grenadierski Regiment.Patrick de Gmeline, page 63 \\"La Garde Imperiale Imperiale Russe 1896-1914\\", publisher Charles-Lavauzelle Paris 1986  Uniforms and physical appearance  Throughout its history under the Russian Empire, the regiment wore the standard uniform of the Infantry of the Imperial Guard, which from 1683 to 1914 was predominantly of a dark green (eventually verging on black) colour. The main distinctions of the Moscow Guards Regiment were the all-red facings (plastron, collar, cuffs and shoulder straps). On the collars were worn distinctive regimental patterns of braid (litzen) in gold or yellow braid. In 1912, in recognition of its service during the Russo-Tukish War, officers of the regiment were authorised to wear a large metal gorget of a design dating from 1808.Patrick de Gmeline, page 63 \\"La Garde Imperiale Imperiale Russe 1896-1914\\", publisher Charles-Lavauzelle Paris 1986 A peculiarity of the Russian Imperial Guard was that recruits for most regiments were required to meet certain criteria of physical appearance, in order to provide a standardised appearance on parade.

Einzi Stolz, wife of composer Robert Stolz, remembered him thus: :\\"Leopoldi was for us all some sort of creature from a different planet. Through a salvation bordering on a wonder he had survived the horrors of concentration camps Buchenwald and Dachau. He maintained his belief in the good in humanity and remained an optimist, who gave courage and confidence to many in times of difficulty.\\"‚Äô‚ÄôHermann Leopoldi and Helly M√∂slein. In einem kleinen Caf√© in Hernals ... Vienna, 1992  Life  Hermann Leopoldi was born in Vienna and was taught the piano by his father, a musician called Leopold Leopoldi (born Kohn; the family officially changed its name to Leopoldi in 1911Czeike, Historisches Lexikon Wien, Band 4. S. 32f.) who also sought employment for him: Leopoldi's first jobs were as an accompanist and bar pianist. He married in 1911 and served in the First World War, establishing himself as a forces entertainer. His first major appearance was in the Viennese cabaret in 1916. By 1922 he and his brother were well enough known to open their own cabaret, Kabarett Leopoldi-Wiesenthal, which developed a reputation as a centre for such later celebrated performers as Hans Moser, Sz√∂ke Szakall, Max Hansen, Fritz Gr√ºnbaum, Karl Valentin, Raoul Aslan and Otto Tressler. After its closure in 1925 Leopoldi toured, appearing in Berlin, Paris, Budapest, Bukarest, Prague and Switzerland as well as Vienna. Leopoldi wrote the music for some of the most famous ‚Äò‚ÄôWienerlieder‚Äô‚Äô (songs about Vienna), setting words by Peter Herz and Fritz L√∂hner-Beda among others. Following the arrival of the Nazis in Austria on 11 March 1938 ‚Äì the so-called Anschluss ‚Äì Leopoldi and his wife attempted to flee from Vienna by train but the border to Czechoslovakia had already been closed. On 26 April 1938 Leopoldi, by now already set to travel to appear in the United States, was arrested and transported first to Dachau and then Buchenwald. In Buchenwald he performed his own songs for other prisoners, and most famously, in response to a contest initiated by the camp commander, composed the Buchenwaldlied (Buchenwald song) to words by L√∂hner-Beda. Entered by a non- Jewish Kapo, the song was selected as the winner, although the promised prize was never distributed. Despite its optimistic mood and text, the song was popular with the camp personnel as well as with the prisoners. Years later Leopoldi remembered that the song ::‚Äô‚Äôpleased the camp commander intensely; in his stupidity he did not see how revolutionary the song actually was. From this day on we had to sing the march morning, noon and night ‚Ä¶. R√∂dl [the camp commander] liked to dance to the melody, while the camp music played on one side, and on the other side people were being whipped ‚Ä¶ Through our work colony the song was brought to surrounding villages, and soon it was known throughout the land.‚Äô‚ÄôDas Buchenwald-Lied Meanwhile his wife had managed to travel to the US, from where she ‚Äúbought‚Äù Leopoldi‚Äôs freedom with a large bribe. He travelled to New York City where he was greeted by reporters: photographs of him kissing American soil on arrival went around the world. Rare among cabaret artist √©migr√©s, Leopoldi quickly established a successful career in New York, performing both German and English language versions of his ‚ÄòWiener Lieder‚Äô, and even running a musical caf√© called Viennese Lantern. This caf√©, popular with Americans but especially catering to the community of artists who had fled the Nazi regime, was according to Einzi Stolz (wife of the Austrian composer Robert Stolz) ‚Äò‚Äôan oasis of authentic Vienna in the middle of New York, where for a few hours you could dream of a Vienna that was so far away and unattainable, yet lived on in your heart‚Äù.‚Äô‚ÄôHermann Leopoldi and Helly M√∂slein.

His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included operas, of which three‚ÄîL'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)‚Äîhave survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works‚ÄîL'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia‚Äîwere completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas‚ÄîLe nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida abbandonata‚Äîwere abandoned by Monteverdi before completion; how much of their music was actually written is unknown. Background Monteverdi's creative life covered more than 50 years. Between 1590 and 1612 he served as a musician in the Gonzaga court in Mantua, followed by 30 years (1613‚Äì43) as maestro di capella at St Mark's Basilica in Venice. This timespan saw opera develop, from its beginnings as a limited form of court entertainment, to become part of the mainstream of public musical theatre. Before the Italian word \\"opera\\"‚Äîshort for opera in musica (\\"musical work\\")‚Äîcame into general use around 1634, musical stage works were typically termed favola in musica (musical fable), dramma in musica (musical drama), or tragedia in musica (\\"musical tragedy\\"); Monteverdi used these and similar descriptions for many of his early operatic projects. The Palazzo del Te, Mantua, seat of the Gonzaga dynasty who ruled the city from 1530 to 1627. Monteverdi was their court musician from 1590 to 1612. The first work now generally considered as an opera is Jacopo Peri's Dafne of 1597, closely followed by Euridice (1600), for which Peri and Giulio Caccini wrote separate musical settings. Ottavio Rinuccini was the librettist for both Dafne and Euridice. In the new genre a complete story was told through characters, and in addition to choruses and ensembles, the vocal parts included recitative, aria and arioso. This was a development from various older forms of musical theatre that had existed since the earliest years of the Italian Renaissance; such forms included the maschera (\\"masque\\"), the ballo (a dance entertainment, often with sung passages), and particularly the intermedio or intermezzo, a short dramatic musical episode inserted as a prologue or entr'acte between the acts of straight plays. Another format in the later renaissance period was the torneo, or \\"tournament\\", a stylised dramatic spectacle in which the main singing was performed by a narrator. Sub-operatic forms of dramatic music continued to thrive as opera itself developed; the blurred boundaries that existed for many years between these forms and \\"opera\\" has led to debate about how to categorise some works. For example, the precise genre of Monteverdi's Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (1624) has proved particularly difficult to define. Monteverdi's first acknowledged opera is L'Orfeo (1607). He composed, in all, 24 works for the stage. Of these, ten are usually classified as operas, of which the music for seven has been lost apart from a few fragments. Most of what is known about the missing works comes from surviving librettos and other documentation, including Monteverdi's own extensive correspondence. Tim Carter, a leading Monteverdi scholar, suggests that the high rate of loss is explicable because, in Monteverdi's times, \\"memories were short and large-scale musical works often had limited currency beyond their immediate circumstances\\". For Mantua Monteverdi wrote six acknowledged operas for the Mantua court, of which only L'Orfeo survives with libretto and music intact. Four of the five lost Mantuan works were written after the composer had left the service of the Gonzagas in 1612 and was ensconced in Venice, but still retained contacts with Mantua. L'Arianna and Andromeda were completed and performed; the others were all abandoned incomplete. L'Arianna (1607‚Äì08) (English: \\"Ariadne\\") Bacchus and Ariadne, Titian L'Arianna was composed as a festive piece for the wedding of the heir to the duchy, Francesco Gonzaga, to Margherita of Savoy, in May 1608. Monteverdi received the commission following L'Orfeos successful premiere at the court in February 1607. The libretto for L'Arianna was by Rinuccini, whose literary skills had earlier impressed Duke Vincenzo I of Mantua after a performance of Euridice. The composition of L'Arianna became a fraught affair for Monteverdi, being only one of three works that the duke required from him for the wedding‚Äîhe had also to compose a musical prologue for Giovanni Battista Guarini's play L'idropica, and write the music for a dramatic dance, Il ballo delle ingrate. His life had been disrupted by the fatal illness of his wife Claudia; she died on 10 September 1607, but Monteverdi was given no respite by the duke. L'Arianna was largely composed in the last two months of 1607, an exertion that Monteverdi's biographer Hans Redlich describes as \\"superhuman\\". Monteverdi felt slighted by the lack of acknowledgement from the duke for his efforts; nearly 20 years later, in a letter to the Mantua court secretary Alessandro Striggio the Younger, he wrote that he had almost killed himself when writing L'Arianna in such a hurry. Rinuccini used numerous classical sources as the basis for his libretto, in particular works of Ovid‚Äîthe Heroides and the Metamorphoses‚Äîand poems from Catullus. After a prologue, the main action begins as Venus tells Cupid that Ariadne and her lover Theseus, fleeing from Crete after his slaying of the Minotaur, will shortly arrive in Naxos. Theseus, she reports, will then abandon Ariadne, as he believes her to be unacceptable to the people of Athens as their queen. Venus plans to match her instead with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this. Theseus and Arianna arrive; Theseus agonises over his decision to abandon her, but is advised by his counsellor that he is wise in his resolve, and departs. In the morning Ariadne, finding herself abandoned, searches vainly for Theseus on the shore, where she sings her lament. A fanfare indicates an imminent arrival; Ariadne hopes this is Theseus returning, but it is Bacchus and his entourage. Jupiter speaks from the heavens, and amid festive scenes Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality with the gods in return for her love. Rinuccini extended the libretto during the rehearsals, after complaints from the duchess that the piece was \\"too dry\\"; as a result the early scene between Venus and Cupid, and Jupiter's blessing from heaven, were added. Preparations for the opera's performance were disrupted when, in March 1608, the leading soprano Caterina Martinelli died of smallpox. A replacement had to be found rapidly, and the title role fell to Virginia Andreidi, a renowned actress-singer who used the stage name \\"La Florinda\\"; she reportedly learned the part in only six days. In his analysis of Monteverdi's theatrical works, Carter suggests that the lament may have been added to the work to make the most of Andreini's acting and vocal abilities. The premiere, on 28 May 1608, was staged in a specially erected temporary theatre, which according to contemporary reports could hold an audience of several thousands. The production was lavish; apparently 300 men were required to manipulate the stage machinery. Federico Follino, who prepared the Mantuan court's official report on the occasion, praised the beauty of the work, the magnificence of costumes and machinery, and the sweetness of the music. Monteverdi's fellow-composer Marco da Gagliano was equally complimentary, writing that the opera had \\"visibly moved the entire audience to tears.\\" It is possible that L'Arianna was performed in Florence in 1614; a projected performance in Mantua in May 1620 to celebrate Duchess Caterina's birthday was cancelled for unknown reasons. Otherwise, there are no records of the opera's performance before its revival in 1640 at the Teatro San Mois√®, Venice. In his study of late Renaissance opera, Gary Tomlinson surmises that the work's enthusiastic reception in Venice was a significant factor in Monteverdi's decision to resume opera composition during his final years. Of the music, only the lament survives. It was published independently from the opera in various forms; an adaptation for five voices was included in Monteverdi's Sixth Book of Madrigals in 1614, and two versions of the original solo were published in 1623. Other composers emulated the lament's format; Redlich asserts that it initiated a musical subgenre that lasted to the end of the 17th century and beyond. The libretto has been preserved; versions were published in Mantua in 1608, and in Venice in 1622 and 1639. Le nozze di Tetide (1616‚Äì17) (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga, for whose wedding celebrations in 1617 Le nozze di Tedite was commissioned After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea- goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna. Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought fully appropriate to the occasion. He began work on the recitative sections, but before he could start setting the more expressive numbers, the duke had a change of heart and cancelled Monteverdi's commission. Le nozze di Tetide was abandoned; its libretto and whatever music existed have disappeared. Andromeda (1618‚Äì20) A depiction of Andromeda, chained to a rock in accordance with the ancient Greek myth Monteverdi's next commission from Mantua came early in 1618, when he was asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620. Monteverdi's letters during the 1618‚Äì20 period, mainly to Striggio but occasionally to Don Vincenzo or Marigliani, offer various excuses for his lack of progress on Andromeda, including his duties at St Mark's, his health, and his obligations to provide ceremonial music for the Doge (ruler) of Venice. In February 1619, Monteverdi had started work on another Mantuan project, a ballo (dance with sung parts) to Striggio's libretto entitled Apollo. On 9 January 1620, still with 400 lines of the Andromeda libretto to set to music, Monteverdi proposed to Striggio that the entire opera project be abandoned and the ballo substituted. This idea was rapidly quashed; Don Vincenzo ordered that the remaining Andromeda music be sent to him forthwith. The final segment of Andromeda, an eight-part song, was delivered to Marigliani on 15 February 1620. None of Monteverdi's music for Andromeda has survived. The libretto was also thought to have been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name‚Äîlibrettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1‚Äì3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands and has not been published. Monteverdi recorded no apparent interest in the performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter that he wrote to Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative generosity of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court. Two abortive projects (1627‚Äì28) After Andromeda there followed a period of several years in which Mantua made little use of Monteverdi's services. Duke Ferdinando died on 26 October 1626 and was succeeded by Don Vincenzo, who became Duke Vincenzo II. Early in 1627 Striggio approached Monteverdi with a request for theatrical music, possibly for the festivities that would celebrate Vincenzo's accession. Monteverdi replied offering three options: first, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (\\"The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda\\"), a setting from Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), which had been performed at the 1624 Venice Carnival; secondly, a setting from another part of Tasso's poem, covering the story of the sorceress Armida and her abandonment by the Christian hero Rinaldo; finally, he offered to set the words of a new play by Giulio Strozzi, Licori finta pazza inamorata d'Aminta, about a woman who feigns madness for the sake of love. Monteverdi sent Striggio a copy of Strozzi's play on 7 May 1627; Striggio liked it and instructed Monteverdi to begin the music. =La finta pazza Licori= (English: \\"The feigned madwoman Licori\\") Strozzi was a Venetian, born in 1583, whose literary works included plays and poetry as well as opera libretti; Monteverdi had first met him in 1621. Strozzi knew Monteverdi's music, and had developed a strong appreciation of the composer's innovative style. On 20 June 1627, Monteverdi informed Striggio that Strozzi had expanded and arranged the text into five acts, under the new title La finta pazza Licori. Feigned madness was a standard theme in the commedia dell'arte tradition that had established itself in Italian theatre in the 16th century. In Strozzi's plot, the first known attempt at comic opera, the woman Licori disguises herself initially as a man, then as a woman, and then pretends to be mad, all as part of a strategy to win the heart of her lover, Aminta. Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga II, whose accession was the likely reason why Licori and Armida were composed Monteverdi was, at least initially, much taken with the potential of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability to play the role of Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting. For many years it was assumed that Monteverdi had written much of the music for Licori before its sudden cancellation; Redlich says the music was finished by 10 September 1627. The work's rejection and subsequent disappearance have been blamed on Striggio's disregard for Monteverdi's efforts. However, Tomlinson's reading of the correspondence suggests a different conclusion: Monteverdi, in his view, \\"did not even come close to completing the score\\" and may have written very little of the music. It is likely that he stopped composing at the end of July, having become suspicious of Striggio's true commitment to the work. Tomlinson suggests that, mindful of Mantua's earlier cancellation of Le nozze di Tetide, Monteverdi avoided extending himself on the new project, while maintaining a diplomatic impression of activity. Tomlinson writes: \\"[I]t would hardly be surprising if Monteverdi were preternaturally sensitive to signs of Mantuan vacillation [and] if, at the first such signs in 1627, he decided to move cautiously in the composition of Licori.\\" Strozzi's libretto has vanished along with whatever music Monteverdi managed to write, but Strozzi wrote a second libretto under the same name, which was set by Francesco Sacrati and produced in Venice in 1641. =Armida abbandonata= (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") Torquato Tasso, from whose poetic works Monteverdi often found inspiration After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible. Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento. Plans for Armidas performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy patron of the arts at whose Venetian palace Il combattimento had been performed in 1624. Licori and Armida were Monteverdi's final theatrical works for the Mantuan court. Vincenzo II's death ended the main Gonzaga line; the dukedom was inherited by a distant relative, Charles of Nevers, and Mantua was subsequently engulfed in a series of conflicts, which by 1630 had reduced much of the city to ruins. Monteverdi's last known letter to Striggio is dated 8 July 1628; Striggio died in Venice on 8 June 1630, while heading a mission requesting aid against the armies that were encircling Mantua. For Venice Between 1630 and 1643 Monteverdi wrote four operas for performance in Venice. All were staged in Monteverdi's lifetime, but only Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea survive. Proserpina rapita (1630) (English: \\"The Rape of Proserpine\\") Proserpina rapita was the first of the theatrical works that Monteverdi wrote specifically for Venice, under a commission from Mocenigo for his daughter Giustiniana's wedding celebrations. The libretto, by Strozzi, is based on the ancient Greek myth of Pluto and Proserpine. Symbolic rape was a common theme in wedding entertainments designed for Italian courts, intended in Carter's words \\"both to proclaim the power of love and to set proper bounds on female behaviour\\". The Rape of Proserpina, Luca Giordano In Strozzi's version of the story, an amorous shepherd Pachino invokes the aid of Pluto, ruler of the underworld, to cure his unrequited obsession with Proserpine. Pluto obliges by turning Pachino into a mountain, though promising his soul a place in Elysium. After being struck by a love-dart fired by Cupid, Pluto falls for Proserpine and claims her as his queen. Initially she resists him, but when Ciane her protector is turned by Pluto into a spring of water, she is overcome. Submissively, she vows obedience; the strength of her beauty is such that Pluto softens, and pledges that in future he will treat lovers less harshly. The libretto was published in 1630, in Venice, by Evangelista Deuchino. Surviving copies indicate that the original scenery was created by Giuseppe Albardi, and that dances were arranged by Girolamo Scolari. The opera was staged on 16 April 1630, in a salon of the Mocenigo palace. Carter is sceptical that, in such a restricted venue, the performance could have incorporated all the special effects stipulated by the libretto. Nevertheless, an account by one of those present shows that the occasion provided considerable spectacle: \\"[I]n the evening with torches there was acted and represented in music ... the Rape of Proserpina with most perfect voices and instruments, with aerial apparitions, scene changes and other things, to the astonishment and wonder of all present.\\" One small fragment of the music for Proserpina rapita survives, a song for three voices: \\"Come dolce oggi l'auretta\\". This was published posthumously in Monteverdi's ninth Madrigal Book (Madrigali e Canzonette a due e tre voci) (1651). Otherwise, some indication of the musical character of the work is discernible from notes in the libretto, which Fabbri suggests, indicate that the work may not have been sung throughout. The work contained at least two sung balli, one of which concluded the opera with words that provided a thinly disguised tribute to the composer: \\"Quanto nel chiaro mondo / su verdi arcadi monti / di te si cantari?\\" (\\"How much in the clear world / on green Arcadian mountains / will be sung of you?\\"). More information about the nature of the music and the instrumentation is included in notes within the published libretto. According to Carter, Proserpina rapita is a transitional work. With its emphasis on dance, and in terms of its subject matter, it represents the courtly traditions of early-17th-century opera. At the same time, in terms of characterisation it looks forward to the \\"modern\\" world of Monteverdi's trio of late operas, specifically to L'incoronazione di Poppea. Proserpina's temperament anticipates the character Poppea in the later opera; likewise Pachino may be a forerunner for Ottone, while some of the discourses in Proserpina have the rhetorical flavour of those between Nerone and Seneca in L'incoronazione. Redlich records that in 1644, the year following Monteverdi's death, Proserpina rapita was added to the repertory of Venice's Teatro San Mois√®, but he provides no details of performances. A second edition of the libretto was published in Venice in that year. Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia (1641) (English: \\"The Marriage of Aeneas to Lavinia\\") In the three years before his death in 1643, Monteverdi composed a trilogy of operas for the Venetian opera theatres following the opening in 1637 of the Teatro San Cassiano. Two of these three operas survive in complete, performable versions: Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640), to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro, and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643) for which Giovanni Francesco Busenello provided the text. Between these, Monteverdi composed Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia; the libretto survives in manuscript form, though no trace of the music has been found. In her analysis of Monteverdi's late works, Ellen Rosand links the three operas together: \\"[The] ghost opera joins with the two survivors to form a coherent body of works that attests to Monteverdi's position within the world of Venetian opera.\\" The trilogy encompasses a historical trajectory that moves through Troy and the birth of Rome to the decline of the Roman Empire, and points forward to the foundation and ultimate glory of the Venetian Republic. The common theme of the three works is the mythical power of love, at first beneficial but later destructive. Aeneas and Turnus, Luca Giordano Because of textual and structural similarities with Ulisse, it was once assumed that Badoaro had written the Le nozze libretto. However, Rosand's researches reveal the librettist to be a close friend of Badoaro's, Michelangelo Torcigliani. In a lengthy preface Torcigliani introduces his story, taken from Virgil's epic Aeneid, as a tragedia di lieto fine (tragedy with a happy ending). He acknowledges numerous departures from the original, including the introduction of a comic character, \\"Numanus\\". This was done, he admitted, because \\"Iro\\", an analogous character type in Ulisse, had proved popular with theatregoers. The text had been written to meet Monteverdi's requirements for emotional variety, thus enabling him, said Torcigliani, to demonstrate the full range of his musical genius. The principal theme of the story is the desire by Juno, who is feuding with Aeneas's mother Venus to prevent the marriage of the Trojan Aeneas to Lavinia, daughter of King Latino of Latium. She uses an evil spirit to provoke disharmony between Trojans and Latins; when a Trojan hunting party first wounds a deer and then kills a Latin shepherd, Elminio, there are calls for war, which Latino rejects. Aeneas, resting by the River Tiber, is unaware of these troubling incidents, though he is warned by the spirit of the river. Danger arrives in the person of Turnus, King of the Rutuli, an ally of the Latins whose love Lavinia has rejected. Spurred on by Turnus's clamour for war, Trojans and Latins fight, and Aeneas kills Turnus. Latino invites Aeneas to take the hand of Lavinia, who is delighted to accept him. In the light of Aeneas's bravery, Juno forgets her former enmity, and joins with Venus and Hymen to bless the marriage. The opera ends with predictions of the greatness of Rome and the distant future glories of Venice. Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia was performed during the Venice Carnival of 1640‚Äì41, at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo where it alternated with a revival of Ulisse. According to Carter the work was fairly undemanding in terms of its staging, the action taking place mainly on the banks of the Tiber with few changes of set. There is no record of the Venetian public's response to the opera that, Rosand asserts, was clearly aimed at their patriotic impulses, with its final scene a celebration of \\"the birth and marvels of the city of Venice\\". In a preface published with the libretto, Torcigliani refers to \\"the sweetness of the music of the never-enough praised Monteverde\\", but the libretto itself provides no specific guides to the music's nature. Ringer records with regret that \\"[t]he words are all that remain of this Virgilian opera, offering faint hints of lost melodies\\". Consequences Many of Monteverdi's lost works date from the 1610s and 1620s, and the manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. Carter cites as a significant aspect of their loss the degree to which they might have provided musical links between the composer's early Mantuan court operas and the public operas he wrote in Venice towards the end of his life: \\"Without these links ... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage\\". In an essay on the opera orchestras of Montverdi's day, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap between L'Orfeo and the next Monteverdi opera to have survived, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria, hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical years. Carter also reflects on the intriguing possibility, however remote, that a discovery in an unexplored library might one day bring some of this missing music to light. As of 2015 this has not occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer Alexander Goehr was performed at London's Royal Opera House on 15 September 1995, under the title Arianna. Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, as a tribute to the historic opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the Diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with that of St Peter and St Paul, Bolton by Bowland. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The west tower and part of the nave date from 1805. In 1897‚Äì98 the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley rebuilt the body of the church, other than its south side. That rebuilding also included replacement of the box pews and the pulpit. Architecture The church is constructed in sandstone and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, a north aisle, a south porch, a single- bay chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages, with a lunette west window in the middle stage. The top stage contains lunette-shaped bell openings, and the parapet is battlemented with pinnacles at the corners. Each bay contains a two-light window. The south porch is constructed mainly of timber. Between the nave and the chancel is a buttress. The south wall of the chancel contains a three-light window, and the east window has four lights. The west window, and the windows along the north aisle, have two lights each. Inside the church is a five-bay timber arcade. The chancel contains a double sedilia and a piscina. The stained glass in the east window dates from the late 1800s, and contains depictions of the Four Evangelists. Another window depicts Saint George and Joan of Arc, and beneath it is a memorial to the two world wars. The two-manual organ was built in 1879 by Bevington, and restored and overhauled in 1979 by R. D. Holmes and E. H. Holmes. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of three soldiers of World War I, and an airman of World War II.

Novice girls had to await promotion to the rank of kalfa. It was a rank below that of usta (\\"master\\"), the title of the leading administrative/supervisory officers of the harem. The titles usta and kalfa belong to the terminology of Ottoman guild organization and other hierarchically-organized corporate bodies. Officially slaves or service girls, these women - depending on their rank - could wield considerable authority and influence in their duties and were generally treated with much respect by lower-ranking attendants in the harem as well as by members of the imperial family. Among craftsmen the term had a similar rank: that of a junior master yet to graduate to usta status and open up his own shop. Imperial kalfas The kalfas in personal service to the monarch were called H√ºnk√¢r Kalfalarƒ± (Turkish for \\"Imperial Kalfas\\"). The Hazinedar (Turkish for \\"treasurer\\") were the high ranking chamberlain kalfas charged with supervisory duties in the harem. Also known as Usta, they ranked above ordinary kalfas and included in their number the H√ºnk√ºr Kalfalarƒ±. Their head, the Hazinedar Usta or High Hazinedar, occupied the second highest position in harem service, immediately below the Lady Steward. Notable kalfas Historic Notable women traditionally addressed as Kalfa include: *Cevri Kalfa, a slave girl who saved Sultan Mahmud II's life and was awarded for her bravery and loyalty and appointed hazinedar usta, the chief treasurer of the imperial Harem, which was the second most important position in the hierarchy. *Evanis Kalfa, a nineteenth century female architect, involved in the construction of Dolmabah√ße Palace. *Filizten Kalfa, a Kalfa in the entourage of Sultan Murad V. *Gevherriz Kalfa, another Kalfa in the entourage of Sultan Murad V.

He was the first businessman to use barges as transportation means to export oil out of Baku. Early years Asadullayev was born in Amirjan village of Baku in 1840. At his early ages, he helped his father in farming business. In the mid 19th century when the oil business started booming, vast territories around Amirjan and Surakhani, on which farmers worked, were bought by Russian businessmen Vasily Kokorev and Peter Gubonin with the purpose of building oil refineries. Remaining with no arable land, many farmers were forced to find work in the oil businesses. Shamsi Asadullayev started working at the refinery. In 1860, he was promoted to Deputy Director to Kokorev. Some time later, he became the subcontractor for oil and salt producers. In 1875, after earning sizable income, he opened a kerosene plant. In 1890, Asadullayev co-founded an oil company with several other producers. In 1891, he purchased three barges to export oil out of Baku to Russia via Caspian Sea. Asadullayev reportedly owned an electricity substation as well. Later years In early 1890s, he purchased oil rich areas in the outskirts of Baku. In 1895, there was an oil gusher in one of newly acquired territories of Asadullayev which lasted for 56 days. As his oil exports to Russia through Volga River increased, he opened oil refineries in cities located in the export route basin, among them Moscow, Poland, Central Asia, Iran. As his wealth increased, Shamsi Asadullayev made contributions into building the Azerbaijani navy. He also funded construction of mansions in the center of Baku. Asadullayev became an independent oilman, the owner of his own company in 1893. By 1910, Asadullayev had 37 oil wells, of which 17 produced oil uninterruptedly and in ever-increasing volumes. After the appearance of the Nobel Zoroaster in the Caspian Sea - the first oil tanker in the world - Asadullayev launches three oil tankers - the so-called three ‚ÄúA‚Äù: Asia, Africa, America. Asadullayev was married to an Azerbaijani wife. The couple had five children: Mirza, Ali, Sara, Khadija and Aghabaji. When he married a Russian woman, his children broke off the relationship with their father and he had to move to Moscow in 1903. His Russian wife Marie Goudime-Levkovitch (Moscow, january 26th 1878- ) was the daughter of member of Duma, mother named Prascovie Nicolaieff and father Pierre Lebedeff, having close ties to the Russian tsar. After Bolshevik takeover of Azerbaijan, Asadullayev fled the country. He died from sun stroke on April 21, 1913 in Yalta, government of Tauride, Russia.  Asadullayev‚Äôs houses   Mansion in Baku  In 1896, a three-story mansion was built by architect Ivan Edel at the request of Asadullayev at the corner of streets Prachechnaya 9, Gymnasia 183 and Karantinnaya 84 in Baku.  House in Moscow  Asadullayev bought two neighboring possessions in the area of Tatarskaya Sloboda, under No. 333 (Maly Tatarsky Pereulok, house 6) and No. 334 (ibid, house 8); the first section was intended for the construction of a large store (due to the death of Asadullayev, the project was not implemented), and on the land of the second ownership he decided to build a large building for the school. A four- storey house, which became the cultural center of Moscow Muslims was built on this site in 1913 financed by Asadullayev. Before the 1917 revolution, the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Moscow were native Muscovites, among whom the Tatars numerically dominated. Therefore, the house of Asadullaev was originally used only by the Tatar community. The house included: the school of the Moscow Muslim Charitable Society, its reading room, and after the February Revolution of 1917, it also became one of the socio-political centers of the Muslims of Russia. The House of Asadullayev served as a national cultural center for Moscow Muslims until 1941. In 1926 two Muslim orphanages (the heads of Timerbulatov and Khabibullin); school number 27 named after Narimanov with 210 students in seven groups (headed by Yusupov); Tatar Central Club. Yamasheva; central library of Turkic peoples were located there. In 2003, this building was returned to the Tatar national-cultural autonomy of Moscow.  Patronage  Shamsi Asadullayev is known as a philanthropist. He allocated funds for the construction of the Baku Real School building (now Azerbaijan State Economic University); established two scholarships of his own name at the Alexander Tiflis Teacher Training Institute, the largest in the Caucasus; presented one of his mansions in Zamoskvorechye to the Moscow Muslim community (House Asadullayev). He paid for studies of several dozen talented young Azerbaijanis in Germany, France, Warsaw, Kazan, Kiev, Moscow, Odessa, St. Petersburg and Kharkov (for example, in 1901, the first Azerbaijani graduated from the St. Petersburg Institute of Civil Engineers architect Ziver Bey Akhmedbekov, who became the author of many architectural monuments Baku). In 1908 - 1912, mining in the fields of Asadullayev ranged from 6 to 8 million pounds per annum (architectural monuments of Baku). References External links *Asadullayev mansion in Baku.

It is noteworthy for its extremely large dielectric constant (effective relative permittivity) of in excess of 10,000 at room temperature.  History  CCTO was first synthesized in 1967 by Alfred Deschanvres and his coworkers. While the structural features were known, no physical properties had been measured. In 2000, Mas Subramanian and his colleagues at DuPont Central R&D; discovered that CCTO displayed a dielectric constant greater than 10,000, compared to the normal dielectric SrTiO3, which has a constant of 300 at room temperature. Since then, it has found widespread usage in capacitor applications.  Synthesis and structure  Most compounds which form this crystal structure are made under high-pressure conditions. Pure CCTO, however, can be easily synthesized by standard solid state methods via intimate mixtures of the metal carbonate and oxide precursors at temperatures between 1000 and 1200 ¬∞C. : 4TiO2 \\\\+ CaCO3 \\\\+ 3CuO ‚Üí CaCu3Ti4O12 \\\\+ CO2 The CaCu3Ti4O12 structure type is derived from the cubic perovskite structure, by an octahedral tilting distortion as is GdFeO3. In both cases the distortion is driven by a mismatch between the size of the A-cations and the cubic ReO3 network. However, CaCu3Ti4O12 and GdFeO3 adopt different patterns of octahedral tilting (a‚àíb+a‚àí and a+a+a+ in Glazer notation). The octahedral tilting distortion associated with the GdFeO3 structure leads to a structure where all of the A-cation environments are identical. In contrast, the octahedral tilting distortion associated with the CaCu3Ti4O12 structure produces a structure where 75% of the A-cation sites (A\\" sites) have square planar coordination, while 25% of the A-cation sites remain 12 coordinate. The square planar sites are almost always filled by Jahn-Teller ion such as Cu2+ or Mn3+, while the A' site is always occupied by a larger ion.  Dielectric properties  Using the Clausius-Mossotti relation, the calculated intrinsic dielectric constant should be 49. However, CCTO exhibits a dielectric constant upwards of 10,200 at 1 MHz, with a low loss tangent until approximately 300 ¬∞C. In addition, the relative dielectric constant increases with decreasing frequency (in the range of 1 MHz to 1 kHz). The colossal-dielectric phenomenon is attributed to a grain boundary (internal) barrier layer capacitance (IBLC) instead of an intrinsic property associated with the crystal structure. This barrier layer electrical microstructure with effective permittivity values in excess of 10, 000 can be fabricated by single-step processing in air at ‚àº1100 ¬∞C. CCTO is therefore an attractive option to the currently used BaTiO3-based materials which require complex, multistage processing routes to produce IBLCs of similar capacity. Because there is a large discrepancy between the observed dielectric constant and the calculated intrinsic constant, the true origin of this phenomenon is still under debate.Research in Progress 2010, the University of Sheffield.

Moravian nobility were keen to expand the range of areas taught at the University of Olomouc beyond just theology and philosophy. Despite opposition from the Jesuits, the Emperor Leopold I authorized the introduction of secular legal studies in 1679. However, the quarrels with the Jesuits became so intense that soon the law Professors had to leave the University and continued their lectures first in private premises, later in the building of Olomouc court. They were paid by the Moravian nobility, and since 1709 the Professors were appointed directly by the Emperors. While in the next decade the Jesuits accepted the Professorate within the University, the Nobility was seeking to enlarge the education opportunities. In 1725 the Moravian nobility forced the establishment of the Collegium Nobilium ‚Äî the Academy of Nobility ‚Äî by the decree of Emperor Charles VI in Olomouc. The lectures were provided by Professor of Law (since 1732 there were two of them, since 1735 three), who was teaching also at the University, Professor of Engineering (who taught both civil and military engineering and architecture, mathematics, geometry and cartography), lecturer of languages (initially French, since 1815 also Italian, since 1829 also Czech), and teachers of dance, gymnastics, swordsmanship and equitation. In 1778 both the University and the Academy were relocated to Brno, however by 1782 both of them were back in Olomouc. In 1783 Emperor Joseph II merged it with the Theresian Academy in Vienna, which was however closed in 1784. The Olomouc Academy itself was closed in 1787. However, only four years later Emperor Leopold II decided to restore the Academy in Olomouc, and it was reopened in 1793. In 1810 the Department of Agriculture was established, and since 1815 there was also Professor of Natural Science. There were efforts to introduce also lectures of geometry, mechanics and practical chemistry, however they succeeded only after the establishment of the Brno Technical College. The Academy remained in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to Brno: here it became the basis for what was later to become the Brno University of Technology.

Whilst en route to Vlissingen, a Koploper-type passenger train derailed at about 7.15 near Hoofddorp. Five people were killed and 33 were injured in the accident. Two days earlier an international train from Amsterdam to Paris derailed at nearly the same location. Cause Background During November 1992, Hoofddorp train station was undergoing reconstruction, especially the southern section that was being remodelled due to the extension of the railway yards in the area. For some time, an S-turn was required on a part of the route. For the construction of this, a tamping machine came to Hoofddorp to construct this S-bend, suitable for 90 km/h. However, the tamping machine quickly became defective and the workers were required to build the curve with other materials. This meant that the arc jets were made tighter with this replacement material, with sharper bends and consequently a lower maximum speed. The work was completed by early Monday morning, the bypass S-curve being opened at a speed of 90 km/h. On 23 November 1992, the speed of 90 km/h turned out to be too high for this track section. After six trains passed the S-curve, with very sharp vibration, the dispatcher was asked by its superiors to apply a speed restriction of 30 km/h at 8:26 AM. Further inspection added a speed increase to 60 km/h. People being evacuated from the Paris-Amsterdam train, 28 November 1992 The first accident The first accident took place on 28 November 1992, when an express train from Paris-Nord to Amsterdam Centraal that was diverted through the Hoofddorp- Schiphol section, pulled by a NMBS HLE 25.5, passed through the S-curve at a speed of 120 km/h. The cause of this accident was the lack of attention of the train driver, who, despite having seen the speed warning signs, did not brake in time for the section. The 84-ton locomotive went through the S-curve first and its weight destroyed the track section, despite staying upright. The next three Corail carriages after the locomotive managed to derail as well. The train was later cleared out from the location. During the next day, circulation on the S-track restored with a restricted speed limit of 30 km/h. At 30 November 1992 the local speed limit was set to 60 km/h. The second accident Later that same day, the InterCity 2127 from Amsterdam CS to Vlissingen, made out of Koplopers 4224 and 4038 (making in total seven carriages) passed the same area where the international train derailed. At around 7:12 AM, the first carriage began to tilt and overturned, falling onto the ground at a 180 degree angle compared to the rest of the trainset. Five people died in this carriage. The rest of the train also derailed and stayed upright. It was soon clear that the track here also had no defects at all that could have caused another derailment, and the train had been driving too fast. The investigation showed that going over 85 to 105 km/h in the S-curve would have most likely caused an accident. The InterCity train travelled at 106 km/h at the time of the derailment, and its estimated that before braking, it travelled at 123 km/h (these being approximations, as the train was not fitted with a system that allowed speed registration). According to the driver, he received no instructions that there was a speed restriction in the area, and the investigation committee concluded that he had not read the speed restrictions properly. At the beginning of the week of the accident, the train drivers on the route section received a list of speed limits, in this case TSB 49 (temporary speed limits for week 49). From this list, the drivers would be able to notice that between kilometers 19.7 and 20.5, a 90 km/h speed limit was in force (and a further 60& km/h speed limit for freight trains). After the first derailment, a supplement was added to the TSB 49, becoming ATSB 49-I. Apart from explaining the initial speed restriction reduced from 90 km/h to 60 km/h overall, it also included a speed restriction of 30 km/h between kilometer marks 20.4 and 20.7 that was added due to the derailment of the Express train on 28 November. The latter speed restriction would be handed over to the train drivers by the platform supervisors. In the driver's own words, he was not aware of ATSB 49-I, however knew about the speed restrictions imposed by TSB 49, and claimed he proceeded with 80 km/h on the track section near the derailment, believing he could go with 90 km/h on that S-curve, even though the speed was limited to 60 km/h. However, the difference of speed in the train drivers' declaration and the investigators' result is because the train driver claimed he had seen a 30 km/h speed restriction sign. He had also seen the 60 km/h signs as well, but due to the higher cab of the Koploper, he assumed they said 90 km/h, and proceeded in the S-curve overspeeding. See also Nuneaton rail crash, 1975. A fast train also oversped in a section undergoing reconstruction, due to poorly illuminated restriction boards.

The book is the sixth novel by Miller and was released on 9 June 2011 in the United Kingdom through Sceptre, an imprint of Hodder & Stoughton. The novel is set in pre- revolutionary France and the upcoming turmoil is a consistent theme throughout. It follows an engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte and chronicles his efforts in clearing an overfilled graveyard which is polluting the surrounding area. Baratte makes friends and enemies as the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. Miller was inspired to write about the Les Innocents Cemetery after reading historian Philippe Ari√®s's brief description of its clearing and imagining the theatrics that must have been involved. The novel received positive reviews, particularly noting the quality of writing. The novel was awarded the Costa Book Award 2011 for \\"Best Novel\\" and \\"Book of the Year\\", and was nominated for the Walter Scott Prize and South Bank award. Plot A 28-year-old engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte is tasked with the removal of the Les Innocents cemetery from Les Halles, Paris in 1786 (the Place Joachim-du-Bellay now occupies the area) and the removal of its church. Baratte is an engineer with a single decorative bridge, built in his small home-town, comprising his entire career and, as such, is somewhat surprised by his appointment; he does, however, endeavour to complete his task. The cemetery has been in use for many years but, given the number of people buried in such a small area, the bodies have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. While scouting the cemetery before his work begins Baratte goes to stay with the Monnards, a middle-class family with a beautiful young daughter, Ziguette. In the cemetery Baratte makes the acquaintance of Armand, the church organist who continues to play, but for no one as the church has long since closed, the reclusive P√®re Colbert, the church priest who is mad, and 14-year-old Jeanne, the granddaughter of the sexton, who has grown up in the cemetery and is instrumental to Baratte's research. Baratte initially keeps his work secret from his acquaintances but they eventually come to know of his work and most accept it reluctantly though Ziguette, in particular, seems upset about the destruction of the cemetery. For the work Baratte hires men from a mine that he formerly worked in and also hires his former friend, Lacoeur to come as a foreman. The work goes well until suddenly one night Baratte is attacked by Ziguette who wounds him in his head. Ziguette is sent away and Baratte is left with permanent injuries including severe migraines, difficulty reading and the loss of a sense of taste. After the injury Baratte decides to move Helo√Øse, a known prostitute in the area, into the Monnard's home as his companion. Though all goes well for Baratte after the injury he is called to the cemetery one night where he learns that Jeanne was attacked and raped by Lacoeur who commits suicide in penance. Baratte is ordered to cover up the suicide by his superiors and a rumour develops that he killed Lacoeur defending Helo√Øse. Characters * Jean-Baptiste Baratte ‚Äì the protagonist of the novel; engineering graduate of the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es and overseer of the project; originally from Normandy.

English translation of the name is \\"The Heart\\". * Ziguette Monnard ‚Äì Barrate's landlord's daughter who attacks Baratte in the middle of the night, in opposition to his work. * Marie ‚Äì maid to the Monnards who spies on Baratte sleeping during the night. * Jeanne ‚Äì 14-year- old granddaughter to the church's sexton. * Dr Guillotin ‚Äì a doctor who is observing the progress of the excavation for research purposes. * P√®re Colbert ‚Äì the church's mad priest. Themes The alt=An engraving by Theodor Josef Hubert Hoffbauer of the Saints Innocents Cemetery and its church. The image shows the Rue Saint-Denis on the left, the church at the rear and the graveyard in the foreground. A burial is taking place. The novel takes place immediately before the French Revolution and, while not discussed in the novel, a number of sights and incidents foreshadow the impending events. Clare Clark, in The Guardian, stated \\"as Baratte's story unfolds, the impending revolution hangs over the narrative like the blade of the guillotine to come\\", identifying a number of auguries of the future turmoil; including \\"an organist play[ing] to an empty church\\", the local theatre putting on a production of Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro; and a cart displaying the phrase \\"M Hulot et Fils: D√©m√©nageurs √† la Noblesse\\" on its side (English: M Hulot and Son: Movers to the Nobility). In The Week, Michael Bywater stated he felt that the novel has \\"a sense in the air that something decisive is going to happen, and happen soon\\". Thomas Quinn for The Big Issue opined that the removal of the cemetery as a whole could be construed as Miller asking \\"whether we should sweep away the past in the name of progress\\" or if we should be \\"confronting set ideas about what makes us human in the first place\\". Miller also aimed to imbue the novel with a sense of anxiety, especially concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that \\"a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot\\". Bradbury goes on to state \\"that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold\\". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that \\"I'm interested in what anxiety does to people\\", \\"in what happens when they can't respond the way the world expects them to. What happens when our sense of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances? What's left? That's a very interesting place to be.\\" Another theme prevalent in the novel is death, influenced in part by the death of Miller's father, to whom the book is dedicated. Miller stated that \\"after the age of fortysomething, death is a taste in your mouth, and never goes away again\\". The reviewer for The Australian called the novel \\"a meditation on death and the frailty of the body and spirit\\". Development Miller first heard about the clearing of the Les Innocents cemetery ten years before writing the novel, when reading a book by French medievalist and historian, Philippe Ari√®s; specifically his 1977 work entitled L'Homme devant la mort, or The Hour of Our Death. Ari√®s' book did not go into a great deal of detail concerning this actual event, however Miller was \\"taken by the theatricality\\" of it and decided to write a novel based around the exhumation. In an interview with Kira Cochrane he stated the novel \\"appealed to [him] as being interesting, visually interesting\\", stating \\"it was when it all happened that made it stand out. It's the 1780s, a few years before the French revolution\\". Miller further stated that his father's occupation as a doctor also had some bearing in his interest in the human body, stating \\"I grew up looking at these things ‚Äì my Beano and Dandy were the BMJ and The Lancet\\". Miller decided not to include any French dialogue in the novel as \\"it is so pretentious\\" in an English-language novel, stating \\"I was afraid that my editor would strike it out\\".

The purification of the cemetery and the recent change in social mores (in relation to dirt and decay) being the most immediately apparent. James Kidd, writing for The Independent, stated \\"if this suggests one definition of purity, others are suggested by political undercurrents. Namely, the ideals that helped shape the French Revolution: Voltaire's call to reason, Rousseau's call to equality, and Robespierre's call to arms.\\" Cover Francisco Goya's etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monstersalt=Francisco Goya's 1797‚Äì1799 etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. The self-portrait shows the artist seated and burying his head into his arms, as owls and bats surround and assail him. The cover, created by Royston Knipe, was based on Francisco Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. It features Baratte in his pistachio green silk Charvet suit replacing the recumbent Goya in his self-portrait. Instead of the owls and bats which assail Goya in The Sleep of Reason, Knipe used ravens. The cover was noted by The Guardian writer John Dugdale, in an article about the marketing aspect of book cover design, as being unique in the current market. He stated that; along with the covers for The Sense of an Ending and The Tiger's Wife; \\"None of the three looks like anything else in bookshops\\". Audio adaptations A Sweet Talk production of Pure was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of the Book at Bedtime programme from 20‚Äì31 August 2012; it was read by John Sessions, abridged by Jeremy Osborne and produced by Rosalynd Ward. The novel was also the inspiration for two songs written by Bath based musicians, The Bookshop Band, namely \\"The downfall of Les Innocents\\" and \\"The Engineer's Paris\\" from their album Into The Farthest Reaches. Reception The novel received almost universal praise, with reviewers praising Miller's approach to the subject, his vividly rendered characters and setting and his eloquent prose. In a review for The Independent, James Urquhart found the novel to be \\"richly textured\\" and that it had \\"energetic, acutely observed characters\\"; stating \\"Miller populates Baratte's quest for equanimity with these lush and tart characters, seductively fleshed out, who collectively help to deliver the bittersweet resolution of Baratte's professional and personal travails.\\" Clare Clark, writing for The Guardian, found that \\"Miller is a writer of subtlety and skill\\" and stated that she found the novel to be much like a parable, stating that \\"Unlike many parables, however, Pure is neither laboured nor leaden. Miller writes like a poet, with a deceptive simplicity ‚Äì his sentences and images are intense distillations, conjuring the fleeting details of existence with clarity.\\" Clark goes on to say that \\"Pure defies the ordinary conventions of storytelling, slipping dream-like between lucidity and a kind of abstracted elusiveness. The characters are often opaque. The narrative lacks dramatic structure, unfolding in the present tense much as life does, without clear shape or climax\\" and found that \\"The result is a book that is unsettling and, ultimately, optimistic.\\" The Australian's Jennifer Levasseur found Pure to be \\"Well-executed and inventive\\", stating that she found the plot \\"Historically convincing, immediately engaging and intellectually stimulating\\". She went on to state, of Miller himself: \\"Miller is the calibre of writer who deserves to be followed regardless of topic, time period or setting because of his astonishing dexterity with language, his piercing observations and his ability to combine rollicking storytelling with depth of character.\\" Novelist Brian Lynch, writing for the Irish Independent found \\"The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a realistic fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults\\", stating \\"At its best Pure shimmers\\". The novel received two reviews from The Daily Telegraph. Freya Johnston found that \\"Miller lingers up close on details: sour breath, decaying objects, pretty clothes, flames, smells, eyelashes. He is a close observer of cats\\" and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, \\"Miller intimately imagines how it might have felt to witness it.\\" Holly Kyte found Pure to be \\"irresistibly compelling\\" and \\"Exquisite inside and out\\". She stated that \\"Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind\\" and that she found that \\"Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities.\\" Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated \\"Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work\\" and also noted that \\"Miller's portraits of women and the poor are thoughtful and subtle.\\" Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be \\"very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times\\" and stated that \\"Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy.\\" In a review for The Observer, Leo Robson found the novel to be somewhat underwhelming, stating that \\"It is disappointing, given the vitality of the novel's setting and set-up, that Miller fails to achieve corresponding dynamism in the development of plot and character\\", adding that \\"as a prose writer, Miller appears averse to taking risks, which means no pratfalls ‚Äì but no glory either\\". He found the \\"engineer's progress and his setbacks are narrated in a patient, tight-lipped present tense, and just as the novel rarely concerns itself with anything that doesn't impinge on the destruction of Les Innocents, so it rarely deviates from its obsessive regime of description and dialogue\\". He did somewhat temper this, however, stating that \\"It is one of the historical novel's advantages over the topical or journalistic novel that the benchmark is plausibility rather than verifiable authenticity. Success in this effort requires a capacity for immersion and a degree of imagination, and whatever his shortcomings as a prose writer and a storyteller, Andrew Miller is endowed with both.\\" Awards and nominations The novel was not longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, to the surprise of a number of reviewers. The novel did, however, win the Costa Book Award in 2011 for the \\"Best Novel\\" and \\"Book of the Year\\". Novelist Rose Tremain, writing for The Guardian, identified the novel as one of her two \\"Books of the year 2011\\". In 2012, The Observer named it as one of \\"The 10 best historical novels\\". It was shortlisted for the 2012 Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction, with judges praising the novel as \\"a wholly unexpected story, richly imagined and beautifully structured\\"; and the South Bank Award in the \\"Literature\\" category. The novel was also short- listed for the \\"Independent Booksellers' Week\\" Book Awards, which are voted for by the public through independent book-shops. The marketing campaign for the novel was short-listed in the \\"Best Overall Package\\" award by the Book Marketing Society in their Best Marketing Campaign of the Year awards. Pure was identified as an \\"Editors' Choice\\" by The New York Times in June 2012. The novel was also listed on the Belfast Telegraph \\"Your Top Choice\\" listing for the best book of the week. Pure has, , been listed twelve times; with the first seven being in position 1. NPR listed it as one of their \\"Critics' Lists\\" for summer 2012 in the \\"Rich Reads: Historical Fiction Fit for a Queen\\" section, nominated by historical fiction author Madeline Miller who stated that \\"this is historical fiction at its best.\\" Costa \\"Book of the Year\\" Speaking about the novel at the awards ceremony in Piccadilly, London, Miller stated that he \\"had no special sense of this one being the one\\" and mentioned that \\"it's a strange journey, you spend three years in a room on your own and then this: a little unsettling but deeply pleasurable\\"; \\"It's a very happy occasion\\". Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating \\"we were looking for quality\\". The judges were undecided over whether the prize should have gone to Matthew Hollis' biography Now All Roads Lead to France instead. The judging panel was locked in a \\"fierce debate and quite bitter dissent\\" and eventually used a vote to decide on the winner. Geordie Greig said \\"it was not unpleasant, it was forthright\\", stating \\"it's not like comparing apples and oranges ‚Äì it's like comparing bananas and curry.\\" Chair for the selection in 2010, web editor for Foyles bookshops Jonathan Ruppin, supported the decision, stating \\"Like Hilary Mantel, who finally became a major name when she won the Man Booker, Miller should now gain the commercial success his stylish and absorbing novels have long deserved.\\" He goes on to say \\"Pure perfectly captures the mood of a downtrodden and angry nation, on the verge of overthrowing a self-serving and out-of-touch ruling class ‚Äì it's very much a book for our time.\\" The 2011 awards were subject to some attention from bookmakers, who offered odds of 2/1 for favourite Matthew Hollis' biography Now All Roads Lead To France and odds of 3/1 for Miller's Pure.

It is the only known species of the genus Vulcanoctopus. Habitat Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis lives along the East Pacific Rise, the border of the Pacific, Cocos, and Nazca Plates. It is often found near colonies of giant tube worms. Description The morphology of V. hydrothermalis shows some unusual traits for an octopus, due to adaptations selected for in the deep sea, such as the lack of an ink sac. Its dorsal arms are longer than the ventral arms. These feature biserial suckers. Overall, it has a mean total length of . Behavior The ratio of recovered individuals is skewed towards males, indicating fewer females or spatial segregation by sex. Its primary defense reaction is to freeze in place, then if needed, the secondary defense involves pushing away from the bottom then drifting back down. V. hydrothermalis uses its front arms (I dorsal and II dorsolateral) for feeling its way around and detecting and catching prey, while the back arms (III ventrolateral and IV ventral) support its weight and move the octopus forward. This species has not been observed to use jet propulsion. Prey Its confirmed prey consist of the amphipod Halice hesmonectes and crabs, which are thought to be one of their primary food sources.

She developed one of the world's first high-level languages with indirect address in programming, called the Address programming language. Over the period of her academic career, Yushchenko supervised 45 Ph.D students. Further professional achievements include Yushchenko being awarded two USSR State Prizes, The USSR Council of Ministers Prize, The Academician Glushkov Prize, and The Order of Princess Olga. Yushchenko was the first woman in the USSR to become a Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in programming.  Biography  Kateryna Lohvynivna Yushchenko (n√©e Rvacheva) was born in 1919 in Chyhyryn, central Ukraine. She started her undergraduate studies in Kyiv University in 1937, and during the Second World War she attended the Central Asian State University in Tashkent, graduating in 1942. After the war she returned to Ukraine and in 1950, under the direction of Boris Gnedenko, she obtained a Ph.D. from the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. For a period of seven years, Yushchenko held the position of Senior Researcher of the Kiev Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences (1950‚Äì57). In 1954, the Levedev Laboratory (where the first computer in continental Europe MESM was created) was transferred to the Institute of Mathematics. Yushchenko was a member of the joint group of scholars operating the MESM. In 1957 she became Director of the Institute of Computer Science of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. During her forty years service to the Institute, Yushchenko created an internationally notable scientific school of theoretical programming.  Scientific contributions  Yushchenko is best known for her creation of Address programming language, the first fundamental advancement in the scientific school of theoretical programming. This language provided the free location of a program in computer memory. In the process of working with MESM, it became clear that the more complex tasks were difficult to solve by writing simple machine programs. There was a need to develop a high-level programming language, but there was a problem: the absence of an appropriate translator for better human/computer communication. L.I. Kaluzhnin, a professor at Kyiv University, who taught a course on mathematical logic in the 1950‚Äì1970s, made a significant advancement in the understanding of this problem and formalized a scheme of interfacing with the program. Following this development, in 1955, Yushchenko developed a programming language based on two general principles for the computer work: addressing and software management. Creating a convenient system of concepts for describing the computer architecture and its system instructions, the language thus became the means of manipulation of the second-rank addresses. Yushchenko‚Äôs contribution became the first fundamental achievement of the Soviet School of Theoretical Programming. Yushchenko was the founder of the first Soviet School of Theoretical Programming. During the 1970s‚Äì1980s, theoretical programming became a subject of research of its own. One of the major achievements of the School at that time was the creation of algebraic grammar methods for software synthesis. In the 1990s, the efforts of the School of Theoretical Programming were concentrated on the study of algebraic grammar-methods of knowledge representation model of computation, and friendly user interface for designing and developing databases and knowledge bases for decision support systems, expert systems and methods of learning for them. After forty years of research, theoretical programming enriched with its own formal-algorithmic apparatus and the subject of research, significantly expanded from procedural languages to methods of knowledge representation that form artificial intelligence tools for developers of application systems.  Work  Yushchenko worked on probability theory, algorithmic languages and programming languages, and developing methods of automated data processing systems. To prepare programmers, Yuschenko wrote an educational series of textbooks in the 1970s. Yuschenko held five Copyright Certificates, which developed eight State Standards of Ukraine. She is an author of over 200 manuscripts, including 23 monographs and train aids. Part of these works have two to-three editions, and have been translated to more than 5 languages internationally, including German, Czech, Hungarian, French, Danish and so on.

The company is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland and has manufacturing facilities in Bamberg, South Carolina. Rockland Industries has sales in the United States and in more than 90 countries worldwide. The Roc-lon logo was created in 1963 History The company was founded as Rockland Bleach and Dye Works in 1831Baltimore Association of Commerce by three brothers from England, James, Robert and John Wright, in the Rockland Historic District of Brooklandville, an area of present-day Baltimore, and is recorded as the oldest corporation in Baltimore County. Rockland Bleach and Dye Works produced premier cotton and Irish woolens that were used all over the United States. The current location of the headquarters and Baltimore manufacturing on Edison Avenue has a rich history, as it used to be Bugle Field. Bugle Field was primarily used as negro league field that was home to the Baltimore Elite Giants and Baltimore Black Sox from the late 1920s until around 1950. It was home to great players such as Roy Campanella and was also the site that several Major League Baseball players were discovered, as Bugle Field was owned by the owners of the former Washington Senators and a local laundering company that has since also closed. http://www.kilduffs.com/Sports.html In 1944, Alexander Leaderman, a decorated U.S. Army officer, purchased the company after returning home from WWII and renamed it Rockland Industries.Alexander Leaderman, 80, Industrialist, Philanthropist (November 8, 1999). The Baltimore Sun The new company introduced the concept of lining curtains with a specially treated fabric to prevent them from being damaged by sunlight and moisture, much the way linings protect clothing fabric. In 1963, Rockland patented and introduced Roc-lon Rain-No-Stain, the first brand name curtain lining ever produced. The product featured insulation properties, oil and water-borne stain repellency, as well as a UV inhibitor for protection against fading. Roc-lon Rain-No-Stain was awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval in 1964, the only drapery lining ever awarded that recognition.The Name Behind the Lining (March 1998). Drapery & Window Covering Magazine In 1966, Rockland capitalized on their success in the drapery lining business by inventing Roc-lon Blackout, the first curtain and drapery blackout fabric that blocked 100% of the light shining in from a window or other light source from passing through. Prior to Roc-lon Blackout, vinyl was used to block out sunlight ‚Äì however temperature changes would cause the material to crack, peel and turn yellow, and also produce an unpleasant odor.Schneider, Eric. Post-Leaderman Rockland Diversifies, Introduces New Products (December 12, 2000) Rockland spent years perfecting the process of applying thin coatings to their materials to produce a soft alternative fabric to vinyl. Rockland marketed its Roc-lon blackout as ‚Äòthe un-vinyl‚Äô, and it was a commercial hit. Blackout linings and fabrics have become a ubiquitous element in hotel rooms around the world. In addition to its commercial usage, Rockland‚Äôs blackout is also used by the U.S. State Department in embassies and consulates around the world, as well as U.S. government and military installations and service academies. Today, Rockland sells its blackout fabrics and drapery linings to the commercial hotel and hospitality trade as well as to the retail and residential markets. Rockland is the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer of drapery lining, with its success based largely on its long-running Roc-lon Rain-No-Stain and Roc-lon Blackout.

In the episode, Callie creates a clone of Mark that will guarantee the Department of Integration's win in a bowling tournament, but the plan backfires when the clone frames her for murdering Twayne's new assistant, Tad. The episode was written by Adam Stein and series developer David M. Stern, and directed by Richard Ferguson-Hull and series creator Devin Clark. The episode features guest performances by comedians Kate McKinnon and Jay Oakerson. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Attack of Mark's Clone\\" was watched by a season low of 730,000 viewers in its original airing. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who deemed it solid. Plot Callie Maggotbone creates a clone of Mark Lilly to replace him in the Department of Integration's (D.O.I.) bowling tournament, as the real Mark is a \\"terrible bowler\\". The clone, who has blonde hair instead of brown, has a sadistic worldview and hides the real Mark in his closet. The following day, Twayne Boneraper hires a new assistant named Tad to do his dirty work. Tad's first action is to reassign Callie, whom he thinks is a saboteur, to a useless department in sub-basement 37. Tad also cuts Mark's department's budget by 80%, but is rather impressed by the Clone Mark's attitude. The next day at his group therapy session with Mark's students, Clone Mark turns it into a fight club to train them for the bowling tournament. Later, Clone Mark finds Callie's diary at her apartment and finds out that she plans to murder him after the tournament and then get the real Mark back. Infuriated, he decides to murder Tad and frames Callie for the crime by using a trident from her apartment as the weapon and leaving it at the scene. Callie gets hauled in by Frank Grimes and his crew, but Grimes finds Mark's behavior strange and decides to investigate further. Grimes visits Callie at the prison, but she cannot reveal the truth because Clone Mark will kill the real Mark if she tells anyone that he framed her. Grimes goes to Mark's apartment and discovers the real Mark tied up in his own closet. However, Clone Mark appears behind him and shoots him in both his legs. Grimes, as he tries to fire back, ends up blinding himself. Clone Mark has grown tired of bowling and decides to leave the city. The next day, the real Mark tries to free Callie from prison, but he must find evidence to prove her innocence. Mark finds his clone at a tropical island, where he confesses that he killed Tad. The clone is then gassed to death and his body is scrapped for parts, which gives Grimes new legs and eyes. At the bowling tournament, Mark wonders where his clone came from, and Callie says that he \\"will never know\\". Production Series creator Devin Clark commented that Matt Oberg (pictured) voiced Clone Mark as \\"much more gruff individual\\" compared to the real Mark. Initially titled \\"The Clone Wars\\", the episode's title was later changed to \\"Attack of Mark's Clone\\". Series developer David M. Stern wrote the episode with Adam Stein, and Richard Ferguson-Hull and series creator Devin Clark directed it. Stein and Mick Kelly served as staff writers. In an interview with Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO, Clark spoke of the episode and proclaimed that it was a \\"really fun opportunity\\" to see what Mark's clone would be like, calling him an \\"Agro-Mark\\". He said that Matt Oberg, the voice of Mark, voiced the clone as a \\"much more gruff individual\\". Clark elaborated, \\"It's really funny. It's like seeing Mark, since we kind of play him so neutered most of the time, it's like seeing him as like this jerk, it's hilarious, it's a very funny story.\\" Executive producer Daniel Powell said that Clone Mark \\"glove slaps everyone [and smokes] a cigarette instead of putting it out before the office\\". \\"Attack of Mark's Clone\\" was the eighth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes and Mike O'Gorman. Comedians Kate McKinnon and Jay Oakerson guest starred in the episode. Reception The episode originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 4, 2011. The episode was viewed by an estimated 730,000 viewers and received a 0.3 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that it was seen by 0.3% of all 18- to 49-year-olds. The episode marked a decrease in ratings from the previous episode, \\"The Ring of Powers\\", which scored a 0.4 rating and was watched by 870,000 viewers. The total viewership for \\"Attack of Mark's Clone\\" made it the season's least watched episode. Critical reception of the episode was positive. Charles Webb of MTV Geek favored it over season one episodes, which emphasized \\"generating a gag a minute within a paper-thin plot\\". Webb wrote, \\"The Ugly Americans team has been on a roll much of this season, going three for three with this episode, last week's 'The Ring of Powers,' and the previous week's 'G.I. Twayne'.\\" Ology writer Josh Harrison was also positive of the episode, rating it 7.7 out of 10 and writing: \\"'Attack of Mark's Clone' takes a pretty archetypal plotline‚Äîthe evil duplicate‚Äîand translates it into the zany twisting storytelling we've come to know and love.\\" Harrison praised the episode for giving viewers insight on the character Mark, and concluded: \\"This was a solid, if one-note, episode of Ugly Americans.

Academic career After graduating in physics from the University of Padua in 1984, Giudice obtained in 1988 his PhD in theoretical physics from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste. Between 1988 and 1990 he was Research Associate at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago. Between 1990 and 1992 he was Research Fellow in the Physics Department of the University of Texas at Austin, in the group led by Steven Weinberg. After being employed by the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare of Italy, in 1993 he moved to CERN, where he is currently the Head of the Theoretical Physics Department. Academician of the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed ArtiCERN Courier, vol. 51, issue 6, July/August 2011.. and of Accademia Galileiana, he has been awarded the 2013 Jacques Solvay Chair in Physics.CERN Courier, vol. 53, issue 1, January/February 2013.. Research The research activity of Giudice mainly deals with the formulation of new theories that extend our present knowledge of the particle world toward even smaller distances. He is also studying how these theories can be applied to cosmology in order to describe the early stages of the history of our universe. His most notable results are in the areas of supersymmetry, extra dimensions, electroweak physics, collider physics, dark matter, and leptogenesis. Together with physicist Riccardo Barbieri, he proposed a widely used criterion to test the degree of naturalness of a supersymmetric theory that achieves electroweak symmetry breaking. He co-invented the Giudice-Masiero mechanism, which is the leading explanation for the Mu problem of supergravity. He has made fundamental contributions to the construction of Gauge Mediation, and he is a co-author of the first papers proposing Anomaly Mediation and Split Supersymmetry. He is one of the proponents of a method to compute quantum effects in theories with broken supersymmetry through analytic continuation into superspace. Well known and much used in LHC studies is his method to describe graviton interactions in theories with extra spatial dimensions. He is also one of the originators of the idea of Minimal Flavor Violation, a paradigm to characterize the effects of flavor transitions in new theories of particle physics. After the discovery of the Higgs boson, he computed the probability that the Higgs vacuum undergoes quantum tunnelling, finding the surprising result that the universe is in a critical state which will eventually end in a cosmic collapse. Support of particle accelerator projects Giudice has played an active role in studying the physics potential of particle accelerators, supporting and advocating several new projects at CERN and in other laboratories worldwide. He has coordinated study groups for LEP, Tevatron, the Neutrino Factory, LHC, CLIC, CLIC Conceptual Design Report (2012) . SuperB and has participated in the committee reviewing the safety of collisions at the LHC. He is a member of the LHC Experiments Committee (LHCC), the body that reviews the activity of the experimental groups at the LHC, and of the European Committee for Future Accelerators (ECFA), the advisory body for long-range planning of high-energy facilities in Europe. Science popularization Besides his research work, Giudice is active in popularization of science and outreach, often giving public lectures on particle physics and related topics, and participating in science festivals and other events.

Biography  Didier Rimaud was the grandson of Emile Rimaud . Although born in Carnac which was the holiday home of his family, Didier Rimaud grew up and studied in Lyon. His large family (8 children) and his parents were amateur musicians. He became a Jesuit in 1941 after a year of novitiate, then began to sing in the Little Singers of Provence choir. With the National Center for Pastoral Liturgy (NDC) he began in the 1950s to participate in writing French texts of the Catholic liturgy and providing guidance for the redevelopment of places of worship . According to Rimaud, the anonymous translation of liturgical texts, as difficult as it was (requiring him to collect and reconcile the observations of many bishops), gave him great joy when he heard these texts used in worship. In 1952, he published his first liturgical chant, side E 20 : Lord, come. In the 1970s, after the Second Vatican Council, the Society of Jesus reminded its members not to dissociate the proclamation of the faith and the pursuit of social justice for the poor. This marked Didier Rimaud and greatly influenced his later compositions. With Vatican II Rimaud felt the need to expand the repertoire of French songs for the liturgy. He collaborated with musicians such as Jacques Berthier, Jo Akepsimas Joseph Gelineau and Christian Villeneuve. He also participated in the liturgical translation of the Bible into French. This translation is intended to be understood by listeners orally at a celebration. The original draft was made in 1970 for passages read during the celebrations, and a draft was completed in the 2000s for the whole of the Old Testament.

Louis Riel lived along with them from his return to Red River in 1868, through the Red River Resistance, until his exile in 1870. It is also where his body lay in state for two days in December 1885 after his sentencing and execution for murder and treason, before being buried in St. Boniface. The house remained within the possession of Riel descendants until 1968, when it was acquired by the Winnipeg Historical Society. The house was restored to its 1886 condition, and converted into a museum. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1976 and a Federal Heritage Building in 2000. It is owned and administered by Parks Canada, but since 2013 the Louis Riel Institute (an associate of the Manitoba M√©tis Federation) has provided interpretation and programming.

Life Sotiriou was born in Aydin, in western Anatolia and at that time part of the Ottoman Empire, as the daughter of Evangelos Pappas and Marianthi Papadopoulou, in a wealthy and polyglot bourgeois R√ªm family who lived in a stately home. Her childhood, Sotiriou said, appeared to her as an \\"endless fairy tale\\". She had two older and two younger siblings. After her father, an entrepreneur, went bankrupt and her family became poor, Dido, who at that time was about eight years old, was sent to her wealthy uncle and his wife in Athens, where later she was educated. Sotiriou later described this separation from her family as \\"my first experience as a refugee\\".Sotiriou, \\"Geschichte einer Frau\\", p. 581 In 1919 the family moved to Smyrna (now Izmir), at that time occupied by Greece, but in 1922 Turkey repulsed the Greek invasion of Asia Minor (Greek-Turkish War), and Sotiriou's family had to leave Smyrna because of the Greek-Turkish population exchange. The family landed in the port of Piraeus, where the father worked in the docks and on ships as a clerk. In Athens, she was raised in her aunt's house in the affluent, middle-class milieu. There she completed her studies, attending the French Institute and having as teachers Kostas Paroritis and Sophia Mavroeidis-Papadakis, and later attending the Sorbonne. However, as she herself explained, she developed in that period a strong sense of social justice, especially because of the contrast between her own privileged situation and the humble way of living of her parents and siblings.Sotiriou, \\"Geschichte einer Frau\\", p. 582 She became a member of the union and so came to the leftist movement. In 1933 she joined the anti-fascist front. In 1935 she met in Geneva Vladimir Lenin‚Äôs comrade Alexandra Kollontai and in 1945 she was cofounder of the Women‚Äôs International Democratic Federation in Paris. In 1936 she began her career as a journalist. She fought against the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas and later, in the period of Axis occupation, she joined the Communist Party of Greece and worked for an underground anti-fascist newspaper. Sotiriou declared in a 1989 interview that since the beginning of her political engagement in 1932 she always stood \\"on the left wing\\". She was proud of having waived both her inheritance and the patrimony of her aunt, having the goal of being free and being able to do what she wanted.Sotiriou, \\"Geschichte einer Frau\\", p. 583 Traveling to Paris, she met writers as Andr√© Malraux, Andr√© Gide and Louis Aragon. In the 1950s she herself began to write novels, \\"to tell the truth.\\" The protagonists of \\"Farewell Anatolia\\" live in a little Greek Village near Ephesus, like ≈ûirince (pictured). In 1959 she published her first novel, The Dead Await (\\"ŒüŒπ ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒØ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ\\"). In 1962 appeared Bloody Earth (\\"ŒúŒ±œÑœâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ± ŒßœéŒºŒ±œÑŒ±\\"; title of the English edition: \\"Farewell Anatolia\\"), probably her greatest success. The book deals with the trauma of the Greek-Turkish population exchange and the expulsion of Greeks from Asia Minor. In the preface Sotiriou mentions that she wrote the novel on the basis of the memories of a little Asia Minor farmer named Axiotis Manolis, who had lived the events as an eyewitness. From his perspective, the book is written in first person. The book was (and still is) also very popular in Turkey, probably because, as the author said, \\"there are no evil Greek and Turk, but only people who are victims and pay dear for it\\". The book has been reprinted sixty-five times in Greece and translated into six languages, including Turkish in 1970 and French in 1996. Subject of a novel published in 1976, Commandment (\\"ŒïŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒÆ\\"), is the time of the Greek Civil War and the secret machinations against the Greek democracy. Depicted therein is the fate of Nikos Beloyannis, a Communist resistance fighter who was executed in 1952. Another work is Katedafizometha (\\"Shattered\\"), appeared in 1982. Sotiriou was chief editor of a women's magazine, Gynaika (\\"Woman\\"), and foreign policy commentator on various newspapers, as Neos Kosmos (\\"New World\\") and the Greek Communist Party's daily Rizospastis, where she became editor-in-chief from 1944. As a novelist, she received many awards. In 1986, she was with Zulfu Livaneli and Mikis Theodorakis among the founders of the Association for the Turkish-Greek Friendship (Daphne/Defne). She died in Athens at the age of 95 years because of pneumonia. The Dido Sotiriou Cultural Prize, issued by the Hellenic Authors' Society, is named after her. Dido Sotiriou is a realistic writer who uses self biographical elements participating emotionally to the adventures of her protagonists. Her novels deal with the Asia Minor Catastrophe, the civil war period and the post-war period in Greece. Works Prose *The dead are waiting.

Along with Auguste Denayrouze, Rouquayrol invented a diving suit and breathing apparatus.  Biography  Beno√Æt Rouquayrol was born on June 13, 1826, at Espalion, in the Aveyron department of Southern France. He became an engineer at the Saint- √âtienne School of Mines. He became employed at a company involved in bituminous coal mining and foundries in Aveyron, and became the director of accounting by 1865. In 1860, Rouquayrol became concerned with mine safety problems related to firedamp (flammable natural gases in coal mines). He created a rescue apparatus consisting of a pressurized gas chamber coupled to a pressure regulator that he called the \\"Regulator for Equalization of Compressed Gas\\". In 1864, with the help of the French Navy lieutenant Auguste Denayrouze (also of Aveyron), Rouquayrol created the first diving suit. This diving suit won the gold medal at the 1867 World's Fair, and drew the attention of the author Jules Verne. Verne included the diving suit in his fictional depiction of a contemporary submarine voyage, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Rouquayrol died on November 14, 1875, at Rodez, Aveyron, France.  Chronology of patents and inventions  * April 14, 1860: Rouquayrol disclosed a patent for a regulator designed for a rescue-apparatus for miners who were victims of firedamp or asphyxiation * January 16, 1862: Rouquayrol disclosed a patent for the \\"Rouquayrol Isolator\\" composed of a regulator with a diving mask fitted over the nose and mouth, using a vulcanized rubber seal affixed inside a metallic beak. This system eliminated the need for a heavy metallic diving helmet. * August 25, 1863: a patent for a \\"hydraulic joint\\" pressurizing pump, in which the pistons were fixed and the body of the pump moved. Additionally, Rouquayrol contributed to related inventions in co- operation with Auguste Denayrouze and others.

The dedication is to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary but it is also popularly known as Santa Maria della Vittoria from the statue of the Madonna kept here. It is the seat of the Bishop of Lucera-Troia (previously of the Bishops of Lucera), and is also a minor basilica. In its present form it originates mostly from the 14th century. It is one of the very few buildings in Apulia in which the Gothic architectural style of the medieval French rulers appears almost unaltered.Willemsen: Apulien, p. 41  Site and dedication  The church is located in the historical town centre of Lucera, on the Piazza del Duomo. The dedication, to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, refers to a small gilded wooden statue of the Virgin of the late 14th century, which has the nickname Madonna della vittoria (\\"Madonna of Victory\\"), because it is said to commemorate the victory of the Anjou dynasty over the Hohenstaufen in Southern Italy.Rotter: Apulien, p. 96  Foundation and construction history  The present church stands on the site of an older one, that in the time of Emperor Frederick II was turned into a mosque for the use of the Saracens from Sicily who had been resettled in the nearby Lucera Castle and retained their Islamic belief, from whom Frederick formed his bodyguard. After the massacre or enslavement of most of the Saracens in 1300 under Charles II of Naples the mosque was destroyed. Charles ordered a new church (the present cathedral) to be built on the site, probably under the supervision of the master builder Pierre d'Agincourt. Construction was completed by 1317. In the 16th and 17th centuries the church interior was refurbished according to the taste of the Baroque. In the 19th century these alterations were to some extent undone. Pope Gregory XVI elevated the church to the rank of a basilica minor in 1834.  West front  The asymmetrical west front is in three parts. The left and central parts date from the 14th century. Both are very plain. Above the side portal on the left the wall is broken only by a simple window with a pointed arch, while in the centre over the main portal is a single round window, which - unusually for an important Apulian church - has not been elaborated into a rose window. The right-hand part of the west front, constructed later, is formed by a tower of generally Romanesque appearance, even though it is more recent than the Gothic portions .Rotter: Apulien, p. 95 The octagonal cupola is of the 16th century. Despite the overall simplicity of the west front, the figure carvings on the portals are well-executed in their detail.  Interior and furnishings  Altar The cathedral interior is that of a basilica heavily influenced by the style of French Gothic cathedrals, as exemplified by the three aisles set in a church of cruciform groundplan. French influence is clearly seen in the arcades of pointed arches of the wide central aisle and the pillars which support them. The half-columns in front of them are of considerably greater age.Rotter: Apulien, p. 95 The high walls of the nave are pierced only by very small lancet windows. The transept is of notable depth, while the choir also has lancet windows. The east end of the cathedral terminates in three apses. The statue of the Madonna della Vittoria is on the altar in the left arm of the transept. The 15th-century frescoes in the left-hand apse are of particular note, while the right-hand apse contains a crucifix from the Rhineland of about 1340 as well as the gravestone of a French knight, also from the 14th century. The pulpit dates from 1560. The stone table, supported by octagonal columns with various capitals, which now forms the high altar is of particular historical interest in that it was originally a table in Castel Fiorentino, where Emperor Frederick II died in 1250.Rotter, Apulien, p. 96 References  Sources  * Braunfels, Wolfgang (1984): Kleine italienische Kunstgeschichte.

It affects growth regulation and starvation response.  Modifications  Ras2 becomes post-translationally modified in two ways, both being necessary for its activity: Upon activation, palmitoylation at its C terminus takes place and causes attachment from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Farnesylation allows for efficient interaction with the downstream adenylate cyclase Cyr1p. In wild-type yeast deactivated Ras2 is transported to and degraded in the vacuole, a process for which Whi2 is essential. Disturbing this process leads to Ras2 accumulation at the mitochondrial membrane, a behavior that was not observed before.  Ras2-cAMP-PKA pathway  When activating the adenylate cyclase, Ras2 indirectly raises the cellular cAMP levels, thereby activating the PKA, by which in turn it is downregulated.  Downstream effects  In a probably indirect manner via the above PKA regulation, Ras2 has a suppressing effect on the yeast general stress response transcription factor Msn2. Active Ras2 was also found in the nucleus, the reason is currently unknown.

When the young man begs for a second chance he is answered with a string of reasons, drawing on West Asian folklore, why this would be useless. Among them is the accusation that 'Thou hast been to me like the tree that said to its woodcutters, \\"If something of me were not in your hands, ye had not fallen upon me‚Äù.'The Story of Ahikar, London 1898, p.82 This refers to the fact that the axes of the woodmen have wooden shafts and the trees have therefore contributed to their own doom. A number of proverbs derive from the story, with the general meaning of being to blame for one's own misfortune. They include the Hebrew 'the axe goes to the wood from whence it borrowed its helve,John Ray, A Compleat Collection of English Proverbs, 4th edition London 1768 p.309 of which there are KannadaUb Narasinga Rao A Handbook of Kannada Proverbs, Madras 1912, p.24 and UrduEnglish-Urdu dictionary equivalents, and the Turkish ‚ÄòWhen the axe came into the Forest, the trees said \\"The handle is one of us\\".'George K.Danns, Domination and Power in Guyana, University of New Brunswick NJ 1982, p.1 Wenceslas Hollar's engraving of the woodcutter, included in John Ogilby's collection of Aesop's Fables, 1664 In the Greek cultural area, which at one time included all of West Asia, there were three fables dealing with the relations between trees and woodcutters. In one of these, numbered 302 in the Perry Index,Aesopica site the oaks complain about their treatment to Zeus, the king of the gods, who answers that they have only themselves to blame for supplying the wood for their axe staves. A different fable of similar meaning is The Eagle Wounded by an Arrow, numbered 276 in the Perry Index. In it an Eagle complains of being wounded by an arrow vaned with its own feathers. Commentaries on these fables point out that suffering is increased by the knowledge that it is one's own fault.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable : Volume I. Introduction and from the Origins to the Hellenistic Age, Brill 1999, p.184 Trust betrayed In another variant of the theme, a woodman comes into the forest and begs the trees 'to give him a handle made of the hardest wood. The other trees selected the wood of the wild olive. The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. Then, without a moment's hesitation, he began to chop down the trees' mighty branches and trunks, taking whatever he wanted. The oak tree then said to the ash, 'It serves us right, since we gave our enemy the handle he asked for!' This text comes from the Mediaeval Latin fable collection of Ademar of Chabannes, who comments upon it, 'You should think twice before offering anything to your enemies' (Ut cogites ante ne hosti aliqua praestes).Fable 44 This version was taken up early by the Anglo-French poet Marie de FranceThe fables of Marie de France: an English translation, Birmingham AL 1988, p.143] and was also preferred by 15th century collectors of fables in European vernaculars like Heinrich Steinhowel and William Caxton. During Renaissance times it was made the subject of poems by the German Neo-Latinists Hieronymus Osiuspoem 40 and Pantaleon Candidus.poem 147 Jean de la Fontaine also made it the subject of his La for√™t et le b√ªcheron (Fables X11.16), translated by Elizur Wright as \\"The Woods and the Woodman\\".100 Fables of La Fontaine p.168, available at Gutenberg In his telling, the woodman breaks his promise to work further off and not harm his benefactors. A version based on this was set for accompanied children's voices by the composer Rudolf Schmidt-Wunstorf (b. 1916). This final fable was retold by Rabindranath Tagore in a six-line poem included in his Bengali collection Kanika (1899). Later, he condensed it as Poem 71 in his English-language collection Stray Birds (1916): :The woodcutter's axe begged for its handle from the tree. ::The tree gave it.William Radice, Poetry and Community, New Delhi 2003, p.221 In the Bengali collection, the poem was titled \\"Politics\\", and with this clue the reader was expected to interpret the fable in the context of the time as a parable of the imperial stripping of Indian resources.Peter Linebaugh, The Magna Carta Manifesto: Liberties and Commons for All, University of California 2008, p.146ff References External links Illustrations from books dating from the 15th-20th centuries Woodcutter and the Trees Woodcutter and the Trees Woodcutter and the Trees ","title":"The Woodcutter and the Trees"},{"id":"34278544","text":"Kaveh-ye Vosta (, also Romanized as KƒÅveh-ye Vos≈£√°; and Deh-e Vos≈£√°) is a village in Kakavand-e Sharqi Rural District, Kakavand District, Delfan County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

It was initially proposed by its authors as a building block in various protocols and applications, as well as to discourage the proliferation of multiple KDF mechanisms. The main approach HKDF follows is the \\"extract-then-expand\\" paradigm, where the KDF logically consists of two modules: the first stage takes the input keying material and \\"extracts\\" from it a fixed-length pseudorandom key, and then the second stage \\"expands\\" this key into several additional pseudorandom keys (the output of the KDF). It can be used, for example, to convert shared secrets exchanged via Diffie‚ÄìHellman into key material suitable for use in encryption, integrity checking or authentication. It is formally described in the RFC 5869. One of its authors also described the algorithm in a companion paper in 2010. In November, 2011, NIST released SP 800-56C, superseded in April, 2018 by SP 800-56C Rev. 1. Both state that HKDF's specification is a conforming scheme and point to its paper for the rationale for the recommendations' extract-and-expand mechanisms. There are implementations of HKDF for C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and other languages. Mechanism HKDF extracts a pseudorandom key (PRK) using an HMAC hash function (e.g. HMAC-SHA256) on an optional salt (acting as a key) and any potentially weak input key material (IKM) (acting as data). It then generates similarly cryptographically strong output key material (OKM) of any desired length by repeatedly generating PRK-keyed hash- blocks and then appending them into the output key material, finally truncating to the desired length. For added security, the PRK-keyed HMAC- hashed blocks are chained during their generation by prepending the previous hash block to an incrementing 8-bit counter with an optional context string in the middle before being hashed by HMAC to generate the current hash block. Note: HKDF does not amplify entropy but does allow a large source of weaker entropy to be utilised more evenly and effectively. Uses HKDF has two primary and potentially independent uses: 1\\\\. To \\"extract\\" (condense/blend) entropy from a larger random source to provide a more uniformly unbiased and higher entropy but smaller output (e.g., an encryption key). This is done by utilising the diffusion properties of cryptographic MACs. 2\\\\. To \\"expand\\" the generated output of an already reasonably random input such as an existing shared key into a larger cryptographically independent output, thereby producing multiple keys deterministically from that initial shared key, so that the same process may produce those same secret keys safely on multiple devices, as long as the same inputs are utilised. These two functions may also be combined and used to form a PRNG to improve a random number generator's potentially-biased output, as well as to protect it from analysis and help defend the random number generation from malicious inputs.  Example: Python implementation  #!/usr/bin/env python3 import hashlib import hmac from math import ceil hash_len = 32 def hmac_sha256(key, data): return hmac.new(key, data, hashlib.sha256).digest() def hkdf(length: int, ikm, salt: bytes = b\\"\\", info: bytes = b\\"\\") -> bytes: if len(salt)  0: salt = bytes([0] * hash_len) prk = hmac_sha256(salt, ikm) t = b\\"\\" okm = b\\"\\" for i in range(ceil(length / hash_len)): t = hmac_sha256(prk, t + info + bytes([1 + i])) okm += t return okm[:length]  References   External links  * RFC 5869: HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) Cryptography Key derivation functions ","title":"HKDF"},{"id":"34278671","text":"Not to be confused with Emile Malo-Renault or Nori Malo-Renault.

Billeaux in 1957 left of the road, just before the junction. A further Acheulean site was found downhill to the southwest by Henri Fleisch. The site was extended by further discoveries by M. Le Cavalier and F. and L. Skeels at Jeb Farah. The area is notable for draining mountain waters into the most northerly feeders of the Jordan river. The Acheulean material was published by Fleisch in 1966 with the Neolithic remains studied by Jacques Cauvin. Over three hundred Acheulean bifaces were collected along with various waste, used cores and rough-outs. It was mostly in brown, shiny flint, some with a grey film. The pieces were heavily patinated, sometimes with a number of different patinas. This allowed Fleisch to divide the tools into four groups, Early Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic, Middle/Late Paleolithic, and Upper Paleolithic with Levallois technique being used on cores in later periods. The Heavy Neolithic and Neolithic material was mostly in a creamy chert and consisted of adzes, chisels, oval axes with retouch all over, racloirs, cores and discs. Lorraine Copeland made a collection of similar materials in 1966 and noted the problems assigning material to specific periods.

He was born at Quimper, in Brittany 26 March 1735 and died at Paris 1 May 1794. He was one of the deputies from the Paris clergy to the Estates-General of 1789. Biography B√©rardier was raised by his grandfather Pierre Bousquet, who had been the founder of the Quimper pottery in 1708. He attended the Jesuit college at Quimper, sand then the Sorbonne, where he obtained a doctorate in theology. After the expulsion of the Jesuits from France in 1762, he was appointed Principal of the college at Quimper. He was interested in physics, conducting researches into electricity and founding a physics class at the college. B√©rardier was not on good terms with Toussaint Francois Joseph Conen of St. Luke, the new Bishop of Cornouaille, whose seat was in Quimper and who asserted jurisdiction over the college. He therefore obtained a transfer in 1778 to the extremely prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, also formerly run by the Jesuits; he also was one of the syndics of the Paris Faculty of Theology. Among his students were Camille Desmoulins and Maximilien Robespierre, Political career In 1789, when King Louis XVI was forced to summon the Estates-General, he was elected as one of the representatives of the Paris clergy to the Second Estate. When the Etats- General were reconstituted as the National Assembly and then the National Constituent Assembly. he took his place with the conservative element, seated on the right side of the assembly. He, along with many of the French clergy, opposed the revolutionary Civil Constitution of the Clergy that formalized the nationalization of church property and dissolved the remaining monastic establishments.

Biography  The son of a grocer, Allier went to Paris to study law, and earned a license to practice which did not however dissuade him from complaining about the 'decaying morals' that he felt were rampant in the capital. He went back to the provinces to settle in Bourbon-l'Archambault. Victor Hugo, next to the Orleans royal family, encouraged Achille Allier to contribute with the renewal of the French provinces' interest. Both saw on it an opportunity to oppose the fragmentation of the French departments, and to contest the Jacobinism. Allier was responsible for the restoration of the chapel of the church at Bourbon. He was also the illustrator, designer and founder-director of the monthly magazine Art en Province (Art in the provinces), founded by him in 1835.The magazine's publication kept alive until 15 years after his death. Allier died in 1836 from a stroke. Honors A plaque was fixed at his birthplace in Montlu√ßon, 18 rue Notre-Dame. In Bourbon-l'Archambault, a street is also named after him, and a bust by the sculptor Auguste Pr√©ault was erected in his memory in the town's churchyard in time for a memorial service held on 15 September 1836.

He was the most significant figure of the French Neo-Malthusianism movement. Paul Robin was born in Toulon into a bourgeois, Catholic and patriotic family. A pupil of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in Paris, he passed his bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physical sciences; he becomes a Darwinist and an atheist. He was briefly a high school teacher (1861 - 1865), but came into conflict with his administration on matters of popular education, for which he had a keen interest. In 1865, he left for Belgium where he established contacts with activists of the International Workers' Association, helped create the Belgian section of the AIT and was expelled for having participated in the movement supporting a strike. He retired to Switzerland, then to France (where he was imprisoned in July 1870), and finally to England. In London, where he frequented the militants of the International; he was a member of the General Council of the International for a time, but quickly broke with the ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù and Marx to take the side of Mikhail Bakunin, whose anarchist ideas he shared. During his voluntary exile, he gave lessons. In 1879, he returned to France as an inspector of primary education appointed by Ferdinand Buisson, director of primary education to Minister Jules Ferry. Robin had previously collaborated on the Ferdinand Buisson Dictionary of Pedagogy. Thanks to Buisson, who gave him constant support, Robin was placed at the head, from 1880 to 1894, of the Pr√©vost Orphanage, in Cempuis (Oise). In this establishment which depends on the general council of the Seine, he put into practice, on a significant number of children, the theories on integral education which he formulated from 1869 to 1870. This education, which is intended to give children from disadvantaged classes the means to access education, is characterized, in addition to its atheism and internationalism, by the concern to harmoniously develop the individual as a whole. Robin's teaching was based upon observation, development of the artistic direction of the child and taking into account the children's desires. Co-education was the rule, and the children were taken along for two months to the sea each summer, etc. Physical, manual and intellectual education were complemented with 19 different workshops which provided them at least one complete formation of a trade occupation (a bakery, printing works, photography, masonry, etc.). These workshops also provided the school a certain financial autonomy. Robin's educational methods, too revolutionary for their time, resulted in his expulsion from Cempuis on August 31, 1894, following a very virulent press campaign waged against him by the Free Word. Octave Mirbeau then took up his defense and denounced the liberticide collusion between Cartouche (the corrupt republican politicians) and Loyola (the retrograde Catholic Church). In 1896, Robin founded the League for Human Regeneration. At its head, he introduced into France the neo-Malthusian principles he had discovered in England and tirelessly campaigned to disseminate the means of birth control among the working class. He saw ‚Äúparental caution‚Äù as a means of emancipation for the poorest and particularly women. He also developed certain eugenic aspects - a theory which was widespread at the time in medical circles. He published numerous neo-Malthusian propaganda brochures. He worked for a time with Eugene Humbert, with whom he eventually had a falling-out. Feeling his strength and his faculties decline, Paul Robin took his own life in 1912. Positivist to the end, he studied the progress of the effect of the poison on himself. But Robin's legacy at Cempuis was not lost, and he had a tremendous influence on two other great anarchist pedagogues: Francisco Ferrer and S√©bastien Faure.

H. Dancourt. He was born Louis Heurteaux (also spelled Hurtaut) and adopted Dancourt as a pseudonym. The latter name is also sometimes given as d'Ancourt. (1725 - 29 July 1801) was a French librettist, dramatist, and actor.Couvreur 2001. Career He was born Louis Heurteaux in Paris, and later adopted Dancourt as a pseudonym.Couvreur 2001; Louis Heurteaux dit Dancourt at c√©sar (French). He was unsuccessful in Paris as an actor and appeared in the French provinces in Rennes, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, and Rouen, as well as outside France in Bayreuth, Munich, Berlin, and Brussels. In Berlin after 1755, he wrote the libretto of Le triple horoscope, a divertissement with music composed by Gaultier. In 1762, with a favorable recommendation from Charles Simon Favart, he joined the French company performing in Vienna. His libretto for La rencontre impr√©vue, ou Les p√®lerins de la Mecque (1763), a three-act op√©ra- comique, was set to music by Christoph Willibald Gluck and first performed on 7 January 1764 in Vienna. Dancourt was able to mount revivals in Brussels in 1765, Bordeaux (as Ali et Rezia) in 1766, and Paris (as Les fous de M√©dine, ou La rencontre impr√©vue, with music arranged by Jean-Pierre Soli√©) in 1790. It was adapted and translated into Italian by Carl Friberth and inspired Haydn's L'incontro improvviso (1775). In addition to his career as an actor and librettist, Dancourt authored a rebuttal to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles. Rousseau had argued against the city of Geneva building a theater, arguing that it would corrupt their egalitarian republican principles. He had also argued against women appearing in public and had attacked their virtue. In Dancourt's response, Dancourt, Arlequin de Berlin √† M. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, he defends the morality of the theater as well as the virtue and intellectual capacity of women, and he makes a vigorous argument in favor of women's education.

It is intended to be coupled with external numerical software such as computer-aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEM), structural analysis and computational fluid dynamics tools. It was developed by Cyber Dyne Srl and provides both a design environment for problem definition and analysis and a software network infrastructure to distribute the computational load.  History  Cyber Dyne was founded in 2011 as a research startup to transfer the knowledge of its founders in the field of numerical optimization and computational intelligence methods into a commercial product.  Features  The problem definition workflow is based on the data flow paradigm. Multiple nodes can be interconnected to describe the data flow from the design variables to the desired objectives and constraints. Input/output nodes can be used to calculate any part of the objective(s) computation, using internal (Java, Python or Bash/Batch) or external (third-party) processes. Any of these procedures can be distributed over a LAN or the Cloud, exploiting all the available computational resources. The optimization core is open, and using the memetic computing (MC) approach, which is an extension of the concept of memetic algorithm, the user can define its own optimization algorithm as a set of independent pieces of code called \\"operators\\", or \\"memes\\". Operators can be implemented either in Java or Python. Algorithm design In mathematical folklore, the no free lunch theorem (sometimes pluralized) of David Wolpert and William G. Macready appears in the 1997 \\"No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization.\\"Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1997), \\"No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization,\\" IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation 1, 67. http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf This mathematical result states the need for a specific effort in the design of a new algorithm, tailored to the specific problem to be optimized. Kimeme allows the design and experimentation of new optimization algorithms through the new paradigm of memetic computing, a subject of computational intelligence which studies algorithmic structures composed of multiple interacting and evolving modules (memes)Neri, F. & Cotta, C. 2011. \\"A primer on memetic algorithms\\".

Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube are available for robustness analysis. Sensitivity analysis Local sensitivity as correlation coefficients and partial derivatives can be used only if the correlation between input and output is linear. If the correlation is nonlinear, the global sensitivity analysis has to be used based on a variance-relationship between input and output distribution, such as the Sobol index. With sensitivity analysis, the system complexity can be reduced and the cause- effect chain can be explained.Saltelli, A., Chan, K. and Scott, E.M.: Sensitivity Analysis.

Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 66:751-769, 2004 Multi-objective optimization In the development process of technical products, there are usually several evaluation goals or criteria to be met, e.g. low cost, high quality, low noise etc. These criteria often conflict with each other, in the sense that the minimization of one entails the maximization of at least another one. Design parameters have to be found in order to find the best trade-off among multiple criteria. Unlike the single-objective case, in multi-objective optimization there is not a unique solution, but rather a front of Pareto optimal solutions. Multi-objective optimization aims at finding the Pareto optimal solutions automatically.

The rugby team currently plays in Primera Divisi√≥n B, the second division of the URBA league system, while the hockey team competes at tournaments organised by the Buenos Aires Hockey Association.

The World War I brought with it the import of hurleys was interrupted, as a result, the practise of hurling ceased until the war came to an end. In 1920, several clubs such as Buenos Aires, Mercedes, Wanderers and Bearna Baoghail, met to find a field where to play hurling. As none of the clubs had an own field, the first games were played at Club Singer.El hurling en Argentina In August 1922, the Banco de la Naci√≥n Argentina rented a land in the Floresta district to BA Hurling Club. On August 22, the \\"Federaci√≥n Argentina de Hurling\\" (Argentine Hurling Federation) was officially established. Nevertheless, in 1924 the Municipality of Buenos Aires sent an eviction order to the club, alleging that new streets would be opened there. Hurling moved to Villa Devoto, where the club rented a land on Santo Tom√© streets. During its years in Villa Devoto, the club formed the first women's field hockey team (which began to compete under the \\"Golden Wings\\" name in 1931) and hosted the practise of athletics, bowls and tennis.Primer predio de Hurling As the practise of hurling decreased (due to problems to import the hurleys), some of Hurling's members began to introduce other sports to the club, such as men's field hockey and rugby union, which first practises were in 1941 but the first match was played one year later. The jersey chosen was green, white and orange in horizontal strips, that would be worn until 1956. The first URBA team that played Hurling was Lomas Athletic in May 1942. The game was played in Villa Devoto, with Lomas winning by 19‚Äì5. The line-up was: K. Patricio Keegan, Guillermo MacAllister, A. Harten, Santiago Ussher (captain) , Lorenzo Shanly, Desmond Fitzpatrick, Tom√°s Mac Cormack, Edmundo Shanly, J.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1981 through Posh Boy Records. Its fast tempos and politically radical lyrics established the band as a major force in the southern California hardcore scene of the time. T.S.O.L. quickly moved away from leftist political subject matter, however, shifting in a gothic rock direction and changing labels to Frontier Records for their full- length album Dance with Me (1981). This led to a dispute with Posh Boy owner Robbie Fields, who claimed the band owed his label another EP. The two parties eventually reached a settlement in which Posh Boy gained the rights to T.S.O.L.'s 1982 EP Weathered Statues, combining it with the debut EP in the 1987 compilation album Thoughts of Yesterday: 1981‚Äì1982. Nitro Records purchased the master recordings from Posh Boy in 1997 and re-released the two EPs as the compilation T.S.O.L. / Weathered Statues. Recording and release Having made a name for themselves with their live shows, T.S.O.L. received an offer from Posh Boy Records owner Robbie Fields to make a record. According to singer Jack Grisham, the arrangement was based mostly on a verbal agreement which the band expected Fields would exploit: > It was shit money and a shit deal, but what did we care? The initial > contract got flushed down the toilet at Sammy Wong's hotel when we were > playing a gig in San Francisco, and we didn't even bother to sign a new one. > We made a verbal agreement with the Fagin of punk rock. Robbie, or the \\"Posh > One\\", was an ex-Brit, a sometimes substitute teacher who minored in punk > rock exploitation. He was the perfect host for our first disc. Robbie had > his own record company, Posh Boy Records. Jesus, even the name sounded like > a scam. The band had already written most of the songs that would comprise their debut album, Dance with Me (1981), but were distrustful of Fields and chose to only give him a few tracks: \\"We knew Posh Boy was gonna burn us,\\" said Grisham, \\"but we wanted to put out a record. So it was like 'Let's give him these [songs], and we'll save the good stuff for later. The EP was recorded in March 1981 at Brian Elliot Recording in North Hollywood, Los Angeles with Fields and recording engineer David Hines. Hines mixed the tracks, and they were mastered by Stan Ross at Los Angeles' Gold Star Studios. The cover artwork consists of a high-contrast solarised print of a live photograph of the band taken by Edward Colver.Blush, p. 91. \\"The Posh One went way out of pocket on this one,\\" said Grisham. \\"He spent five hundred dollars making that disc, and the quality showed. You can even hear the sound of an uninvited motorcycle going by on the highway during one of the songs. It didn't matter, though; it was the feeling in the music and the lyrics that counted.\\"Grisham, p. 195. T.S.O.L. was released in 1981 through Posh Boy as catalog number PBS 1013.Blush, p. 326. Grisham credited himself as Jack Greggors on the sleeve, beginning a tradition of using a different pseudonym on each release both to confuse audiences and to hide his true identity from the police.Grisham, p. 196.Blush, p. 94. Drummer Todd Barnes credited himself as Francis Gerald Barnes. Music and lyrics The songs on T.S.O.L. are fast-tempoed and have angry, leftist lyrics attacking the United States government and the renewal of the military draft. Grisham has described it as \\"four kids hating the government and refusing to get real jobs. It was muscular and threatening, anarchistic and confrontational. It was a straight up attack at the government of the United States and those involved with it.\\" \\"Property Is Theft\\" employs Marxist rhetoric, echoing the communist belief in the abolishment of private property, while \\"Abolish Government / Silent Majority\\" is anarchist in nature. Reflecting on the EP thirty years later, Grisham recalled that the band already had most of the songs' lyrics written before he joined, and that he probably only penned those to \\"No Way Out\\". He criticized the lyrics' naivety, since the band members were too young to pay taxes or be drafted, and pointed out the lack of focus in \\"Superficial Love\\": \\"Superficial love, only for a fuck / But love is incest, and it's only for a buck / Eating to survive, surviving for free / Peacetime, wartime, trying to draft me...It's like, 'What the hell? Are you talking about this, or are you talking about that? What are you talking about?' When you break it down, it doesn't make much sense.\\" Grisham sings in a faux-British accent inspired by John Lydon of the Sex Pistols. \\"On those first recordings, I sounded like I was from Long Beach via England,\\" he later reflected.Grisham, p. 190. \\"It was hard to listen to, but I mimicked the bands I loved; Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, and The Damned were all English bands. There were some very cool American bands I also adored, but something about a British accent made punk rock what it was.\\" The band soon moved away from ultra-political subject matter, shifting in a gothic rock direction for their full-length album Dance with Me, released later that year through Frontier Records. \\"People talk about how T.S.O.L. changed so much from the first EP to Dance with Me\\", recalled Grisham, \\"from political punk to gothic punk. But we had all those songs before we did the first EP. If you look on the first EP cover, my hair's sticking straight up, I'm wearing some Frankenstein suit, and I've got black makeup all over my eyes.\\" Reception and legacy The EP's emotional sound and vicious attitude ensured T.S.O.L.'s standing as a major force in the southern California hardcore scene. According to Grisham, \\"the kids ate it up like candy, or cheap booze, and the shows grew in size.\\" Steven Blush, author of American Hardcore: A Tribal History, writes that it was \\"lauded for its political conviction\\". In a retrospective review for Allmusic, Alex Henderson rated it four stars out of five. He remarked that the political stances of \\"Property Is Theft\\" and \\"Abolish Government / Silent Majority\\" seem opposing, representing two radically different schools of thought and making it unclear which ideology the band preferred. \\"What is clear\\", he said, \\"is that this record hits its mark musically even though its lyrics can be nebulous. Whatever you think of T.S.O.L.'s politics, this EP is an inspired and exhilarating slice of early '80s punk.\\" Adam Bregman, reviewing Dance with Me, called the debut EP \\"exceptional\\". Re-releases Following the EP's release, T.S.O.L. signed to Frontier Records for their full-length album Dance with Me. This caused a dispute with Posh Boy, who claimed the band had not honored their commitment to record a second EP for the label. Several years later, Posh Boy and the four original members of T.S.O.L. (Grisham and Barnes had left the band in 1983) worked out a settlement in which the band received back payments of royalties from the label, and Posh Boy purchased the master recordings and publishing rights to T.S.O.L.'s 1982 EP Weathered Statues, originally released through Alternative Tentacles. Posh Boy combined the two EPs to make the 1987 compilation album Thoughts of Yesterday: 1981‚Äì1982 (later re-released through Rhino Records). Nitro Records purchased the master tapes from Posh Boy in 1997, remastered them, and re-released the two EPs as the compilation T.S.O.L. / Weathered Statues. Of the Nitro release, Allmusic's Steve Huey remarked that it \\"showcases the group's pulverizing early sound\\".

The size of the stones suggested that they were the foundations of a stone fortalice. There is also a diary record of the blowing up of the castle at Newtyle.

History The station began broadcasting online in July 2010 as Network North Devon, part of a group of internet radio stations owned by former Lantern FM presenter Ian Starling. The station was set up in response to Global Radio's decision to merge five of its Heart radio stations (in North Devon, Plymouth & the surrounding areas, the Exeter & Torbay areas and the South Hams) into one county-wide station based in Exeter. By this time, local programming on the Heart stations had been restricted to breakfast and drivetime slots. The Voice was granted its first licence to broadcast on FM for 28 days from 9 November 2010 to 6 December 2010 under a Restricted Service Licence by Ofcom, serving the Barnstaple area on 106 FM and online via the station's website. Further RSL broadcasts have since been made on FM for the Barnstaple and Bideford areas. While the station was off air between its various FM broadcasts, it continued to provide live programming daily from the Barnstaple studios via its website and iPhone app. In January 2012, The Voice moved from its location on The Square to new temporary studios above 21 High Street, Barnstaple sharing space with The Olden Group. The Voice planned to apply for the North Devon commercial FM licence in 2011, but shortly before the renewal date Now Digital submitted a proposal to Ofcom to extend DAB coverage in to North Devon,DAB in North Devon, OfCom, 1 June 2011 which would allow Heart Devon to automatically retain the licence. Despite the vast majority of responses to the consultation being 'No', Ofcom approved the request,Now Digital Ltd request to extend the coverage area of the local radio multiplex licence for Exeter & Torbay, OfCom, 12 July 2011 effectively blocking The Voice from applying for the commercial licence.

The FM service was launched on Saturday 18 January 2014. The first record played was John Farnham, You're The Voice, followed by a new version of Eternal Flame (which was the first record played on North Devon's first commercial station in 1992) by local band Zamba. The song was specially commissioned for the launch of The Voice on FM. The FM service is broadcast on two frequencies; 106.1 for Barnstaple and surrounding areas and 107.8 for Bideford and Ilfracombe.

The storm caused $45 million (2011 USD) in damage. Meteorological history Patrick formed as a weak low just south of Newfoundland on 24 December. The system moved across the north Atlantic, deepening rapidly to by Christmas Day. On 26 December, Patrick made landfall in western Norway with a central pressure of . The storm continued to move eastwards at a rapid pace, however, as it was overland it had weakened significantly. It hit Finland the same day, St. Stephen's Day (Tapani in Finnish), and got the Finnish name due to that day. It then moved out of the Free University of Berlin's tracking charts the next day. Damaged outbuilding in Norway Impact Norway Damage in Molde, Norway Patrick (Dagmar) arrived in Norway as a southwesterly storm, with windspeeds estimated to be on the coast. Powerful winds occurred in Sogn og Fjordane, M√∏re og Romsdal and Tr√∏ndelag during the night of 24 December and early morning of 25 December. Extreme high storm surge in Finnmark estimated to be over normal sea levels, although this was due to the preceding storm Cato (Oliver). In Norway comparison was made with the New Year's Day Storm of 1992, however this storm was not as strong Patrick (Dagmar) is believed to be the third strongest storm to hit Norway in 50 years. A large landslide on 1 January 2012 close to the Norwegian city of Trondheim has been attributed to the warm weather and large amounts of rain the system brought to the area, which resulted in 50 people being evacuated. The pier area of Trondheim was badly damaged during the storm, heavily damaging the fa√ßade of the Pirbadet water park. A F2 tornado was reported in Hellesylt, Norway. The Tanker BW Thames was disabled and adrift northwest of Bergen as the storm approached, however the crew were able to regain power and survived the storm without incident. The Russian trawler Krasnoselsk sank in Hundeidvika harbour, Sykkylven, Norway. Dagmar knocked out 390 Telenor communication masts leaving 40,000 customers without mobile or landline telephone connections. Royal Dutch Shell's Ormen Lange gas processing plant was inoperable after its electricity was cut off by the storm, which left gas supplies in the UK vulnerable as this facility can supply up to 20 percent of the UK's supply via the Langeled pipeline. Sweden Storm Dagmar mostly affected Southern Norrland and northern Svealand. The Swedish transport authority suspended all train traffic north of G√§vle at 20:00 on Christmas Day in preparation. Many trees fell in the storm, bringing down power lines and blocking roads and railways. Approximately 170,000 households were left without power between Uppland and V√§sterbotten, some for several days. Train traffic came to a standstill in Norrland, however the principal north-south route of the country (European route E4) was quickly cleared. Several weather stations in the Norrland interior experienced their strongest wind gusts in 15 years. Winds of were recorded on the pylons of the H√∂ga Kusten Bridge. 1.2 million Swedish Kronor of damage was caused in Ljusdal when sixteen rail wagons weighing were blown along the railway for until they derailed on a road intersection. Some 40,000 homes were still without power around 14:00 on December 27. Finland Patrick (Tapani) was dubbed the worst storm in Finland in 10 years. Thousands of customers were left without electricity in Southern Finland. The storm was a rare event in Finland and gave the warmest Christmas period in half a century. An old man is reported to have died after being hit by a falling tree. Estonia Patrick left 100,000 homes without power in Estonia, and triggered 600 rescue operations. Eesti Energia reassigned its customer services personnel to answer emergency calls. Patrick also brought record high temperatures to the country for December. Flooding was reported in the streets of major cities. Russia The Saint Petersburg Dam gates were closed to protect the city, preventing 15 ships from entering the port. The storm tore metal sheeting from roofs and many trees were brought down. Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant was also affected, as algae and mud stirred up by the storm were sucked into the cooling system, resulting in one of the generators being shut down. Aftermath Deutsche Bank estimated that the price of wood could fall by up to 15%.

The primary function of a spreader is to act as a continuous spreading machine in large-scale open pit mining operations. Bucket-wheel excavators, BWEs, are used for continuous overburden removal in surface mining applications. They use their cutting wheels to strip away a section of earth (the working block) dictated by the size of the excavator. The overburden is then delivered to the discharge boom, which transfers the cut earth to another machine for transfer it to the central collection area where the material will be sorted. Then the remains of the overburden will be transported to the spreader which then scatters the overburden at the dumping ground. The purpose of the spreader is to receive overburden from the haulage conveyor from the sorting area and dump it in an orderly and efficient manner. { Bild 4.

Gold Creek flows into Sheep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia.N.L. Barlee, Gold Creeks and Ghost Towns of Northeastern Washington., Hancock House Publishers., 2004 The Gold Creek Basin is located around Gold Creek. Lost Doukhobor Ledge In the fall of 1929, a lightning strike caused a fire in Gold Creek Basin. The area is beyond Hubbard Ridge, north of Flagstaff Mountain. A crew of twenty-five men was sent from Rossland, British Columbia to help put the fire out. Most of the men were Doukhobors. The fire jumped the fireguard that the men had built and the men‚Äôs camp was engulfed in flames. The firefighters ran for their lives. Later, after a headcount the men realized two of their crew were missing. In the morning the two Doukhobors who were missing joined their crew. The Doukhobors related how they managed to keep ahead of the flames. They spent the night at the base of a rock slide and discovered a vein of galena. The Doukhobors took samples back with them. A workman named Ray Wiley remembers, \\"it was fine-grained argentite ‚Äì high-grade silver ore.\\" The ore was assayed at CM&S; Co. assay office in Trail, British Columbia. The ore assayed at over 1,000 ounces of silver a ton ‚Äì bonanza ore. In 1930 the Doukhobors accompanied with geologists returned looking for the rock slide with the rich silver ledge of galena. They were unable to find it. Since then many prospectors have searched Gold Creek Basin for the lost Doukhobor Ledge. All attempts to find the silver ledge have failed.

AT&T; Cotton Bowl. Retrieved January 1, 2014. Matchup Texas A&M; Texas A&M; was ranked fourth in the AP Poll entering the game. The Aggies won the Southwest Conference and came into the game with a 12‚Äì0 record. The team was led on offense by running back Greg Hill, who rushed for more than 1,300 yards on the season, but he was one of five players suspended for the bowl game after an investigation found that they accepted payment from a team booster. Defensive back Aaron Glenn led the Aggie defense with six interceptions that year. Notre Dame Notre Dame (9‚Äì1‚Äì1) was ranked fifth and featured quarterback Rick Mirer and running backs Reggie Brooks and Jerome Bettis. Brooks finished fifth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy that season. Bettis rushed for 825 yards on the season. In both 1991 and 1992, Bettis finished third in the NCAA in rushing touchdowns. The selection of Texas A&M;'s opponent generated controversy weeks before the game was played. Notre Dame was chosen by the Cotton Bowl's board of directors, who faced criticism for not selecting the third-ranked Florida State Seminoles. Barry Horn and Darryl Richards of the Dallas Morning News wrote that \\"the Cotton Bowl not only ignored the wishes of its host school and what many believe is the intent of the first-year Bowl Coalition, but the desire of its new network partner as well.\\" NBC Sports televised both the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl that season. The network preferred to have Notre Dame play in its primetime broadcast of the Orange Bowl rather than the Cotton Bowl. Texas A&M; would have preferred to face the higher-ranked Seminoles. Board members for the Cotton Bowl said that they considered several factors, including the potential for ticket sales and the wishes of the network. Board members pointed out the Texas A&M-Florida; State matchup at the 1992 Cotton Bowl Classic, saying that they preferred to avoid a rematch in consecutive years. Notre Dame honored the invitation of the Cotton Bowl board. Game summary During the first possession of the game, Texas A&M; recovered a fumble that occurred on a pitch from Mirer to Brooks but did not score. Notre Dame threw 15 passes in the first half and scored just before halftime to make the score 7‚Äì0. The Fighting Irish threw only three passes in the second half and its rushing game took control. Notre Dame had a run of 34 consecutive running plays at one point in the second half. The team netted 290 rushing yards, including 115 yards from Brooks, 75 yards from Bettis and 55 rushing yards from Mirer. Mirer finished with 119 passing yards. Bettis scored three of the team's four touchdowns. In the second half, Texas A&M; recovered a fumble by Brooks at their own 4-yard line. Two plays later, Texas A&M; quarterback Corey Pullig fumbled the ball and Notre Dame recovered. The Aggies scored their only points on a 41-yard field goal in the fourth quarter.

A former member of the Lavender Menace, she co- authored Sappho Was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism with Barbara Love, and was one of the most vocal and active members in the National Organization for Women, helping the organization to focus on not just women's rights in general, but lesbian rights, as well. Life and career Sidney Afton Abbott was born in 1937 into a military family, describing herself as a military brat. She attended Smith College for three years, and graduated from the University of New Mexico in 1961. She then attended Columbia University for graduate school, studying urban planning. In 1969 she joined the National Organization for Women (NOW) and became one of the first people to speak out for lesbian rights on panels at the New York chapter of NOW and at Columbia University. Abbott was a member of the Lavender Menace and co-authored Sappho Was a Right-on Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism in 1971, with Barbara Love. In the mid-1970s, with Barbara Love, she lobbied for a NOW task force to be established to focus on lesbian issues, eventually it was established. NOW first named the task force the \\"sexuality and lesbian task force,\\" and Abbott had to co-chair with a heterosexual woman. At the NOW national conference in Philadelphia in 1976, Abbott demanded that 1% of the organizations budget should go to the task force, and succeeded. During the conference, it was only one of two resolutions to pass. Abbott served on the founding board of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and worked to ensure the organization's board was equal numbers gay men and lesbian women. She was named by the Manhattan Borough President to the community planning board; she was the first openly gay person to do so. She also served as program developer for two departments in the New York City government. She was co-chair for the New York Performing Arts Center, and was politically active in the North Fork area of Long Island, New York. Abbott and Kate Millett, Phyllis Birkby, Alma Routsong, and Artemis March were among the members of CR One, the first lesbian-feminist consciousness-raising group. Later years Abbott lived in Southold, New York. In 2007, she founded the Women's Rights are Human Rights nonprofit.

Cavall was Arthur's \\"favourite dog\\", and during a stag hunt, he was customarily the last dog to be let loose to chase after the game (Gereint Son of Erbin). Historia Brittonum Sketch of a footprint stone from Carn Cavall, Lady Guest's Mabinogion (1849) Legend in antiquity has it that Cabal left his permanent footprint in the rock while pursuing the boar Troynt. The lore is preserved in the Wonders of Britain (De Mirabilibus Britanniae or Mirabilia in shorthand) appended to Historia Brittonum (9th century). The wondrous nature of this cairn of stones was that even if someone removed that foot-printed stone to another spot, it would be back at its original heap the next day. Culhwch ac Olwen Unlike the simple primitive lore, the late Welsh romance Culhwch and Olwen weaves a much more intricate tale, naming many dogs besides Cavall in the hunting party, and the quarry is no longer just the boar Twrch Trwyth itself, its seven offspring (with names), and yet another boar named Yskithyrwyn besides. Ysgithyrwyn Chief-Boar Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd (or Ysgithyrwyn Chief Boar) was yet another boar to be hunted by Arthur's band; its tusk, which needed to be extracted while still alive, being another of the \\"impossible tasks\\" (anoeth; pl. anoethiau) prescribed by Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant. This tusk was the tool necessary for shaving the giant to groom him up, him being the father of the bride Olwen. In Culhwch and Olwen, Arthur's dog Cavall is specifically credited with the slaying of Yskithyrwin (or at least with cornering the beast to its doom). Caw of Prydain who rides Arthur's mare Llamrei cleaves Yskithyrwyn's head with a hatchet. Afterwards, \\"Bedwyr leading Cavall, Arthur's own dog\\", / a bedwyr a chauall ki arthur ynyl w ynteu. p. 239 joins the other hunters and dogs to pursue the great boar Twrch Trwyth and its piglets. But the specific role played by Cavall is not told.

(Glythfyr Ledewig). =Cavall the horse= Glas, Glesig, and Gleisad are referred to as dogs, and Call, Cuall, and Cafall as horses, and so on down the line, in the list of belongings of sons of Cleddyf, or, at least they are nowadays in modern translations.Such as Gwyn & Thomas Jones', 1949 and Jeffrey Gantz's, 1976. However, in the first English translation by Lady Guest, Glas, etc. were construed as sword names and Call, Cuall, Cavall as dogs, respectively. Etymology Ifor Williams has made a study of occurrences of Cafall in old Welsh poetry., notes that Ifor Williams has studied \\"..instances of cafall < Lat. caballus..in the Hengerdd(old poetry) CA 1203; CLlH vii, 22a; PT 38n. on caffon. (Ifor Williams, CA=Canu Aneirin, 1938; CLlH=Canu Llywarch Hen, 1935; PT=Poems of Taliesin) A number of scholars seem to hit upon the similarity of the dog's name to the Latin word for \\"horse\\". In an article from 1936, R. J. Thomas said that \\"the name Cabal is from Latin caballus 'horse', which he considers a quite natural metaphor since the dog was strong and swift, and he compares the horse of Conall Cernach which had a dog's head\\"., summarizing from R. J. Thomas, \\"Cysylltiad Arthur gogledd Ceredigion\\", Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 8 (2): 124‚Äì125.

Generally press tools are categorized by the types of operation performed using the tool, such as blanking, piercing, bending, forming, forging, trimming etc. The press tool will also be specified as a blanking tool, piercing tool, bending tool etc.Cyril Donaldson, George H LeCain, V C Goold, Tool design 3rd edition, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, New Delhi. Classification of press tools  Blanking tool Blanking Tool # Blanking is a punching operation in which entire periphery is cut out and the cut out portion required is known as STAMP OR BLANK. *When a component is produced with one single punch and die where the entire outer profile is cut in a single stroke the tool is called a blanking tool. *Blanking is the operation of cutting flat shapes from sheet metal. *The outer area of metal remaining after a blanking operation is generally discarded as waste. *Size of blank or product is the size of the die & clearance is given on punch. *It is a metal cutting operation. In blanking metal obtained after cutting is not a scrap or it is usable. *The size of the blank depends on the size of the die. *So the size of the die opening is equal to the blank size. *Clearance is given to the punch. Piercing tool Piercing tool Piercing involves cutting of clean holes with a resulting scrap slug. The operation is called die cutting and can also produce flat components where the die, the shaped tool, is pressed into a sheet material employing a shearing action to cut holes. This method can be used to cut parts of different sizes and shapes in sheet metal, leather and many other materials. Cut off tool Cutoff tool it is a shearing operation in which blanks are separated from a sheet metal .strip by cutting the opposite sides of the part in sequence . Parting off tool are similar, in that a discrete part is cut from a sheet or strip of metal along a desired geometric path. The difference between a cutoff and a parting is that a cutoff can be nestled perfectly on the sheet metal, due to its geometry. With cutoffs, the cutting of sheet metal can be done over one path at a time and there is practically no waste of material. With partings, the shape can not be nestled precisely. Parting involves cutting the sheet metal along two paths simultaneously. Partings waste a certain amount of material, that can be significant. Trimming tool When cups and shells are drawn from flat sheet metal the edge is left wavy and irregular, due to uneven flow of metal. Shown is flanged shell, as well as the trimmed ring removed from around the edge. While a small amount of Material is removed from the side of a component in trimming tool. Trimming Tool Shaving tool Shaving removes a small amount of material around the edges of a previously blanked stampings or piercing. A straight, smooth edge is provided and therefore shaving is frequently performed on instrument parts, watch and clock parts and the like. Shaving is accomplished in shaving tools especially designed for the purpose. it is also required proper die clearance Forming tool Forming is the operation of deforming a part in curved profile. Forming tools apply more complex forms to work pieces. The line of bend is curved instead of straight and the metal is subjected to plastic flow or deformation. Drawing tool Drawing tools transform flat sheets of metal into cups, shells or other drawn shapes by subjecting the material to severe plastic deformation. Shown in fig is a rather deep shell that has been drawn from a flat sheet. It is an axial elongation through the application of axial force. Drawing Tool This type of Press tool is used to perform only one particular operation therefore classified under stage tools. Progressive tool A progressive tool differs from a stage tool in the following respect: in a progressive tool the final component is obtained by progressing the sheet metal or strip in more than one stage. At each stage the tool will progressively shape the component towards its final shape, with the final stage normally being cutting-off. Compound tool The compound tool differs from progressive and stage tools by the arrangement of the punch and die. It is an inverted tool where blanking and piercing takes place in a single stage and also the blanking punch will act as the piercing die. Combination tool In a combination tool two or more operations such as bending and trimming will be performed simultaneously. Two or more operations such as forming, drawing, extruding, embossing may be combined on the component with various cutting operations like blanking, piercing, broaching and cut off takes place- it can perform a cutting and non cutting operations in a single tool. General press tool construction The general press tool construction will have following elements:- *Shank: It is used as a part for installing the Press tool die in the slide of the press machine with proper alignment. *Top Plate: It is used to hold top half of the press tool with press slide. It is also called Bolster Plate. *Punch Back Plate : This plate prevents the hardened punches penetrating into top plate. It is also called Pressure Plate or Backup plate. *Punch Holder: This plate is used to accommodate the punches of press tool. *Punches : To perform cutting and non cutting operations either plain or profiled punches are used. *Die Plate: Die plate will have similar profile of the component where cutting dies usually have holes with land and angular clearance and non cutting dies will have profiles. *Die Back Plate:This plate prevents the hardened Die inserts penetrating into bottom plate. *Guide Pillar & Guide Bush : Used for alignment between top and bottom halves of the press tools. *Bottom plate:It is used to hold bottom half of the press tool with press slide. *Stripper plate: it is used to strip off the component from punches. *Strip guides: It is used to guide the strip into the press tool to perform the operation. Press tool Cutting force in press tool In general, cutting force (CF) can be calculated using the formula: CF =L x S x Œ∂max Cutting force will be in Newton(N) Where, L = Cut length in mm,(perimeter of profile to be cut) Ex: 40 mm square to be cut will have cut length of 160 mm S = Sheet metal thickness in mm, Œ∂max = Maximum shear strength of sheet metal in MPa  Stripping force  Stripping force will be usually 10 to 20 % of cutting force  Press force  The Press force is the cutting force added to the stripping force: Press Force = Cutting force + Stripping force  Fits in press tools  * Punch holder and Punches =H7/k6 * Punch and Stripper = H7/K6 * Guide Pillar and Guide bush = H7/g6 * Guide bush and Top plate = H7/p6 * Guide pillar and bottom plate = H7/p6 * Dowel and plate = H7/m6 * Dowel holes = H7/r6  References  Machine tools Presswork ","title":"Types of press tools"},{"id":"34280404","title":"2011 Asian Airgun Championships"},{"id":"34280413","text":"CUNP may refer to: * Certified Urologic Nurse Practitioner, see Nursing credentials and certifications * Chinese Union Version with New Punctuation, an updated Chinese translation of Bible ","title":"CUNP"},{"id":"34280451","text":"Alan Baxter may refer to: * Alan Baxter (actor) (1908‚Äì1976), American film actor * Alan Baxter (author) (born 1970), British-Australian author * Alan Baxter (politician) (1912‚Äì1976), New Zealand politician See also *Alain Baxter (born 1973), British skier *Allan Baxter (disambiguation) ","title":"Alan Baxter"},{"id":"34280454","text":"Watashi wo Mitsukete is the third album by Yoko Takahashi.

He was the son of Richard Harper of Latton, Harlow, Essex and his wife Constance, the daughter of Sir Robert Chamberlain of Capel and Gedding, Suffolk. In November 1524, George Harper married his first wife, Lucy, the daughter of Thomas Peckham. She died in 1552. By June 1556, Harper had married again, to Audrey Gainsford, widow of George Taylor of Lingfield, Surrey, and daughter of Sir John Gainsford (d.1540) of Crowhurst, Surrey, by his fifth wife, Audrey Shaa, daughter of Sir John Shaa, Lord Mayor of London.Harper, George (1503‚Äì58), of Sutton Valence, Kent and London, History of Parliament. Retrieved 14 December 2013.  Political career  In February 1547, Harper was knighted. He held several offices. He was Esquire of the body by 1533; Justice of the Peace for Kent from 1539 to 1547; keeper of the manor of Penshurst, Kent 1543; Sheriff of Kent from 1548 to 1549 and held several commissions. George Harper had been the ward of his grandfather after his father's death. After the death of his grandfather, Harper's stepfather, Alexander Culpeper, purchased his wardship for ¬£180. The Culpepers were a well-known Kentish family during the sixteenth-century. At the age of 21, he married his stepfather's great-niece Lucy Peckham. He became a courtier at the court of Henry VIII, and became an esquire of the body. During the Lincolnshire Rising in 1536, Harper was trusted to carry letters between the King and the Duke of Suffolk, who was leading the King's troops against the protesters. Although the Harpers were from Essex, his stepfather, and his first wife, held most of their lands in Kent. Harper's dispute with Lucy led to legal proceedings; she had appealed to the King's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, that Harper was refusing to support her, because she would not put half her lands in his possession. In 1540, the King married Catherine Howard, whose mother was Joyce Culpeper, a distant relative of Harper's stepfather. In 1540, Harper secured a private Act (32 Hen. VIII, c.72) against his wife, giving him much of what she had inherited from her brother, including the manor of Horne Place in Kent. Harper's half-brother, Thomas Culpeper, was a prominent courtier and a favourite of the King's, so much so that he was trusted to sleep in, or at the foot of, the King's bed. In 1541, accusations were made that Thomas Culpeper was having an affair with the Queen. Both Queen Catherine and Culpeper were executed in February 1542. Culpeper was attainted and his lands given to the crown, but Harper had remained in favour, and was given some of his half-brother's lands, including the manor of Penshurst, Kent. From his brother-in-law, Nicholas Clifford, he inherited the manor of Sutton Valence, which became his chief residence in Kent. Harper spent much time in the 1540s overseas, and was involved in the conquest of Boulogne in 1544. After the town had been won by the English, Harper remained, organising transport. He was commended by Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk for his role. He suffered a gunshot wound in Boulogne. On 29 December 1544, Harper was elected knight of the shire for Kent. The Parliament next met in November 1545. Expecting a French invasion, Harper was involved in improving the defences of Kent, the English county nearest France. He had some association with John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and when Mary I of England reclaimed the throne from Jane Grey, she ordered him to come to court and be given a general pardon for any treason he may have been involved in. The next year there was widespread discontent at the Queen's marriage to Philip II of Spain, and Harper joined the rebellion led by Thomas Wyatt the younger. He changed sides several times and was eventually imprisoned in the Tower of London, but pardoned without trial on 6 November 1555.  Death  Harper wrote his will on 8 November 1558, naming his second wife, Audrey, as executrix and residuary legatee. He died in December 1558, at his house in the Blackfriars, London. On 12 December he was buried in St. Martin's church, Ludgate. His widow married George Carleton, and died in January 1560. After her death his lands were inherited by his sister's son-in-law, William Isley. He had no children; the children born to his first wife during their marriage, two sons and three daughters, were recognised as the offspring of Sir Richard Morison.

Life Born at Windsor in August 1813, he was the son of Isaac Weld (d. 1824) of Dublin, by his second marriage of 1812, to Lucy, only daughter of Eyre Powell of Great Connell, Kildare; he was therefore half- brother to Isaac Weld. In 1820 he accompanied his parents to France, where they occupied a ch√¢teau near Dijon. After his father's death he attended classes at Trinity College, Dublin, but took no degree. In 1839 Weld went to London and became secretary to the Statistical Society. He studied at the Middle Temple and was called to the bar on 22 November 1844; but, advised by Sir John Barrow, he became in 1845 assistant secretary and librarian to the Royal Society, a post which he held for sixteen years. The senior secretary at the time was Peter Mark Roget, who encouraged Weld's historical work. In 1861 he resigned his post at the Royal Society, and became a partner in the publishing business with Lovell Reeve. He was in charge of the philosophical department of the 1862 International Exhibition in London, and a district superintendent of the exhibition. He represented Great Britain at the Paris Exhibition of 1867. Weld died suddenly at his residence (since 1865), Bellevue, New Bridge Hill, near Bath, on 15 January 1869. A portrait of Charles Richard Weld is prefixed to the posthumous ‚ÄòNotes on Burgundy‚Äô which he was preparing for the press at the time of his death. Works His best- known work, A History of the Royal Society with Memoirs of the Presidents, compiled from Authentic Documents (London), appeared in two volumes in 1848 . The book was illustrated by drawings made by Mrs. Weld, and was a supplement to the histories of Thomas Birch and Thomas Thomson. An appendix to the volumes, the Descriptive Catalogue of the Portraits in the possession of the Royal Society,‚Äô compiled by Weld for the council in 1860. Weld wrote a series of Vacation Tours. They were: *‚ÄòAuvergne, Piedmont, and Savoy; a Summer Ramble,‚Äô (1850); *‚ÄòA Vacation Tour in the United States and Canada,‚Äô (1854) dedicated to Isaac Weld, whose ‚ÄòTravels in North America‚Äô had appeared in 1799; *‚ÄòA Vacation in Brittany‚Äô (1856); *‚ÄòA Vacation in Ireland‚Äô (1857); *‚ÄòThe Pyrenees, West and East‚Äô (1859); *‚ÄòTwo Months in the Highlands, Orcadia and Skye‚Äô (1860); *‚ÄòLast Winter in Rome‚Äô (1865); *‚ÄòFlorence the New Capital of Italy‚Äô (1867); and * ‚ÄòNotes on Burgundy,‚Äô edited by his wife after his death in 1869. Many of these books were illustrated by the author's own sketches. Weld was the main assistant of Sir John Franklin in the organisation of his Arctic explorations, and was an authority on polar matters connected with the polar circle. He issued in 1850 a lecture on Arctic Expeditions, originally delivered at the London Institution on 6 February 1850, and this was followed by pamphlets on the search for Franklin during 1851. His report on the Philosophical Instruments and Apparatus for Teaching Science for the Exposition Universelle was printed, and then abridged for the Illustrated London News (5 October 1867). Family In 1842 he married Anne, daughter of Henry Selwood and niece of Sir John Franklin; her elder sister, Emily, married Alfred Tennyson, and her youngest sister, Louisa, married Charles Tennyson Turner.

It offers a website and app that aims to assist users in making personal financial decisions. History NerdWallet was founded in August 2009 by Tim Chen and Jacob Gibson, with an initial capital investment of $800. Its first product was a web application that provided comparative information about credit cards. Subsequently, it generated large quantities of content to help boost its search engine results. Website traffic grew quickly in 2010 and, by March 2014, the website had up to 30 million users. The following year, it raised $64 million in its first round of funding, at an estimated valuation of $500 million. In 2016, the company acquired the retirement planning firm AboutLife and NerdWallet was valued at $520 million. In 2017, company growth slowed, resulting in the layoff of 11 percent of its employees. Products and services The company's goal is to provide information that educates users in making financial decisions. They do so by providing both reviews and comparison of different financial products, including credit cards, banking, investing, loans and insurance. Its web site is directed primarily towards Millennials and provides information on credit card selection, college loans, banking, mortgage loans, stock trading and insurance policies. By May 2015, the company had developed business relationships with eight banks and a dozen insurance companies. In exchange for new customers, affiliated banks pay NerdWallet a success fee. Co-founder Chen reported that the company became profitable by virtue of the fees it earned through matching users with financial products and services.

The association was formed through the amalgamation of two earlier groupings. The Birmingham Architectural Society was founded in 1851 with the aim of holding regular meetings between senior local members of the profession and providing an architectural library. The Birmingham and District Architectural Association was formed in 1874 for younger members of the profession. The two were closely related, with a member of the senior society being elected as the President of the junior grouping, and by 1895 the two had combined into a single organisation under the Birmingham Architectural Association name. The Birmingham School of Architecture can trace its origins to a series of classes held by the association in 1908. By 1933, membership had expanded to include architects from the area surrounding the city. In that year the name of the association was changed to the Birmingham and Five Counties Architectural Association to reflect its representation in the counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire ‚Äì the area of the modern West Midlands Region. Chapters were set up throughout the district and studentships were awarded for the first time. In 1968, the Royal Institute of British Architects reorganised into a comprehensive regional structure. The regional role of the Birmingham association was taken over by the new West Midlands Region of the RIBA, and the BAA returned to its original name and role representing the architects of the city, as the largest of the new region's six affiliated societies.

Husayn belonged to the Ridwan family, who long held the governorship of Gaza. Husayn Pasha became governor in 1644 after succeeding his father 'Arab Hasan Pasha. He served, with a brief interruption by his son Ibrahim in 1660, until his imprisonment in 1662. Husayn Pasha also served intermittent terms as governor of Nablus and Jerusalem and as amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan). Gaza prospered under Husayn Pasha and its political importance rose so much so that the French consul considered it to be the virtual capital of Palestine. Husayn Pasha maintained friendly relations with the Bedouin tribes of the region, local Christian communities and the French. In 1662, Husayn Pasha was imprisoned by the Ottoman imperial authorities and executed in Damascus later that year or in Constantinople in 1663. Biography In the mid-17th century Husayn Pasha served as governor of Jerusalem and Nablus.Ze'evi 1996, p. 41. From 1524, his family, the Ridwan dynasty, had administered much of Palestine and parts of the Lebanon and Syria on behalf of their Ottoman superiors based in Constantinople and Damascus.Dowling 1913, pp. 70-71 Husayn Pasha was also appointed amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan). This position entrusted him with provisioning and protecting the annual Hajj pilgrim caravan from Bedouin raids while the pilgrims traversed the desert route to Mecca in the Hejaz. Governor of Gaza Husayn inherited the governorship of Gaza from his father 'Arab Hasan Pasha following the latter's removal from the post in 1644. Prior to the assumption of this post, Gaza was in an impoverished economic state and the Ridwan family was greatly indebted. In 1656, the Ottoman central authorities, wary of Husayn Pasha's overarching influence in Palestine, attempted to implicate Husayn Pasha in a corruption scandal regarding unclear cash and property transactions in a Nablus-based meeting between himself, his brother-in-law Assaf Pasha, a group of notables from Jabal Nablus and an Ottoman official from Istanbul, Ismail Pasha. According to contemporary testimonies, a group of village headmen from Jabaliya apparently harmed by the Nablus deal went to Damascus to lodge a complaint to the authorities against Ismail Pasha. However, they were advised by the Ottoman authorities in Damascus to instead file the complaint against Husayn Pasha, in an effort to undermine his credibility.Ze'evi 1996, pp. 58-59. To restore Gaza's failing commerce sector, Husayn Pasha obtained a large loan from the French consul in Jerusalem, Chevalier d'Arvieux.Meyer 1907, p. 97. When pressed to pay in 1659, Husayn made strenuous efforts to produce the funds and promptly paid back d'Arvieux in a meeting in the town of Ramla. D'Arvieux then proceeded to lavish fine robes and cloth to show his gratitude to Husayn Pasha.Meyer 1907, p. 98. Husayn Pasha maintained a positive reputation among the Bedouin tribes who largely dominated the desert areas surrounding Gaza. This relationship resulted in a drastic fall in the previously routine armed conflict between the nomadic Bedouin and the settled population of Gaza and the nearby towns. According to his contemporary biographer, Muhammad Muhibbi, Husayn Pasha was able to subdue the Bedouin tribes and gain their cooperation.Ze'evi 1996, p. 53. The Bedouin tribal chiefs reportedly visited his court in Gaza to pay their respects. According to historian Martin Abraham Meyer, Husayn's influence over the Bedouin was \\"marked\\" and they ended their plundering campaigns against the city, allowing its economy to grow unhindered. A more able governor than his predecessor, Husayn Pasha was able to restore the Ridwan family's wealth, and Gaza entered into a period of prosperity. The status of the city was elevated to the point that d'Arvieux described it as the capital of Palestine. Husayn Pasha's rule over Gaza was considered beneficent,Mattar 2005, p. 171. and according to Meyer \\"all things prospered under his rule.\\" Economic activity at the time was principally agricultural and centered on the cultivation of grain. While industry was primitive, Gaza became a principal manufacturer of soap and wine. Husayn was well known throughout Palestine for his many charities and hospitality. In addition to the majority Muslim population, there existed large communities of Jews and Christians who thrived under Husayn's administration. Husayn maintained friendly relations with the various Christian communities in Palestine as well as the French missionaries. Unusual at the time for a Muslim ruler, he allowed local Christians to build a church near the Great Mosque of Gaza, repair already existing churches throughout the province and construct hospices. He appointed his son Ibrahim as governor of Jerusalem and later on handed over to him his post as governor of Gaza, the Ridwan dynasty's stronghold. He retained the office of governor of Nablus and continued to command the annual Hajj pilgrimage from Damascus to Mecca. Husayn Pasha restored himself as governor of Gaza in 1661 when Ibrahim was killed in an Ottoman-ordered punitive expedition against Druze rebels in Mount Lebanon. Imprisonment and death Anonymous petitions were sent to the Ottoman capital Istanbul decrying his leadership of the Hajj caravan, which was justification enough for the Ottoman authorities to depose him. Thus, during the caravan‚Äôs stop at the Muzayrib fortress en route to Mecca, Husayn Pasha was arrested and then imprisoned in Damascus. Shortly after, he was transferred to Constantinople where he was killed while incarcerated in 1662-63. Historian Jean-Pierre Filiu asserts that Husayn Pasha was executed in the Damascus citadel in 1662.Filiu 2014, p. 27. Mourning Husayn Pasha's death, the Damascene poet Abd as-Samman al-Dimashqi wrote: > \\"He committed no crime, but these are days of envy's rule. Chained inside a > dungeon cell, they feared him as one would fear a sword in its > scabbard.\\"Ze'evi 1996, pp. 58-59. Husayn Pasha was succeeded by his brother Musa Pasha. According to historian Dror Ze'evi, \\"the Ottomans must have assumed that by killing Husayn Pasha, they ... would eventually be able to destroy the remnants of the extended dynasty.\\" Members of the Ridwan family continued to govern Gaza consecutively, but from a weakened position and with considerably less political influence. The last Ridwan governor was Musa Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha who ruled until 1690.Filiu 2014, p. 28. Personal life Traits While Muhibbi describes Arab Hasan Pasha as a reckless \\"spendthrift and hedonist\\", Husayn Pasha was described as a \\"paragon of perfection\\". Muhibbi claimed Husayn Pasha was handsome, noble and cultured and \\"a man of deeds whose reputation preceded him\\". Although Husayn Pasha was illiterate, he memorized several books of Arabic poetry and prose. He was further described as a \\"resolute leader\\" in war and politics. Family Husayn Pasha had a number of children, including adopted child relatives.Ze'evi 1996, p. 46. His son Ibrahim was killed in combat in 1661. He adopted his late sister's son Farrukh whose deceased father, Ali ibn Muhammad Farrukh, had been a leading amir himself. Husayn Pasha's daughter Shaqra Khatun was married to the amir Assaf Pasha.Ze'evi 1996, p. 47. Husayn Pasha had 85 siblings, most notable among them was Husayn's successor, Musa Pasha.Ze'evi 1996, p. 48. According to historian Theodore Dowling, Husayn's serai, today known as Qasr al-Basha, was lavishly furnished and stood in the middle of a garden. One of the servant families were the Frangi who were of Greek Catholic origin, but converted to Islam. Assalan Frangi was Husayn Pasha's secretary.

She was also loved by students in her writing classes at Harvard University and at the Harvard Extension School.

The former editor of the Atlantic Monthly, Robert Manning was a long-standing friend and said of Lamport: \\"She suffered fools politely, but not gladly. Having Felicia as a friend protected you from enemies on all sides. She was so loyal, in addition to being so entertaining and ingenious.\\" Lamport died on 23 December 1999, of pneumonia, at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the age of 83.

Early life William Imbrie was an 1865 graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and an 1870 graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary. He was ordained as a Presbyterian pastor in 1873. Missionary in Japan Imbrie arrived in Japan in 1875, where he became a professor of New Testament Exegesis at Meiji Gakuin University and later served as senior missionary in Tokyo. He was also the president of the Japanese Book and Tract Society and prepared materials to help Westerners learn the Japanese language. He was instrumental in working for Christian unity in Japan and helped shape what became the Church of Christ in Japan. In the so-called \\"Imbrie Affair\\" of 1890, Japanese students assaulted Imbrie during a baseball game. Imbrie arrived late to a game between students at the First Higher School of Tokyo (Ichiko) and Meiji Gakuin University, climbing over a hedge to gain admittance since the gates were locked. This action angered the supporters of the First Higher School, some of whom beat him until he fled from the field. While the press likely exaggerated the severity of the beating, the incident inflamed public opinion in the expatriate community.Donald Roden (2001). \\"Baseball and the Quest for National Dignity in Meiji Japan,\\" page 292. In John R. Dreifort (Ed.), Baseball History from Outside the Lines: A Reader, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2001. The American embassy complained about the incident, leading to an official apology from representatives of the Japanese government. As Robert Whiting relates, \\"foreign ministry officials, ranking Ichiko representatives, and several of the students involved paid a visit to Professor Imbrie's residence to beg his forgiveness, which the good professor granted.\\" Imbrie played a minor diplomatic role during the Russo-Japanese War. The commencement of hostilities in 1904 unsettled Christian missionaries. \\"At the outbreak of the war between Russia and Japan,\\" reported Galen Fisher, national secretary of the Y.M.C.A. Union of Japan, \\"fanatical or ignorant Japanese Buddhists started the slogan, 'Buddhism vs. Christianity,' which boded no good to missionaries and the Christian cause in Japan.\\" Later that year, Count Katsura Tar≈ç held an audience with Imbrie to articulate Japan's rationale for the war. In the interview, Katsura denied that any religious motive was at work. \\"With differences of race or religion‚Ä¶it has nothing to do; and it is carried on in the interests of justice, humanity, and the commerce and civilization of the world.\\" The dissemination of this interview paradoxically cast Japan as a defender of Christian civilization against Russian barbarism.Joseph M. Henning (2007). \\"White Mongols? The war and American discourses on race and religion,\\" page 155. In Rotem Kowner (Ed.), The Impact of the Russo-Japanese War, London: Routledge, 2007. In 1909, Imbrie was awarded the Fourth Degree of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government. Imbrie also served as the delegate of the American Presbyterian Mission in Japan (along with Ibuka Kajinosuke) at the 1910 World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. Legacy At the time of his death, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the USA commended Imbrie as \\"one of the oldest, most honored and most beloved of the foreign missionaries of the church...He was again and again relied upon in every crisis of missionary work or the Christian cause in Japan to propose the wisest course of action and to draft statements of policy and of public declaration. No one in the last half century has rendered more notable service in Japan than Dr. Imbrie.\\"\\"Foreign Board Commends Great Work of Dr. William Imbrie,\\" Alumni Files, Special Collections, Princeton Theological Seminary Library.

It is located in the Mexican state of Tabasco and part of the Cacao Route that the state promotes. While it is much smaller than it was before the Mexican Revolution, it still produces cacao and sugar cane along with organic earthworms for composting. The former main house for the hacienda is now a youth hostel and dormitory for students and the site provides a number of other tourism services. History The hacienda‚Äôs establishment has been dated to the year 1800, but little has been written about it. Oral tradition states that it was originally called La Chona in reference to the hundreds of acres of lands that originally belonged to it. In the 19th century, the hacienda was the property of the Cruces family, with the first known owner being Benito Cruces, the father of Santiago Cruces Zentella, the governor of Tabasco in the 1870s. The hacienda lost most of its lands during the Mexican Revolution and is now called La Chonita (‚Äúlittle Chona‚Äù). Much of the former property is now La Chonita Ejido. The main hacienda house, along with thirty hectares of property now belongs to a family named Fern√°ndez. Description Toasted cacao beans produced at the hacienda Dining area inside the main house The hacienda extends over thirty hectares located in the municipality of Cunduac√°n in the Chontalpa region of Tabasco. It is part of the Cacao Route along with various other chocolate haciendas such as La Luz and Jes√∫s Mar√≠a and the Comalcalco (archaeological site) archeological site. Today it is the property of Benito and Alfonso Fern√°ndez, who have preserved the house almost completely intact. The main room of the house contains photography done by former owner Santiago Cruces, as well as preserved specimens of a serpent locally called mazacoatl. The front yard has a small deep well, an old sugar mill and an area dedicated to the raising of earthworms. The hacienda grows cacao and sugar cane. Another important industry is the raising of organic earthworms for composting. In a closed section in the back of the property, iguanas, alligators and Central American river turtles are allowed to reproduce each year. It offers various services such as environmental education, workshops on how to prepare chocolate from cacao, Frisbee golf, classes on the plants and animals of Tabasco, bicycle and kayak rentals, fishing, camping and lodging. The hacienda sells chocolate products and local handcrafts. It is a youth hostel and it also provides student housing during the school year. It offers tours of its cacao and sugar fields. The temazcal sauna is relatively unknown in Tabasco although it was used by the Mayas. It is constructed to resemble a return to the maternal womb, spiritually that of Mother Earth. The hacienda has two temazcals, a more modern one with a cement roof and the other more traditional with a clay roof. It also has a building dedicated to recreational and therapeutic massage as well as space for indigenous inspired rites.

Life Born in Sussex to unknown parents, Lionel Gatford entered Jesus College, Cambridge in 1618, graduating B.A. in 1621‚Äì2. In 1625 he proceeded M.A. and became a fellow of Jesus. He was ordained deacon at Peterborough on 24 December 1626, and was elected junior university proctor in 1631-2. In 1633 he proceeded B.D. and became vicar of St Clement's Church, Cambridge. Disturbed by the theological views of Eleazar Duncon's 1633 DD commencement, which recommended bowing at the altar and suggested that \\"good works are efficaciously necessary to salvation\\", Gatford wrote a long letter on the subject to Lord Goring.Gatford to Lord Goring, 22 July 1633. Calendar of State Papers, Dom. 1633‚Äì4, pp. 150, 279. Resigning his Jesus fellowship in 1638, he was presented by another patron, Sir John Rous, to the rectory of Dennington, Suffolk in 1641.Venn and the ODNB agree on this date against the DNB, which gave 1637. Soon after the outbreak of the civil war, Gatford retired to Cambridge in order to write a pamphlet setting forth the doctrine of the church in regard to the obedience due to kings. On the night of 26 January 1642‚Äì3 Oliver Cromwell seized his manuscript, then in the press at Cambridge, arrested Gatford in his bed at Jesus College, and sent both author and copy to London. On 30 January the commons ordered him to be imprisoned in Ely House, Holborn.Commons' Journals, ii. 95. Nothing daunted he contrived to publish in the following March a vigorous onslaught on anabaptists and other Puritans, called An Exhortation to Peace. This was ordered by the commons on 3 July to be referred to the consideration of the committee for Cambridge.Commons' Journals, iii. 153. After seventeen months' confinement Gatford was freed in an exchange of prisoners. Banned from returning to Dennington or resuming work as a clergyman elsewhere, Gatford went to the royalist headquarters at Oxford, where he lived with the mayor, Thomas Smith. There he wrote a whimsical tract on the spiritual and bodily causes and effects of the plague raging in Oxford, ŒõœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ ·ºàŒªŒµŒæŒπœÜŒ¨œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÇ or Hyperphysicall Directions in Time of Plague (1644). Gatford soon after went to Cornwall as chaplain of Pendennis Castle.Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1661‚Äì2, p. 65 About July 1645 he drafted an address \\"to the valiant and loyal Cornish men\\", urging them to rise up in support of the royal cause.¬∑ Calendar of the Clarendon state papers preserved in the Bodleian Library, ed. O. Ogle and others, 5 vols. (1869‚Äì1970), i. 271‚Äì2. He was taken prisoner when Pendennis Castle surrendered in August 1646, and by 1647 he was exiled with the royalists in Jersey, becoming there a favourite of Sir Edward Hyde, who made him his chaplain.Cal. State Papers, i. 316, 368, 416, ii. 19 His next publication was A Faithfull and Faire Warning, reissued as Englands Complaint (1648): Gatford called upon \\"Inhabitants of the county of Suffolk\\" to help the royalist garrison at Colchester holding out against the New Model Army,Jason McElligott, Royalism, print and censorship in revolutionary England, Boydell Press, 2007, p.34 and expressed fears that parliament would grant toleration to Catholics, who would consequently return to power. Gatford appears to have remained in exile about seven years. After his return he supported himself by taking boarders, living at different times at Kenninghall Place, Sanden House, Kilborough, and Swaffham in Norfolk. From there he moved to Hackney, Middlesex, afterwards to Well Hall, Kent, and finally to Walham Green. Pursued by the county committees for persisting in keeping up the traditional Church of England service, he protested in A Petition for the Vindication of the Publique use of the Book of Common Prayer (1655), prefixed by a spirited letter to the parliament. Publick Good without Private Interest appeared in 1657. At the Restoration Gatford was created D.D. by royal mandate. He found the chancel and parsonage-house of Dennington in ruins, and, as he could not afford to have them rebuilt, petitioned the king for the vicarage of Plymouth in Devon, to which he was presented on 20 August 1661.Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1661‚Äì2, pp. 65, 68. Gatford's last literary labour was to defend his old patron, Sir John Rous, from puritan allegations of drunkenness in A true and faithfull Narrative of the ‚Ä¶ death of Mr. William Tyrrell (1661). In August 1662 Dr. George, the nonconformist vicar of Plymouth, was ejected, but the corporation elected Roger Ashton as his successor.Rowe, Parish and Vicars of St. Andrew, Plymouth, p. 39. In 1663 the right of appointing to the incumbency of Great Yarmouth was disputed between the corporation of the town and the dean and chapter of Norwich. Gatford, on the recommendation of Edward Hyde, now Earl of Clarendon and high steward of the borough, was accepted by the corporation, and allowed \\"to officiate as curate during the pleasure of the House.\\" Gatford died of the plague in 1665, and the corporation presented his widow Dorcas with ¬£100 in consideration of the \\"pains he had taken in serving the cure for two years\\".Palmer, Continuation of Manship, ii. 174‚Äì6; Perlustration of Great Yarmouth, iii. 10.

A member of the Venetian School of composers, he had a strong reputation as a master of counterpoint, and wrote both sacred and secular vocal music.Patricia Ann Myers, \\"Baccusi, Ippolito\\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, (accessed 4 January 2012). Little is known of his life other than the details of a few appointments, and what can be inferred from the dedications he wrote for his publications. He was born in Mantua. Sometime in the late 1560s he was appointed assistant director of the choir at San Marco in Venice, but he did not hold the position for long, going to Ravenna to study. In 1572 he was maestro di cappella at the church of Sant'Eufemia in Verona, where he may have been associated with the Veronese Accademia Filarmonica. On 14 November 1574 he was appointed maestro di cappella of the monastery of Santo Stefano in Venice, a position he resigned before 23 July 1575. By 1583 he held the maestro di cappella position at Mantua Cathedral, where among other things he taught counterpoint to Lodovico Zacconi, who mentioned him glowingly in his Prattica de musica seconda parte of 1622, particularly for his contrapuntal skill.Einstein, 512Fenlon, 25, 87 In 1592 Baccusi accepted the position of maestro di cappella at Verona Cathedral, where he remained for the rest of his life. Baccusi's music is in the Venetian style, influenced by Adrian Willaert, Giaches de Wert, Cipriano de Rore and Andrea Gabrieli. He was a prolific composer, but to date no significant study has been undertaken of his music. His works, mostly published in Venice, include six books of masses, six books of motets and psalm settings, and seven books of madrigals, including a complete setting as a madrigal cycle of Petrarch's 11-stanza Vergine. He also composed five- and six-voice settings of poems celebrating the Venetian victory over the Turks at Lepanto (1571). In the introductions to his 1596 and 1597 publications of masses and motets he mentioned the practice of instrumental doubling of vocal parts, something associated with the Venetian School; this is one of the first explicit references to a practice which had been going on for some time.

His tenure was notable for the fact that he succeeded his father as Chief Baron, and for his long struggle to retain the office against a rival claimant, Michael Gryffin.  Background  He was probably born at Dunboyne in County Meath, and he later lived at Dardistown in the same county. He was the son of James Cornwalsh and Matilda Rochfort; the Cornwalsh family were originally from Cornwall. His father was Chief Baron of the Exchequer, with intervals, from 1420 to 1441, when he was murdered by the Fitzwlliam family. John followed his father into the legal profession and went to London to study law; he was living at Tower Hill in 1434.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol.1 p.178 He is next heard of \\"fighting the King's enemies in Ossory\\" in 1441.Ball, p.178 In September of that year his father was murdered at the instigation of William Fitzwilliam and his wife Ismay, in a feud over the possession of Baggotrath Castle near Dublin. The fact that Fitzwilliam and Ismay received a royal pardon for the crime gives us a vivid glimpse of the lawless condition of Ireland at the time (although it must be said that the condition of England, under the inept rule of King Henry VI, was not much better).  Career  He was appointed Chief Baron soon after his father's death, probably on the advice of the powerful Anglo-Irish magnate James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, who had been a close associate of his father. However a few weeks later a patent was issued in London appointing Michael Gryffin to the same office.Ball, p.101 For five years Gryffin's supporters contrived to keep Cornwalsh out of office; finally in 1446 he obtained a declaration that his rival's letters patent had been obtained illegally.Griffiths, Ralph A. The Reign of Henry VI-the exercise of Royal Authority Ernest Benn Ltd. 1981 p.417 This conflict reflected the wider political divisions of the time, but Elrington Ball suggests that there were also valid objections to Cornwalsh's appointment as a judge.Ball, p.101 Despite his being the son of a long-serving jurist and despite his having studied law at the Inns of Court, his legal knowledge was thought to be insufficient to become a judge, although in his defence it may be said that his rival Gryffin apparently had no legal training at all. In addition Cornwalsh was a turbulent and unpopular individual: in the 1450s he quarreled with the Duke of York, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and with his Privy Council, and was accused of inciting the citizens of Dublin to rebellion.Ball, p.101 During York's final Irish Parliament in 1460, Cornwalsh was one of his few opponents, and an Act of Resumption, declaring his estates liable to forfeiture, was passed.Otway-Ruthven, A.J. A History of Mediaeval Ireland Barnes and Noble 1993 pp. 387-8 After York's death at the Battle of Wakefield no further action seems to have been taken against Cornwalsh, despite the triumph of York's son King Edward IV, the following year. Edward was generally willing to seek reconciliation with his former opponents: Cornwalsh remained in office until his death in 1472, and he was knighted around 1466. Family He married in 1444 Maud (or Matilda) Plunkett, widow of Richard Talbot of Malahide Castle, and also widow of Thomas Hussey, 5th Baron Galtrim, who was murdered on their wedding day, thus inspiring the nineteenth-century ballad \\"The Bride of Malahide\\".Burke's Peerage 4th Edition London 1833 Vol. 2 p.522 She was the daughter of Christopher Plunkett, first Baron Killeen. She died in 1482.Burke's Peerage p.522 Cornwalsh built Dardistown Castle, County Meath, in about 1465, and had possession of Malahide Castle and the Galtrim estates (roughly modern Summerhill, County Meath) for his lifetime in right of his wife.

The mark certifies that a product conforms to an Indian standard (IS) developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the national standards body of India. The ISI mark is by far the most recognised certification mark in the Indian subcontinent. The ISI is an initialism of Indian Standards Institution, the name of the national standards body until 1 January 1987, when it was renamed to the Bureau of Indian Standards. The ISI mark is mandatory for certain products to be sold in India, such as many of the electrical appliances like switches, electric motors, wiring cables, heaters, kitchen appliances, etc., and other products like Portland cement, LPG valves, LPG cylinders, automotive tyres, etc. In the case of most other products, ISI marks are optional.  Counterfeiting  It is very common in India to find products with fake ISI marks. That is, industrial traders cheat customers by affixing ISI marks on the product without actually getting certified. Fake ISI marks usually do not carry :(i) the mandatory 7-digit licence number (of the format CM/L-xxxxxxx, where x signifies a digit from the licence number) required by BIS; and :(ii) the IS number on top of the ISI mark which signifies the Indian standard a particular product is in compliance with. For example, if a kitchen grinder's box has a small ISI mark on it with the ISI code of the appliance's wire, one can conclude that the wire is BIS-certified but the appliance itself is not an BIS-certified product. Counterfeiting ISI marks is a punishable offence by the law, but enforcement is uncommon.

Hofmann (February 21, 1911 ‚Äì December 25, 1995) was an American biological chemist and medical researcher.New York Times:K. H. Hofmann, 84, Expert on Synthesis Of Body Compounds, By WOLFGANG SAXON, December 28, 1995National Academies Press:Biographical Memoirs V.81 (2002),KLAUS HOFMANN,BY FRANCES M. FINN AND BERT W. O‚ÄôMALLEY The New York Times called Hofmann an \\"expert on synthesis of body compounds\\". His career was highlighted by synthesis of a prototype birth control pill, isolation and structural characterization of biotin (vitamin H), determination of the lysine specificity of the pancreatic protease trypsin (an attribute that made it the enzyme of first choice in protein sequence determinations), the first chemical synthesis of a fully biologically-active portion of the peptide hormone (adrenocorticotopic hormone - ACTH),New York Times:Scientists Synthesize Substance Biologically Equal to ACTH; Molecule Has 23 Amino Acids Against Nature's 39 -- Aid to Pituitary Study Is Seen SCIENTISTS MAKE ACTH SUBSTITUTE;By WALTER SULLIVAN, December 02, 1960 and structure-function studies on ribonuclease (RNase). Early life and entry to science Hofmann was born in Germany but when his father died, his mother returned with her one-year-old son to her family home in Switzerland. The family was business oriented but Klaus was determined to pursue a career in science. He studied steroid chemistry at the Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich (ETH) in the laboratories of Leopold Ru≈æiƒçka. Here he developed a friendship with another faculty member, Tadeus Reichstein from whom he learned laboratory technique. For his postdoctoral experience he traveled to the United States to work with Max Bergmann on peptides, an entirely new field for him. From there he migrated across the street to the laboratory of Vincent du Vigneaud where he was introduced to a new vitamin, Biotin. The war years What was meant to be a short stay in the US turned into a much longer one as a result of World War II. Switzerland, ringed by hostile forces, advised Hofmann, an officer in the Swiss militia, not to return for the course of the war. He spent the war years working as a guest at Ciba Pharmaceutical Company in New Jersey. From there he moved to the University of Pittsburgh at a time when the institution was trying to build a research reputation. A scientific home in Pittsburgh In a few short years, the Dean of the School of Medicine, himself a professor of Biochemistry, invited Hofmann to become Chairman of the Department. From the moment he took the position of Chairman of Biochemistry, it became clear that although he would always be a son of Switzerland, the United States offered him career opportunities he could never hope for in a small country like Switzerland. The US was to become his permanent home. The burgeoning field of peptide chemistry became his scientific focus and, in his own words, he fell in love with a molecule that was known to stimulate the adrenal cortex to produce the very steroids that had so fascinated him in Reichstein's laboratory. That molecule, not yet isolated, was ACTH and the love affair was lifelong. Despite detours into other areas, he kept returning to ACTH. In the last years before his death, he was developing methods to isolate the ACTH receptor. Areas of scientific accomplishments Steroid Chemistry As a PhD student in the laboratories of future Nobel Laureates, Leopold Ruzicka and Tadeus Reichstein in Z√ºrich, Hofmann synthesized a number of compounds related to terpenes, the hypothetical building block of steroids. One of these was a dehydroandrosterone derivative, a prototype for the birth control pill. Unfortunately the biological basis for reproduction was not known for many years subsequent to this and therefore the importance of this compound was not recognized.Ruzicka, L and Hofmann, K.

Trypsin While working in the laboratory of Max Bergmann at Rockefeller Institute, now Rockefeller University, Hofmann synthesized analogs of the amino acid lysine and proved that the enzyme trypsin cleaves linkages involving the carboxyl group of that amino acid.Hofmann, K and Bergmann, M. The Specificity of Trypsin. II. J. Biol. Chem. 130 81-86 1939. Biotin Subsequently, with Vincent du Vigneaud, he used the newly developed technique of chromatography that he had learned while a student in Z√ºrich, to isolate and then crystallize biotin.du Vigneaud, V., Hofmann, K., Melville, D.

He applied this to peptides as well. Peptide synthesis/ACTH The first chemical synthesis of an active peptide hormone, the nine amino acid cyclic peptide, oxytocin, was achieved in 1954 by du Vigneauddu Vigneaud, V. Ressler, C. Swan, J.

Soc. 74 2120-21 1952. suggested that a structure comprising only the first 24 amino acids had full biological activity. It was apparent from the outset that ACTH contained the amino acid Arginine and thus methods had to be developed for the incorporation of this basic amino acid into peptides. Hofmann and his group set about this task.Hofmann, K, Rheiner, A. and Peckham, W. D. Studies on Polypeptides. V. The Synthesis of Arginine Peptides. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 75 6083 1953.

RNaseA In 1959, Fred Richards discovered that a proteolytic enzyme, Subtilisin, had the ability to cleave the enzyme Ribonuclease A into two components, a peptide corresponding to the first 20 amino acids of the enzyme (S-Peptide) and the remainder of the protein (S-Protein).Richards, F. M. and Vithayathil, P. J. The Preparation of Subtilisin-modified Ribonuclease and the Separation of the Peptide and Protein Components. J. Biol. Chem. 234 1459-65 1959. When separated from one another, each piece was inactive but when they were simply mixed together, full enzymatic activity was restored. Hofmann speculated that this system might be a model for the way peptide hormones interact with their receptors.Hofmann, K. Preliminary Observations Relating Structure and Function in Some Pituitary Hormones. Brookhaven Symposia in Biology 13 184-202 1960. Structure-function studies with ACTH were complicated by the necessity to assess activity in the whole animal. The S-Peptide:S-Protein system afforded a simple system with none of the biological complications inherent in testing ACTH analogs. To study which amino acids might be important in establishing the binding between peptide hormones and their receptors, Hofmann and his group began a systematic evaluation of the contributions each amino acid in the S-Peptide molecule made to the binding with S-Protein. The ability of synthetic analogs of S-Peptide to activate S-Protein correlated well with those of synthetic ACTH analogs to elicit hormonal activity: 1) only a portion of the S-Peptide chain was essential for re-establishing full activity Hofmann, K., Finn, F.

Once it was established that peptide hormone receptors resided on the plasma membrane of cells, direct studies of the activity of ACTH derivatives that had so long eluded researchers finally became a reality. Hofmann and his colleagues isolated plasma membranes from beef adrenalsFinn, F. M. Widnell, C. C. and Hofmann, K.

Chem. 247 5695-5702 1972. and were able to conduct structure-activity studies with synthetic analogs of ACTH. Importantly they found that substituting Phenylalanine for theTryptophan residue in position 9 produced a peptide that bound to the ACTH receptor without activating it, i.e. and ACTH antagonist.Hofmann, K., Wingender, W. and Finn, F.

Return to Biotin receptor isolation Hofmann came full circle to his early work on biotin when he attached this vitamin to insulin. He spent a sabbatical leave in Aachen in Helmut Zahn's laboratory to learn techniques for modifying insulinHofmann, K., Finn, F. M., Friesen, H-J., Diaconescu, C. and Zahn, H. Biotinylinsulins as potential tools for receptor studies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 74 2697-2700 1977.). Using this information, he was able to chemically attach biotin to one of the three Lys residues of the insulin chains, thus producing an insulin that would bind to columns of avidin-Sepharose. The biotinyl-insulin receptor complex could then be displaced by biotin. With this tool, Hofmann and his coworkers successfully isolated a fully active insulin receptor.Finn, F. M., Titus, G., Horstman, D. and Hofmann, K. Avidin-biotin affinity chromatography: application to the isolation of human placental insulin receptor. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81 7328-32 1984. His final work was directed toward isolation of the ACTH receptor using the same approach used on the insulin receptor but by this time his health was in decline.

The invasion lasted until late 210 when the emperor became ill and died at Eboracum (York) on 4 February 211. The war started well for the Romans with Severus managing to quickly reach the Antonine Wall, but when Severus pushed north into the highlands he became bogged down in a guerrilla war and he was never able to fully subjugate Caledonia. He reoccupied many forts built by Agricola over 100 years earlier, following the Battle of Mons Graupius, and crippled the ability of the Caledonians to raid Roman Britain. The invasion was abandoned by Severus' son Caracalla and Roman forces once again withdrew to Hadrian's Wall.  Background  The cause of Severus' invasion of Caledonia (modern day Scotland) was a massive increase in raids and attacks on Roman Britain. This was possible because in 195 Clodius Albinus, the Roman Governor of Britain, had led most of the British legions into Gaul during his revolt against Severus. Severus had sent them back to their posts after defeating Albinus, but they had suffered large casualties at the Battle of Lugdunum. This left Hadrian's Wall undermanned and made it easy for the Caledonians to raid into Roman Britain. The Caledonians were also able to gather more men for these raids than before as there is evidence of increased cooperation among the different northern tribes.  Invasion of Caledonia  In 208 Severus arrived in Britain with around 40,000 men and marched north to Hadrian's Wall. Once at Hadrian's Wall Severus initiated a massive rebuilding project which finally made the whole wall into stone (before the western portion had been mostly turf and timber); this led to later Romans calling Hadrian's Wall the Severan Wall. After starting the project Severus marched north and occupied all the land between Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall. After completing the occupation Severus began another reconstruction project but this time on the Antonine Wall. In 209 Severus led his army north into the highlands and roughly marched the same way Agricola had invaded over 100 years before. Severus suffered heavy casualties due to the guerrilla tactics used by the Caledonians. Because of this Severus began a plan of holding down all the territory he could by the reoccupation of many of Agricola's old forts and devastating all the territory he couldn't. This led to many of the tribes attempting to reach a peace agreement with Severus because of fear of extinction through Roman genocide. Peace talks failed and it looked as if the war would continue until all the tribes had submitted to Rome or been exterminated. In early 210 Severus' son Caracalla led a punitive expedition north of the Antonine wall with the intention of killing everyone he came across and looting and burning everything of value. The plan was for Severus to follow his son's army and permanently occupy all of Caledonia. In 210 Severus became ill and went to York to rest and recover. He kept getting worse until 4 February 211 when he died. Caracalla then called off the war against the Caledonians and headed back to Rome to consolidate his power. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.  Cassius Dio's account of the invasion  \\"Severus, accordingly, desiring to subjugate the whole of it, invaded Caledonia. But as he advanced through the country he experienced countless hardships in cutting down the forests, levelling the heights, filling up the swamps, and bridging the rivers; but he fought no battle and beheld no enemy in battle array. The enemy purposely put sheep and cattle in front of the soldiers for them to seize, in order that they might be lured on still further until they were worn out; for in fact the water caused great suffering to the Romans, and when they became scattered, they would be attacked. Then, unable to walk, they would be slain by their own men, in order to avoid capture, so that a full fifty thousand died. But Severus did not desist until he approached the extremity of the island. Here he observed most accurately the variation of the sun's motion and the length of the days and the nights in summer and winter respectively. Having thus been conveyed through practically the whole of the hostile country (for he actually was conveyed in a covered litter most of the way, on account of his infirmity), he returned to the friendly portion, after he had forced the Britons to come to terms, on the condition that they should abandon a large part of their territory.\\"[38]  Legacy  Although Caracalla withdrew from all the territory taken during the war, the latter did have some practical benefits for the Romans. These include the rebuilding of Hadrian's Wall which once again became the border of Roman Britain. The war also led to the reinforcing of the British frontier, which had been in dire need of reinforcements, and to the weakening of the various Caledonian tribes. It would take many years for them to recover their strength and begin raiding in strength.

The powerhouse and 4-track carhouse were located at Hallville, as was a trolley park called Lincoln Park. History The company was first chartered on May 11, 1903 as the Norwich, Mystic & Westerly Street Railway Company. The name was changed to the Norwich & Westerly Railway Company on December 12, 1905 after the Groton and Stonington Street Railway's Old Mystic branch negated the need for a N&W; branch to Mystic. Construction started early in 1906 and the first cars ran between Norwich and Hallville on August 18, 1906, and as far as North Stonington by August 30. The Westerly and Connecticut Railway (wholly owned by the Norwich & Westerly) was chartered in Rhode Island on March 13, 1906 and the first Norwich-Westerly through cars ran on November 12, 1906. The complete trolley line was estimated to cost $500,000. 1907 wreck. #2 is on the right and #1 in the middle. The line's only major accident occurred on August 1, 1907, when passenger car #2 and freight motor #1 collided at Avery's Crossing in North Stonington. Passengers Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Gardiner were killed along #2's motorman, George H. Lucier. Damage claims against the line exceeded $4,000. By the time of its acquisition by the Shore Line Electric Railway in 1916, the Norwich & Westerly Traction Company operated 59.08 miles of lines. These included the Norwich & Westerly system proper, the Pawcatuck Valley Street Railway, the Ashaway and Westerly Railway, and the Groton & Stonington Street Railway. Route 2 opened in 1919, providing the first competition to the line. Due to rapidly declining ridership, service on the line ended on December 31, 1922. The rails were ripped up in 1924. Construction The line was constructed to high-speed interurban standards, rather than simple street- running track like most other trolley lines in New England. A Street Railway Journal article from April 13, 1907 reported: > As the line was built primarily for high speed operation, curves and grades > are few in number. All curves have the outer rail elevated, according to > standard steam railroad practice for passenger train speeds. The maximum > grade is 4.5 per cent. There are many cuts and fills on the line, some of > the former being through rock. This disadvantage was balanced in one way, as > it enabled the company to use a great deal of rock ballast. A trolley stopped at North Stonington Except for short street-running sections near the terminals in Norwich and Westerly, the line was built on a private right-of-way with relatively few grade crossings. Sixty-five percent of the line was straight. Bridges were built over the numerous small streams on the route, as well as the State Line Bridge over the Pawcatuck River at White Rock. From Franklin Square in Norwich, the tracks ran down Main Street, then turned south onto the dedicated right-of-way. The line skirted Laurel Hill Road (now Route 12) at Norwich State Hospital, then ran parallel to Poquetanuck Road (now Route 2A) to Hallville. From there the line followed Route 2 closely into North Stonington, where the station was located at Main Street and Rocky Hollow Road. The line continued into Pawcatuck, where it veered east across the State Line Bridge and into White Rock, Rhode Island. After crossing Pierce Street in Westerly on a trestle, cars rejoined street traffic at the corner of West and Pleasant Streets. From there, they followed West Street on a bridge over the mainline rail tracks and onto Railroad Avenue to Westerly station, then on Pawcatuck Valley Street Railway trackage on Canal, High, and Broad streets to Dixon House Square and Westerly Public Library. A short spur ran from the main line around the south side of Norwich State Hospital to the Fort Point railroad station on the Norwich and Worcester Railroad, which was then controlled by the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. The Hallville powerhouse produced 16kV three-phase power, which was converted into 370V power for trolley motors at several locations, including a substation in White Rock north of Westerly. Operations Car #8 photographed with her crew Equipment consisted of eight passenger trolley cars (semi- convertibles #2,4,6,8 and closed cars #3,5,7,9) and a line car. One motor freight car (#1) and 25 freight trailers were used for freight operations, which included hauling coal to the powerhouse, Norwich State Hospital, and other customers along the trolley line. The freight cars also hauled quartz from the quarry on Lantern Hill. Although express cars could makes the Norwich-to-Westerly run in just 45 minutes, a normal run was 70 minutes. Service operated as frequently as 30-minute headways. Fares started at 35 cents, divided into 7 fare zones of a nickel each. The Norwich & Westerly connected at both ends with other streetcar companies. At Norwich, the Norwich Street Railway of the Connecticut Company ran local routes, and lines connected Norwich to New London, Willimantic, and Putnam. At Westerly, many cars continued through on the Pawcatuck Valley Street Railway to Watch Hill or Pleasant View, and connections were available to Ashaway and Groton.\\"Trolley Trips Through New England\\". Trolley Press, 1916. Riders took the trolley for several different purposes. During the summer, many residents would take through cars to the beaches at Watch Hill and Pleasant View. High school students rode the line from in Preston to Wheeler High School. The trolley park at Hallville, Lincoln Park, was open from 1908 to 1911. Remains and reuse Bridge over Assekonk Brook behind Wheeler High School in North Stonington The majority of the private right-of-way, totaling 21.02 miles including passing sidings, still exists and is visible on satellite maps. Only at Foxwoods Casino has it been significantly built over; the main entrance road - Trolley Line Boulevard - stands instead. In other places, including Norwich State Hospital and Pawcatuck, the right-of-way is no longer visible where fields and lawns have been plowed. A concrete arch bridge remains in place over Assekonk Brook behind Wheeler High School in North Stonington, and several other bridge abutments remain along the route. Some sections of the State Line Bridge still carry a sidewalk and a pipeline over the Pawcatuck River, although the highway section of the bridge was replaced around 1994. The Hallville powerhouse no longer exists, but the adjacent carhouse now belongs to the Connecticut Brass Company. Much of the right-of-way has been used for transmission lines since at least the 1940s, which are now owned by Connecticut Light and Power. Those sections, from Lincoln Park Road in Hallville to Mains Crossing in North Stonington, are relatively well- preserved, and old railroad spikes can occasionally be found. During the 2011 Halloween nor'easter, a tree on the lines caused significant outages. During the 1990s, when Foxwoods was being built, the right-of-way was considered for use as a light rail line or busway to reduce traffic on Route 2. (abstract) However, no transit system was built, and instead sections of Route 2 were widened.

Established in 1901, the university is a specialist provider of higher education for the agricultural and rural sector. The university provides more than 50 foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes to students from over 30 countries. The university is set within a 550 hectare (1360 acre) working farm.  History  The university's main building\\"Harper Adams College\\", which would become the University, was founded in 1901. Its first Principal was Headworth Foulkes (1901‚Äì1922). Thomas Harper Adams, a wealthy Shropshire gentleman farmer, died in 1892, bequeathing the estate with was the original foundation. The College had just six students to begin with. In 1909 a specialist poultry husbandry was created. During the First World War, Harper Adams remained open, and in 1915 the first women were admitted into the College on wartime farm courses. Harper Adams was the first institute to do so, and in 1916 women were admitted as full-time students onto a wide variety of courses. Approximately, 200 staff and former students served during the war and 40 are known to have died as a result. In 2015, 10 additional names were added to the university's memorial board, after previously unrecorded alumni were also discovered to been killed in action. A board in the Old Library listing the names of those killed was dedicated in March 2015, crafted by Peter Nunn of the university's estate department, whilst a new memorial garden was also created outside the library. The agricultural depression of the 1920s onward led to a drop in student numbers. In 1922, Charles Crowther (1922‚Äì1944) became Principal and efforts were taken to ensure the College stayed open. The National Institute of Poultry Husbandry opened in 1926, bringing with it to Harper a high profile in areas of teaching and research. The College managed to stay open during the Second World War, and in 1939 the first girls arrived at the College. Bill Price (1946‚Äì1962) become Principal in 1946 and student numbers steadily rose to 222. The Jubilee Hostel was opened in 1951. Reginald Kenny became Principal in 1962 until 1977. In 1964, the funding of the College was passed from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Department of Education and Science. The first Higher National Diploma students were enrolled in 1969. Tony Harris was later appointed Principal in 1977 until 1994. Degree courses were first introduced at Harper Adams in 1981. The university was one of the first institutions to introduce a BSc. sandwich course. The CNAA granted Harper Adams the authority to validate its own courses. In 1985, the science building was opened by The Princess Margaret. A wintertime view from the university's west lawn. Student numbers passed 1000 for the first time in 1991. In 1994, three new student residences were opened. Professor Wynn Jones became Principal in 1996, and later that year the Privy Council granted the university degree awarding powers. In 1998, Harper Adams gained the title of University College. In 2004, Harper Adams was awarded ¬£2.1 million in funding to develop its work with rural businesses. Harper Adams gained the power to award research degrees in 2006 and shortly after, a new Biomass Hall was opened. Dr David Llewellyn was appointed Principal in 2009.

Masur in 1951. The story is written in the first person and follows the lawyer Scott Jordan as he investigates several murders related to a high-stakes lawsuit between two Broadway producers.Masur, Harold Q. You Can't Live Forever. Simon and Schuster, 1951. Plot Joshua Wilde, a theatre producer, attempts to sue his former partner Nicholas Creel, alleging that Creel concealed a promising script until after the company's split. Wilde alleged that Creel had hidden the script in order to be the play's sole producer, gaining a larger share of the profits. Scott Jordan, who represents Wilde in the suit, finds a dead body in Creel's apartment. Creel returns to find Jordan alone in his apartment with the body, calls the police, and furiously accuses him of the apparent murder. Jordan protests that he was let in by a brunette, but that he did not know her name; she had disappeared before Creel had returned. Jordan is arrested and later released when accusers can produce no motive or evidence that Jordan ever met the deceased. Creel drops the charges of breaking and entering after his wife, Hildegard, testifies that Creel was having an affair with a small brunette meeting Jordan's description, lending credibility to Jordan's testimony that he was let in rather than forcing entry. The body in Creel's apartment remained unexplained; Creel was naturally the first suspect, but a witness, Julian St George (Hildegard's uncle), had brought him straight to his apartment from his office, where he had been all day, and his secretary was able to corroborate his alibi. Scott resumes his search for the author of the script in order to confirm the date of submission, thereby proving his client's case that Creel had intentionally hidden it from his partner. Scott discovers that the real author died before the script was produced, yet an \\"author\\" continues to receive royalty checks, addressed to Willard Thorne, a fabricated name. Scott begins to suspect that Creel, impersonating the author, was receiving royalty checks as well as revenues from the produced play. Gladys, Creel's former secretary who tells Scott the true identity of the author, is found strangled the day after he speaks with her, and Scott begins to fear for his own life. Scott and Lieutenant John Nola, a police detective, although unable to find a solid link between Creel and the murders acknowledge that the circumstances seem to indicate his guilt, and they decide to question him, hoping to back him into a corner. When they arrive, they find Creel dead, stabbed with a knife belonging to Hildegard; Hildegard said that the knife had been stolen the night before. The knife was an heirloom passed down to Hildegard from her uncle Julian. Scott notices that the hilt opens, revealing a hollow tube and remembers a photograph found in Creel's apartment curled like a scroll to a roll the width of a pencil. The image is a wedding photograph of Julian and Eva St George, and Scott notices that the photo shows Julian to be definitely shorter than Eva, whereas the Julian he knows is very tall. Julian St George was receiving substantial annuity payments every month, and since his father had set up the policy for him long before he was married, upon Julian's death, the policy would be terminated, and his wife Eva would no longer receive anything. Scott, upon seeing the height discrepancy, realizes that the real Julian St George had died years ago, but to continue receiving the annuity, Eva had gotten an impersonator, someone who looked exactly like Julian except for the unfortunate difference in height. Creel had discovered the photograph concealed in his wife's knife heirloom and was blackmailing the St Georges, extorting thousands of dollars and forcing them to receive checks as Willard Thorne in order to give him the money once the checks were cashed. In an effort to destroy the one piece of evidence remaining of the former Julian St George, the impersonator had stolen the knife. Wanting to remove the remaining witness to their scheme, he had killed Nicholas Creel. When Scott confronts the St Georges with his theory, the impersonator draws a gun, planning to kill Scott as well. Lieutenant Nola enters just in time to save Scott, starting a gunfight in which the impersonator is shot and killed.

His banking career began in the 1970s in Europe, and he is currently the CEO of Galileo Global Advisors, a New York-based investment bank catering to emerging markets. He is a notable member of the Belgian diaspora, due to his influence in the world of international finance. He is a frequent public speaker and an op-ed contributor to the Huffington Post. Early life Born in 1945 in Belgium, Georges Ugeux's upbringing was both Walloon and Flemish . In the late 1960s he studied at Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, graduating in Economics and Doctor of Law. He told newspaper Le Soir in 1995 that, at that time, he had been deeply troubled by the language feud known as Walen Buiten, and, consequently, he embraced the European ideal. Career Georges Ugeux began his financial career in 1970 at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Banque, headquartered in Brussels, rising to the position of head of the investment banking and trust division. In 1985, he served as Managing Director of Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions in London. In 1988, he was appointed Group Finance Director at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique. In 1992, he became President and Managing Director of Kidder, Peabody & Co. for Europe. In this role, he advises governments on privatization programs. He began serving as President of the European Investment Fund in June 1994. In 1995, he takes the helm of an organization, under the authority of Belgium's ministry of finance, that, as part of a privatization program that began in 1992, makes an inventory of government assets to be sold. Georges Ugeux joined the New York Stock Exchange in September 1996, as Group Executive Vice President, International & Research, a financial news outlet labeling him \\"the face of the New York Stock Exchange outside of the United States\\". In 2003, he resigned amidst the NYSE compensation controversy. He claimed it was a coincidence because he had planned his departure in order to start a business, and defended his record as follows : \\"the NYSE listed 300 non-U.S. companies with a value of $2.7 trillion\\". In 2003, Georges Ugeux founded an investment banking advisory firm, Galileo Global Advisors, and, since then, has been its CEO. The company caters primarily, but not exclusively, to Asian clients, such as the Guangzhou municipality.http://www.galileoglobaladvisors.com/CompanyInformation/Partnerships/China.aspx In the wake of the 2009 legal fallout of Fortis, a Belgian financial services conglomerate, Georges Ugeux pursued the chairmanship of its board, but rapidly abandoned due to a deadlock in the negotiations between the different parties. In 2011, Georges Ugeux' company joined the Institute of International Finance, which he doesn't see as banking lobby, and he was involved in the negotiations on Greece's debt restructuring, a saga that crystallized tensions in the Euro zone. Writing Georges Ugeux is a regular blog author for the Huffington Post and the author of a Le Monde blog, D√©mystifier la Finance, Ethiques et March√©s. In the second half of 2011, his blog rose to the heights of popularity, in its category,http://labs.ebuzzing.fr/top- blogs/source/finance.blog.lemonde.fr-O9OA/stats while its coverage focused on Greece's debt restructuring, the negotiations of which Georges Ugeux was privy to (see section on Career), and its deleterious effects on the eurozone. Sometimes, his writing contains vitriolic rhetoric: \\"In his Le Monde blog, Georges Ugeux asks if the French president is in reality the president of the French banks\\", reported Eurointelligence in October 2011. Financial crisis Georges Ugeux, who had promoted the NYSE's self-regulatory organization internationally as a senior official of the exchange, later deplored the \\"magistral failure\\" brought upon by the myth of auto-regulation in the financial sector, in 2009. This view is developed in a book published in 2010, , available in Dutch, English (2011) and French. Eurozone debt crisis Georges Ugeux stands in stark opposition to the claim of economists such as Paul Krugman (whom he accuses of making bold predictions out of concern for his own image) that Greece leaving the Eurozone, a topical issue in the middle of 2012, would have a net benefit for the country's economy. His reasoning is that the gains from a devaluation of the Greek drachma would be offset by the corresponding increase in the relative value of the outstanding debt in Euro (issued before the currency switch), whether public of private.

His primary area of expertise was medieval English law and the relationship between royal and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Graves was born in Philadelphia, where he attended the Penn Charter School and Haverford College. At Haverford, he studied with the eminent medievalist W. E. Lunt, who taught courses on English constitutional history and did pioneering research on papal financial records. Graves would maintain a close working relationship with Lunt for many years until the latter's death in 1956. Following graduation from Haverford, Graves continued on to Harvard where he completed a Ph.D under the supervision of Charles Homer Haskins. From 1927 until his retirement in 1969, Graves taught history at Hamilton College in central New York state. His scholarship focused on a few select issues in English legal history, particularly the relationship between the Crown and ecclesiastical courts, including the papal rota. Later, he would see to completion the massive two-volume work begun by his mentor Lunt on papal finances in England.William E. Lunt, with Edgar B. Graves, The Financial Relations of the Papacy with England, vol. 2.

The brotherhoods attempted to stem the state- supported Catholic missionary activities by publishing books in the Cyrillic script and financing a net of brotherhood schools which offered education in the Ruthenian language.Russian Humanitarian Encyclopaedia The famous Kiev Mohyla Academy grew out of one such school under the umbrella of the Brotherhood Monastery in Kiev.

One night, Manoj comes to Rayudu with a bloodied nose and claims that he saw a ghost which tried to kill him and warned him about selling the Mahal. Rayudu reveals that the ghost might be his dead father, Rudramaneni Narsimha Rayudu (Nandamuri Balakrishna) and explains the history of Gandharva Mahal to Manoj. Gandhrva Mahal has been with the Rudramaneni family for centuries and was passed on to Narasimha Rayudu (Nandamuri Balakrishna), a Zamindar who is well respected in the village. He lives with his wife (Panchi Bora) and sister Jagadamba (Simer Motiani). He marries his sister Jagadamba to Phanindra Bhoopati (Sonu Sood). Few days after the marriage, Bhoopati insults Narsimha Rayudu and asks him to give their share in the family property. Deeply hurt by the incident, Narsimha Rayudu gives half of everything he owns including the Gandharva Mahal to his sister and walks out of the house. He also gives hundred acres of land to Seshayya (Bhanu Chander), his trusted employee and friend. It is later revealed that Bhoopati married Jagadamba only for the money and wants to marry his sweetheart Amrutha Valli (Lakshmi Manchu). Amrutha doesn't want to marry Bhoopathi since he already has a wife. Consequently, Bhoopathi kills Jagadamba and makes it look like a suicide. On hearing the news, Narasimha Rayudu is devastated. Only a week after Jagadamba's death, Bhoopathi tries to marry Amrutha in the Gandhrva Mahal. Narasimha Rayudu, angered by Bhoopathi's actions, confronts him. Bhoopathi gets into a fight with Narasimha Rayudu and stabs him with a sword. He also reveals to Amrutha and the dying Narasimha Rayudu that he was the one who murdered Jagadamba. In anger, Narasimha Rayudu kills Bhoopathi and dies in the Mahal. Amrutha, saddened by the events, blames herself for the whole incident and eventually turns into a beggar. In the present, Gandharva Mahal is readied for the marriage of Visalakshi. The bridegroom Rishi (Richard Rishi) and his family arrive for the wedding. It is revealed that Rishi's uncle Bujji (Sai Kumar) wants to take the palace and convert it into a hotel. Later that night, Bujji sees Narasimha Rayudu's ghost and gets scared. Bujji seeks the help of a Mantrik (Ajay) who reveals that the house is indeed haunted by the souls of Bhoopati and Narasimha Rayudu. He captures the violent soul of Bhoopathi and traps it in a bottle. It is also revealed that Manoj is Seshayya's grandson and was sent by his mother Suguna (Suhasini Maniratnam), Seshayya's daughter to help Rayudu and his family. Manoj reveals to Jagadha that he was never attacked by a ghost and tells her it was part of his plan to avoid giving the Mahal as dowry. He also reveals that it was not a ghost but him that scared Bujji. Bujji overhears the conversation and is angered. Believing that the Mantrik too was a fraud, in anger he breaks the bottle in which the Mantrik captured Bhoopati's soul. Now freed, Bhoopathi's soul enters Rishi's body and tries to kill the family. Narasimha Rayudu's soul enters Manoj's body and tries to stop Bhoopathi. Mantrik brings Amrutha Valli to stop Bhoopathi. Amrutha Valli lies to Bhoopathi that she got married and kills herself to stop him. In the end, Visalakshi marries Rishi and Manoj marries Jagadha. Manoj also sees the ghost of Narsimha Rayudu sitting on a chair and smoking a cigar, indicating that he would forever protect the Mahal.

Jeevi from Idlebrain gave 3.25 of 5.0 rating and said \\"UKUP is a special film for two reasons. One is that it introduces a big star like Bala Krishna in a vital role. If big stars accept story oriented films and act as per demand of the role instead of looking for equal screen space, it‚Äôs good for the industry. The second reason is that the producer has passionately invested on the project though it‚Äôs a story oriented film with a bit of experimentation.

Protests took place across the country, including in the cities of Kano, Surulere, Ojota ( -part of metropolitan Lagos ), Abuja, Minna, and at the Nigerian High Commission in London. The protests have been characterised by civil disobedience, civil resistance, strike actions, demonstrations and online activism. The use of social media services such as Twitter and Facebook has been a prominent feature. Through 2012, Occupy Nigeria continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. Background Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer, but still imports refined petrol. The country produces about 2.4 million barrels of crude oil daily which is exported to be refined abroad; however due to years of corruption-fueled neglect the domestic refineries are inoperative. As a consequence, Nigeria imports 70% of its gasoline (about 250,000bpd of petroleum products) into the country for sale to its citizens. The price of petrol has increased from 65 naira ($0.40; ¬£0.26) per litre to at least 141 naira in filling stations and from 100 naira to at least 200 naira on the black market, from which many Nigerians buy their fuel. With the majority of Nigerians living on less than $2 per day, cheap petrol is viewed by many Nigerians as the only tangible benefit they receive from the state, hence the widespread disapproval. In addition, the economy is heavily reliant on crude oil (amongst other reasons, due to absence of essential infrastructure and services such as constant electricity). A consequence of this is that other seemingly unrelated items are tied to the price of fuel as has occurred from previous price hikes. Due to the absence of stable electricity, gasoline generators are a common energy alternative for small businesses and residences. The removal of the subsidy took effect from Sunday, 1 January 2012 as announced by the Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency, PPPRA Reginald Stanley. Protests Protesters shut petrol stations and formed human barriers along motorways. Nigeria's main trade unions have also announced an indefinite strike and mass demonstrations from Monday, 9 January 2012 unless the removal of a fuel subsidy is reversed. \\"We have the total backing of all Nigerian workers on this strike and mass protest,\\" the Nigeria Labour Congress's Chris Uyot told the BBC. Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria Lamido Sanusi told the BBC the subsidy (which he said cost the government about $8bn last year) was \\"unsustainable\\". Several previous governments have tried to remove the subsidy but have backed down in the face of widespread public protests and reduced it instead. Casualties Muyideen Mustapha, 23, was reportedly the first person to be killed during the nationwide protests over the lifting of petrol subsidies. He was reportedly shot by the Nigerian Police Force in Ilorin, Kwara State on 3 January 2012. The Police denied the report saying that he had been stabbed by other protestors for not joining in the protest. Muyideen was buried on Wednesday 4 January 2012, according to Islamic rites. There have been further reports of one to three people being killed by clashes between police and protesters on 9 January. On 9 January, a Divisional Police Officer attached to the Lagos State Command, shot and killed a young man, Ademola Aderinde at Ogba during the protests in Lagos. The officer was arrested on the order of the Commissioner of Police and was expected to be charged with murder following an investigation. Abuja & London protests The Occupy Nigeria Movement plans another protest to hold at Eagle Square, Abuja for Friday, 6 January 2012 while another one hold simultaneous at the Nigerian Embassy in London. However, leaks from security agencies report of an order issued by the Government of Nigeria to the Mobile Police, advising them that the best way to stop the protests was to kill at least one of the protesters.  Minna Riot  On the third day of the protests, a crowd of youths went on the rampage, setting fire to buildings and cars in the Niger State capital. Hundreds of rioters set fire to government and political party offices and also targeted the homes of local politicians. An office building belonging to former Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida was among those attacked. One policeman was killed in Minna when an electoral commission building was attacked. International protests Occupy Nigeria protesters in New York City The Occupy Nigeria protests have also occurred in other countries to show solidarity with what the plight of Nigerians back home. The first one was held at the Nigerian High Commission in London on 6 January 2012, followed by another at the World bank complex in Washington D.C. on 9 January. 2012. Other countries like Belgium (-in Brussels its capital), and South Africa joined the protests and occupied the Nigerian embassy in their countries in the second week of January 2012 NLC/TUC On Thursday, 5 January 2012, the Nigeria Labour Congress issued an ultimatum to the Federal Government promising to halt the economy of the country by Monday, 9 January 2012. \\"We are shutting down the Nigerian airspace to local and international flights from Sunday night\\" said Denja Yakub of NLC. \\"If a revolution will solve our problems, why not, what is going on already shows that our people are prepared for a revolution. But we will not ask for a revolution that will bring back the military, they are a part of the problem.\\" he added Government reaction Following the emergency meeting of the Federal Executive Council, in Abuja, the Minister of Information, Mr. Labaran Maku, told newsmen the government was not oblivious of the pains inflicted by Nigerians as a result of the new policy. In order to ameliorate those pains, he said the government had commenced a ‚Äòmassive mass transit scheme‚Äô aimed at cushioning the effects of the subsidy removal on transportation. 1600 diesel-powered mass transit vehicles, he claimed, would be distributed. Curiously missing at the pivotal meeting were two controversial senior officials and pillars of the new policy: Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and Petroleum Resources Minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is quoted as having said that she'll resign if the presidency goes back on its decision to remove the subsidy. Media Channels Television and Galaxy Television, two local mediahouses in Lagos, covered the Lagos protests on 3 January 2012. There was also a report on the march in the Daily Times of Nigeria. In addition, Facebook group pages were created to spur Nigerians globally against the fuel- subsidy removal regime. One of them (called \\"Nationwide Anti-Fuel Subsidy Removal: Strategies & Protests\\") was created on 2 January 2012 and had over 20,000 members by 9 January 2012. Student websites in universities and blogs are reporting the Occupy Nigeria Protests and student representatives are sending live pictures of ongoing protests. Twitter was also used as a connecting platform for the protesters. The 2012 documentary Fuelling Poverty by Ishaya Bako was based on some of the events that occurred during the fuel subsidy crisis. It was banned by the Federal government of Nigeria for being \\"highly provocative and likely to incite or encourage public disorder and undermine national security.\\". It went on to win category Best Documentary at the 2013 Africa Movie Academy Awards. and was praised by many Human Right activists and organisations.

The prototype was built that October and appeared, unflown, at the Paris Air Show of 1983. It flew for the first time on 27 April 1984. The GY-120 had an aluminium alloy tube structure, stressed to FAR 23 standard. Its parasol wing was unswept and of constant chord, carrying half span ailerons. The wing was supported from below by a fore and aft pair of inverted V-form struts from the upper fuselage longerons to its centreline. These struts also supported a longitudinal inverted V kingpost to which landing wires were attached. Flying wires braced the wing from below to the lower fuselage. The fuselage was flat sided, the fin and rudder straight edged. The leading edge of the fin was swept and the deep, almost rectangular rudder reached down between the elevators, mounted on the tailplane at the top of the fuselage, to the keel. Two seats in tandem were placed below the wing in a continuous open cockpit. The GY-120 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with the mainwheels on half axles and radius arms mounted on the fuselage centreline and near vertical rubber compression legs fixed to the fuselage sides. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was coil sprung.

His death at the hands of an undercover British Army unit is one of the few from the alleged shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland to have involved a loyalist victim. Life Robinson was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland to Rab and Margaret Robinson, and brought up a Protestant on Disraeli Street in the staunchly loyalist Woodvale district of the Shankill Road. It is not known when he became a member of the local Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). He held the rank of volunteer in its \\"B Company\\", 1st Battalion Belfast Brigade. By the time of his death he had moved to Forthriver Crescent in the Glencairn estate, an area immediately northwest of Woodvale.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 1178 Death On 2 September 1989, Robinson and fellow UVF member Davy McCullough were travelling on a motorbike, with Robinson as the passenger armed with a gun, in Belfast's Crumlin Road, close to the Irish nationalist area of Ardoyne. Upon seeing Paddy McKenna, a catholic civilian, walking along the street, Robinson opened fire, hitting McKenna a total of 11 times and killing him. Unbeknownst to the two UVF members, an undercover British Army unit, linked to the Special Air Service, was in the area. Giving chase in a Vauxhall Astra car and a Fiat, the soldiers rammed the motorbike, forcing both men off the road.

Robinson was a member of the 'Old Boyne Heroes' lodge of the Orange Order, and several members wearing their sashes flanked the coffin. The cortege then met up with Margaret Robinson's funeral as it left her home in Crimea Street. A lorry carrying floral tributes led the cortege. Both mother and son were buried in Roselawn Cemetery.

Cuttance initially commanded the 5th Rate Pearl (24 guns) 1651‚Äì2, but then took a prominent role in the first Dutch War (1652-4) when, in August 1652, he fought at the Battle of Plymouth under Sir George Ayscue. In 1653, he commanded the 4th Rate Sussex (46 guns) and fought at the Battle of Portland. At the Battle of the Gabbard, he was in Samuel Howett's division. He was also likely at the Battle of Scheveningen. Cuttance sailed on the Tunis expedition in 1655, then commanded the 3rd Rate Langport.

In 1881 he obtained a degree in natural sciences at Marseille, followed by his doctorate of sciences (1884) at Paris with a thesis on ascidians of coastal Provence. From 1885 he worked as a lecturer at the faculty of sciences in Toulouse, where in 1892 he became a professor. During the previous year (1891), he earned a doctorate in medicine. In 1910 he succeeded L√©on Vaillant (1834‚Äì1914) as chair of zoology (reptiles and fish) at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, a position he would hold until 1937.

IFC News No. 49, March 2009 - The Museum national d'Histoire naturelle (biography in French) Roule's early research dealt largely with invertebrates. Later his focus turned to ichthyology, of which he had the opportunity to take inventory of large collections of marine specimens. He analyzed collections gathered from Prince Albert I of Monaco, as well as specimens obtained from the Antarctic expeditions of Jean-Baptiste Charcot (1867‚Äì1936). Roule was the first scientist to describe Grimaldichthys profundissimus, a fish species found at a depth of over six kilometers.

The Devon Heritage Centre in Exeter is the main archive. It has a branch office, the North Devon Record Office in Barnstaple (established in 1988), which is the repository for records broadly relating to North Devon. Since 2014 the joint service has been run by the South West Heritage Trust under the name of the Devon Archives and Local Studies Service. In addition, there is the Plymouth and West Devon Record Office in Plymouth, run since 1998 as an independent archive service by Plymouth City Council, which hold records relevant to the area indicated by its name. This archive is planned to move into the new Plymouth History Centre in spring 2020. Devon Heritage Centre The Devon Heritage Centre (DHC) is the successor to the Devon Record Office (DRO) that was established by Devon County Council in 1952. The DRO incorporated the Exeter City Record Office that had collected Devon's records since 1946, when it took over from the Exeter City Library, which had collected documents since the early 20th century. In 2005 the DRO moved into a specially-constructed building at Great Moor House, Sowton Business Park, Exeter. A restructuring of services led to the creation of the Devon Heritage Service in November 2011 with the aim of integrating the collections of the DRO and the Westcountry Studies Library, and from autumn 2012 the Westcountry Studies Library that had been housed in Exeter city centre, moved into Great Moor House which was renamed the Devon Heritage Centre. On 1 November 2014 Devon Heritage Services was transferred from the County Council to the management of the South West Heritage Trust (an independent charity, which also runs Somerset Archives and Local Studies), and was rebranded as the Devon Archives and Local Studies Service. Among the holdings of the DHC are the complete records of the Devon Quarter Sessions courts from 1592 until their abolition in 1971; this is the earliest uninterrupted series of such records in the country. Other holdings include the records of the city of Exeter from c.1100; the records of the Diocese of Exeter (which included Cornwall until 1875) from the 13th century; Anglican church records for the whole of Devon from the 16th century; and the records of many of the major Devon families.

Her work has been successfully presented internationally in institutions ‚Äì Instituto Valenciano de Arte Moderno, Spain, Musee de Grenoble, France, PS1-Moma, USA, French Institute New York, USA, among many others ‚Äì as well as galleries ‚Äì AC Project room, NY, Galerie Franck, Paris -. She has received a strong critical interest from prominent art historians and writers, such as Arthur Danto, Edmund White, Yannick Haenel, Julia Kristeva and Carter Ratcliff. Lopez-Huici's work is focused on the human body, constantly transgressing conventional canons of beauty. To accentuate the shadowy areas of the human adventure, she uses black and white photography marked with a pronounced grain and deep blacks. Her series Aviva, Dalila, and Holly show her passion for Rubenesque bodies. Her African series Adama & Omar and Kenekoubo Ogo√Øre reveal her interest for any kind of physical and sensual expression. The series Rebelles and Triumph deal with a group of voluptuous women asserting their majesty. Her series Priscille/Hecate (2009‚Äì2011), nude portraits of a handicapped model, affirms, in the tradition of Rodin, the true beauty and personality of the fragmented body. After photographing the naked body for many years, it was an unusual challenge to work with Shani Ha (2013‚Äì2016) and her wearable textile sculptures. Her images, as art critic David Cohen puts it, \\"convey a sense of the body as lived-in, actual and present.\\" Lopez-Huici, as Francis Marmande says \\"illuminates the model, gives her the strength to transgress what we see or what we do not see.\\" Connected to the incredible rich world of the free jazz improvisation, she records in depth many of the most talented musicians, publishing for example the series The flying hands of Cecil Taylor.  Intertwining life and work   Early Years  Ariane Lopez-Huici is born in Biarritz, France, in 1945 to Eugenio Lopez-Huici, a Basque-Chilean, and Evelyne Belly from Lorraine. Her great-aunt Eugenia Err√°zuriz was a patron of the arts, a friend of Stravinsky and Picasso, and the subject of a well-known portrait and series of drawings by Picasso. In 1970, after finishing art school in France and Italy Lopez-Huici becomes the assistant to Brazilian filmmaker Nelson Pereira dos Santos, widely regarded as the father of Brazil's Cinema Novo. At his side she learns lighting and photographic techniques. During these years, she also develops a long-term attachment to avant-garde cinema and all forms of artistic improvisation.  Statuary and abstraction  She married sculptor Alain Kirili in 1977. That same year, she had her first one-woman exhibition at Dartmouth College (New Hampshire). On her second trip to India in 1979, she visited and photographed the famous erotic temple of Khajuraho, creating the series Indian Ecstasy. The following year, she settled with Kirili in a loft on White Street in Tribeca, New York. At P.S.1 in New York, in 1983, she exhibited a series of photographs taken in Istanbul, entitled The Tombs of Suleiman the Magnificent. A couple of years later, in 1989, she created the series In Abstracto.  The model : an ongoing revelation  Aviva She met the dancer Daniel D. in 1989, who modelled for Solo Absolu, one of her most striking series, where she photographed a man masturbating. The following year, she participated in the group-show Fragments, Parts, Wholes : The body and culture at White Columns, New York, curated by Saul Ostrow, on the theme of the body, where she presented male eroticism. Following this exhibition, the critic Jeanne Siegel wrote an article about male sexuality seen by women artists and particularly explored Lopez-Huici's involvement in her practice as a photographer : \\"The experience approaches the cinematic, particularly when a number of single frames are seen together. Her participation, her watching while recording, is undoubtedly an erotic experience. She is an accomplice in an activity that is a fulfillment of desire.\\" Solo Absolu, the series on male masturbation, was exhibited in 1994 at the AC Project Room Gallery, Manhattan, USA. In conjunction with this show, \\"A Conversation Between Julia Kristeva and Ariane Lopez-Huici\\" was published, where the two artists discussed among other matters what it meant to be in a couple with another artist and the photographer's relationship to sexuality. To celebrate her fiftieth birthday and in solidarity with her models, Lopez-Huici placed herself before the camera, dancing naked in the 20 minutes film entitled TOAK- 1995. In 1999, she exhibited for the first time in Paris her Aviva series at the Galerie Frank. This series was crucial in Lopez-Huici's search for the transgressive body. Aviva, a beautiful large woman reclined or sat proudly on a bed. Arthur Danto wrote in the exhibition catalogue that \\"the paraphernalia underscores Aviva's identity as a model, someone who is there to be depicted, and not to represent anything ulterior. The poses too belong to the repertory of studio poses : she is not shown doing anything but pose, which of course goes with her nudity\\" and further \\"The photographistic setting is intended as a guarantor of the reality the photographs show : Aviva is the way we see her.\\" left During this show, Lopez-Huici encountered Dalila Khatir, a very important future model in her work. The following year, at FIAC, in Paris, Gallery Frank exhibited a collection of photographs of her favorite models: Aviva, Dalila, Mother and Son, Femme √† la Toilette, and a new model from New York, Bill Shannon, a paralyzed hip-hop dancer. In 2003, she travelled extensively in West Africa, photographing the African wrestlers Adama and Omar in Dakar, the Master of Ceremonies Keneboubo Ogo√Øre in Mali, and Les √âl√©gantes from Saint Louis in S√©n√©gal. These series inspired the following comment by her friend, the critic Edmund White in an essay about her work : \\"She is in search of images, not the tourist's snapshots (her eye is not that passive) but rather those pictures that contest her own being or confirm her darkest suspicions or brightest hopes about human nature.\\" The series of African wrestlers is presented later in 2005 at the Bowery Poetry Club in New York. In 2004 she had two one-person exhibitions in museums, one at the Mus√©e de Grenoble, France, and one at IVAM (Institut Valenci√† d'Art Modern), in Spain. Carter Ratcliff and Edmund White wrote for the respective catalogues. At the New York Studio School in 2007, Lopez-Huici showed a selection of her nudes, especially her most recent group series Rebelles and Triumph, with a catalogue written by Carter Ratcliff. The latter captured something very accurate about Lopez-Huici and her work when he said : \\" She is a photographer She is not afraid of flesh She is not in love with pure form. Nor with impure form, for she does not believe in simple dichotomies.\\" In 2008, the photographer and multimedia artist Marilia Destot made the \\"photographic\\" film The Body Close Up, a retrospective documentary which revealed the evolution and artistic challenges of Lopez-Huici's photography from abstract to figurative art to a jubilant celebration of the body. The film mixed the artist's photography and her verbal commentary with musical quotes from writers and musicians close to her work. It also showed, for the first time, the intimacy of a session in the studio with the artist and her models. This film had its first screening at the Maison Fran√ßaise of New York University the same year. Priscille In 2010 Lopez-Huici exhibited her series with a handicapped model, Priscille, in the joint exhibition Ariane Lopez-Huici and Marilia Destot : The Fragmented Body, at the French Institute Alliance Fran√ßaise in New York. Guy Sorman wrote in the text \\"Free Bodies\\" that accompanied the show, \\"Ariane's photos reveal to us, in all indiscretion, the degree to which we live in an era that represses bodies, even in the West, even as it pretends to liberate them\\" and she \\"authorizes us to gaze at Priscille, and to find her beautiful.\\" In 2012 she presented, at the New York University in France, a series of photographs she made with two important models, Dalila and Priscille. In an insightful text on Lopez-Huici's work written by the writer Yannick Haenel for the exhibition, he noted about her models : \\"Look at these women : they tear through the screen of convention, they are just not \\"right,\\" as one says in the U.S. Their solitude is a splendid combat : that of bodies that see themselves rising up, that breathe forward, smiling with their shoulders. Their backs breathe, their hair is thinking. Breathing and thinking ground a freedom for each irreducible body,\\" and specifically about Priscille : \\"For Priscille is not excluded from her body : everything in her proclaims this gracefully. Her body is calmly that of a warrior : it is desirable. It makes me want to say, transforming Rimbaud's discovery, the body is an other.\\" He concluded \\"To take pleasure [jouir] is to discover the attitude, the gesture, the method that disenchants existence; every instant that breaks with our programmed captivity becomes a victory : and even if the accidents of life have damaged your body, triumph remains possible, frightening, and sublime; it is affirmed here, in the black and white lightning flashes of Ariane Lopez-Huici.\\" 2013 Shani Ha In 2014, Ariane Lopez-Huici exhibited in Parcours Crois√©s a duo with Alain Kirili at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Caen in France. It was the first time they had had a show together and revealed a lifetime commitment to a shared artistic life. Ultimately, as the artist put it herself during a long dialogue with her friend, the philosopher Paul Audi, \\"In every one of my photographs it isn't the human being that is stripped bare but the humanity of the human being. ... It's that humanity (...) which calls to me and stimulates me.\\"  References   Exhibitions   Solo Exhibitions  * 2016 Art 3 Gallery, New York City * 2014 Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Caen, Caen, France * 2013 Hionas Gallery, New York City * 2012 NYU in France, Paris * 2010 French Institute ‚Äì Alliance Fran√ßaise, New York City * 2007 New York Studio School, New York City * 2005 Bowery Poetry Club, New York City * 2004 Institut d'Art Moderne de Valencia, IVAM, Valencia, Spain * 2004 Mus√©e de Grenoble, Grenoble, France * 2002 Ecole d'arts Plastiques, Chatellerault, France * 2000 Galerie Frank, Fiac, Paris * 1999 Galerie Frank, Paris * 1996 AC Project Room, New York * 1994 AC Project Room, New York * 1993 G√©rard Delsol & Laurent Innocenzi Gallery, Paris * 1992 Colt Gallery, Nice, France * 1988 Kunst Station Sant Peter, Cologne * 1988 Marina Urbach Gallery, New York * 1988 Philadelphia Museum of Judaica, Philadelphia, PA * 1984 Galerie Dominique March√®s, Chateauroux, France * 1983 Photography Center, Los Angeles * 1982 P.S.1, Long Island City, New York * 1982 New York University, La Maison Francaise, New York * 1980 Diane Brown Gallery, Washington, USA * 1978 Hal Bromm Gallery, New York * 1977 Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH  Group Exhibitions  * 2014 Body Conscious, curated by Emily L.

Numerous sluices have been built on the Hanami to protect the surrounding area from damage due to high tides and typhoons. History ≈åwada Drainage Pump Station viewed from Hanami River The Hanami River was developed as a canal in the 18th century to connect the Tone River to Tokyo Bay, control flooding in the Inbanuma marsh area, and facilitate the construction of new rice paddy areas in Shim≈çsa Province. The first attempt at building a canal was in 1724, but funds provided by the Tokugawa shogunate to the chief of Hirato Village, now part of Yachiyo, dried up and the project was abandoned. In 1844 final work on the canal was completed. Within two years shallow riverboats carried rice and sweet potatoes from the Tone River area to Kemigawa Harbor, and in turn returned fertilizer up the canal to agricultural areas in its upper reaches of the Hanami. Shipping along the Hanami River declined greatly by the end of the Tokugawa period due to the construction of roads along the river. The transport of sweet potatoes for starch production in the Kemigawa area continued, however, until 1952.

In that battle, the Serer strategy - led by their king Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof was to prevent the Muslim marabouts of Senegambia who came to launch jihad from entering Thiouthioune. Initially, the Muslims successfully broke the Serer lines and entered Thiouthioune. However, at the later stages of the battle, the Muslims were defeated by the Serer forces and Serer religion was installed. The leader of the Muslim army was decapitated in that battle under the orders of the Maad a Sinig. The sovereign of Thiouthioune in 1867 was Maad Amad Ngoneh Joof, commonly known as Amad Ngoneh Thiouthioune (Amad Ngoneh of Thiouthioune).

It is known as A Time for Everything in the United States. Its narrator is a man who has decided to write a book about the history of angels; his main source is a 16th-century treatise on angels by an Italian theologian, who encountered a pair of angels when he was young. The novel's Norwegian and British titles are a quotation from Ecclesiastes. Reception Salley Vickers reviewed the book for The Guardian, and wrote that it is \\"apparent from the start that here is a book that wants to be taken very seriously\\". Vickers wrote that \\"Knausgaard is at his best with finely observed natural description; he is also skilful with atmosphere\\", but the \\"theological and historical-sociological exegesis ... becomes a recurring, and increasingly distracting, strain. ... [I]t is hard not to wonder if [Knausg√•rd] began this book as an academic theological study and halfway through decided to transform it into a hybrid fiction by giving his commentaries\\". Vickers ended the review: \\"This is a book that will divide people. It may well become a cult novel.

Human rights activism Manoharan founded the NCDHR in 1998 with several other human rights activists, with the goal of raising visibility on the issue of caste discrimination. A total of 78 Dalit activists collaborated in forming NCDHR; they were upset that even after 50 years of independence of British rule, and a national constitution with statutes aimed at stopping caste discrimination, there was not a significant decrease in incidents relating to discrimination against Dalits across India and Asia.http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr2/aboutncdhr To combat these issues, the group decided on a three phase strategy. The first phase is to raise the visibility of specific events taking place in the region where Dalits have been discriminated against, mostly at the local, state and national levels. Phase 2 is to bring awareness of these Human Rights issues to the international stage. The third phase is to hold the Judiciary system accountable for enforcing the laws stipulated in the constitution. Recently the plight of the Dalit people has become more internationally known and confronted. In 2002, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination condemned caste discrimination. In December 2006 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stated that \\"‚Äòuntouchability‚Äô is not just social discrimination. It is a blot on humanity.\\". In 2009, a deceleration was made that discrimination against a group of people (Dalits) is a human rights violation was a huge success for Manoharan and the NCDHR. He also helped in the founding of the International Dalit Solidarity Network,http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/vincent_manoharan.html a group that fights caste discrimination on a global level. In 2007 the Manoharan and the NCDHR won the Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize for their work in the field of Human Rights.

Horsfall, Leading Plant Pathologist, 90; By Robert McG. Thomas Jr; Published: March 29, 1995 Horsfall was most noted for the discovery of several organic fungicides which changed the way crops' fungus diseases are treated worldwide. Prior to his discovery these diseases were treated either with heavy metals which were poisonous to humans or somewhat ineffective sulfur based compounds. The Horsfall-Barratt scale devised by him, and still in use, allows for the easy assessment of crop damage level based on the extent of leaf damaged by fungal or bacterial infections in the field on a 12-point scale. Horsfall was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. The New York Times called Horsfall a \\"leading plant pathologist\\".  Life and career  Horsfall was born in Mountain Grove, Montana and was raised in Monticello, Arkansas. The family came from ship owners in Liverpool. Horsfall's father was interested in horticulture and worked at an experimental fruit growing station. He went to study at the University of Arkansas with an interest in cars and engineering. He worked briefly with Dwight Isely, counting insects to determine the timing of insecticide application in cotton. He found himself sidelined, which he claimed was due to his nonconformity. After graduating with a BS in 1925 he went to study plant pathology at Cornell University. James' brother William R. Horsfall became an entomologist. He received his doctorate from Cornell University in 1929. He experimented with tetrachloroquinone to treat diseases since it was a strong oxidant and it was believed that Bordeaux mixture worked through oxidation. Although his experiments made in 1938 showed successful action, it was not possible to publish since the chemical was made by US Rubber Company (Uniroyal) and they made the chemistry known only later. It was however found to break down in sunlight and then they tried 2,3-dichrolo-1,4-naphthoquinone as a substitute. He later experimented, along with Dimond and Heuberger, with sulfur based organic compounds such as disodium ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate. This turned out to be water soluble and they found that the zinc based analog worked better. He later discovered that sugar concentrations in plant parts was correlated with resistance to fungal infection by Alternaria in potatoes. He became a founding editor of the journal Annual Review of Phytopathology.

It is located at the west end of the Lincoln Memorial Bridge on U.S. Route 50 Business in rural Lawrence County, approximately 11 miles (18 km) east of Lawrenceville. Description Lincoln's own memories, and independent fragmentary records, point to the family of Thomas Lincoln entering Illinois in early March, 1830, crossing over the Wabash River by primitive flatboat or ferry from their former home in Indiana. After unloading themselves from the boat, the Lincoln family would have hitched up their oxen to the cart or wagon that carried their modest household goods, and begun to trudge northwest on the primitive trails that led to open, unclaimed farmland in central Illinois. Walker's sculptural installation depicts the scene, with the family, animals, and oxcart depicted in bas-relief carved in Bedford stone and a tall young man, representing the young Lincoln, cast in bronze and given a prominent place on the pedestal in front of the relief. Following their entry into Illinois, the Lincoln family trekked to what is now the Lincoln Trail Homestead State Memorial near Decatur, Illinois, where young Abraham parted ways with his family. The Lincoln Trail State Memorial was installed in 1938 during the administration of Illinois Governor Henry Horner, an admirer of the Lincoln legacy. A bridge had replaced the old flatboats and ferries that had previously crossed the Wabash River. Horner hoped that the Memorial would both pay tribute to the young Lincoln and also serve as a sort of roadside welcome center to westward-bound drivers on U.S. Route 50, which was then a key east- west trunk route in the central U.S. states. Less than thirty years after the installation, however, the federal Interstate highway system bypassed Lawrence County and its Memorial. As of 2011, the Lincoln Trail State Memorial continues to mark a bridge entry-point into Illinois; the Memorial is an unstaffed site operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Rancho Dobe's Storm (12 December, 1949 ‚Äì October, 1960) also known as Storm or Stormie, a Doberman Pinscher, best known for being Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in both 1952 and 1953. He was the grandson of the 1939 champion, Ferry v. Rauhfelsen of Giralda. Born in California, he was sold to his New York-based owner Len Carey at the age of three months. At the age of sixteen months he won Best of Breed at his first adult dog show, something he would repeat in all 25 of the shows he was entered into, becoming undefeated in breed competition. He became a popular sire, having sired over 300 puppies. Royal Doulton released a ceramic figurine of him, and the American Kennel Club inducted him in 1993 as one of only three conformation show dogs in the Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Dog in St. Louis, Missouri. Early life Storm was born on 12 December, 1949, at the Ranch Dobe kennels in Van Nuys, California. He was one of thirteen puppies whelped by his mother, Champion Maedel von Randahof, who died shortly after giving birth. In addition to Storm, only three other puppies survived, Zephyr, Breeze and Gale ‚Äì all females. The puppies great-grandsire was the 1939 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Best in Show winner, Ferry v. Rauhfelsen of Giralda. At the age of three months he was sold by his original owners, Mr and Mrs Brint Edwards to Len Carey, an advertising executive for Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn in New York. Carey had a standing order with the Edwards for the next male Doberman with conformation show potential. Once in New York, Storm lived with Carey and his family in a 12th-floor apartment in Manhattan. Initially the dog had some difficulties with house training and using the elevators, but a strike by elevator workers in New York changed that. \\"Twelve floors down and twelve floors up, four times a day. It housebroke the dog and made a man of my son Jeff.\\" recalled Carey later in an interview for Life magazine. At the age of four months while being walked in Central Park he slipped off his lead while being walked by Mrs Carey, and was seized by a police officer. Charged with permitting an animal to run at large, his owners were fined $1. The normal range of fines for such a charge were between $5 and $25. On another occasion, Storm was left sitting in a parked car with the window open slightly. Mrs Carey returned to the car to find a drunken man had shoved his fist through the gap in the window and was waving his hand around Storm's nose. The dog did not bite, and the entire drive home simply laid down and trembled. The family moved out of the city in 1951 to Cos Cob, Connecticut, from New York. Storm shared the bed of Jeff Carey, Len's son, and ate eggs, biscuits and canned beef for his meals. Show history Storm was entered into his first adult show at the age of sixteen months at the Yonkers Kennel Club. He was named Best of Breed for Dobermans, although was defeated in the Group round by a Boxer who went on to become Best in Show. He had only been trained for ten hours in conformation show handling and maneuvers. More titles followed, during the course of his career he was entered in 25 dog shows and won Best of Breed in all of them. Furthermore, he won his Group round on 22 occasions and was named Best in Show seventeen times. Storm was never entered into competition at the Westchester Kennel Club Shows as his owner was a club official. Len Carey claims that Storm knew how he had performed by the photographers after the event, \\"He knows what a flashbulb is. He's a real ham.\\" Although when a paper crown was placed on his head by a photographer, he knocked it to the floor, chewed on it and then buried it. At the Wilmington Kennel Club Dog Show on 28 April, 1951, he was named Best in Show, beating English Setter Ch. Sir Herbert Kennelworth into second place in front of a crowd of 2,000 people. His thirteenth show was the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1952, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. It was thirteen years since the only previous Doberman had won the title of Best in Show at the event, and the unlucky number was compounded as Stormie was registered in the show catalogue as #13. During the Best in Show round, Storm stood dead still for thirteen minutes while judge Joseph P. Sims reviewed the other competitors, a Dachshund, a Poodle, a Brussels Griffon, a Welsh Terrier and an English Setter. Sims said of Storm, \\"The dog is a great showman and never lets up. I couldn't get away from him.\\" Peter Knopp was Storm's handler during the event, it was the thirteenth occasion he had led a dog to Best in Show. Storm was entered in the 1953 Westminster Kennel Club in order to attempt to retain the title. Only five dogs had previously retained the title over the course of the previous 76 years. He won the Best of Breed title once more, beating 65 other Dobermans in the process. He went on to win the Best in Show title for the second time. Legacy Storm became a popular sire, having sired over 300 puppies by the time he competed at Westminster in 1954. Before his victory at the event in 1953, his stud fees were $100, which went up to $150 after the event. The Careys kept one of Storm's puppies, officially named Stormson, but known about the house as \\"Mo\\". In 1959, one of Storm's sons, named Storm's Donner, won Best in Show at the Westchester Kennel Club Dog Show, an event that Storm himself was never entered into. Donner was line bred to Storm, meaning that Storm was both the dog's father and grandfather. His owner, Len Carey, would return to the Westminster show in 1964 and 1974, but this time as the Best in Show judge. He chose the Whippet Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth and the German Shorthaired Pointer Ch. Gretchenhof Columbia River for the titles, respectively. As of 2011, Storm remains in a group of only eight dogs who have won the Westminster show on more than one occasion, and the only Doberman to have done so. Royal Doulton released a ceramic figurine of Storm between 1955 and 1985. By 2011, these figures were worth $165. Storm is one of only fourteen dogs inducted into the American Kennel Club's Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Dog in St. Louis, Missouri, having been inducted in 1993. He is one of only three show dogs to have been inducted, along with Ch. Bang Away of Sirrah Crest, a Boxer, and Ch. Vin- Melca's Vagabond, a Norwegian Elkhound.

The amendment, placed into an army appropriations bill was designed to give back control of Cuba to the Cuban people. It had eight conditions to which the Cuban Government needed to adhere to before full sovereignty would be transferred. The main conditions of the amendment prohibited Cuba from signing any treaty allowing foreign powers to use the island for military purposes. The United States also maintained the right to interfere with Cuban independence in order to maintain a certain level of protection of life, though the extent of this intrusion was not defined. Most significant, the amendment forced the Cuban Government to sign a treaty officially binding the amendment to law. The United States reasoning behind the amendment was based on the significant commercial interests held on the island. Spain had previously been unable to preserve U.S. interests and maintain law and order. At the end of military occupation, the amendment served as the primary method of ensuring a permanent presence. Due to the previously enacted Teller Amendment, The United States was forced to grant Cuba its independence after Spanish rule ended. Since the Platt Amendment was successfully incorporated into the constitution in Cuba, influence was maintained without direct U.S. involvement in the country.The United States, Cuba, and the Platt Amendment, 1901 .

It can look descriptively at moral behaviour and judgements; it can give practical advice (normative ethics), or it can analyse and theorise about the nature of morality and ethics. Contemporary study of ethics has many links with other disciplines in philosophy itself and other sciences.Almond, Brenda (ed. with D Hill),1991 Applied Philosophy: Morals and Metaphysics in Contemporary Debate London: Routledge.

Logic is a diverse and apparently flexible branch of thought, rather than being thought to underlie mathematics and reasoning, as previously. Postmodernism and its aftermath has left behind the aspiration for an overarching theory of ethics, single ideas which were reputed to explain or justify whole aspects of human experience and knowledge, such as Marxism, religion, Freudianism or nationalism. Writers as diverse as Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard (Lyotard, Jean Fran√ßois, 1979, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge and J L Mackie (1977) point to the decline in grand narratives. Mackie (1977), in particular, saw this decline as undermining the legitimacy of traditional morality. This has stimulated the development of both error theory and meta-ethics as moves to either review or to strengthen the basis of our inherited value systems. As a result, there is growing acceptance of the plausibility of making decisions based on the context,Dancy, Stephen 2004 Ethics Without Principles.

Career StumbleUpon Camp at the 2008 The Next Web Conference in Amsterdam Camp co-founded StumbleUpon in 2002. It was the first web-discovery platform and personalized recommendation engine. The service enabled users to discover web content with a single click, during the Web 2.0 era. In 2006, StumbleUpon relocated to San Francisco, after receiving its first round of funding from Silicon Valley angel investors. In 2007, StumbleUpon was included on the Time magazine's \\"50 Best Websites\\" list, and on its 2013 \\"50 Must-Have iPad Apps\\" list. StumbleUpon was acquired by eBay for $75M in 2007 and later spun-out in 2009, becoming an independent company again. Following its spin- off, Camp worked to expand StumbleUpon's product offerings to include mobile phone app discovery and social networking. Camp grew the company to over one hundred employees and over 25 million registered users as its founding CEO before stepping down in mid 2012 to work on other ventures. In August 2015, StumbleUpon was re-acquired by Camp, who re-gained a majority share of the company after resetting all previous shareholders at $0/share. StumbleUpon continued to have standalone web and mobile apps until mid 2018, when its users were transitioned to the Mix.com, a venture built in part through Camp's studio startup company, Expa. Uber Camp founded Uber as UberCab in early 2009 while he was CEO of StumbleUpon, and self funded the seed round of $250K. Uber launched in San Francisco in mid 2010 with just a few cars on the road and, in late 2010, raised $1.25M in venture capital. In 2011, the company continued to expand across the United States and abroad, including major markets such as New York City and Paris. Uber's motto is \\"Everyone's Private Driver\\" and, in mid-2012, launched UberX and Uber SUV to offer customers low cost options and more vehicle choices. In late 2012, Uber launched UberTAXI, allowing taxi drivers to use the application with taxi-like fares for customers, and, in early 2013, CEO Kalanick announced that Uber would begin offering a ride-sharing service, allowing community drivers to use the application. Uber was listed in Forbes Top 10 Companies of 2012, and was ranked number 6 in Fast Company Most Innovative Companies of 2013. Uber is based in San Francisco, and has expanded in the US and abroad, offering service in over 600 cities worldwide.Dara Kerr and Marrian Zhou, \\"Uber to acquire Middle East competitor Careem for $3.1B,\\" CNET, March 26, 2019.

Background  The Pyramid in 1996 On 14 October 1988, the structure opened as the Enver Hoxha Museum, originally serving as a museum about the legacy of Enver Hoxha, the long-time leader of Communist Albania, who had died three years earlier. The structure was co-designed by Hoxha's daughter Pranvera Hoxha, an architect, and her husband Klement Kolaneci, along with Pirro Vaso and Vladimir Bregu. When built, the Pyramid was said to be the most expensive individual structure ever constructed in Albania. The Pyramid has sometimes been sardonically called the \\"Enver Hoxha Mausoleum\\", although this was never its intended use or official appellation. Post-Communism Top Media studios at the Pyramid After 1991, following the collapse of Communism, the Pyramid ceased its function as a museum and for several years was repurposed as a conference center and exhibition venue, as well as being rebranded with its current name. During the 1999 Kosovo War, the former museum was used as a base by NATO and humanitarian organizations. Since 2001, part of the Pyramid has been used as broadcasting center by Albanian media outlets Top Channel and Top Albania Radio, while the rest of the structure and the paved surrounding area (currently being used as a parking lot and bus station for minivans to Elbasan) have experienced dilapidation and vandalism. Part of Armando Lulaj's film It Wears as it Grows (2011) was shot inside the Pyramid. In 2019, the Pyramid was also used as a filming location for part of a remake of the 1995 cult horror film Castle Freak.  Possible demolition  Numerous proposals to demolish the Pyramid and to redevelop the land of the complex for alternative uses have been made, with the most prominent proposal being the potential construction of a new Albanian parliament building on the site. A previous proposal for the site to become a new opera theater was approved but cancelled shortly after construction work began. The exterior marble tiles covering the structure were removed to a depot outside of Tirana. The proposed demolition of the Pyramid itself became a point of controversy among some leading foreign architects, who have both supported and opposed it. Historian Ardian Klosi initiated a petition against the demolition of the structure, gathering around 6000 signatures. A study published in 2015 but undertaken in 2013 suggests that the majority of citizens of Tirana were against the demolition. It was announced in 2017 that the Pyramid will not be demolished, but refurbished. Youth IT Center Children sliding down the pyramid, 2012 In 2018, a new project was unveiled that would turn the Pyramid into an IT center for youth with a focus on computer programming, robotics, and start ups. The project consists in building staircases on the sides of the pyramid, and glass coverage areas for increased natural light.https://www.mvrdv.nl/projects/312/the-pyramid-of- tirana See also *Enver Hoxha *The Pyramid (Kadare novel)  References  Bibliography  External links  *Pyramid of Tirana Technology Center Official Project * –ú—É–∑–µ–π –≠–Ω–≤–µ—Ä–∞ –•–æ–¥–∂–∞ –≤ –¢–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–µ Buildings and structures in Tirana Monuments and memorials in Albania Pyramids in Europe Enver Hoxha Buildings and structures completed in 1988 1988 establishments in Albania ","title":"Pyramid of Tirana"},{"id":"34282995","text":"The 2012 UCLA Bruins football team represented the University of California, Los Angeles in the 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

He was one of the leading British two-year-old of his generation, winning six of his nine races in 1869. The following year he finished third in the 2000 Guineas and then recorded his most important victory when winning The Derby. Later in the year he finished second in the St Leger. Kingcraft remained in training for two more seasons but had little further success and was retired to stud. He was later sold for export to the United States but died in transit to his new base in Kentucky. Background Kingcraft, a handsome but \\"delicate- looking\\" bay horse standing 16 hands high, was bred by his owner Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth at his stud at Mereworth Castle in Kent. He was sired by King Tom a successful racehorse who became an important sire, being the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1870 and 1871. Lord Falmouth sent the colt into training with Mathew Dawson at his private stable at Heath House at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1869: two-year-old season Kingcraft began his career in a Triennial Stakes at Ascot in which he was beaten a head by a filly. He then won his next six races including the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket, the Ham Stakes at Goodwood and the Convivial Stakes at York. In autumn he ran at Newmarket, winning the Buckenham Stakes and a Triennial Stakes and then walking over in the October Produce Stakes when no other horses opposed him, before contesting one of the year's most prestigious two-year-old races, the Middle Park Plate. His previous successes meant that he had to carry a seven pound weight penalty, as did the season's leading filly Sunshine. In a rough finish, Sunshine was beaten a head by another filly, Frivolity, with Kingcraft a further head behind in third. On his final start in the Criterion Stakes he was beaten by yet another filly named Hester, who went on to win the following year's 1000 Guineas. Although the defeat was disappointing, it was pointed out that Kingcraft was not an \\"every day\\" horse and may not have recovered from his run in the Middle Park. Kingcraft's performances as a two year old earned his owner ¬£3,765. Kingcraft went into the winter break regarded as the leading colt of his generation, being second favourite for the 1870 Derby behind Sunshine. 1870: three- year-old season Lord Falmouth, Kingcraft's owner Kingcraft remained a leading fancy for the Classics in the spring of 1870, but a great deal of interest and money was invested in an unraced colt called Macgregor. One analysis of the candidates for the 2000 Guineas offered the view that while Kingcraft possessed brilliant speed, his courage or \\"pluck\\" was questionable. On his three-year-old debut, Kingcraft started 2/1 favourite for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket in a field of ten runners. He produced a \\"miserable\\" effort, never reaching the lead and finishing third, seven lengths behind Macgregor who won very impressively. Macgregor was the subject of a huge public gamble for the Derby on June 1, and was made one of the shortest-priced favourites in the history of the race at odds of 4/9. Kingcraft on the other hand was almost forgotten and started a 20/1 outsider in a field of fifteen. According to a report in The Spectator the weather on Derby day was poor and the crowd smaller than usual. Ridden by Tom French, Kingcraft was saddled away from the main paddock and disappointed the crowd by failing to take part in the parade in front of the stands. The start of the race was delayed for some time by the behaviour of Cockney Boy who refused to line up with the other runners. When the race got under way French restrained Kingcraft at the back of the field in the early stages before making steady progress from half way. Approaching the turn into the straight, French pulled Kingcraft to the wide outside, avoiding the congestion and bumping along the rail. The outsiders Palmerston and Muster led the race in the straight from Macgregor, but two furlongs from the finish the favourite came under pressure and was soon beaten. French made his move on Kingcraft just over a furlong from the finish, took the lead from Palmerston and quickly pulled clear to win by four lengths. The win delighted the bookmakers who had heavy liabilities on Macgregor. Lord Falmouth had accepted a bet of sixpence on Kingcraft from the wife of his trainer Mathew Dawson. After Kingcraft won, he presented Mrs Dawson with a sixpence set in a ¬£500 silver bracelet. Kingcraft was allowed to walk over in the Great Surrey Foal Stakes at the same meeting. The difficulties of early telegraphic communication were illustrated by the reporting of the race by the \\"American Press Association\\". Receiving two slightly different reports of the race within a short space of time, the APA reporter assumed that two different events were being described and reported that the race had been run in two heats, with Kingcraft winning both. On 24 September, Kingcraft started 2/1 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster ahead of Palmerston and Sunlight. Tom French held Kingcraft up in the early stages before producing him on the inside to take the lead in the straight. He looked the likely winner until Hawthornden emerged with a strong challenge on the wide outside. Inside the final furlong Kingcraft was overtaken and beaten half a length in an exciting finish. Later at the same meeting he ran in the Doncaster Stakes over one and a half miles in which he started favourite at 7/4 but finished fourth of the five runners behind Enterprise. In October, Kingcraft ran four times at Newmarket, but his only success came when he walked over in the Select Stakes. He finished second in a Triennial Stakes, fourth in the Newmarket St Leger and fourth in the All-Aged Stakes. His performances led to speculation that his hard race in the St Leger had \\"subdued his spirit\\" Later career Kingcraft had little success in two more seasons, although he ran in many important races. In April 1871 he was beaten by Palmerston in the Claret Stakes at Newmarket. At Ascot in June Kingcraft ran in the Gold Cup in which he finished fifth of the seven runners behind the French-trained Mortemer. He was also beaten in a Triennial Stakes and the same meeting. At Newmarket in October that autumn he started at odds of 20/1 for the Cesarewitch Handicap and ran unplaced behind Corisande. Later that month at the same racecourse he finished fifth to Sabinus in the Cambridgeshire. On 23 April 1872 Kingcraft returned to Epsom, the scene of his biggest win, and ran unplaced in the City and Suburban Handicap won by Digby Grand. At Goodwood in July he produced his best performance for almost two years when he stayed on in the straight to take third place behind the favourite Spennithorne in the Goodwood Stakes over two and a half miles. Later that season he ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup and was made joint favourite. Ridden by Charles Maidment he held the lead in the closing stages but although he ran on with \\"great gameness\\" he was beaten a head by the three-year-old Vanderdecken. The winning time of 2:33.5 was one of the fastest ever recorded for a mile and a half. Assessment William Allison, in his book \\"Memories of Men and Horses\\" described Kingcraft as \\"the best-looking Derby winner I have seen\\" but \\"a bad one according to classic standard.\\" The Pall Mall Budget called Kingcraft \\"one of the worst horses which have ever won the Derby\\" and his opposition at Epsom as \\"rubbish.\\" Stud career Kingcraft was retired to his owners stud where he had limited success. The best of his offspring were Swift and Vernet, both of whom won the Grand Crit√©rium. When Lord Falmouth decided to dispose of all his horses in 1884 Kingcraft was bought for 500 guineas by Lord Rossmore. Four months later on 8 December Lord Rossmore sold Kingcraft for 530 guineas. He was sent to Ireland where he stood at the Athgarvan Stud at the Curragh. The best of his Irish runners was Springfield Maid a notable steeplechaser who won the Irish Grand National and the Galway Plate. He was later sold to Daniel Swigert of Elmendorf Farm at the end of 1886, but died on board ship six days after leaving England.

The film premiered at the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival and was aired on many stations on August 6, 2005, the 60th anniversary of the bombings. The title of the film was inspired by Thomas Merton's poem of the same name, which is quoted throughout the film. The documentary employs color footage that had previously been labeled top secret by the US government. The 2005 airing of Original Child Bomb was the most extensive exposure to date of this footage in the United States. It had been filmed by both the United States military and Japanese camera crews. Original Child Bomb was directed by Carey McKenzie and produced by Holly Becker.  Synopsis  Original Child Bomb begins with a recreation of the dropping of Little Boy from the perspective of Hiroshima's residents. It is joined with both historical and contemporary footage and overlaid with various voice- overs. The documentary moves on to offer the accounts of several Japanese witnesses of the atomic bombing destruction. The final part of the documentary consists of interviews with American students in a modern classroom setting. Much of the film is presented in a montage style.  Title  The title of the film comes from Thomas Merton's poem of the same name, Original Child Bomb. The phrase \\"original child bomb\\" was derived from the Japanese term for the atom bomb, genshi bakudan. Genshi, which means \\"atom,\\" contains root characters which, when rendered individually, can be taken to mean \\"original\\" and \\"child.\\" Merton's poem claims, as does the documentary, that the Japanese called the weapon the \\"original child bomb\\" because the bomb was the first of its kind. It is unlikely, however, that native Japanese speakers would have translated genshi as such, or that the phrase \\"original child bomb\\" was ever used by the Japanese.  Awards  At the 2004 AFI-Discovery Channel Silverdocs Documentary Festival, Original Child Bomb won the Sterling Award along with Death in Gaza.

Tracking northwestwards and intensifying over water, Oscar attained typhoon strength on September 14. Typhoon Oscar reached its maximum intensity of high winds with 260 kilometres per hour (160 miles per hour) and a minimum central pressure of 925 millibars (hPa; 27.32 inHg) on September 14. The eye was well-developed, and it headed towards Japan. Oscar recurved northeastwards two days later, skirted past Honsh≈´ on September 17 and started weakening. Oscar was downgraded to a tropical storm, then the system became extratropical on September 18. In Japan, Oscar claimed nine lives and injured at least 13 people. Six people were reported missing and about 600 houses were damaged by high winds and flood water. Preparations and Impact Super Typhoon Oscar approaching Japan. Dozens of domestic flights and sea ferries were canceled. Storm and flood warnings were issued across most of Japan's eastern coastal and central areas. As the typhoon's center moved north, the most powerful area near its center touched coastal areas southeast of Tokyo. At 6 A.M. on September 17, the typhoon was centered almost directly over Aoga Island, 225 miles south of Tokyo, moving north-northeast at 21 miles per hour. Forecasters predicted that Tokyo would receive up to 12 inches of rain over 36 hours. Seven major train lines and subways in and around Tokyo reduced service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but wind-carried objects, such as tree branches, hurt at least 20 people and sudden wind gusts knocked people down.\\"Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆÂè∞È¢®„Éñ„É©„Ç∑Êµ∑Â≤∏\\" The Cavalier Daily.

The old, long-familiar phrase was made famous by Ma Nuo, a 20-year-old female contestant on the television show Fei Cheng Wu Rao (also known in English as If You Are the One). The line was in response to a question by an unemployed suitor who asked if Ma would \\"ride a bicycle with him\\" on a date. The series of events have been summed up in the media with the quip \\"I would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle.\\" Author In interviews after the show, Ma pointedly denied that she is a \\"gold digger\\" ‚Äì saying that she \\"just wanted to reject [her suitor] in a creative way.\\" Nonetheless, the phrase has made its rounds across the Chinese blogosphere, and has become emblematic of the culture of materialism and lack of authenticity that now allegedly permeates Chinese society, particularly in the process of dating and courtship. Social commentator Chen Zhigang remarked, \\"Does Ma Nuo only speak for herself? No. Her opinion resonates with youth; they have grown up in a society that is quickly accumulating material wealth. They are snobbish. They worship money, cars and houses because the highly developing economy has made them do so.\\" Analysis The blunt nature of the statement works well in the dating show's format, and is not the first controversial phrase to arise out of Fei Cheng Wu Rao. It was cited by critics as a window to the \\"degradation of Chinese social values,\\" and even drew the attention of government censors, who eventually forced producers to re-design the format of the show to be more professional and 'clean' of morally questionable content. A Global Times commentary remarked that the obsession with BMWs is symbolic of a larger national trend that measures a person's success solely by money rather than factors such as \\"knowledge, taste, kindness or vision.\\" The phrase also earned notoriety for Ma, whose purported pictures began surfacing all over the internet despite strong dislike from the public. Professor Jinhua Zhao of the University of British Columbia referred to the quote to allude to trends in the last decade of Beijing residents opting to get rid of their bikes in favour of cars as a mode of transport, citing the social perception that, \\"bikes are now for losers.\\" See also * List of internet meme References 2010 in China Quotations from television Internet memes Words and phrases introduced in 2010 Bicycles BMW ","title":"I would rather cry in a BMW"},{"id":"34283564","text":"William Patrick James Sandford (born 27 January 1989) is a rugby union player with Aviva Premiership side London Welsh.
