History Foundation The institute was first established at Lyon, France, in 1808, and later at Paris, in 1814, and finally approved by Pope Gregory XVI on 18 February 1834. The founder, Jean-Baptiste Rauzan, was born at Bordeaux on 5 December 1757, and died in Paris, 5 September 1847. After completing his ecclesiastical studies, he taught theology and sacred eloquence and later was chosen Vicar-General of Bordeaux where he inaugurated a missionary movement. Founder of the Fathers of Mercy After preaching in the Diocese of Troyes the institute received from the Government of Emperor Napoleon I, unsolicited, subsidies to defray the expenses of their missions. However, following Napoleon's dispute with Pope Pius VII, the society, called the Missionaries of France, was suppressed. In 1814, at the suggestion of Cardinal Fesch, Father Rauzan and his colleagues, were joined by the young Vicar-General of Chamb√©ry, de Forbin-Janson, afterwards Bishop of Nancy, Denis-Luc Frayssinous, who founded St. Stanislaus College and instructed the young missionaries in sacred eloquence, Legris Duval, the St. Vincent de Paul of his day, Le Vasseur, Bach, Armand-Benjamin Caillau and Carboy. They evangelized the French cities of Orl√©ans, Poitiers, Tours, Rennes, Marseilles, Toulon, Paris and other places, and established the Works of St. Genevi√®ve and the Association of the Ladies of Providence in many parts of France. Rauzan founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Clotilde for the education of young ladies. The royal family assisted him financially and gave him the Mount Valerian, at that time the center of piety, and later one of the principal forts protecting the capital. In 1830, during the second Revolution, the Missionaries of France were dispersed and exiled and their house in Paris sacked. Rauzan went to Rome, where he was received by Pope Gregory XVI, who authorized him to found a new society, to be known as the Fathers of Mercy. The Papal Brief of approbation, which also contains the constitutions, was given 18 February 1834, and on 15 March of the same year a second Brief, affiliating the new society to the Propaganda Fide, and the former Missionaries of France accepted these constitutions on 8 December 1835. Its members included Mgr Faillet, Bishop of Orl√©ans, Mgr. Duquesnay, Archbishop of Cambrai, Victor-Felix Bernadou, Archbishop of Sens, who later became a cardinal. The Fathers of Mercy resumed their missionary activities in France, but all religious societies were subject to the decree of expulsion in 1880. However, through the influence of their many friends in Paris, and claiming the enforcement of the authorization given to the society by the restored Bourbon king Louis XVIII in 1816, the Fathers of Mercy retained their mother- house in Paris until the separation of the Church and State in 1905, when they moved to Belgium. In 1839, at the suggestion of Bishop Hughes of New York, Mgr. Forbin-Janson introduced the Fathers of Mercy into the United States, initially in the Diocese of New Orleans. Bishop Potiers of Mobile, Alabama, then invited them to take charge of Spring Hill College. Two years later, Fathers Lafont and Aubril were sent to look after the increasing French population in New York City, where the Fathers of Mercy took charge of the parishes of St. Vincent de Paul, Manhattan, and of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Francis de Chantal, Brooklyn. They also set up houses of studies in Rome, Belgium, France and other places. By a decree of Propaganda in August 1906, Theophile Wucher was named Vicar General of the Institute for three years and took up residence in New York. the Fathers had one house, their Generalate, in Auburn, Kentucky at South Union. The Community Chapel of Divine Mercy A view of the sanctuary and nave from the choir loft in the Chapel of Divine Mercy near the end of construction In the spring of 2006 the Fathers of Mercy began construction on the Chapel of Divine Mercy. This chapel took over 2 years to construct and in August 2008 was consecrated, by the Most Rev. John Jeremiah McRaith, and opened to the public. Events Several events are held annually at the Fathers of Mercy Generalate and the Chapel of Divine Mercy. These include the Divine Mercy celebration, the Corpus Christi procession, and the celebrations of vows and Ordinations. Charism The Fathers of Mercy define their charism as: > Nature: We are a religious clerical congregation of pontifical right. > General Purpose: The honor of God and the sanctification of our members. > Specific Purpose: The following of Christ and the perfection of the > individual members through our apostolate for the propagation of the Faith > and the salvation of souls. Character: We are entirely ordered to the > apostolate, with our primary focus on the Spiritual Works of Mercy. This > apostolate may be undertaken among those without the true Faith or among the > faithful living in rural or neglected areas. The primary apostolate of the > Fathers of Mercy is the preaching of parish missions and retreats; we also > assist bishops with the staffing of rural parishes. Spirit: Our work > emphasizes the Mercy of God: Our venerable founder, Father Jean Baptiste > Rauzan, provided us with the \\"Father of the Prodigal Son\\" as our model, as > well as the scripture verse: \\"He was moved with mercy\\" (cf. Luke 15:20) as > our motto. Missionary spirit and zeal for the salvation of souls: This is > seen in our preaching parish missions to believers, in our parish work, in > our missions to non-believers, in our administration of the Sacraments, > especially the Sacraments of Confession and the Holy Eucharist, and the > preaching of the Word of God. Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary: Our > specific form of devotion is to the Immaculate Conception, because we were > placed under this title of Our Lady by Pope Gregory XVI when he approved our > Congregation in 1834, some twenty years before Pope Pius IX defined the > dogma in 1854. Obedience to all lawful authority - ecclesiastical and civil: > We are especially obedient to the Pope, to the Bishops in whose dioceses we > are serving, and to our Superior General. Sound Traditions: Devotion to the > Rosary: We recite five decades of the rosary every day and celebrate the > Memorial of Our Lady of the Rosary on October 7th with great solemnity. Our > Founder, Father Rauzan, often prayed the Rosary knowing that it was the best > means that his missionaries had for winning souls for the honor of God and > their own sanctification. Seeking the protection of the Blessed Mother: We > end all our spiritual exercises with the ancient prayer Sub tuum praesidium: > We fly unto thy patronage, O Holy Mother of God.Despise not our petitions in > our necessities, but deliver us from all dangers,O Ever Glorious and Blessed > Virgin. Consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary: Our members consecrate > themselves to the Blessed Virgin Mary every year on the Solemnity of the > Immaculate Conception, December 8th. We have a yearly novena to our Lady > under this title, and this is a solemnity proper to our Congregation. The > original Constitutions drawn up by Father Rauzan affirmed the belief that > one goes surely to Jesus through Mary. Placing ourselves under the patronage > of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we profess our Final/Perpetual Vows on August > 15th, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and we try > to schedule all of our Ordinations on a Marian feast day. Distinctive habit: > Our habit, given to us by our Founder, which he adopted from the secular > clergy, is a black Roman cassock with a black cincture. In addition, a badge > with the emblem of the Congregation - the Return of the Prodigal Son - is > worn on the upper left side of the habit.

Tifft is a retired astronomer at the University of Arizona. His main interests are in galaxies, superclusters and redshift quantization.William G. Tifft's Personal Web page at the U. Arizona He was influential in the development of the first redshift surveys, and was an early proponent of manned space astronomy, conducted at a proposed moon base for example. In retirement, he is a principal scientist with The Scientific Association for the Study of Time in Physics and Cosmology (SASTPC). He has an A.B. in Astronomy from Harvard University (1954), and Ph.D. in Astronomy from the California Institute of Technology (1958) where he wrote his dissertation on photoelectric photometry. Redshift quantization Based on observations of nearby galaxies, Tifft proposed that the redshifts of galaxies are quantized, or that they occur preferentially as multiples of a set number. These findings on redshift quantization were originally published in 1976 and 1977 in the Astrophysical Journal. The ideas were controversial when originally proposed; the editors of the Astrophysical Journal included a note in one of the papers stating that they could neither find errors within the analysis nor endorse the analysis. Subsequently, Tifft and Cocke put forward a theory to try to explain the quantization. Tifft's results were supported by Martin Croasdale, who claimed the effect to be statistically significant and the same over the whole sky, and later Napier and Guthrie. Since the initial publication of these results, Tifft's findings have been used by others, such as Halton Arp, in making an alternative explanation to the Big Bang Theory, which states that galaxies are redshifted because the universe is expanding. However, they have not found widespread support and are now dismissed by the majority of astronomers. Tifft himself, when interviewed for the popular science magazine Discover in 1993, stated that he was not necessarily claiming that the universe was not expanding.Dava Sobel, \\"Man stops universe, maybe - William Tifft believes the universe may not be expanding\\", Discover, April, 1993) External links *Tifft Articles at the NASA ADS Database References American astronomers Cosmologists Living people University of Arizona faculty Harvard University alumni California Institute of Technology alumni Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"William G.

Despite air raids, a submarine attack, and casualties among sister ships, she commenced off-loading supplies on D-Day, 8 November, at Fedhala, French Morocco. Mission accomplished, the cargo ship returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 24 November and began preparations for a Pacific voyage. USS Oberon (AK-58) in 1942. Early in the new year, Oberon transited the Panama Canal; and, while sailing for the South Pacific, was reclassified AKA‚Äì14. She discharged her cargo at New Caledonia and the New Hebrides before returning to Norfolk, on 12 March 1943. Completing overhaul Oberon again crossed the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and took station, 10 July, off Gela for the landings on Sicily. Two months later her anti-aircraft batteries again blazed during unloading operations in the difficult invasion of Salerno Bay, Italy. Withdrawn to sail the Oran to Bizerte supply run, Oberon departed the area in December with 120 Army paratroopers and supplies bound for Belfast, Northern Ireland. Later that month an Atlantic storm caused more damage than had enemy actions. After repairs in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Oberon returned to North Africa in April via Cardiff, Wales. As part of Assault Group II preparing for the invasion of Southern France she practiced landings until 13 August along both the Algerian and Italian coasts. D-Day, the 15th, went smoothly as she landed 151 soldiers and sailors plus valuable support equipment at St. Tropez, France. After five additional logistic missions from Oran and Naples, the attack transport joined a convoy en route to the United States late in October. With Germany facing defeat, Oberon was reassigned to the Pacific. Once again she began the new year in transit through the Panama Canal, and then proceeded to Leyte, Philippines arriving on 21 February 1945. With other units of Amphibious Group 7 she helped to take Kerama Retto late in March and joined the attack on Okinawa on 1 April. The appearance of kamikaze planes the next day was a challenging new experience from which Oberon emerged unscathed and with one kill to her credit. She retired on 26 April to the South Pacific and later received news of Japan's capitulation while steaming to the Philippines. With occupation troops from the 81st Division embarked she sailed into port at Aomori, on northern Honsh≈´, on 25 September. After an additional voyage to Yokohama, Oberon turned homeward and early in December reached San Francisco. Oberon circa 1950. Korean War In the post-war years, Oberon served with the Navy Transportation Service carrying cargo and personnel between the West Coast and American bases in the Pacific. Incorporated into the Military Sea Transportation Service at its initiation on 1 October 1949, she became an ammunition replenishment vessel during the Korean War. Arriving at Sasebo, Japan, on 15 January 1951, Oberon served in the war zone for seven months. On 9 March she conducted her first rearming-at-sea mission with carriers, and later much of her time was spent shuttling supplies between Sasebo and Wonsan, Korea.

He has worked for the German classical record label, Deutsche Grammophon, and has recorded artists such as the Emerson String Quartet, Daniel Barenboim, Gil Shaham, David Finckel, Wu Han, and numerous others. Since the early 1980s and has won several Grammy Awards for his recordings. Childhood and Early Years Seetoo began playing the violin at age two and a half. Seetoo's mother was a pianist and his father was a violinist who taught at the Shanghai Conservatory. He grew up during China's Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76) and had to practice with the windows closed because Western music was forbidden. His father was able to purchase, at great expense, a Telefunken reel-to-reel hybrid tube and transistor based tape deck so he could copy any of the recordings that were circulated underground. ‚ÄúNo one knew how to fix it, so I learned how to fix it myself. I was always interested in electronics. I built my first radio when I was seven years old,‚Äù he related. He skipped the first four years of college, going directly to the Shanghai Conservatory where he was a violin prodigy. In 1979 he played for Boston Symphony concertmaster Joseph Silverstein who recommended him to the Curtis Institute of Music where he was admitted without a live audition. He studied with Ivan Galamian, graduated in 1984, and continued graduate studies at the Juilliard School of Music, studying with the legendary Dorothy DeLay. He became known for making audition tapes for students. ‚ÄúPeople knew I was always tinkering with recordings ‚Äì it came naturally,‚Äù he said. He started a performance career after graduating from Juilliard, but found the lifestyle lonely and unsatisfying. After six months he was asked to fill in for a sick engineer who was recording Bach Partitas for violinist Eugene Drucker of the Emerson Quartet.

In the , Calen had a population of 390 people.  Geography  The locality of Calen is loosely bounded by One Mile Creek to the south and Blackrock Creek to the north. The land is mostly flat and used for sugar cane farming, apart from some undeveloped mountains across the western boundary of the locality and some small undeveloped hill land in the east which is on the Queensland coast. The Bruce Highway passes from the south-east to the north- west of the locality. The North Coast railway line runs immediately north and parallel to the highway. The town of Calen is located in the south-eastern part of the locality with the highway and railway passing through it. The Calen railway station is located in the town. A second town of Kolijo is located on the south-eastern edge of the locality, again with the highway and railway passing through it. Calen and Kolijo are separated by St Helens Creek, which might explain the development of two towns less than apart. A neighbourhood called Moondaba exists at the north-western edge of the locality along the highway and railway line. It takes its name from the former Moondaba railway station and is reportedly an Aboriginal word meaning place of snakes. Moondaba is very close to the town of Pindi Pindi to the north, but they are separated by the Blackrock Creek. The locality of Calen has a network of privately operated tramway lines for transporting sugar cane to the sugar mill. History The town of Kolijo takes its name from the former Kolijo railway station which was named on 9 March 1923 by the Queensland Railways Department, reportedly an Aboriginal word meaning possum. The town of Calen takes its name from the Calen railway station which was named on 8 February 1924 by the Queensland Railway Department, reportedly being an Aboriginal name meaning cloud.

It was made available on the Xbox Live Marketplace in 2008. Gameplay The player character, Raze, has attacks consisting of using his wrist blade and rolling. When an enemy Kewlett is killed, it splatters on the screen or bursts into bloody chunks. Raze can suck up the Kewlett chunks to restore his health and can use stealth mode. Raze also sucks up insects called Squibs, which serve as ammunition. The Kewletts want to exterminate the Squibs. Different types of Squibs have varying effects, such as: Raze can breathe fire by sucking in flames, much as he does to the Squibs. Red crystals are scattered about the levels that explode when attacked. Four mini-games can be unlocked in Raze's Hell: *Survival ‚Äì Survive waves of Kewletts and get a high score. *Silent but Deadly - Use stealth mode to sneak around Kewlett fortresses. *Cojones Golf & Country Golf ‚Äì Knock around a large white ball in an 18-hole golf course or play a game of mini-golf. *Blood Rain ‚Äì Protect a Shnow from hordes of parachuting Kewlett troops.

Plot For centuries the Kewletts, a cute and happy race, lived an idyllic existence inside the hallowed walls of Kewtopia. They never went outside the gates of their city because they had everything they needed inside: a wonderful princess, perfect weather, wealth, and privilege. The Kewletts parody different types of cute creatures found in the media. Kewletts get their news from a show called QTV'. Before the events in the game, the Kewletts lived isolated from the rest of their world. Their first attempt at diplomacy with the creatures of the hinterlands was brief and failed. Afterwards, their Princess decided to launch \\"Operation Fresh Hope\\" to \\"cutetify\\" all of the monsters outside of Kewtopia. The true nature behind \\"Operation Fresh Hope\\", unknown to most Kewletts, is the retrieval of three ancient artifacts that the Princess desires due to her being a Huggly. Because the Kewletts are intensely nationalistic, they support the idea of expanding Kewletts throughout the war have no problems with \\"cleansing\\" the hinterlands of all monsters. Their belligerent, racist worldview is in sharp contrast to their cute, gentle appearance. The Kewletts' increasingly vicious colonization efforts carry on until they meet Raze, an ugly, simple beast who is transformed when he accidentally stumbles upon ancient artifacts. Raze's heroics spark a swelling underground guerrilla movement. Reception Raze's Hell received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

He is influenced by artists such as Rubens, Titian, Michelangelo and Vel√°zquez. Although Durand is perhaps best known for his allegorical portraits, such as Princess Diana as Fortuna, he achieved international artistic acclaim for his official portraits of John Paul II (1983) and the 14th Dalai Lama (1982,Commissioned by Pietro Francesco Mele 1983, 1989). Durand's portrait of the Irish novelist Elizabeth Bowen (1972) is one of the most popular portraits in London's National Portrait Gallery. In 1970 Durand painted a series of pictures inspired by the dancers of the Royal Ballet. It is nevertheless Durand's extraordinary mythological narratives that demonstrate his profound understanding of the myths and rituals of both Classical and Christian traditions. These are an ever-present undercurrent of his work. John Paul II, 1983. 14th Dalai Lama with a white lotus, 1983 From May to October 2006, a major exhibition of paintings, Durand Wholly Pictures, was displayed in Sussex cathedrals and churches. This series of pictures, painted between 2000 and 2006, depicts Christian narratives set against the Sussex countryside. Durand recognizes that the need is greater today than ever before for artists to take up devotional subjects in painting. Durand paints his sacred subjects for the benefit of those who are not satisfied by postmodern fashions in this post secular era as much as for churchgoers. left The Coronation of the Virgin, Stopham Bridge, Pulborough, 2006. November 1, 2007, marked the 20th anniversary of the unveiling of Durand's Votive Offering, which was painted to launch and benefit the AIDS charity Crusaid in 1987. A unique on-line exhibition about Votive Offering, its sources, and Durand's allegorical pictures of Diana, Princess of Wales, is to be found in Durand Gallery Exhibitions. On November 29, 2007, a new picture, Daniel in the Lions' Den is to be unveiled. The picture, and the Idea Fine Art limited edition prints of the picture, each signed and numbered by the artist, is to be benefit Demelza Hospice Care for Children. As Durand has said: 'almost all the young people that inspire me to paint them have something in common. I am convinced that I have met them before in a painting. When I consider the teenage behavior of the deities and saints in mythology or the Bible, not to mention heroes and heroines, the kids in my pictures are appropriate symbols of such protagonists.' How suitable therefore, for Durand to have represented the bravery of Daniel confronting death amongst the lions as a tribute to Demelza's dedication and sensitivity to the uniqueness of the physical, social, intellectual, emotional, cultural and spiritual needs of every child and their family. In 2011 after his return to Italy and particularly Torre del Greco and Sperlonga we witness a new period in Andr√© Durand's artistic trajectory fully manifest, first in the pictures he painted in Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Sperlonga where Durand held an open studio for almost two years as artist in residence and later in Fondi. At the invitation of doctor Marina Sapelli Ragni, Soprintendente per i Beni Archeologici della Regione Lazio and the director and personnel of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Sperlonga from 2010-2012 the artist began a body of work, including a series of tondi (round format paintings) on the subject of the Via Lucis. These pictures were finished in the Palazzo Caetani in 2013. The famous Grotto of Tiberius can be seen in the background of five of the six tondos. One painting Brother Carlo saving the Head of Ulysses was painted for the exhibition Dialogues with the Antique - Dialoghi con l'Antico curated by the archaeologist and author Marina Sapelli Ragni at the Villa Adriana, Tivoli in 2011. Durand's vision of a monk who stoically rescues the severed head of Odysseus. 2012 also saw the publication of several books of Durand's photographs. Notably, Photographing Statues for a Year, photographs the artist took of the statues in the museum from every point of view and in every imaginable lighting conditions. The text was co-written by the museum's director, Marisa de'Spagnolis and published by L'Erma di Bretschneider, and is the only comprehensive archive of photographs of the museum's collection, including two dozen photographs of the celebrated Head of Ulysses that bring the statue (on special loan to the Scuderie del Quirinale, Augustus exhibition October‚ÄìJanuary 2014) to life.  2013: Poesie from the Gods to Jesus Christ - Paintings 2010-2013  For the exhibition at the Caetani Palace in Fondi, Italy, Poesie from the Gods to Jesus Christ, a limited edition catalogue was published under the auspices of the Rotary and Rotaract clubs of Terracina and Fondi. The exhibition also offered a special opportunity to see Durand's official portrait of John Paul II (2004 second version) and the allegory of Giulia Gonzaga that has captivated all Fondi entitled Homage to Titian and Giulia Gonzaga.

From 1842 to 1848, the elected House of Assembly and appointed Legislative Council sat together as a single Amalgamated Assembly. After 1848, the two legislative bodies again sat separately. In 1854, the British Government granted a new constitution to Newfoundland establishing an Executive Council of not more than seven members of the majority party and a Legislative Council of not more than 15 members upon nomination of the ministry. The Legislative Council of Newfoundland and the House of Assembly met for the last time in February 1934 to pass the legislation which provided for their suspensions. The Royal Commission which was established in 1933 concluded that Newfoundland's problems were self-made, as noted in the Amulree Report, and it was recommended that the legislature be suspended and be replaced by a Commission of Government appointed by the British Government.

College In 1981, Martin went to Louisiana State University (LSU). As a wide receiver for LSU's football team, Martin had 2,625 yards receiving, which at the time was the most career passing yards caught by any receiver in Southeastern Conference (SEC) history. Martin's best season came during his junior year in 1983 when he had 1,064 receiving, which at the time was the 3rd best single-season performance in SEC history. That year, Martin became the first wide receiver in LSU history to be awarded All-American honors. He was also selected to the first team of the All-SEC Team, becoming the first LSU wide receiver to achieve that feat since Andy Hamilton (first team All-SEC Team, 1971). As a senior, Martin was again selected to the first team of the All-SEC Team, becoming the first LSU wide receiver in history to be named twice to the first team All-SEC Team.

White's best known work is The Contribution of the Negro to American Democracy, a mural at Hampton University. In 2018, the centenary year of his birth, the first major retrospective exhibition of his work was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Modern Art. Early life and education Charles Wilbert White was born on April 2, 1918, to Ethelene Gary, a domestic worker, and Charles White Sr, a railroad and construction worker, on the South Side of Chicago. His parents never married and his mother raised him‚Äîas she had no child care, she would often leave him at the public library. There White developed an affinity for art and reading at a young age. White's mother bought him a set of oil paints when he was seven years old, which hooked White on painting. White also played music as a child, studied modern dance, and was part of theatre groups; however, he stated that art was his true passion. White's mother also took him to the Art Institute of Chicago, where he would read and look at paintings‚Äîdeveloping a particular interest in the works of Winslow Homer and George Inness. Since White had little money growing up, he often painted on whatever surfaces he could find including shirts, cardboard, and window blinds. During the Great Depression, young White tried to conceal his passion for art in fear of embarrassment; however, this ended when White got a job painting signs at the age of fourteen. White learned how to mix paints by sitting-in every day for a week on an Art Institute sponsored painting class that was taking place at a park near his home.\\"Oral history interview with Charles W. White, 1965 March 9\\", Archives of American Art, Smithsonian. His mother re-married when White's father died in 1926. She married a steel mill worker who would become an abusive alcoholic, especially towards a young White, leaving him to escape into art. This is also the same year his mother began sending him to Mississippi twice a year to his aunts, Hasty Baines and Harriet Baines, where he would learn about his heritage and African American Southern folklore - these themes would heavily influence his art for the rest of his career as an artist. An early activist, as a teenager, he volunteered his talents and became the house artist at the National Negro Congress in Chicago. Later, in a union with fellow black artists, White was arrested while picketing. White won a grant during the seventh grade to attend Saturday art classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. After reading Alain Locke's book The New Negro: An Interpretation, a critique of the Harlem Renaissance, White's social views changed. He learned after reading Locke's text about important African American figures in American history, and questioned his teachers on why they were not taught to students in school, causing some to label him a \\"rebel problematic child\\". White did not graduate from high school, having lost a year due to his refusal to attend class after being disillusioned with the teaching system. While he was encouraged by his art teachers to submit his art works and won various scholarships, these would later be taken away from him as an \\"error\\" and given to whites instead. He was admitted to two art schools, each then pulled his acceptance because of his race. White ultimately received a full scholarship to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While there, White identified Mitchell Siporin, Francis Chapin, and Aaron Bohrod as his influences. He was an excellent draftsman, completing five drawing courses and received a final \\"A grade\\". To pay the costs of art supplies, White became a cook, using his mother's instruction and recipes. White later became an art teacher at St. Elizabeth Catholic High School. Career In 1938, White was hired by the Illinois Art Project a state affiliate of the Works Progress Administration. His work received an extended showing at the Chicago Coliseum during the Exhibition of the Art of the American Negro, which was part of the American Negro Exposition commemorating the 75th anniversary of Thirteenth Amendment ending slavery. An important figure in what became known as the Chicago Black Renaissance, White taught art classes at the Southside Community Art Center. Following his first show at Paragon Studios in Cincinnati in 1938, White's work was exhibited widely throughout the United States, including, among many others, exhibitions at the Roko Gallery, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1939 he produced his WPA mural Five Great American Negroes, now at Howard University Gallery of Art. White also showed at the Palace of Culture in Warsaw and the Pushkin Museum. In 1976 his work was featured in Two Centuries of Black American Art, LACMA's first exhibition devoted exclusively to African-American Artists. White moved to New Orleans in 1941 to teach at Dillard University. Beginning in that year, he was married briefly to famed sculptor and printmaker Elizabeth Catlett, who also taught at Dillard. He served in the US Army during WWII, but was discharged when he contracted tuberculosis (TB). White and Catlett moved to New York City and also studied together at an arts collective in Mexico City. While in New York City White learned lithography and etching techniques at the Arts Student League, taking direction from renowned artist Harry Sternberg who encouraged him to move beyond ‚Äústylization to individuation in his figures‚Äù. Taking Sternberg advice to heart White would go on to paint The Contribution of the Negro to American Democracy. Printmaking enabled White to reach a wider public more directly and allowed him to bring together his social commitment and artistic practice. Although he had long been aware of art‚Äôs social utility, with his lithographs and linocuts he was finally able to communicate with a large, cross-national community of black workers and socialist artists, as opposed to his paintings, which were generally tied to individual purchasers. He started providing political cartoons for the Daily Worker and, in 1953, he published in association with Masses and Mainstream a portfolio of six reproductions of his ink-and-charcoal drawings, entitled 'Charles White: Six Drawings'. Priced at only $3, this portfolio aimed at getting art to the people, a main concern for progressive artists of the period. In this respect it was a great success, and White himself acknowledged this as he learned that a group of workers in Alabama combined their savings to buy a portfolio and shared the pictures among themselves.John P. Murphy, ‚ÄòCharles White: The Politics of Print‚Äô, Print Quarterly, xxxvi, no. 2, June 2019, pp. 146‚Äì56. In 1956, due to continued breathing problems (perhaps arising from the earlier case of TB), White moved to Los Angeles for its drier, more mild climate. From 1965 to his death in 1979, White taught at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles.Brock, Mary Sherwood, Otis Connections/ LA Printmaking in the 1960s On faculty at Otis, he was a beacon for African American artists who came to study with him. Among those he taught were Alonzo Davis, David Hammons, and Kerry James Marshall. An elementary school was named after him and is located on the former Otis College campus. Later in life White moved to Altadena, California where he remained until his death in 1979. White's best known work is the mural The Contribution of the Negro to American Democracy at Hampton University. Measuring around 12 feet by seven feet, the mural depicts a number of notable African-Americans including Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, Peter Salem, George Washington Carver, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and Marian Anderson. White was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1972. White's works are in the collections of a number of institutions, including Atlanta University, the Barnett Aden Gallery, the Deutsche Academie der Kunste, the Dresden Museum of Art, Howard University, the Library of Congress, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Oakland Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum,Moser, Joann, \\"A Graphic Master: Charles White\\", Eye Level, July 14, 2009. the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Syracuse University and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. The CEJJES Institute of Pomona, New York, owns a number of White's works and has established a dedicated Charles W. White Gallery.\\"The Charles White Gallery\\", The CEJJES Institute.  Legacy  White's popularity faded after his death both because he was a person of color in an industry that unfairly favored white artists and preferred more abstract and conceptual styles in direct opposition to White's style of figurative art. However White popularity and legacy lives on in Altadena California where he spent a great deal of his later years. Shortly after his death a park was re- named after him and it remains today the only park to be named after an American born artist. The Charles White Park hosted an annual event ‚ÄúCharles White Memorial Arts Festival‚Äù which brought African American and local artists into the community until its discontinuation in the 1990s. Currently members of the Altadena Arts council are working with local community and other stake holders to bring the event back to the community. Reception In 1982 a retrospective exhibition of White's work was held at the Studio Museum in Harlem. In the 1990s, the idea of staging a major traveling retrospective exhibition arose. Ultimately, over approximately a ten year period, staff from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Modern Art attempted to locate various White pieces to put together an extensive exhibition of his work. The exhibition opened in Chicago in 2018, traveling to New York City and Los Angeles. White \\"was a humanist, drawn to the physical body and more literal representations of the lives of African-Americans\\", according to Lauren Warnecke for the Chicago Tribune. While this put him out of step with the abstract movement in art, the power of his work is undeniable according to the Los Angeles Times Christopher Knight, especially White's graphic work in graphite, charcoal, crayon and ink. The Washington Post art critic, Philip Kennicott finds White's work central to American art. \\"Grace, passion, coolness, toughness, [and] beauty\\" mark White's work, according to Holland Cotter in The New York Times; White had \\"the hand of an angel\\" and \\"the eye of a sage\\". In November 2019, two works by White went up for the first time in Christie's and Sotheby's main-seasonal New York City contemporary art auctions. Both works, Banner for Willie J. (1976) -- a portrait of White's cousin, who was killed‚Äîand Ye Shall Inherit the Earth (1953) -- a charcoal drawing of civil rights icon Rosa Lee Ingram with a babe-in-arms‚Äîmade sales records for the artist's work.

Marjayoun is a predominantly Christian town about 8km from the border with Israel. The convoy was reportedly attacked with eight to nine IAF bombs as it travelled 30 km northeast of Hasbaya en route to Kefraya in the south of the Bekaa valley. The bombing resulted in the deaths of at least seven people, wounding of at least 36, and the destruction of a number of vehicles. The attacks took place during the 2006 Lebanon War. Timeline of events The convoy had set out on August 11 after the Israeli Army entered the Lebanese army base in Marjayoun on August 10. The IDF took over the base and an evacuation of the Lebanese troops was arranged via UNIFIL. In their press release for August 12, UNIFIL described the sequence of events: > \\"At the request of the Lebanese government, UNIFIL was in contact with the > IDF to facilitate the withdrawal of the Lebanese Joint Security Forces (JSF) > from Marjayoun yesterday. Israeli forces informed UNIFIL that they agree to > such a request. Yesterday afternoon, the JSF convoy (87 vehicles with around > 350 troops, all ranks), which was joined by the Internal Security Forces (10 > vehicles with around 40 troops) and around 100 civilian vehicles, left the > town of Marjayoun.

At around 22.00 hours, the Lebanese authorities informed > UNIFIL that the convoy came under Israeli air strikes in the general area of > Kefraya in the west Beka‚Äôa, and a number of people were killed and wounded. > UNIFIL conveyed this information to the IDF and asked them to immediately > cease attacks on the convoy. At the request of the Lebanese authorities > today, UNIFIL requested the IDF to give security clearance for the convoy to > proceed towards Beirut.\\" The convoy was escorted by two UNIFIL vehicles as far as the town of Hasbaya, 13 km from Marjayoun. The convoy then continued and was reportedly attacked by IDF drones 30 km northeast of Hasbaya. The attack was conducted with nine bombs, Lebanese authorities said. Timeline according to the IDF Immediately after the attack, the IDF reportedly said they were \\"investigating the incident\\". A statement from the IDF was released on 12 August and said that after receiving a request for the convoy to depart, the IDF had denied it. The statement also said that before the attack the IDF had \\"identified suspicious movement along a route forbidden for travel which had been used by Hizbullah to transport rockets and other weaponry.\\" The IDF also stated that they suspected that the movement represented \\"Hizbullah terrorists transporting weaponry.\\" The IDF also said that they were told by UNIFIL after the attacks that the convoy was civilian. The IDF also pointed out that a leaflet drop and announcement had been issued on 7 August, prohibiting the movement of any type of vehicle in all areas south of the Litani River. The limitation took effect at 22:00 on August 7, 2006, and was in force when the attack took place. The attack however occurred north of the Litani close to Kefraya. Medical and humanitarian response An AP photographer with the convoy said that there was an attack on Red Cross and civil defense vehicles coming to the convoy's aid, but that it was unknown if anyone was hurt. The Red Cross also said six civilians died, 32 were wounded, and that a Lebanese Red Cross first-aid volunteer, Mikhael Jbayleh, was also killed at the scene as he tended to the wounded. Reactions UN spokesman Milos Strugar said of the attack: \\"UNIFIL left the convoy at that place [Hasbaya], the Israeli forces had been told in advance of the convoy's passage, and had given it the green light\\". Head of the Lebanese Red Cross's rescue teams, George Kettaneh, said the convoy had been \\"deliberately targeted\\" by the IDF. Lebanese President √âmile Lahoud condemned the IDF attack, saying: \\"the Israeli bombardment of the convoy [took place] despite an agreement negotiated by UNIFIL guaranteeing its safety\\".

Like other block grants, CSBG funds are allocated to the states and other jurisdictions (including tribes, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories) through a formula, with less federal oversight and fewer federal requirements than categorical grants. The CSBG formula determines each jurisdiction's funding level based on poverty population; once disbursed, most of the money is passed by the states and other jurisdictions to CAAs and other designated organizations to be spent on employment, education, income management, housing, nutrition, emergency services, and health.  History  Congress authorized CSBG by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, P.L. 97-35. President Reagan had requested the consolidation of 85 existing anti-poverty grants into seven categorical grants; Congress agreed to consolidate 77 grants into nine. The nine new block grants were budgeted about 25% less than the programs they replaced (Conlan, qtd. in ). The CSBG legislation was amended in 1998 by the Coates Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998, P.L. 105-285.

These are the kinds of programs that President Obama worked with when he was a community organizer, so this cut is not easy for him. Yet for the past 30 years, these grants have been allocated using a formula that does not consider how good a job the recipients are doing. The president is proposing to cut financing for this grant program in half, saving $350 million, and to reform the remaining half into a competitive grant program, so that funds are spent to give communities the most effective help.\\"  See also  *Community Development Block Grant *Community Action Services and Food Bank  References   Bibliography  * Conlan, Timothy J. 1981. \\"Back in Vogue: The Politics of Block Grant Legislation.\\" Intergovernmental Perspective 7(3): 8-15. * Brown, Lawrence David; Fossett, James W.; Palmer, Kenneth T., The Changing Politics of Federal Grants\\", Brookings Institution Press, 1984.

Early life and career Max Freedom Long was born on October 26, 1890, in Sterling, Colorado to Toby Albert Long and his wife Jessie Diffendaffer. At the time of the 1910 census he was working as a photographer in his hometown, and was living in his grandfather's household with his parents. He attended Los Angeles State Normal School from September 1914 to June 1916, and graduated with an Associate of Arts (two-year) degree in general education.Chai, p. 102 After graduating, he worked briefly as an auto-mechanic in Los Angeles. In 1917, Long moved to the island of Hawaii to teach in elementary schools around the big island.Chai, p. 102 He moved to Honolulu in 1920 and lived there until 1932, while he worked in, and later owned, a photography store. In 1920, he married an English woman named Jane Jessie Rae, the proprietor of the Hotel Davenport in Honolulu. When he arrived in Hawaii, he claimed that some Native Hawaiians were practicing what he called magic. Long wrote that at first he was skeptical of this magic, but later became convinced that it worked. He devoted the rest of his life to creating theories about how the Native Hawaiians did what he claimed they did, and teaching those theories through the sale of books and newsletters. In the mid-1930s, Long relocated to Orange County, California and began to focus on writing books inspired by his experiences in Hawaii. He married a second time while in California. Invention of Huna Long decided to call his compilation of teachings Huna, because one meaning of the word is \\"hidden secret\\".Pukui and Ebert Hawaiian Dictionary (University of Hawaii, 1986) He wrote that he derived it from the word kahuna, meaning \\"priests and master craftsmen who ranked near the top of the social scale\\". Long published a series of books on Huna starting in 1936, and founded an organization called the Huna Fellowship in 1945. There are no accepted Hawaiian sources - Malo,David Malo, Hawaiian Antiquities (Bishop Museum, 1951) Kamakau,Samuel Kamakau, The People of Old (Bishop Museum, 1991) 'I'i,John Papa 'I'i, Fragments of Hawaiian History (Bishop Museum, 1959) or KepelinoMartha Beckwith, Kepelino's Traditions of Hawaii (Bishop Museum, 1932)  that refer to the word Huna as a tradition of esoteric learning. Max Freedom Long wrote that he obtained many of his case studies and his ideas about what to look for in kahuna magic from the Director of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, William Brigham. There is no credible evidence that the two men met. Even if they did, Brigham was not an expert on kahunas and did not document in his own writings any of the incidents Long ascribed to him, including walking on hot lava. In his letters and manuscripts, Brigham stated that Hawaiians were \\"an inferior race\\", and implied they were lazy. He referred to Queen Lili'uokalani as a \\"she devil\\", \\"squaw\\", and \\"nigger\\". Native Hawaiian scholar Charles Kenn, a Living Treasure of Hawai'i recognized in the Hawaiian community as a kahuna and expert in Hawaiian history and traditions, was friendly with Max Freedom Long but said, \\"While this Huna study is an interesting study, ‚Ä¶ it is not, and never was Hawaiian.\\" Hawaiian author Pali Jae Lee, a research librarian at the Bishop Museum, conducted extensive research on Max Freedom Long and Huna. She concluded, based on her interviews with Hawaiian elders, \\"Huna is not Hawaiian.\\" Lee cites Theodore Kelsey, a Living Treasure of Hawai'i renowned for his work as a Hawaiian translator, who wrote a letter to Long in 1936 (now in the Hawai'i State Archives) criticizing his use of the terms \\"unihipili\\" and \\"aumakua\\". Professor Lisa Kahaleole Hall writes that Huna \\"bears absolutely no resemblance to any Hawaiian worldview or spiritual practice\\" and calls it part of the \\"New Age spiritual industry\\". Huna books have been called \\"examples of cultural appropriation\\". Later life Max Freedom Long stopped issuing bulletins in late 1970 due to poor health. He died at his home in Vista, California on September 23, 1971 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to his head. He had been suffering from a bone cancer for a few years at that time, and was in constant pain in his final months. He was a believer in voluntary euthanasia. Max Freedom Long Library and Museum Prior to his death, Long's papers and library became part of the Max Freedom Long Library and Museum at the Huna Research Center at Fort Worth, Texas. It was established by a student named Dolly Ware, who inherited Long's library. After Dolly Ware's death in 2012, parts of the collection were sold to antiquarian book dealers. Other parts became the possession of E. Otha Wingo, who was a direct successor of Long's Huna tradition. Parts of the collection of the original Library and Museum have since been reconstituted at Valdosta State University's Archives and Special Collections as part of their New Age Movements, Occultism, and Spiritualism Research Library. The remaining pieces are being sought by the curator of the collection, Guy Frost of Valdosta State University's Odum Library.

She is best known as a researcher into the teaching of literature. Biography Rosenblatt was born in Atlantic City to Jewish immigrant parents. She attended Barnard College, the women's college at Columbia University in New York City, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1925.Joe Holley, Louise Rosenblatt at 100, a Scholar of Reading, Author (Washington Post, 20 February 2005), reprinted in the Boston Globe, 20 February 2005 Her roommate was Margaret Mead, the anthropologist, who urged her to study anthropology. A year behind Mead at Barnard, Rosenblatt took over her position as editor-in-chief of the Barnard Bulletin.Gordon M. Pradl, \\"Reading Literature in a Democracy: The Challenge of Louise Rosenblatt.\\" In Clifford, The Experience of Reading While Rosenblatt initially planned to travel to Samoa after graduation in order to do field research, she decided instead to continue her studies in France. In Paris, she met French author Andr√© Gide and American expatriates Gertrude Stein and Robert Penn Warren. Rosenblatt obtained a Certitude d'etudes Fran√ßaises from the University of Grenoble in 1926. She continued her studies in Paris, receiving a PhD in Comparative Literature from the Sorbonne in 1931. That same year she married Sidney Ratner, a professor at Rutgers University. Rosenblatt published her first book in 1931. It was written in French and examined the \\"art for art's sake\\" movement that had stirred England in the latter portion of the nineteenth century. Rosenblatt was enrolled as an instructor at Barnard College in 1931, and remained on the college's rolls through 1938. In 1938 she transferred to Brooklyn College, and remained on that college's rolls through 1948. In 1948 she became a Professor of English Education at New York University's School of Education, where she remained until her retirement in 1972. Subsequently, she held visiting professorships at Rutgers and the University of Miami, along with a number of other short term appointments, although she maintained residence at her long-term home in Princeton, New Jersey. In 2002 she moved to Arlington, Virginia, to live with her son Jonathan. She died of congestive heart failure at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington on 8 February 2005. During World War II Rosenblatt worked for the United States Office of War Information, analyzing reports concerning or coming from France, which at that time was controlled by the Germans. Throughout her life, Rosenblatt was consistently involved in political activism. Carrying on a tradition from her family championing the \\"underdog,\\" her editorials in the Barnard Bulletin spoke to her concern for building democratic institutions. She was a strong supporter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), her socialist instincts led her to support Norman Thomas, before moving to FDR in the 1930s, and later in the 1990s and 2000s, she wrote her representatives often to effect policy changes, especially in relation to the No Child Left Behind Act. Research and contributions When Rosenblatt began teaching English Literature at Barnard, she developed an intense interest in each reader's unique response to a given text. Her views regarding literacy were influenced by John Dewey,Jeanne M. Connell, Continue to Explore: In Memory of Louise Rosenblatt (Education and Culture, 21.2) who was in the philosophy department at Columbia in the 1930s, as well as Charles Sanders Peirce and William James. She is best known for her two influential texts: Literature as Exploration (1938) was originally completed for the Commission on Human Relations and was a publication of the Progressive Education Association (it subsequently went through 5 editions); The Reader, The Text, The Poem: The Transactional Theory of the Literary Work (1978), in which she argues that the act of reading literature involves a transaction (Dewey's term) between the reader and the text. She argued that the meaning of any text lay not in the work itself but in the reader's transaction with it, whether it was a play by Shakespeare or a novel by Toni Morrison. Her work made her a well-known reader-response theorist. In her view, each \\"transaction\\" is a unique experience in which the reader and text continuously act and are acted upon by each other. A written work (often referred to as a \\"poem\\" in her writing) does not have the same meaning for everyone, as each reader brings individual background knowledge, beliefs, and context into the reading act. Rosenblatt's idea of the reading process, however, does not lead to all readings being equally accurate. For the reader's part, he or she must pay close attention to every detail of the text and pay equal attention to his or her own responses. This process exemplifies not only reader-response criticism but also close reading. This inclusion of Rosenblatt's \\"transactional\\" theory within the designation \\"reader-response,\\" however, needs to be contested. Rosenblatt herself contended that she was never propounding a view of reading centered on isolated, individual readers as was the case with \\"reception theory.\\" Instead, the focus of her thinking throughout her long career was on how individuals came to negotiate their readings in social terms. Such an ongoing conversation between reader(s) and text(s) was her way of emphasizing the importance of literature for human development in democratic settings.See for instance, Gordon M. Pradl, Literature for Democracy: Reading As a Social Act, Chapters 9 & 10. As part of her \\"transactional\\" theory, Rosenblatt distinguished between two kinds of reading, or \\"stances,\\" which she viewed on a continuum between \\"efferent\\" and \\"aesthetic.\\" Anchoring one end is Efferent reading, the most common kind, in which the reader seeks to derive information from the text. In this instance, a reader is concerned mainly or totally with the gist, the message, the information, he or she can \\"carry away,\\" which is what \\"efferent\\" means, conducting away. Such a reader does not care about how the text is worded. In contrast, if a reader approaches a text seeking to enjoy its formal characteristics‚Äîits rhythms, its word choices, its images, its connotations‚Äîthen that person is reading \\"aesthetically.\\" Such a reader hopes to participate in an aesthetic experience, much like listening to a great musical composition or viewing a beautiful painting. That is what \\"aesthetic\\" means, perceiving something beautiful. Rosenblatt, however, was never just interested in formalism or \\"beauty\\" in any rarified sense. She was more concerned with the nuts and bolts of language cognition, citing people like Elizabeth Bates and Ragnar Rommetveit, which led her to emphasize the role of the interpretant in mediating between signified and signifier, or between sign and referent (Peirce's triadic model). The individual reader therefore has to draw upon personal experiences in order to infuse aesthetic significance to a word and by extension, a set of words, such as in a poem. In aesthetic reading the emphasis is more on the journey experienced, which reveals her debt to Romanticism and its emphasis on the sensuous, on the emotions. Aesthetic reading would also help individual readers to grow in self-reflection and self-criticism, working out why they evoked a literary work the way they did, and that this would spur them to talk to others about their experiences with the same text. It is precisely this social behavior of the individual reader that placed Rosenblatt's thinking in the realm of democracy.

Alijah Billington Billington inherits Richard Billington's estate in the early 19th century. He enters into a rivalry with Reverend Ward Phillips, who accused Billington and his forebear of practicing sorcery. The feud culminated with the disappearance of John Druven, one of Phillips' supporters. Afterwards, Billington leaves for England with his son Laban and his servant Quamis, remaining there until his death. Ward Phillips Reverend of the Second Church (later First Baptist Church) of Arkham. In 1805, he became the librarian at Miskatonic University. He is chiefly known for his book Thaumaturgical Prodigies in the New-English Canaan. When Alijah Billington found out that the book accused his ancestor of practicing sorcery, he started a feud with Phillips, which lasted several months. Shortly after one of his proponents, John Druven, disappeared, Phillips seemingly had a change of heart and began buying and burning every copy of his book that he could lay his hands on. The name is an homage to Howard Phillips Lovecraft. A character of the same name appears in Lovecraft's \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\". John Druven An occasional correspondent for the Arkham Gazette and a friend of Ward Phillips. He disappeared after accepting an invitation from Alijah Billington to investigate strange noises emanating from Billington's Wood. Ambrose Dewart (approximately 1870-1924) A descendant of Laban Billington who comes to Arkham in 1921 to reclaim his family's property which had been abandoned for roughly a century. He is described as \\"a hawk-faced man of medium height, chiefly distinguished for a flare of red hair which gave him a tonsured appearance, keen of eye and tight of lip, exceedingly correct and possessed of a dry sort of humor... a man of some fifty years of age, brown-skinned, who had lost his only son in the great war.\\"Lovecraft and Derleth, pp 5-6. Locals blame him for a subsequent series of unexplainable disappearances in the area. He disappeared in 1924. Seneca Lapham A professor of anthropology at Miskatonic University and a graduate of the same institution (class of 1879).

Gad was the name of the pan-Semitic god of fortune, usually depicted as a male but sometimes as a female. and is attested in ancient records of Aram and Arabia. Gad is also mentioned in the bible as a deity in the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 65:11 ‚Äì some translations simply call him (the god of) Fortune), as having been worshipped by a number of Hebrews during the babylonian captivity. Gad apparently differed from the god of destiny, who was known as Meni. The root verb in Gad means cut or divide, and from this comes the idea of fate being meted out.  Israelite connection  It is possible that the son of Jacob named Gad is named after Gad, or that gad is a theophoric name, or descriptive. Although the text presents a different reason, the (ketub) quotation of Zilpa (Gad's mother) giving the reason of Gad's name could be understood that way. How widespread the cult of Gad, the deity, was in Canaanite times may be inferred from the names Baalgad, a city at the foot of Mount Hermon, and Migdal-gad, in the territory of Judah. Compare also the proper names Gaddi and Gaddiel in the tribes of Manasseh and Zebulun (Numbers 13:10, 11). At the same time it must not be supposed that Gad was always regarded as an independent deity. The name was doubtless originally an appellative, meaning the power that allots. Hence any of the greater gods supposed to favour men might be thought of as the giver of good fortune and be worshiped under that title; it is possible that Jupiter, the planet, may have been the Gad thus honoured - among the Arabs the planet Jupiter was called the greater Fortune (Venus was styled the lesser Fortune). Gad is the patron of a locality, a mountain (Kodashim, tractate Hullin 40a), of an idol (Genesis Rabbah, lxiv), a house, or the world (Genesis Rabbah, lxxi.). Hence \\"luck\\" may also be bad (Ecclesiastes Rabbah, vii. 26). A couch or bed for this god of fortune is referred to in the Mishnaic tractate Nedarim 56a).

He was the only surviving son of industrialist Peter Cooper. Early life Cooper was born in New York City on October 26, 1824. He was the son of Peter Cooper (1791‚Äì1883) and Sarah Raynor (n√©e Bedell) Cooper (1793‚Äì1869). His sister Amelia Cooper (1830‚Äì1912) was married to Abram Stevens Hewitt (1822‚Äì1903), who also served as mayor of New York from 1887 to 1888. He was the grandson of John O. Cooper (1755‚Äì1838), a hatmaker who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and Margaret Campbell (1762‚Äì1841). He attended the New York public schools and Columbia College, afterwards entering the iron business with the aid of his father. He completed his studies in 1842 and in 1845, Columbia awarded him the honorary degree of Master of Arts. Career In partnership with Abram S. Hewitt, Cooper operated an iron works in Trenton, New Jersey. Edward Cooper also became a metallurgist and inventor, developing several improvements to iron making and metalworking. He declined to patent his inventions, believing that they could better serve the public if he made them widely available. After Peter Cooper's death in 1883, Edward Cooper succeeded to the presidency of the Cooper Union.\\"First Annual Report of the Trustees of Cooper Union\\" (January 1, 1860) Active in politics as a Democrat, Cooper was a delegate to The 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, and the 1876 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis. With Hewitt, Samuel J. Tilden and others, Cooper was recognized as a leader of the Swallowtails, named for the Swallowtail coat. The Swallowtails were prominent Democratic businessmen and professionals who opposed the Tammany Hall Democratic organization and attempted to introduce government reforms and end corruption. Cooper served as a member of the Committee of Seventy, which investigated and prosecuted Tammany Hall corruption. In 1875, Tilden was Governor of New York, and named Cooper to a commission which proposed anti-corruption reforms for inclusion in the New York Constitution. By the late 1870s, Cooper was part of the Irving Hall Democrats, another organization which opposed Tammany. In 1878, Cooper ran successfully for mayor, supported by anti-Tammany Democrats, Republicans, and independents. He defeated Augustus Schell, who ran with Tammany support. During his two-year term Cooper promoted reform of the city's sanitation service and tenement laws. He was succeeded by William Russell Grace, another anti-Tammany Democrat. In 1890, Abram S. Hewitt partnered with Edward Cooper and Hamilton M. Twombly in forming the American Sulphur Company. That company then entered into a 50/50 agreement with Herman Frasch and his partners to form the Union Sulphur Company Society life In 1892, Cooper and his wife were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Personal life In 1854, Cooper was married to Cornelia Redmond (1829‚Äì1894), the daughter of James Morton Redmond and Anne (n√©e Bowne) Redmond. Together, they were the parents of two children, only one of whom lived to maturity: * Edith Cooper (1854‚Äì1916),, page 8 who married Lloyd Stephens Bryce, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, in 1879.

Corey Yuen serves as the film's fight choreographer. This was Kelvin Wong's final film appearance, who retired from acting, until his death 15 years later of liver cancer. The film is a parody of some of Hollywood's most influential action films, such as Die Hard and Speed. It also gained controversy for spoofing Jackie Chan, who was, in turn, offended by the satire. Plot Kit Li, a cop on the Hong Kong Police bomb squad, responds to a call at a local school, where a terrorist group led by an individual calling himself \\"The Doctor\\" has taken a school bus hostage. He soon discovers his wife and son are on board the explosives-rigged bus. Kit sends a subordinate to disarm the bomb, but matters are complicated due to the intricate setup of the bomb, which eventually explodes, killing everyone on the bus, including Kit's family. In the aftermath, Kit leaves the force and serves as a stunt double for martial arts action star Frankie Lone. However, Helen, a tabloid reporter, films one of his stunts and thus discovers Lone's duplicity, using it to boost her show's ratings. At a wrap party for Frankie's film, Frankie's father and his manager invite Kit to a jewelry exhibition at the newly opened Hotel Grandeur, but the Doctor also targets the exhibition. At a traffic stop, Kit overhears the Doctor uttering a catchphrase that he used during the school bus bombing, and realizing the Doctor's identity, he follows the car back to the Hotel Grandeur, but is unable to convince the hotel manager of the impending threat. At a nearby police station, only Detective Kam Chow and a desk sergeant believe him. The Doctor and his team take over the building, take the guests hostage, and initiate a massacre. Kit and Chow return, only to find themselves ambushed by the Doctor's gang members in a shootout, during which Chow is injured. Frankie manages to escape and runs into Fai, who pretends to be a helpless damsel in distress, leading him right to her partner, Kong. It is revealed that Kong is obsessed with beating Frankie in combat. Frankie runs away after encountering Kong. Kit and Chow thin out the Doctor's numbers after driving the car out of the freight elevator. Frankie's father wrestles a weapon away from a terrorist and threatens the hacker trying to deactivate the exhibit's security measures. Chow is reunited with his girlfriend Joyce. Kit tries to kill the Doctor in revenge when the villain mocks him, but the attempt tips the scales back in the terrorists' favor. Kit, Helen and Frankie's father barely manage to escape. Helen runs into a room with an exhibit of poisonous reptiles, places the videotape underneath a display case and hides in the men's washroom. The Doctor's younger brother, Rabbit, throws some of the snakes into the bathroom, poisoning her in the process. Kit and the Lones rescue Helen, administering anti-venom serum, and Kit learns that Helen managed to record the Doctor's face in her footage. Meanwhile, the Doctor warns the police that if they do not meet his impossible demands, he will toss a hostage out the window every ten minutes, with Frankie's manager Charlie Tso as the first victim. Kit retrieves the tape, and successfully kills Rabbit before escaping a grenade blast and landing in police custody. The police refuse to let Kit go back into the hotel, so Kit forces the desk sergeant he encountered earlier to let him return via helicopter at gunpoint. The Lones meet Fai and Kong in the midst of an argument that has escalated into a fight. The Lones intervene, unaware of Fai's true colors, until she holds them at gunpoint. Fai is about to murder Chow, but Chow seizes her gun and shoots her dead. Kong attacks Frankie's entourage; but when he begins punching Frankie's father, Frankie retaliates and kills Kong. The Doctor intercepts a police transmission and sends his men to ambush the helicopter. Helen manages to warn Kit, who rams the helicopter into the building. In the resulting chaos everyone escapes, but the Doctor captures Helen and takes her to the roof. Kit finds Helen with a bomb strapped to her, and the Doctor taunts him to choose between taking revenge on him or saving the life of another loved one. Kit throws a knife, hitting the Doctor in the shoulder before the latter escapes. Kit finds out that the wiring is the same as the last bomb, and this time successfully defuses it. During the defusal, he gets a call from the Doctor. Kit informs the Doctor that the dagger he threw was coated with snake venom from Helen's wound. He ironically uses the same catchphrase the Doctor used before: \\"No risk, no reward.\\" The Doctor eventually dies in agony and his body is looted by teenagers. Frankie decides to use the incident as the basis for his new movie, while crediting everyone for their heroics. Kit, however, leaves with Helen, who expresses her gratitude with an announcement of wishing to marry him. Cast * Jet Li as Kit Li - Kit used to work for the police, but left the force after losing his wife and son in a bomb threat he thought he had defused. He later became the personal body guard of Frankie and would even perform stunts for him when Frankie was inebriated. He is an expert martial artist and fights most of the major villains throughout most of the film. * Jacky Cheung as Frankie Lone, a famous and popular action movie star famous for doing all of his own stunts. In reality, he is very lazy and lecherous. His character is assumed to be a spoof of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee; he even wears Lee's iconic yellow jump suit from Game of Death. * Kelvin Wong as The Doctor * Valerie Chow as Fai- fai, the Doctor's partner * Billy Chow as Kong, one of the Doctor's henchmen. He is obsessed with Frankie Lone, even to the point of fantasizing about defeating him in a fight. * Chingmy Yau as Helen Vu * Charlie Yeung as Joyce, one of the women working at the Hotel Grandeur.

The movie takes a cinematic swipe at Jackie Chan, with whom director Wong Jing had worked previously on the City Hunter live-action film. After the release of City Hunter, Chan not only disowned the film, but attacked Wong personally in the press. Through the character of Frankie Lone, Wong insinuated that Chan was actually a boozing womanizer and a fraud who did not really do his own stunts after all.

These acids are highly reactive but the cyclopropene ring is destroyed during refining and hydrogenation of the oils. They have attracted interest because they reduce levels of the enzyme stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase (SCD), which catalyzes the biodesaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid.

Accessed June 3, 2014. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/overbelief. for a belief adopted that requires more evidence than one presently has. It is also described as a kind of metaphysical belief ascribed with the status of speculative view that exceeds available evidence or evidencing reason. Generally, acts of overbelief are justified on emotional need or faith, and a need to make sense of spiritual experience, rather than on empirical evidence. This idea originates from the works of William James in The Varieties of Religious ExperienceThe Varieties of Religious Experience online text and refers to the conceptual framework that individuals have.  Concept  In overbelief, James explained the role of human temperament in philosophy, particularly how it creates a bias on the part of a philosopher that could be stronger than any of his more objective premises. James maintained that overbelief is based on temperament instead of objective evidence or universal reason. He stressed, however, that overbelief is qualified in the sense that it is provisional and that one's own overbelief is valid on account of the diversity of human consciousness and that the different experiences all have meaning. This idea underpins James argument concerning the validity of religion, showing its connection with the scientific understanding of psychology. He has established overbelief as a way of understanding how individuals and cultures systematically interpret faith experiences. The concept was also treated as the basis of the strong inclination or the parti pris that allows the faithful to resist the onslaught of hostile facts against their beliefs. According to James, a typical example of an overbelief would be R. W. Trine's contention that \\"The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and through all.\\" James acknowledges that his own over-beliefs are so minimal that to some religious believers they may seem like \\"under-beliefs\\".

Background The village of Maraga (Leninavan) was located in the Martakert region of Nagorno Karabakh, just across the border from the Azerbaijani town of Tartar (also known as Terter and Mir-Bashir) and was one of the region's largest villages. According to the census of 1989 the village had a population of 4660, predominantly ethnic Armenians including a few Armenian families who escaped pogroms but were forcefully deported from Sumgait, Baku, and other areas of Soviet Azerbaijan. By spring 1992 the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh escalated. Azerbaijan tightened the blockade which it had imposed on Nagorno-Karabakh for about two years, at the same time employing policy of ethnic cleansing and military assaults against the Armenians in Karabakh. The bordering villages of Karabakh were systematically raided and shelled by Azerbaijani armed forces.Bloodshed in the Caucasus: escalation of the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh. 1992 Attack on the village On April 10, 1992 Maraga was attacked by the Azerbaijani forces. Early in the morning artillery fire started, followed by a ground assault from neighboring Mir-Bashir. By the afternoon, Azerbaijan's regular army forces entered the village with tanks, followed by infantry, and followed by looters. By that time according to the data of Human Rights Watch the village had 500 residents. As the result of the attack most of the village was burnt and destroyed, 57 residents of the village were killed, 45 civilians were taken hostages including men, women and children. A preliminary investigation was carried out by Human Rights Watch (HRW, Helsinki Watch) and published in 1992. Having spoken to the only eyewitness available to them at the time, an Armenian fighter who took part in the village's defense, the report outlined that Maraga's defense detachments were unable to hold their positions when units of the Azerbaijani army attacked the village on April 10: they retreated to a spot overlooking the village and called for help. According to Armenian fighters, the Azerbaijanis had about 20 armored vehicles, and the lack of adequate weaponry on the Armenian side made it impossible for them to repel the attack. The defending units notified the villagers of their retreat and most of the inhabitants left the village, while the civilians who remained, mainly consisting of the elderly and the disabled, hid in basements and underground shelters. Two weeks later the Azerbaijani forces launched another attack on the village. 13 civilians were taken hostage, and the remaining population was then forcibly deported. The whole village was then razed to the ground. Massacre and atrocities The Azerbaijani army captured Maraga the same day (April 10) and massacred the civilian population. The village was retaken by the Armenians the next day. The Armenian fighters reported finding the bodies of 43 civilians, most of whom were mutilated. The massacre was marked by extreme acts of cruelty and slaughter. Azeri soldiers sawed off the heads of 45 villagers, burnt others, took 100 women and children away as hostages, looted and set fire to all the homes, and left with all the pickings from the looting. According to eyewitness accounts people were decapitated, tortured (such as being dragged tied to a tank or being burnt alive), bodies were mutilated, dissected and burnt; non-combatants, among them men, women and children, were captured and taken hostage.Amnesty International. \\"Country Dossier List 1993 Europe. \\"Unofficial sources report that ethnic Armenians Liana and Ulyana Barsegyan were detained on April 10, 1992 when Azerbaydzhani forces entered the village where they lived (Maraga) in the disputed region of Karabakh.

Aftermath The Azerbaijani officers directly involved in the massacre were never held responsible or tried for the crimes they committed in Maraga. At the same time the Azerbaijani side has not responded to the accusations of Maraga massacre. The events in Maraga were not covered by international media and there is little awareness in the world about the events in this village, despite the severity of the actions. Cox explained that she hadn't brought journalists together with her to Maraga on those days because it was dangerous, but she made many photographs which are printed in her book Ethnic Cleansing in Progress. Cox also said in her interview that English newspaper Daily Telegraph had agreed to print her report on Maraga massacre but then they refused to do so. Maraga village is currently controlled by the Azerbaijani army. The former residents of the village now live in Russia, Armenia and other parts of Nagorno-Karabakh. Those living in Russia are unable to return to Karabakh because of the lack of funds to cover travel expenses. The residents of Maraga who stayed in Karabakh have rebuilt another village on the ruins of another village in Nagorno-Karabakh, not far from Maraga. This new village is now called Nor Maraga (New Maraga). There has been a monument erected in New Maraga commemorating the victims of the massacre.

Reynolds (fall 1799 ‚Äì August 25, 1858), also known as J. N. Reynolds, was an American newspaper editor, lecturer, explorer and author who became an influential advocate for scientific expeditions. His lectures on the possibility of a hollow Earth appear to have influenced Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) and his 1839 account of the whale Mocha Dick, Mocha Dick: Or the White Whale of the Pacific, influenced Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851). Mocha Dick, The White Whale of the Pacific, by Jeremiah N. Reynolds, 1932 cover, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. Illustrations by Lowell LeRoy Balcom. Early life Born into poverty in Cumberland County Pennsylvania, he moved to Ohio as a child. In his teenage years and early 20s, he did farm labor, taught school, saved his money, and attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio for three years. He then edited the Spectator newspaper in Wilmington, Ohio, but sold his interest in it in about 1823. Web page titled, \\"The Romantic History of Jeremiah N. Reynolds\\" at the \\"American Studies at the University of Virginia\\" Web site, accessed August 12, 2006 The next year, Reynolds began a lecture tour with John Cleves Symmes Jr.. Reynolds had become a convert to Symmes' theory that the earth is hollow. Symmes' idea was accepted as possible by some respected scientists of the time.Philbrick, Nathaniel, Sea of Glory, pages 19-20, Hereafter: Sea of Glory The two presented talks on the subject. When Symmes died, Reynolds continued his lectures, which were given to full houses in Eastern U.S. cities (with a charge of 50 cents for admission). Over time, Reynolds became willing to accept the possibility that the theory was wrong. In Philadelphia, Reynolds and Symmes parted.Sea of Glory, page 20 Adventures Gaining the support of members of President John Quincy Adams' cabinet, and speaking before Congress, Reynolds succeeded in fitting out a national expedition to the South Pole. However, Andrew Jackson opposed the project, and after he became president it was squelched. Reynolds garnered support from private sources and the expedition sailed from New York City in 1829. Encountering much danger, the expedition reached the Antarctic shore and returned north, but at Valpara√≠so, Chile, the crew mutinied. They set Reynolds and the artist John Frampton Watson on shore, where they tramped for the next two years. In 1832, the United States frigate Potomac, under Commodore John Downes, arrived. The ship had been ordered to the coast of Sumatra to avenge an attack on an American ship, Friendship, of Salem, Massachusetts, and was returning home in what became a circumnavigation of the globe. Reynolds joined Downes as his private secretary for the trip and wrote a book about the experience. Later life Back in New York City, Reynolds studied law and became a success as an advocate. In 1848 he organized a stock company in New York City for a New Mexico mining operation. Reynolds missed joining the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838‚Äì1842, even though that venture was a result of his agitation. He did not participate because he had offended too many in his call for such a trip. His health broke down and on August 25, 1858, at the age of 59, he died suddenly while visiting St. Catharine Springs, Canada. Influence Edgar Allan Poe was influenced by \\"Address on the Subject of a Surveying and Exploring Expedition to the Pacific Ocean and the South Seas\\" (1836). The Southern Literary Messenger, February, 1837, containing the second installment of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. In the January 1837 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger, Edgar Allan Poe reviewed Reynolds' \\"Address, on the Subject of a Surveying and Exploring Expedition to the Pacific Ocean and South Seas (New York, 1836) first given to the House of Representatives on April 2, 1836\\".pp. 68-72 quod.lib.umich.edu \\"Poe used some seven hundred words of Reynolds' Address in the fifteen hundred words of Chapter XVI of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\", wrote Daniel Tynan of the Colorado College in an article about the Poe text, adding a synopsis of \\"sections from Chapter IV of Reynolds' Voyage and Chapter XIV of Pym, indicating to what extent Poe borrowed from Reynolds' book for his own purposes\\". Web page titled: \\"Text: Daniel J. Tynan, 'J. N. Reynold's Voyage of the Potomac: Another Source for The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,' from Poe Studies, vol. IV, no. 2, December 1971, pp. 35‚Äì37.\\" From the Web site of the Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore, accessed August 12, 2006. Tynan's assumption, however, that the \\"Mr. Reynolds\\" Poe praised (actually not in January 1837 in the SLM but only in September 1843 in Graham's Magazine, Vol. XXIV No. 3 p. 165 books.google) as \\"the prime mover of this important undertaking\\", the United States Exploring Expedition, can be identified with Jeremiah N. Reynolds seems more than doubtful.

The series was created by the team of Barry Fanaro, Mort Nathan, Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman. Synopsis Pacific Station centered around Detective Bob Ballard (Robert Guillaume), a wisecracking veteran cop who had been assigned to Pacific Station in Venice, California, apparently usually a dumping ground for eccentric and/or incompetent officers. Even more eccentric were the suspects the officers of Pacific Station brought in, as many were from nearby Venice Beach, a celebratedly off-center locale. The other officers of Pacific Station included Detective Richard Capparelli (Richard Libertini), fresh from treatment for his psychological problems, Detective Sandy Calloway (Megan Gallagher), and the brown-nosing Detective Al Burkhardt (Ron Leibman). In command of this hodgepodge was the recently promoted, immature, mother-fixated Captain Ken Epstein (Joel Murray), who had received the place which logic dictated should have gone to Bob. Frequently blustering his way through the station was Deputy Commissioner Hank Bishop (John Hancock), who never let anyone forget for a moment that he was a deputy commissioner. Richard Libertini had just recently worked with creators/producers Fanaro, Nathan, Speer and Grossman on NBC's The Fanelli Boys the previous season. Cast *Robert Guillaume as Det. Bob Ballard *Richard Libertini as Det. Richard Capparelli *Megan Gallagher as Det. Sandy Calloway *Ron Leibman as Det. Al Burkhardt *Joel Murray as Capt. Ken Epstein *John Hancock as Dep. Commissioner Hank Bishop Scheduling Pacific Station did not garner solid ratings, due to competition from ABC's America's Funniest People and CBS's Murder, She Wrote. It was put on hiatus in October 1991. Brought back in a new time slot in December, it was permanently cancelled in January 1992. Title Sequence The opening theme for Pacific Station was an in-house cover of Fontella Bass' \\"Rescue Me\\". The sequence began with shots of Venice Beach attractions, followed by the view of a police truck driving into the parking lot of the station as the title appeared on-screen. This proceeded into more videotaped scenes of the show and cast.

The armoury is the home base of 36 Signal Regiment, The Princess Louise Fusiliers, and several other reserve units. Architecture Toronto Armoury, demolished 1963 The armoury was designed in 1895 by Chief Dominion Architect Thomas Fuller, and was opened the next year and work on the structure was completed in 1899. While the sandstone exterior is based on a medieval castle, it was actually one of the most advanced structures of its day. It was pioneering in its use of a series of Fink trusses to create a large interior space with no columns or walls, and is today the oldest surviving example of such a building. It was also one of the first buildings in Halifax to be lit by electricity. The plan is similar to that of Fuller's Toronto Armoury, completed in 1894. History It has played an important part in many Canadian wars, being an important transit point for soldiers before departing by ship for the Boer War and both World Wars. It was damaged in the Halifax Explosion in 1917, the west wall being displaced by about 60 centimetres.Staff, \\"North Park Armoury gets permanent fix 100 years after Halifax Explosion,\\" Chronicle Herald (Halifax), January 25, 2017. Retrieved 3 February 2017 Still usable after the explosion, the armoury provided shelter for many who had lost their homes. The armoury again served as an emergency shelter during the 1945 Bedford Magazine explosions, when thousands of North End residents evacuated toward the Halifax Common. The St. John Ambulance Brigade and the army worked together to shelter the evacuees for about 25 hours following the first explosion. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1989. In 1991, it was designated a Classified Federal Heritage Building. Restoration Major renovations were announced in January 2017 to restore the west wall to its original position after being damaged in 1917 by the powerful blast of the Halifax Explosion. Up to 20 per cent of the wall required replacement and it was decided to use stone from the original quarry after the source was located in Beckwith, near Pugwash, Nova Scotia.Anne Farries, \\"Group goes on stone treasure hunt for North Park Armoury rehab project,\\" Chronicle Herald (Halifax), January 27, 2017. Retrieved 3 February 2017 First phase The first phase of the rehabilitation project centres on restoring the damaged west wall, as a tilt caused by the Halifax Explosion has gradually been increasing. Reconstruction of the wall is expected to be complete in October 2019. Second phase The restoration's second phase is expected to be complete by 2024. The interior will be restored, as will the other three facades as well as the building's roof.

His debut recording Thunder Chicken, produced by Dan Prothero, has been referred to as \\"one of the few truly wild and unruly records to come from the rock & roll tradition in the 21st century\\". Biography While still in grade school, he was conning his cousin to take him into the French Quarter so he could buy every element of Brian Jones's outfit from the front cover of The Rolling Stones High Tides & Green Grass. He had taken up the guitar at age four, and was learning to play rock and blues by the time he was eleven. At the age of twelve he witnessed The Meters performing on the back of a flatbed truck in New Orleans on Mardi Gras Day. This would influence the young musician. John Campbell took him under his wing when Welbourne was 14, and around that time he started taking the blues seriously. By the time he was 17, he had left home and was hitch hiking around the south, playing guitar on the streets for passing change, playing in juke joints, forming short-lived bands or backing up blues and soul singers. A trip to Jamaica in 1977 exposed him to reggae music, and a few years later he teamed up with Michael E. Johnson and formed The Killer Bees in 1980. They continued to play for many years, eventually becoming one of the first American bands to perform at Reggae Sunsplash in Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1988. Earlier, while on tour with Burning Spear aka Winston Rodney and his band, he received the nickname, Papa Mali from the reggae pioneers. By the time the Killer Bees disbanded, Papa Mali went solo. Upon the release of his debut album Thunder Chicken he remarked that for the first time in his adult life, he was finally able to reflect warmly on the years growing up in Shreveport. In 2007, he released the follow- up, Do Your Thing, also on the Fog City imprint and produced by Dan Prothero. The album included work by Big Chief Monk Boudreaux and the Golden Eagles Mardi Gras Indians, Kirk Joseph, and Henry Butler. By now, Papa Mali was performing at many of the top festivals in the U.S. and abroad. On New Year's Eve of 2008/2009 Papa Mali, Matt Hubbard and former Neville Brothers bassist James \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson performed with Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann in concert at the Pauela Cannery in Haiku-Pauwela, Hawaii. In 2009 he formed a new band, 7 Walkers along with Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann, The Meters bassist George Porter Jr. (initially with bassist Reed Mathis) and multi-instrumentalist, Matt Hubbard. Their self-titled debut was released on November 2, 2010 on Response Records. The songs were co-written by Papa Mali and Robert Hunter. One of these songs, \\"King Cotton Blues\\", featured a duet by Papa Mali and Willie Nelson. The record was recorded in Austin, and produced by Papa Mali. Papa Mali's latest album is Music is Love, released in 2015 is produced by veteran roots producer John Chelew on the 429 Records label. Music is Love features drummer Johnny Vidacovich, Bassist Casandra Faulconer and features Mike Dillon and Dave Easley on backing vocals.

Design The designer is unknown but may have been the Dublin architect John Smyth. It has a Palladian design with a central Venetian window and doric pilasters and is similar to that built by Lord Burlington for General Wade (now demolished) in London in the 1830s, who in turn copied a drawing by Andrea Palladio. Another version of the house existed in Potsdam. The ground floor ashlar stonework is heavily tooled with round-headed arches spanning over the windows. The centre arch over the entrance door is slightly wider than the others. The upper floor consists of pilasters standing on a string course and supporting a strong cornice at roof level. The two wings are both similar with a three-bay breakfront surmounted by a pediment. It is the only one of Dublin's great Georgian houses which still serves its original purpose. It lies at the north end of Grafton Street near the corner with Nassau Street and has the unique address of No 1 Grafton Street. Henry Keene may have designed the interior. Metalwork may have been by Timothy Turner. It was described by Charles Robert Cockerell in 1823 as follows: \\"The beautiful front of the Provost's House,...... had been completely spoilt by a high pitched roof and the centre arch having keystone smaller than the sides, producing a disfigured visual effect.\\" Other usage In 2017 the house was used as a neutral venue for negotiations between Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael as part of Irish government formation talks.

He is known for his contributions to the Washington, D.C. art scene in the 1980s, and for openly discussing the topics pertinent to the African-American gay community. Biography  Early life  Essex Hemphill was born April 16, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois, to Warren and Mantalene Hemphill, and was the second eldest of five children. Early in his life, he moved to Washington D.C. where he attended Ballou High School. He began writing poetry at the age of fourteen, writing about his own thoughts, family life, and budding sexuality. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Maryland in 1975 to study journalism. Though he left college after his freshman year, he continued to interact with the D.C. art scene: performing spoken word, working on journals, and beginning to publish his first poetry chapbooks. He would go on to achieve his degree in English at the University of the District of Columbia.Dickel, Simon. Hemphill, Essex. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford African American Studies Center.  Career  In 1979, Hemphill and his colleagues started the Nethula Journal of Contemporary Literature, a publication aimed at showcasing the works of modern black artists.Steward, Douglas. \\"Essex Hemphill (1957-1995).\\" Contemporary Gay American Poets & Playwrights. Ed. Emmanuel S. Nelson. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2003, pp. 198‚Äì204. One of his first public readings was arranged by Nethula co-editor E. Ethelbert Miller at Howard University‚Äôs Founder Library where he performed beside and befriended filmmaker Michelle Parkerson. He also performed at other institutions, including Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of California at Los Angeles to name a few.James, Winston G. \\"Hemphill, Essex (1957-1995)\\". Encyclopedia of African-American Literature. Ed. Wilfred D. Samuels. New York: Fact on File, 2007, pp. 240‚Äì242. In 1982, Essex Hemphill, Larry Duckett, his close friend, and Wayson Jones, his university roommate, founded the spoken word group called \\"Cinque,\\" which performed in the Washington D.C. area. Hemphill continued performing his rhythmic, spoken word poetry, and in 1983, received a grant from Washington Project for the Arts to perform an \\"experimental dramatization\\" of poetry entitled Murder on Glass, alongside Parkerson and Jones. Hemphill also began publishing his own collections of poetry during this time, beginning with Diamonds Was in the Kitty and Some of the People We Love (1982), and followed by the more favorably reviewed Earth Life (1985) and Conditions (1986). He would garner more national attention when his work was included in In the Life (1986), an anthology of poems from black, gay artists, compiled by Hemphill's good friend, lover, and fellow author, Joseph F. Beam. His poetry has been published widely in journals, and his essays have appeared in Obsidian, Black Scholar, CALLALOO, and Essence among others. In 1986, Hemphill received a fellowship in poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts. Essex Hemphill also made appearances in a number of documentaries between 1989 and 1992. In 1989, he appeared in Looking for Langston, a film directed by Isaac Julien about poet Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance.Chi-Yun Shin, Carl. \\"Reclaiming The Corporeal: The Black Male Body And The 'Racial' Mountain In Looking For Langston.\\" Paragraph 26.1/2 (2003): 201.Humanities International Complete. Web. May 5, 2016. Hemphill also worked with Emmy award-winning filmmaker Marlon Riggs on two documentaries:Tongues Untied (1989) which looked into the complex overlapping of black and queer identities, and Black is... Black Ain't (1992) which discussed what exactly constitutes \\"blackness.\\" After Beam's death from AIDS in 1988, Essex Hemphill and Beam's mother worked conjointly in order to publish his sequel to In the Life. The second manuscript was published in 1991 under the title Brother to Brother: New Writings by Black Gay Men, which archived the works of about three dozen authors, including Hemphill himself. Writing about Hemphill and Beam in his book, Evidence of Being: The Black Gay Cultural Renaissance and the Politics of Violence, Darius Bost notes that Hemphill moved in with Beam's mother to help finish the anthology, taking on domestic tasks in exchange for room and board. He writes that Hemphill said in an interview that the anthology ‚Äúwas produced in the ‚Äòcontext of confronting AIDS and the death around us. It‚Äôs almost like a fierce resistance that says, ‚ÄòBefore I die, I‚Äôm going to say these things.‚Äô‚Äô‚Äù Hemphill also wrote a poem dedicated to Beam after his death titled ‚ÄúWhen My Brother Fell,‚Äù and dedicated his 1986 poem ‚ÄúHeavy Corners‚Äù to him. In 1990, he gave a speech at the OutWrite conference (where he was the only Black panelist), which eventually became the introduction to the anthology. Brother to Brother would go on to win a Lambda Literary Award. In 1992, Hemphill published his largest collection of poetry and short stories, entitled Ceremonies: Prose and Poetry, which included recent work, but also selection from his earlier poetry collections, Earth Life and Conditions. The next year, the anthology would be awarded the National Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual New Author Award and a Pew Charitable Trust Fellowship in the Arts. In 1993, he was a visiting scholar at the Getty Center.  Death  In the 1990s, Hemphill would rarely give information about his health, although he would occasionally talk about \\"being a person with AIDS.\\"Duberman (2014), Hold Tight Gently, pp. 113‚Äì114. It was not until 1994 that he wrote about his experiences with the disease in his poem \\"Vital Signs.\\"Duberman (2014) ,Hold Tight Gently, pp. 291‚Äì304. He died on November 4, 1995, of AIDS-related complications.  Legacy  After his death, December 10, 1995 was announced by three organizations (Gay Men of African Descent (GMAD), Other Countries, and Black Nations/Queer Nations?) to be a National Day of Remembrance for Essex Hemphill at New York City's Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center. In his essay \\"(Re)- Recalling Essex Hemphill\\" in Words to Our Now, Thomas Glave, pays tribute to Hemphill's life, focusing on the lasting effects of his actions.Glave, Thomas. \\"(Re)- Recalling Essex Hemphill.\\" Words to Our Now. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005. 23‚Äì30. Glave writes: > In this now, we celebrate your life and language Essex. So celebrating, we > know that we re-call you in what is largely, to borrow from another > visionary, a 'giantless time.' The sheer giantry of your breathing presence > has passed. Now present and future warriors‚Äîourselves and others‚Äîwill be > compelled to learn, as you did and made manifest, that all hauls toward > truth‚Äîtoward venality; ardor, not arrogance; forthrightness, not cowardice. In 2014, Martin Duberman wrote Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill, and the Battlefield of AIDS in which Duberman documents the life of Essex Hemphill, along with author and activist, Michael Callen. The book would go on to win the Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Nonfiction. In June 2019, Hemphill was one of the inaugural fifty American ‚Äúpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes‚Äù inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall‚Äôs unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Works  Themes  Much of Hemphill's poetry and spoken word was autobiographical, and portrayed his experiences as a minority in both the African-American and LGBT communities.\\"Essex Hemphill.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2010. Literature Resource Center. He wrote pieces such as \\"Family Jewels,\\" which conveyed his frustrations about white bigotry, specifically within the gay community.Duberman (2014), Hold Tight Gently, pp. 75‚Äì88. In his essay \\"Does Your Momma Know About me?\\" Hemphill criticizes photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's The Black Book, which showcased pictures of the penises of black men. Hemphill argued that excluding the faces of the black male subjects demonstrated the fetishism of African Americans by whites in the gay community. The poems and essays in Ceremonies address the sexual objectification of black men in white culture, relationships among gay black men and non-gay black men, HIV/AIDS in the black community and the meaning of family. He also goes on to critique both the institutionalized patriarchy, and dominant gender identities within society.Thomas, Greg. \\"Brother To Brother/Ceremonies (Book).\\" Educational Studies 24.3 (1993): 277. Academic Search Complete. Hemphill repeatedly invoked loneliness throughout his work. Loneliness in Hemphill's work is a traumatic feeling, a constant sense of rejection. Many of the men returned home after being rejected by white gay communities, only to be rejected within black communities as well. In Hemphill's poetry, he portrays loneliness as a collective feeling. He defined loneliness as a sense of being, marked by suffering without public recognition. A sense of separation from the public creates a social longing because even though the journey is lonesome, fighting against that journey not to kill you, as Hemphill said in one of his poems, makes you yearn for community and support.

The music was written by Jule Styne with the lyrics by Frank Loesser. Composer Irving Berlin was a huge admirer of the song. Berlin reportedly said that of all the songs by other composers he had heard, he would have been most proud to have written \\"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\\". Writing of Berlin's praise for the song, Loesser wrote in his diary, \\"Irving Berlin came in today and spent a solid hour telling me that 'Walk' is the best song he ever heard. He played and sang it over, bar by bar, explaining why it's the best song he ever heard. I was flattered like crazy.\\" A review in the trade publication Billboard called the composition \\"one of those natural songs with a down-to-earth story that boy sings to girl and vice versa, with a matching melody that makes it contagious on the first listen\\". The song was published in 1941. \\"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\\" was first performed in the 1942 Paramount Pictures film, Sweater Girl, by actress Betty Jane Rhodes. In 2012, Tom Vallance of The Independent wrote of Rhodes' performance, \\"Her place in the history of popular song is secured by her having introduced on screen one of the great songs of wartime longing, \\"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\\".\\" \\"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\\" became a number one pop hit for Harry James and his orchestra in 1942, with Helen Forrest as vocalist (Columbia 36478), and other charting versions that year were by Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore.

The series chronicled the relationship of three sisters, and the support the youngest two especially needed from their eldest married sister. Sibs was created by Heide Perlman and executive produced by Perlman, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, all of whom had been showrunners of Fox's The Tracey Ullman Show. The series was backed by Brooks' Gracie Films company and Columbia Pictures Television. Synopsis Sibs starred veteran actress Marsha Mason as Nora Ruscio, a successful accountant and Alex Rocco as her long- suffering husband, Howie. The source of most of Howie's frustration was his wife's younger sisters (the siblings, or \\"sibs\\", of the title), Audie (Margaret Colin) and Lily (Jami Gertz). Audie was a real estate agent and hence almost unemployed in the era's weak market; she was also recovering from a recent bout of alcoholism. Lily had just been dumped by her boyfriend, who had fled to Germany without her, and had a host of other problems. Both sisters brought all of their problems to Nora, continuing a pattern that had apparently begun when they were all children. In the beginning of the pilot, Nora was distraught after just having learned that the head of her accounting firm had died. Nora's late boss had left the firm to his boorish, whiny nephew Warren Morris (Dan Castellaneta), who was another ongoing character. Shortly after inheriting his uncle's firm, Warren had fired Nora, only to learn that she was the one most of the client base had trusted, and that most of them left with her. He was now unemployed and constantly begging Nora for a job. The original title proposed for the series was Grown-ups. Cast *Marsha Mason as Nora Ruscio *Alex Rocco as Howie Ruscio *Margaret Colin as Audie *Jami Gertz as Lily *Dan Castellaneta as Warren Morris Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } Broadcast Main cast of Sibs. Sibs premiered as a preview telecast on Tuesday, September 17, 1991 at 9:30/8:30c, utilizing a lead-in from Roseanne and airing one hour after the series premiere of Home Improvement. The following night, the show began airing in its regular Wednesday 9:30/8:30c time period, kicking off the latter half of the three-hour Wednesday comedy block that ABC was promoting as The Hump. Ultimately, Sibs had very little appeal to a mass audience, and garnered weak ratings in its first month on the air. The series' low ratings adversely affected the shows that followed it, Anything but Love and Good & Evil, another freshman comedy, which, in its own right, was struggling due to its 10:30/9:30c scheduling and controversy over its storylines. Sibs was put on hiatus in late October 1991 as the three-hour sitcom block was discontinued (Anything but Love moved into Sibs' time slot, while Good & Evil was canceled). The remaining episodes were aired by ABC in April and May of 1992, on Tuesdays at 9:30/8:30c (again following Roseanne), and the series was officially canceled during May 1992 upfronts. After cancellation: Related By Birth In 1993, a year after the series' cancellation, Heide Perlman proposed a new comedy pilot for ABC which was a re-conceived version of Sibs. Perlman was successful in having Margaret Colin, Jami Gertz and Dan Castellaneta participate in the new pilot, in which all reprised their Sibs characters of Audie, Lily and Warren respectively. ABC greenlighted the pilot, titled Related By Birth, and it was produced later that year. This incarnation focused on the close relationship of sisters Audie and Lily, with no mention as to the existence of older sister Nora or brother-in-law Howie (as Marsha Mason and Alex Rocco declined to appear in this project). Audie, who had been cynical and icy in Sibs, exhibited a softer personality in this version, whereas Lily was portrayed as more neurotic. Warren, whose character had also become more subdued, was a companion of the girls, while the new supporting cast included Mark Nassar as Audie's frantic, entrepreneurial boss Michael Brickman and Grayson McCouch as Henry, Lily's assistant in a catering business. ABC aired Related By Birth as a summer pilot special on July 2, 1994, but passed on developing the project into a weekly series.

Directed by comedy veteran Leo McCarey, the film was written by Grover Jones, Frank Butler and Richard Connell based on a play of the same name by Lynn Root and Harry Clork which was presented on Broadway in 1934. An example of the popular screwball comedy genre of the time, and critically Harold Lloyd's most successful talkie, it tells the story of a Brooklyn milkman who becomes middleweight boxing champion. The Milky Way features supporting performances by Adolphe Menjou and Verree Teasdale. Plot Timid milkman Burleigh Sullivan (Lloyd) works for the American company, Sunflower Dairies. Two drunk men try to chat up Mae, Burleigh's sister, and he chances by. In an ensuing brawl, Speed McFarland, the world middleweight champion, gets knocked out (but Burleigh never in fact threw a punch; he merely ducked to get out of the way of a punch which brought the champ down). McFarland's boss, the crooked Gabby Sloan (Adolphe Menjou), decides to promote Sullivan in a series of fixed fights that will culminate in him being knocked out in a real fight with McFarland. Against all the odds, Sullivan triumphs and becomes world champion.

Winthrop Lemoyne Cast notes: * Anthony Quinn has an uncredited bit part as an extra, his first film appearance. * Thomas A. Curran, the early American silent film star, plays an uncredited bit part. Production The Milky Way had originally been optioned as a vehicle for Jack Oakie with Edward Everett Horton and Gertrude Michael in the main supporting roles, but when Oakie was replaced with Harold Lloyd, the role of the manager was to go to William Frawley, because studio executives felt that Lloyd and Horton were too similar in comic style. The part eventually went to Adolphe Menjou.TCM Notes Both Brian Donlevy, who played the role of \\"Speed McFarland\\" on Broadway,IBDB The Milky Way and boxer-turned-actor Max Baer were considered for roles in the film, but were not cast. Actress Ida Lupino was to have played \\"Polly Pringle\\", but dropped out because of illness, to be replaced by Dorothy Wilson. Helen Mack and Verree Teasdale were also replacements, the parts having originally gone to Sally Blane and Gail Patrick. Although they are not in the film, before filming began, the Dionne Quintuplets had been expected to make an appearance. Filming on The Milky Way began on 22 July 1935,TCM Overview but it was interrupted by the illnesses of Menjou, Teasdale and director Leo McCarey, who was hospitalized. McCarey's place was taken by his brother, Ray McCarey and by veteran director Norman Z. McLeod. During filming, when a suitable white horse for Burleigh could not be found, make-up artists bleached a dark-colored horse blonde. Critical reception Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, giving particular praise to Harold Lloyd and Adolphe Menjou for their roles. Summarizing, Greene notes that \\"with the gag-makers at the top of their form and Mr Menjou at the top of his, we have the best 'Harold Lloyd' to date\\". (reprinted in: ) Remake When producer Samuel Goldwyn bought the rights to the property in the mid-1940s for his remake, The Kid from Brooklyn (with Danny Kaye in the lead role), he also bought the original negative and almost all existing prints, and destroyed them. Harold Lloyd, however, had preserved his own original nitrate release print, which became the source for the new digital video transfer used by TCM.Fristoe, Roger \\"The Milky Way\\" (TCM article) Lionel Stander played the role of \\"Spider\\" Schultz in both versions of the film.

In modern times the first known occurrence is of a short story by non-Bah√° º√≠ Tom Ligon The Devil and the Deep Black Void,Found in Analog (New York), v.106 no.1 (Jan. 1986)  he also wrote a sequel The Gardener.Found in Analog (New York), v. 113 no. 11 (Nov. 1993) The next fictional publication, in 1991, which references the Bah√° º√≠ Faith may be a short story \\"Home Is Where‚Ä¶\\" by Bah√° º√≠ Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff, Initially and occasionally since, reference has been made to the events and figures of B√°bism. As the history and events and coverage of these events in Persia made their way to Europe, coverage tended to shift to the events and figures of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. B√°b√≠ focus Early writers Austrian Marie von Najmajer wrote a poem dedicated to Tahireh in Gurret-√∫l-Eyn: Ein Bild aus Persiens Neuzeit published in 1874. Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queiroz, a well known Portuguese novelist in the 19th century, wrote a novel Correspond√™ncia de Fradique Mendes in 1889 and spends several pages discussing the religion of the B√°b and its impact. The material could not all have been derived from the most widespread review of the religion in that day - the work of Arthur de Gobineau. It is speculated Queiroz encountered Bah√° º√≠s in Egypt sometimes from late 1869 to January 1870. The story is set in 1871. A more extensive reference to the events of the B√°b√≠ Faith comes from an obscure writer, A. de Saint-Quentin, in the book Un Amour au Pays des Mages in 1891 in the background of many events of the B√°b√≠ period. Polish/Russian playwright Isabella Grinevskaya wrote the play B√°b based on the life and events of the founder of the B√°b√≠ religion which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7, and lauded by Leo Tolstoy and other reviewers at the time. In 1904 Edith Wharton published a short story with mention of the B√°b√≠ Faith. As early as 1908[Letter 1908, Nov. 23d, St. Joseph, Missouri [to] Editors, Scribners Magazine [manuscript], (An inquiry about the return of the manuscript The Bab.) Constance Faunt Le Roy Runcie attempted to publish a romance novel about the Bab and \\"Persia's celebrated poetess Zerryn Taj\\", a handwritten text by Constance Fauntleroy Runcie, circa < 1908. while living in Missouri, USA. The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, 28 September 1913, printed a story \\"Number Thirteen by the Master of Mysteries\\" on pages 64 and 67 of which discusses a note that seemed to indicate the involvement of a Baha'i woman in a situation.  Sherlock Holmes \\"The Bab Deception\\" by William C Paxton  Published as one of four stories (78 pages out of a total 239), \\"The Bab Deception\\" in The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by non-Bah√° º√≠ William \\"Bill\\" Paxton (not the actor Bill Paxton) was published in 2000-1. A published synopsis: Set in August 1896, Sherlock Holmes expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites Watson to a (spiritualism based) s√©ance. Lestrade & Macintosh take Holmes & Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to Persia, who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the Bay√°n in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on B√°bism. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation enough to know that \\"Abo of-Baha\\" is a political prisoner at that time and knowing full well that the religion would never associate with such a plot had already suffered many martyrs and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the Diogenes Club, where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the Shah of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he is well aware of the reputation of the Bah√° º√≠s and believes in their innocence. Holmes & Watson are invited to a s√©ance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the s√©ance, a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a \\"Baker Street Baha'i\\", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes can learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bah√° º√≠s. Note that on 1 May 1896 Nasser-al-Din Shah was indeed assassinated and some did blame a Bab√≠ but most information points to an anarchist who had been given privileged access to the person of the Shah because of the Shah's sympathies for his suffering. Most Baha ºis have some information of an acknowledged assassination plot by some Babis in 1852 for which Bah√° ºu'll√°h was incarcerated in the Siyah-Chal and eventually found innocent albeit much property had been confiscated or lost to mobs as a result of simply being accused. This is a different incident.  Bahiyyih Nakhjavani's books  The Saddlebag: A Fable for Doubters and Seekers, a published review of the 2000 publication notes: > [A] day in the life of nine 19th-century characters traveling between Mecca > and Medina in this engaging first novel. Though they come from a wide > variety of religious, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds, all find > themselves in the same caravan when it is beset by a sandstorm and a brutal > bandit attack.

The novel's Baha'i message is beautifully rendered > in these tales of multiple paths leading to one destination. Nakhjavani has published six books - some academic and at least two fictional, as well as articles and poetry. Another is La femme qui lisait trop (The Woman Who Reads Too Much) in 2007. It tells the story of T√°hirih. The writer adopts the revolving points of view, of the mother, sister, daughter and wife respectively, to trace the impact of this woman's actions on her contemporaries and read her prophetic insights regarding her times, and perhaps ours too.  Others  Nazanin Afshin-Jam was set to play a role as Tahirih in a film by Jack Lenz named Mona's Dream about the life story of Mona Mahmudnizhad. Sarah Bernhardt, the best-known French actress of her day, asked two of her contemporary authors, Catulle Mend√®s and Henri Antoine Jules-Bois, to write a play about Tahirih and the Babis for her to portray on stage. Bah√° º√≠ focus In 1911 Brit E. S. Drower wrote The Mountain of God around the lives of the Bah√° º√≠s in the Haifa-Akka area and is a thinly veiled set of characters showing the influence of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in the community.The Mountain of God, by E. S. Stevens, published in World Order, 4:3-4:4 pages 28-52; 33-50, 1911/1970. In 1912 American Gertrude Atherton wrote a novel Julia France and Her Times wherein Julia goes to Akka to meet  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, returns to England and convinces her friend to write a book about the Bah√° º√≠s. In 1914 Canadian humorist Stephen Butler Leacock wrote a parody about  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, The Yahi-Bahi Society of Mrs. Resselyer-Brown, like a chapter in his Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich.  Khalil Gibran's books  A published account notes about Khalil Gibran: > It was on 6 April 1943, in her studio-room, upstairs at the front of the > house, that Juliet shared with me and a few other guests, these memories of > Khalil Gibran‚Ä¶ \\"He lived across the street from here,\\" said Juliet Thompson, > \\"at 51 West 10th. He was neither poor nor rich - in between. Worked on an > Arab newspaper; free to paint and write. His health was all right in the > early years. He was sad in the later years, because of cancer.

Very poetic. \\"A Syrian brought him to see me - can't > even remember his name. Khalil always said I was his first friend in New > York.

I liked The Prophet best. I don't believe that > there was any connection between  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and The Prophet. But he told > me that he thought of the  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° all through. He said that he was > going to write another book with ' ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as the center and all the > contemporaries of ' ªAbdu'l-Bah√° speaking. He died before he wrote it. He > told me definitely that [the book] The Son of Man was influenced by > ' ªAbdu'l-Bah√°.\\" It is known that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° also sat for portraits at the request of Gibran. From the above, it may be concluded that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and Gibran knew each other more than in passing, but that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° made no formal or informal claims or suggestions about Gibran's writing but cooperated whenever asked (as for sitting for the drawings.) So the influence is really at the choice of Gibran - he could as well have chosen and mentioned any other source of inspiration for his book. It seems he chose  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. As  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° is one of the central figures of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and these are works of fiction, it is certainly the case that at least two of Gibran's, and his most famous, are properly mentioned here. There are many reviews of this famous book, The Prophet. Here's one: > Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a book that has touched many people very > deeply since its publishing in 1923. It has been translated into more than > twenty languages, and the American edition alone has sold more than four > million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself and by the general > public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is > leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the > past twelve years. He has, for that period, been waiting for a boat to take > him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only > that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book > occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk > stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He > talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is > asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition > because their reward is their joy. He also talks about things like marriage, > work, friendship, and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing > the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is interesting. > It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are > words to live by and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book > that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the > beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking > about life and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book > is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an > audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I > thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the > ages, and still, hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote > them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within these pages are lessons that one > would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more > people read this book, then the world as a whole might become a more easily > survivable place. Here is one of many reviews of Jesus, The Son of Man: > I find it amazing that he wrote this in the period he did. It's very > prophetic, it seems to be in line with a more modern understanding of Jesus > that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large > part of vocalizing.

And whether he was God, man, a combination of both > that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an > envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be > nothing less than relevant to our comprehension. Curiously, this is not the only case where someone associated with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith wrote a speculative work about things the New Testament is silent on in regards to Jesus. Contemporaries of Gibran Juliet Thompson and Wellesley Tudor Pole wrote books about Jesus. Thompson wrote I, Mary Magdalen and Tudor Pole wrote The Silent Road, A Man Seen Afar, and Writing on the Ground as well as some pamphlets though these were written later in the 20th century. Both Thompson and Tudor Pole knew  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° well having interviewed him and worked with him. Thomson wrote a diary, one of the central records of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s journeys to the West as well as a portrait and Tudor Pole played a significant role in saving his life in World War I. Indeed, the whole relationship between  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and Jesus was one  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was at pains to clarify both to the general public and among early Bah√° º√≠s. Tom Ligon's trilogy Among Tom Ligon's many short and medium-sized works (and one award- winning science fact article published in relation to Fusion rocket technology and advocate of Inertial Electrodynamic Fusion), two published in 1986 and 1993, The Devil and the Deep Black Void, and The Gardener in Analog Magazine, are science fiction stories which are about a Shi ªa Muslim terrorist organization in a largely Muslim space-faring civilization where Bah√° º√≠s are space colonists who undertake terraforming on a planet they named Mazra'ih (though there is a brief mention of a United States National Spiritual Assembly back on Earth.) The prequel, For a Little Price Additional reviews at:  about how terrorists are prevented from crashing a spaceship into the Earth (long predating the events of the 11 September 2001 attacks) was anthologized in 2008 though work began on it in 1986. In the succeeding stories, some of the terrorists are instead driven to an unusual world orbiting a neutron star where Bah√° º√≠s live which eventually reveals that civilizations have reached great levels of technology and then mysteriously disappeared. The initial thought is that the civilizations are eradicated by periodic sterilization the planet undergoes but there is also evidence the civilizations vanished peacefully before the sterilization speculating that civilizations shortly after achieving deep space exploration reach some new level of civilization that doesn't require or sustain material civilization in deep space. The ethical conflict of pacifism, a debatable stance associated with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in the face of terrorists is worked out. One character, who takes on the name of the historical B√°b√≠ who performed an assassination attempt on the life of the Shah of Iran, chooses the path of violence in defense of the population by way (as portrayed) of matching a strength of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in acceptance of science compared to a weakness of Shia Islam of superstition. The author comments: > \\"The Devil and the Deep Black Void\\" had an interesting genesis. I remember > being outraged by reports coming from the far east. Vietnamese \\"boat people\\" > were being preyed on by pirates. I set up a situation where a political > upset in a distant colony would make it likely that refugees would be preyed > on by pirates. However, the story developed a mind of its own. I realized > that, due to the vastness of space, the pirates would be easy to evade. The > real threat was the vastness itself.

My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith > by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is > suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by > my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even > armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in > Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up > arms in the defense of the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back > them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which > enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual > dilemma.

Hoping to give Hab, our hero, > some hint of faith back, not to mention some much-needed feminine > companionship, I devised a story to show what he'd been up to in seven years > of self-imposed exile on a remote continent of a planet just begging for > life.\\" Among the special qualities to Mr. Ligon's contribution to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in fiction is that he is a non-Bah√° º√≠, the stories mentioned explicitly reference the religion, and indeed the religion provides some of the central contexts for the storyline, and possibly the first publication to seriously reference the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in fictional literature context. See Persecution of Bah√° º√≠s, Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Turkmenistan and Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Azerbaijan for cases of Bah√° º√≠ responses to violence. The final publication, \\"For a Little Price\\", is part of an anthology, A Mosque Among the Stars, that is free for download. Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff's works Bohnhoff has won several awards for her works of fiction and music (especially filk music which is music tied to science fiction or related styles or issues). Bohnhoff's first work to use the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as a central aspect of a story may be her 1991 published \\"Home Is Where‚Ä¶\\" novelette summarized as \\"A Baha'i family from the year 2112 is on a time travel research assignment in the midwest USA, in 1950.\\" There has not been a published review of her work noting the presence of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in her works generally. Her first publication was in 1989 and her publications continue through 2006. Bohnhoff, mother of two and married since 1981 (both true at least as of 2001), has also written many short stories and novelettes, some of them with a significant basis in relation to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in most of the well known publishing magazines: Analog Magazine, Interzone, Amazing Stories, Realms of Fantasy, and others. Another example \\"The White Dog\\" wherein a lady whose shocking albino appearance is eventually warmly loved by the special relationship pointed out by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° for a little white dog. Her longest work with a strong presence of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is The Meri fantasy series which is a trilogy (The Meri published in 1992, Taminy in 1993, and The Crystal Rose in 1995). The series revolves around the period of transition among the people who live on a peninsula. The chapters are headed with quotes from scripture presented as those of the religion of the people but many are quotes from Bah√° º√≠ scripture, while a few are from the Bible. The first and second book also carries an acknowledgment of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, a Local Spiritual Assembly and Bah√° º√≠ community. The plot involves a progression on the understanding of a person about the role and position of women. Unknown to the people of the story, women have always been instrumental to their religion as agents of God and a chosen few have always acted as the personification of the Spirit of God, or \\"Meri\\". The first book focuses on a young girl destined to take on that role. While similar to other stories of the triumph of women it has several unique qualities most particularly a central male character being her benefactor and teacher and not an obstacle she has to overcome. The second book focuses on the return of the prior \\"Meri\\" who takes it as her mission to promulgate the new paradigm as the head of the religion. The third book focuses on her transition to being ahead of state but wrestling with several of the same issues from among as well as beyond her people. Another novel she has written called The Spirit Gate has many of the same features but is written in a different context - a fantasy work set in a historical time and place of roughly 1000AD in the area today of Poland and Ukraine where two forms of Christianity and Islam met the pagan older religion. Bah√° º√≠ themes, especially in the respect granted other religions, are largely identified with the older religion, however, the names of some of the central figures of the religion appear near the end without strongly hinting at any spiritual prominence (names of an ambassador and Caliph, not simply religious figures.) Among Bohnhoff's unique contributions to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in fiction is that she is a Bah√° º√≠ who has had more than three dozen works published in many major and some minor publishing venues and she has written at least 6 full- length novels of her own - four with strong Bah√° º√≠ references though mentioning something about the religion in the others. In combination, she has probably subtlety or directly presented themes of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to the widest audience in literature. An anthology of many of her stories was published as I Loved Thy Creation which is available for download for free.  Isabel Allende El Plan Infinito (The Infinite Plan)  Best-selling Chilean author Isabel Allende published this novel in 1991. The main character, Greg Reeves, engages in a search for meaning and identity. His mother is a Baha'i. She is portrayed in a somewhat negative light.  Joseph Sheppherd's The Island of the Same Name  Bah√° º√≠ Joseph Sheppherd uses his wide experience living in many countries and professional knowledge as an anthropologist and archaeologist to write an embracing story about the adventures and discoveries of spiritual leaders bound to an island off Africa. The center pivotal periods of the story revolve around two generations of researchers: an archaeologist and his anthropologist daughter. Each, in turn, visits the same African island, but take vastly different discoveries as the story travels in four different periods: humanity's distant past, near past, near future, and far future. Published in 1997 the near past and future are near enough to have their relative positions significantly altered - the 1970s for the first and the 2000s for the second, roughly now. This book is over 500 pages long and covers a wide range of topics in careful detail from the practicalities of stone ax making, through archeological digs in tyrannical third world countries, spiritual values expressed among aboriginal peoples of the world and the practical lives of individual people occasioned by mystical experiences and those around them, and so on. It follows the form of addressing life at different times and thus a kind of science fiction, but like other entries in this article emphasizes the inward issues and spiritual discoveries more than the quasi-magical or technological leaps made as part of the plot. Mr. Shepperd prefers the term \\"social fiction\\" rather than science fiction. The Bah√° º√≠s, or any paraphrases of principles of the religion, are at best obliquely referred to until late in the second section, of the near past, when an Iranian Doctor mentions the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and his reasons for living in a place far from his home and how the principles of the religion stand in the context of the international challenges and needs of humanity. A key character in the book shows interest and later joins the religion but aside from a few specifics there is no clear statement of the future position of the religion nor how the future world culture was established (brief references to a dual process that has merged before the distant future, but doesn't state explicitly what place the Bah√° º√≠ Faith has in this pattern.) However, in the header of each section there is a text presented with a dating scheme that is exactly that of the Bah√° º√≠ calendar so for example 2007 of the common calendar is year 163 of the Bah√° º√≠ Era, or BE. While the textual reference is exact it only becomes clear when the two dating schemes are cross-referenced and the explicit mention of the religion had already been made. Late in the story, the Universal House of Justice is mentioned as having 19 members, and a metropolis called Haifaakka is mentioned. However, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is not framed as the singular or dominant theme of the story - it is but an explicit component of the plot occasionally and a subtext for specifics recognizable but not identified as specifically related to the religion. In other words, the majority of the content of the book describes how the world at large arrives at a Bah√° º√≠ oriented future, but not how the Bah√° º√≠ Faith itself arrives to be in that position. Mr. Sheppherd has published about 10 works before the year 2000 (and lost an additional 15 unpublished works in a house fire in 2002) ranging from professional publications to Bah√° º√≠ centered works whether of formal introduction or children's literature, poetry or this science/speculative fiction analysis of the multi-century changes based on humanity's response to a religion centered in the non-west, specifically an African island. Arvid Nelson's Rex Mundi Rex Mundi is an American comic book published by Dark Horse Comics written by Bah√° º√≠ Arvid Nelson. It was first published in 2002 and has run through 2008. The series is a quest for the Holy Grail told as a murder mystery. It is set in the year 1933, in an alternate history Europe, where magic is real, feudalism persisted, and the Protestant Reformation was crushed by a still politically powerful Roman Catholic Church. All of this is woven together as \\"‚Ä¶ a meditation on the prophecies surrounding the advent of the Bah√° º√≠ era\\". Nelson compares a central character Genevieve with the role of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith - of trying to bring about unity but the story is not used as a means to proselytize the religion.  TK Ralya's The Golden Age: the Thy Kingdom Come  Official synopsis: \\"After one of his friends is killed in Iraq, Geoffrey Waters prays for help in understanding God's purpose for humanity. He is whisked forward in time to witness what a world could be like when the prophecies from Isaiah bring about peace on earth, and the lines 'Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' come to fruition. The people on the planet he visits explain that God's kingdom will be established on Earth no matter what, even if a horrible calamity must occur.\\" The Bah√° º√≠ author notes that this book is her impression of what the future may be like based on the premise of fulfilled Biblical prophecy, with specifics from Bah√° º√≠ sources. There are several quotes and paraphrases from the Bah√° º√≠ writings as well as examples of attitudes among various characters that believe as guided by these references, and the book was approved by the Special Materials Review Committee. Directly it only refers to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as one of many religions mentioned in the foreword (which also mentions that it is meant to be the first of a trilogy.) Internally the strongest reference perhaps is the name of the Book of the religion of the future - \\"Qadas\\", which is similar to \\"Aqdas\\" - the central Book of Laws, of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. However \\"Qadas\\" could also be rather more obscure references (\\"the holiness of God\\", or a Muslim style of prayer for example.) The overall feel of the story is much like Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time - of grand themes being played out not through technological achievements, but of spiritual beings and achievements. Ralya has also published children's stories, two full-length musicals, a weekly newspaper column in a Minnesota paper for about 2 years, and a novel for 9- to 15-year- olds which also has significant reference to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Doing the Impossible official synopsis mentions \\"three fifteen-year-old girls are starting their second year of high school. The 'impossible' thing they are trying to do is living according to God's standards in modern society. Megan gets the lead in the high school play, but her character is a rather 'loose' woman. Her leading man is more interested in 'fun' than appropriateness‚Ä¶ Ashley has a learning disability and wrestles with feeling dumb and unattractive. Brittney is very smart but overweight. She deals with her body image as well as where a smart female fits in society without being considered aggressive. Baha ºi school on Sunday mornings adds the different perspectives of other students.\\" The unique contribution Ralya has made to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in fiction is that her works center on the moral dilemmas of modern society in the west and spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in response to these challenges. On the one hand, she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship between a man and a woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on. On the other hand, she has examined many of the same issues in young ladies' lives in high school.  Karen Anne Webb's \\"Adventurers of the Croatian Union\\" series  Late in 2006, \\"The Chalice of Life\\" was released by Dragon Moon Press, a small Canadian press specializing in science fiction and fantasy. Webb's book, while intended as a fantasy adventure, includes many themes from the Baha'i Writings, including quotes from a variety of faith traditions and a fantasy version of a society based on the fully realized society of the future envisioned by Baha'u'llah. Central to the plot (although the idea is referred to rather than explained with great explicitness in the first book) is the idea of the School of Transcendent Oneness and the idea that a special class of being is sent into Creation from time to time to help civilization along. She relates this to the \\"once and future king\\" concept with the introduction of the quest that forms the overall theme for the series: the search for Eliander, a Carotian prince magicked away long ago to a place outside normal space-time. In the second book, \\"Tapestry of Enchantment,\\" Dragon Moon Press, 2010 this theme of the once and future king comes to the fore when the one character from a world outside the Carotian Union (the system Eliander's return is meant to save) discloses that he believes he is living in the time of his own world's Promised One; his search for this Promised One becomes a strong theme in the series and become the pivot point of the sequel. \\"Lamp of Truth,\\" the third book, is due for publication in early 2011. Dragon Moon has contracted the entire series, the longest work it has ever put under contract and hopes to release the remainder of the books at the rate of about one every six months (slating Eliander for release sometime in late 2013). Remaining books in the series and their settings include \\"The Life of the Smith\\" (ancient Greece); \\"The Floodwaters of Redemption\\" (Mu right before it founders); \\"The Treasure of Mobius\\" (a world projected by a powerful projective telepath; yes, it has one-sided buildings); \\"Dwellers in the Underdark\\" (the Underdark, home of the terrifying Azhur race); and \\"The King That Will Be\\" (variously the planes of incarceration of the quest's nemesis and Eliander as well as a home on Carlos).

The mention of the religion begins about 1 hr 10 min into the film, after the performance of Miriam Makeba. It is not known if the cause of the mention of the religion was scripted or improvised, and if by the choice of Lionel Rogosin, the filmmaker (who may have encountered the religion in Israel or the USA) or the Africans themselves because of their exposure to the religion in the country. In addition to being mentioned directly in a number of works, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and/or its teachings have also been mentioned in the TV and movie industry. For example, the TV series The Simpsons has twice referenced the Bah√° º√≠s - once when Lisa Simpson is considering what religion to join in the episode \\"She of Little Faith\\" she sees \\"Bed, Bath and Bah√° º√≠\\" on a sign (she ends up converting to Buddhism) and also when Bart Simpson is playing Billy Graham's Bible Blaster, a Christian video game (where the player has to convert heathens to Christianity) \\"a gentle Baha'i\\" is one of the images on the screen at Ned Flanders' house in the episode \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\". The movie The Matrix uses parallel terminology to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith but there is little evidence that the movie or its makers were influenced by the religion specifically (more likely Buddhism and Gnostic Christianity). However a movie critic did use the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as the lead off in his review. There was also a TV medical-drama in Australia called MDA - Medical Defense Australia (MDA (TV series)) which went on the air on 23 July 2002 with an ongoing Bah√° º√≠ character, Layla Young, who is played by a non-Bah√° º√≠ actress Petra Yared. The role-playing game Trinity by White Wolf Game Studio, in a futuristic setting, includes a faction called the Interplanetary School for Research and Advancement. Many of its members are humans with psionic powers related to clairsentience. The leader, and as a result many of his followers, is a member of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith.* A second role-playing game, this one based in computer technology, is called The Seven Valleys named after The Seven Valleys and uses it explicitly as inspirations for its adventures. The 14 April 2012 episode of a Prairie Home Companion's News from Lake Wobegone has the character Pastor Liz stopped by a highway patrolman who had grown up Lutheran from a family of Lutherans when he met and married a Bah√° º√≠ (Sasha) and converted. The section occurs about 101:25 through 104:55 minutes. In 2015 the TV show Backstrom, the character Sgt. Peter Niedermayer quotes religious figures in the show - he quotes Bah√° ºu'llah in the premiere episode at about 17:22-17:32 into the show. The 2018 movie Blackpowder and Guilt featured a rural family who was not explicitly stated to be Bah√° º√≠, but who chanted a Bah√° º√≠ prayer at the dinner table. The main character was also seen wearing a nine-pointed star pendant throughout the film, a well-known Bah√° º√≠ symbol.  Further reading  For research and review, the reader may be interested in a few notable instances of research and materials to the presence of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Fiction: # \\"Baha'is in Science Fiction and Fantasy\\", from Adherents.com: \\"This annotated bibliography list, a subset derived from the Adherents.com Religion in Literature database, is intended as a resource for literary research. It lists both mainstream and Baha'i-oriented science fiction/fantasy novels or short stories that contain references to Baha'is. It is not necessarily a comprehensive list of such literature, but all Hugo- and Nebula-winning novels have been surveyed, as have many other major works.\\" # Bah√° º√≠ Library Online - Fiction section, from bahai-library.com. \\"Submissions and book excerpts welcomed.

Note a response was written by Steven Kolins in the discussion section. Mr. Tidhar has published a short work of fiction in the form of a \\"might have been\\" history of the impact the religion could have had. # Bah√° º√≠ Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff has an ongoing presence in several websites, notably www.mysticfig.com and as a continuing contributor at www.authorsden.com. As she says she is \\"hopelessly addicted to words. I get the DTs if I go too long without putting them on paper.\\" and \\"My family and friends have tried to break me of this addiction, but without success. I have published bunches of science fiction stories‚Ä¶\\" # \\"Aslan's Kin\\" has a significant diversity of references to interfaith Fantasy and Science Fiction. # James A. Herrick mentions the religion in his review of science, science fiction, and religion. It refers to a paper, Intelligent Life in the Universe and Exotheology in Christianity and the Baha'i Writings by Duane Troxel, 1996. Herrick's is negatively reviewed by Gabriel Mckee as part of a broader reproachment.

The dispatcher is also responsible for cost effective movement of trains and other on-track railroad equipment to optimize physical (trains) and human resource (crews) assets. History Charles Minot, a Division Superintendent on the Erie Railroad is credited with the first effort to control the movement of a train beyond the rule book and operating timetable, when, in September 1851, he sent a telegram to a railroad employee at another location directing that all trains be held at that point until the train Minot was riding could arrive. From that beginning, a system of train dispatching evolved. The operating rule book, later standardized for all railroads, contained the basic rules for the operation of trains, such as the meaning of the all fixed, audible and hand signals; the form, format and meaning of train orders; and the duties and obligations of each class of employee. The operating, or official, timetable established train numbers and schedules; meeting points for those trains; showed the length of passing tracks at each station as well as indicating the locations where train orders might be issued and contained a variety of other information which might be necessary or useful to train crews operating trains over the territory covered. Train orders supplemented the timetable and the rule book. They were addressed to a particular train or trains and directed that train or trains to do whatever the train dispatcher had decided needed to be done: meet another train, wait at specified locations, run late on its published schedule, be cautious under the circumstances described or numerous other actions. Train dispatchers are required to be intimately familiar with the physical characteristics of the railroad territory for which they are responsible, as well as the operating capabilities of the locomotive power being used. Experienced train dispatchers learned the idiosyncrasies of the locomotive engineers and train conductors and melded that knowledge into the operating decisions made. An efficient train dispatcher could utilize the rule book, timetable, train orders and personal experience to move a large number of trains over the assigned territory with minimal delay to any train, even in single-track territory. Initially, train dispatchers issued train orders using American Morse code over telegraph wires. Later, after the telephone was invented in 1876 and became common, most railroads constructed their own telephone systems, for internal communications, which the train dispatchers used to issue train orders. The last train order known to have been issued using Morse code was copied at Whitehall, Montana, on May 6, 1982, on the Burlington Northern Railroad. Beginning before World War II and accelerating after it, most major railroads installed centralized traffic control (CTC) systems to control train movements. Using CTC, a train dispatcher could align track switches anywhere on the territory so that trains could move into and out of sidings without having to stop and hand throw switches. The train dispatcher could also control the trackside signals governing the movement of trains. Two-way radios enabled train dispatchers to communicate directly with train and engine crews. These capabilities eliminated the need for most train orders, but still required the oversight of a train dispatcher. By country Indonesian train dispatcher In Australia train dispatchers are known as train controllers. Most train controllers are employed by such Australian State and Federal Government organisations as the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia (PTA), Queensland Rail, and Sydney Trains. Others are the employees of privately operated railways such as those found in the Pilbara region. The mining giants BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Fortesque Metals Group, and now also Roy Hill, all operate their own networks from Remote Operation Centres and employ large numbers of train controllers. In Canada a train dispatcher is known as a rail traffic controller (RTC). The two biggest employers of rail traffic controllers are Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific. In New Zealand a dispatcher is known as a train controller, as in Australia. KiwiRail recently centralised all of its train control functions in a single control centre located in the national capital, Wellington, at the southern end of the North Island. Singapore refers to their train dispatchers as train service controllers (TSC). On its Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), they run the Operations Control Centre (OCC) and ensure that trains run on time and manage any incidents on the system.

The Vedette competed in France's large car market at a time when the economy was finally returning to growth, and enjoyed moderate success with its American style finished off by the Italian designer Rapi. It was marketed with different model names according to trim and equipment levels. The Vedette was Simca's largest model at that time and it spawned a more economical version, the Simca Ariane. Simca acquired the Poissy factory from Ford France (Ford Soci√©t√© Anonyme Fran√ßaise, the French subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company), along with the model line, in 1954. The Vedette was therefore initially still marketed as the Ford Vedette. The Vedette was manufactured in Poissy until 1961 and the Ariane until 1963. After that, production continued in Brazil, where the Vedette finally evolved into the Simca Esplanada, following Simca's takeover by Chrysler. Origins and launch In the early 1950s, Henri Th√©odore Pigozzi was looking to expand the manufacturing operations of his Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, where it had been manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there. The cars appeared at the Paris Motor Show in October 1954 on the Ford France stand, but there was no mention of the Ford name on the covers of the brochures offered to potential customers. The name \\"Ford\\" appeared just once, in very small print, on the final page, presumably in order to avoid confusing customers who would be expected to call the cars \\"Simcas\\" from 1 December 1954, the date set for the formal hand-over of the business. In export markets the name change was less immediate, and even in adjacent Belgium, in January 1955 at the Brussels Motor Show the cars were still appearing on the stand of the Belgian Ford importer, sharing the space with models imported from Ford of Britain. First generation The acquisition by Pigozzi took place in July 1954, just when Ford was poised to launch its new, modern Vedette, with a four-door saloon body of \\"American\\" style, much like the contemporary British Fords or Vauxhalls. The car was powered by an unusually small 2351 cc sidevalve V8 engine called Aquilon in France, derived from Ford's Flathead engine family, whose displacement positioned the car into the \\"13 CV\\" French tax class. Equipped with a two- barrel Zenith-Stromberg 32NX carburetor, it produced for the first generation. Power was transferred to the rear live axle through a three-speed manual transmission with column shift. The Vedette had independent front suspension (by MacPherson struts) and drum brakes on all four wheels. As with the Aronde, Simca marketed different trim levels of the Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and, at the top of the range, the Simca Vedette R√©gence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model caught on, Simca was able to increase production from the 150 daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250 cars a day. Pigozzi maintained a schedule of year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder was added to the front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and R√©gence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, R√©gence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the R√©gence and Marly. Production figures *1955 ‚Äì 42,439 *1956 ‚Äì 44,836 *1957 ‚Äì 17,875 Second generation After three years in production, the Vedettes were given new names and a new, elongated body, with a more ornate front end and large tailfins, making the cars even more American-looking than before. This was part of a styling trend shown by most large European cars of that period, which were, to some extent, inspired by American styling, as tailfins appeared on Peugeots, Fiats, BMC models (Pinin Farina-styled), Fords and even Mercedes-Benz cars of that era. The engine was uprated to (now called Aquillon 84) but the fiscal qualification of the car remained unchanged. Using the new body, the Versailles was replaced by Simca Vedette Beaulieu and the R√©gence by the Chambord, while the estate retained the Vedette Marly name. The three-year-old body of the previous Vedette nevertheless continued in production but it lost its V8 2.4-litre engine. In April 1957, fitted with the 1.3 L Aronde engine, the old body now clothed a new model in the Simca range, the Simca Ariane. Later, in October 1957, a V8 version of the old bodied car, with the Aquillon 84 engine, and badged as the Ariane 8, joined the range, replacing the Trianon. 1959 brought a new option, the Rush-Matic automatic transmission, which featured two modes: Rush (fully automatic) and Road (manual gear selection). The same year, assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil. Also during 1959, a new top-of-the-line model joined the Vedette range, the Pr√©sidence, featuring a luxurious interior, a radiotelephone (a European first) and a continental kit. French coachbuilder Chapron built two 2-door Pr√©sidence convertibles for a governor of one of the French colonies. Chapron had another order the next year, to build two four-door convertibles for the French President Charles de Gaulle. The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960, but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year, when they received new seats, new chrome decor, and the engine was fitted with a new anti-vibration crankshaft. French production of the V8-engined cars ended in the summer of 1961, by when 173,288 had been produced, although a Simca Chambord was exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October of that year, suggesting that Simca still had some stock of the cars to clear. The small- engined 4-cylinder Ariane, of which 166,363 were produced, survived until 1963. The model was continued for longer in Brazil, where it was marketed with the 2.4-litre V8 under a variety of names like \\"Tuf√£o\\", \\"Jangada\\", and \\"EmiSul\\". It was eventually replaced by a version with new sheetmetal, called the Simca Esplanada.

Biography Leonard was born on the Aegean island of Chios, then under Genoese domination (cf. Maona of Chios), in . According to his own account, he was of humble parents. He entered the Dominican Order in Chios, and after profession was sent to the University of Padua for his philosophical and theological studies. After ordination he taught at both Padua and Genoa, then at the request of Maria Giustiniani returned to his native island, and was made Archbishop of Mytilene on the island of Lesbos by Pope Eugene IV. There he enjoyed a close relationship with the Gattilusii, the Genoese rulers of Lesbos. In 1452, Cardinal Isidore of Kiev stopped at Lesbos on his way to Constantinople to conduct negotiations for a union between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. Stopping on Lesbos, Isidore invited Leonard to join him. The latter accepted, and arrived at Constantinople with the papal delegation on 26 October 1452. As a result, he was an eyewitness of the subsequent siege and capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in May 1453. It is not known what role he played in the defence; he evidently accompanied Cardinal Isidore, and thus participated both in the councils of the defenders, and in the defence of the sector of Saint Demetrios, that Isidore commanded. During the sack of the city on 29 May, both Isidore and Leonard were captured, but soon were released or ransomed. Leonard was even able to buy some books from the looting Turks on the same day of the sack. Leonard soon managed to find passage to Chios, from where on 16 August he wrote to Pope Nicholas V a detailed account of the fall of Constantinople in a letter. Written in Latin, Leonard's letter \\"describes the conquest in a fashion hostile to the Byzantines and Venetians but favorable to the Genoese\\". It \\"remains our basic source for the event\\" to this day, and was reprinted several times in subsequent centuries, translated into Venetian and vernacular Greek, and was used as a source, or outright copied, by several other authors. His later life is not well documented. Thus it was long believed that he returned to his see at Mytilene, and remained there until the Ottoman conquest of Lesbos in 1462, when he was captured anew. A Latin work describing the siege and capture of Mytilene, De Lesbo a Turcis capta, was long attributed to him, but stylistical differences suggest a different author. Modern scholarship considers that Leonard returned to Italy to campaign for a Christian alliance against the Ottomans, and that he died there in . His successor to the see of Mytilene, Benedetto, was nominated in December 1459, and is the likely author of De Lesbo a Turcis capta. Works His best-known writings is the letter mentioned above and an apologetical tract in answer to the humanist Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini. Both tracts with biographical sketches were edited by Michael Justinian (Avila, 1657). There is reason to believe that many of his letters remain unedited in the Vatican Library.

The series was co-produced by Nikndaph Productions in association with Columbia Pictures Television for CBS. Synopsis Teech stars Phill Lewis as \\"Teech\\" Gibson, an African American music instructor (and the \\"coolest teacher\\") at Winthrop Academy, a prestigious, predominantly-white prep school. Teech loved music and his students and had tremendous appeal even to troubled, disruptive students. Teech also had appeal to Cassie Lee (Maggie Han), the sexy assistant headmaster who had hired him. Headmaster Alfred Litton (Steven Gilborn) wanted to dismiss Teech's troubled students from the school. He apparently would like to have done the same to Teech except he realized that so doing would likely open him to charges of racism and discrimination. Scheduled opposite NBC's Top 20 hit Unsolved Mysteries, Teech drew low ratings and was pulled from the lineup after only four episodes had aired.

The congregation disbanded in 1919. History The congregation was founded in 1851 at the former Norbertine Abbey of Benoite-Vaux in the Department of Meuse. The constitutions and spirit of the congregation were those of the Congregation of Canons Regular of Our Savior, which had been established in 1623 as a reform of the various canonical monasteries in the Duchy of Lorraine by St. Peter Fourier, C.R.S.A., of the Abbey of Chaumousey, and confirmed by Pope Urban VIII in 1628. The scope of the reformed Order, as outlined in the Summarium Constitutionum of Fourier, was the Christian education of youth and the pastoral care of the poor and neglected. The congregation flourished exceedingly throughout the Duchy of Lorraine and made its way into France and the Duchy of Savoy, but was completely destroyed by the French Revolution. Murphy, John F.X. \\"Clerks Regular of Our Saviour.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 20 July 2019 In 1851, four zealous priests of the Diocese of Verdun, anxious to see revived the apostolic labours of the followers of Fourier, withdrew to the secluded site of the former abbey whose church had become the Shrine of Our Lady of Benoite-Vaux. There they began to follow religious life according to the Rule of Life given to his canons by Fourier. Three years later they received the approval of the Holy See, which changed their structure from that of Canons Regular, the form of the earlier congregation, to that of Clerics Regular. Its special work being the education of youth, during the next half of the 19th century the congregation spread and numbered several houses, including one in Verdun which later became a Carmel. The members of the congregation were of three grades; priests, scholastics (seminarians), and lay brothers. Though possessing the title \\"clerics regular\\", they were not such in the strict sense of the word as their religious vows, though perpetual, were simple, according to the practice of the Roman authorities of establishing no new institutes of solemn vows.

This is the fourth book to feature the author's primary protagonist Dirk Pitt. Plot introduction In 1954 \\"Vixen 03\\", an aircraft carrying a top-secret cargo to the military's testing grounds in the South Pacific, crashes and is never recovered. Thirty- four years later while on vacation Dirk Pitt, Special Projects Director for the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), finds the remains of \\"Vixen 03\\" and her top-secret cargo. His salvage efforts turn up some anomalies, including a body that is not of any member of the original crew; and send Pitt on a chase to stop a plot that could potentially leave millions dead. Plot summary In January 1954 a Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter of the United States Air Force, callsign \\"Vixen 03\\", takes off from the Buckley Naval Air Station in Colorado on a late-night flight transporting a top-secret cargo from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal to testing grounds near the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The aircraft never arrives at its destination in the Pacific, and, despite a massive four-month search by the Navy and Coast Guard, no trace of \\"Vixen 03\\" is discovered. The story then jumps forward 34 years; Dirk Pitt, Special Projects Director for the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), is vacationing with Colorado Congresswoman Loren Smith at her late father's cabin in the Sawatch Mountains. Pitt discovers some aircraft parts in the cabin garage and follows this lead until he intuits that there is an aircraft crash site in the local lake, Table Lake. Calling for his friend and Assistant Special Projects Director Al Giordino to fly in specialized NUMA equipment, they survey the lake and quickly find the wreck of \\"Vixen 03\\". Discovering clues found on the wreck, Pitt follows the evidence to retired Admiral Walter Bass, United States Navy, who was the commander who ordered \\"Vixen 03\\" on its top-secret mission. Bass first denies any knowledge of the aircraft, but after Pitt convinces him that he really has found the wreck, the admiral reveals that it was carrying a cargo of 16-inch battleship shells loaded with a deadly biological doomsday organism. The organism, nicknamed QD for quick death, is a virulent bacterial weapon that causes nearly instant death. The agent is described as being so deadly that just five ounces (143 ml) air-dropped over Manhattan Island would kill 98% of all human life and, because the strain actually grows stronger over time, would render the island uninhabitable for up to 300 years. Bass is determined that this doomsday organism, which he hoped was lost forever, must never be used, and convinces Pitt, Admiral Sandecker and the rest of the NUMA team that they must secretly raise \\"Vixen 03\\" and destroy the deadly cargo. The team raises the wreck and discovers that eight of the 36 shells are missing, apparently salvaged by local divers and sold to the Phalanx Arms Company. Pitt follows the trail and is able to recover six of the eight shells, but discovers that the last two were mistakenly sold as part of a large shipment to the African Army of Revolution. The African Army of Revolution (AAR) is an organization of black African militants led by expatriate American Hiram Lusana, with the stated goal of overthrowing the minority white government of the Republic of South Africa by using international public opinion and force against military targets. Pieter de Vaal, Minister of Defense in the South African government, develops a plan to both rid himself of the AAR and topple the existing government and put himself in power. The plan, code-named Operation 'Wild Rose', is a false flag plot to use black mercenaries in a terrorist attack on the United States to discredit the AAR and win sympathy for the white minority government in South Africa. De Vaal recruits Captain Patrick McKenzie Fawkes, late of the Royal Navy--and who believes his family was slaughtered by the AAR --to lead the attack. The plan calls for Fawkes to take control of the former U.S. battleship Iowa--which has been sold for scrap and purchased by an AAR holding company--and strip her down to raise her draft and allow her to ride much higher in the water. Raising the draft will enable Fawkes to sail the ship up the Potomac River and shell Washington D.C. with her 16-inch guns. Unbeknownst to anyone but Pitt and a few others, this will also unleash the deadly QD organism on the nation's capital. With the help of Dale Jarvis, Director of the National Security Agency, Pitt discovers the plot. While the President and the Joint Chiefs launch a plan to take the ship and capture the shells intact, Pitt hopes to keep his promise to Admiral Bass and launches a daring mission of his own to destroy the QD warheads before they can be used - by the terrorists or the government. When he does so, Pitt finds out - thanks to Captain Patrick McKenzie Fawkes, along with a few others - that Pieter de Vaal was behind the slaughter of his family. So, the U.S and the existing government arrange to have him become a 'cold case': a missing person. De Vaal is killed and buried in an unmarked grave - in the middle of nowhere - in Southern Africa.

During this sequence President Dwight David Eisenhower and U.S. Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson appear briefly in fictional roles. References to the development of the Hydrogen Bomb and the military testing conducted on the Bikini Atoll appear during the story as a disguise for the testing of the QD device.

In the United States, the term rib eye steak is used for a rib steak with the bone removed; however, in some areas, and outside the U.S., the terms are often used interchangeably. The \\"rib eye\\" or \\"ribeye\\" was originally, the central portion of the rib steak, without the bone, resembling an eye. It is considered a more flavorful cut than other steaks, such as the fillet, due to the muscle being exercised by the animal during its life. It's the marbling of fat that makes this suitable for slow roasting or grilling cooked to different degrees of doneness. Marbling also increases tenderness, which plays a key role in consumers' rib steak purchase choices. * The short ribs: several ribs cut from the rib and plate primals and a small corner of the square-cut chuck.  Terminology  * In the United States cuisine, a bone-attached beef rib can be called \\"rib steak\\", \\"beef rib\\", \\"bone-in beef rib\\", \\"tomahawk steak\\", \\"bone-in rib steak\\", \\"ribeye steak\\" or \\"cowboy cut\\". * In Australia and New Zealand, a bone-in rib steak is called a \\"ribeye\\". When the bone is removed, Australians and New Zealanders call the resulting piece of meat a \\"Scotch fillet\\" or \\"whiskey fillet\\". * In French cuisine, the rib steak (with bone attached, called c√¥te de b≈ìuf, literally: \\"beef rib\\") is a very popular dish and it is not uncommon to find French restaurants where a massive single c√¥te de b≈ìuf is served for two or more dinner guests. The French entrec√¥te corresponds to the rib eye steak, that is, a rib steak separated from its bone. * In Argentine cuisine, roast short ribs are called indistinctly asado de tira or tira de asado. The rib steak is known as ancho de bife for the entire cut, served with or without the bone, and ojo de bife for the rib eye. * In Spanish cuisine, in Spain, a bone-attached rib steak is called chulet√≥n, while the same cut of meat, when its bone is removed, is called, in Spain, entrecote, a word originated in the French entrec√¥te. *In British cuisine, the terms cote de boeuf, and tomahawk steak, have been widely adopted to refer to the bone-attached rib steak. *In the Middle East, Beef Ribs are often found in Rib Restaurants instead of the non Halal Pork Ribs.

The first masonry castle was constructed by Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, in 1412-1413 on an island, now a peninsula, in Lake Asveja in order to secure the capital Vilnius from attacks from Livonia. No accounts concerning the architecture of Vytautas' castle have survived. It was acquired by Jerzy Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç prior to 1508. He constructed a new palace in the Renaissance style in the first half of the 16th century. After the death of Jerzy, his son Mikolaj \\"the Red\\" inherited the property, causing the town nearby to become an important hub for the Reformation in Lithuania. Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç spent five months in the castle after her marriage to Sigismund Augustus in 1547. The palace used to be one of the most luxurious residences in the Duchy, lagging not much behind the Royal Palace. Dubingiai Castle was the main seat of the Bir≈æai-Dubingiai line of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family until the second half of the 17th century, when it was transferred to Bir≈æai Castle. During the Polish‚ÄìSwedish wars, the castle was pillaged by armies loyal to the King of Poland and was confiscated from Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. It returned to the family in the second half of the 17th century. The neglected castle and church gradually fell into ruins. It was sold to Micha≈Ç Tyszkiewicz in 1808. Today only the foundations and several cellars of the castle and church remain and are being researched. The masonry Calvinist Church of the Holy Spirit was built in the Renaissance style near the castle by Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç prior to 1620 and was intended to be the mausoleum of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. The most prominent members of the family were interred there, including Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1565) and his wife El≈ºbieta Szyd≈Çowiecka (1562), Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1584) and Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1620).

The standard forms are divided into three types, sekar ageng, sekar madya, and sekar macapat, also common with the ngoko terms: tembang gedh√©, tembang tengahan, and tembang macapat. All three types follow strict rules of poetic construction. These forms are highly influential in Javanese gamelan. Sekar ageng The most sacred are the sekar ageng (Low Javanese: tembang gedh√©; \\"great songs\\"). These were traditionally held to be the most ancient of the forms, but Jaap Kunst believed that the indigenous forms represented an older tradition. The ancient forms of these, known as kakawin, use meters from Indian poetry, specifying the number of syllables in each line, their vowel length, and the location of caesurae. Exactly how this ancient form sounded when sung is hard to know, as the modern form has been influenced by gamelan structures. It may have resembled modern Indian or Balinese chant. The modern form of sekar ageng are always in stanzas of four lines, and the number of syllables in each (lampah) is fixed and divided into parts (pedhotan) by caesurae. (Vowel length is no longer distinguished.) These indications are ordinarily indicated with the form; for example, sekar ageng Bongsa patra, lampah 17, pedhotan 4,6,7. According to Padmasasustra, there are 44 types of sekar ageng used in Surakarta.Padmasoesastra, Tatatjara; publication no. 2 of Volkslectuur, 1891, page 249 et seq. Cited in Kunst, 123. A sekar ageng is sometimes used as a type of buka (song introduction) known as a bawa. It is sung solo, or may be supported by the gend√©r. Only the first line is used in the introduction, and the rest may follow in the actual gendhing. Martopangrawit believes that this began only in the late 19th century, at the time of Paku Buwana IX (r. 1861-93).Sumarsam, page 97. Sekar madya and tembang macapat Sekar madya (Low Javanese: Tembang tengahan; \\"middle songs\\") are supposed to lie between the other two genres, but there is no agreement about which genres are considered sekar madya and which are tembang macapat (old orthography: machapat). Both of these, in contrast to sekar ageng, use varying number of lines of varying length, but always in a specific form. Furthermore, the vowel sound of the final syllable must match a specific pattern (note that this is different from syllable rime, as consonants that follow, if any, do not have to match). The pattern of the length of lines is known as guru wilangan, guru p√®tungan, or guru wichalan, while the pattern of vowels is known as dhongdhing or guru lagu. In the schemes below, the number represents the guru wilangan, while the letter is the guru lagu of the corresponding line. In addition to these formal structures, each of these forms has a specific mood. The typical use is indicated after the form for many of the structures below. Padmasoesastra listed 11 types of sekar madya forms used in Surakarta.Padmasoesastra, Tatatjara; publication no. 2 of Volkslectuur, 1891, page 251. Cited in Kunst, 123. Many of them, however, are no longer used. The ones in modern use are: * Juru demung: 8A, 8U, 8U, 8A, 8U, 8A, 8U * Wirangrong: 8I, 8O, 10U, 6I, 7A, 8A * Balabak: 12A, 3√â, 12A, 3√Å, 12A, 3√Å Two meters were classified as macapat forms in the past, but are now considered sekar madya: * Megatruh (or Duduk wuluh): 12U, 8I, 8U, 8I, 8O * Gambuh: 7U, 10U, 12I, 8U, 8O (there are a number of variants of this form) The common macapat forms are: * Dhandhang gula: 10I, 10A, 8√â(O), 7U, 9I, 7A, 6U, 8A, 12I, 7A; neutral character, used especially for introducing another poem * Sinom: 8A, 8I, 8A, 8I, 7I, 8U, 7A, 8I, 12A; didactic poems * Asmarandana: 8I, 8A, 8O(√â), 8A, 7A, 8U, 8A; love poems * Kinanthi: 8U, 8I, 8A, 8I, 8A, 8I; love poems * Pangkur: 8A, 11I, 8U, 7A, 12U, 8A, 8I; violent passions or fighting * Durma: 12A, 7I, 6A, 7A, 8I, 5A, 7I; violent passions or fighting * Mijil: 10I, 6O, 10√â, 10I, 6I, 6U; love poems * Mas kumambang: 12I, 6A, 8I, 8A; longing or homesickness * Pucung: 12U, 6A, 8I, 12A; neutral character, used for riddles As an example, consider the following Kinanthi verse, a stanza from the Serat Centhini: :Ki Jay√®ngraga agupuh :anggamel rebab respati :rebab√© langkung prayoga :watangan pinonthang gadhing :kosok pinatra pinrada :batok jamangan balengginSerat Centhini, Canto 276, stanza 5; cited in Kunst, 224. These forms are the basis of kidung poetry. The text for these songs is frequently used in works for the gamelan, frequently sung by the gerong. Indeed, many modern gendhing share common macapat texts, especially Kinanthi, fit into their individual melodic pattern. Sumarsam believes that the singing of these forms led to the development of the early gendhing gerong, in the mid-19th century.Sumarsam, page 98-99. Wayang performances make use of the Mahabharata and Ramayana in macapat form, created in the 18th and 19th centuries.Sumarsam, page 96. Notes References * Kunst, Jaap.

History The name derives from the Old English hlenc, meaning hill. Nearby Athelney is famous for being the refuge of King Alfred the Great from the Danes before the Battle of Ethandun in 878, and the site of a monastery he founded after his victory. East Lyng is on higher ground towards the west of Athelney. Archaeological research suggests East Lyng was a medieval settlement, and was an important fortified burh during Saxon times, hence the usage of the East Lyng burh and Athelney by King Alfred the Great and his army. The Balt Moor Wall dates to this period. By the time of the Domesday census completed in 1086, Lyng was described as a small rural settlement. In 1267 a charter for a market was granted, but is no longer recorded by 1349. Despite this the settlement at East Lyng retained burh status and was recorded as such in 1498‚Äì99. Lyng was part of the hundred of Andersfield. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny; it also evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. Its role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography The villages occupy an east‚Äìwest ridge within the Somerset Levels, with Hitchings Moor and Salt Moor to the north, and Curry Moor adjoining the River Tone to the south. The ridge falls to the east, ending at Athelney Hill near the confluence of the River Tone and River Parrett at Burrowbridge. North Moor is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its nationally important grazing marsh and ditch system on the Somerset Levels and Moors. A range of neutral grassland types supporting common and scarce plants has developed mainly due to variations in soils and management practices. Aquatic plant communities are exceptionally diverse with good populations of nationally scarce species. The site has special interest in its bird life.English Nature citation sheet for the site (accessed 9 August 2006) Transport The ridge across the Somerset Levels has always been important for transport links. Today it carries the A361 road from Taunton to Street, and the Great Western Railway London Paddington to Penzance main line. The railway originally cut through the ridge just west of East Lyng, and traversed Hitchings Moor, but after years of being blocked by winter floods, the railway was diverted south of the ridge to join the line from Bristol at Cogload Junction. Religious sites The current church at East Lyng, which is dedicated to St Bartholomew, is thought to have been built by the monks who were displaced from Athelney Abbey when it was dissolved by King Henry VIII of England in 1539. The ornate three-stage tower is of lias with hamstone dressings supported by set-back buttresses connected diagonally across the angles of the tower on the bottom two stages; these terminate as diagonal pinnacles on shafts at the third stage. The paired two-light bell-chamber windows have Somerset tracery flanked by attached shafts and pinnacles, with quatrefoil grilles. There are similar single windows on the stage below. The East Lyng churchyard contains the grave of George Marston who was the artist for Ernest Shackleton's 1914 Endurance Trans-Antarctic Expedition.

After the 1915 Armenian Genocide, most of the Armenian population of Arapgir was either killed or deported. Starting in 1922, surviving Armenians of Arapgir found refuge in Soviet Armenia. Consequently, the Arabkir District was officially founded as a settlement north of the Yerevan city centre on November 29, 1925. HSBC Bank Armenia, Komitas branch in Arabkir Their original cemetery was located at the north end of the district near the street of the Molokan community. However, the cemetery was converted into a park around 1963 and the gravestones were removed.

One of the most influential Bulgarian educational centres in Macedonia, it was founded in autumn 1880Bozhinov, p. 73 in Ottoman Thessaloniki (today in Greece) and existed until 1913.Mazover p. 279. Foundation The first Bulgarian school in Thessaloniki was founded in 1871 next to the church of Agios Athanasios. Following the April Uprising of 1876, the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), the Kresna‚ÄìRazlog uprising and other events, the Bulgarian educational cause in Macedonia had to live through a number of blows. Exploiting anti-Bulgarian sentiment among government officials, Greek bishops succeeded in shutting down a lot of Bulgarian schools and in re-introducing the Greek language to Bulgarian churches in the region. As a result, part of the Bulgarian intelligentsia emigrated to the Principality of Bulgaria and the province of Eastern Rumelia. They did, however, manage to continue their work, supported by local municipalities, the Bulgarian Exarchate, and the newly created Bulgarian state. The situation in Thessaloniki remained relatively calm, given the hard situation elsewhere. The presence of foreign consuls and representations was putting some limitations on the Turkish regime. This fact is asserted by some scholars as the main reason behind the opening of a Bulgarian secondary school in Macedonia resembling the ones in Sofia and Plovdiv.Vanchev, p.66 In 1880 the Ottoman Empire adopted an Act on Vilaets which limited Greek bishops‚Äô control over Bulgarian churches. Taking advantage of these developments, revivalist Kuzman Shapkarev prepared a whole plan for Bulgarian education in Macedonia, centred on the region‚Äôs capital ‚Äì Thessaloniki. The city ought to host one men‚Äôs and one girls‚Äô gymnasium with boarding schools attached to each. Prior to their opening, there was a total of 667 Bulgarian basic schools in Macedonia with 949 teachers and 36,623 students.Shatev, p.342 The main obstacle before Shapkarev‚Äôs plan was the Exarchate‚Äôs objection to Thessaloniki hosting the gymnasiums. Dragan Tsankov, who favored the idea in principle, proposed another town situated in Central Macedonia and inhabited by a purely Bulgarian population to host the schools. Despite these differences, the Exarchate backed up the initiative and the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki officially opened doors in the autumn of 1880 with the support of the local Bulgarian community and the Exarchate. Further development The high school began holding classes in 1880 in a building in the same neighborhood. In 1910, the school had eight classrooms, twelve teachers, and 133 students.Demetriades, p. 401 Following the Balkan wars, in 1913 the high school was moved to the town Gorna Dzhumaya in Pirin Macedonia, then ceded to Bulgaria,http://www.farsarotul.org/nl33_2.htm where it exists today as \\"Sts. Cyril and Methodius National Humanitarian High School\\". Among the initiators, principals and teachers at the high school were noted Bulgarian intellectuals, scientists, and public figures such as Kuzman Shapkarev, Vasil Kanchov, Grigor Parlichev, and Konstantin Velichkov. The school's graduates include Gotse Delchev, Dame Gruev, Todor Aleksandrov, Andrey Lyapchev, Ivan Mihaylov, Petar Darvingov, Anton Ketskarov and other key figures of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and politics of the early 20th century.

The historic venue operated as an entertainment venue from 1879 until 2018 and to up to its closure managed to retain all of its art deco features. The site was first occupied by the Theatre Royal, built in 1872 and destroyed by fire only six years later. Renovations were initiated by Jethro Thomas Robinson after the fire, and completed by Frank Matcham, to what became the Elephant and Castle Theatre in 1879, where a very young Charlie Chaplin performed. The Theater was converted to an ABC cinema in 1928, a 3,100 seat cinema designed by Frank Matcham with a revolving steam driven organ. During the World War II, when London was being destroyed by The Blitz, the building stood strong and was often used as a shelter. In the 1950s, the cinema made headlines when the manager exhibited the Bill Haley & His Comets movie Rock Around the Clock and the youthful audience ran riot. In 1966, with the onset of twinning, the Elephant and Castle Cinema was acquired by ABC Cinemas and split into a complex of three cinemas and also a luxury lounge was introduced. The first film to be exhibited was Bonnie and Clyde in 1966. After several more name changes, it became the Coronet Cinema in 1981. The Coronet Cinema closed down in 1999, leaving the Elephant and Castle area with no cinemas. In 2002, a theatre producer and entrepreneur, Dominic Madden bought The Coronet Theatre as a derelict building and subsequently brought the venue back to its celebrated and original Art-Deco, removing the cinema complex, reintroducing the upper-gallery design and removing the rake floor. Following a reputed ¬£3m refurbishment, The Coronet Theatre was launched in April 2003 as a multi-media nightclub but in June 2003 the incumbent nightclub management company, Heaven (nightclub) were replaced by a team led by Simon Parkes, the founder of Brixton Academy as Managing Director. The venue has hosted many popular live music artists including Justin Timberlake, Wolfmother, Blur, Oasis, Primal Scream, The Libertines, Macy Gray, LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Grinderman, The Decemberists, Hundred Reasons, Kelis, Alicia Keys, Caribou, Tame Impala, Placebo, Ty Segall, and The Fall among many more live gigs and parties. The venue continued to operate nightclub and live music events up to its closure. The theatre last operated to 1 January 2018; the building was set for demolition as early as 2019.

The income elasticity for cars ranges from very elastic in poor countries, to inelastic in rich nations. The advantages of car usage include on-demand and door-to-door travel, and are not easily substituted by cheaper alternative modes of transport, with the present level and type of auto specific infrastructure in the countries with high auto usage. Public costs related to the car are several including congestion and effects related to emissions. Private benefits The benefits of using a car differ by many factors, in regard to location and culture. One general benefit is availability of use which, when coupled with public support via infrastructure (such as roads or fuel stations), can allow highly flexible movement and transportation. Because public transportations are not as well omnipresent and normally don't run at certain day periods, they might not be an option. Car allows a certain freedom of movement, that other means of transport do not. Another private benefit car owners enjoy, is comfort. The car allows the transportation of the driver (and passengers) from a certain point A, to another point B, within an acclimatized and protected interior.  Private costs  According to the RAC motorists in the UK spend an average of GBP 5,000 (US$ 9,000) per year on their car, or roughly 1/3 of the average net wage; while the RACV suggestsHow much does it cost to own a car? roughly AUD $10,000 per year, compared to AUD $26,000 median income among all Australian adults or AUD $66,000 median income among all Australian households.The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey This situation is reflected in most other Western nations. For the average car owner, depreciation constitutes about half the cost of running a car. The typical motorist underestimates this fixed cost by big margin, or even ignores it altogether, according to a survey by the RAC. There are a number of reasons for the high cost of car transport: * The typical private car spends most of its lifetime idle and for some vehicles, depreciation is a significant proportion of the total cost. * Compared to bulk-carrying vehicles such as airplanes, buses, and trains, individual vehicles have worse economies of scale. * Capacity utilisation is low. The average occupancy of cars is below 1.5 passengers in most parts of the world. Measures such as High-occupancy vehicle lanes try to address this issue. * The car energy efficiency is one of the lowest amongst several means of transportation. * Government taxes The costs of running a car can be broken down as follows (in no particular order): * Fuel (including fuel tax) * Repairs * Maintenance * Financing * Insurance * Parking * Tolls on Roads, Bridges and Tunnels * Vehicle tax * Vehicle inspection * Registration * Car washes In the UK car travel has steadily become cheaper over the past five decades. According to the Department for Transport, the real cost of running a car has dropped by 9% between 1980 and 2007. This development is in part due to more cost effective manufacturing technologies, and in part due to engines becoming more fuel-efficient. Of the annual running costs of a car for an average person, 70‚Äì75%Based on the breakdown of costs given in the above mentioned RACV study are fixed costs (with respect to distance travelled): a 10% increase or decrease in usage should result in a 2.5‚Äì3% increase or decrease in annual running costs. Some of the annual running costs of a car, which are important in the economics of ownership, concern the service life; a major factor for this deals with the uncertainty of the car lifespan. Many cars, particularly taxis, have achieved very high-mileage (miles driven) status, indicating that maintenance which can extend the car service life may reduce the overall running cost. Public benefits In countries deprived from wide door-to-door public transport and with low density, such as Australia, the automobile plays an important role on the mobility of citizens. Public transport, by comparison, becomes increasingly uneconomic with lower population densities. Hence cars tend to dominate in rural and suburban environments with public economic gains. The automobile industry, mainly in the beginning of the 20th century when the high motorization rates were not an issue, had also an important public role, which was the creation of jobs. In 1907, 45,000 cars were produced in The United States, but 28 years later in 1935 3,971,000 were produced, nearly 100 times as many. This increase in production required a large, new work force. In 1913 13,623 people worked at Ford Motor Company, but by 1915 18,028 people worked there. Bradford DeLong, author of The Roaring Twenties, tells us that, \\"Many more lined up outside the Ford factory for chances to work at what appeared to them to be (and, for those who did not mind the pace of the assembly line much, was) an incredible boondoggle of a job.\\" There was a surge in the need for workers at big, new high-technology companies such as Ford. Employment largely increased. Public costs Corridor Capacity and Infrastructure Costs Health Impacts of Automobility Road Space Requirements The external costs of automobiles, as similarly other economic externalities, are the measurable costs for other parties except the car proprietor, such costs not being taken into account when the proprietor opts to drive their car. According to the Harvard University, the main externalities of driving are local and global pollution, oil dependence, traffic congestion and traffic accidents; while according to a meta-study conducted by the Delft University these externalities are congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs, air pollution costs, noise costs, climate change costs, costs for nature and landscape, costs for water pollution, costs for soil pollution and costs of energy dependency. The existence of the car allows on-demand travel, given, that the necessary infrastructure is in place. This infrastructure represents a monetary cost, but also cost in terms of common assets that are difficult to represent monetarily, such as land use and air pollution. The car allowed a shift in residential locations, as civil engineering grew to handle the infrastructure requirements, allowing the growth of the suburbs. As shown by Ford, the car changed the economic landscape. The efforts to resolve costs that have ensued from the influence of the car, such as pollution and fuel costs, will have a similar impact on the economic landscape. For instance, providing carpooling lanes to cars with multiple passengers has received attention as it helps reduce traffic. Sharing one or more cars between many people reduces the fixed costs per person and limits extraneous vehicles; the use of fleet vehicles affords savings through joint use of a set of autos by a very large group of persons either for business or pleasure. Since cars demand a high land use, they become increasingly uneconomic with higher population densities. This can either manifest itself in higher costs of driving in densely populated areas (parking fees and road pricing), or, in the absence of a price mechanism, in a shortage in the form of traffic jams.

Prior to that, he had been a captain in the \\"Independent Blues\\" Company of the 5th Maryland and served with the West Indies Squadron of the United States Navy against pirates. He was killed in the Battle of Monterrey on September 22, 1846. Reference in state song Watson is mentioned in the fourth verse of the official state song \\"Maryland, My Maryland.\\" The song was written in 1861, fifteen years later after Watson's death in Mexico, by James Ryder Randall while teaching in Louisiana, after hearing about the outbreak of rioting and loss of life as Massachusetts and Pennsylvania militia troops in Baltimore. The troops were marching between the President Street Station of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad west on Pratt Street to the Camden Street Station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to get to Washington, D.C. in response to President Abraham Lincoln's request for 75,000 volunteers and proclamation of a state of rebellion after the shelling of Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor in South Carolina on April 14, 1861, at the beginning the Civil War. This \\"First Bloodshed of the War\\" was also called the Pratt Street Riot. The \\"Maryland\\" song became a Southern battle hymn during the War and was later adopted as the official state song in 1939.

Postmark: September 17, 1907.Postcard number: 12198, National Trust Library Historic Postcard Collection, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries A monument to Watson exists at the corner of West North Avenue and Mount Royal Terrace in Baltimore near the old Gateway Entrance Pillars to Druid Hill Park where it was re-located in 1930. Previously, the Monument with its ten-foot bronze statue by famed local artist Edward Berge, (1876‚Äì1924), placed on a granite pedestal, flanked by two captured Mexican Army mortars was erected and dedicated in late September 1903, on the 57th anniversary of his death at the Storming of Monterrey in Mexico on September 22, 1846. Bronze plaques on either side of the pedestal record the names of those killed in the engagement, the surviving members of the Maryland Association of Veterans of the Mexican War, the deceased members of the Veterans, and the members of the Monument/Memorial Committee. It was unveiled by his sole surviving child‚Äîa daughter, Monterey Watson Iglehart, who was born on the day her father was killed. The statue was covered by the same U.S. flag that shrouded his body when it left Mexico to be transported home. The main speaker and orator for the ceremonies that day was Edwin Warfield (1848‚Äì1920), who was the founder (1890) and president of the influential Fidelity and Deposit Trust Company of Maryland (located in a landmark granite skyscraper headquarters, built 1894, at North Charles and West Lexington Streets (it was one of only a few tall older buildings which were not razed in the late 1950s and 1960s, during the re-development of the central business district known as Charles Center, and was still standing in 2013). Warfield was elected the next year as the 45th Governor of Maryland (1904‚Äì1908). Several other Baltimore and Maryland officials were joined by surviving veterans and their leaders along with representatives of other veterans groups from other wars. The original site of the Watson Monument when it was dedicated was at the intersection of West Mount Royal Avenue and West Lanvale Street, several blocks southwest of its later location. It was moved back then in 1930 because of a planned extension to the north of North Howard Street. References External links * Monument to William H.

Biography Helme was baptized on 24 July 1603 in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, England, the son of William Elme and Griselda Spratt, daughter of Richard Spratt of Barney, Norfolk, England. He arrived in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in July 1637, part of a group associated with the Reverend John Wheelwright, a clergyman from Lincolnshire who had arrived the previous year. Wheelwright and his sister-in-law Anne Hutchinson (a cousin of Christopher's stepmother, Priscilla Wentworth) quickly became embroiled in religious upheavals which caused considerable turmoil in the Colony. Governor Winthrop gave the group permission to remain in the Colony for only four months. In November 1637, the group settled into winter quarters at Piscataqua (Portsmouth, New Hampshire) and in May 1639 established the settlement of Exeter. Wheelwright and some of his followers left Exeter for Maine around 1643, shortly after the government of New Hampshire had been taken over by Massachusetts. At this time Christopher returned to Boston. In November 1643, two of his companions, Samuel Gorton and Richard Carder, were imprisoned for heresy and sedition by the Massachusetts authorities. In 1644, the Gortonists were banished from Massachusetts. It is likely that Christopher left Boston with this group. Gorton and a few friends bought land from the Narragansett Indians about twenty miles south of Providence, where they established Warwick. Christopher was appointed Town Sergeant, a role which required him to serve warrants, inform the town council of breaches of the law and civil disturbances, and to hold in custody those committed to his care. In August 1647, he was chosen as one of four to lay out lots and highways. In 1648, six men from each town in the colony (Providence, Newport, Warwick and Portsmouth) were chosen to be members of the Court of Trials. Christopher was one of the six chosen from Warwick. A year later, in January 1649, he was disfranchised for threatening the town in general and for going about to undermine it. Subsequently the censure was removed. In May of that year, he was charged in the death of a Rufus Barton, but was acquitted. However, the same court found him guilty regarding the \\"pretended purchase\\" of land in Warwick, for which he was fined. Christopher died in Warwick between his trial in May 1649 and December 19, 1650, when his widow Margaret sold the family home. He was about 47 years of age. A farmer who worked his own land, he left a considerable personal estate of ¬£1274, including a still valued at ¬£11. His cattle and swine were worth ¬£497, and his four \\"negroes\\" ¬£195. Legacy Helme left four young sons, William, Rouse, Samuel, and Christopher. William, the eldest, was probably not yet of legal age, since his mother Margaret disposed of the family property. Margaret continued to live in Warwick with her children after her husband's death, and is mentioned several times in the town records. One entry contains the following cryptic notation: \\"Ordered that for Divers considerations moving the Towne therunto they have accepted of Mrs Helmes to bee an Inhabitant & to have equal privilege with the rest of the Inhabitants notwithstanding any former order to the contrary.\\" Margaret and Christopher were likely married about 1639, perhaps in New Hampshire. Her maiden name may have been Rouse. Her second son was given that name, and it continued to be used for many generations in the Helme family. The Rouse family name was in use early in Maine and Massachusetts, with ties back to England. Among his descendants was George Washington Helme, a Confederate officer and tobacco merchant.

The military importance of the high ground has been recognized for over 2,000 years, citing early examples from China and other early-dynastic cultures who regularly engaged in territorial/power struggles. Later incorporated to be advantageous in architectural designs such as castles and fortresses which included towers and walls designed to provide structural advantages for positions of troops and weaponry which could be thrown or fired from above.  History  In Sun Tzu's The Art of War, military leaders are advised to take high ground and let the enemy try to attack from a lower position. Fighting from an elevated position is said to be easier for a number of tactical reasons. Holding the high ground offers an elevated vantage point with a wide field of view, enabling surveillance of the surrounding landscape, in contrast to valleys which offer a limited field of view. General Ji Ling of the late Eastern Han Dynasty used this principle to his advantage by sending lookouts to positions of higher-ground to scout for and provide early warning about enemy troops. Additionally, soldiers fighting uphill are assumed to tire more quickly and will move more slowly, when compared to soldiers fighting downhill, who do not have to struggle against the forces of gravity alongside natural obstacles in the terrain. Furthermore, soldiers who are elevated above their enemies can get greater range out of low-speed projectiles (such as rocks, javelins/spears, arrows, grenades, etc.), whereas low-speed projectiles have a shorter range when thrown uphill. Very steep and/or rocky terrain, like mountain sides, can be an obstacle to tanks and armored personnel carriers, or in the past to cavalry and war elephants. For example, in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, mujahideen guerrillas based themselves in the mountains of Afghanistan, thereby protecting themselves from the Soviet motorized divisions. This forced the Soviets to rely heavily on helicopters to conduct the war, but the United States gave the mujahideen FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which, arguably, combined with the defense of the mountains, was able to win the war for the mujahideen. The high ground and anti-aircraft missiles made it possible for the mujahideen to use guerrilla warfare against the Soviets without being wiped out. High ground was also employed in the 1423 Battle of Horic in Bohemia, where Taborite soldiers took to high ground, forcing the Utraquist cavalry to dismount to attack them, and also rendering their cannons ineffective. Taborite soldiers were eventually able to make a downhill charge and wipe out the remaining Utraquists. Here again, high ground played a crucial role in the outcome of the battle. However, getting the high ground is not always advantageous. In the Battle of Jieting of the Three Kingdoms period of China, Shu Han forces occupied a hilltop, which Cao Wei forces soon surrounded and isolated the Shu forces from water supplies and reinforcements. The Shu forces suffered a humiliating defeat, and the Shu northern expedition had to be aborted.

SMPTE STANDARD for Motion-Picture Film: Theater Projection Leader, Trailer and Cue Marks. Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY. Cue dots are also used as a visual form of signalling on television broadcasts. A pair of cue marks is used to signal the projectionist that a particular reel of a movie is ending, as most movies presented on film come to theaters on several reels of film lasting about 14 to 20 minutes each (the positive print rolls, themselves, are either 1,000 feet or, more commonly 2,000 feet, nominally 11.11 or 22.22 minutes, maximum, with more commonly an editorial maximum of 10 or 20 minutes). The marks appear in the last seconds of each reel; the first mark, known as the motor cue, is placed about 8 seconds before the end of the picture section of the reel. The second mark, known as the changeover cue, is placed about 1 second before the end. Each mark lasts for precisely 4 frames (0.17 seconds). Coded anti-piracy is a different kind of mark, used for watermarking to detect and prevent copyright infringement. Placement The exact placement of cues varies somewhat from lab to lab. According to SMPTE-301 (Theatre Projection Leader), there shall be 4 frames of motor cue, followed by 172 frames of picture, followed by 4 frames of changeover cue, followed by 18 frames of picture. That puts the motor cue at frames 198‚Äì195 from the end of the picture section of the reel (12.34 to 12.15 feet; or 12-foot-6-frames through 12-foot-3-frames), and the changeover cue at frames 21‚Äì19 from the end (1.31 to 1.18 feet; or 1-foot-5-frames through 1-foot-3-frames). As of January 2005, most domestic United States release prints follow this standard. According to SMPTE-55SMPTE 55‚Äì2000. SMPTE STANDARD for Motion Picture Film: 35- and 16-mm Television Release Prints ‚Äì Leaders and Cue Marks. Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY. (SMPTE Universal leader), there shall be 4 frames of motor cue, followed by 168 frames of picture, followed by 4 frames of changeover cue, followed by 24 frames of picture. That puts the motor cue at frames 200‚Äì197 (12.47 to 12.28 feet; or 12-foot-8-frames to 12-foot-5-frames) from the end of the picture section of the reel, and the changeover cue at frames 28‚Äì25 (1.75 to 1.56 feet; or 1-foot-12-frames to 1-foot-9-frames) from the end. Prior to January 2005, domestic United States release prints printed by Deluxe Laboratories (about half of domestic first-run major releases) followed this standard. Appearance Most cue marks appear as either a black circle (if the physical hole is punched out on the negative used to make the projection print of the film), or a white circle (if the mark is made by punching a hole or scraping the emulsion on the positive film print). They will also appear as an oval if the print is projected through an anamorphic lens. In order to make these marks appear clearer to the projectionist, the punched film is most often \\"inked\\" after punching by application of India ink, or a similar ink. The sample frames at the right have very fine inking. In the days of three-strip Technicolor, and successive exposure Technicolor cartoons, where separate silver images were available, it was not uncommon to apply two punches, one being larger and circular and the other being smaller and \\"serrated\\", with these being done in contrasting colors. Use Most projection booths in movie theaters in the past (and in some older theaters and studio screening rooms today) were equipped with two projectors side-by- side to project reels of film alternating between the two projectors. The cue mark was originally designed for such a setup. In such a system, the projectionist had a projector running the currently-playing reel (the outgoing projector) and a second incoming projector with the next reel to play, with each projector switching roles with each changeover. The projectionist would start the incoming projector with the changeover douser (shutter) closed as the first mark (the motor cue) appeared; the second projector would be threaded with the incoming reel parked 8 seconds (12 feet) of countdown ahead of the start of the picture section. The second mark (changeover cue) would alert the projectionist that the changeover was imminent, and one full second after the mark he would trigger a solenoid that would open the incoming projector and another solenoid that would close the outgoing projector. The audio would be switched at this time as well; the audio for a particular film frame appears 20 frames (about 15 inches) before the image, and so all film prints carry the first two to three feet of audio of the reel they precede at their tail, called a sound pullup (digital systems use different offsets before or after the image, which a computer corrects for). Film prints could be prepped by a projectionist with automatic changeover cues, which were small metallic appliqu√©s which could be applied to a print at the first cue mark. Readers attached to the projector would read the marks and execute the changeover sequence automatically, as long as the incoming reel was threaded properly on the second projector. However, most modern movie film projection systems have the film loaded on a very large horizontally-oriented platter (often colloquially known as a \\"cakestand\\"), in which all the reels of a movie are spliced together into one large contiguous wind of film filling the platter. Studios and preservation libraries that allow their archival or other rare prints to be exhibited typically demand that a twin projection system still be used so that their prints are not cut up for assembly. Such newer platter-based projectors would eliminate the need for cue marks, but the marks are still present on modern-day motion picture projection prints, mainly for older theaters and studio screening rooms still using 2-projector setups, and also to aid the projectionist in identifying reel ends during the splicing together of the reels onto a platter in newer theaters. In past years, certainly up to the late 1960s, cue marks were applied to the composited camera original negative, but no longer. Cue marks are now applied to the printing internegative, only, and these marks appear to be black, because the mark is made on a negative image, suitable for release print making, only. However, for many films, particularly those for which Academy consideration is anticipated, a special kind of film print, known variously as a \\"Showprint\\" (a trademark) or an \\"EK\\" (a generic name, after Eastman Kodak), is indeed made directly from the composited camera original negative. In these cases, the cue marks are manually applied to the finished film prints, and these marks appear to be white, because the mark is made on a positive image suitable for direct projection. A typical print run of such \\"Showprints\\" or \\"EKs\\" might be about five prints, with one being intended for a Los Angeles engagement (required by the Academy for its consideration), possibly one for a New York engagement, possibly one for the producer, possibly one for the distributor, and one for archival purposes. Other Cue dots in television In television, a similar idea is used to signal to a control room that a transition of some sort is about to occur on the broadcast (such as a commercial break). The most common type of television cue dot is the IBA style, used only in the United Kingdom, which consists of a small square in the top right corner of the screen, with black and white moving stripes. The other is a proprietary system used principally by the BBC (who do not air commercials). This version is a static square in the top left corner with a white-black-white pattern. In the early days of television, some stations used a puncher or a scriber on film prints. This was seldom accurate and not all stations used the same five second / one second pattern. Viewers were often treated to distortion just before station breaks in any film that had been around a while. Although the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers attempted to standardize television cues, its efforts went largely unheeded. The wide variety of telecine projectors (Eastman Kodak 250 on the high-end and RCA TP-16 on the low-end, for 16mm, and RCA TP-35 on the high-end and General Precision 35 on the low-end, for 35mm) significantly prevented any such standardization. In the past few decades, the cue dot was used extensively on the ITV and Channel 4 television networks in the United Kingdom as a commercial break was approaching. This was for the benefit of the regional playout centres who would need to run commercials for their broadcast areas. Automation and playout servers led to this being phased out and it is now used only for some live presentations, especially those with regional opt-outs or variable ad breaks. The cue dot appears about 1 minute before the break and disappears 5 seconds before the break starts. ITV use a spinning black-and-white ticker in the corner of the screen. In recent years, ITV have reduced usage of the cue dot to sporting events and other live broadcast programmes. The BBC's main purpose of cue dots was to cue the following programme, either from a studio or from an outside broadcast. Improvements in talkback and Presfax have made the BBC's usage of cue dots rare. The prevalence of digital television and the accompanying delays have made the use of cue dots to communicate with outside broadcast obsolete. Cue dots do have some other uses: presentation may be asked to \\"flash your dots\\" by an outside broadcast unit to confirm that their off-air check feed is correct, particularly when working regionally. The dots are also used during coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships to warn other broadcasters that the BBC feed will be cutting to an interview intended for the UK audience only, so they should be ready to go to something else.

At one point, one of the passenger railroad lines between Sacramento and San Francisco passed through Collinsville (before the bridges were built).

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game and as one of the most iconic Cork players of all time. Born near Barrack Street on the south side of Cork city, Horgan was introduced to hurling by his father, a county junior championship medal winner with Blackrock. He developed his skills at Sullivan's Quay CBS while simultaneously coming to prominence at underage levels with the Passage club, before transferring to Blackrock in 1968. Horgan went on to enjoy a hugely success career over the course of the next decade, becoming the only player to captain a team to three All-Ireland victories. He also won five Munster medals and five county senior championship medals. Horgan made his debut on the inter- county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Cork minor panel. From three successive All-Ireland final appearances he won one All-Ireland medal in 1967. He subsequently progressed onto the Cork under-21 team, winning back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1970 and 1971. Horgan made his senior debut for Cork in the Grounds Tournament in 1969, before later becoming a regular on the team during the 1969-70 league. Over the course of the next decade his blonde hair and his long, sweeping clearances from corner-back, made Horgan a cult hero in Cork. He won his first All-Ireland medal in 1970 before winning three championships in-a-row from 1976 to 1978. Horgan also won six Munster medals and four National Hurling League medals. As captain of the team in two separate championship campaigns, he also collected three All-Star awards between 1974 and 1978, while he was named Hurler of the Year in 1978. Horgan played his last game for Cork in June 1981. Between 1971 and 1980, Horgan lined out for Munster in six inter-provincial championship campaigns. He won two Railway Cup medals in 1976 and 1978. In retirement from playing Horgan became involved in team management and coaching. After coaching the Blackrock senior team during their unsuccessful 1982 championship campaign, he took a complete break from hurling for over a decade. Horgan returned as coach of the Douglas and Castleyons senior teams, guiding the latter to their first championship semi-final appearance in 2001. Horgan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most popular club and county hurlers of his era. In retirement from playing he has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at left corner-back on the Club Hurling Silver Jubilee Team in 1996 and the Supreme All-Stars team in 2001. Horgan was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all time in a 2009 poll. After battling illness for several years, Horgan died on 10 June 2016. His death was the first from Cork's 1976-1978 All-Ireland-winning three-in-a-row team. Playing career Club =Early years= Horgan began his senior club hurling career with Passage West in 1966. Horgan began his club hurling career with Passage West, however, after a largely unsuccessful juvenile and underage career he transferred to Blackrock in 1968. Horgan was just 21-years-old when he was chosen by his peers to captain the Blackrock senior team for the 1971 championship campaign. It was a successful campaign which led to the Rockies qualifying for their first county final in eight years. St. Finbarr's were the opponents and took a strong 2-0 to 0-2 lead after just eight minutes. A torrential downpour before the game made conditions very difficult and tempers boiled over with Simon Murphy and Charlie Cullinane being sent to the line. Blackrock fought back and a Ray Cummins goal in the 24th minute helped to level matters at the interval. Charlie McCarthy completed his hat-trick to give St. Finbarr's the lead early in the second half, however, Blackrock's youth and fitness were key in securing a 2-19 to 5-4 victory. Not only was it Horgan's first championship medal but he also had the honour of collecting the Se√°n √ìg Murphy Cup as captain. Due to the unsporting manner of the contest the Cork County Board later fined the two teams a combined total of ¬£30 and suspended five players, including Horgan, for a period of two months. This suspension had little impact on Blackrock's subsequent Munster Championship campaign, with Horgan being reinstated by the time his side faced Moyne- Templetuohy in the provincial decider. An impressive 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì1 victory gave him his first Munster medal. Blackrock subsequently qualified for an All- Ireland final meeting with rathnure on 14 May 1972. The Leinster champions were in arrears by twelve points at one stage, however, they launched a stunning comeback to cut the deficit down to one point. Blackrock stubbornly held on to secure a 5-13 to 6-9 victory. Not only was Horgan's first All- Ireland medal but he also had the honour of receiving the cup as captain. =National dominance= Blackrock surrendered their county, provincial and national titles the following year, however, they qualified for the county final once again in 1973. Reigning champions Glen Rovers provided the opposition and, after dominating the first half, held a 1-8 to 0-6 interval lead. Horgan had an outstanding second half and scored a trademark point from a 70-yards free. Blackrock held a point lead from the 55th minute and survived two Glen Rovers raids before securing a 2-12 to 2-10 victory. It was Horgan's second county championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents as Blackrock reached another Munster final. There were never more than a few points between the teams throughout the match, with Newmarket spurning a goal chance just before the interval. Blackrock held out for a narrow 1-13 to 0-14 victory and Horgan collected a second winners' medal. The All-Ireland final on 17 March 1974 saw Blackrock and Rathnure renew their rivalry once again. Dan Quigley netted the first goal for Rathnure, however, √âamonn O'Donoghue secured Blackrock's first goal seconds later when he kicked the sliotar over the goal- line. Half-time saw the sides retire having scored 1-7 apiece. Donie Collins put Blackrock ahead early in the second half, however, Quigley soon scored his second to restore parity. A ten-minute period of dominance by Blackrock yielded only three points, while Quigley completed his hat-trick with a goal from a 21-yards free to give Rathnure a one-point lead. Pat Moylan secured the equaliser. The replay on 28 April 1974 produced a tension-charged climax as Blackrock turned almost certain defeat into victory. The first half saw a number of unsavoury incidents, with John O'Halloran (Blackrock) and Mick Mooney (Rathnure) becoming the first players ever to be sent off in an All- Ireland club final. As the game entered stoppage time, Rathnure held a one- point lead. Blackrock's Donie Collins sent in a ground shot which goalkeeper Michael Foley let slip through his legs. √âamonn O'Donoghue secured the victory with a goal in the second minute of injury time. The 3-8 to 1-9 victory gave Horgan a second All-Ireland medal as captain. Once again back-to-back championship titles eluded the Rockies, however, they qualified for the county final in 1975. The game against Glen Rovers was expected to be an exciting affair, however, the expectation was not fulfilled. The half-back line of Frank Cummins, Horgan and Dermot McCurtain closed down the Glen attack and contributed greatly to the 4-11 to 0-10 victory. It was Horgan's third winners' medal at county level. The subsequent provincial decider saw Mount Sion provided the opposition, however, Blackrock were in impressive form. Horgan was the star at centre-back before having to retire late in the game with an injury. Ray Cummuns scored 3-3 as Blackrock powered to an 8-12 to 3-8 victory and a third Munster medal for Horgan. Blackrock entered the All- Ireland final on 14 March 1976 and got off to a great start as √âamonn O'Donoghue scored a goal inside the first minute. A goal from a Pat Moylan penalty in the 16th minute gave Blackrock a lead of 2-1 with James Stephens yet to score. The Village then made a vital switch as Joe Hennessy was moved from right wing-forward to right wing-back. By half time James Stephens had cut the lead to five points as they trailed by 2-2 to 0-3. James Stephens were transformed in the second half with their full-back and half-back lines repelling the Blackrock attack. A draw looked likely as the game entered the final stage, however, a last minute Mick Leahy goal put the game beyond doubt as James Stephens claimed a 2-10 to 2-4 victory. After defeat at the hands of Glen Rovers in 1976, it took Blackrock two years before they qualified for their next county final. Glen Rovers were the opponents once again, with the game remaining on an even keel for 40 minutes. Blackrock took over for the last period, winning the game by 4-12 to 1-7. It was Horgan's fourth championship medal and his third as captain of the team. Once again the Rockies stormed through the provincial championship and defeated Newmarket-on- Fergus by 3-8 to 1-8 in the decider, giving Horgan a fourth Munster medal. On 25 March 1979, Blackrock faced Ballyhale Shamrocks in the All-Ireland final. The first half was completely dominated by Horgan's side who opened the scoring with a goal from a 21-yards free by Pat Moylan in the first minute. Two further goals by Ray Cummins in the 17th and 18th minutes put Blackrock ahead by 3-2 to 0-2. A third goal by √âamonn O'Sullivan helped them to reach half-time in the comfortable position of being 12 points ahead. Blackrock appeared to have the game wrapped up when Tom Lyons whipped through a goal to leave them 14 points ahead with just a quarter of an hour left to play. Ger Fennelly pointed a free to reduce the deficit for Ballyhale, before Pat Holden, Kevin Fennelly and Liam Fennelly scored three goals without reply. Moylan pointed to reinforce the lead for Blackrock, however, a long shot from out the field landed in the Blackrock square before Brendan Fennelly got the final touch to send it over the line. The referee originally signalled a free to Blackrock, however, after consulting with his umpires he awarded the goal. This left the Shamrocks trailing by two points, however, they failed to score in the remaining time as the Rockies won by 5-7 to 5-5. For the third time in his career Horgan had captained his club to the All-Ireland title. =Decline= Blackrock qualified for their seventh county championship decider of the decade in 1979. St. Finbarr's provided the opposition in what was the sides' first final meeting since 1971. The Barr's took a one-point lead in the 20th minute after John Allen struck for a goal. Blackrock responded with a 1-1 from Frank Cummins and Tom Lyons. St. Finbarr's missed two gilt-edged goal opportunities in the second half, as Blackrock claimed a 2-14 to 2-6 victory. It was Horgan's fifth winners' medal in the championship. After missing Blackrock's 0-13 to 1-8 Munster final triumph over Dunhill, Horgan was returned to the team for the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. Castlegar of Galway shocked the reigning champions with a 2-9 to 0-9 defeat. Minor and under-21 Horgan made his Cork minor debut on 24 July 1966. Having played no part in the early provincial rounds, he was included at right wing-back on the Cork starting fifteen for the final against Galway. Liam Comer and Frank Keane did the damage in the full-forward line, scoring 4-1 between them, as Cork secured a 6-7 to 2-8 victory. It was Horgan's first Munster medal. After playing no part in the All-Ireland semi-final, Horgan was reinstated at centre-back for the All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966. Opponents Wexford justified their favourites' tag as, aided by a stiff breeze, they took a 4-6 to 2-3 interval lead. Bernie Meade launched the fightback for the Rebels, scoring 2-5 of the Cork total, as cork secured a 6-7 apiece draw. The replay on 16 October was also a close affair. Wexford only scored one point during the first 40 minutes as Cork seemed to have the title secured after scoring 1-7 in the same period. Wexford fought back and a four-goal blitz denied Horgan an All-Ireland medal after a 4-1 to 1-8 defeat. Eligible for the minor grade once again in 1967, Horgan was at centre-back as Cork qualified for a Munster final meeting with Limerick. Cork raced into the attack and were ahead by 3-3 to 0-2 at half-time. Horgan was described in the Irish Times as being the \\"outstanding player on view\\", and he collected a second successive winners' medal following a 4-10 to 0-3 victory. Cork later faced Wexford in the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1967. Horgan scored three trademark long-range points from centre-back and collected an All- Ireland medal as Cork avenged the 1966 defeat with a 2-15 to 5-3 victory. For the third successive year, Cork qualified for the Munster final in 1968. Horgan's side overwhelmed Waterford and ran out the easiest of 7-8 to 4-2 winners. It was his third Munster medal. On 1 September 1968, Wexford provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final. Cork led by 3-2 to 0-7 at half-time, however, Wexford fought back to take the lead with time running out. After using their allotted number of substitutes, Wexford played the last three minutes with only fourteen players after Larry Byrne had to retire injured. A 2-13 to 3-7 scoreline resulted in a second All-Ireland final defeat for Horgan. After failing to make the Corm under-21 team in 1969, Horgan was added to the starting fifteen as centre-back in 1970. Cork qualified for a Munster final meeting with Tipperary that year and, after a slow start, they took a 2-5 to 1-5 half-time lead. Paddy Ring top scored with 1-7 as Cork secured a 3-11 to 2-7 victory. It was Horgan's first Munster medal in the under-21 grade. Old rivals Wexford provided the opposition as Cork qualified for the All-Ireland final on 11 October 1970. Both sides couldn't be separated over the last 17 minutes, with Wexford's Mick Butler scoring a total of 1-10 in the 2-11 to 3-8 draw. The replay on 1 November 1970 was much more conclusive, with Cork blitzing Wexford with 4-4 just before half-time. Connie Kelly top scored for the Rebels with 2-7. The 5-17 to 0-8 victory secured an All-Ireland medal for Horgan. Horgan was moved to corner-back in 1971, as the Cork under-21 team set out to secure a remarkable fourth successive All-Ireland title. A 5-11 to 4-9 defeat of Tipperary gave Horgan a second successive provincial winners' medal. Once again Cork clashed with Wexford in the All-Ireland final on 12 September 1971, with the Leinster champions leading at several stages for three-quarters of the match. Full-forward John Rothwell scored four goals as Cork secured a 7-8 to 1-11 victory. In what was his last game in the under-21 grade, Horgan collected a second successive All-Ireland medal. Senior =Early success= Horgan made his senior debut for Cork on 12 October 1969 in a 1-15 to 1-3 defeat of Wexford in the semi-final of the Grounds Tournament. He became a regular starter throughout the subsequent league before making his championship debut in a 4-13 to 3-6 Munster semi-final defeat of Limerick. This victory qualified Cork for a Munster final meeting with Tipperary, in what was the first 80-minute provincial decider. Leading by eight points early in the second half, Tipperary had to play the majority of the match with fourteen men after Liam King was dismissed in the opening half. Cork laboured in attack, however, two goals from Willie Walsh and a third from Charlie Cullinane secured a narrow 3-10 to 3-8 victory. It was Horgan's first Munster medal. Cork subsequently qualified to play Wexford in the All-Ireland final on 6 September 1970. Horgan, at left corner-back, came in for praise with the other members of the full-back line - Tony Maher and Pat McDonnell - in quelling the Wexford attack. A record 64-point scoreline and eleven goals were produced in a sometimes ill-tempered and disappointing contest. Tony Doran top scored for Wexford with two goals, however, the day belonged to Eddie O'Brien who scored a hat-trick of goals for Cork from his hand. A remarkable 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10 score line gave Cork the victory and gave Horgan his first All-Ireland medal. A week after the All-Ireland victory, Cork travelled to the United States where they faced New York in the league final. Cork won the two-leg series of game on an aggregate score of 5-21 to 6-16, with Horgan adding a National Hurling League medal to his collection. =Team exclusion= As Cork began their defence of their championship titles in 1971, Horgan was moved to centre-back for Cork's opening game. He scored two points from that position, however, Limerick were the winners by 2-16 to 2-14. After falling out of favour with the Cork selectors in early 1972, Horgan was dropped from the team. He was added to the list of substitutes for the drawn Munster final with Tipperary before being dropped from the panel for all subsequent games. He was returned to the team for a league game against Clare in the opening rounds of the 1972-73 season, before regaining his place on Cork's championship starting fifteen. Horgan was appointed captain of the Cork team in 1974 and was at his customary position of left corner-back for Cork's league final meeting with Limerick. An √âamonn O'Donoghue hat-trick was one of the highlights for Cork, who routed their opponents by 6-15 to 1-12. It was Horgan's second league medal. A disappointing championship campaign followed for Cork, with Horgan being dropped from the panel once again after a loss of form. It was during his time off the team that Horgan collected his first All- Star award, a move which saw his return to the Cork panel. After a return to form, Horgan was included on Cork's championship panel in 1975. Cork qualified for the Munster final, however, Horgan, after an impressive display against Clare in the semi-final, started the match on the bench. He was introduced as a substitute and collected a second Munster medal as Cork defeated Limerick by 3-14 to 0-12. =Three-in-a-row= In 1976 Horgan was restored to Cork's starting fifteen where he occupied the centre-back position. Cork qualified for the Munster final once again, however, he had a tough game at centre-back against Limerick. Cork enjoyed a relatively easy 3-15 to 4-5 victory, with Horgan collecting a third Munster medal. After his poor performance in the provincial decider, Horgan was dropped from the starting fifteen in favour of Pat Barry for Cork's All-Ireland final meeting with Wexford on 5 September 1976. Cork got off to one of the worst ever starts in an All-Ireland final and they trailed by 2-2 to no score after just six minutes. Cork rallied to level the score at the interval, with Horgan being introduced as a substitute for Pat Barry in the 42nd minute. Wexford had a two-point lead with ten minutes to go, however, three points from Jimmy Barry-Murphy, two from Pat Moylan and a held effort from Ray Cummins gave Cork a 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 victory. It was Horgan's second All-Ireland medal. After an unhappy year at centre-back, Horgan was switched to his more natural left corner-back position in 1977. Cork qualified for a Munster final meeting with Clare, on a day when armed robbers made away with the takings from the gate of ¬£24,579 during the second half of the game. Clare conceded an early penalty but they fought back to take the lead. A contentious red card for full-back Jim Power turned the tide for Cork and they fought on win by 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì10, with Horgan collecting a fourth winners' medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 4 September 1977 was a repeat of the previous year as Wexford stood in the way of a second successive title for Cork. Se√°nie O'Leary played the game with a broken nose after being hit in the face by a sliotar in a pre-match warm-up while the two oldest men on the team, Denis Coughlan and Gerald McCarthy, gave noteworthy displays. Martin Coleman brought off a match-winning save from Christy Keogh in the dying seconds to foil the Wexford comeback. A 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 victory gave Horgan his third All- Ireland medal. His recall to the team was further vindicated when was presented with a second All-Star award in October of that year. Horgan retained the left corner-back berth in 1978, adding attack to the defensive position by scoring three points against Waterford in the Munster semi-final. The subsequent provincial final was a repeat of the previous year, with a bumper crowd of 54,181 in attendance to see Cork face Clare. Before the game even began, Horgan was in trouble as he got stuck in traffic and had to persuade some Garda√≠ to escort him through the huge crowds to the stadium. Cork‚Äôs attack in the first half was a shambles, hitting thirteen wides and only leading by 0-5 to 0-3. Cork came out a different team after the interval and took a five-point lead. Clare rallied, however, a last-minute goal chance by Ger Loughnane went inches over the bar. Horgan was Cork's second highest scorer with four points, and the narrow 0-13 to 0-11 victory gave him a fifth Munster medal. On 3 September 1978, Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final and the chance of securing a third successive championship. The game was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 victory over their age-old rivals. This victory gave Cork a third All-Ireland title in succession and gave Horgan a fourth All-Ireland medal. He finished off the year by being named the Texaco Hurler of the Year. =Final victories= For the second time in his career, Horgan was awarded the Cork captaincy for the 1979 season. Cork had a relatively easy passage through the provincial series of games, with Horgan winning a sixth Munster medal following a 2-14 to 0-9 trouncing of Limerick. This victory paved the way for Cork to secure a record-equalling fourth successive All-Ireland title, and for Horgan to become the first Cork player since Se√°n Condon in 1944 to captain Cork to the four-in-a-row. Age and the exertions of the three previous campaigns finally caught up with Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and a 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì13 defeat by Galway brought the four-in-a-row dream to an end. Cork regrouped during the 1979-80 league and qualified for the final against Limerick. Horgan was at left corner-back, however, a late Limerick goal secured a 2-10 apiece draw. He was confined to the substitutes' bench for the subsequent 4-15 to 4-6 replay victory. For the third time in ten weeks, Cork and Limerick faced each other, however, this time it was in the Munster final and Cork were hoping to achieve a record-breaking sixth successive title. A narrow and unexpected 2-14 to 2-10 defeat brought an end to Cork's championship campaign. For the second year in succession Cork qualified for the league decider with first-time finalists Offaly providing the opposition. Cork had scored 2-3 within the opening five minutes, however, Offaly fought back. Horgan scored two points from two 70-yards frees and collected his fourth league winners' medal following a 3-11 to 2-8 victory. Cork's championship campaign ended with a 2-15 to 2-13 Munster semi-final defeat by Clare. This was Horgan's last game for Cork as the recurrence of an Achilles tendon problem hastened his retirement from hurling. Inter-provincial Horgan won two Railway Cup medals in 1976 and 1978. Horgan was selected on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1971. He was at left corner-back as Munster faced Leinster in the final on 17 March 1971. Munster fell flat on the day, however, Horgan escaped any criticism with a great display in repelling the Leinster attack. The 2-17 to 2-12 score line resulted in defeat for Munster. After being excluded from the team for the next four years, Horgan was back on the starting fifteen as Munster faced Leinster in the 1976 final. With ten minutes remaining Munster held a seemingly unassailable 4-9 to 0-7 lead, however, Leinster launched a stunning comeback. Goals from Eddie Keher (two), Frank Cummins and Martin Quigley nearly sealed a remarkable victory, however, Munster held out for a 4-9 to 4-8 victory. It was Horgan's first Railway Cup medal. Horgan was selected for Munster again in 1977, as the southern province faced Leinster in the decider. While the standard of hurling was regarded as poor, Horgan gave a sound display in the full-back line once again, including scoring a point from 104 yards. A Leinster team dominated by Kilkenny and Wexford players secured a 2-17 to 1-13 victory. After receiving a bye to the 1978 final, Horgan was included at left corner-back as old rivals Leinster provided the opposition. Goals from Joe McKenna and Noel Casey proved the difference, with Horgan collecting a second Railway Cup medal following a 3-13 to 1-11 victory. Defeat in the semi-final was Munster's fate during the 1979 campaign, however, Horgan was included on the Munster team once again for the 1980 decider against Connacht. He played no part in the game as Connacht ended a 33-year wait for a Railway Cup title. Coaching career Immediately after retiring from hurling, Horgan took over as coach of the Blackrock senior team for the 1982 season. It was a relatively successful year as the Rockies qualified for the county final against St. Finbarr's. Veteran forward Ray Cummins scored a hat-trick of goals, however, Blackrock were overly-dependent on him. The Irish Examiner correspondent described the St. Finbarr's performance as \\"the finest he had ever seen in a county final\\", as they secured their third successive championship following a 2-17 to 3-9 victory. For much of the next twenty years Horgan played no part as a coach at either club or county level, however, he ended his self-imposed retirement when he took charge of the Castlyons senior team in 2001. Defeats of Ballincollig, Muskerry and Na Piarsiagh set up a semi-final meeting with Horgan's old club Blackrock. Castlelyons had never reached this stage of the championship before, however, it proved a bridge too far as the Rockies won before later claiming the championship. Horgan also enjoyed a term as coach of the Douglas senior team in 2006. Biography Horgan was born in the shadow of Elizabeth Fort on Barrack Street in 1950. John Horgan was born on 25 May 1950 at Barrack Street in the heart of Cork. He had one sister, Hilda, and in the early 1950s the family moved from the city centre to Passage West. Horgan was educated at Sullivan's Quay CBS where he developed both his hurling and academic skills. After spending much of his adult life working as a coal merchant, Horgan opened his own pub in Ringaskiddy in the early 1990s. He later ran a successful school of motoring in Rochestown. Horgan had suffered from Parkinson's disease for several years before his death on 8 June 2016. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Horgan (n√©e McCarthy) and four daughters; Gillian, Laraine, Debbie and Ashleigh.

The Imperial Army increased in size from about 111,000 troops in 1933 to an estimated strength of between 170,000‚Äì220,000 soldiers at its peak in 1945, being composed of Han Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Koreans, Japanese, and White Russians. Throughout its existence the majority of its troops were considered to be mostly unreliable by their Japanese officers and advisers, due to poor training, equipment, and morale.  History   Establishment  Military exercise of the Manchukuo Imperial Army Manchukuo Imperial Army generals After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in September 1931 and the creation of the puppet state of Manchukuo on 18 February 1932, they began raising an army to help them police the local population. The Manchukuoan armed forces were officially established by the Army and Navy Act of 15 April 1932 to maintain order in the new country. Former Qing dynasty emperor Puyi, who was later known by the era name Kangde upon his ascension to the throne of Manchukuo in 1934, had supreme command of the land, naval, and air forces. The Imperial Army's initial recruits came from the former Chinese Nationalist troops in the army of Zhang Xueliang, the warlord who had ruled Manchuria prior to the Japanese invasion. Large numbers of Chinese soldiers had surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army and were recruited en masse into the new Manchukuoan forces. About 60,000 of these troops gave themselves up and many more were later absorbed into the Imperial Army. Other recruits included local bandit groups and volunteers. Many of the Nationalist troops that formerly served under the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang had received poor training and had little loyalty to anyone, with a high proportion of them being opium addicts. As a result, the new force was regarded as mostly unreliable by the Japanese, who decided to employ the Young Marshal's former troops because they provided a numerically large and already-trained (albeit poorly) army. Their performance against bandit groups was dismal. It was reported that in May 1932 a unit of 2,000 Manchukuoan troops were \\"driven like sheep\\" by a group of outlaws they were operating against. Their lack of loyalty to the new regime was demonstrated by the significant number of mutinies that occurred in those years. In August 1932, a unit of about 2,000 men deserted their garrison at Wukimiho, taking their weapons over to the anti-Japanese guerrillas. Likewise, the entire 7th Cavalry Regiment revolted around the same time and joined the partisans as well. According to Japanese officers, there were many cases of Manchukuoan troops giving their weapons to the enemies they were sent to attack. In its first form the Manchukuo Imperial Army was organized in seven Provincial Guard Armies (one for each province), with a total of about 111,000 men. An Independent Cavalry Brigade was created to provide a garrison for the capital of Hsinking, and the Manchukuo Imperial Guard was raised in February 1933 from men of Manchu ethnic backgrounds as part of the capital garrison to provide protection for Emperor Puyi and senior government officials. The Japanese intended to replace the unreliable former troops of Zhang Xueliang with those trained by them and the government of Manchukuo as soon as circumstances permitted. As part of this effort, a new law signed in 1934 stated that only those trained by the Manchukuoan government could serve as officers. It was done to remove those former Nationalist officers who had been in the Young Marshal's forces and break the tradition of warlordism. In 1938, military academies were established in Mukden and Hsinking order to provide the Imperial Army with more reliable troops. A Central Training School for junior officers was opened in Mukden. The first class of 200 officer cadets graduated in November 1938, followed by 70 others in January 1939. Another class graduated in 1940, which included 97 cadets. After this, the number of native volunteers had dried up and the school accepted 174 Japanese recruits, who went on to serve in both the Manchukuoan army and the Japanese reserves. The military academy in Hsinking had its first class graduation in July 1938, which included 34 cadets. In addition, a signal school, medical school, and gendarmerie training school were established in Manchukuo. A military academy specifically for ethnic Mongols was established in 1934, taking in 100 cadets for a two-year course. The course included religious teachings and other classes to foster a patriotic Mongol spirit in the cadets. This first class graduated in the late 1930s. An important factor that allowed for the expansion of the Manchukuoan army was conscription. The Military Supplies Requisition Law of 13 May 1937 allowed the Manchukuoan and Japanese armies to conscript laborers, as well as allowing them to appropriate land and materials for the purposes of keeping order.Holland (2008), p. 84 The draft of soldiers did not begin until April 1940 and was not officially signed into law until 1941, which allowed every able-bodied male between the ages of eighteen and forty to be called up, of all ethnic groups. All youths were required to get a physical and then 10% of them were selected for service. Education, physical fitness, and their families' loyalty to the regime were things taken into consideration for selecting conscripts. When this was not enough, the Japanese forcibly drafted males from across the country into the army, and many efforts were taken to foster a Manchukuoan patriotic spirit among the troops.Jowett (2004), pp. 27‚Äì28  Counterinsurgency operations  Manchukuo Imperial Army officers Manchukuo Army marching band In its early years, the Empire of Manchukuo was home to many resistance groups that fought against it and the Japanese occupation forces. Many of those guerrilla fighters were civilians, but a great many were former soldiers of Zhang Xueliang's army that decided to continue to resist on their own rather than surrender or leave Manchuria. One of the more notable resistance leaders was Ma Zhanshan, whose army fought rearguard actions as the Young Marshal's main force retreated south. The Japanese were impressed with him and decided to recruit him by offering a large sum of money to the general. Ma initially accepted the offer from Colonel Kenji Doihara and briefly served as the state of Manchukuo's war minister. He used the opportunity to equip and arm his troops before deserting en masse to fight against the Japanese again.Jowett (2004), p. 18 The number of insurgents in Manchukuo swelled from 130,000 initially to more than 300,000. The problem became so severe that the Japanese launched a number of anti-guerrilla operations throughout the early and mid-1930s. The operations saw the usage of Imperial Army troops in support of the IJA and were largely successful, confining the remaining insurgents to the northeast of the country and greatly reducing their numbers.Jowett (2004), pp. 19‚Äì21 They were complicated by the fact that many of the Manchukuoan troops had little loyalty to their new regime and frequently switched sides, or warned the bandits of the coming attacks. These operations often involved a smaller vanguard of Japanese troops doing much of the fighting with a larger Manchukuoan contingent that played a supporting role. A law enacted in September 1932 titled \\"Provisional Punishment of Bandits\\" allowed for captured insurgents to be executed. The War Ministry of Manchukuo provided monetary rewards for officers of units that killed insurgents. The Imperial Army suffered significant casualties during the period from 1932 to 1935 during these operations, losing 1,470 killed and 1,261 wounded. The first campaign conducted by Manchukuoan troops independently of the Japanese did not occur until 1936, when some 16,000 men took part in fighting the 1st Route Army, capturing or killing more than 2,000 insurgents.Jowett (2004), p. 22‚Äì23 Some of the notable early operations that Manchukuoan troops were involved in included: *Subjugation of the Anti-Jilin Army (March‚ÄìJune 1932): A campaign undertaken by Japanese forces and several Manchukuoan units to clear out 20,000 Nationalist troops from the Jilin region. The units involved were the 7th and 8th Infantry Brigades along with the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Brigades, for a total of 7,000 men. Several ships of the River Defense Fleet also took part. The Nationalists were pushed back to the north of the province and the Sungari River was secured. *First Tungpientao Clearance (May‚ÄìJune 1932): When a Manchukuoan commander revolted and surrounded the Japanese consulate in Tungho a force of Japanese police was sent to relieve it, along with 1st and 2nd detachments of the Fengtien Guard Army as support. They totaled 4,000 men. Although the mutineers were forced to retreat, the Manchukuoan troops performed poorly and took considerable losses. *Ma Zhanshan Subjugation (April‚ÄìJuly 1932): A campaign that was launched against the headquarters of Ma Zhanshan. Manchukuoan forces numbered 5,000 men and included detachments from the Heilongjiang Guard Army. They fought alongside Japanese troops during the operation. The poor performance of the Manchukuoans during the fight allowed his guerrillas to escape. *Li Hai-ching Subjugation (May 1932): An attack launched by a force of 6,000 troops from the 1st Infantry and 2nd Cavalry Brigades of the Heilongjiang Guard Army, the 1st Cavalry Brigade of the Jilin Guard Army, and the 1st, 4th, and 7th detachments of the Taoliao Army. It fought against a group of 10,000 insurgents in the southern Heilongjiang province. The joint Japanese-Manchukuoan force successfully drove out the insurgents. *First Feng Chang-hai Subjugation (June 1932): A series of skirmishes between the units of the Jilin Guard Army and local guerrillas. Manchukuoan forces included the Jilin Railway Guards, Cavalry Corps and the 1st Infantry Brigade, in total 1,600 men. The Manchukuoans lost 150 men killed while claiming to have killed 1,000 guerrillas. *Second Feng Chang-hai Subjugation (June‚ÄìJuly 1932): An operation to clear out several districts from anti-Japanese fighters. The Manchukuoan contingent included units from the Taoliao and Jilin Guard Armies. The force totaled 7,000 men, and with Japanese assistance managed to drive out 15,000 insurgents. *Mongolian Bandit Subjugation Operation (August 1932): Mongolian bandits attacked the Ssutao railway line and captured a small town. A small force of Manchukuoans was sent to reclaim the area and forced the Mongolians to retreat. *Third Feng Chang- hai Subjugation (September 1932): A force of 7,000 men of the Jilin Guard Army attacked 10,000 bandits who were retreating from their earlier defeat in July. They were attempting to cross the border out of Manchukuo into the Chinese province of Jehol. Although they were surrounded, the majority of the bandits were able to escape. *Su Ping-wei Subjugation (\\"Machouli Incident\\") (September‚ÄìDecember 1932): A unit that had pledged loyalty to Manchukuo under Su Bingwen revolted against the Japanese. A force of 4,500 men took part in putting down the revolt and succeeded after heavy fighting, forcing Sun Bingwen to retreat into Soviet territory. Originally, the Manchu princess and soldier Yoshiko Kawashima wanted to negotiate with him, but the plans were cancelled. Japanese propaganda nonetheless published exaggerated tales of her exploits during the revolt.Birnbaum (2015), pp. 139‚Äì141 *Second Tungpientao Subjugation (October 1932): The Fengtien Guard Army cleared a district of guerrillas, killing 270 men and taking another 1,000 prisoner. About 8,000 Manchukuoan troops acted as support for a much smaller Japanese force. *Li Hai-ching Subjugation (October 1932): A group of 3,000 insurgents attempted to attack the south Heilongjiang province before a joint Manchukuoan-Japanese force launched a counterattack. It then retreated into the Jehol province. *Ki Feng-Lung District Subjugation (November 1932): An operation to clear the Ki Feng-Lung district of insurgents, involving about 5,000 Manchukuoan troops. *Third Tungpientao Subjugation (November‚ÄìDecember 1932): An operation launched to eliminate the remnants of the bandit groups that remained after the second subjugation campaign. It involved about 5,000 Manchukuoan soldiers. The operation was a success and resulted in the capture of 1,800 bandits, some of whom may have been recruited into the Imperial Army. *Kirin Province Subjugation (October‚ÄìNovember 1933): A large-scale operation that occurred in the Jilin province, attempting to free the entire region from insurgents and involving 35,000 Manchukuoan troops. It involved the whole of the Jilin Guard Army as well as units from several other formations. It was successful and led to the deaths of a number of prominent anti-Japanese leaders.  Defense of the border  Manchukuo Imperial Army cavalry When the Nationalist government refused for the Great Wall of China to become the new border between Manchukuo and China, the Japanese Kwantung Army launched an invasion of the Rehe province. Supporting this force were several units of the Manchukuo Imperial Army, which totaled about 42,000 men, under the command of General Zhang Haipeng. The fighting lasted just over a month, from 23 February to 28 March 1933. Western news reports wrote that some Manchukuoan units fought fairly well, with one detachment capturing 5,000 Chinese troops.Jowett (2004), pp. 25‚Äì27 When the Second Sino‚ÄìJapanese War broke out in July 1937, Nationalist Army units attacked Manchukuo, and in response the Imperial Army was partially mobilized. Several units were deployed along the border. Some clashes took place with Nationalist troops throughout August, and in most cases the Manchukuoans ended up being defeated. The arrival of a Japanese Colonel Misaki who took command of the Manchukuoan units improved the situation somewhat. Their performance improved during the campaign, but they took considerable losses nonetheless. The Imperial Army lost 60 killed and 143 missing in action.Jowett (2004), pp. 28‚Äì30 The Manchukuoan Imperial Army saw some action against the Soviet Union during the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, which played out largely in the Manchuria region. When the Battle of Lake Khasan occurred in the summer of 1938, Manchukuoan units were mainly used as reserves and saw little fighting, and reportedly some regiments mutinied during the battle. In May 1939, skirmishes broke out between the Mongolian cavalry (Mongolia was an ally of the Soviet Union) and Manchukuoan troops. The battle escalated as both sides brought in reinforcements and after four months of fighting the Battle of Khalkhin Gol ended up being a defeat for the Japanese and Manchukuo. About 18,000 Manchukuoans took part in the battle, mainly cavalrymen of the 7th and 8th Cavalry Regiments. They were initially held in reserve and were sent to the front line in July shortly after being reinforced to divisional strength. These units were positioned on the left flank of the Kwantung Army as it advanced towards the Khalkhin Gol river. The 1st Cavalry Regiment was then sent into battle in the northern sector in August as the situation deteriorated for the Japanese. Although the Manchukuoan units did not perform well overall, the Kwantung Army relied on them due to its desperation for manpower. After the conflict, the Japanese believed that the Manchukuo Imperial Army performed decently and saw reason to expand it.  Final years and defeat  Park Chung-hee as a regimental aide in the Manchukuo Imperial Army During the period from 1940 to 1945, the Manchukuo Imperial Army mostly saw action against Chinese Communist guerrillas. News reports at the time also continued to talk of the army's successful operations against bandits and posted recruiting announcements, being the only available public information about the army.Culver, Margaret S. \\"Manchuria: Japan's Supply Base.\\" Far Eastern Survey, vol. 14, no. 12, 1945, pp. 160‚Äì163. Most of the fighting was undertaken by elite units while the majority of the army was still considered to be too unreliable by the Japanese. The average Manchukuoan units were used for basic security and guard duties. Some attempts were taken to improve the army, however, and it did receive heavier artillery and armor from Japan. When the Soviets renounced their non-aggression pact with Japan, preparations began for the coming invasion of Manchukuo. Although the Kangde Emperor's army was reasonably well-trained and decently-armed by 1945 it was still no match for the much larger and more experienced Red Army. Its armored corps, consisting of some elderly tankettes and armored cars, did not compare to the much larger Soviet tank forces. The main strength of the Manchukuoan army by that time was its cavalry and that branch did see much fighting during the invasion.Jowett (2004), pp. 36‚Äì38 The Soviet invasion force taking part in the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation entered the state on 8 August 1945, consisting of 76 battle-hardened divisions from the European front, and including 4,500 tanks. The massive force easily swept aside both the depleted Kwantung Army and its Manchukuoan allies. In the early days of the assault small units of Manchukuoan cavalry saw action against the Red Army. When the Soviets reached Hailar they quickly forced the Japanese and Manchukuoan garrison in the city to surrender. The city of Fuchin fell on 11 August despite Manchukuoan and Japanese resistance, forcing them to abandon the city and retreat to the south and east. Other units in the region continued to fight until 13 August. The Manchukuoan 7th Infantry Brigade surrendered the city of Chiamu-ssu on 16 August. Manchukuoan cavalry on the right flank of the front engaged the Soviets and Mongolian troops in Inner Mongolia. On 14 August, this force defeated a small Manchukuoan cavalry unit on the way towards its objectives of Kalgan and Dolonnor. As the Soviets advanced, mutinies broke out in the capital of Hsinking and lasted from 13‚Äì19 August. Some Manchukuoan units rose up and killed their Japanese officers in revenge for the years of brutal treatment. A few Manchukuoan regulars and auxiliaries remained loyal and continued to fight on alongside the Japanese but they were the minority. Most of the Manchukuoan units melted away into the countryside after the first week or so unless they were stopped by their Japanese advisers. During the conflict, the Soviets captured 30,700 non-Japanese soldiers and killed about 10,000. Among those were 16,100 Chinese, 3,600 Mongolians, 700 Manchus and 10,300 Koreans. It is presumed that most of the Koreans were Kwantung Army auxiliaries while the rest were soldiers of the Manchukuoan Army (although some Koreans did serve in the Manchukuoan forces, such as former Chief of General Staff of the South Korean Army Paik Sun-yup and President of South Korea Park Chung-hee).Paik (1992), p. 80 Among those troops were also some White Russians. However, the majority of the former Manchukuoan Imperial Army remained in the countryside. Many of them joined the Communists since the Nationalists murdered those former Manchukuoan troops that they ran into, and as a result these former puppet troops provided an important source of manpower for the Communist Party in the region. Perhaps more importantly they also brought with them large amounts of weapons and equipment.  Weapons and equipment   Uniforms  Soldiers of the Manchukuo Imperial Army The Manchukuo Imperial Army's first military uniforms were indistinguishable from those of the local resistance groups forces and bandits, with Zhang Xueliang's former soldiers just continuing to wear Nationalist uniforms with yellow armbands to distinguish them. The problem was that it allowed soldiers on both sides to change their armbands, adding to the confusion. This issue was rectified by 1934, with new uniforms in a style similar to that of the Imperial Japanese Army, and using a color-code system on the collar badges (black for military police, red for infantry, green for cavalry, yellow for artillery, brown for engineer and blue for transport). The replacing of their old uniforms took place in the mid-1930s, and those who were stationed in the capital and big cities received new uniforms before those in the outlying towns. During the decade the Japanese-style uniform was gradually replaced with a unique Manchukuoan one.  Small arms  The early Manchukuo Imperial Army inherited a hodgepodge of weapons from the former Kuomintang arsenals of the Young Marshal, which created tremendous problems with maintenance and supply. For example, there were 26 kinds of rifles and over 20 kinds of pistols in use in 1932. In 1933, the number of guns in service was 77,268 rifles, 441 light machine guns and 329 heavy machine guns.Jowett (2004), pp. 15‚Äì17 A priority was made to unify weaponry around the 6.5√ó50mmSR Arisaka Type 38 Rifle as a standard, along with the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun and Type 11 Light Machine Gun in the same caliber. The conversion began in 1935, when 50,000 Type 38 Carbines were imported from Japan. Over the next two or three years, Japanese rifles and machine guns were graudally issued to infantry to replace the previous mix of Chinese models. By the start of the Pacific War, the process was just about complete and the weaponry of the Manchukuo Imperial Army was the almost same as the basic Japanese Army. Rear-line defense units and militias were however given captured Chinese and out-dated Japanese rifles. Military arsenals at Fengtien and Mukden were enlarged to produce rifles, machine guns and artillery, as well as repair them. Ammunition and small arms were also ordered from the private factories in Manchukuo. Artillery A Type 41 mountain gun during a training exercise, 1943 As with the small arms, the heavier equipment also initially came from Chinese sources. Due to the shortage of field artillery in the Nationalist Army the majority of the weapons confiscated from the Young Marshal's forces were light infantry and mountain guns. The most common among those were German and Austro-Hungarian mountain guns. By 1933 the number of artillery pieces being used was 281 infantry guns, 88 mountain guns and 70 field guns. The Japanese also issued their own artillery to the Manchukuoan army in an attempt to standardize its equipment. Many anti-aircraft guns were also used because of the potential threat of a Soviet invasion. *Type 38 75 mm Field Gun *Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun *Krupp mountain guns *Chinese 7 cm- caliber mortars *Chinese 75 mm field guns *Hand Grenade (stick type) *Type 10 Grenade Discharger *Type 88 75 mm AA gun Armored vehicles The Manchukuoan Imperial Army possessed a small and mostly underdeveloped armored force. Their tanks included 8 Renault NC-27 light tanks, 20 Carden-Loyd Mk VI tankettes, and possibly a handful of Renault FT light tanks left over from the Young Marshal's arsenals. The army received no tanks from the Japanese until the 1940s, when the IJA \\"loaned\\" a company of 10 obsolete Type 94 tankettes. They also fielded a varied of armored cars, among them some British and French models, along with 30 Japanese Type 92 Heavy Armoured Cars. The latter were mostly used by the armored branch of the military academy. Some armored cars were used mainly to transport troops during anti-bandit operations and performed well in that role.  Organization  There were two standard structures for a mixed brigade of the Manchukuoan Army. The first consisted of a headquarters, two infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, and one artillery company for a total of 2,414 men and 817 horses. The second consisted of a headquarters, one infantry regiment, one cavalry regiment, and one artillery company, totaling 1,515 men and 700 horses. Cavalry brigades likewise had two standard structures. The first was composed of a headquarters, three cavalry regiments, and an artillery company, for a total of 1,500 men and 1,500 horses. The second had a headquarters, two cavalry regiments, and an artillery company, for a total of 1,075 men and 1,075 horses. The standard structure of an infantry regiment included a headquarters, two infantry battalions, two machine gun companies, and two artillery companies, totaling 899 men and 117 horses. A cavalry regiment had a structure that consisted of a headquarters, three cavalry companies, and one machine gun company, for a total of 458 men and 484 horses. A training unit had a headquarters, teaching section, an infantry regiment, a cavalry regiment, an artillery regiment, and a cadet regiment, totaling 1,614 men and 717 horses.Jowett (2004), pp. 11‚Äì13 Those were their standard structures on paper, and given the disparity in the sizes of different units it is likely that those structures were not adhered to completely, if at all. A military adviser department existed under the Manchukuo War Ministry which assigned Japanese advisers to every Imperial Army garrison and district army. Due to the large number of former Nationalist officers in the Manchukuoan forces, they frequently came into conflict with their Japanese advisers. Eventually the Japanese officers were able to gain considerable control over Manchukuoan units.Jowett (2004), pp. 13‚Äì14  Ranks  Manchukuoan troops wore collar tabs that showed their rank. The system they used initially was the same as that of the Imperial Japanese Army, before the color on the tabs was changed to maroon in 1937.Jowett (2004), 111‚Äì113  Order of battle  ;1932 The early Manchukuo Imperial Army organization is listed below. Unit troop strengths are in parenthesis. The total strength of the Manchukuo Imperial Army at its foundation was 111,044 men, as many of the former Nationalist troops that had surrendered were deemed to be too unreliable by the Japanese were demobilized.Jowett (2004), pp. 7‚Äì9 *Fengtien Guard Army (20,541 men) ** Headquarters (678) ** Teaching unit (2,718) ** 1st Mixed Brigade (2,467) ** 2nd Mixed Brigade (2,104) ** 3rd Mixed Brigade (2,467) ** 4th Mixed Brigade (1,755) ** 5th Mixed Brigade (1,291) ** 6th Mixed Brigade (2,238) ** 7th Mixed Brigade (2,014) ** 1st Cavalry Brigade (1,098) ** 2nd Cavalry Brigade (1,625) *Jilin Guard Army (34,287 men) ** Headquarters (1,447) ** 2nd Teaching Unit (2,718) ** Infantry Detachment (1,163) ** Cavalry Detachment (1,295) ** 1st Infantry Brigade (2,301) ** 2nd Infantry Brigade (2,343) ** 3rd Infantry Brigade (2,496) ** 4th Infantry Brigade (3,548) ** 5th Infantry Brigade (3,244) ** 7th Infantry Brigade (2,343) ** 8th Infantry Brigade (2,301) ** 1st Cavalry Brigade (1,867) ** 2nd Cavalry Brigade (1,598) ** 3rd Cavalry Brigade (1,598) ** 4th Cavalry Brigade (2,037) ** Yilan Unit (706) ** North Manchuria Railway Guard Force (151) ** Sanrin Unit (1,452) *River Defense Fleet (640 men) *Heilongjiang Guard Army (25,162 men) ** Headquarters (1,016) ** 3rd Teaching Unit (2,718) ** 1st Mixed Brigade (3,085) ** 2nd Mixed Brigade (3,085) ** 3rd Mixed Brigade (3,085) ** 4th Mixed Brigade (3,085) ** 5th Mixed Brigade (1,934) ** 1st Cavalry Brigade (2,244) ** 2nd Cavalry Brigade (2,244) ** 3rd Cavalry Brigade (2,666) ** East Daxing'anling Guard Army (1,818) ** North Daxing'anling Guard Army (874) ** South Daxing'anling Guard Army (1,682) *Rehe Guard Army (17,945) ** Headquarters (301) ** Artillery Unit (854) ** Cavalry Unit (172) ** Infantry Unit (1,294) ** Chengde Area Forces (4,783) ** Chifeng Area Forces (3,414) ** Chaoyang Area Forces (3,977) ** Weichang Area forces (3,760) ** Seian Army (2,018) ;1934 In August 1934 the Manchukuo Imperial Army was reorganized into five district armies, each divided into two or three zones.

They reported the army had the following units: * 1st Division (3 infantry regiments, 1 artillery regiment) * 1st Guards Brigade (2 infantry regiments of 2 battalions, 1 mortar company) * 1st Cavalry Division (2 cavalry brigades, 1 battalion of horse artillery) * 10 Infantry Brigades (2 infantry regiments of 2 battalions, 1 mortar company) * 6 Cavalry Brigades (2 cavalry regiments, 1 battery of horse artillery) * 21 Mixed Brigades (1 infantry regiment, 1 cavalry regiment, 1 battery mountain artillery) * 2 Independent Brigades * 7 Independent Cavalry Regiments * 11 Artillery Units (one per District) * 5 Anti Aircraft Regiments ;1945 Sources differ on how many troops the Imperial Army fielded in 1945, ranging from 170,000Glantz (2003), p. 60 to 220,000.Jowett (2004), pp. 35‚Äì38 Its organization on the eve of the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation was as follows: * 8 infantry divisions * 7 cavalry divisions * 14 infantry and cavalry brigades  Special units   Manchukuo Imperial Guard  When Puyi first became the head of state of Manchukuo in 1932 with the title of \\"Chief Executive\\", several units were formed to defend him and the capital of Hsinking. Those included the Manchukuo Imperial Guards, charged with his personal protection as well as to serve as an honor guard on ceremonial occasions. The other was the Independent Cavalry Corps, formally the 4th Cavalry Brigade, which had taken part in the invasion of Jehol in March 1933. A special guard corps was also created in the Fengtien province, and eventually every province raised one. It performed well in combat. One of the more well-known irregular forces of the Imperial Army was an anti-bandit force of about 5,000 under the command of Yoshiko Kawashima, a Manchu princess and relative of Puyi.Jowett (2004), pp. 31‚Äì35  Mongolian Independence Army  In the early 1930s the Japanese formed a \\"Mongolian Independence Army\\" out of ethnic Mongols living in Manchukuo. The early source of recruits were mostly bandits and other undesirables, with Japanese advisers having total control over the new force. The early army had about 6,000 men in total divided into three armies of 2,000 men each. The army, once established, became part of the regular Manchukuoan Army as mainly a cavalry force. It later consisted of nine cavalry regiments and waged its own war against bandits independently of the Manchukuoans with some success, also taking part in the 1933 invasion of Jehol. In 1938 it was expanded to a size of twelve cavalry regiments, two artillery regiments, two independent mountain batteries and a motorized transport unit. Two years later it was completely integrated into the Manchukuoan army and dissolved, though Mongolian units continued to perform well in operations.  Korean Detachment  A special Korean detachment was formed in 1937 out of ethnic Koreans by a local businessman who was of Korean descent. The Japanese liked the idea as they believed Koreans had no loyalty to the Chinese and would be more dependable. All posts were filled in December 1938 and the first class of recruits arrived at a training center in 1939. It was initially small and consisted a headquarters, and infantry company and mortar battery, later being expanded with the addition of a second infantry company in 1940. The unit saw heavy action against Communist guerrillas and bandits, being regarded by the Japanese as a ruthless and effective unit. The detachment came to be known for its brutality and was one of the few puppet units that earned the respect of its Japanese superiors due to its martial spirit.  Asano Brigade  Following the Russian Civil War many White Russians ended up in Manchuria, and the Japanese decided to use this motivated anti-Soviet force. Conscription into the Manchukuo Army started in early 1940 and applied to all ethnicities, including Russians.Harmsen (2018), p. 112 They were initially used to guard railways and other important areas and the early success of the unit caused it to be expanded. However, the Japanese kept the White Russian troops under their direct command. They worked with the Russian Fascist Party of Konstantin Rodzaevsky to form this unit, and although there was one White Russian revolt in 1933, the Japanese considered them useful enough to keep employing them. In 1936 they were all unified into one detachment, the Asano Detachment or Asano Brigade, named after Colonel Asano Takashi, the Japanese adviser who organized it. The brigade was officially part of the Manchukuo army but it was led by Japanese officers. It grew from an initial strength of 200 men to 700 men divided into five companies. The brigade fought during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1938 and was almost totally destroyed. Another one was raised to replace it and it numbered some 4,000 men, including Cossacks, by 1945. During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria it took part in fighting against the Red Army and the fate of those who fell into Soviet captivity is unknown.Oberlander (1966), p. 166  Buryat soldiers  The Manchukuo Army also included ethnic Buryat troops among its ranks. Like the White Russians, many Buryats had fled their homeland in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War as well as during the political purges in the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia during the 1930s, in which many Buryats were targeted. A leading figure in the Manchukuo Buryat community was Urzhin Garmaev. Buryats between ages 20-30 were mobilized alongside other Mongols into the Hingan North Garrison Army, with two cavalry corps and a special railroad defense squadron under Urjin's command. Their duties included border patrol near Soviet and Outer Mongolian territory, and suppression of communist anti-Japanese guerillas. Buryat soldiers also participated on the Manchukuo side during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, after which the survivors were withdrawn to Hailar.

The initial hill fort of the Teutonic Knights (erected 1343) was replaced by a castle built in 1604-1610 by a noble Hungarian descent Janusz Eperjesz. The name ‚ÄúPanemunƒó‚Äú (‚Äûalong the Nemunas‚Äú, pronounced Pa ne mu‚Äò ne), it is guessed, arose from the former Panemunƒó Manor that was once here. Panemunƒó Castle was not designed to be a stronghold for the defence of the land but a typical, for the beginning of the 17th mentury, nobleman castle with defensive fittings, residential buildings, and farm buildings. Panemunƒó Castle became one of the most beautiful Renaissance era building in Lithuania. The castle was reconstructed around 1759 by Gie≈Çgud family. The new owners established lawish manor house like interiors with frescos, which has been recently discovered, while remaining wings of the castle is still under restoration. At present the castle is prepared for visitors. The castle stands in a park on a high hill and is surrounded by five cascading ponds. During a tourism season, works of Vilnius Art Academy are exhibited in the castle. It is possible to walk inside the castle, and admire the wonderful view that open from the castle tower.

Note the cork stopper is not in the water spout while water is being boiled, this is for safety reasons Kelly Kettle, Storm Kettle, Ghillie Kettle, Thermette and Volcano Kettle are trade names for portable devices for boiling water outdoors using twigs and other small combustible materials; these devices consist of a water jacket surrounding a fire chamber which creates an upward chimney draft ensuring efficient and rapid boiling even in windy or wet weather. Kelly Kettle and Volcano Kettle are registered trademarks of the Kelly Kettle company which first produced the product in Ireland in the early 1900s. George Marris & Co of Birmingham first produced the \\"Sirram Volcano Kettle\\" in England in the 1920s. The Thermette was first manufactured in New Zealand in 1929 and was standard issue for the New Zealand Army during World War II where it was known as a Benghazi boiler or Benghazi burner. Other companies, including the Eydon Kettle Company started manufacture at later dates. Earlier examples of water heaters using a water jacket include heavier samovar tea urns from Eastern, Central, and Southeastern Europe, as well as the Middle East. History convection current. Early examples (estimated at about 3,600 years) of devices that heat water surrounding a fire include samovar tea urns from Eastern, Central, and Southeastern Europe, as well as the Middle East. The Kelly Kettle Company first manufactured portable devices of this type four generations ago in the early 1900s. George Marris & Co of Birmingham (Brass Founders, Stampers and Piercers) first come to light in the 1800s making iron bedsteads and brass/copper fern pots. They diversified into picnic sets, picnic water- boiling sets and high-end shaving/toiletry sets in the 1880s (The Sirram Spirit Set Registered Design 247422 of Dec 1884) and Camping Stoves with their brand name \\"Sirram\\" (Marris backwards). There was a meeting between one of the Marris family and a New Zealander (almost certainly John Ashley Hart who started the Thermette Co in New Zealand in 1929 - see below) to discuss products and ideas. The original concept of the volcano kettle appears to have been Harts, but he may have been inspired by traditional Mongolian and Chinese hot-pots which had a central chimney. The first Sirram Volcano Kettle was manufactured out of spun copper with brass handles/fittings, it appeared in the late 1920s and was eventually covered by Registered Design No. 731794 of 1928. Subsequently, the design changed from copper/brass to spun aluminium, there is no record of when this change occurred. The Volcano Kettles were still in production in the late 60s as the book 'Modern Camping 1968: by Jack Cox' quotes a UK Consumers Association ('Which? Magazine') test of 21 camp stoves which concluded \\"For boiling water quickly or washing up there is nothing to beat a Sirram Volcano, either at home or abroad\\". Production of the Volcano Kettles and picnic boiling sets appear to have ceased in 1970 when Desmo Ltd purchased Hawker Marris Saled Ltd and discontinued the kettle range in favour of focussing on their picnic hamper range. Following the demise of the Sirram Volcano Kettle in 1970, modern versions are now in production by a number of companies around the world. The Thermette design was registered in 1929 in New Zealand by John Ashley Hart. It was standard issue to the New Zealand army serving in the North Africa during WW2 when it was known as the 'Benghasi Boiler'. In 1939 the New Zealand Army asked Hart to waive his patent so they could make their own Thermettes; he agreed and the device was issued as standard equipment to every small army unit. A modified version of the idea was created by the Eydon Kettle Company in the early 1970s and sold as the 'Storm Kettle'. Fixed (and portable) rocket stoves used for cooking were developed in 1980s; with variants for heating water and for space heating.

He acted in at least 42 Soviet films, and later appeared in several more after his immigration to the United States of America.  Early life  Savely Kramarov was born 13 October 1934 to Jewish parents: father Viktor Savelyevich Kramarov (–í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –°–∞–≤–µ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ö—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ä–æ–≤), a prominent Moscow attorney, and mother Benedikta Solomonovna \\"Basya\\" Kramarova (n√©e Volchek) (–ë–µ–Ω–µ–¥–∏–∫—Ça –°–æ–ª–æ–º–æ–Ω–æ–≤–Ωa \\"–ë–∞—Å—è\\" –ö—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞ (–í–æ–ª—á–µ–∫)). When young Savely was only three years old, the elder Kramarov represented some defendants in a widely publicized Soviet secret police case. Within a year Kramarov's's father was himself the victim of a \\"Stalinist purge\\"‚Äîhis crime, representing his clients too vigorously. Arrested and tortured to confess, Kramarov's father was sentenced to a term of eight years in the Soviet Gulag. Savely's mother was forced to divorce his convict father, and mother and son lived for a time in a communal apartment. Before Viktor Kramarov's prison term was up, young Savely's mother died, leaving him effectively an orphan. By a stroke of luck, she had managed to register him as Russian, not Jewish, on his domestic Soviet passport. Savely was once allowed to see his father prior to the elder Kramarov's exile in Biisk. During this meeting, his father, practically a stranger to him, told Savely that his Jewish faith that had sustained him in prison. In the 1950s, the once prominent attorney died in exile. Kramarov spent the remainder of his childhood in poverty, living with relatives, mainly his maternal uncles. During this time, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis; a Jewish physician helped him back to health. Education Seeking to follow in his father's footsteps with a career in law, Kramarov quickly found that door closed for the son of an enemy of the people. Instead Kramarov accepted an offer to technical school for forestry science. It was around this time Kramarov started acting. Kramarov did not attend formal acting school, at the State Theatre Art Institute, until 1972, well after achieving film stardom. At the same time as his late schooling for acting, he took up yoga, which attracted negative attention from the Soviet authorities.  Soviet stage and film career  Kramarov's first serious acting work was on stage in the late 1950s, in the lead role of Vasily Shukshin‚Äôs Vanka, How are You Here. Soon Kramarov was invited to act in Soviet cinema. His first film role was as Soldier Petkin in They Were Nineteen (Im bilo devyatnadtsat) (1960). By his second film, My Friend, Kolka!, Kramarov was well on his way to Soviet stardom. His goofy persona (in part a natural result of his being cross-eyed) delighted audiences. And he was a director's dream, dependably turning his lead roles into film-making gold. At the end of his life, Kramarov was asked to identify his favorite films he made; He named My Friend, Kolka!, The Elusive Avengers, The Twelve Chairs, Gentlemen of Fortune, It Can't Be!, and Big School-Break. But for all his fame and wealth, Kramarov recalled, his life was not whole. His religious identity learned from his family, which he had to hide in the Soviet Union, weighed on him. In 1979, he became a practicing Orthodox Jew; and he actively practiced his faith the rest of his life.  Emigration application and end of his Soviet career  It was at the height of his Soviet fame and fortune when Kramarov, in 1979, startled the Soviet authorities with his application for emigration. By this time he had made 42 films and was one of the Soviet Union's most popular film stars. His application rejected, Kramarov's films were suppressed nationwide; his film career was dead. He found his only outlet to continue acting was a theatre of refuseniks, where the passports of prospective audience members were checked on arrival at a performance. Not giving up hope, Kramarov next took up a campaign in Western news media to secure his coveted exit visa, going so far as to write to then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as from \\"one actor to another.\\" The Reagan letter was read multiple times on Voice of America radio. Upon finally being allowed to leave on 31 October 1981, Kramarov became persona non grata in the Soviet Union, like all celebrities considered traitors or enemies of the state. His name was removed from credits of all the films that he made so successful. Recalling a newly Kramarov-less Soviet Union, Oleg Vidov, another Russian actor who emigrated after Kramarov, noted, \\"The government took all of his posters down from the walls. They didn't want to have to explain why he left; it was easier just to forget.\\"  American film career and later life  Kramarov achieved only moderate success in American cinema, playing small Russian roles. Americans know him best, probably, for his role as a Soviet KGB handler in Paul Mazursky's Moscow on the Hudson, starring Robin Williams. Kramarov returned to his motherland only once, in 1992, following the break-up of the Soviet Union, as the guest of honour at a Russian film festival. After moving to Los Angeles in 1992, Kramarov missed the forests surrounding his native Moscow. He bought a home in a wooded area in Forest Knolls, Marin County, north of San Francisco, where he found freedom. In early 1995, Kramarov's American career was taking off; he had just landed a lead role in a new film.  Death  In March 1995, Kramarov underwent what is normally routine surgery to remove a bowel tumor. As unexpected complications, he suffered debilitating strokes and eventually endocarditis. Kramarov died at Pacific Medical Center Hospital in San Francisco on 6 June 1995, age 60. He was survived by his wife Natalia Siradze, as well as his daughter from a previous marriage, Basya (–ë–∞—Å—è) Kramarov. Thanks to the personal contributions of fellow former Soviet exiles of Kramarov's including artist Mihail Chemiakin, a unique gravestone containing \\"casts of [Kramarov's] comedy masks, scripts, [and] make-up brushes,\\" and his framed photograph was placed at the Jewish cemetery Hills of Eternity Memorial Park in Colma, California, in 1997. Of Kramarov, his rabbi, Joseph Langer, said, \\"He was a sincerely believing person, humble and kind\\" and \\"[He] was a holy goofball.\\"  Legacy  \\"Mr. Kramarov was perhaps the most beloved figure in the Soviet Union,\\" noted his former fellow Soviet actor Oleg Vidov. Kramarov's consistently-played version of a stock \\"Crazy Ivan\\" character \\"provided a veneer of protection in a totalitarian society. \\"When you're clever, the system kills you,\\" Vidov said. \\"When you're crazy, you can get away with things.\\" \\"[Kramarov] touched off a chain reaction of smiles every time he walked down a Moscow street...

The highway is located in Wisconsin's Driftless Area, and it passes through Crawford, Vernon, Richland, and Monroe counties. It runs from WIS 60 near Wauzeka north to US Highway 12 (US 12) and WIS 16 in Tomah. WIS 131 is maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). WIS 131 was designated in 1923 on a road between Ferryville and Gays Mills. It was realigned and several times in the next fifteen years, and it ultimately connected Wauzeka and Tomah in 1948. The highway was rerouted in northern Vernon County in the 1970s in expectation of a new dam on the Kickapoo River; however, when the dam project stalled in 1975, part of the rerouting between Rockton and Ontario was put on hold as well. WisDOT consequently performed very little maintenance on this section of WIS 131 for two decades after the dam project stopped, and it fell into disrepair. The state ultimately rebuilt the highway in the early 2000s, and the refurbished highway opened in 2003. Route description WIS 131 at its junction with WIS 171 in Gays Mills WIS 131 runs through hilly, rural terrain characteristic of the Driftless Area and Western Upland for its entire length. The route generally passes through farmland or wooded areas, though it also enters several small towns. WIS 131 begins in Crawford County at a 3-way intersection with WIS 60 northeast of Wauzeka and north of the Wisconsin River. The highway heads in a generally northward direction from the intersection toward Steuben. WIS 131 begins to follow the Kickapoo River here, running within the river's deep river valley through Wilton. The highway enters Steuben from the southeast and heads east as Farris Street toward another 3-way intersection with WIS 179. WIS 131 heads north from this intersection as Midway Street for about a block before turning east and leaving Steuben as Railroad Street. The highway turns north again outside of Steuben and passes through Barnum, Petersburg and Bell Center before intersecting WIS 171 in Gays Mills. North of Gays Mills, WIS 131 heads north- northeast toward Soldiers Grove. The route enters Soldiers Grove as Church Street before turning east onto Pine Street and intersecting US 61. WIS 131 becomes concurrent with US 61 and heads north into Vernon County toward Readstown. The concurrency between WIS 131 and US 61 is part of the National Highway System; this portion of WIS 131 and its short concurrency with US 14 are the only parts of the highway which are part of the NHS. WIS 131 and US 61 enter Readstown as Soldiers Grove Road and meet US 14 at a three-way intersection, where WIS 131 leaves US 61 and follows US 14 east for . WIS 131 then leaves Readstown to the north as 4th Street. Outside of Readstown, WIS 131 cuts east and passes through the community of Kickapoo Center before turning back north toward Viola. The highway enters Viola from the southwest as Commercial Street, passes Kickapoo High School and briefly becomes concurrent with WIS 56. WIS 131 enters northwest Richland County while in Viola, and it remains in the county for a short distance northward. After it returns to Vernon County, WIS 131 heads north toward La Farge. The highway enters La Farge from the south as State Street and follows WIS 82 west for four blocks before turning north and leaving the village as Mill Street. The road passes through the Kickapoo Valley Reserve north of La Farge and remains in the reserve for most of its length through Ontario. WIS 131 runs through unincorporated Rockton and bypasses Wildcat Mountain State Park to the west before entering the village of Ontario. The road crosses the Kickapoo River seven times on the between Rockton and Ontario. In Ontario, WIS 131 meets WIS 33 and follows the route east briefly before turning north and entering Monroe County. The highway heads north into Wilton, where it becomes concurrent with WIS 71. WIS 131 follows WIS 71 northeast out of Wilton as Walker Street, and the two highways are concurrent for . The two highways parallel the Elroy- Sparta State Trail for most of their concurrency, and the trail crosses over the roads before they separate at a 3-way intersection northeast of Wilton. WIS 131 heads due north from this intersection toward Tomah. Between Wilton and Tomah, WIS 131 is designated as a Long Truck Route by WisDOT; trucks are not subject to weight or length restrictions on this section of the highway. The highway intersects with Interstate 90 (I-90) in south Tomah and enters the city as Superior Avenue. This section of WIS 131 is the busiest of its entire route; according to WisDOT, the average daily traffic along this portion in 2006 was 7200 vehicles. WIS 131 terminates at a four-way intersection with US 12 and WIS 16 in southern Tomah; the road continues northward as US 12. History WIS 131 was first designated between 1924 and 1927 on a route from WIS 35 near Ferryville to WIS 11 in Gays Mills. When WIS 11 was assigned to a different route before 1927, WIS 131 took on its route from Gays Mills north to WIS 27 in Soldiers Grove. WIS 131 was extended further northward to La Farge in 1939 after a county highway was transferred to state control. In 1947, WisDOT switched the designations of WIS 131 and WIS 171 south and west of Gays Mills; WIS 131 was designated between Gays Mills and Wauzeka, and its original route between Ferryville and Gays Mills became WIS 171. WIS 131 was extended farther north to its current terminus in Tomah in 1948. The incomplete Kickapoo River Dam in 1975, when construction stopped In the 1970s, the state government planned to dam the Kickapoo River between La Farge and Ontario. As WIS 131 crossed the river eleven times between these towns, the state had to relocate the highway as well. The first section of WIS 131 to be moved, between Ontario and Rockton, was realigned away from the river onto a route built to the east between 1978 and 1981. The original section of the highway was abandoned so the dam could flood the area. This section was later turned into a recreational trail in the Kickapoo Valley Reserve. The portion of WIS 131 between Rockton and Ontario was supposed to be moved east as well; the new highway would run north past Rockton to a realigned WIS 33, which it would follow into Ontario. The state built the first half-mile of this new route, but construction stopped on the new highway after the dam project was suspended after a cost-benefit analysis. The dam project ultimately failed, and the community did not resolve several land ownership issues until 2000. This pushed back any plans to resolve the relocation of WIS 131, and the road between Rockton and Ontario consequently received little to no maintenance during the intervening period. The state first planned to complete the proposed relocation of the highway, but residents and environmentalists opposed this plan, and it eventually fell through. The state then planned a $20 million project to rebuild the existing stretch of WIS 131 instead; plans for this project were finalized in January 2000. Environmentalists tried to stop this plan as well, and the Kickapoo Valley Stewardship Alliance sued WisDOT, claiming it had violated the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 and the Transportation Act of 1966. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin struck down the lawsuit, and construction continued on the road. The improved section of WIS 131 was completed and dedicated in August 2003.

He played in midfield for Tottenham Hotspur, Swindon Town and West Ham United. While at White Hart Lane he went on loan to Doncaster Rovers, Cambridge United, Portsmouth, Brentford and Ipswich Town. Career After playing in Tottenham's reserve side and having been loaned to several clubs, Swindon Town manager Glenn Hoddle signed Moncur for ¬£80,000 fee, towards the end of the 1991/92 season. Swindon Town He made his debut as a substitute in a 1‚Äì0 win over Port Vale on 4 August 1992, his full debut coming four days later, in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Millwall. Moncur started the following season in the side, but injury spoiled most of the season; he made only fourteen appearances in the league, three of which were as a substitute. Returning to fitness before the play-off campaign started he rejoined the squad in place of Micky Hazard. Moncur played in the three play-off games ‚Äî scoring a goal in the second leg of the semi-final at Tranmere Rovers, which helped assure Swindon's place at Wembley in the 1993 Football League First Division play-off Final. Moncur was almost ever-present in Swindon's Premier League campaign, missing just one game. He scored Swindon's first ever goal in the top flight, a 25-yard free-kick in an opening day 3‚Äì1 defeat at Sheffield United. In a notorious incident, Manchester United's Eric Cantona became frustrated when Moncur held him back after losing the ball, and stamped on Moncur's chest, an offence for which Cantona received a red card. At the end of the season, with Swindon relegated, Moncur signed for West Ham for ¬£1 million in June 1994. West Ham United Moncur joined West Ham United in the summer of 1994 to bolster their midfield. Originally regarded as a classy midfield playmaker with a good passing ability, similar in style to Hammers' teammate Ian Bishop but with a combative style that often saw him in the referees' notebook. Moncur's first goal for West Ham came in a 2‚Äì1 away victory over London rivals Chelsea on 2 October 1994. He ended his first season with three goals in 35 appearances. He was often a substitute for West Ham, particularly in his later career and was used sparing and strategically for the Hammers. Injuries further limited his appearances. Despite this, he became something of a cult figure at Upton Park due to his committed attitude and occasional flash of brilliance as well as reports of his humorous off- field antics. An indication of his popularity came in a fiery London derby against his former club Tottenham Hotspur on 24 April 1999 when he was sent off for two bookable offences, the latter a bad foul, and clenched his fists in defiance to the travelling West Ham supporters. West Ham eventually won the match 2‚Äì1. He was dismissed three times during his West Ham career. Another memorable moment occurred when Moncur scored during West Ham's 5‚Äì4 victory over Bradford City in 2000 at Upton Park when Moncur scored with a rising drive from outside the penalty area, falling over as he did so. He then ran over to the West Ham fans and took his shirt off in celebration. When the celebrations died down, Moncur was unable to put his shirt back on and was seen running up the pitch with his shirt still only partially on and was, therefore, out of position as Bradford hit another goal immediately from the restart. This goal was his last for West Ham. Moncur's last appearance came in a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Arsenal on 19 January 2003 away at Highbury. West Ham were relegated at the end of the season and Moncur retired from football after having played in the Premiership for 10 consecutive seasons. Personal life Moncur is a devout Christian having turned to religion during his footballing career in order to help him deal with his anger. He has two sons who are also footballers; George currently plays for Luton Town F.C., and Freddy plays for Margate, both as midfielders.

Among the features were historical exhibits, futuristic space-themed areas, rides, sports and games. It also featured a roller coaster called the Stratoboggan, which was a major draw.

He gained nationwide popularity in the former Soviet Union with the emergence of a series of 1960s comedies by director Leonid Gaidai. He played the role of the Coward among a trio of colorful, scheming characters in such Gaidai movies as Bootleggers (1962), Operation Y and Other Adventures of Shurik (1965), and Kidnapping, Caucasian Style (1967). The last two subsequently beat the Soviet all-time record of ticket sales. The trio of actors, including the late Yuri Nikulin and Yevgeny Morgunov, was \\"the most popular ensemble in the history of the national cinema.\\" In 1990, he was awarded the top artistic title of the Soviet era, that of People's Artist of the USSR.

Maclean was born in Guelph, Ontario. She obtained a 3-year Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario. From 1941 onwards she worked for the British Security Coordination in New York City. After being posted to Panama, she met and married John Wood, though the couple would divorce in 1951. On her way to New York City in 1941, Maclean had met Sheena Govan, and it was through her that she would later meet Peter Caddy. Living in England in the 1950s, Maclean became involved in the spiritual practices of Govan and Caddy and eventually Eileen Caddy. When the Caddys were appointed to manage a hotel in Scotland, Maclean joined them as the hotel's secretary. After the Caddys became unemployed in 1962, they moved into a caravan near the village of Findhorn. In 1963, an annex was built so that Maclean could continue to work with them. A community eventually grew up around the Caddys and Maclean, and this community has since 1972 been known as the Findhorn Foundation. Maclean was known for her work with devas, said to be intelligences overseeing the natural world. Her book To Hear the Angels Sing gives an overview of this work and also provides autobiographical materials. A full-length biography, Memoirs of an Ordinary Mystic was published in 2010. Maclean left Findhorn in 1973 and subsequently founded an educational organization in North America with David Spangler. Her childhood home, Woodside, at 40 Spring Street, Guelph has since been designated a heritage property under the Ontario Heritage Act. Maclean retired from public life in 2010 and lived again at Findhorn. She turned 92 years old during Findhorn Foundation's 50 Year Anniversary celebration in 2012. She turned 100 in January 2020https://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/happy-100th-dorothy-189104/ and died shortly after on March 12, 2020, in Findhorn.

The most turbulent halny blows in Podhale region of southern Poland, coming from the south, down the slopes of the Tatra Mountains; in Slovakia, on the other side of the mountains, it comes from the north. Halny is a warm windstorm that blows through the valleys. It is often disastrous; ripping off roofs, causing avalanches and, according to some people, can have some influence on mental states. Most halny occur in October and November, sometimes in February and March, rarely in other months. In May 1968 a destructive halny known as Wind of the Century where winds reportedly reached 288 km/h, destroyed large areas of forestry in southern Poland. See also *Oroshi References Notes # A note attempting to provide the English comprehension of halny, which lacks a one-word translation: Halny is a singular masculine noun in Polish (plural: halne) when denoting the wind. Wind is of masculine gender in Polish: wiatr. The terms halny and wiatr halny are synonymous. Halny is also a general masculine adjective derived from the feminine noun hala, a grassy meadow typical of the higher elevations of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. The feminine singular adjective is halna, while the neuter singular and the plural for all three genders of the adjective is halne.

It was directed by Michael Caton-Jones and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff, Robert De Niro as Toby's stepfather Dwight Hansen, and Ellen Barkin as Toby's mother, Caroline. The film also features Chris Cooper, Carla Gugino, Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire. Plot In the 1950s, nomadic and flaky Caroline Wolff wants to settle down and find a decent man to provide a better home for herself and her son, Tobias \\"Toby\\" Wolff. She moves to Seattle, Washington and meets Dwight Hansen, a man who seemingly meets her goals. However, Dwight's true personality is soon revealed as being emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive to Toby while Caroline is away for a few weeks. The marriage proceeds, and Caroline and Toby move into Dwight's home in Concrete, a small town near the north Cascades Mountains. Dwight's domineering personality is soon apparent, but Caroline remains with him, enduring several years of a dysfunctional relationship. During this time, Toby befriends a classmate named Arthur Gayle, a misfit at school and ambiguously gay. Toby wants to leave Concrete and live with his older brother, Gregory, (who lives on the East Coast with their father). Toby plans to apply for scholarships at East Coast prep schools by submitting falsified school records. Meanwhile, Arthur and Toby's friendship becomes strained when Arthur accuses Toby of behaving more like Dwight. Arthur helps Toby to falsify his grade records. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted by The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia with a full scholarship. Later, Caroline defends Toby from Dwight during a physically violent argument; they both leave Dwight and the town of Concrete. (Note: The real Dwight died in 1992.

First National Pictures bought her for the sole purpose of blowing her up in The Half-Way Girl. In June 1925, under the supervision of the United States Coast Guard, the Corvallis, now renamed for the film as the Mandalay, was towed offshore, loaded with dynamite, and blown up while the cameras rolled. After the explosion, the stern remained afloat and had to be sunk by the United States Coast Guard.

Its plot follows six people who seek shelter during a storm in the mansion of an elderly puppetmaker and his wife, only to find that the various puppets and dolls in the home contain the imprisoned spirits of criminals. It was produced by Charles Band and Brian Yuzna, through Band's Empire Pictures. The film grossed $3.5 million worldwide against a budget of $2 million. Plot A violent thunderstorm strands young Judy, her father David, and her stepmother Rosemary in the gothic English countryside. Seeking shelter, the trio break into a nearby mansion, where they meet the owners, a kindly older couple named Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke. Learning that Judy has \\"lost\\" her beloved doll Teddy (in fact, the cruel Rosemary threw Teddy into the bushes), Gabriel gives Judy a Mr. Punch doll. Three more people arrive at the mansion, also seeking shelter from the storm: good-natured Ralph and English hitchhikers Isabel and Enid. Gabriel invites them all to stay the night. Judy soon discovers that the mansion is full of beautifully detailed dolls like Mr. Punch; Gabriel explains that he is a toy maker. Judy is overjoyed, as is Ralph, who is something of a child at heart. Isabel and Enid are actually petty thieves who hitchhiked with Ralph intending to pick his pocket. That night, Isabel sneaks out of her room to rob the mansion. Instead, she is brutally attacked by dolls. Judy, in the hallway, briefly sees the attack, and she rushes to tell her father David. However, David is a neglectful and uncaring father, and he and Rosemary accuse Judy of making up stories. Instead, Judy convinces Ralph to check out the hallway with her. Ralph is initially very skeptical, but he eventually believes Judy after her Mr. Punch doll speaks. Rosemary is later attacked by the dolls; to escape them, she leaps out of a window to her death. Enid searches for Isabel and finds her almost entirely transformed into a doll version of herself. A horde of toys attack and kill Enid. Meanwhile, as dolls gather around Ralph and prepare to attack him, Judy convinces them to spare him because he is her friend. David finds Rosemary's dead body, and believes that Ralph killed her. Now safe from the dolls, Judy and Ralph enter the workshop, where the irrate David finds them. Ralph tries to explain the danger the dolls pose, but David knocks both his daughter and Ralph unconscious. The Mr. Punch doll then comes to life and attacks Ralph. Other dolls drag the unconscious Ralph and Judy away to safety, as Mr. Punch is destroyed by David after a fierce struggle. The Hartwicke appears and explain that they are actually a wizard and witch who see toys as the heart and soul of childhood. Gabriel and Hilary dislike the bitterness of adults, and when people seek shelter at their mansion, the dolls serve as a test for the visitors. People like Ralph, who appreciate the joy of childhood, and children are spared and leave the house with a fuller appreciation of life. However, those who refuse to change their ways can never leave; they are themselves turned into dolls. As the Hartwickes explain this, the incredulous David transforms into a doll to replace Mr. Punch. The next morning, the Hartwickes convince Ralph and Judy that the night's events were just a dream. Gabriel reads a fake letter from David explaining to Judy that he and Rosemary are changing their names and leaving the country with Enid and Isabel. Judy will be able to stay permanently with her caring mother in Boston. Gabriel gives Judy and Ralph money to buy plane tickets to Boston. Ralph and Judy leave the house, and as they drive away, Judy hints to him that if he would like to stay with her and her mother, he could be Judy's new father. Ralph seems interested in the idea. The film ends with dolls of David, Rosemary, Enid, and Isabel sitting on a shelf while outside another car with a set of obnoxious parents gets stuck in mud near the mansion. Cast Cancelled sequel Stuart Gordon was, at one point, very interested in directing a sequel to this film. The initial storyline would have followed Judy and Ralph back to Boston in which Ralph would have indeed married Judy's mother and they would all become a family. Until, one day Judy would receive a box sent from England which would contain the toy makers, Gabriel and Hilary, as dolls. The sequel never happened.

Morgunov reportedly received a reply from Stalin that said that a place was allocated for him in the acting class at the State Institute of Cinematography. Morgunov launched his film career while still a student. Career Yevgeny Morgunov was one of Russia's leading comic actors.Soviet- Era Comic Screen Legend Dies. Valeria Korchagina. The Moscow Times. No. 1738. June 29, 1999. \\"Plump and bald,\\" Morgunov often \\"represented a traditional character of Soviet satire - Byvaly, or Experienced, a slightly dull, strong- built drunk whose attempts to commit petty crimes always failed.\\" Although his acting career was not limited to comedies, he was best known for his work in a comic trio in a series of films by Leonid Gaidai, with Yuri Nikulin as Fool (Balbes), and Georgy Vitsin as Coward (Trus). Their best-known films together were Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures and Prisoner of the Caucasus, or Shurik's New Adventures. Morgunov's character named Experienced (Byvaly) was always the \\"tight-lipped and aggressive leader of the group\\". Reportedly, \\"the three symbolized exactly what Soviet men were not supposed to be - drunk, unemployed and inclined toward mischief.\\" In one of the legendary scenes in Prisoner of the Caucasus Experienced gives lessons on how to dance the twist - by putting out cigarette butts with his feet. However, after his triumphant role of ‚ÄúByvaly‚Äù Morgunov was not much into filming. His best works included those in films Three Fat Men (Tri tolstyaka) (1966), Ilf and Petrov Went by Tram (Ekhali v tramvaye Ilf i Petrov) (1972). There were also other, less noteworthy roles. Morgunov also tried his wings as a film director. As early as 1962, he directed the comedy When the Cossacks Weep (Kogda Kazaki plachut) under the patronage of the illustrious writer Michail Sholokhov. However, the film remained his only director‚Äôs work.

The band enjoyed a somewhat renewed appreciation from critics on Hand It Over. However, in the years following the band's hiatus, Hand It Over would become hard to find due to it not having the initial strong sales of Where You Been and Without a Sound which both sported moderate radio hits.

The expression is used in contradistinction to \\"Seminary priests\\", by which was meant priests ordained at Douai in northern France, at Rome or in other English seminaries on the European mainland.Burton, Edwin. \\"Marian Priests.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 9 August 2019 History Shortly after Queen Elizabeth I's accession, Roman Catholic ordinations ceased altogether in England, in consequence of the imprisonment of the church's surviving bishops, and unless the Seminary priests had begun to land in England to take the place of the older priests who were dying, the Roman Catholic priesthood would have become extinct in England. There was an important distinction between the Marian priests and the Seminary priests in the fact that the penal legislation of the rigorous statute 27 Eliz. c. 2 only applied to the latter who were forbidden to come into or remain in the realm under pain of high treason. Therefore, the Marian priests only came under the earlier statutes, e.g. 1 Elizabeth c. 1 which inflicted penalties on all who maintained the spiritual or ecclesiastical authority of any foreign prelate, or 5 Eliz. c. 1 which made it high treason to maintain the authority of the Bishop of Rome (i.e. the Pope), or to refuse the Oath of Supremacy. Dom Norbert Birt has shown that the number of Marian priests who were driven from their livings was far greater than was commonly supposed. After a careful study of all available sources of information he estimates the number of priests holding livings in England at Elizabeth's accession at 7500 (p. 162). A large number, forming the majority of these, accepted, though unwillingly, the new state of things, and according to tradition many of them were in the habit of celebrating Mass early and of reading the Church of England service later on Sunday morning. But the number of Marian priests who refused to conform was very large, and the frequently repeated statement that only two hundred of them refused the Oath of Supremacy has been shown to be misleading, as this figure was given originally in Sander's list, which only included dignitaries and was not exhaustive. More than half of the Maran clergy resigned or were deprived at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign.Brigden, Susan. London and the Reformation, Clarendon Press, 1989, p. 577 Dom Norbert Birt has collected instances of nearly two thousand priests who were deprived or who abandoned their livings for conscience' sake. As years went on, death thinned the ranks of these faithful priests, but as late as 1596 there were nearly fifty of them still working on the English mission. Owing to their more favourable legal position they escaped the persecution endured by the Seminary priests, and only the Venerable James Bell is known to have suffered martyrdom.

H. Auden. Auden refused to title his early work because he wanted the reader to confront the poetry itself. Consequently, his first book was called simply Poems when it was printed by his friend and fellow poet Stephen Spender in 1928; he used the same title for the very different book published by Faber and Faber in 1930 (2nd ed. 1933), and by Random House in 1934, which also included The Orators and The Dance of Death. The privately-printed 1928 edition of Poems was of \\"about 45 copies\\", as its limitation page obscurely states. It is one of the great rarities of twentieth century literature. The 1930 commercially published edition of Poems appeared from Faber and Faber in 1930, having been accepted by T. S. Eliot; it was printed in an edition of 1,000 copies. Only a small number of the poems in the 1928 version survived into the 1930 volume. Written in a gnomic, seemingly obscure style, the poems and the play Paid on Both Sides included with them, were extraordinarily influential. The compression of their style, their presentation of a personality \\"frustrate and vexed\\" that could be seen as a metaphor for the zeitgeist of a country‚Äîplainly England, struck a wholly new, modernist note. Not allusive like Eliot's The Waste Land (1922), the numbered poems in the volume, as well as the play, were as difficult and rich as that work but, unlike it, seemed to come from a person speaking in a private but significant code. The impression derives from the density of rhetorical device, but some of it also comes from the author's stoic, detached attitude toward his own intense emotional life. Some of these mannerisms were copied in the work of Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis. For this reason critics dubbed these contemporary writers, who also saw England in parlous condition, as \\"the Auden generation.\\" In 1933, when Poems was reprinted, Auden replaced seven of the poems in the 1930 edition with poems that he had written during the year 1930, after completing the 1930 version of the book. Auden revised or dropped many of the poems in the 1933 edition for the collections and selections that he prepared in the 1940s and later. The 1934 edition, published by Random House, was Auden's first published book in the United States. The publisher included all three of the books that Auden had published in the UK in this volume. For a few readers and critics, such as Randall Jarrell, the 1930 and 1933 versions remain Auden's greatest achievement. References *W. H. Auden: A Bibliography, by B. C.

Two commandos take on an entire army with many weapons, and defeat bosses to advance levels. Plot Snake and Eagle, two commandos of the Bloody Wolf special forces, receive instructions from their commander to destroy the enemy's weapon base and rescue any allies who have been reported missing in action, as well as the President. In the Battle Rangers version, their commander is a Secretary of State and the instructions are simply \\"save the top urgent crisis of our nation.\\" In the end, the Colonel tells Snake and Eagle that their next mission is to rescue the President once again; however, after having decided to \\"party it up tonight\\", the men decline to take the mission and abandon the Colonel. Gameplay Player battling Green Soldiers (arcade version) The game uses a side-view and employs a multi- directional attack method similar to many other arcade games of the run and gun genre, including Guerilla War, Ikari Warriors, Mercs and Data East's own Heavy Barrel. Allowing up to two players to play simultaneously, once players create their own codename using up to three initials, they receive a quick mission briefing before the mission ensues. Players automatically begin the game with a machine gun containing unlimited ammo and a knife used exclusively for close quarters combat. The mission's levels are separated into \\"scenes\\" and usually consist of one or more players running through various terrain, attacking hordes of enemy soldiers, and reaching the end of the stage to battle a boss. Players have the option to rescue various hostages scattered throughout the levels to obtain new weapons or items. Ports The game was ported to the PC Engine (known as the TurboGrafx-16 in North America) by Data East in 1989, and published a year later in the US by NEC. The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 version retains much of the same gameplay elements, level designs, enemies, and items as the arcade version. Differences between the Arcade and PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 versions * Player names: Both versions allow the players to create their own codenames as a name entry. However, the default codenames of the two commandos in the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 version are Eagle and Snake, respectively. * Numbers of players: The arcade version allows up to two players to play whereas its PC Engine/Turbografx-16 counterpart offers only a single-player mode with the option to play as either Snake or Eagle. * Levels: The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 version contains one additional level, making its total to eight. * Mission objectives: The mission briefing in the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 port differs slightly by attempting to provide some type of backstory and changing the scenario. The player receives information that the enemy has kidnapped the President and the mission is to rescue him. * Dialogue: Interaction between the player and hostages generates much more dialogue in the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 version. * Music: Though the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 had a more limited soundbank, the music was greatly enhanced to support full length catchy tracks. Toto's \\"White Sister\\" was redone in arcade game style and used in one of the sequences of gameplay when rescuing the fellow mercenary. * Items: The \\"Rosary\\" from the arcade version was renamed to \\"Lucky Rabbit's Foot\\" in the TurboGrafx-16 version. * Level design: The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 version contains much larger levels. Reception The game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #164 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. They gave it 3¬Ω out of 5 stars.

Bkan 1 was one of the world's heaviest and most powerful self- propelled artillery vehicles in use during its service. It had a 155 mm autocannon with an exceptionally high rate of fire, being able to fire 14 shells in less than 45 seconds. With one round already loaded in the gun beside the two seven-round clips in the magazine, the rate of fire rose to an official world record of 15 rounds in 45 seconds. The magazine could then be reloaded with a built-in hoist in about 2 minutes. Each shell had a weight of 47 kg and a tactical range of 28 km. Its chassis was based on a lengthened Stridsvagn 103 with one extra road wheel. The first variant, the Bkan 1A, used the same engine as the first Strv 103's and was thus somewhat under powered since that engine was designed to drive a 30-ton tank unlike the Bkan 1 which weighed over 50 tons. Despite this its mobility was more than adequate for its role as an artillery piece.  Use  The plan was to produce about 70 vehicles, but due to cuts in defence budget only 26 bandkanon 1s were manufactured. They were used as divisional artillery in Norrland, used by Boden Artillery Regiment and later Norrbotten Regiment. They were organized in two battalions of 12 vehicles each until the late 1980s and after that, three battalions of 8 vehicles each until the bandkanon 1 was discontinued in 2003.  History  When the KRV tank project was cancelled, the chassis was developed by AB Landsverk under the designation Artillerikanonvagn 151 (Akv 151). As the concept seemed promising, the self-propelled gun was re-designed by Landsverk under supervision of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration to use the same drive train as the S-tank and a main gun constructed by AB Bofors. Bandkanon 1 appeared in two versions, the original version was Bandkanon 1 (later designated Bandkanon 1A). After modification done to the vehicle during the 1980s, the new version was designated Bandkanon 1C. The main difference was the introduction of a drive train more similar to the one introduced on the new \\"C\\" version of Stridsvagn 103, other modifications were the removal of the built-in ammunition crane and the introduction of the POS 2 system for navigation, positioning and directing.

As Florence Carroll, she obtained her AB and MA in French literature at the University of Chicago (1920) where she was co-editor of The Chicago Literary Monthly, and student of Richard Atwater. They married in 1921 and had two children, Doris (1922-2000) and Carroll (1925-2013). After her husband's stroke in 1934, Florence Atwater started teaching high school French, English and Latin, and wrote short pieces for The New Yorker, Woman's Home Companion and The Atlantic. She submitted her husband's original version of Mr. Popper's Penguins to two different publishers but it met with no success. She rewrote parts of the book and the revised version was accepted by Little Brown and published in 1938 to great success. Mr. Popper's Penguins won the Newbery Honor Award in 1939 and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. It has been translated into many languages, and has never been out of print.

Richard Atwater suffered a stroke in 1934 which left him unable to speak or write. He had finished a manuscript of a book he called \\"Ork! The Story of Mr. Popper's Penguins\\", inspired by a documentary about Richard E. Byrd's Antarctic expedition that he had seen with his family in 1932.

The game is built on the CloakNT 3D engine. It was re-released on Steam and GOG.com in 2011. Plot The game takes place in the future, when humanity has inhabited Mars. A coalition of 36 top industrial corporations establish the MARSCORP consortium in 2036 with the goal of terraforming the planet. In 2042, MARSCORP has become the de facto autocratic government of Mars, with its director Samuel Longwood being a ruthless dictator. Meanwhile, Graham Castor's highly elusive rebels seek to liberate Mars. The game's protagonist wakes up in the medical bay of the space station HMS Majestic, which is under attack by unknown assailants looking for him. Having recovered a gun, he fights his way to an escape pod and flees, moments before the station explodes. The escape pod crashlands into the fictional city of Montack somewhere in the United States, where the news of the Majestic massacre has preceded him. According to the television, he is a notorious Martian rebel called John Chaser. A wanted man, he is recruited into the Vallero crime family, which is at war with the local Yakuza chapter. The family implants a small remote-controlled bomb into each of its member to ensure their loyalty. As such, on the eve of an attack on Yakuza headquarters (Hotel Nippon), Chaser secretly visits a Japanese hacker in the Yakuza-controlled part of the city to remove the bomb. While receiving weapons and ammo, Chaser hides the bomb inside Vallero's limousine. Shortly afterwards, Vallero learns of Chaser's unauthorized foray into Yakuza territory and detonates the bomb, killing himself. Chaser disappears after killing all of Vallero's men, the Yakuza leaders and scores of Yakuza gunmen. By this time, Chaser has had recovered a few vague fragments of his memory: On Mars, a vehicle full of armed men, lead by the fearsome Scott Stone, attack the building in which Chaser was, gunning him down and taking away his body. Chaser contacts Kabir, a smuggler who promises voyage to Mars in exchange for Chaser escorting Kabir's contraband to Siberia. There, Kabir betrays Chaser and shoots him several times. According to an elderly eyewitness, just as Kabir is about to finish Chaser, an armed man in black scares him and his men away and injects Chaser with a medicine. Having recovered, Chaser attacks a local labour camp and rescues a man who can lead him to Kabir's base of operations, an old spaceport. After killing Kabir and his men, Chaser departs to Mars. On Mars, Chaser is thrown in prison, where he meets one of his old comrades. They orchestrate an escape plan, which, unbeknown to them, is seen and heard by Longwood himself. Once they escape the prison, they make contact with one of the rebels who informs them that Longwood has been rerouting terraforming money into his own projects, including illegal human cloning and memory transfer. They orchestrate a plan of assassination in which they blow up a train carrying Longwood. With Longwood officially announced dead, the rebels return to their base to celebrate, only to be attacked by Longwood's forces. After an extended gunfight, the base is overrun and both Chaser and Castor are captured. Longwood, alive and well, reveals that the protagonist is, in fact, Scott Stone. The real John Chaser died before he could be interrogated. Aboard the Majestic, Stone assumes Chaser's appearance through plastic surgery. Castor's men, however, attacked the Majestic and disrupted the memory transfer process, leaving left him amnesiac. Castor admits to being responsible for the attack, but vehemently denies all else and pleads with the protagonist not to join Longwood. Eventually, the protagonist shoots Castor dead.

Bronevoy graduated from the Alexander Ostrovsky Tashkent Theatrical Art Institute. After his graduation in 1950 he worked in Magnitogorsk and Orenburg drama theatres. In 1953, Leonid took a chance and went to Moscow where he was able to immediately enter the third year of the Moscow Art Theater School (class of A.M. Karev) and successfully complete it in 1955. After finishing the School-Studio, the actor left Moscow and got in Grozny Drama Theatre. Then there were the Irkutsk , and Voronezh . From 1962 to 1988 he was the leading actor of the . Since 1988 - in the Moscow Lenkom Theatre. First all-Union popularity Bronevoy got after playing the 45-year-old Muller role in the TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring. He created the image of Gestapo chief - not primitive, sadistic bonecracker as the Gestapo is often portrayed in Soviet films, but a normal person with a sense of humor, simple manners and not too scrupulous attitude to the official ideology, but an intelligent, skilled professional and a dangerous enemy. And that image got striking, memorable, provocative and even respect for sympathy. Many replicas of television Mueller became popular expressios. Another equally popular character of Bronevoy was the Doctor from the film Formula of Love. An elderly experienced man, for which there is nothing surprising in the world, and nothing that could shake his confidence in the correctness of his views on life. Many phrases Doctor pronounced with the Bronevoy's intonation, became popular meme. The same applies to the role of the artist's pop band Velyurov from The Pokrovsky Gate. In subsequent years the actor had played more than twenty roles in the movies. The last was the role of an old actor in Zhuravlev's film, Simple Things, for which he received the Nika Award in March 2008. His name appeared on a petition against Russian accession of Crimea, however, he himself stated in an interview that his name was placed without his permission, and that he, in fact, supports Vladimir Putin and Russian actions in Crimea.–õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥ –ë—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–≤–æ–π –∏ –ú–∞—Ä–∫ –ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–æ–≤ –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª–∏ –≤ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫—É –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –≤ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã / He died in a hospital on 9 December 2017, one week before his 89th birthday.

She was a concubine of Emperor Xuanwu, and she became regent and empress dowager after her son Emperor Xiaoming became emperor after Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515. She was considered to be intelligent but overly lenient, and during her regency (interrupted by a period (520-525) where her overly trusted brother-in-law Yuan Cha seized power), many agrarian rebellions occurred while corruption raged among imperial officials. In 528, she was believed to have poisoned her son Emperor Xiaoming after he tried to have her lover Zheng Yan (ÈÑ≠ÂÑº) executed. This caused the general Erzhu Rong to attack and capture the capital Luoyang. Erzhu threw her into the Yellow River to drown. As Emperor Xuanwu's concubine It is not known when the future Empress Dowager Hu was born. Her father Hu Guozhen (ËÉ°ÂúãÁèç) was the hereditary Earl of Wushi, but appeared to carry no imperial offices initially after he inherited the title in 491. Hu Guozhen's sister was a well-known Buddhist nun, and she often preached inside the palace of Emperor Xuanwu, himself an avid Buddhist. On one of these lecture stints, which lasted several days, she told Emperor Xuanwu's attendants of her niece's beauty. When Emperor Xuanwu heard of this, he decided to take Hu Guozhen's daughter as a concubine‚Äîas an imperial consort of the rank Chonghua (ÂÖÖËèØ). Because Consort Hu's aunt was a Buddhist nun, she also became well-versed in Buddhism. She was also said to be literate and capable of making quick decisions. Because of Northern Wei's tradition that when a crown prince is created, his mother must be put to death, the imperial consorts often prayed that they only wished to give birth to princes who would not be crown prince or princesses, not the crown prince. However, Consort Hu prayed differently‚Äîparticularly because Emperor Xuanwu lacked a son at this point‚Äîthat because she did not want to see the empire without a crown prince, she was willing to do so. Eventually, she became pregnant, and her friends inside the palace suggested that she have an abortion. She refused, saying that she would rather die if she could be the mother of the crown prince. in 510, she gave birth to a son, Yuan Xu. Because Emperor Xuanwu had lost several sons by this point, he carefully selected experienced mothers to be Yuan Xu's wet nurses, and prohibited, for a while, either Consort Hu or his wife Empress Gao from seeing him. In 512, Emperor Xuanwu created Yuan Xu crown prince, but, abolishing the custom of putting the crown prince's mother to death, spared Consort Hu. In 515, Emperor Xuanwu died suddenly, and Yuan Xu succeeded him (as Emperor Xiaoming). He initially honored Empress Gao as empress dowager, and gave Consort Hu the title of Consort Dowager. Empress Dowager Gao wanted to put Consort Hu to death, but she was protected by the officials Yu Zhong and Cui Guang (Â¥îÂÖâ), the general Hou Gang (‰æØÂâõ), and the eunuch Liu Teng (ÂäâÈ®∞). Yu and the imperial princes Yuan Yong the Prince of Gaoyang and Yuan Cheng (ÂÖÉÊæÑ) the Prince of Rencheng soon seized power from Empress Gao and, after ambushing and killing Empress Gao's powerful uncle Gao Zhao, replaced Empress Gao as empress dowager with Consort Hu. Empress Dowager Hu became regent over the five-year-old emperor. First regency Empress Dowager Hu was considered intelligent, capable of understanding many things quickly, but she was also overly lenient and tolerant of corruption. For example, in winter 515, the corrupt governor of Qi Province (Â≤êÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Yuan Mi (ÂÖÉË¨ê) the Prince of Zhao Commandery, provoked a popular uprising when he killed several people without reason, and while he was relieved from his post, as soon as he returned to the capital Luoyang, Empress Dowager Hu made him a minister because his wife was her niece. In Yuan Xu's childhood, Empress Dowager Hu's power, during these few years, were unchallenged, and while she tolerated‚Äîand, in certain circumstances, encouraged‚Äîcriticism, including rewarding such officials as Yuan Kuang (ÂÖÉÂå°) the Prince of Dongping and Zhang Puhui (ÂºµÊôÆÊÉ†) for their blunt words, she was slow to implement suggestions that would curb corruption. Empress Dowager Hu was a devout Buddhist, and during this part of the regency, she built magnificent temples in Luoyang. One she built, dedicated to her father Hu Guozhen, whom she had created the Duke of Qin, after his death in 518, was particularly beautiful. Because of her influence, Emperor Xiaoming also became a dedicated Buddhist. In 519, a serious riot occurred in Luoyang, after the official Zhang Zhongyu (Âºµ‰ª≤ÁëÄ) proposed that the civil service regulations be changed to disallow soldiers to become civilian officials. The soldiers became angry and stormed both the ministry of civil service and the mansion of Zhang Zhongyu's father, Zhang Yi (ÂºµÂΩù), killing Zhang Yi and seriously injuring Zhang Zhongyu and his brother Zhang Shijun (ÂºµÂßãÂùá). Empress Dowager Hu arrested eight leaders of the riot and executed them, but pardoned the rest, to quell the unrest. She also rejected the proposal to change the civil service regulations. This event is often seen as the turning point and the start of the unrest that would eventually tear Northern Wei apart. Despite these events, Empress Dowager Hu continued to tolerate corruption, and she often gave exuberant awards to officials, draining the treasury; the pressure on the treasury and the burden on the people were further increased by her orders that each province was to build a tower dedicated to Buddhas. Sometime before 520, Empress Dowager had forced Emperor Xiaoming's uncle Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÊáå) the Prince of Qinghe, who was popular with the people and the officials because of his abilities and humility, to have an affair with her. Yuan Yi thereafter became the effective leader of government, and he tried to reorganize the administration to decrease corruption. He particularly tried to curb the powers of Empress Dowager Hu's brother-in-law Yuan Cha and the eunuch Liu Teng. Yuan Cha therefore falsely accused him of treason, but he was cleared after an investigation. Fearful of reprisals, Yuan Cha and Liu convinced Emperor Xiaoming that Yuan Yi was trying to poison him and carried out a coup against Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Yi, killing Yuan Yi and putting Empress Dowager Hu under house arrest. Yuan Yong became titular regent, but Yuan Cha became the actual power. House arrest by Yuan Cha Yuan Cha was not particularly able as a regent, and he and Liu multiplied their corruption once they were in power. Yuan Cha himself was not dedicated at all to the affairs of state, but spent much of his time on feasting, drinking, and women. He put his father Yuan Ji and his brothers into positions of power, and they were just as corrupt. Yuan Cha's incompetence and corruption, together with the level of corruption that Empress Dowager Hu herself tolerated while in power, led to popular dissatisfaction with the regime and many agrarian revolts, although the first revolt was by a non-agrarian‚ÄîYuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁÜô) the Prince of Zhongshan, who was friendly with both Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Yi‚Äîin fall 520, trying to avenge Yuan Yi and restore Empress Dowager Hu. Yuan Cha quickly had Yuan Xi's rebellion suppressed. In spring 521, the general Xi Kangsheng (Â•öÂ∫∑Áîü) made an attempt to restore Empress Dowager Hu, but failed. Yuan Cha had him put to death. In 523, the official Li Chong (ÊùéÂ¥á) saw that the people of the six northern military garrisons, largely ethnic Xianbei, who had for generations been forced to stay at those garrisons to defend against Rouran attacks, were stirring with discontent, and he suggested to Yuan Cha and Emperor Xiaoming that the garrisons be converted into provinces and that the people be given the rights of the people of other provinces. Yuan Cha refused. Later that year, the people of Huaihuang (Êá∑Ëçí, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei) and Woye (Ê≤ÉÈáé, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia) Garrisons rebelled‚Äîrebellions that Northern Wei forces could not quickly quell, and the rebellions soon spread throughout not only the six garrisons but throughout virtually the entire empire. In 525, Yuan Faseng (ÂÖÉÊ≥ïÂÉß), the governor of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, modern northern Jiangsu), who had been a close associate of Yuan Cha, believing that Yuan Cha would soon fall, rebelled as well, declaring himself emperor. After some initial defeats at the hands of Northern Wei forces sent against him, he surrendered his post of Pengcheng to Northern Wei's southern rival Liang Dynasty. By this point, Yuan Cha's precautions against Empress Dowager Hu had been greatly relaxed, particularly after Liu Teng's death in 523, as he no longer saw her as a threat. Empress Dowager Hu, Emperor Xiaoming, and Yuan Yong therefore took the chance to conspire against Yuan Cha. Empress Dowager Hu first threw Yuan Cha's guard off by often discussing about his overly trusting of Yuan Faseng, which caused Yuan Cha to be an apologetic mood. Then, with his agreement, she relieved him of his command of the imperial guards, replacing him with Hou Gang, who had become close to him. In summer 525, she took sudden action and declared herself regent again, killing most of Yuan Cha's and Liu's associates and putting Yuan Cha under house arrest. However, she was initially hesitant to take further action against Yuan Cha, because of her relationship with her sister. Eventually, however, with popular opinion favoring Yuan Cha's death, she forced him and his brother Yuan Gua (ÂÖÉÁìú) to commit suicide, but still posthumously awarded him much honor. Second regency Empress Dowager Hu, after resumption of her regency over Emperor Xiaoming, allowed her lover Zheng Yan to assume great power, and while Yuan Yong and Yuan L√ºe (ÂÖÉÁï•) the Prince of Dongping (Yuan Xi's brother) were trusted and had high ranks, Zheng and Zheng's associate Xu Ge (ÂæêÁ¥á) were more powerful than they were. The agrarian and other revolts continued, and during these years, the more chief rebels included: * Xianyu Xiuli (ÈÆÆ‰∫é‰øÆÁ¶Æ), with his rebellion centering Ding Province (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei. After Xianyu's death, his general Ge Rong (ËëõÊ¶Æ) took over and became very strong, proclaiming himself the Emperor of Qi * Xiao Baoyin, son of Emperor Ming of Southern Qi, who sought to reestablish Southern Qi, with his rebellion centering Chang'an * Xing Gao (ÈÇ¢Êù≤), with his rebellion centering Beihai (roughly modern Weifang, Shandong) * Moqi Chounu (‰∏á‰øüÈÜúÂ•¥), with his rebellion centering Gaoping (È´òÂπ≥, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia) Empress Dowager Hu sent a number of generals against these rebels without much success, and while Xiao Baoyin was defeated by his own subordinates and forced to flee to Moqi, no other major rebels were defeated by Northern Wei generals. Exacerbating the situation was the fact that Empress Dowager Hu did not like to hear about news of rebel successes, and therefore her attendants often made up good news, causing her to often refuse generals' requests for reinforcements. Several times, Emperor Xiaoming publicly declared that he would personally lead armies against the rebels, but each time he failed to actually do so. Meanwhile, during these internal troubles that Northern Wei, Liang took advantage by capturing a number of border cities, including the important city Shouyang. The only real military success that Northern Wei had during this time happened in late 525, when it was able to recapture Pengcheng from Liang‚Äîand the success was fortuitous, as the Liang prince Xiao Zong (Ëï≠Á∂ú), the son of Emperor Wu of Liang and his concubine Consort Wu, who was previously the concubine of Southern Qi emperor Xiao Baojuan, became convinced that he was actually Xiao Baojuan's posthumous son, and surrendered to Northern Wei, causing his own army to collapse and allowing Northern Wei to reenter Pengcheng. Sometime during this second regency, Empress Dowager Hu, in order to further enhance her clan's prestige, married a daughter of her cousin Hu Sheng (ËÉ°Áõõ) to Emperor Xiaoming, to be his empress. However, Emperor Xiaoming favored his concubine Consort Pan, and Empress Hu and the other concubines did not receive much favor from him. in 528, Consort Pan bore him a daughter. However, Empress Dowager Hu falsely declared that Consort Pan's child was a son, and ordered a general pardon. By this time, Emperor Xiaoming, aged 18, was tired of the hold that his mother had on his administration, and he further despised Zheng Yan and Xu Ge. He therefore sent secret messengers to the general Erzhu Rong, who controlled the region around Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern central Shanxi), ordering him to advance on Luoyang to force Empress Dowager Hu to remove Zheng and Xu. After Erzhu advanced to Shangdang (‰∏äÈª®, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), Emperor Xiaoming suddenly changed his mind and sent messengers to stop him, but the news leaked. Zheng and Xu therefore advised Empress Dowager Hu to have Emperor Xiaoming poisoned. She did so, and after initially announcing that Emperor Xiaoming's \\"son\\" by Consort Pan would succeed him, admitted that the \\"son\\" was actually a daughter, and instead selected Yuan Zhao the son of Yuan Baohui (ÂÖÉÂØ∂Êöâ) the Prince of Lintao, two-years in age, to succeed Emperor Xiaoming. Death Erzhu Rong refused to recognize Yuan Zhao as emperor. With support from his associate Yuan Tianmu (ÂÖÉÂ§©Á©Ü), he issued a harshly worded statement accusing Zheng and Xu of poisoning Emperor Xiaoming. Empress Dowager Hu sent Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Shilong to try to persuade him to change his mind, but Erzhu Shilong instead encouraged him to continue his resistance. He therefore prepared to advance south, and meanwhile sent messengers to persuade Emperor Xuanwu's well-regarded cousin Yuan Ziyou the Prince of Changle to accept the throne as a competing claimant to the throne. Yuan Ziyou agreed, and as Erzhu Rong approached Luoyang, Yuan Ziyou and his brothers Yuan Shao (ÂÖÉÂä≠) the Prince of Pengcheng and Yuan Zizheng (ÂÖÉÂ≠êÊ≠£) the Duke of Bacheng secretly left Luoyang to join Erzhu's army. Erzhu declared him emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhuang). As soon as news of Emperor Xiaozhuang's ascension reached Luoyang, Luoyang's defenses collapsed, and Zheng and Xu, abandoning Empress Dowager Hu, fled, while the generals Zheng Xianhu (ÈÑ≠ÂÖàË≠∑, Zheng Yan's cousin) and Fei Mu (Ë≤ªÁ©Ü) surrendered to Erzhu Rong. Upon hearing the bad news, Empress Dowager Hu ordered all of Emperor Xiaoming's consorts to become nuns. She herself took tonsure as well, but did not declare herself a nun. Erzhu ordered the imperial officials to welcome Emperor Xiaozhuang into the capital, and the officials complied. Erzhu then sent cavalry soldiers to arrest Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao and deliver them to his camp at Heyin (Ê≤≥Èô∞, near Luoyang). Once Empress Dowager Hu met Erzhu, she tried to repeatedly explain and defend her actions. Erzhu became impatient of her explanations, and he left abruptly and ordered that Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao be thrown into the Yellow River to drown.„ÄäÈ≠èÊõ∏¬∑Âç∑13„ÄãÔºöËç£ÈÅ£È™ëÊãòÈÄÅÂ§™ÂêéÂèäÂπº‰∏ª‰∫éÊ≤≥Èò¥„ÄÇÂ§™ÂêéÂØπËç£Â§öÊâÄÈôàËØ¥ÔºåËç£ÊãÇË°£ËÄåËµ∑„ÄÇÂ§™ÂêéÂèäÂπº‰∏ªÂπ∂Ê≤â‰∫éÊ≤≥„ÄÇ Shortly after Empress Dowager Hu's death by drowning, her body was recovered.

The battle marked the defeat of the Republic of Siena in its war against the Duchy of Florence, and resulted in Siena losing its independence and being absorbed into the Duchy of Florence.  Prelude  In 1554, Cosimo I de' Medici, with the support of Emperor Charles V, launched a grand campaign to conquer Florence's last remaining rival in Tuscany, the Republic of Siena. His army was under the command of Gian Giacomo Medici, Marquess of Marignano,Only a homonymous of the ruling dynasty of Florence. best known as \\"Medeghino\\" (\\"Small Medici\\"). The Florentine-Imperial troops were divided into three corps: Federico Barbolani di Montauto, with 800 men, landed in southern Tuscany to conquer the area of Grosseto; Rodolfo Baglioni, with 3,000 men, invaded the Val di Chiana to conquer Chiusi, Pienza, and Montalcino; and the main corps under Medeghino himself, consisting of 4,500 infantry, 20 cannons, and 1,200 sappers, was deployed at Poggibonsi for the main attack against Siena. The Sienese entrusted the defence to Piero Strozzi, a fierce rival of the Medici family and a general in French service. French troops, as well as some Florentine exiled by the Medici, took part in the war under the Sienese aegis. The Florentine troops approached Siena on the night of January 26, 1554. After an initial failed assault, the Marquess of Marignano laid siege to the city, although his men were not numerous enough to totally cut it off from the countryside. Both Baglioni and Montauto failed to capture Pienza and Grosseto. French ships harassed the Florentine resupply lines at Piombino. Cosimo replied to the initial setbacks by hiring Ascanio della Cornia with 6,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, and waiting for further Imperial reinforcements. On June 11, Strozzi attempted a sally to relieve the pressure on Siena, leaving some French units in the city. He moved towards Pontedera, forcing Medeghino to raise the siege to follow him. This did not prevent Strozzi from joining with a French contingent with 3,500 infantry, 700 horse, and 4 cannons in the territory of Lucca. On June 21, Strozzi conquered Montecatini, but did not feel confident enough to join in a pitched battle against Medeghino, waiting instead for further French reinforcements which were to arrive at Viareggio. He had, in total, 9,500 infantry and perhaps 1,200 cavalry, while Medici had 2,000 Spanish, 3,000 German, and 6,000 Italian infantry, as well as 600 cavalry, not to mention further troops from Spain and Corsica which had recently landed at Bocca d'Arno. His brother, Leone Strozzi, had been killed by an arquebus ball in the course of the struggle for Grosseto. Strozzi therefore marched back to Siena, where the supply situation had become desperate. In July, he failed to capture Piombino, in southern Tuscany, the only port from which the French supplies could reach Siena. On July 17, conscious that only a victory in a pitched battle could save the city, he tried a third sally in the Val di Chiana, in the direction of Arezzo, leaving 1,000 infantry and 200 cavalry as a garrison under Blaise de Montluc. His field army included 14,000 infantry, about 1,000 cavalry, and five guns. His force easily overwhelmed the small Florentine garrisons on his way, although the attempt, on July 20, to conquer Arezzo failed. He managed to capture Lucignano, Marciano della Chiana, Foiano, and other centres in the following days. After some days of inactivity, Medeghino raised the siege of Siena and moved to meet Strozzi. Battle The Battle of Marciano in an ancient print. After some initial skirmishes, the two large armies clashed when Strozzi, short of food, decided to retire towards Lucignano in the night of August 1. In the morning of the following day, it was clear that his manoeuver had not been successful, and he was forced to lay battle against the Florentine- Imperial troops that were stalking and harassing his moving troops. The Sienese had: c. 1,000 French-Sienese horse on the right wing; then followed, in the centre, 3,000 Landsknechts, with 3,000 Grisons infantry behind them and another 3,000 French infantry on their left; the left wing was formed by 5,000 Italian infantry under Paolo Orsini. Strozzi's army occupied the slight slope of a hill that descended towards the Scannagallo creek. Il Medeghino deployed 1,200 light cavalry on his left wing, backed by 300 Uomini-d'Arme (heavy cavalry) under Marcantonio Colonna. The centre infantry corps was composed by 2,000 Spanish veterans and other Corsican recruits and 4,000 German Landsknechts under Niccol√≤ Madruzzo. The right wing was formed by 4,000 Tuscan, 2,000 Spanish and 3,000 poorly trained Roman infantry, in three rows, with the few artillery pieces available behind. The reserve included 200 Spanish soldiers, veterans of the Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars, and a company of horse arquebusiers from Naples. The battle began with the attack of the Medeghino's cavalry wing, whose impetus easily routed its French-Sienese counterpart, which fled towards Foiano. It has been reported that the French commanders of that unit, Valleron and Fourquevaux, had been bribed by the Medeghino with 12 tin flasks filled with golden coins.Rendina, Capitani di ventura, p. 180 To counter this first setback, Strozzi decided to launch down from the hill with the German infantry in his center. A chaotic melee ensued but soon the momentum of the Sienese attack began to wane under the fire of the Imperial artillery which also disorganized the Swiss attempting to relieve the first line. When Il Medeghino then ordered his men to launch themselves against the enemy the German and Swiss began to panic. This turned into a route when Colonna's heavy cavalry, who had pursued for a while the French- Sienese cavalry, attacked the Germans, fighting across the Scannagallo, from behind. The French infantry on the right wing maintained its battle order and, surrounded on every side, defended desperately until the end. Strozzi himself was wounded three times and was carried away by his guards. His lieutenant Clemente della Cervara died shortly after the battle from wounds received. The battle lasted for only two hours, from 11 a.m to 1 p.m. The Sienese army suffered 4,000 dead and 4,000 wounded or prisoners. Strozzi escaped capture. Aftermath Il Medeghino easily subdued the neighbouring castles in the days following the battle, and was subsequently able to lay a tighter siege to Siena. Cruel measures were adopted to prevent the peasants taking supplies into the city. In March 1555 he destroyed a corps of 1,300 mercenaries trying to escape to collect food. Unable to receive substantial supplies and reinforcements from the French, the city surrendered on April 17, 1555 while the remaining Sienese forces withdrew to Montalcino. The Republic of Siena finally disappeared in 1559 and was thenceforth incorporated into the Duchy of Florence. The Duke ordered that a large fortress be constructed as a precaution against the risk of further rebellion by the Sienese, and this has presided over the city, from its north (Florentine) side, since its completion in 1563.

Corps Austria is \\"pflichtschlagend\\", which refers to the fact that it requires of its members to participate in several organized duel-like fencing engagements with members of other specific student fraternities, a ritual dating back to the 17th century and described by Mark Twain in his book \\"A tramp abroad\\". The Corps Austria is further considered \\"farbentragend\\" in that its members wear a colored sash (right shoulder to left waist) across their chests as evidence of their membership of the fraternity. Both of these tendencies are characteristic of the most traditional and often very elite all-male fraternities in countries for central Europe. Eligible applicants are students of the Goethe University Frankfurt and other colleges in Frankfurt, Germany. Members of Corps Austria are colloquially referred to as \\"Austrianer\\", or simply \\"Austern\\". Corps Austria was founded in 1861 at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague and moved to the newly established Goethe University Frankfurt in 1919. The German student corps were traditionally recruited from the nobility and social elite, and are traditionally viewed as more elitist than other German student fraternities such as the Catholic Cartellverband and the Burschenschaften. They consider tolerance and individuality to be key tenets and are rooted in German idealism. Their general political outlook is conservative, but more cosmopolitan and less right-wing than the Burschenschaften. Couleur Couleur The \\"colours\\" of Corps Austria are black, white and yellow, in that exact order. Black and yellow were the colours of the flag of the Habsburg Monarchy until 1867. In addition to the aforementioned coloured sash, headgear is also worn and is deemed an obligatory part of the \\"Couleur\\" or \\"uniform\\" of Corps members. Depending on the time of year, one of two styles of headgear may be chosen by \\"Aktive\\" or active members. In the winter academic semester, a black cap, sporting thin bands of black, white and yellow must be worn. In the summer semester, a white silk \\"St√ºrmer\\" or Kepi with black, white and yellow piping may be worn. According to the constitution of Corps Austria, the \\"St√ºrmer\\" may only be worn if a meeting of the internal council or \\"Corps Convent\\", elects to wear the \\"St√ºrmer\\" for that summer semester. Furthermore, a \\"Kneipjacke\\" or mess jacket may be worn on specific occasions. This jacket is black in colour and features silver and black braiding. \\"F√ºchse\\", initiate applicants to the Corps are allowed to wear a two-coloured sash of black and yellow. This is in contrast to the three-coloured sash of fully-fledged members or corps brothers (CB's). Lastly, as with all such student fraternities, Corps Austria employs its own Motto, \\"Durch Eintracht Stark!\\" or \\"Strength Through Unity!\\" History Fraternity house 150th Founders‚Äôs Day Celebration Ball 2011 Out of fear of the liberal and enlightened ideals of the French Revolution, the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire in Regensburg in 1793 proscribed all student associations. However this ban would be strictly enforced only in the territory of the Habsburg Empire and then in large part thanks to the zeal of the suppressive Metternich r√©gime. Even correspondence with foreign universities would be forbidden to students. After a brief period of respite in the aftermath of the so-called \\"March Revolution\\" of 1848, student associations were once more forbidden in 1849. It was not until 1859, that the situation had sufficiently mellowed to allow the establishment of such student bodies of the same model as were to be found in other German-speaking states. The cause of this change can be attributed both to the overwhelming defeat of the Habsburg Empire in the Battle of Solferino and the resultant dire state of the Empire's finances. In order to carry out much needed reforms to address these issues, Emperor Franz Joseph I required the support of the middle- classes, who tended to embrace liberal ideals. Whilst the question of national identity did not arise concerning students in other German-speaking territories, the question of students' national identity did however arise in the context of the multi-national Habsburg Empire. The Czechs, for example, regarded the particular form of German student association as was introduced to Prague to be \\"typically German\\", whilst the Austrians increasingly believed their student associations to be almost an extension of their national identity. Consequently, such student bodies with their colourful nationalist paraphernalia frequently drew the wrath of the native population upon themselves. Origins of Corps Austria Corps Austria was founded on 23 February 1861 by students of the Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague. On 28 June 1881, an event occurred that would lead to the eventual displacement of the Corps from its birthplace. In the so-called \\"Battle of Kuchelbad\\", a popular destination on the outskirts of Prague, Czech students violently overwhelmed and routed the participants of the annual celebrations (Ger. \\"Stiftungsfest\\") commemorating the founding of the Corps. With this fracas, an unfortunate precedent had been set. Although it was never officially recognised as such, the Battle of Kuchelbad had in fact opened the door on an animosity between the various nationalities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Badeni Language Act of 5 April 1897 attempted to lessen the growing divide between the native Czechs and their German-speaking overlords by giving equal importance to the German and Czech languages in the context of rulings in courts of law in Bohemia and Moravia. A storm of protests by German-speakers engulfed cities across the Empire such that the act was entirely repealed by 1899. A chain of events that would lead to the collapse of the Empire in the First World War had now gained an unstoppable momentum. After World War I, a reconstitution of the Corps in Prague was deemed inadvisable not least because the colours of the Corps reflected the colours of the old Habsburg Monarchy. Instead the Corps quit Prague indefinitely and moved home, once in 1919 to Innsbruck in Austria, as guests of Corps Rhaetia Innsbruck and then in the same year to the newly founded Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, where it has been ever since. In 1935, the National Socialist government passed a law requiring all student bodies to expel members, whom it deemed to be \\"non-aryan\\". Corps Austria refused to comply and accordingly was forced to close its doors in 1936. In 1939, the Corp's association of Old Boys (Alte Herren Verein) was forcibly disbanded by the Gestapo largely because it refused to co-operate with the association of the National Socialist German Students' League (NS-Studentenbund). After World War II, in which 19 members of the Corps lost their lives, Corps Austria was reconstituted in Frankfurt in 1949.  General  Corp Austria has been a member of the K√∂sener Senioren- Convents-Verband (KSCV) since 1919. On the basis of its principles and values (e.g. personal etiquette and decorum), Corps Austria is deemed to belong to the \\"Blue Circle\\", an unofficial circle within the KSCV K√∂sener Senioren- Convents-Verband of Corps with similar values, on which basis alliances and friendships are formed ‚ÄûBlauer Kreis‚Äú.

Licht (March 3, 1916May 30, 1987) was an American politician and the 67th Governor of Rhode Island from 1969 to 1973, serving as the first Jewish governor in Rhode Island state history. He was also an associate justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court from 1956 to 1968 and member of the Rhode Island Senate from 1949 to 1956. Early life and career Licht was born on March 3, 1916Rhode Island Superior Court CentennialState of Rhode Island Manual in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the son of Rose (Kassed) and Jacob Licht. His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants.https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XM87-DSX He graduated from Brown University in 1938 and Harvard Law School in 1941, where he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at both universities. In 1946, he married Dorothy Shirley Krauss; they had three daughters, and eight grandchildren. In 1942 Licht was admitted to the Rhode Island bar, where he served as a law clerk for Judge John C. Mahoney of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. He was a partner with the Providence firm of Letts & Quinn from 1943 to 1956 and was an active member of the Freemasons.http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/RI/masons.html Licht was elected to the Rhode Island Senate in 1949 and served there until 1956. He sat on the Superior Court of Rhode Island from 1956 to 1968. During his time on the Superior Court, Licht was founding member of the Providence Human Rights Commission, was the Chairman of the Chapin Hospital Commission, and was a general lecturer at Bryant College in Smithfield, Rhode Island, where he was a member of Delta Sigma Rho, a national debating fraternity. Governor of Rhode Island In 1968 Licht announced his intention to run for the Democratic nominee for Governor of Rhode Island. During the campaign Licht was seen as the underdog candidate against three term incumbent, later Secretary of the Navy, and U.S. Senator, John Chafee. On November 5, 1968, Licht beat Chafee in a close election, winning with only 51% of the vote. He served as the first Jewish governor of the state of Rhode Island from 1969 to 1973. As governor, he reversed campaign promises he made in 1968 and 1970, pushing through Rhode Island's first income tax in order to resolve a worsening fiscal crisis. He signed the tax bill minutes after the Senate had passed it on a 26‚Äì24 vote, against the backdrop of some 500 angry demonstrators in the State House. During his term as governor, Licht approved more business projects than any other governor in Rhode Island's history, and helped create the Rhode Island Department of Social Rehabilitation Services, and the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals. Licht took a strong stand on environmental protection, playing a big role in revitalizing the New England Water Pollution Control Commission. He created an eleven-member Governor's Council on Environmental Quality, expanding regulatory authority against air and water pollution, and providing tax credits to businesses that included pollution-control systems into their operations. In 1973 Governor Licht did not run for reelection due his unpopularity for implementing a temporary statewide sales tax. Later life and death Frank Licht Judicial Complex, in Providence Rhode Island After leaving office as governor, Licht returned to practicing law in Rhode Island. The Providence County Courthouse in College Hill, Providence, where the Rhode Island Superior Court, the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and the Rhode Island Law Library are located, and where Licht served as a Justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court, was named the Frank Licht Judicial Complex in 1986, in honor of the former governor, and justice of the court. Frank Licht was the uncle of Richard A. Licht, who was Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island from 1985 to 1989 and unsuccessfully challenged John Chafee for the U.S. Senate seat he held in 1988.

It occurs in a few other Mimosa spp. and all members of the closely related genus Leucaena. This compound, also known as leucenol, was first isolated from the seeds of Leucaena glauca Benth., and was later investigated by Adams and coworkers. Properties Mimosine melts with decomposition. The hydrochloride salt melts at 174.5‚Äì175.0 ¬∞C with decomposition; the hydrobromide decomposes at 179.5 ¬∞C, and the hydroiodide decomposes at 183.0‚Äì183.5 ¬∞C. Mimosine only forms monobasic acids, but the methyl ester forms a dihydrochloride, C7H9O2N2(COOMe)‚Ä¢2 HCl‚Ä¢¬Ω H2O, mp. 175‚Äì6 ¬∞C. Biological effects Mimosine arrests dividing cells in the late G1 phase by inhibiting DNA replication initiation.T. Krude Exp. Cell Res. Volume 247, Issue 1, 1999, Pages 148-159 In ruminants, mimosine is degraded to 3,4- and 2,3-dihydroxypyridone (3,4- and 2,3-DHP). Although toxicosis has occurred in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Africa and Florida, it has not been recorded in any other tropical and subtropical regions. Goats in Burma lost hair when fed a diet containing 50% of Leucaena. Goats and cattle in Hawaii are able to degrade the 3,4-DHP ruminally. Tolerance might be related to the presence or absence of microbes tolerant to mimosine and 3,4-DHP. It is known that at least Australian goats do not share the abilities of their Hawaiian counterparts. Bickel and WibautRec. Trav. Chim., 1946, 65 65; Wibaut, Helv. Chim. Acta, 1946, 29 1669; (with Kleipol), Rec. Trav. Chim., 1947, 66 24, 459. found in feeding experiments with rats and mice that leucenol is probably the toxic constituent of Leucaena glauca seeds, but they did not observe with these animals the loss of hair that seems to occur when these seeds are fed to cattle. Aung from Myanmar isolated the new subspecies of Klebsiella pneumoniae that can degrade mimosine.http://tropicalgrasslands.info/index.php/tgft/article/viewFile/38/11 Some rhizobia are known to produce rhizomimosinase, which consumes pyridoxal 5‚Ä≤-phosphate to degrade mimosine into 3,4 dihydroxypyridine, pyruvate, and ammonium.

Penalties vary from one sport to the next.

In indoor soccer, if a team is found to have more than six players on the field, the extra player is given a blue card and is sent to the penalty box for two minutes. Australian rules football In Australian rules football, the primary means for controlling interchanges in most leagues is the head count. At the request of a team captain, the umpire will instruct all players from both teams line to line-up in the centre of the ground, and the umpire will then count the players. If either team is found to have more than eighteen players on the field, the team's entire score to that point of the game is cancelled, except if that team's score was zero points at the time of the head count. Since 2008, in the top level Australian Football League, the interchange steward monitors player interchanges, and informs the emergency umpire directly if a team has more than eighteen men on the ground due to an interchange error. When an infringement is identified in this manner, a free kick and 50-metre penalty are awarded to the opposing team at the centre of the ground, but the team's score is not cancelled because infringements are usually noticed quickly, minimizing the potential influence on the game. Baseball Baseball limits teams to nine players (one pitcher, one catcher, and seven other fielders) on the defense at any time. If the defense is found to have more than nine players on the field, the umpire must determine which is the additional player(s), and the player(s) so determined shall be ejected. Basketball Professional and collegiate basketball (both men's and women's) limit teams to five players on the court at any one time. A team with more than five in play at once is assessed a technical foul for Too Many Players on the Court. In March 2009, the National Basketball Association rules were changed to allow for the nullification of goals scored with too many players on the court. Under no circumstance can any player or coach be ejected on a technical foul caused by too many players. Recent NBA Rules Change in Regards to ‚ÄúToo Many Players on the Court‚Äù Gridiron football In gridiron football, if a team has more than the allowed number of players on the field during a play (eleven in NFL, twelve in CFL), the offending team is penalized five (American) or ten (Canadian) yards for too many men on the field (also called twelve/thirteen men on the field). This is usually the result of an improper substitution. The 2009 Grey Cup game in the CFL was decided on a too-many-men call. A related, but more serious, penalty of illegal participation occurs if the extra man or men enter the field during the play. Illegal participation is a 15-yard penalty in high school football. If the illegal participant prevents a score, it is an unfair act and the score is awarded. Ice hockey Too many men on the ice is a bench penalty in ice hockey called when a team has more than the legal number of players (six, including the goalie, if not already short handed) on the ice at one time. This term is normally used even in women's ice hockey, although occasionally the word men may be replaced by players. The penalty for the infraction is two minutes in the penalty box served by the player chosen by the offending coach from one of his players on the ice at the time of the infraction. This penalty is most commonly seen during a \\"line change\\", when teams are switching players off and replacements are coming on. If either the player entering, or the player exiting, plays the puck while the other is on the ice, the penalty is called. If the incoming or outgoing player is accidentally struck by the puck, it is not an infraction. In the NHL, substitution is allowed when the outgoing player is within of their bench. Lacrosse Similar to hockey, too many men is a minor penalty in lacrosse, and a player from the offending team is sent to the penalty box.

The battle resulted in a decisive Portuguese victory and is considered as one of the most important battles in the country's history.  Prelude  Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva, commander of the Portuguese army during the battle By 1665, the Portuguese Restoration War had been raging for 25 years. Despite numerous setbacks, King Philip IV of Spain was determined to crush the Portuguese insurrection. After a disastrous campaign in Southern Portugal culminated in the 1662 Battle of Ameixial, the Spanish court re-evaluated the performance of the Spanish Army and came to the conclusion that the war could only be ended by decisive action. The court believed that the Portuguese insurrection could only be ended by the capture of a major Portuguese city or by the complete destruction of the Portuguese Army. Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena, a veteran of campaigns in Italy and the Netherlands, was appointed to lead the new invasion of Portugal. Carrillo had served as a field commander and as a military governor, and his organizational skills were lauded. Carrillo planned to end the war by capturing the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. To reach the city, he planned first to take Vila Vi√ßosa, followed by Set√∫bal. Once he was in command, Carrillo wanted to gather his army's strength to ensue that he outnumbered whatever Portuguese army chose to engage him. However, the worsening illness of King Philip caused the court to order him to proceed with the invasion, as they feared that the death of Philip would strengthen foreign support for the Portuguese. The Spanish crown was also facing financial difficulties, and there was a legitimate fear that the army would have to be disbanded for lack of funds if the war continued. The Portuguese were prepared and had foreseen such an attack. 3,500 men were moved from Tr√°s-os-Montes in the north to Alentejo in the south. A further 7,800 men came from Lisbon, under command of Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, who had defeated the Spanish in the Battle of the Lines of Elvas six years earlier. They were reinforced by a veteran English contingent of 2,000 men under the command of the Duke of Schomberg. A veteran commander who had been defending the Portuguese border with Spain for over 20 years, Meneses was aware that there were any number of ways for Carrillo to invade the country. As such, he reinforced the border garrisons of Elvas and Campo Maior, hoping to harden the frontier defenses and in doing so influence the route Carrillo would take. Having been present during the Portuguese victory at Ameixial, Meneses was well aware that the Spanish faced logistical challenges when invading Portugal, and as such he planned to keep Carrillo's army trapped in the border hinterlands as long as possible to wear down their numbers. The Portuguese were also conscious of the failing health of the Spanish king, and Meneses suspected that this would force them to attack.Tuell, 242 Carrillo's army moved into Portugal on 25 May. He first took Borba without resistance after it was abandoned by the Portuguese garrison. He then laid siege to Vila Vi√ßosa, which was better defended and offered a stiff resistance to the Spanish attackers. The Portuguese decided to exchange land for time, as it was hoped that the rough terrain of the hinterlands would degrade Carrillo's army. Despite this strategy, Meneses was determined to engage the Spanish army on a battlefield of his choosing. The main body of the Portuguese army set itself in motion towards the Spanish force surrounding Vila Vi√ßosa, but it stopped in Montes Claros, halfway between Vila Vi√ßosa and Estremoz.White, L. (2007). Strategic Geography and the Spanish Habsburg Monarchy's Failure to Recover Portugal, 1640-1668. The Journal of Military History, 71(2), 373-409. Carrillo, who was at that time furthering the siege of Vila Vicosa, was fast losing men to attrition. By June, attacks by Portuguese militias were taking a heavy toll on his lines of supply, Vila Vicosa continued to put up an unexpectedly fierce defense, and the Spanish court was demanding action. In spite of these setbacks, Carrillo continued to rely on his previous plans for the capture of Lisbon. However, when informed that Meneses's numerically inferior force was advancing on him from Estremoz, Carrillo decided to engage the Portuguese. Battle Meneses deployed his army in a defensive formation adjacent to and at the southern end of a long ridge. A dense forest and hills lay further to the south of the Portuguese positions. By defending the space between these two terrain features, Meneses planned to limit the number of Portuguese and Spanish soldiers fighting at any one time and as such counter the superior Spanish numbers. He positioned his heaviest infantry, composed of seasoned veterans, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries under the command of Frederic Schomberg in two lines in this gap and positioned his artillery to support them. The rest of the Portuguese army was held in reserve and ordered to prevent the Spanish from scaling the ridge line. Carrillo was well aware of the Portuguese defenses and massed his cavalry and artillery for an all out attack on the gap between the ridge and the forest.Tuell, 243-44 Contemporary engraving of the battle The battle opened with the Spanish artillery firing into the Portuguese positions, opening gaps in the first line of infantry. The Spanish cavalry then charged the Portuguese lines and overran several units. The Portuguese infantry organized themselves into squares to fend off the cavalry, but this left them vulnerable to the Spanish artillery. The Duke of Schomberg's men gathered around some buildings on the left flank of the Portuguese army, using the structures and a vineyard wall to break up the advancing mass of Spanish cavalry. The Portuguese cannon fired repeatedly into the ranks of Spanish cavalry, inflicting many casualties. As the first Spanish charge retreated, Meneses ordered his first line back and consolidated it into the second line. When a Spanish cannonball killed Sir Francisco da Silva Moura, the commander of the Portuguese contingent of the second line, Meneses took command in person.McMurdo. A second Spanish cavalry attack and barrage again caused many casualties in the Portuguese infantry lines, but was forced to withdraw due to the Portuguese artillery. Carrillo then ordered a massive third charge, incorporating both cavalry and infantry, into the Portuguese defenses. The battle raged on and the fighting was extremely intense. The Duke of Schomberg had his horse shot from underneath him and was almost captured by the Spanish. The Portuguese artillery in particular was devastating as shot after shot was fired into the advancing mass of Spaniards, while the Spanish cannon were soon forced to cease in their firing for fear of hitting their own men. The assault collapsed, and Spanish infantry and cavalrymen were soon pressed tightly together, becoming easy targets for the Portuguese. The Spanish cavalry alone suffered over 1,200 casualties in the third charge against the Portuguese line. The Portuguese forces remained mostly intact, while the already diminished Spanish army - who had placed all their hopes on the cavalry charges - started to lose hope. Having failed to breach Meneses's defenses, Carrillo began to slowly withdraw to the north. Then, After 7 hours of ferocious fighting, the Portuguese launched a counterattack. The Portuguese cavalry led by D. Luis Melo e Castro, which had until this point played a limited role in the battle, charged and overcame the weakened left flank of the Spanish army. The Spanish army started to fall apart and fled in disorder towards Juromenha, leaving behind all their artillery and many dead and wounded. Thousands of Spanish soldiers were captured and made prisoners, with eight Spanish generals being among the captured. Almost all of the 1,500 Spanish fugitives who had taken refuge in the many woods around Vila Vi√ßosas for fear of being killed if they surrendered eventually died as a result of their wounds and hunger in the weeks following the battle.Contemporary author- Relacion verdadera, y pontual, de la gloriosissima victoria ... de Montes Claros, Oficina Henrique Valente de Oliveira, 1665, pp. 46,47. A great many arms and armaments were captured by the Portuguese. The total Spanish casualties in this campaign to conquer Portugal amounted to 4,000 killed in the battlefield, 1,200 to 1,500 killed during the siege of Vila Vi√ßosa (before the battle), almost 1,500 fugitives who died in the immediate weeks after the battle and eventually 6,000 prisoners and 4,000 wounded. The Portuguese suffered some 700 killed and more than 2,000 wounded. Aftermath The Battle of Montes Claros effectively ended major combat operations during the Restoration War and definitively secured Portuguese independence from Spain. The Spanish did not attempt another invasion; instead the defeat led to a treaty being signed between England and Spain at Madrid in 1667. As a result of this England mediated the Treaty of Lisbon which was signed by Portugal and Spain a year later. Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the House of Braganza was recognized.

The painting was completed in early May at a time when he was convalescing from a severe relapse in his health some two months before his death, which is generally accepted as a suicide. In the 1970 catalogue raisonn√©, it is given the title Worn Out: At Eternity's Gate. Lithograph The lithograph was based on a pencil drawing Worn Out, one of a series of studies he made in 1882 of a pensioner and war veteran, Adrianus Jacobus Zuyderland, at a local almshouse in The Hague and itself a reworking of a drawing and watercolor he had made the previous year. The inspiration for Worn Out was Hubert von Herkomer's Sunday at the Chelsea Hospital, an immensely popular print depicting an old war veteran slumped dead that went on to become an acclaimed painting at the Royal Academy, The Last Muster, that Van Gogh had seen in 1875 when in England. Van Gogh wrote of his drawing: Van Gogh's first attempt at the lithograph followed just two days later. He wrote: Later, in a rare expression of his own religious feelings, he wrote expressly about this lithograph and two other drawings also posed by Zuyderland, of an old man reading a Bible and saying grace (below) respectively:Hulsker (1980) p. 69.Erickson (1998) p. 77. Writing about At Eternity's Gate in 1998, the American theologian Kathleen Powers Erickson remarked: Seven impressions of the lithograph are known, of which one is annotated At Eternity's Gate. The same theme is taken up again in two later 1883 studies of a seated woman. Genesis Portrait of Doctor F√©lix Rey (F500, JH1659), oil on canvas 1889, Pushkin Museum. Rey disliked his portrait and gave it away. Vincent van Gogh suffered from some form of mental illness, acutely during the last two years of his life. The official diagnosis furnished by the hospital in Arles that Van Gogh was taken to on Christmas Eve, 1888, following the celebrated incident involving his ear, was \\"acute mania with generalised delirium\\". Dr. F√©lix Rey, a young intern at the hospital, also suggested \\"a kind of epilepsy\\" he characterised as mental epilepsy.Naifeh and Smith (2011), 701 ff., 729, 749 There is no agreement today over a modern diagnosis of Van Gogh's illness. Suggestions include epilepsy and bipolar disorder, possibly exacerbated by excessive absinthe drinking, heavy smoking and venereal disease. Symptoms were varied, but in their most severe manifestations they involved attacks of confusion and unconsciousness followed by periods of stupor and incoherence during which he was generally unable to paint, draw, or even to write letters.Hulsker (1980), 390Naifeh and Smith (2011), 707 ff., 814 - 816 It was such an attack that first led him to being hospitalised at Arles, and following a later relapse, he had himself committed to the asylum at Saint- R√©my in May 1889, where he remained for the most part until May 1890. On February 22, 1890, Van Gogh suffered his most severe relapse, an episode Jan Hulsker called the longest and saddest of his life, and one which lasted some nine weeks through to late April.Hulsker (1980), 404 During this time, he was only able to write his brother Theo once, in March 1890, and then only briefly to say he was totally stupefied (totalement abruti) and unable to write. He did not write Theo again until late April, but that letter makes it clear that he had been able to paint and draw a little during this time, despite his sadness and melancholy:Pomerans (2003), 483 It is in these drawings and paintings that Hulsker sees unmistakable signs of his mental collapse, otherwise rare in his work.Hulsker (1980), 442 It is not clear whether Sorrowing Old Man ('At Eternity's Gate') is one of the canvases referred to in his April letter. Hulsker remarks that it would have been remarkable for Van Gogh to have copied his lithograph so faithfully from memory. Nevertheless, the painting is clearly a return to the past, and both the 1970 catalogue raisonn√© and Hulsker cite the painting as fecit May 1890 at Saint-R√©my.

It is found mainly in dense shaded forests where it hunts in small streams. It is darker crowned, with darker rufous underparts and lacking the rufous ear stripe of the common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) which is found in more open habitats. A number of subspecies have been described that differ in measurement and colour shade. Adult males have an all dark bill while females have a reddish lower mandible. Taxonomy The blue-eared kingfisher was described by the American naturalist Thomas Horsfield in 1821 and given its current binomial name Alcedo meninting. The name Alcedo is the Latin word for a \\"kingfisher\\". The specific epithet meninting is the Javanese word for the species. The blue-eared kingfisher is one of seven species in the genus Alcedo and is most closely related to Blyth's kingfisher (Alcedo hercules). Several plumage variations in the population that occur across its wide distribution range have been recognized as subspecies: *A. m. coltarti Baker ECS, 1919 ‚Äì Nepal, northeast India, northern Thailand and Indochina *A. m. phillipsi Baker ECS, 1927 ‚Äì southwest India and Sri Lanka *A. m. scintillans Baker ECS, 1919 ‚Äì southern Myanmar and Thailand *A. m. rufigastra Walden, 1873 ‚Äì Andaman Islands *A. m. meninting Horsfield, 1821 ‚Äì southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, southern Philippines, Islands off the west coast of Sumatra, Java, Lombok, Sulawesi, Banggai and Sula Islands. Some other subspecies such as verreauxii, callima, subviridis and proxima are not considered to be sufficiently distinct. Blue- eared kingfisher (Male) from Guwahati, Assam Description Shaded forest streams are the usual habitat. A. m. phillipsi This long kingfisher is almost identical to the common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) but is distinguished by the blue ear coverts, darker and more intense cobalt-blue upperparts with richer rufous under parts. The juvenile blue-eared kingfisher has rufous ear-coverts as in the common kingfisher but it usually shows some mottling on the throat and upper breast which disappears when the bird reaches adulthood. Young birds have a reddish bill with whitish tips. Distribution and habitat The range of this species stretches from India in the west, eastwards across Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and further into Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia. The usual habitat is pools or streams in dense evergreen forest and sometimes mangroves, situated under of altitude. Behaviour and ecology The blue-eared kingfisher is largely resident within its range. They usually perch on branches overhanging densely shaded streams before diving below to capture prey that includes crustaceans, dragonfly larvae and fish. Other insects including grasshoppers and mantids have been recorded. The breeding season in India is mainly May to June in northern India and January in southwestern India. The nest is a metre long tunnel in the bank of a forest stream where about five to seven white near spherical eggs are laid.

She received a number of awards for the film, including a special mention at the Cannes Film Festival. Samoilova had several major roles in the 1960s before largely disappearing from public life. In 1993, she was named a People's Artist of Russia. She made a comeback in the 2000s and received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2007 Moscow Film Festival. Early life The only daughter of actor Yevgeny Samoilov (or Samojlov), Samoilova was born in Leningrad on 4 May 1934. Her mother, Zinaida (n√©e Levina), was Jewish. Soon after her birth, Samoilova's father moved the family to Moscow. As a young girl, Samoilova was interested in ballet and studied music with her mother. She attended the prestigious Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theatre to study ballet, graduating in 1953. She was offered a position with the Bolshoi Theatre by Maya Plisetskaya, but chose to attend the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute to study acting instead. While still in school, she appeared in one film ‚Äì The Mexican by director Vladimir Kaplunovskiy. Film career After three years at the Boris Shchukin Theater, Samoilova landed the lead role of Veronika in Mikhail Kalatozov's war film The Cranes Are Flying in 1957. The film was a tremendous success, becoming the only Soviet movie to win the Palme d'Or, at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. Samoilova received a special mention for \\"Most Modest and Charming Actress\\". She went on to win Best Foreign Actress at the Jussi Awards and the German Film Critics Award for Best Actress in 1958. In 1959, she was nominated for Best Foreign Actress at the BAFTA Awards. While on tour promoting The Cranes Are Flying, Samoilova met Pablo Picasso who boldly predicted \\"tomorrow you will be driving in a car through Hollywood\\". The prediction nearly came true, as she received offers to work in Hollywood and other foreign film industries. However, upon return home she learned the Soviet government would forbid her taking foreign roles because she was still a student at the time. Instead, Samoilova followed up her role in The Cranes Are Flying with the lead role in Cranes director Mikhail Kalatazov's next film, 1959's Letter Never Sent. In 1960, she lost her job at the Mayakovsky Theatre and was unemployed for several years. In 1964, Samoilova starred in Giuseppe De Santis' war drama Attack and Retreat. Samoilova had the title role in Aleksandr Zarkhi's Anna Karenina, appearing beside her former husband Vasily Lanovoy in the 1967 film. Legacy After several roles during the 1970s, Samoilova largely avoided the public light. Even so, she remained one of Russia's most popular actresses. In 1993, Samoilova was named a People's Artist of Russia, one of the state's highest honors. In 2007, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 29th Moscow International Film Festival. Samoilova made a comeback in the 2000s, appearing in a number of television programs. Her final role was in Igor Voloshin's 2008 film Nirvana. In honor of her 80th birthday, Russian state television broadcast a series of programs about Samoilova on 4 May 2014. Personal life and death Samoilova was married four times, most recently to author Sol Shulman. All her marriages ended in divorce. On 3 May 2014, the eve of her 80th birthday, Samoilova was taken to hospital in serious condition with coronary heart disease and hypertension. She died the following day at 23:30, and was buried at Novodevichy cemetery on 7 May. President Vladimir Putin sent his condolences upon Samoilova's death. At her funeral, movie industry insiders spoke of Samoilova's artistic gifts, but also spoke about how she had been cheated of the fortune she should have earned in life by the Soviet government. Singer and Member of Parliament Iosif Kobzon remarked, \\"she didn't have money. It‚Äôs shameful how cultural figures are treated.\\" Samoilova was survived by a brother, her son from her third marriage, and a granddaughter, who was named after her.

It was recorded at drummer Tim Powles' Spacejunk studios in Australia and features many straight-to-tape recordings with few overdubs. Around the time of Parallel Universes (late 2002) release, the Church returned to the studio to record another album, eventually entitled Forget Yourself. Rather than fleshing the songs out over a long, gradual process, the band decided to keep the music as close to the original jam-based material as possible. Stylistically, this made for a much rawer sound, primarily recorded live and with minimal overdubs. As had become routine since Sometime Anywhere (May 1994), songs saw numerous instrument changes between members, with Powles playing guitar on \\"Sealine\\" and Willson-Piper switching to drums on \\"Maya.\\" John D.

The Zoo is nestled in Potawatomi Park between the St. Joseph River and the Grand Trunk railroad in the east side neighborhood of River Park. Founded in 1902, it is Indiana's oldest Zoo. The zoo's mission is to inspire excellence in education, conservation, and improved animal quality of life. It features over 400 animals and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The zoo has over 200,000 visitors each year.  History  Potawatomi Zoo began in 1921 when a single deer was donated by Albert Russell Erskine, then president of the Studebaker Corporation.\\"Minutes of the South Bend Board of Park Commissioners, Book 1, 21 May 1921 At the end of the Great Depression in 1940, the Works Progress Administration constructed the zoo's Cat House, its first permanent structure. The building still stands, serving as home to Amur leopards and is the oldest zoo building still standing.\\"Annual Report, Board of South Bend Park Commissioners\\", 1940 The list of species housed at the zoo in 1947 included a polar bear, African lions, dwarf zebu, rhesus monkeys, peacocks and the less exotic raccoon. In 1971, the St. Joseph Zoological Society, now called Potawatomi Zoological Society, was formed, with Craig D. McCowan as its first director. In 1981, the zoo began charging admission, to provide an accurate attendance count as well as revenue. The zoo was formerly run and maintained by the South Bend Parks and Recreation Department. Since January 1, 2014, it has been run and maintained by the Potawatomi Zoological Society,http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/zoological- society-to-take-over-management-of-potawatomi-zoo/23520296 while still remaining city owned. In 2018, the zoo broke ground on a new front entrance that is scheduled to open in the Spring of 2020. Exhibits The Potawatomi Zoo is home to over 400 animals and the zoo participates in over 56 Species Survival Plans.  Africa  The Africa section spans much of the eastern third of the zoo. Leaving the Zoo Farm the Africa section begins with the Old World Monkeys exhibit which is home to black-and-white Colobus monkeys. In this part of the zoo you will also find Southern ground hornbills, lions, Plains zebra, addax, Diana monkeys, chimpanzees, African wild dogs, Greater kudo, and ostrich. In 2017, it became the first accredited zoo in the state of Indiana to house a pair of okapi, a rare forest-dwelling relative of the common giraffe. In 2019, the zoo announced the addition of a Southern white rhinoceros.  Asia  The Potawatomi Zoo is home to numerous species that are native to parts of Asia but these exhibits are spread throughout the zoo rather than being in one section. Near the front gate on the east side of the zoo is the Amur tiger exhibit and the Sichuan takins. In 2014, a red panda and muntjac exhibit was added near the front gate on the western side.  Australian Trail  In the middle of the zoo is the Australian Trail, which allows you to walk among emus, kangaroos, and Bennett's wallabies. This exhibit also includes a yellow-crested cockatoo, laughing kookaburra, and black swans.  Cat House  The zoo's Cat House was its first permanent structure built during the Great Depression as part of the Works Progress Administration. The Cat House includes outdoor exhibits for a snow leopard and Amur leopards. The birth of rare Amur leopard cubs in the summer of 2016 was a big hit.  Learning Center  The Learning Center is located at the front of the zoo. It is home to many smaller creatures and the Zoo's Education department. Animals on exhibit include two-toed sloth, golden lion tamarin, cotton-top tamarin, white-faced saki, red-rumped agouti, three-banded armadillo, ring-tailed lemur, squirrel monkeys, green iguana, banded mongoose, Madagascar hissing cockroach, Texas brown tarantula, Goliath bird eating tarantula, Chilean tarantula, Emperor scorpion, Malaysian scorpion, vinegaroon, as well as various turtles, snakes, geckos, frogs, skinks and other reptiles and amphibians.

Q. Story Neighborhood Historic District is located in central Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The neighborhood runs from McDowell Road south to Roosevelt Street and from Seventh Avenue west to Grand Avenue. The neighborhood as well as many of the individual houses are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The F.Q. Story neighborhood consists of 602 homes that were constructed from the late 1920s through the late 1940s. A variety of architectural styles, including Spanish Colonial Revival, English Tudor, Craftsman bungalows as well as transitional ranch are represented within the neighborhood.  Francis Quarles Story  Francis Quarles Story In 1887, Francis Quarles Story, a Boston wool merchant whose ill health had taken him to California a decade before, purchased the area that is today the F.Q. Story Historic District. He had settled in Los Angeles County, studied the cultivation of citrus, planted orange groves, and is credited with founding the national advertising campaign that made the Sunkist Orange famous. Active in many educational and conservation endeavors, F.Q. Story was a director and president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and a tireless booster of commercial and industrial enterprises in California and Arizona. Story and other prominent southern California landowners expanded into the Salt River Valley of Arizona in the late 1880s, investing in land and promoting both agricultural and townsite development. Although he never lived in Phoenix, Story was involved in numerous projects, such as the design and construction of the wide Grand Avenue thoroughfare in 1887 and the subsequent building of its streetcar line. In the early 1900s, Story was influential in the founding of the Grand Avenue and University Additions, but their development was disappointing. In spite of having announced in 1910 plans to subdivide the parcel, which would become the Story neighborhood, he sold the entire parcel to the Phoenix firm of Jordan, Grace and Phelps in 1919.  Promotion  In 1920, when development of what is now the F.Q. Story Historic District began, Phoenix had a population of 29,000; almost six times what it had been at the turn-of-the-century. Grand Avenue had been built to link central Phoenix with the thriving agricultural communities of Glendale and Peoria. Like the nearby Roosevelt neighborhood, Story was advertised as a streetcar suburb, being close to the Grand Avenue and Kenilworth car lines. As in other developments oriented to the street car, Story was laid out with narrow, deep lots. The streetcar line at the eastern edge of the neighborhood clustered the initial houses. By the middle of the decade, as the automobile became more common, houses located further west began to incorporate detached garages and side- yard port coheres appeared. Their presence reflects the growing impact of the automobile on architecture and suburban American life by the mid-1920s. When subdivision of the F.Q. Story Addition began, it was described in advertisements in the Arizona Republican in March 1920 as \\"The Real Estate Event of the Season!\\" and \\"The Place, the Thing, and the Time you have been waiting for.\\" Advertising boasted that the developers \\"expect to sell this entire tract within thirty days.\\" In spite of the hype, only one house was built in all of 1921. This was due to the fact that the area lay directly in the flood way of Cave Creek, which in 1921, inundated the entire western end of the city and put two feet of muddy water on the first floor of the state capitol just a mile to the south. No lives were lost, but property damages were severe and estimated to have exceeded the million-dollar mark.  Residential development  After Cave Creek Dam was completed in 1923, thirteen more homes were built, and in January 1924, the Dwight B. Heard Investment Company reopened the original Story Addition. The newly formed partnership of Lane-Smith opened North Story, and by 1926, a total of 113 homes had been built on streets from Roosevelt and McDowell between 7th and 9th Avenues. Both sections had a requirement that buildings cost a minimum of $5000. The subdivision also had gas and electrical service. Kenilworth School had opened in 1920, and in 1926, Franklin School was built on McDowell at 17th Avenue.  Development accelerates  The last development phase of the Story Addition began in 1927 when \\"New Story\\" opened, covering the from 11th to I 5th Avenues, between McDowell Road and Roosevelt Street. At $3000 to $4000, building restrictions were slightly lower here and duplexes were permitted in certain sections. In July 1927, the developers, Lane-Smith Investment Company, encouraged sales by having A.F. Wasielewski Construction Company construct a \\"model home\\" at 1106 West Lynwood, a novel idea for the period. By September, forty more homes had been built. At the same time, the remaining westerly portion of F.Q. Story's land was opened as \\"West Story\\" by developers Cowley, Higgins and Delph Company. It was also known as Franklin Addition, named for the new primary school nearby. Building restrictions were more modest still, just $2500 and $2200, which allowed working families to build in the area. Development hit its peak in 1930 with the construction of 133 new houses, only to falter as the effects of the Great Depression hit Phoenix. Construction declined, but by 1938, approximately seventy-five percent of the F.Q. Story Addition had been developed.  Typical Phoenix neighborhood  People of wealth and influence, who bought large blocks of land for resale, never intending to live in the area, invested in the F.Q. Story neighborhood as a speculative venture. In its historic period, it was a typical middle-class neighborhood. In the eastern sections with the higher building restrictions, the earliest Story residents were mainly of white-collar status professional people such as physicians, lawyers, presidents and owners of small to medium- sized companies. On the west side were government personnel, sales people of all kinds, and a number of contractors who built in the area. All three partners in the realty company of Cowley, Higgins and Delph lived in \\"West Story,\\" as did a number of O'Malley Lumber Company employees. The people who were first drawn to the neighborhood were considered one of its primary attractions. At one point during its development, the Price & Price Investment Company ran an advertisement listing the names and occupations of nearly all Story Addition property owners in an attempt to encourage sales. Homes were fairly small and, even at their most lavish, relatively inexpensive in comparison with some of the other emerging Phoenix neighborhoods of this era.  Neighborhood commercial activity  The developers of Story Addition in the 1927-28 period also planned for commercial activities in the neighborhood. Commercial buildings were constructed in eight locations. Characteristic of commercial development of the period, these buildings were located on corner lots on McDowell, Roosevelt, and Grand Avenue, the chief thoroughfares. The only building constructed during this time, which remains intact in the neighborhood today, is the Pay'n Takit Market at 7th Avenue and Roosevelt. This small grocery was the twenty-third store opened up by the Pay'n Takit Grocery Company. A Phoenix chain founded in 1917, they promoted the innovative concept of self-service or cash and carry.\\" The importance of this early commercial building to the neighborhood is recognized with its individual listing on the National Register of Historic Places.  Architectural styles  Much of the architectural significance of the F.Q. Story Historic District relates to its representation of the increasing popularity of period styles, which was typical of early twentieth century American residential design. The Bungalow style prevailed in the eastern sections developed in the early 1920s. Period Revival houses - those that use the form and ornamentation of earlier architectural styles - prevailed by the mid-1920s. Spanish Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival homes were the most popular, but examples of other Revival styles, such as English and Norman Cottage, Mediterranean, Pueblo, Mission, and Neoclassical are common. Art Modern, Ranch Style and Prairie houses were also scattered through the area. Spanish Colonial Revival houses take their characteristics from the Southwestern architectural tradition. Identifying features include flat or low-pitched roofs with little or no overhang, red tile roof shingles, prominent arches over doors, windows and porches, and an asymmetrical stuccoed facade. In contrast, Tudor Revival homes draw from the medieval architecture of Europe. These dwellings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs, and are often ornamented with half timbering. They also are identifiable by their picturesque massing, multiple pane window groupings and massive brick chimneys.  Significance  Today, as in the past, the F.Q. Story Historic District is a thriving neighborhood characterized by diversity. Historically, it remains an important expression of the people and the building practices that established Phoenix as a progressive twentieth century city. The form of the neighborhood, the placement and arrangement of the buildings, and its distinctive landscaping all contribute to a character that reflects the economies, technology and popular tastes of a bygone era. Story is architecturally important because it displays a wide range of historic styles from the 1920s and 1930s that illustrate the changing architectural trends of the period.

Description The streaked shearwater feeds mainly on fish and squid. It follows fishing boats, attracted to anchovy crawls off Japan and have been known to be taken as by-catch in nets or drowned when ingesting the bait on long-line fishing lines. The streaked shearwater nests in burrows. It prefers forested hills. This bird is abundant and widespread, however some mortality occurs through becoming entangled in fishing nets, and from some predation by cats and rats. In addition, it is harvested by some traditional endemic human cultures. Off Gold Coast, Australia Distribution This species is pelagic, but is also found in inshore waters. It occurs in the Pacific Ocean, nesting in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, predominately on their offshore islands. After breeding, the streaked shearwater migrate south, feeding in the seas off northern New Guinea, the Arafura Sea, and the South China Sea. Calonectris leucomelas have also been reported well off the west coast of the United States, from the southern coast of India, and from New Zealand.

The mineral ringwoodite is named after him. Early life and study Ringwood was born in Kew, only child of Alfred Edward Ringwood. He attended Hawthorn West State School where he played cricket and Australian Rules football. In 1943 he was successful in gaining a scholarship to Geelong Grammar School where he boarded. On matriculation, he enrolled in Geology a science degree at the University of Melbourne where he held a Commonwealth Government Scholarship, and was awarded a resident scholarship at Trinity College. He represented the college and the University in football. He obtained First Class Honours degree in Geology and began a MSc degree in field-mapping and petrology of the Devonian Snowy River volcanics of northeastern Victoria, graduating with Honours in 1953. Ringwood then undertook a PhD, beginning an experimental study about the origin of metalliferous ore deposits, but later changed his research topic so as to apply geochemistry to an understanding of the structure of the Earth, in particular the mineralogical constitution of the Earth's mantle. Germanate and earth's mantle In the late 1950s and 1960s Ringwood worked on germanates. He discovered that they served as low-pressure analogue to high- pressure silicates. With this insight he was able to predict that the phase changes of the mantle minerals olivine and pyroxene should occur in the Transition Zone. At the Australian National University he began experimental study of silicates at high pressure, and in 1959 demonstrated that the iron end-member of olivine indeed transformed to the denser spinel structure, as did numerous germanate and germanate-silicate solid solutions. In 1966, Ringwood and Alan Major, the technical officer who worked with him from 1964 to 1993, synthesised the spinel form of (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, Also in 1966, the transformation of pure forsterite (Mg2SiO4) to spinel-like phase was achieved. In 1969 a new mineral was discovered in fragments of the Tenham meteorite which had the same crystal structure as the high pressure spinel polymorph of olivine. This was the first time that Ringwood's predicted polymorph was found in nature. Honouring the importance of Ringwood's work the mineral was named ringwoodite. A team from the University of Alberta have isolated terrestrial ringwoodite in a brown diamond specimen found in Brazil in 2008. Their research suggests the presence of water deep within the Earth's mantle. Later life In 1978, his ANU team invented synroc, a possible means of safely storing and disposing of radioactive waste. Ringwood died of lymphoma on 12 November 1993 at the age of 63. Honours Ringwood received numerous honours and awards for his work. * 1993 Jaeger Medal * 1993 Harry H.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Diocese of Alba\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016  History  The earliest figure in the traditional list of the bishops of Alba is a St. Dionysius, of whom the story is told that after serving in Alba for some years he became Archbishop of Milan. He was the Dionysius who so energetically opposed Arianism and was exiled in the year 355 by the Emperor Constans. Daniel PapebrochDaniel Papebroch, in: disputes the reliability of this tradition, since a bishop of that period was forbidden to leave his diocese for another.Savio, p. 49. A list of nine early bishops of Alba, from another St. Dionysius (380) down to a Bishop Julius (553), was compiled from sepulchral inscriptions found in the cathedral of Alba towards the end of the fifteenth century by Dalmazzo Berendenco, an antiquarian. Giovanni Battista De Rossi, however, on examination of the inscriptions proved them to be a forgery. Paul Fridolin Kehr remarks (p. 185), Seriem episcoporum Albensium inde ab a. 380, incipientem a. s. Dionysio, ad annum usque 553, quam ex epitaphiis Dalmatius Berardencus congessisse perhiberetur, a Meyranesio abbate confictam esse constat. (...they were forged by Abbot Meyranesius.) The first bishop of Alba whose existence is certain is Lampradius who was present at the synod held in Rome in 499 under Pope Symmachus.Mansi, VIII, 235, Mon. Germ. Hist., Auct. Antiq. XII, 400. In the series of bishops, Benzo of Alba is notable as an adversary of Pope Gregory VII and a partisan of the Empire in the Investiture controversy.Orsi, \\"Un libellista del sec. XI\\", in \\"Rivista storica Italiana\\", 1884, p. 427. The Emperor Frederick Barbarossa spent Christmas of 1159 in Alba. The prominence of natives of Mantua among the bishops of Alba in the 16th and 17th centuries is accounted for by the grant of the Marquisate of Montferrat to the Dukes of Mantua by the Emperor Charles V in 1536. With the marquisate came the patronage previously enjoyed by the Dukes of Savoy. This arrangement persisted until 1708, when the House of Savoy acquired Montferrat and the patronage over the bishopric of Alba.Cappelletti, p. 170. Bishop Lodovico Gonzaga held a diocesan synod in 1636. A diocesan synod, the first in more than thirty years, was held by Bishop Eugenio Roberto Galletti in September 1873. Cathedral and Chapter The office of Penitentiary in the Cathedral Chapter was created by Bishop Paolo Brizio de Braida on 15 January 1644.Bima, p. 318. In 1856 the Chapter was composed of five dignities and fourteen Canons. The dignities were: the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Provost, the Cantor, and the Dean. The cathedral was considered a parish church, and was supervised by the Archpriest; there were two residentiary chaplains.Cappelletti, p. 173. French conquest When the French revolution guillotined King Louis XVI, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia declared war on the French Republic, but in three successive engagements, the Battle of Montenotte (12 April 1796), the Battle of Millesimo (13‚Äì14 April 1796) and the Battle of Mondovi (21 April 1796), General Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Piedmontese. In suing for peace, Victor Amadeus was forced to cede Savoy and Nice to France. The territory became part of the Department of Mont-Blanc. King Victor Amadeus died on 18 October 1796, and his son and successor, Carlo Emanuele was forced to abdicate on 6 December 1798.The King retreated to the Island of Sardinia. Bonaparte crossed the Alps again in the Spring of 1800, intent on driving the Austrians out of the Po Valley. The victory at the Battle of Marengo gave the French control of most of Lombardy. The French government, in the guise of ending the practices of feudalism, confiscated the incomes and benefices of the bishops and priests, and made them employees of the state, with a fixed income and the obligation to swear an oath of loyalty to the French constitution. As in metropolitan France, the government program also included reducing the number of bishoprics, making them conform as far as possible with the civil administration's \\"departments\\". Following the Concordat of 1801 between Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the Pope issued a bull, Gravissimis causis (1 June 1803), in which the number of diocese in Piedmont was reduced to eight: Turin, Vercelli, Ivrea, Acqui, Asti, Mondovi, Alessandria and Saluzzo. Alba was suppressed, and its territory was handed over to the diocese of Asti. Bishop Vitale of Alba was required to resign. The Kingdom of Sardinia and the Papal States (which had been abolished by the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte) were restored by the Congress of Vienna. The confused situation of the dioceses in Piedmont was addressed by Pope Pius VII in his bull, Beati Petri (17 July 1817)Bullarii Romani continuatio, VII, pp. 1490-1503, ¬ß 11. as far as the redrawing of diocesan boundaries was concerned.

Description Airport crash tenders are extremely powerful machines. They offer relatively good acceleration for their size and weight, are able to negotiate rough terrain outside the airport area, carry large capacities of water and fire fighting foam, are fitted with powerful high-capacity pumps and water/foam cannons, and are capable of delivering firefighting media over long distances. They can be mounted on 4x4, 6x6, or even 8x8 wheeled chassis. In order to decrease their turning radius, the 8x8 wheeled unit may have all four front wheels steerable. Newer airport crash tenders also incorporate twin- agent nozzles/injection systems to inject a stream of Purple-K dry chemical into the AFFF firefighting foam stream, knocking-down the fire faster. Some also have Halotron tanks with handlines for situations that require a clean agent to be utilized. These features give the airport crash tenders a capability to reach an airplane rapidly, and rapidly put out large fires with jet fuel involved. Some tenders have an elevated extended extinguishing arm, giving a possibility to raise a water/foam cannon into the height of approximately 10 to 20 meters, that can puncture through superficial structures of an aeroplane to fight a fire inside the fuselage.Relyea; Robert G., Garnett; Edward V.: United States Patent Application, February 8, 1993. http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=5301756 Some arms have a reinforced nozzle, called a snozzle, that, according to the United States National Transportation Safety Board is a \\"piercing nozzle on the fire truck that is used to penetrate an airplane's fuselage and dispense AFFF to extinguish fire inside the cabin or cargo area.\\"NTSB Standards The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has given standards and recommended practices on rescue fire fighting categories of civil aerodromes.ICAO: Volume 1 - Aerodrome Design and Operations. Annex 14: Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) requirementsICAO: Airport Services Manual. Part 1 - Rescue and Fire Fighting. 3rd edition, 1990Find relevant ICAO standards and recommended practices on SKYbrary National aviation authorities may have given even further requirements on aerodrome rescue and fire services. The rescue fire services are based on a critical aircraft based on a statistical analysis of movements (take-offs and landings) on the airport. The aerodrome category is based on the size of the biggest aircraft taking a movement on the aerodrome. In addition, the number of movements of the critical aircraft is calculated, and the category can be decreased by one if the number of movements is lower than the standard describes. For example, at an airport regularly handling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft with a single Boeing 777 service per week, the airport fire service has to cater up to the ICAO category 7 of the 737 and A320; a single 777 movement per week does not justify a full ICAO category 9 fire service. There are also minimum category levels based on e.g. the number of seats in the critical aircraft.Categories for Fire Fighting and Minimum Fire Fighting Capacity Depending on the airport category, the standards determine the minimum number of rescue fire-fighting vehicles. In addition, requirements are given on the water and foam capacities, discharge rates for foam solutions, and minimum dry chemical powder (complementary agent) amounts, reserve stocks of fire fighting agents, ability to operate on rough terrain, and acceleration of the air crash tenders. The end of each runway has to be achieved in a response time of two minutes, and any part of the movement area has to be achieved in a response time not exceeding three minutes.  Range of airport firefighting vehicles Airport rescue and firefighting services operate many specialist vehicles to provide emergency cover at airports. They include: 1) Crash tenders (as described above) 2) \\"Domestic\\" type fire appliances. Domestic appliances are similar in function and appearance to fire appliances operated by local fire services / departments. They are not as large or as heavy as airport crash tenders. The units are ordinarily used to respond to fire incidents in airport terminal buildings but also respond to aircraft incidents.

It originally aired on Fox on September 10, 2006. The episode features Stewie becoming overly affectionate with his mother Lois after an incident. Meanwhile, Peter gets a prostate exam from Dr. Hartman, but believes that he has been raped instead, and decides to prosecute his doctor in court. The episode was written by Mark Hentemann and directed by Mike Kim. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline, and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.93 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Ellen Albertini Dow, Dave Boat, Phil LaMarr, Kevin Michael Richardson and Anne-Michelle Seiler, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot Quahog becomes the subject of a flu epidemic, and Peter goes to see Dr. Hartman for a vaccine. Although the vaccines are in short supply and must be saved for the elderly, Peter manages to get one anyway (by pretending to fall onto the syringe). While looking through Peter's papers, Hartman realizes that Peter has not had a prostate exam. Peter agrees to get one, despite not knowing what it involves. Upon receiving the procedure, Peter feels sexually violated and proceeds to tell Lois about his ordeal, and she is rather unsupportive and finds it amusing, up to the point to calling him a \\"fuckin' idiot\\".Note that this only occurs in the DVD version; on TV, this is censored as \\"(bleep)in' idiot\\". He then suffers a mental breakdown and tells his friends about the incident, at which point they reveal that Dr. Hartman has also \\"raped\\" them. Peter decides to sue Hartman in a court of law, and Lois is unable to talk him out of it. Meanwhile, Stewie plays at the park with his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, retrieves Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he has had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again. In the courtroom, Peter exaggerates the story. The judge is not convinced, and even recalls his own prostate exam being uneventful. However, after further prompting from Peter, the judge \\"remembers\\" being abused and declares Hartman guilty, revoking his license. As Peter celebrates his victory at The Drunken Clam, his frequent need to urinate causes great concern among his friends, where Seamus, the peg-limbed sailor, informs him that his prostate may be infected, and if he doesn't get it checked, it'll likely get worse. This makes Peter finally understand that a prostate exam is an important and legitimate medical procedure. However, his lawsuit makes it unlikely that any doctor would treat him, and indeed, not one does. Realizing the critical situation he has placed himself in, Peter has no choice but to seek Dr. Hartman for help. He visits Dr. Hartman in disguise and unsuccessfully tries to trick him into giving the exam. Peter admits that he was wrong and pleads Hartman to help him. Despite what Peter did to him, the doctor decides that his Hippocratic Oath requires him to go ahead with the examination anyway. Peter's constant urinating turns out to be due to a minor infection and blockage caused by Mr. Sulu somehow being up Peter's rectum. In the epilogue, Dr. Hartman's license is reinstated, and he and Peter reconcile. Production Writer Mark Hentemann wrote the episode. When Stewie is fantasizing about murdering and harming Lois, he performs several karate and kung-fu moves. This is a reference to an individual whom Mark Hentemann, a writer for Family Guy, used to know. He was the boy who would come to school, car washes or other events and tell stories about the people who he had been in physical fights with. During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of Bonnie Hunt, MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast ‚Äî Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made. On the uncut version of this episode, there is a scene where Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's mouth for Lois's genitals, muttering, \\"Oh, you are so ready!\\" The edited TV version does not have this part, but leaves in the first half, in which Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's nose for Lois's nipple. For a reason which was not specified, the sound of Lois's footsteps when going down the basement stairs during her dream of killing Stewie, had to be overcome by Stewie talking more often. This line of Stewie making general conversation in the same scene, was altered several times due to lack of laughter from the audience. MacFarlane comments that the scene of Peter standing up to his teacher who was giving the class a test, is a reference to \\"80's TV bullshit\\". In addition to the regular cast, actress Ellen Albertini Dow, voice actors Dave Boat, Phil LaMarr and Kevin Michael Richardson, and actress Anne-Michelle Seiler guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, Alex Breckenridge, writer Mike Henry, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Recurring cast members Adam West and Patrick Warburton guest starred in the episode as well. Cultural references During the scene when a car is about to fall off a cliff, Robin the Boy Wonder appears and attempts to save the people. However, upon arrival, he is criticized as he will not be able to save them: this is a reference to the portrayal of Robin from the 1960s Batman series. Throughout the episode, other references are made to fictitious super heroes. In total, three references were made to Star Trek, all of which involve Star Trek actor George Takei's character, Mr. Sulu. When Peter has a flashback about passing his college test he is running around with the song \\"I'm Free\\" by Kenny Loggins playing in the background. This is a reference to the movie Footloose. When Peter is recounting what Hartman did to him, he goes into a flashback in court, and everything turns black and white and grainy: this is a reference to The Accused, starring Jodie Foster. During one of the kitchen scenes, Brian teases Stewie singing \\"Stewie loves Lois!\\" Stewie retorts by singing, \\"Brian loves Olympia Dukakis!\\" To which he replies, \\"Oh yeah, I do.\\" When Stewie imagines how a holiday in Hawaii would be with Rupert, he references the classic Calvin and Hobbes series. Lois makes a reference to Barbara Bush after waking up from her dream of killing Stewie. She claims \\"I'm just like that Texas woman who gave her son brain damage by holding him underwater, I'm just like Barbara Bush\\". When the fisherman is telling Peter about the serious consequences of not getting a prostate exam, he shows Peter a picture of band Primus, to which Peter asks him why he carries such random pictures around with him. The closing credits are a reference to All in the Family, an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS in the 1970s. At the beginning of the credits, the voice of Peter says \\"Family Guy was recorded on tape before a live audience\\" as 'footage' of the city of Quahog is shown. Reception IGN's Dan Iverson commented that \\"the Stewie/Lois story was really kind of funny\\", noting that the scene was \\"a nice window in on parenting\\". He describes the scene of Stewie shouting at Brian in Spanish as being \\"very funny\\". However, Iverson criticized the episode, noting that the scene of Peter giving his story in court went from just \\"creepy and awkward to just plain disturbing\\". The episode received a final rating by Iverson of 4.5/10. 9.93 million people watched this episode in the US on its first airing ranking #2 on FOX that night behind The Simpsons, this episode was the highest rated of season five.

The WFF is a response and also a search for alternatives to a kind of globalization that understands that the human sense of life overrides trade and the laws of the neoliberal market. It was founded in Quebec, Canada in 1995 after a number of fishworker organizations and concerned intellectuals, academics and social activists felt that while the World Trade Organization (WTO)‚Äôs Doha mandate declared that the priority of the current round of negotiations is to lift people out of poverty and promote sustainable development, the current WTO negotiations fail to incorporate their concerns and priorities, as well as those of traditional fishing communities everywhere. The WFF currently represents 48 national organizations of traditional small-scale fishing communities in 42 nations, whose livelihoods depend directly on the sustainable management of fisheries resources. It acts as a world body representing the concerns of traditional fishing communities whose survival is directly threatened by the reduction of the role of governments in regulating fisheries. The organization has four principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Regional Councils (in charge of ensuring the coordination of the regional members); the Coordination Committee (in charge of representing the WFF); and the Executive Committee (in charge of handling all administrative and financial matters). The WFF's most public figures are the WFF's co-presidents, currently Margaret Nakato and Arthur Bogason (both since 2009). The organization is mainly funded from membership fees, donations, grants or any other source deemed acceptable by the Coordination Committee. The organization has three official languages: English, Spanish and French.  History  The WFF was formed in 1995 as the result of a meeting between national organizations for coastal fishing and the fishing industry in the city of Qu√©bec. The first general meeting of the forum took place in New Delhi in 1997. Following the actual establishment of the global organization in November 1997, the WFF's Coordinating Committee met in Brussels and, in October 1999, the Committee held its first meeting in the United States at Point Montara, California. A new general assembly was held in Lisbon in 2004. The current Constitution of the WFF replaced the WFF Interim Charter of 1997.  Organization  The WFF is based on four primary organs: the General Assembly, the Coordination Committees, an Executive Committee, and the Regional Councils. The head office of the WWF has been situated in Uganda since February 2010, hosted by the Katosi Women Development Trust (KWDT). General Assembly The General Assembly constitutes the WFF's highest authority. It takes place at least once every three years in a location decided by the Coordination Committee. The functions of the General Assembly are to make official interpretations of and amendments to the constitution of the WFF, to discuss issues of common interest and adopt resolutions on subjects on the agenda, within a spirit of cooperation and of exchange of ideas, to decide on the action required to implement decisions and fulfill the objectives of the WFF and to assign tasks or duties to the Coordination Committee. The General Assembly is composed of all the delegates representing members who attend the meeting. Each country, with at least one active member shall be entitled to representation at the General Assembly by two delegates, one of whom shall be male and the other female. Large countries, as designated by the Coordination Committee, shall be entitled to a third delegate. Each active member is entitled to nominate auditors and/or alternate delegates to participate at the General Assembly with the right to speak. This auditors or delegates must be approved by the Coordination Committee. Countries with more than one active member shall try to agree on the delegates‚Äô representation. Each delegate has the right to vote on any item put before the General Assembly. Votes involving constitutional approval and amendments, suspension or expulsion of a member, and the dissolution of the WFF, shall require two- thirds majority vote of delegates voting and shall also require the support of a simple majority (50 + 1%) of the countries which are represented by delegates at the General Assembly. All other decisions of the General Assembly shall be made by simple majority of the number of votes cast. However, a consensus should always be tried to be reached in the decision-making process. Coordination Committee The Coordination Committee acts under the authority of the General Assembly to represents the WFF. The mandate for the members of the Coordination Committee lasts for the period until the next General Assembly, which will normally be for three years. Each member of the Coordination Committee has the right to one vote. Decisions by the Committee are taken by simple majority. Other than the duties that may be delegated by the General Assembly, the Coordination Committee is also in charge of promoting the creation of regional councils, planning and managing the activities of the WFF, organizing the General Assembly, proposing recommendations to the General Assembly, implement measures decided upon by the General Assembly, representing the WFF with other organizations, admitting new members, reporting on its activities to the General Assembly, maintaining close links among members of the WFF during periods in which the General Assembly is not in session and taking any measures deemed necessary to accomplish the objectives set out by the organization. Executive Committee The Executive Committee acts under the authority of the Coordination Committee and is in charge of handling all administrative and financial matters of the WFF. It shall be composed of five representatives elected from among the members of the coordination committee. There shall be one president, two vice-presidents, one secretary, and one treasurer. The mandate of the Executive Committee members shall be for a maximum term of three years. Meetings may be called by the President or Secretary without previous notice and should be held in the time and place that they determine. Regional Councils The WFF recognizes any regional council which complies with the objectives of the WFF. The main goal of the regional councils is to ensure the coordination and the consultation of the regional members from the countries representing the regions and continents.  Membership  The WFF currently represents 48 national organizations of traditional small-scale fishing communities in 42 nations located all over the world, whose livelihoods depend directly on the sustainable management of fisheries resources. Such organizations must be democratically constituted and represent one of the following groups: Fish harvesters, crewmembers of fishing units, organizations of women engaged in work in support of the fishery, and fish workers who are engaged in activities related to the processing, sale (excluding merchants) or transport of fish. The Coordination Committee is the one in charge of admitting active members to the organization.  Stated objectives  The WFF works towards the establishment and upholding of fundamental human rights, social justice and culture of fish harvesters and fish workers, affirming the sea as source of all life and committing themselves to sustain fisheries and aquatic resources from the present and future generations, to protect their livelihood. The objectives of the WFF are the ones that follow: * To protect, defend, and strengthen the economic viability and quality of life for fish harvesters, fish workers and the communities that depend on the fishery for their livelihood. * To assist member organizations to secure and improve upon the economic viability and quality of life of fish harvesters, fish workers and their communities. * To create an understanding of the resource as a common heritage of humanity and, through sustainable fishing practices, conservation and the regeneration of marine and inland resources and ecosystems, to ensure that it is passed on to future generations. * To promote food security, both locally and worldwide, by sustaining fish stocks for the future, and by reserving fish for human consumption. * To prevent the export of resource collapse crises and of technologies and practices that lead to these crises. * To acknowledge and enhance the unique culture of fishing communities. * To protect fishing communities, fish resources and fish habitats such as coastal zones, watersheds and mangroves, from both land-based and sea-based threats. These include displacement by tourism, pollution (including the use of sea as a dumping ground for toxic waste), destructive industrial aquaculture, overfishing and destructive fishing practices. * To promote a legal regime that will ensure the traditional and customary rights of fishing communities to the fishery under the national jurisdiction. * To establish and assert the rights of fishing communities to their customary territories in the coastal zone, under their national jurisdiction for fishing and habitation. * To play a monitoring role to ensure that states and transnational corporations comply with relevant international agreements and to oppose any trade agreements that threaten the livelihood of fishers. * To promote the primary role of fish harvester and fish worker organizations in managing fisheries and oceans nationally and internationally. * To promote equitable representation of fish harvester and fish worker organizations in all relevant regional and international fora and to advocate their recognition. * To provide support for national and international struggles that are consistent with the objectives of the World Forum. * To encourage, assist and support fish harvesters and fish workers to organize where they have not already done so. * To promote the right of fish harvesters and fish workers to social security, safe working conditions, fair income and safety at sea, as well as their recognition as seafarers. * To recognize, protect and enhance the role of women in the fishing economy and in the sustenance of the community. * To improve the communication between fish harvesters and the scientific community through the exchange of knowledge and science.

He started his career by participating in World War I and making a successful escape after being taken captive by Austria-Hungary.

Among his most famous works are Seven Nannies (1962), Aybolit-66 (1966), Attention, a Turtle! (1970) and Scarecrow (1983). His films are generally associated with postmodernism, presented as a mix of different styles, genres and techniques, with theatrical musical numbers, arthouse editing, fourth wall breaking and so on. An unexpectedly grim Scarecrow released in 1984 became especially controversial and led to a lot of public criticism; some insisted it should be banned. Bykov survived a heart attack in the process. Yet in 1986 with the start of perestroika he was awarded the USSR State Prize for his movie.

It is listed as Endangered by IUCN because of an ongoing population decline, estimated to be more than 50% over the last three generations, inferred from over-exploitation, habitat destruction and degradation. Chrotogale is a monospecific genus. Owston's palm civet is named after the wildlife collector Alan Owston.  Characteristics  The Owston's palm civet is a mid-sized palm civet at 57 cm (23 in), plus a tail of 43 cm (17 in). With its pointed face, it is sometimes thought to resemble a large insectivore, such as a shrew. It has a tawny buff-grey body with highly contrasted black markings on its back and tail. They usually only have 4 bands on their back. The last two-thirds of the tail is completely black. They look somewhat like the banded palm civet, Hemigalus derbyanus, except for that the hair on the back of their neck are not reversed, and the Owston's has spots on its legs.  Distribution and habitat  Owston's palm civet lives in the forests and wooded lowland river basins of northern Vietnam, northern Laos and southern China.  Ecology and behaviour  Very little is known about their life history in the wild, though limited information has been gathered on captive animals. They feed mostly on earthworms and other invertebrates. The mating season is apparently in late January. After a gestation period of 3 months, a litter of 1-3 young are born.  Conservation   In captivity  The Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program, based at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, runs an international conservation and breeding programme for them in cooperation with various zoos including Newquay Zoo.

The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 The water course was also known as the Vincent River, after Sir Mathias Vincent, who purchased land (now West and East Vincent Townships) along it in Chester County in 1686. French Creek travels through the Hopewell Big Woods, including French Creek State Park, and joins the Schuylkill in Phoenixville. French Creek is a designated Pennsylvania Scenic River. The French Creek valley was an important early industrial region, particularly iron, in the United States. Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site along French Creek interprets this history. The Phoenix Iron Works site in Phoenixville, an active iron and steel producer from colonial times until the late 20th century, sits astride the creek just before it joins the Schuylkill. In 1994, the Green Valleys Association (GVA) with its 38 co-petitioners filed a petition with the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board for the upgrade of the French Creek watershed from a designation of High Quality (HQ) to Exceptional Value (EV). In September 1998, the French Creek watershed west of PA 100 and the Birch Run watershed were granted this upgrade. In 2003, Green Valleys and its 48 co-petitioners successfully filed a petition to obtain an upgrade from HQ to EV of the lower reaches of French Creek, from the Kennedy Covered Bridge in East Vincent and East Pikeland Townships upstream to PA 100 in South Coventry Township as well as the entire Beaver Run. This petition was accepted by the Environmental Quality Board in February 2004 and is currently being reviewed.

After the commercially unsuccessful 1992 album Priest=Aura, founding guitarist Peter Koppes had departed, leaving the band down to just two original members, Steve Kilbey and Marty Willson-Piper, plus Priest's drummer Jay Dee Daugherty. With the group's future uncertain, the members took time off to focus on other projects, while Koppes began to establish a solo career with his new group, The Well, which included former band mate Richard Ploog. Kilbey began a Jack Frost collaboration with Grant McLennan (of The Go-Betweens) and Willson-Piper returned to the studio with UK group All About Eve, to record their album Ultraviolet. Arista Records decided to stand by their contract with the band and back another album, despite the loss of Koppes, and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began writing new material. When it became clear that drummer Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity and electronica. Song construction became freer, with each musician playing multiple tracks on various instruments, to be cut down and refined into finished pieces later. The two likened their approach to a sculptor's creative process, the pieces gradually taking shape as the work went on. Early in 1994, they brought in Willson-Piper's childhood friend Andy 'Dare' Mason to produce, record and mix the album. It was recorded at Sydney's Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301, except \\"The Maven\\", \\"Leave Your Clothes On\\" & \\"Freeze to Burn\\", which were recorded and mixed at Fryshuset, Stockholm, Sweden by Martin R√∂ssel. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles was hired for the Sydney sessions, having already played with Kilbey on the Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later. Sometime Anywhere was generally well-received and peaked in the Australian Top 30. A 7-track bonus disc, entitled Somewhere Else, was included with the initial pressings. It was described as a \\"rich, dark, epic release which picked up where Priest=Aura left off, with lush, lengthy tracks\\". However, sales were lower than their previous studio albums and the first single, \\"Two Places at Once\\", did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church's contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo. In 2005 the album was remastered and reissued in Australia by EMI, with a second disc which included all of the Somewhere Else tracks except \\"Drought\\" (which was moved to Priest=Aura), plus the radio and video edits of \\"Two Places at Once\\".

It was the eleventh tropical storm, seventh hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season, Kate developed from a tropical wave in the central tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned sharply westward while moving around a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125 mph (205 km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing to the east of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia. The storm had minimal effects on land, limited to moderately strong winds and heavy rainfall over Newfoundland. Kate threatened Atlantic Canada just one week after Hurricane Juan caused severe damage in Nova Scotia. Meteorological history On September 21, a tropical wave ‚Äì a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure ‚Äì began moving slowly westward from the west coast of Africa, passing near the Cape Verde islands on September 23. Though the wave was disorganized, a low-level circulation developed on September 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of Cape Verde. Steady organization ensued, including the development of convection into curved bands around the system. Though it lacked a well-defined center, the system organized enough to be classified Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920 mi (1,480 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression moved northwestward due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Despite early predictions of steady strengthening to reach 60 mph (95 km/h) within 48 hours, the depression remained weak due to strong south-southwesterly wind shear. The shear remained strong, and though the National Hurricane Center forecast the system to remain a depression through September 30, the depression unexpectedly strengthened to Tropical Storm Kate on September 27, coinciding with an increase in deep convection near the center. Kate turned to the north and northeast, and despite 35 mph (55 km/h) of shear over the storm Kate continued to strengthen. A banding eye developed early on September 29, and later that day it intensified into a hurricane while located 655 mi (1,055 km) southwest of the Azores. Hurricane Kate maintained hurricane status for twelve hours before decelerating to the north and weakening to a tropical storm. The storm then turned sharply west- southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid-level circulation. Passing over progressively warmer waters and into an area with decreasing vertical shear, Kate regained hurricane status on October 1. Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south, the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30¬∞ N, and presented a well-defined eye on October 2. On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status, and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h) while located 650 mi (1,050 km) east of Bermuda. Shortly after peaking, the western portion of the central dense overcast, or the area of high, thick clouds around the eye, began to deteriorate, and Hurricane Kate started to weaken. On October 5, the storm dropped below major hurricane status. Kate turned sharply northward due to it moving around the western periphery of a powerful anticyclone, and consequently slowed its forward motion. It slowly weakened as it turned to the north-northeast, with an eye occasionally re-appearing on satellite images. On October 7, however, Kate weakened to a tropical storm while moving over cooler waters. It accelerated to the northeast, and after passing about 260 mi (420 km) east of Newfoundland, Kate became extratropical as cold air clouds entrained the center. The system remained a powerful system, and later on October 8 the extratropical remnant of Kate retained winds of up to 75 mph (140 km/h) while passing south of Greenland. The storm turned to the east, passed a short distance south of Iceland, and merged with another extratropical storm near Scandinavia on October 10. Preparations and impact Just a week after Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take appropriate actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3 in (80 mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries in the event of power outages). A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33 feet (10 m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well. From September 28 to October 7, 33 ships reported winds of over 40 mph (65 km/h) in relation to Kate, though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59 mph (95 km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989 mbar. The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 3‚Äì4 foot (1 m) waves along the coast of North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40 mph (65 km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9‚Äì13 feet (3‚Äì4 m). The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4 inches (100 mm). St. John's reported 1.8 inches (45 mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70 mph (110 km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate.

They incorporated jazz, rock, pop and soul influences, becoming more commercial on their fifth and sixth albums. Reunion concert in 2006 History Their first eponymous LP comprised mainly instrumental pieces, complex yet repetitive in structure, with bassist Peter van der Sande singing on one track. He was succeeded by Guus Willemse around the time of its release, and immediately the band began recording more vocal songs; three of the tracks on second album Divergence featured lyrics. The third album Cordon Bleu (1975) was released on Elton John's own label named The Rocket Record Company, as was its follow-up Fully Interlocking (1977). Both albums were produced by John's producer Gus Dudgeon, and featured a crisper sound and more concise songwriting. Despite some criticism for a more commercial direction, the next two albums, ...It's Only Just Begun... (1980) and Runaway (1982) continued this trend. The two title tracks from these albums became hit singles in Europe. Solution split in 1983, playing a final concert at the Paradiso in Amsterdam and releasing a double live album. They have since regrouped (in March 2006) for two concerts at Panama, Amsterdam (released as a DVD in July 2007), while a triple CD compilation (The Ultimate Collection, comprising almost every track they released) was issued in 2005.

Historically the bay was much larger with many islets for which it was named. The rocks, or islets were engulfed within an encompassing shoreline, extending far enough eastward to interrupt the present-day Government Street. Currently tucked away in a snug little corner of the Inner Harbour surrounded by industrial activities, it is a challenge to glance at the troubled waters. Around 1885 the urban areas of Victoria continued to expand, and a bridge crossed the eastern section of Rock Bay, linking Government Street to the northern extension. During the mid-to- late 19th century, Fernwood contained a swampy marshland, and Hillside Farms existed between Bay Street and Hillside Avenue. Until approximately 1888 a creek visibly connected all these areas to discharge into Rock Bay of Victoria Upper Harbour. An unnamed creek once ran southwest from the swampy marshlands in Fernwood, under a bridge on Cedar Hill Road and past Hillside Farm. The creek meandered in the area of Kings Road to eventually provide a source of fresh water to Rock Bay. Around 1888 the creek was enclosed in pipes to provide direct drainage to the area to prevent floods in the expanding paved streets of Victoria. By 1887, a second wooden bridge known as Rock Bay Bridge connected the north and south shores of Rock Bay. The Rock Bay Bridge originally connected Bridge Street and Constance Street. Around 1903, the approach to Rock Bay Bridge was switched along the southern shore to Store Street. During the 1920s the Rock Bay bridge was dismantled while the eastern indent of Rock Bay was simultaneously being in filled to the west side of Government Street. Progressive shoreline changes continued until the late 1950s, resulting in the smaller area we now know as Rock Bay. Historical activities along the shores of Rock Bay included a tannery, sawmills, a coal gasification plant, a propane tank farm, and more recently a concrete batch plant and an asphalt plant.  Present-day  Rock Bay, which is purported to be one of the most highly contaminated bodies of water in the province, is (as of 2006) undergoing extensive cleanup by the Federal government.http://www.tc.gc.ca/mediaroom/releases/pac/2004/04-p002e.htm Decades of run off and pollution dumping from nearby gravel operations and former mills has led to current pollution levels. With the recent trend in urban living movements (more people moving into the downtown core), as is the case in many cities, Rock Bay is one of the few areas remaining in Victoria that lends itself to high development potential.http://www.fdarc.ca/portfolio/01.urb_Rock_Bay_3.php Rock Bay is also the future site of the Streetlink homeless shelter and housing, as of 2008.

The first scientific description by John Edward Gray in 1832 was based on a zoological specimen from the Maluku Islands in the collection of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden, Netherlands. It is blackish grey, has black paws and three black longitudinal stripes on the back. A monotypic genus, Arctogalidia means ‚Äòbear-weasel‚Äô (from ancient Greek arkto- ‚Äòbear‚Äô + galidia ‚Äòlittle weasel‚Äô). The specific epithet trivirgata means ‚Äòthree-striped‚Äô in Latin. The small-toothed palm civet is mid-sized by the standards of its family, weighing 2.4 kg (5.3 lbs) and measuring 53 cm (21 in) long along the body, plus a tail of 58 cm (23 in). It has short fur that is generally a tawny or buff color while the head is a darker greyish tawny. Its muzzle is brown with a white streak that extends from the nose to the forehead. Only the females have the perineal scent gland, located near the vulva. The diet is varied and omnivorous, and usually consists of insects, small mammals, nesting birds, fruits, frogs and lizards. Matching the habits of other palm civets, this species is solitary, arboreal and nocturnal. Its gestation period is 45 days, and the average litter size is 3, which are born in dens made in the trees. Young open their eyes at 11 days and are weaned at two months. It can have two litters a year and there is no set mating season. It can live for 11 years. It is threatened primarily by deforestation, as are many Southeast Asian forest animals.

He was born in 1835 in Norwich, England and died following a stroke in 1910 in Lastingham, Yorkshire, England. His gravestone and some other records report 1835 for his birth, some census records and other documents suggest 1836, but his baptismal record at St Mary's Baptist Chapel (referred to in Ringer's own will) confirms this was 1835. Life Born into a non-conformist family (often, but incorrectly described as 'Quaker') in Norwich, Ringer's father died in 1843, while he was still very young. His elder brother, John Melancthon, amassed a vast fortune in Shanghai, and his younger brother, Frederick, went to Japan, where he founded the company Holme, Ringer & Co in Nagasaki and became so successful he was given the name \\"King of Nagasaki\\". Ringer's entire professional career was associated with the University College Hospital, London. He entered University College in 1854 and graduated M.B. in 1860, being a resident medical officer in the University Medical Hospital from 1861 to 1862. He gained his M.D. in 1863 and that same year was appointed as assistant physician to the hospital, becoming a full physician in 1866. From 1865 to 1869, he also held the position of assistant physician at the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street. Ringer was an outstanding bedside teacher who continued the high standard of clinical instruction that had been established at the University College Hospital. He was not, however, in his element in set lectures. Ringer served successively as professor of materia medica, pharmacology and therapeutics, and the principles and practice of medicine at the University College faculty of medicine. In 1887, he was named Holme professor of clinical medicine, a chair he held until his retirement in 1900. In 1870 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and in 1885 a Fellow of the Royal Society. Ringer's Handbook of Therapeutics was a classic of its day and passed through thirteen editions between 1869 and 1897. This book was originally commissioned as a revision of Jonathan Pereira's (1804‚Äì1853) massive Elements of Materia Medica (first edition from 1839), but Ringer was little concerned with the minutiae of traditional medical botany and materia medical. He offered instead a thoroughly practical treatise in which the actions and indications of drugs were concisely summarised. Ringer was one of the early true clinical investigators. Patient care, clinical teaching, and writing occupied most of Ringer's career, but for many years he also maintained a small laboratory in the department of physiology; at that time there was no pharmacology laboratory at University College. He was universally known for his punctuality and the fanatical way he would spend every spare moment in his laboratory. It is even recorded that he climbed the palings of the hospital wall one evening when he found the door locked, to get to his laboratory. Following his morning round he would always make an appearance in the physiological laboratory and make suggestions to the laboratory assistant, examine the traces and then depart for his rooms at Cavendish Place, where he would do his consultant work. With the aid of a series of collaborators, including E. G. A. Morshead, William Murrell (1853‚Äì1912), Harrington Sainsbury, and Dudley Buxton, Ringer published between 1875 and 1895 more than thirty papers devoted to the actions of inorganic salts on living tissues. In the 1860s Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig had developed some perfusion techniques for the study of isolated organs. From the beginning the heart had served as the principal organ for these \\"extravital\\" investigations, and most of Ringer's physiological work relied on Ludwig's experimental model. In a classic series of experiments performed between 1882 and 1885, Ringer began with an isolated frog heart suspended in a 0.75% solution of sodium chloride. He then introduced additional substances (for example, blood and albumin) to the solution and observed the effects on the beating heart. He demonstrated that the abnormally prolonged ventricular dilation induced by pure sodium chloride solution is reversed by both blood and albumin. Ringer showed that small amounts of calcium in the perfusing solution are necessary for the maintenance of a normal heartbeat, a discovery he made after realising that instead of distilled water, his technician was actually using tap water containing (in London) calcium at nearly the same concentration as the blood. Ringer thus gradually perfected Ludwig's perfusion technique by proving that if small amounts of potassium are added to the normal solution of sodium chloride, isolated organs can be kept functional for long periods of time. This formed the basis of Ringer's solution, which became an immediate necessity for the physiological laboratory. Clinically important derivatives include Ringer's lactate. In 2007, a brief biography of RingerA Solution for the Heart (free pdf) was published by the Physiological Society, of which Ringer was an early member.

It has been listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008 as it occurs in many protected areas, is tolerant to some degree of habitat modification, and widely distributed with presumed large populations that are unlikely to be declining. The genus Paguma was first named and described by John Edward Gray in 1831. All described forms are regarded as a single species. In 2003, masked palm civets at a wildlife market in China were found to have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.  Characteristics  Skull of a masked palm civet In morphology the masked palm civet resembles other palm civets, but does not have spots or stripes. Its fur is reddish to grey, and it has a black and white facial mask. Its tail is more than two- thirds the length of head and body. It has three mammae.Pocock, R. I. (1939). Paguma larvata (Hamilton-Smith).. In: The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma: Mammalia Volume 1. Taylor and Francis, London. The mask consists of a prominent white stripe stretching from nose to forehead (sometimes extends farther but has greatly reduced thickness) that halves a black mask that extends laterally to the far edges of the cheeks and caudally up the forehead, past the ears, and down the back of the neck before stopping just under the shoulder blades. The eyes are surrounded by white fur that can vary from faint, incomplete outlines to well-defined blotches. The lips, chin, and throat are white. In some, white stripes of fur, comparable to sideburns on humans due to shape and location, curve up from the throat. These curves vary in thickness and have ends that terminate either in small blotches at the ear base or large blotches that surround the base of both darkly furred ears. No matter which coat it sports, masked palm civet's feet are always dark, often black, and the melanism usually extends partway up the legs in varying distances and intensities depending on the individual. The end of a masked palm civet's tail is sometimes darker than the majority of its coat. This difference in pigmentation can vary from a few shades darker than its coat to solid black and can cover a fourth to half of the tail. The main body varies from 51 to 76 cm (20 to 28 in) in length, to which is added a tail of 51 to 63 cm (20 to 25 in). It weighs between 3.6 and 6 kg (8 and 13.2 lb).  Distribution and habitat  The masked palm civet is distributed from the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, especially the Himalayas, ranging eastwards across Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam to China, Borneo, Sumatra, Taiwan, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. It was introduced to Mainland Japan and Ryukyu Islands. It has been recorded in both evergreen and deciduous forest, and in disturbed habitat. It also inhabits fragmented forest habitats, albeit at reduced density. It is also found in Japan, where genetic studies indicate that it is an introduced species with multiple introductions over the centuries, at least two of which are from Taiwan.  Ecology and behaviour  The masked palm civet is a nocturnal solitary predator that is occasionally active during the day. It is partly arboreal.Lekagul, B. and McNeely, J. A. (1988). Mammals of Thailand. White Lotus Press, Bangkok, Thailand. When alarmed, the animal sprays a secretion from its anal gland against the predator. The spray is similar in function to that of a skunk, and its conspicuousness serves to deter other predators.  Feeding and diet  The masked palm civet is an omnivore feeding on rats and birds as well as on fruit such as figs, mangoes, bananas, and leaves. Scat analysis indicates that they also eat mollusks, arthropods, bark and to a lesser extent snakes and frogs. The composition of the diet varies between seasons and sites.Zhou, Y., Zhang, J., Slade, E., Zhang, L., Palomares, F., Chen, J., Wang, X. Zhang, S. (2008). Dietary shifts in relation to fruit availability among masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in central China. Journal of Mammalogy 89 (2): 435‚Äì447.  Reproduction  Masked palm civets are polyestrous and their mating behavior is promiscuous. There are two breeding seasons per year. The female bears up to four young. Masked palm civets are known to reach 15 years of age in captivity. Copulation in masked palm civets can last for more than 30 minutes. Upon completion of copulation, males leave a copulation plug in the female's vaginal tract. The young grow to the size of an adult in about three months.  Threats  Masked palm civet - Kaeng Krachan National Park The major threats for the masked palm civet are continued habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat. It is widely offered in restaurants in southern China and is also eaten in Vietnam. Conservation Paguma larvata is protected in Malaysia and China, but not Thailand and Nepal. The population of India is listed on CITES Appendix III.  Connection with SARS  In May 2003, the SARS virus was isolated in several masked palm civets found in a wildlife market in Guangdong, China. Evidence of virus infection was also detected in other animals including a raccoon dog, and in humans working at the same market. In 2006, scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of the University of Hong Kong and the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention established a direct genetic link between the SARS coronavirus appearing in civets and humans, bearing out claims that the disease had jumped across species.Qiu Quanlin (2006). Scientists prove SARS-civet cat link.

The Denver Department of Environmental Health (DEH), a Denver government agency, manages and oversees the operating agreement to contract with Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) to provide services related to the medical investigations and medical services for disease control (including clinics) and the administration of vital birth and death records. DEH and Denver Public Health work together to conduct communicable disease reporting, investigation, and control for Denver. Public and environmental health functions and regulatory authority remains with DEH. DHHA provides communicable disease surveillance and medically oriented public health functions through their Denver Public Health (DPH) department. Through grant-funded programs, DPH conducts research on infectious diseases, including hepatitis surveillance; tuberculosis clinical trials; HIV/AIDS prevention, counseling, testing and treatment; and vaccine trials. DHHA's Denver Health Paramedic Division, a hospital based paramedic service, is based out of Denver Health.

Codified at Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.) ¬ß¬ß 25-29-101 et seq. and transitioned from the Denver Department of Health and Hospitals to an independent authority in 1997. The DHHA is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors, who are appointed for five years by the Mayor of Denver and confirmed by the Denver City Council.C.R.S. ¬ß 25-29-103 History Denver General was established in 1860. The hospital was founded near 11th and Wazee, but in 1873, a new medical center was built at the corner of 6th Avenue and Cherokee; this is where Denver Health is located to this day. The hospital was well known for founding the first nursing school west of the Mississippi and for being one of the earliest facilities for treating Tuberculosis. The hospital employed many health care visionaries, including Florence Sabin who was instrumental in creating a functional Public Health department. In 1989 a book was written about The Denver General emergency room, The Knife and Gun Club, Scenes from an Emergency Room by photographer Eugene Richards which received an Award of Excellence from the American College of Emergency Physicians. The book is a collection of stories taken from the emergency department and ambulances. The emergency room of Denver Health gained the nickname \\"Knife and Gun Club\\" due to the frequency of knife and gun related injuries. On January 1, 1997, Denver General became a political subdivision of the state, and was renamed Denver Health and Hospital Authority.

Yefim Fyodorovich Karskiy (, ; , older name form) (1 January 1861 (20 December 1860) - 29 April 1931) was a Belarusian-Russian linguist-Slavist, ethnographer and paleographer, founder of Belarusian linguistics, literary studies and paleography, a member of numerous scientific institutions, and author of more than 100 works on linguistics, ethnography, paleography and others. Karskiy was described by his contemporaries as extremely industrious, accurate, self-organized, and reserved in behavior. He was acclaimed as a scientist of the highest integrity.[KUC 2006] pp. 15, 19‚Äì23. E.g., noted by A. Tsvikyevich. Karskiy's input into contemporary Slavistics, especially into the Belarusian branch, was immense. The first significant revisions of Karskiy's views on the development of the Church Slavonic and Russian languages were proposed much later, by Viktor Vinogradov. One of the best known works of Karskiy is Belarusians.  Biography   Early life and education  Yefim Karskiy was born in Lasha (in Grodno Governorate, now Hrodna Voblast), to the family of teacher F. Novitskiy and Orthodox deacon's daughter M. Novitskaya. Initially, he bore the family name of his mother, Novitskiy. With his family, he spent his childhood years in Navahrudak and Minsk regions of Belarus. He studied in Folk School () at Yatra, (Navahrudak uyezd) during the 1870s, and in 1874 enrolled in the Minsk Ecclesiastical School, where he joined the Seminary. Around 1881 he became interested in ethnography, and left his ecclesiastical studies to join the Nezhin historical-philological institute. His first philological research paper was published in 1883 in the Russian Philological Courier. Karskiy graduated from the Nezhin historical-philological institute in 1885 in the field of Russian and Slavonic philology. Observing the absence of scientific analysis of the Belarusian language, he published his first major scientific work Review of Sounds and Forms of Belarusian Language in 1886. Upon his graduation he taught Russian and Church Slavonic languages and Russian literature in the Vil‚Äôna Liceum No.2 in Vilnius, where he also served as the secretary and as elected member of the Resources Committee. He passed his magisterial examination in 1891, and in 1893 left the Liceum and began teaching Russian language in Warsaw University. During his tenure there he also taught Slavonic paleography, Russian dialectology, and Church Slavonic grammar. He would defended his magisterial thesis To the history of sounds and forms of the Belarusian talk at Kiev University, which was the first published academic dissertation concerned with the Belarusian language. He would continue his studies of the Belarusian language, and in 1898 he began studying the local dialects of the Belarusian people, both by the literary artifacts and by ethnographic tours to the Grodno, Vil‚Äôna, Minsk regions, among others. In 1901 Karskiy became an associated member of Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, department of Russian language and literacy.  Later career  From 1905 to 1910 Karskiy served two terms as the rector of Warsaw University. After the end of his second term in 1910, he refused to remain at the position in protest of the policies of Imperial Minister of Education Lev Kasso. He moved to Petrograd in 1916 and became a member of Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, with specialization in ethnography and linguistics. He taught at Petrograd Imperial University, and was a founder member of the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia. In 1918, forced by the economic ruin in Petrograd from World War I and the October Revolution, Karskiy moved to Minsk. He was given tenure at Minsk Pedagogical Institute, but was dismissed from his position the following year, shortly before being arrested by the Extraordinary Commission.Proceedings of General Meeting of Russian Academy of Sciences on May 5, 1919, ¬ß141 He was not held for long, and that same year moved back to Petrograd. He resumed his teaching at Petrograd University, staying through its rechristening as Leningrad University in 1924. He also returned to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences (at that point the Academy of Sciences of the USSR) where he became Head of the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography. In 1922 he donated his personal library to the newly created Belarusian State University. Beginning in 1926 he made scientific visits to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. His reports from these visits were highly appreciated by the USSR Academy of Sciences, but they began to have political repercussions for him. He began to butt heads with the leadership of the Academy, and in 1927 he became the target of a sharp political critique in the newspapers \\"Zvyazda\\" (Myensk) and \\"Pravda\\" (Moscow). His membership in the USSR Academy of Sciences was put under question, and despite enjoying a certain amount of political patronage he wasn't given the room in the press to defend himself. In 1929, he was elected for the member of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The following year, however, he was abruptly removed from the position of the Director of the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in Leningrad. For his teaching and research activities, Karskiy was given the civil rank of \\"real state‚Äôs counselor\\" (?). He was decorated with orders of St. Stanislaus III grade (1889) and II grade (1899), St. Anna III grade (1895) and II grade (1903), St. Vladimir IV grade (1911), various medals. In recognition of his research on the Belarusian ethnography, he was awarded the Great Golden Medal of the Russian Geographical Society (1894), the Golden Medals of Batyushkov of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1898, 1902), Minor Lomonosov Prize of Russian Academy of Sciences (1901), Batyushkov Academical Prize (1910), and Akhmatov Academical Prize (1913). In 1964, a memorial for Karski was opened at the Lasha School. Works Belarusians, 1903 Karskiy was the author of at least 100 significant scientific works. Some of the major ones are listed below.

Plot Chasing the Horizon takes a look at a team's preparation for the Tecate SCORE Baja 1000, one of the most grueling off-road racing events in the world. It is known as such because of the extreme conditions which the race is set in, the length of the race, and spectators have even been known to set up booby traps on the course for their own entertainment. The team that the film takes a look at is a rookie trio called Team Horizon. Milo Brown is an ex-con and junkyard owner but is also the team's captain. Jeff Lloyd was once a homeless man who went on to become a millionaire and racecar driver. Toby O'Mara serves as the team chief mechanic and co-driver, but he is also a plumber. The three men come together and form a sort of dysfunctional family to compete in this grand event. The film takes a look at the ups and downs of the crew's experiences in the days that lead up to the actual race and the viewer sees moments of laughter and comedy but also times of sadness.

During his tenure in Canton, Ruan is estimated to have earned more than 195,000 taels of silver. He was widely recognized as an official, scholar, and patron of learning both by his contemporaries and by modern scholars. He was also praised as an honest official and an exemplary man of the ‚ÄòConfucian persuasion‚Äô. His name is mentioned in almost all works on Qing history or Chinese classics because of the wide range of his research and publications. A number of these publications are still reprinted. Ruan Yuan was a follower of the Han Learning tradition and as such, with the encouragement of Liu Fenglu, he edited and organized publication of the compendium of the imperial achievements in kaozheng scholarship, the Huang Qing Jingjie (:zh:ÁöáÊ∏ÖÁªèËß£) published in 1829.

It was founded in 1970 by Judith E. Heumann and her friends Denise McQuade, Bobbi Linn, Frieda Tankas, Fred Francis, Pat Figueroa, possibly Larry Weissberger, Susan Marcus, Jimmy Lynch and Roni Stier (all of whom were disabled). Heumann had met some of the others at Camp Jened, a camp for children with disabilities. Disabled In Action is a democratic, not-for-profit, tax-exempt, membership organization. Disabled In Action consists primarily of and is directed by people with disabilities. As stated on its website, the organization aims to \\"fight to eliminate the barriers that prevent [people with disabilities] from enjoying full equality in American society.\\" DIA believes in the motto, \\"Nothing about us without us!\\" The organization meets monthly in New York City and publishes a newsletter, in print and online, called The DIA ACTIVIST. Disabled In Action, along with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, is involved with The One Step Campaign, a coalition of disability, advocacy and service organizations. The campaign encourages stores, restaurants and other places of public accommodation in the New York City area to provide wheelchair accessibility. History Disabled in Action was founded in 1970 by Judith E. Heumann and her friends Denise McQuade, Bobbi Linn, Frieda Tankas, Fred Francis, Pat Figueroa, possibly Larry Weissberger, Susan Marcus, Jimmy Lynch and Roni Stier (all of whom were disabled). Heumann had met some of the others at Camp Jened, a camp for children with disabilities. According to Heumann, the organization was originally called \\"Handicapped in Action\\". She disliked that name and lobbied to change it. Heumann explained, \\"How could we, as a new organization, be calling ourselves 'Handicapped in Action'?\\" As a result, the name of the organization was changed to Disabled in Action. Early versions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were vetoed by President Richard Nixon in October 1972 and March 1973. In 1972, DIA demonstrated in New York City with a sit-in protesting one of the vetoes. Led by Heumann, eighty activists staged this sit-in on Madison Avenue, stopping traffic. In 1972 demonstrations were also held by disabled activists in Washington, D.C. to protest this veto; among the demonstrators were DIA, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Paraplegia Foundation, and others. In 1976, DIA picketed the United Cerebral Palsy telethon, calling telethons ‚Äúdemeaning and paternalistic shows which celebrate and encourage pity.‚Äù In the late 1970s, some Disabled In Action members formed a musical group called The DIA Singers, which recorded two albums, In Motion and ...and the Parking Spots Are Nothing But The Best. On April 19, 2006, it was announced that after nearly 5 years, Duane Reade, a chain of drugstores primarily located in New York City, finally agreed to settle with Disabled In Action to make all of its stores ADA-compliant. According to the New York Daily News, Duane Reade estimated it would take two years to inspect and revamp its stores for wheelchair access. NBC's original The More You Know logo is very similar to the DIA's logo. The DIA had considered legal action against NBC for copyright infringement, but has subsided those claims since the logo was changed.

Both were published by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1931.Andrei Kolmogorov, \\"√úber die analytischen Methoden in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung\\" (On Analytical Methods in the Theory of Probability), 1931, Later it was realized that the forward equation was already known to physicists under the name Fokker-Planck equation; the KBE on the other hand was new. Informally, the Kolmogorov forward equation addresses the following problem. We have information about the state x of the system at time t (namely a probability distribution p_t(x)); we want to know the probability distribution of the state at a later time s>t. The adjective 'forward' refers to the fact that p_t(x) serves as the initial condition and the PDE is integrated forward in time (in the common case where the initial state is known exactly, p_t(x) is a Dirac delta function centered on the known initial state). The Kolmogorov backward equation on the other hand is useful when we are interested at time t in whether at a future time s the system will be in a given subset of states B, sometimes called the target set. The target is described by a given function u_s(x) which is equal to 1 if state x is in the target set at time s, and zero otherwise. In other words, u_s(x) = 1_B , the indicator function for the set B. We want to know for every state x at time t, (t what is the probability of ending up in the target set at time s (sometimes called the hit probability). In this case u_s(x) serves as the final condition of the PDE, which is integrated backward in time, from s to t. Formulating the Kolmogorov backward equation Assume that the system state X_t evolves according to the stochastic differential equation :dX_t = \\\\mu(X_t,t)\\\\,dt + \\\\sigma(X_t,t)\\\\,dW_t then the Kolmogorov backward equation is as follows Risken, H., \\"The Fokker-Planck equation: Methods of solution and applications\\" 1996, Springer :-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}p(x,t)=\\\\mu(x,t)\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}p(x,t) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2(x,t)\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^{2}}p(x,t) for t\\\\le s, subject to the final condition p(x,s)=u_s(x). This can be derived using It≈ç's lemma on p(x,t) and setting the dt term equal to zero. This equation can also be derived from the Feynman-Kac formula by noting that the hit probability is the same as the expected value of u_s(x) over all paths that originate from state x at time t: : P(X_s \\\\in B \\\\mid X_t = x) = E[u_s(x) \\\\mid X_t = x] Historically, of course, the KBE was developed before the Feynman- Kac formula (1949). Formulating the Kolmogorov forward equation With the same notation as before, the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equation is: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s}p(x,s)=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}[\\\\mu(x,s)p(x,s)] + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}[\\\\sigma^2(x,s)p(x,s)] for s \\\\ge t, with initial condition p(x,t)=p_t(x).

Moritz was a young scholar and Anglophile traveling to England for the first time. His journey was approximately two months during June and July 1782 and began in London where he saw famous sights, attended the theater and watched sessions of Parliament. He then set out on foot for Richmond, stopping at Oxford, Derby, Leicester, Peak Cavern and Northampton and back to London. The book was written as a series of letters to Moritz's friend at home and is in two equal parts, the first in London, the second walking about. The first edition was published in Germany in 1783 with a second improved edition in 1785. In 1795 an English translation of the second edition was published as Travels, chiefly on Foot, through several parts of England in 1782, described in Letters to a Friend. It contained many errors and was attributed to the daughter of Charles Godfrey Woide (1725‚Äì1790), who himself is described in Chapter 5 \\"Information and entertainment\\". Despite its flaws, it became the standard translation of the 19th and early 20th centuries. A new translation was published in 1965 by Reginald Nettel and is now the standard English edition. It was republished by Eland As Journeys of a German in England: A Walking Tour of England in 1782 (1983, new edition 2009). In deciding to complete his journey on foot, Moritz was met with a rude reception. The Inclosure Acts had forced England's peasants to become employees of land- owners, and those who could not find employment became the \\"wandering poor\\" ‚Äì thus anyone seen walking along the road was identified as a beggar or a thief. For this reason, Moritz experienced considerable problems finding room and board, and was even run out of some villages, simply for arriving into town on foot. Sources *Reginald Nettel, trans.

Similar to the way VITC timecode is embedded in the vertical interval area of a video signal, CTL timecode embeds SMPTE timecode in the control track area of helical scan video recordings. The advantage of both VITC and CTL timecode is that a precious audio track does not have to be sacrificed for linear timecode. Though a very effective technology, and still probably in limited use today, CTL timecode never really caught on. JVC is apparently the only manufacturer that included CTL timecode capability in their video products, and this was limited to select professional S-VHS equipment. When it was introduced, there was a lot of undeserved negativity about CTL timecode, because people misunderstood how it worked. Many incorrectly assumed that CTL timecode was nothing more than a control track pulse signal. The only real problem with CTL timecode was that JVC chose to call it \\"CTL timecode\\". Control Track Pulse: Most are familiar with the digital \\"counters\\" on VHS recorders and camcorders, viewed via the onscreen display (OSD) and/or a dedicated LED display. These numbers are sometimes in real time format (hours:minutes:seconds), but are often only an ambiguous 4 digit sequential counter. These numbers advance up or down based on the machine counting a tape's control track pulses. This type of display is useful only as a simple and temporary reference, as it is very inaccurate, and the counter is reset to zero when a tape is inserted. A basic 4 digit counter is almost completely worthless, as their rate of advance was never standardized by manufacturers. Conversely, CTL timecode is an absolute timecode with specific digital references for every frame of video. Thus, a tape with CTL timecode can always display current timecode position accurately, even if the tape is moved from one machine to another. CTL timecode embedding can be transferred when making a copy, as long as the recording machine supports CTL timecode. Because CTL timecode is SMPTE timecode, its timecode can be interchanged with other SMPTE timecode schemes, like VITC and LTC (linear, audio track) timecode, as well as SMPTE timecode devices like timecode readers, generators, window dub inserters, MIDI synchronizers, and edit controllers. CTL timecode is vulnerable to any gaps or problems in a tape's control track, but so is LTC and VITC timecode. The acronym LOCT (pronounced locked), used by many video professionals, can mean \\"Loss Of Control Track\\", and/or \\"Loss Of Continuous Timecode\\".

It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its distribution is severely fragmented, and the extent and quality of its habitat in Sri Lanka's hill regions are declining. The golden palm civet was described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1778. Taxonomy Viverra zeylonensis was the scientific name proposed by Pallas in 1778 for a palm civet specimen from Sri Lanka. It was placed in the genus Paradoxurus by Edward Frederick Kelaart in 1852, who also described a fulvous brown palm civet from the mountains of Sri Lanka. He considered this specimen a variety of the golden palm civet and proposed the scientific name Paradoxurus montanus. Since zoological specimens exhibit polymorphism, it was suggested to split the golden palm civet into distinct species in 2009: * the Sri Lankan brown palm civet Paradoxurus montanus * the golden wet-zone palm civet Paradoxurus aureus * the golden dry-zone palm civet Paradoxurus stenocephalus Genetic analysis indicates that specimens of P. montanus, P. aureus and P. stenocephalus share the same haplotype. Because of their low genetic difference, they should neither be considered distinct species nor subspecies, but junior synonyms of the golden palm civet.  Characteristics  The golden palm civet is brown on the upper side, but individually variable from dark sepia to ochreous, rusty or golden-brown. The tips of the contour hairs are frequently lustrous, sometimes greyish. The legs are about the same tint as the back, but the tail and the face are sometimes noticeably paler, buffy-grey. The face does not have a pattern, and the vibrissae are dirty white. The hair in front of the shoulders radiates from two whorls and grows forward along the sides of the neck and the nape to the head. It also grows forward on the fore throat, radiating from a single whorl. The dorsal pattern consists of faint bands and spots that are slightly darker than the ground colour. The lower side is slightly paler and sometimes greyer than the upper. The golden palm civet has two morphs ‚Äî one golden and one dark brown.  Distribution and habitat  The golden palm civet is found in lowland rain forest, evergreen mountain forests, and also dense monsoon forest.Schreiber, A., Wirth, R., Riffel, M. and Van Rompaey, H. (1989). Weasels, civets, mongooses, and their relatives. An Action Plan for the conservation of mustelids and viverrids. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.  Ecology and behaviour  The golden palm civet is forest-dependent, yet tolerant of minor habitat modification where some continuous forest remains. It is arboreal, nocturnal, and solitary; its diet consists of fruits, berries, invertebrates, and a wide range of small vertebrates. In culture In Sri Lanka the golden palm civet is called , , or / , by the Sinhala speaking community. Both golden and Asian palm civet are sometimes collectively called in Sinhala and maranai (‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç) in Tamil.

It may help with incontinence, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency. Benefits appear similar to other medications in the class. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection. Severe side effects may include urinary retention, QT prolongation, hallucinations, glaucoma, and anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. It is of the antimuscarinic class and works by decreasing bladder contractions. Solifenacin was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. A month's supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£27.62 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$370. In 2017, it was the 283rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical use It is used to treat overactive bladder. It may help with incontinence, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency. Benefits appear similar to other antimuscarinics such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, and darifenacin. It is also used to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), a form of bladder dysfunction related to neurological impairment, in children ages two years and older. NDO is a dysfunction of the bladder that results from disease or injury in the nervous system. NDO may be related to congenital conditions (often-inherited conditions beginning at or before birth), such as spina bifida (myelomeningocele), or other conditions such as spinal cord injury. With NDO, there is overactivity of the bladder wall muscle, which normally relaxes to allow storage of urine. The bladder wall muscle overactivity results in sporadic bladder muscle contraction, which increases pressure in the bladder and decreases the volume of urine the bladder can hold. If NDO is not treated, increased pressure in the bladder can put the upper urinary tract at risk of harm, including possible permanent damage to the kidneys. In addition, spontaneous bladder muscle contractions can lead to unexpected and frequent leakage of urine with symptoms of urinary urgency (immediate urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than normal) and incontinence (loss of bladder control).  Contraindications  Solifenacin is contraindicated for people with urinary retention, gastric retention, uncontrolled or poorly controlled closed-angle glaucoma, severe liver disease (Child-Pugh class C), and hemodialysis. Long QT syndrome is not a contraindication although solifenacin, like tolterodine and darifenacin, binds to hERG channels of the heart and may prolong the QT interval. This mechanism appears to be seldom clinically relevant. Solifenacin is not to be used in people with gastric retention (reduced emptying of the stomach), uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma (fluid buildup in the eye which raises eye pressure) or hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to solifenacin or any of its components. Solifenacin is also not recommended for use in people with severe liver failure, clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction in the absence of clean intermittent catheterization, decreased gastrointestinal motility (slowed intestinal contractions), or at high risk of QT prolongation (an electrical disturbance where the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats), including people with a known history of QT prolongation and people taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.  Side effects  The most common side effects of solifenacin are dry mouth, constipation and urinary tract infection. As all anticholinergics, solifenacin may rarely cause hyperthermia due to decreased perspiration. Somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness) has been reported. Severe allergic reactions, such as angioedema (swelling beneath the skin) and anaphylaxis, have been reported in people treated with solifenacin succinate and may be life-threatening.  Interactions  Solifenacin is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. When administered concomitantly with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, the metabolism of solifenacin is impaired, leading to an increase in its concentration in the body and a reduction in its excretion. As stated above, solifenacin may also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, administering it concomitantly with drugs which also have this effect, such as moxifloxacin or pimozide, can theoretically increase the risk of arrhythmia.  Pharmacology   Mechanism of action  Solifenacin is a competitive cholinergic receptor antagonist, selective for the M3 receptor subtype. The binding of acetylcholine to these receptors, particularly M3, plays a critical role in the contraction of smooth muscle. By preventing the binding of acetylcholine to these receptors, solifenacin reduces smooth muscle tone in the bladder, allowing the bladder to retain larger volumes of urine and reducing the number of micturition, urgency and incontinence episodes. Because of a long elimination half life, a once-a-day dose can offer 24-hour control of the urinary bladder smooth muscle tone.  Pharmacokinetics  Peak plasma concentrations are reached three to eight hours after absorption from the gut. In the bloodstream, 98% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, mainly acidic ones. Metabolism is mediated by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and possibly others. There is one known active metabolite, 4R-hydroxysolifenacin, and three inactive ones, the N-glucuronide, the N-oxide and the 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide. The elimination half-life is 45 to 68 hours. 69% of the substance, both in its original form and as metabolites, are excreted renally and 23% via the feces.  Chemistry  Atropine for comparison Like other anticholinergics, solifenacin is an ester of a carboxylic acid containing (at least) an aromatic ring with an alcohol containing a nitrogen atom. While in the prototype anticholinergic atropine the bicyclic ring is tropane, solifenacin replaces it with quinuclidine. The free base is a yellow oil, while the salt solifenacin succinate forms yellowish crystals.  History  The compound was studied using animal models by the Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan. It was known as YM905 when under study in the early 2000s. Solifenacin was approved for medical used in the United States in 2004 with an indication to treat overactive bladder in adults 18 years and older. In May 2020, solifenacin was approved for medical use in the United States with an indication to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), a form of bladder dysfunction related to neurological impairment, in children ages two years and older. The efficacy of solifenacin to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) was established in two clinical trials with a total of 95 pediatric NDO participants, ages two to 17 years old. The studies were designed to measure (as a primary efficacy endpoint) the maximum amount of urine the bladder could hold after 24 weeks of treatment. In the first study, 17 participants ages two to less than five years old were able to hold an average of 39 mL more urine than when the study began. In the second study, 49 participants ages five to 17 years were able to hold an average of 57 mL more urine than when the study began. Reductions in spontaneous bladder contractions, bladder pressure and number of incontinence episodes were also observed in both studies. The approval of Vesicare LS was granted to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.  Society and culture  The INN is solifenacin. It is manufactured and marketed by Astellas, GlaxoSmithKline and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.  Cost  A 2006 cost-effectiveness study found that 5 mg solifenacin had the lowest cost and highest effectiveness among anticholinergic drugs used to treat overactive bladder in the United States, with an average medical cost per successfully treated patient of $6863 per year. By 2019, with the introduction of generics, the retail cost of a month's supply was down to $20 in the US.

It originally aired on Fox on September 24, 2006. The episode follows teenage daughter Meg after she requests that her parents buy her a car. At the showroom, however, her father, Peter, decides to buy a tank, instead of the car Meg was interested in. Deciding to pay for a new car herself, Meg is able to get a job at Superstore USA, which eventually destroys the local economy of Quahog, and upsets the local community, leading Brian Griffin and Stewie to save the day. The episode was written by Kirker Butler and directed by Dan Povenmire. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and entertaining cultural references. It was viewed by 9.66 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Dave Boat, Carrie Fisher, Phil LaMarr, Rachael MacFarlane, and Fred Tatasciore, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\" was released on DVD along with twelve other episodes from the season on September 18, 2007. Plot Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire are spending the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded to pick up Meg from the roller skating rink. They then go to the rink and continue to enjoy themselves, while skating. The guys forget to pick up Meg when they leave. After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car dealership, where she shows an interest in a sedan. Distracted by a large tank at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, and is able to get a job at the local Quahog megastore, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon go bankrupt because of the new superstore, and causes people to lose their jobs. Meanwhile, Peter loses his job at the Pawtucket Brewery because Superstore USA has its own brewery and they can't compete with them. Back at the house, Brian, Chris, and Peter watch TV and on the news, Tom says that Quahog is suffering a heat wave across the city, with Superstore USA taking away the neighborhood power to power their cooling system. Disjointed, Peter joins an angry protest outside the store, but after entering the store to encourage customers to leave, Peter is impressed by its central cooling system, and decides to become an employee also working under Mr. Penisburg, with Meg as his superior. Later, Meg is promoted to assistant manager by Mr. Penisburg, who immediately instructs her to fire Peter. Despite her reservations about her father, she chooses her family over her job and quits. In the meantime, Brian and Stewie decide to destroy the superstore completely by retrieving Peter's tank, and driving it through the superstore, while Peter and Meg escape through an emergency exit. After bulldozing the store, Brian and Stewie drive outside and demolish it with the tank's cannon, killing Penisburg in the process. Immediately afterwards, the electricity supply to Quahog is restored, and life returns to normal. Production Kirker Butler wrote the episode. The episode was written by Kirker Butler and directed by Dan Povenmire. Several variations were made to the Iceman scene, who was originally meant to be fighting with his wife, but was changed for legal reasons. Several scenes and gags had to be removed from the television broadcast of the episode, as they were deemed inappropriate. This includes a scene when Brian recalls being stroked too hard by a \\"Special Child,\\" in which he retaliates by biting the child's hand. The final scene, also censored from television airing, involved Chris laughing excessively at one of his own jokes, concluding with \\"Oh, I peed and pooped.\\" These scenes were removed from FOX, but not from Adult Swim or the Volume Five DVD. Another scene involves a man driving in a Hummer, while watching the 2005 film Madagascar in his car. The man then exclaims \\"Dude, those animals are so fucking funny,\\" which was mistakenly broadcast uncensored in Canada, though this problem was corrected for future broadcasts. The censors remained intact in the United States. \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\", along with the twelve other episodes from Family Guys fifth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on September 18, 2007. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discusses the process behind drawing Peter Griffin, and mini-feature entitled \\"Toys, Toys Galore\\". In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Dave Boat, actress Carrie Fisher, voice actor Phil LaMarr, voice actress Rachael MacFarlane and voice actor Fred Tatasciore guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, actress Alex Breckenridge, actor Johnny Brennan, actor Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Cultural references The title of the episode parodies the title of the 1988 cult film, Hell Comes to Frogtown. In the opening scene of the episode, Peter, Joe, Quagmire and Cleveland are shown playing ping pong at the local bar. Once Joe accidentally hits their final ping pong ball out a window, Peter responds by forcing the puppet character Mr. Moose, from the children's television series Captain Kangaroo, to tell a knock-knock joke. This causes hundreds of ping pong balls to cascade from the ceiling above them. Going on to exclaim the amount of fun he is having, Peter recounts his performance in a Broadway musical version of the 1984 film Red Dawn. After being reminded to pick up Meg at the local roller rink, Peter and his friends decide to go skating. At the roller rink scene, the 1976 disco song \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\" is featured, performed by Walter Murphy. This is a tongue-in-cheek gag, as Murphy is also one of the composers for Family Guy. After returning home without Meg, the Griffin family are shown watching a Pepperidge Farm commercial on their television. Immediately afterwards, Meg enters her home, and begs her parents to get buy her a new vehicle. Reluctant to do so, Peter informs Meg that plenty of people are able to get around without a car, including the fictional Marvel Comics superhero Iceman. Finally deciding to give in and purchase a vehicle for Meg, the Griffin family head to the local car dealership. While there, Brian notices a large amount of Hummers, and questions who would ever want to drive one. A cutaway then shows a loud, obnoxious man driving a yellow Hummer, who goes on to brag about being able to watch the 2005 film Madagascar while driving, and proceeds to destroy two vehicles in the process while yelling the name of former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Returning home with the tank, Peter decides to surprise his wife, Lois, with his new purchase. Once Lois opens her eyes, she exclaims the phrase \\"Bocce balls!\\", which was originally from the 1984 comedy film Splash. Coming to accept the tank, Lois and Peter decide to take it to a drive-in theater, where they are shown watching a film entitled The Even Couple, by screenwriter Neil Simon, and starring actors Jeff Daniels and Bill Pullman. The next day, after the tank is impounded by Joe, the family is shown watching the CBS television drama Ghost Whisperer, with Jennifer Love Hewitt then appearing on screen. Meg then interrupts, and expresses her anger at her father for allowing the tank to be impounded. Her father then responds by stating that it is \\"not the worst thing\\" he has ever done, with a cutaway of Peter murdering Yogi Bear then being shown. The Superstore USA store is similar to Wal-Mart. Frustrated by her father, Meg decides to get a job at Superstore USA. As she is being instructed about her job by her new boss, he tells her to feed the deformed man Sloth from the 1985 film The Goonies. As Superstore USA begins to take over the town, it is announced that rolling blackouts will be performed in order to meet the store's need for electricity. A commercial during Quahog's local news is then played, parodying the theme to the 1971 children's television series The Electric Company. While Stewie and Brian attack the store, the manager of Superstore USA runs to hide in the bathroom before being crushed by the billboard in front of him. This is a reference to the Jurassic Park scene where the attorney also hides in a bathroom before being eaten by the T-Rex. In addition, the music that is played when Brian and Stewie are destroying the store follows the style of Elmer Bernstein's theme to Stripes. Reception In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode brought in 9.66 million viewers on its original airing, according to the Nielsen ratings. The episode acquired a 3.4 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, tying with The Simpsons, and edging out series creator Seth MacFarlane's second show American Dad!, in both ratings and total viewership. Reviews of the episode by television critics were mostly positive, noting its \\"hilarious beginning and the nice ending.\\" Dan Iverson of IGN praised the episode, stating that the episode \\"looks to show that this fifth season is going to bring the series back to the irreverent basics that made it so appealing.\\" Iverson went on to comment that some of the jokes were \\"extremely funny\\" and that \\"the episode had it all, from the Electric Company bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar.\\" In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, \\"Stewie Loves Lois\\" and \\"Mother Tucker\\", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode \\"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\\". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, \\"it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter. Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it just gets annoying.\\" References External links  Family Guy (season 5) episodes 2006 American television episodes ","title":"Hell Comes to Quahog"},{"id":"6419517","text":"Trospium chloride is used to treat overactive bladder.UK eMC Regurin XL 60mg Last updated July 3, 2015 It has side effects typical of drugs like it, namely dry mouth, stomach upset, and constipation; these side effects cause problems with people taking their medicine as directed. However it doesn't cause central nervous system side effects like other drugs of its class. It is pregnancy category C and is excreted somewhat in breast milk.FDA Trospium chloride label Last updated January 2011 Chemically it is a quaternary ammonium cation which causes it to stay in periphery rather than crossing the blood-brain barrier. It works by causing the smooth muscle in the bladder to relax. It was patented in 1966 and approved for medical use in 1974. It was first approved in the US in 2004, and an extended release version with once- daily dosing was brought to market in 2007. It became generic in Europe in 2009 and in the US the first extended-release generic was approved in 2012.  Medical uses  Trospium chloride is used for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge incontinence and frequent urination. It shouldn't be used with people who retain urine, who have severe digestive conditions, myasthenia gravis, narrow-angle glaucoma, or tachyarrhythmia. It should be used in caution with people who have problems with their autonomous nervous system (dysautonomia) or who have gastroesophageal reflux disease, or in whom fast heart rates are undesirable, such as people with hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. Trospium chloride is rated Pregnancy Category C, as there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of trospium chloride in pregnant women and there were signs of harm to the fetus in animal studies. The drug was excreted somewhat in the milk of nursing mothers. The drug was studied in children.  Side effects  Side effects are typical of gastrointestinal effects of anticholinergic drugs, and include dry mouth, indigestion, and constipation. These side effects lead to problems with adherence, especially for older people. The only CNS side effect is headache, which was very rare. Tachycardia is a rare side effect.  Mechanism of action  Trospium chloride is a muscarinic antagonist. Trospium chloride blocks the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors organs that are responsive to the compounds, including the bladder. Its parasympatholytic action relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder. Receptor assays showed that trospium chloride has negligible affinity for nicotinic receptors as compared to muscarinic receptors at concentrations obtained from therapeutic doses.  Pharmacokinetics  After oral administration, less than 10% of the dose is absorbed. Mean absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose is 9.6% (range: 4.0 to 16.1%). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur between 5 and 6 hours post-dose. Mean Cmax increases greater than dose-proportionally; a 3-fold and 4-fold increase in Cmax was observed for dose increases from 20 mg to 40 mg and from 20 mg to 60 mg, respectively. AUC exhibits dose linearity for single doses up to 60 mg. Trospium chloride exhibits diurnal variability in exposure with a decrease in Cmax and AUC of up to 59% and 33%, respectively, for evening relative to morning doses. Administration with a high fat meal resulted in reduced absorption, with AUC and Cmax values 70 to 80% lower than those obtained when trospium chloride was administered while fasting. Therefore, it is recommended that trospium chloride should be taken at least one hour prior to meals or on an empty stomach. Protein binding ranged from 50 to 85% when concentration levels of trospium chloride (0.5 to 50 ng/mL) were incubated with human serum in vitro. The 3H-trospium chloride ratio of plasma to whole blood was 1.6:1. This ratio indicates that the majority of 3H-trospium chloride is distributed in plasma. The apparent volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is 395 (¬± 140) liters. The metabolic pathway of trospium in humans has not been fully defined. Of the 10% of the dose absorbed, metabolites account for approximately 40% of the excreted dose following oral administration. The major metabolic pathway is hypothesized as ester hydrolysis with subsequent conjugation of benzylic acid to form azoniaspironortropanol with glucuronic acid. Cytochrome P450 is not expected to contribute significantly to the elimination of trospium. Data taken from in vitro human liver microsomes investigating the inhibitory effect of trospium on seven cytochrome P450 isoenzyme substrates (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) suggest a lack of inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations. The plasma half-life for trospium chloride following oral administration is approximately 20 hours. After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation of 14C-trospium chloride, the majority of the dose (85.2%) was recovered in feces and a smaller amount (5.8% of the dose) was recovered in urine; 60% of the radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged trospium. The mean renal clearance for trospium (29 L/hour) is 4-fold higher than average glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion is a major route of elimination for trospium. There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated. Chemical properties Anticholinergic drugs used to treat overactive bladder were all amines as of 2003. Quaternary ammonium cations in general are more hydrophilic than other amines and don't cross membranes well, so they tend to be poorly absorbed from the digestive system, and to not cross the blood-brain barrier. Oxybutynin, tolterodine, darifenacin, and solifenacin are tertiary amines while trospium chloride and propantheline are quaternary amines.

Speciality and Madaus sued and initially won based on the argument that 90% of prescriptions were already generic, but Doncaster appealed and won the appeal based on the argument that it could not charge a premium with a generic label.

The episode originally broadcast on November 5, 2006. The episode follows Stewie and Brian after they unintentionally join the United States Army, and end up leaving to serve in Iraq, only to return home when the war ends. Meanwhile, Chris joins a heavy metal band, and develops an anti-social attitude, which requires Marilyn Manson to intervene.Saving Private Brian British Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 2007-12-04 The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Cyndi Tang. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.45 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Gary Cole, Louis Gossett, Jr., Juanita Jennings, Phil LaMarr, Samm Levine, Rachael MacFarlane, Denis Martel, Enn Reitel, Stacey Scowley, Fred Tatasciore and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot A U.S. Army recruitment officer comes to the high school to hold an assembly and entices the students with a glamorized, deceptive video presentation, which impresses every one including Chris. Chris returns home and tells the family during dinner that he wants to enlist, but Lois attempts to dissuade him, for the military is not a place for him. The next day, while driving Stewie to Gymboree Play & Music for parachute day, Brian decides to take a detour to the recruitment office to scold the recruiting officer for trying to trick Chris through devious means. The two arrive at the office but the wait is long; when Brian goes to top-up the parking meter Stewie walks into the office. Stewie ends up enlisting in the Army and signs Brian up as well when told there \\"is a $100 bonus for signing up a buddy.\\" Brian returns and is shocked. Brian and Stewie begin basic training, but Brian becomes stressed from the discipline and decides one night to leave. Stewie wakes up and finds Brian packing his suitcase, but he manages to talk him out of leaving, insisting that he had never finished anything significant in his life and that the Army will provide him the discipline. With this, Brian decides to stay. After they complete their training, Stewie and Brian are deployed to Iraq. Meantime, the two are patrolling the streets of a village, commenting on the \\"good situation so far\\"; however, after the pair get caught up in a terrorist attack, they become dissuaded and decide to find a way to get out of the Army. They first attempt to be discharged by pretending to be homosexual (only to discover that one of their superiors is gay). As a last resort, they attempt to get \\"Wounded in Action\\" by shooting each other in the foot; they do this only to find out that the Army now takes anyone no matter what, going so far as to allow two corpses to guard the ammunition. They are then told that democracy has kicked in and the war is over, thus meaning all the soldiers can return to the United States. Meanwhile, to distract Chris from the Army, Peter takes him to look at extracurricular activities at his school, where he is accepted into a heavy metal band. Chris develops a rebellious and rude attitude after joining the band, and he significantly changes his appearance. Peter and Lois, worried about his behavior, search his room to find the cause of his behavioral change; Lois becomes convinced it is a result of listening to the violent lyrics from his music. In addition, they find a poster shrine to Marilyn Manson in his closet, and become convinced that his music corrupted their son. They decide to track down Manson and find him at the Grammys Music Awards. When they find Manson, Peter punches him in the face and Lois accuses him for destroying their son with his songs. Manson, played by writer Tom Devanney, laughing at \\"this old thing again\\", offers to help them with Chris. Manson returns to the Griffin house with Peter and Lois, where he tells Chris and his bandmates that it is important to respect and obey their parents, and in addition to mending the tension between them, Manson ends the episode by giving Peter some more parental advice: Peter and Chris should start fishing. Production Louis Gossett, Jr. guest starred in the episode. The scene in which recruitment officers enter public schools in an attempt to recruit children is based on real life, as the Army has often sent recruiters to high schools for seniors. More recently they have started with the younger grades even though there is a minimum age for enlistment. The show also featured the last (living) appearance of Johnny and Vern, the vaudeville performers; Stewie shoots them because, as MacFarlane comments, \\"people were getting sick of them\\", with David Goodman adding that \\"the show was relying on them too much\\". The duo return in \\"Back to the Woods\\", with Vern as a ghost and Johnny in Hell. Upon the receiving of the news that democracy has come to Iraq, one scene shows a man having a knife held to his throat, which caused some controversy after the episode was broadcast. Stewie also knowingly breaks the fourth wall in the episode, by speaking in a manner as if he were talking to the audience. In one scene, Stewie mentions the time \\"Peter went after that hockey coach\\" (making a veiled reference to \\"Hockey Dad\\" Thomas Junta), in the expectation of a cutaway gag. However, nothing happens, and Stewie comments, \\"Oh, no clip? Thought we had a clip\\". This scene was described as being a one off. In addition to the regular cast, actor Gary Cole, actor Louis Gossett, Jr., actress Juanita Jennings, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actor Samm Levine, voice actress Rachael MacFarlane, actor Denis Martel, voice actor Enn Reitel, actress Stacey Scowley, voice actor Fred Tatasciore and voice actor Wally Wingert guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Alex Breckenridge, Chris Cox, writer Tom Devanney, actor Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Actor Adam West also has a guest appearance in the episode. Cultural references French football player Zinedine Zidane as he appears in the episode, headbutting an old lady as part of her birthday telegram. The title is a pun on Steven Spielberg's hit war film Saving Private Ryan. Several scenes from the Army training contained real-life references; when the recruits are marching, they begin to sing and dance; this is a reference to West Side Story. Additionally, the recruitment video is set to the Def Leppard song \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\". When Peter visits a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist is Dr. Katz. The training is similar to that in the film Full Metal Jacket, also spoofing the scene when the Sergeant found contraband food. The Sergeant punishes Brian by informing him that he will have to listen to singles from Chris Gaines' album: this entire scene was based on a sketch from Saturday Night Live approximately 10 years ago. Peter references actor Gregory Peck and his \\"kids\\" with a cutaway gag featuring four Pecks in a car. Brian shown performing numerous different tasks to complete his army training is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, with the music playing in the background from Stripes. The lyrics Lois reads from the Wu-Tang Clan album is from the song \\"Bring Da Ruckus\\", the first track from their album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The scene where Marilyn Manson tells Chris about nutrition is a reference to an episode of Clone High, where Manson leads a musical scene about the importance of the food pyramid.\\"Clone High\\": Episodes. Clone High. Retrieved on 2009-02-27. The sign outside of the building where the Grammys are being held says \\"Welcome to the Grammys (Not You, Fred Durst)\\", a reference to the lead singer of Limp Bizkit. Stewie misunderstands the location of their deployment to be \\"Fraggle Ir-Rock\\", rather than Iraq, referring to the TV show Fraggle Rock. The scene where Zinedine Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake is based on the incident that happened in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, when Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. When Brian is frustrated with the recruits recommending Chris to join the Army, Stewie jokes that \\"10% of his high school class is off to fight another battle\\". After hearing Stewie, Brian says that he was plagiarizing from The Onion, since Brian read about the war in Iraq in The Onion. During the obstacle course, Brian rides a unicycle, solves a Rubik's Cube, plays Perfection, finds Waldo, offers a couple eating a salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend. Reception In a significant decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 8.45 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.0 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, slightly being edged out by The Simpsons, while still winning over series creator Seth MacFarlane's second show American Dad!. IGN commented that the portrayal of \\"service in the military is a hilarious satire of the current state of our military in Iraq\\". Iverson was also impressed with the episode's random flashback gags, commenting that \\"normally they are only groan-worthy,\\" receiving a final rating of 9/10. Brett Love of TV Squad noted that \\"The Full Metal Jacket/Stripes angle for Stewie and Brian was great, right down to the Stripes music during the obstacle course. And Louis Gossett, Jr. as Sergeant Angryman is a nice bit of casting.\\" References  External links   Family Guy (season 5) episodes 2006 American television episodes Television episodes about the Iraq War Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist ","title":"Saving Private Brian"},{"id":"6419541","text":"Grzegorz Witold Ko≈Çodko (pronounced ; born 28 January 1949 in Tczew, Poland) is a distinguished professor of economics.

In babies with congenital heart defects, it is used by slow injection into a vein to open the ductus arteriosus until surgery can be carried out. By injection into the penis or placement in the urethra, it is used to treat erectile dysfunction. Common side effects when given to babies include decreased breathing, fever, and low blood pressure. When used for erectile dysfunction side effects may include penile pain, bleeding at the site of injection, and prolonged erection (priapism). Prostaglandin E1 is in the vasodilator family of medications. It works by opening blood vessels by relaxing smooth muscle. Prostaglandin E1 was isolated in 1957 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Medical uses  Patent ductus arteriosus  Alprostadil is also used in maintaining a patent ductus arteriosus in newborns. This is primarily useful when the threat of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus exists in an infant with ductal- dependent congenital heart disease, including cyanotic lesions (e.g., hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia/stenosis, tricuspid atresia/stenosis, transposition of the great arteries) and acyanotic lesions (e.g., coarctation of the aorta, critical aortic stenosis, and interrupted aortic arch).  Sexual dysfunction  Alprostadil is sold in the United States as urethral suppositories and in injectable form. The suppositories are sold under the brand name Muse. The injectable forms are EdexEdex - Facts and Comparisons Drugs.com and Caverject.Caverject - Facts and Comparisons Drugs.com Muse delivers alprostadil as a penile suppository, inserted into the urethra, at least ten minutes before the erection is needed. Caverject and Edex are similarly fast-acting, but instead are injected by syringe directly into the corpus cavernosum of the penis. Alprostadil is also available as a generic. The major cost is that it must be mixed by a compounding pharmacy and supplies may be difficult to obtain. The different formulations, including Bimix and Trimix, may include papaverine and/or phentolamine. A typical mix might be 30 mg of papaverine, 2 mg of phentolamine, and 20 Œºg alprostadil. As a generic, it is much less expensive than the packaged injectables. It is premixed and must be kept refrigerated and the user must load a syringe with the quantity needed. Most recently, the compound has been made easily accessible in an applicable topical cream form known as Vitaros.Vitaros 3 mg/g cream - Summary of Product Characteristics Medicines.org.uk Made by Takeda UK Ltd, it is now available in Europe and contains either 200 or 300 micrograms of alprostadil in 100 mg of cream which is directly administered as a topical cream applied to the urethra in a preloaded delivery device. The tip of the device is placed in the urethral meatus and the cream delivered into the urethra. Clinical trials for the treatment showed positive results in over 3000 men that it was tested on, and unlike other sexual dysfunction medication, it is said to be usable by men suffering from diabetes or heart problems and those who have undergone a prostatectomy.Vitaros- New Erectile Dysfunction Topical Treatment Meds4All.co.uk It has no known interactions with food, alcohol or other medications making it safer than other treatments containing alprostadil. Similarly to the Bimix and Trimix injections though, it must be kept under cool temperatures.  Critical limb ischemia  Prostanoids, including alprostadil, do not reduce the risk of limb amputation but may offer a slight improvement in rest-pain and leg ulcer healing in persons with critical limb ischemia.  Contrast-induced nephropathy  Preventative administration of alprostadil may reduce the risk of kidney injury (specifically contrast-induced nephropathy) in persons having cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention.

Since 2006 the club has been owned by Adam Gentile. History It was founded in 1969 but the building was built a couple decades prior. One of the notable differences between the Palomino and other Las Vegas strip clubs, is that it is allowed to have both a liquor license, and totally nude dancers. Other clubs with liquor licenses are restricted to topless dancers. This difference, according to 2003-2006 owner Luis Hidalgo Jr., is because the club was grandfathered until approximately 2025 with the different rules.\\"Palomino Club\\" listing at vegas.com In 2000, a high-profile murder trial involved the Palomino Club owner's son, Jack Perry, who had shot and killed one of the employees he thought was trying to buy the club. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 14 years to life in prison. In 2002, the owner of the \\"Olympic Garden\\" club sued the owners of the Palomino, claiming they conspired with cabdrivers to divert customers. It was evidently a common practice for some clubs, such as Palomino and Cheetah's, to offer $5‚Äì$25 per customer to cab drivers, to encourage the drivers to bring customers to their club instead of someone else's. This put \\"non-kickback\\" clubs such as the Olympic Garden at a disadvantage. The case was eventually dropped. (Jordan, 2004)reviewjournal.com - News: FOUR CHARGED: Police say rumors led to slaying Luis Hidalgo, Jr., took over the club in 2003. One of the changes that he instituted was to start an all-male nude act, known as the \\"Palomino Stallions\\", to try to attract female customers. In 2005, Luis Hidalgo Jr., his son, Luis Hidalgo III. and Hidalgo, Jr.'s longtime girlfriend, Anabel Espindola, were charged - and eventually found guilty - as co-conspirators in the contract murder of a former employee who had been telling competitors that Hidalgo Jr. was still paying cabdrivers to divert customers to the Palomino Club. Their former doorman, Timothy TJ Hadland, had been found shot to death on a road near Lake Mead on May 19, 2005, just two weeks after quitting the club. Three other Palomino employees, and the actual killer, were also found guilty on charges related to Hadland's killing. Their case was later shown on the TV show The First 48 on March 31, 2011 as a \\"Lost Episode\\".Local Strip Club At The Center Of Alleged Murder For Hire In 2007, Hidalgo sold the club to his lawyer, Dominic Gentile, in order to cover legal fees. Gentile is one of the city's more prominent defense attorneys, and received the land as payment from former Palomino owner Luis Hidalgo Jr. in exchange for Gentile's representation of Hidalgo in the investigation of the May 19, 2005, shooting death of Timothy Hadland. Dominic in turn turned the operation of the club over to his son, Adam Gentile, who had previously been the General Manager of Club Paradise. In 2009 Gentile let cameras into the club to film King Of Clubs, a new reality series slated to premiere in Fall 2009 on Playboy TV. That same year (2009), Hidalgo, Jr. and his son were sentenced to life in prison. The son's girlfriend took a plea deal for voluntary manslaughter in exchange for her testimony. Of note, Adam Gentile fought a number of amateur MMA fights and retired from fighting in 2014. Also of note, his main training partner and instructor was Brent Jordan, another well known longtime MMA fighter and bouncer who wrote a book about his experiences being a bouncer for 20 years, previously at Cheetah's in Las Vegas, and currently works as a VIP host for the Palomino Club.

The show originally aired on November 12, 2006. The plot follows Peter losing his fingers after an accident while holding fireworks. Behind on his work and threatened with the possibility of dismissal, he asks Lois to catch up on his work for him, to which she agrees. However, he repeatedly attempts to seduce her, eventually succeeding, distracting her from the work. Meanwhile, Brian begins dating a woman named Jillian who, much to Stewie's delight, lacks general knowledge and intelligence. The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Greg Colton. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was viewed in 9.04 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore, Bobby Costanzo, Barclay DeVeau, Carrie Fisher, Anne-Michelle Seiler and Audrey Wasilewski, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot The opening title sequence is different from many other episodes in that Peter trips during the theme song and injures a stage dancer (consequently puncturing her lung). Also, Stewie comes towards the camera screen and suggests they cut from the opening sequence. Quagmire returns home from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some fireworks into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start to play with the fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire. However, the M-80s detonate, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him. Meanwhile, Stewie finds out that Brian has a new girlfriend. Brian later (reluctantly) allows Stewie to meet his new girlfriend, Jillian. Stewie discovers she is a dumb blonde, and mocks Brian. Jillian visits the house, where Peter and Chris take an instant liking to her while Lois and Stewie find her stupidity amusing. The next day, Brian goes out with Jillian, where he meets her equally unintelligent friends. Stewie tells Brian that the relationship will not succeed. Brian visits Jillian's apartment to end the relationship (with Stewie waiting in his car), but he is distracted by her naked body when she answers the door and he has sex with her instead. Stewie apparently anticipated this when he returns three hours later, turns on the stereo, plays his mix tape, and starts singing to the tune of Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\": \\"Brian had sex/With a really dumb girl/Now he's taking his friend Stewie/To get some ice cream/In his car.\\" After Brian turns off the stereo, Stewie responds \\"Oh, you're a poor sport.\\". Production Episode Writer Steve Callaghan created the character of Jillian. The character of Jillian was altered several times by the show producers before its original airing; however, the final character personality was designed to be that of \\"a bulimic cheerleader.\\" The character of Jillian was also designed to be \\"not the brightest bauble on the tree,\\" but this too was repeatedly changed. The description of Jillian's voice being that of a bulimic cheerleader somewhat relates to a future episode plot, where Stewie calls Jillian fat, to which she responds by leaving the room and throwing up. When Stewie exclaims \\"it's like she's fucking five,\\" this was not set to broadcast at its original air date, but rather added in at a later date for unknown reasons. When Stewie is entertaining the elderly citizens by singing a song entitled \\"there's a hole in the bottom of the sea,\\" this is actually Seth MacFarlane's father playing the guitar, as he used to sing it to Seth when he was a child. During the making of this episode, not much thought was put into the character of Jillian, despite the fact she was always meant to be recurring character; although her regular appearances throughout season 5 were described as \\"a big thing for Family Guy.\\" In addition to the regular cast, actress Drew Barrymore, voice actor Bobby Costanzo, voice actor Barclay DeVeau, actress Carrie Fisher, voice actress Anne-Michelle Seiler and actress Audrey Wasilewski guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actor John G. Brennan, and writers Mike Henry, Mark Hentemann, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener made minor appearances. Actor Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode as well. Cultural references Show creator Seth MacFarlane claims on the DVD commentary track that, unlike most Family Guy episodes, this episode has no cultural references or references to real-world events except for Chris calling Meg \\"David Koresh\\" when they play with fireworks and the cutaway of Peter, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland spending last Saturday with the Lord of Darkness from Legend. There was also a discussion that the gang had about the show Wings while swimming in the beer tank. Quagmire admits that he is the most knowledgeable about the show because he is a pilot and the show focuses on two pilots. When Peter goes to look at his secret stash of pornography, the intro from Get Smart is referenced. Stewie asks Brian if Jillian has an alibi, and Brian says no. Stewie starts singing the song \\"U.G.L.Y.\\", understanding that Jillian does not have an alibi. Brian sets up a cutaway when he says that breaking up with Jillian will be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin. The ensuing gag shows the actors looking for mention of their play following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Reception In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.04 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.2 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, slightly being beat by The Simpsons, while still winning over American Dad!. IGN's Dan Iverson gave a mixed review, commenting that \\"it is only passable\\" and that \\"it did not have that laugh out loud funny\\" concept. However, Iverson positively comments that the voice of Jillian by Drew Barrymore was perfect. Iverson added that it's \\"pretty humorous in this episode was how they made fun of mediocre films.\\" In conclusion, Iverson gave the episode a final rating of 6.9/10. The press release for this episode commented that Jillian is a \\"very attractive but intellectually challenged,\\" giving no negative comments. The entire scene of Buzz Killington discussing bridges to Peter and his friends in a flashback is Barrymore's favorite scene.

In the past, the gothic church had a tower, which was the dominant feature of its surroundings, and it belonged to the most monumental sacral buildings in Turiec. The tower, a significant dominant of the town, fulfilled several roles: The town and its surroundings resounded with the ringing of its four bells. The largest one ‚Äì Obecn√Ω, was cast in 1704 and weighed 900 kg, the second one was called Odschod, the third one Median, and the fourth, which weighed 70 kg, bore the name of Umrl√°ƒç. A tiny bell was located separately in the church wall. The tower, situated at the church‚Äôs main fa√ßade, was built separately facing west, and had a rectangular ground plan of 8,6 x 7,2 m. Its height of 45 meters had to be supported by the thickness of the walls, with three of them being 1,5 m thick, and the fourth, common with the church wall, measuring 1,2 m. This thickness can also be observed today at the remnants of the tower wall. The basic building material was square and raw stone. The corners were accentuated by stone blocks. The tower was covered with a low pyramid-shaped roof with the original shingle covering. The Original gothic church in around 1910. Windows were located at two thirds of its height and were finished with arches. Under the windows, on three sides of the wall (southern, western and northern), ticked a tower clock. The predecessor of this clock was an ancient sundial situated in the southern side of the church wall. By the end of the 19th century, the church, at that time almost 600 years old, was considerably damaged and run-down. Because it was built on a marshland, the 1,5 m thick stone gothic vault began to crack on many places in spite of being secured by thick stone pillars at the sides of the church. The newly built church in 1913, before the tower's demolition There was a danger of the vault falling apart, and therefore the patron of the church ‚Äì Baron Franti≈°ek R√©vay ‚Äì ordered its demolition. Unlike its predecessor, the new neogothic church, which was created at the same site, took only 2 years to build (1912-1913). The building methods of the historizing sacral architecture were considerably close to today‚Äôs procedures. To secure the stability of the church, it was built on a thick concrete slab. The new church is displaced from its predecessor by a couple of meters in the southwestern direction. The new church has three aisles, and a lateral, hexagonal tower, which accommodates a staircase leading to the church gallery. Originally, the old tower was left intact. After a closer examination, however, it was found that it was leaning ‚Äì it diverged 45 cm from the vertical. Because of fears of its collapse, on 21 June 1913 it was decided that the old tower would be demolished, and a new one would be built in its place. As a support of this decision, Baron R√©vay donated 80.000 crowns for its construction. However, during the demolition the adjacent wall of the newly built church began to crack, and therefore the tower wall had to be rebuilt up to the height of the top of the church roof, and is still standing there in symbiosis with the church.

It runs east‚Äìwest in southwest Wisconsin from near Reedsburg to Baraboo. The route was first designated in 1917 but not as WIS 136 until 1935. The route was extended in 2017. Route description The highway begins at an intersection with WIS 23/WIS 33 east of Reedsburg. From there, it runs south along Copper Creek. Where Copper Creek drains into the Baraboo River, the highway follows the river in a southeasterly direction to Rock Springs, where it intersects WIS 154 and County Trunk Highway DD (CTH-DD). The highway then runs north of the Baraboo River in an easterly direction from Rock Springs. It intersects CTH-I and continues east and then starts running along Linn Street into West Baraboo. It intersects US 12, where it starts running concurrently with WIS 33 until the concurrency ends at Pine Street, on which it runs south. The highway continues along the Pine Street alignment until it curves to the west, at which point the highway runs east from it. The highway then reaches CTH-DL, and runs concurrently with it until ending at the entrance of Devil's Lake State Park. History A highway running near or along the Baraboo River from Reedsburg to Baraboo was designated when the state highway system was established in 1917 as part of WIS 33. In 1935, WIS 33 was rerouted to the north and the bypassed section was redesignated as WIS 136. A former WIS 136 designation running from the current route near North Freedom to Prairie du Sac was downgraded to a County Trunk Highway. The highway was unpaved along its entire route and would remain unpaved until at least 1956. WIS 159 The highway's eastern terminus before it was extended Wisconsin Highway 159 (WIS 159) was a highway that ran from US 12 south of Baraboo to the entrance of Devil's Lake State Park. The highway was first designated in 1924, as a connection between WIS 12 (later US 12) and WIS 123 near its southern terminus at Devil's Lake State Park. It wasn't paved and would remain that way until at least 1956. In 2016, WIS 123 was decommisioned and the section between WIS 159 and the Devil's Lake State Park entrance would become part of WIS 159. In 2017, it (along with the part of US 12 between it and WIS 136) was redesignated as part of WIS 136 after US 12 was bypassed near Baraboo.

The park is on Pennsylvania Route 16 along Tuscarora Mountain. Buchanan's Birthplace State Park was created from land donated to the state by Harriet Lane in honor of her uncle, the 15th President of the United States, James Buchanan. Recreation Recreation facilities are limited. There are two pavilions and a number of picnic tables. Drinking water and two restrooms are located near the picnic area. A pyramid built with native stone stands at the site of the cabin where President Buchanan was born. Buck Run runs through the park and has a population of native trout for fishing. Tuscarora Trail, a bypass trail for the Appalachian Trail, passes just to the west of the park. Buchanan's Birthplace President James Buchanan was born into an Ulster Scots family on April 23, 1791, near the village of Cove Gap. He was born in a log cabin on property owned by his father. The complex was known as Stony Batter, named for the family home near Ramelton in County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland. At the time of Buchanan's birth, the Cove Gap area was on the edge of the American frontier. Today it is a quite isolated area, but when President Buchanan was born it was a center of frontier commerce. Stony Batter was a complex of cabins, barns, stables, storehouses, a general store, and an orchard. Pioneers travelling from the East Coast through Cove Gap stopped at Stony Batter to rest and replenish their supplies. Buchanan lived at Stony Batter until he was six years old, when his father moved his business to Mercersburg. Monument Harriet Lane Johnston was President Buchanan's niece and since he never married she served as his First Lady. She led the effort to create a memorial to her uncle. She made several efforts to purchase his birthplace, Stony Batter, but was ultimately unsuccessful. When she wrote her will in 1895, she created a trust whose task it was to pursue the construction of monuments to her uncle. Upon Harriet Lane's death, in 1903, the responsibility for building the monument devolved upon a banker from Washington, D.C., E. Francis Riggs and a lawyer from Baltimore, Lawrason Riggs (not to be confused with E. Francis' brother of the same name). As the area was no longer a center of commerce, and had become a remote place, it is uncertain why it took years to purchase Stony Batter, but the Riggs' were finally successful in doing so in 1907. The monument in the shape of a pyramid was built of native stone. Wyatt and Nolting, an architectural firm from Baltimore, designed the memorial. The pyramid is square and high. It is made of of American Gray Granite and 250 tons of mortar and native stones. Construction of the pyramid began in October 1907 with a work force of 20 men. They built a small railroad to haul the heavy materials from the mountainside to the construction site. The work force grew to 35 men and the monument was completed by late winter with a surrounding iron railing. The Pennsylvania General Assembly of 1911 accepted the monument from the trust of Harriet Lane Johnston and Buchanan's Birthplace State Park was formally established.

Typically Friends meeting houses do not have steeples. History Quakers do not believe that meeting for worship has to occur in any special place. They believe that \\"where two or three meet together in my name, I am there among them\\" (Revised English Bible, Matthew, Ch 18, v 20). Therefore, meeting for worship may take place in any place. Early Quakers often met for worship outdoors or in local public buildings. However, when the Religious Society of Friends began to grow there became a need for buildings to house their meetings. Quakers have always reserved the word church to mean the body of people who make up the worshipping community: Quakers do not use the word church to refer to the bricks and mortar of a worshipping community. George Fox, an early Quaker, spoke of places of worship that have steeples as steeple houses, and those that do not as meeting houses. This practice is shared by a number of other non-conformist Christian denominations, including Unitarians, Christadelphians, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Mennonites. Some Friends meeting houses were adapted from existing structures, but most were purpose-built. Briggflatts Meeting House in Cumbria, England is an example of the latter. The hallmark of a meeting house is extreme simplicity and the absence of any liturgical symbols. More specifically, though, the defining characteristics of the Quaker meetinghouse are simplicity, equality, community, and peace. Though never explicitly written or spoken about, these tenets (or ‚ÄúTestimonies‚Äù) of Quakerism were the basic, and only, guidelines for building a meetinghouse, as was seen through the continuity of the use of Testimonies within meetinghouse design. While meetinghouse design evolved over time to a standardization of the double-cell structure without explicit guidelines for building, the meetinghouse‚Äôs reflective architecture revealed a deeper meaning. The meetinghouse design manifested and enhanced Quaker Testimonies and the cultivation of the Inner Light that was essential to Friends. Quakers easily moved from one place of meeting to another, but when given the opportunity to design and construct their own place of meeting, Friends infused their Testimonies in the planning, design, and construction of the building. Interior of the Colora Meetinghouse in Maryland, showing the facing benches and the moveable divider typical of 18th and 19th century meetinghouses in the area Meeting Houses built in a traditional style usually had two meeting rooms: one for the main meeting for worship, and another where the women's business meeting may be held (often referred to as the women's meeting room). Meeting houses of this style usually have a minister's gallery at one end of the meeting room, where traditionally those traveling in the ministry would have sat, with an elders bench immediately in front of this. Wooden benches facing this occupy the rest of the room, often with a gallery for extra seating. Meeting houses of this style usually have high windows so that worshippers sitting in meeting for worship cannot see outside. Meeting houses built in a more modern design will usually consist of: a large meeting room, smaller rooms for committees, children's classes, etc., a kitchen and toilets. The meeting room itself is a place for Friends to withdraw from the world. The windows are set sufficiently high that worshippers will not be distracted by the activities of the world's people outside, or in some cases they provide a view into the meeting house garden. The seating was originally long, hard and wooden. Today it is usually separate chairs but the layout remains the same ‚Äì a square or rectangle facing inwards to a central table.

It runs from its western terminus at U.S. Route 2 (US 2) west of Ashland to its eastern terminus at Wisconsin Highway 13 (WIS 13) in Ashland. Like all Wisconsin state highways, WIS 137 is maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). Route description WIS 137 begins at a four-way intersection with US 2 and a local road (Kanes Road) in an unincorporated area of eastern Bayfield County, about west of Ashland,. (US 2 heads northeast through Ashland and on to Odanah and then Ironwood, Michigan. US 2 heads west to connect with the northern terminus of U.S. Route 63 and then on to Iron River and Superior. Kanes road continues north for only about before becoming a dirt farm road.) From its western terminus WIS 137 heads easterly as a two-lane road and promptly curves from a southeast direction to head due east through rual farmland for about . The highway then curves to the northeast and continues in that direction until it nearly reaches the Tri- County Corridor (an ATV rail trail on the grade of a former Northern Pacific Railway rail line which runs from Superior to Ashland). The highway then heads easterly (running roughly parallel to, but south of, the Tri-County Corridor for the remainder of its course). About after resuming its easterly course, the highway crosses over the South Fish Creek. About later it leaves Bayfield County and enters both Ashland County and the city of Ashland. Within Ashland WIS 137 is initially signed as Golf Course Road. (The name comes from the Chequamegon Bay Golf Club, along the north side of which the highway passes). About after entering Ashland and after turning to head northeast, WIS 137 intersects Wisconsin Highway 112 (WIS 112), locally known as Sanborn Avenue, at a four-way intersection. (WIS 112 heads north to its northern terminus at US 2 and south to connect with the eastern terminus of Wisconsin Highway 118 before ending at WIS 13, about south of Ashland.) After crossing WIS 112, WIS 137 becomes 6th Street and continues heading northeast, passing along the south side of Central Railyard Park, to its eastern terminus at a four-way intersection with WIS 13 (Ellis Avenue South), about after crossing WIS 112. (WIS 13 heads north to its northern terminus at US 2 and south to pass through the campus of Northland College, cross the Bad River, and connect with the southern terminus of WIS 112‚Äîabout south of Ashland‚Äìbefore continuing on to it southern terminus in Mellen.) History The original WIS 137 was assigned in 1923 to a short highway between Wisconsin Highway 39 and Wisconsin Highway 23 in Iowa County. This route became a county road in 1934, and the WIS 137 designation was reassigned to another route in Iowa County between Wisconsin Highway 80 in Avoca and Wisconsin Highway 130 in Lone Rock. WIS 137 remained on this route until 1968, when it was replaced by Wisconsin Highway 133. The WIS 137 designation was assigned to its current route in the Ashland area in 1971; it replaced WIS 112, which was rerouted in the area.

A major application of petrophysics is in studying reservoirs for the hydrocarbon industry. Petrophysicists are employed to help reservoir engineers and geoscientists understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons. Some of the key properties studied in petrophysics are lithology, porosity, water saturation, permeability and density. A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring well log measurements ‚Äì in which a string of measurement tools are inserted in the borehole, core measurements ‚Äì in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface, and seismic measurements. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir. While most petrophysicists work in the hydrocarbon industry, some also work in the mining and water resource industries. The properties measured or computed fall into three broad categories: conventional petrophysical properties, rock mechanical properties, and ore quality. Petrophysical studies are used by petroleum engineering, geology, mineralogy, exploration geophysics and other related studies. Conventional petrophysical properties Most petrophysicists are employed (SS) to compute what are commonly called conventional (or reservoir) petrophysical properties. These are: Lithology: A description of the rock's physical characteristics, such as grain size, composition and texture. By studying the lithology of local geological outcrops and core samples, geoscientists can use a combination of log measurements, such as natural gamma, neutron, density and resistivity, to determine the lithology down the well. Porosity: \\\\phi (Anti=tattilization)The percentage of a given volume of rock that is pore space and can therefore contain fluids.\\"Porosity\\", Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Retrieved 12 October 2018. This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the reaction of the rock to bombardment by neutrons or by gamma rays but can also be derived from sonic and NMR logging. Water saturation: The fraction of the pore space occupied by water.\\"Water saturation\\", Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Retrieved 12 October 2018. This is typically calculated using data from an instrument that measures the resistivity of the rock and is known by the symbol S_w. Permeability: The quantity of fluid (usually hydrocarbon) that can flow through a rock as a function of time and pressure, related to how interconnected the pores are. Formation testing is so far the only tool that can directly measure a rock formation's permeability down a well. In case of its absence, which is common in most cases, an estimate for permeability can be derived from empirical relationships with other measurements such as porosity, NMR and sonic logging. Thickness of rock with enough permeability to deliver fluids to a well bore. This property is often called ‚ÄúNet reservoir rock.‚Äù In the oil and gas industry, another quantity ‚ÄúNet Pay‚Äù is computed which is the thickness of rock that can deliver hydrocarbons to the well bore at a profitable rate. Reservoir models are built upon their measured and derived properties to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon present in the reservoir, the rate at which that hydrocarbon can be produced to the Earth's surface through wellbores and the fluid flow in rocks. In the water resource industry, similar models are used to compute how much water can be produced to the surface over long periods of time, without depleting the aquifer. Rock mechanical properties Some petrophysicists use acoustic and density measurements of rocks to compute their mechanical properties and strength. They measure the compressional (P) wave velocity of sound through the rock and the shear (S) wave velocity and use these with the density of the rock to compute the rocks' compressive strength, which is the compressive stress that causes a rock to fail, and the rocks' flexibility, which is the relationship between stress and deformation for a rock. Converted-wave analysis is also used to determine subsurface lithology and porosity. These measurements are useful to design programs to drill wells that produce oil and gas. The measurements are also used to design dams, roads, foundations for buildings, and many other large construction projects. They can also be used to help interpret seismic signals from the Earth, either man-made seismic signals or those from earthquakes. Ore quality Bore holes can be drilled into ore bodies (for example coal seams or gold ore) and either rock samples taken to determine the ore or coal quality at each bore hole location or the wells can be wireline logged to make measurements that can be used to infer quality. Some petrophysicists do this sort of analysis. The information is mapped and used to make mine development plans. Methods of analysis Coring and core analysis is a direct measurement of petrophysical properties. In the petroleum industry rock samples are retrieved from subsurface and measured by core labs of oil company or some commercial core measurement service companies. This process is time consuming and expensive, thus can not be applied to all the wells drilled in a field. Figure 1 Well Logging is used as a relatively inexpensive method to obtain petrophysical properties downhole. Measurement tools are conveyed downhole using either wireline or LWD method. An example of wireline logs is shown in Figure 1. The first ‚Äútrack‚Äù, shows the natural gamma radiation level of the rock. The gamma radiation level ‚Äúlog‚Äù shows increasing radiation to the right and decreasing radiation to the left. The rocks emitting less radiation have more yellow shading. The detector is very sensitive and the amount of radiation is very low. In clastic rock formations, rocks that have smaller amounts of radiation are more likely to be coarser grained and have more pore space, rocks with higher amounts of radiation are more likely to have finer grains and less pore space. The second track over in the plot records the depth below the reference point which is usually the Kelly bush or rotary table in feet, so these rocks are 11,900 feet below the surface of earth. In the third track, the electrical resistivity of the rock is presented. The water in this rock is salty and the salt in the water causes the water to be electrically conductive such that lower resistivity is caused by increasing water saturation and decreasing hydrocarbon saturation. The fourth track, shows the computed water saturation, both as ‚Äútotal‚Äù water (including the water bound to the rock) in magenta and the ‚Äúeffective water‚Äù or water that is free to flow in black. Both quantities are given as a fraction of the total pore space. The fifth track shows the fraction of the total rock that is pore space, filled with fluids. The display of the pore space is divided into green for oil and blue for movable water. The black line shows the fraction of the pore space which contains either water or oil that can move, or be ‚Äúproduced.‚Äù In addition to what is included in blackline, the magenta line includes the water that is permanently bound to the rock. The last track is a representation of the solid portion of the rock. The yellow pattern represents the fraction of the rock (excluding fluids) that is composed of coarser grained sandstone. The gray pattern represents the fraction of rock that is composed of finer grained ‚Äúshale.‚Äù The sandstone is the part of the rock that contains the producible hydrocarbons and water.

The story is about an English girl who elopes with a debonair French actor; he goes off to serve in the Franco-Prussian War, and his friend, who bears a grudge against the English, tells his bride that he has been killed in action. The musical is remembered as Ellis's best work and for the recordings of \\"This is my lovely day\\" and \\"I was never kissed before\\", with the original stars Lizbeth Webb and Georges Gu√©tary. The original production opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 26 April 1947 and ran for 886 performances. A revival was presented in London as Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1987. Original production The show was Charles B. Cochran's 125th production. Cochran had signed 19-year-old Adele Leigh as the lead, but the next day the new Royal Opera offered her principal roles. After much negotiation, Cochran released her from the contract and hired Lizbeth Webb.\\"Obituaries: Adele Leigh\\", The Telegraph, accessed 21 June 2013 The musical opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 26 April 1947, just before Oklahoma!, and was directed by Wendy Toye. It was not overshadowed by the American hit, enjoying a good reception from the critics and audiences, and running for three years and a total of 886 performances. The production was notable for its highly stylised scenery by Tanya Moiseiwitsch, a break with the realism of earlier musical comedy sets. One of Webb's songs with Gu√©tary, \\"This Is My Lovely Day\\", became one of the BBC's most requested songs of all times, and the song's popularity, and that of the show, were increased by their association with the wedding in 1947 of Princess Elizabeth and Lt. Philip Mountbatten.Coveney, Michael. \\"Lizbeth Webb obituary\\", The Guardian, 27 January 2013 Only four of the songs were recorded as studio singles by the original cast. A \\"disappointing\\" studio recording was made in 1967 with Mary Millar and Roberto Cardinali, In 1994, a recording of songs by the original cast was released, produced by David Cunard, as a result of a discovery in the United States of recordings of a radio broadcast.  Synopsis  Lucy Willow and sisters prepare for the wedding ;Act I In Victorian England, it is 1870, the eve of the Franco-Prussian War, and a young woman, Lucy Veracity Willow, is having second thoughts about her imminent marriage to the Hon. Thomas Trout. He will not join her in her favourite game of croquet, preferring the \\"shocking\\" new game of lawn tennis (\\"Croquet, Croquet\\" / \\"What Will Mother Say\\"). Worse, he makes good-natured but pointed fun of her principles, especially her attachment to the truth (\\"Too Good to Be True\\"). She is resigned to her duty to marry the man approved by her parents, but bemoans the lack of love in their relationship (\\"Any Man but Thomas T.\\"). Thomas introduces Lucy to a couple of new French friends of his, the debonair and romantic Pierre Fontaine, an actor, and his companion Suzanne, who is also on the stage. Lucy and Pierre quickly fall in love (\\"I Was Never Kissed Before\\"), much to Suzanne's chagrin, and they elope to France together in the middle of the elaborate preparations for Lucy and Thomas' wedding (\\"Bless the Bride\\"). Set for Act II, showing the highly stylised design of the production ;Act II In France, Pierre and Lucy are with Suzanne, who seems to be overcoming her initial jealousy of Lucy and is acting as chaperone until the couple can be married (\\"Mon Pauvre Petit Pierre\\"). The three take a table in a beachside restaurant (\\"A Table for Two\\" / \\"This Is My Lovely Day\\"). Into the restaurant crash Lucy's father, mother, cousin George, and the jilted Thomas, who is determined to fight a duel with Pierre if they can find him (\\"The Englishman\\"). They have come to \\"rescue\\" Lucy, and to this end have adopted disguises (including heavy beards). Their efforts to pass themselves off as French arouse suspicions, and Lucy and Suzanne have to step in to vouch for the party, saving them from arrest as Prussian spies. Lucy declares her love for Pierre to her family, and Thomas confronts Pierre. Dramatic news arrives of the declaration of the Franco-Prussian War. Pierre is a reserve officer and must leave at once to join his regiment. Suzanne and the exultant French crowd leave with him (\\"To France\\") ‚Äì while poor Lucy must return to England with her family. A year passes, and it is Lucy's twenty-first birthday (\\"Here's a Kiss\\"). A message has arrived from Suzanne telling her that Pierre was killed in the disastrous war. A chastened Thomas renews his suit for Lucy's hand. She tells him that she cannot forget Pierre but will marry him if he does not rush the date of the wedding.

Bats are the only extant native terrestrial mammals in Puerto Rico. All other terrestrial mammals in the area were introduced by humans, and include species such as cats, goats, sheep, the small Asian mongoose, and escaped monkeys. Marine mammals include dolphins, manatees, and whales. Of the 349 bird species, about 120 breed in the archipelago, and 47.5% are accidental or rare. The most recognizable and famous animal of Puerto Rico is probably the common coqu√≠, a small endemic frog, and one of the 86 species that constitute Puerto Rico's herpetofauna. Some native freshwater fish inhabit Puerto Rico, but some species, introduced by humans, have established populations in reservoirs and rivers. The low richness-high diversity pattern is also apparent among invertebrates, which constitutes most of the archipelago's fauna. The arrival of the first people about 4,000 years ago and, to a larger extent, of Europeans more than 500 years ago, had a significant effect on Puerto Rico's fauna. Hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of non-native species to Puerto Rico led to extinctions and extirpations (local extinctions). Conservation efforts, the most notable being for the Puerto Rican parrot, began in the second half of the 20th century. According to IUCN, as of 2002, there were 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: two mammals, eight breeding birds, eight reptiles, and three amphibians. Origin of Puerto Rican fauna Geographic location of Puerto Rico The Caribbean Plate, an oceanic tectonic plate on which Puerto Rico and the Antilles (with the exception of Cuba) lie, was formed in the late Mesozoic. According to Rosen, when South America separated from Africa, a volcanic archipelago known as \\"Proto-Antilles\\" was formed. It later divided into the present-day Greater and Lesser Antilles because of a new fault line in the \\"Proto-Antilles\\". Geologically, the archipelago of Puerto Rico is young, having formed about 135 Ma (million years) ago. The prevailing hypothesis, proposed by Howard Meyerhoff, posits that the Puerto Rican Bank, consisting of Puerto Rico, its outlying islands, and the Virgin Islands with the exception of St. Croix, was formed from volcanism in the Cretaceous Period. Rock samples from Sierra Bermeja in southwestern Puerto Rico, dated to the late Jurassic/early Cretaceous period, confirm this theory. There is ongoing debate over when and how the ancestors of vertebrate fauna colonized the Antilles‚Äîparticularly whether the Proto-Antilles were oceanic islands or whether they once formed a land connection between South and North America. The first, and prevailing, model favors overwater dispersal from continental, primarily South American, fauna; the other suggests the vicarization of proto- Antillean fauna. Hedges et al. conclude that dispersal was \\"the primary mechanism for the origin of West Indian biota\\". Vertebrate terrestrial genera such as Eleutherodactylus dispersed in a \\"filter\\" effect among the islands before any vicarization event occurred. However, other fauna such as the endemic Antillean insectivores (Nesophontes sp., Solenodon marcanoi and others) and freshwater fish appear to have colonized the West Indies earlier through other means. Woods provides evidence to support this hypothesis by analyzing the arrival of ancestors of the Antillean capromyids and echimyids, concluding that an ancient echimyid must have arrived on the Greater Antilles from South America either by island-hopping through the Lesser Antilles or by rafting either to Puerto Rico or Hispaniola.Woods, C. A. (1989). \\"A new capromyid rodent from Haiti:the origin, evolution, and extinction of West Indian rodents, and their bearing on the origin of New World hystricognaths\\". In C. C. Black and M. R. Dawson (eds.), Papers on fossil rodents in honor of Albert Elmer Wood. Nat Hist. Mus. Los Angeles County Sci. Ser. 33:59‚Äì90. MacPhee and Iturralde provide an alternate hypothesis that the initiators of land mammal clades arrived on the Proto-Antilles by the mid-Tertiary period, approximately at the Eocene‚ÄìOligocene boundary. A short-lived (~1 Ma) landmass named \\"GAARlandia\\" (Greater Antilles + Aves Ridge land) connected northwestern South America with three of the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico) during this period. Afterwards, during the fragmentation of the Proto- Antilles, divergence of vacariated lines would have begun. The last major changes in Puerto Rican fauna occurred about 10,000 years ago as a result of the post-Ice Age rise in sea level and associated environmental changes. Puerto Rico's transformation from a dry savanna environment to its present moist, forested state led to mass extinctions, especially of the vertebrate fauna. Around this time, the Puerto Rican Bank‚Äîa single landmass comprising the archipelago of Puerto Rico (except for Mona, Monito and Desecheo) and the Virgin Islands (except for St. Croix)‚Äîbecame separated. The Puerto Rican Bank has never been connected to its closest eastern bank, St. Maarten. Mammals Artistic representation of the extinct Puerto Rican shrew The richness of mammals in Puerto Rico, like many other islands, is low relative to mainland regions. The present-day native terrestrial mammal fauna of Puerto Rico is composed of only 13 species, all of which are bats. 18 marine mammals, including manatees, dolphins and whales, occur in Puerto Rico. Fossil records show the existence of one shrew (Puerto Rican shrew, Nesophontes edithae), one sloth (Puerto Rican sloth),Some authorities recognize two species of sloths occurring in Puerto Rico, the greater Puerto Rican sloth (Acratocnus major) and the lesser Puerto Rican sloth (Acratocnus odontrigonus). three additional leaf-nosed bats (Macrotus waterhousii, Monophyllus plethodon, and Phyllonycteris major),G.

Boca Raton, Florida, . Woods suggests a reason for their extinction: \\"Taxa evolving in isolation on oceanic islands without competition or predators may not be able to adapt to rapidly changing conditions, such as the extensive climatic fluctuations of the Ice Ages or sudden competition or predation from introduced animals\\".Woods, C. A. (1990). \\"The fossil and recent land mammals of the West Indies: an analysis of the origin, evolution, and extinction of an insular fauna\\", pp. 641‚Äì680 in International symposium on biogeographical aspects of insularity. Rome, Italy. Other terrestrial mammals have been introduced throughout the history of Puerto Rico. Indigenous settlers first introduced dogs and guinea pigs from South or Central America. Afterwards, Ta√≠nos introduced hutias as a food source from Hispaniola. When the Spanish colonized the island in the early 16th century, they introduced domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, goats, pigs, cattle, horses, and donkeys. Other species such as black rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus sp.) have been unintentionally introduced as stowaways, possibly since Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1493. More recently, species have been introduced as a means of biological pest control. For example, the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was introduced in the 19th century to control the damage caused by rats in sugar cane plantations. The introduction was a failure: the mongoose failed to control the rat population and instead contributed to the decline of native fauna such as the yellow-shouldered blackbird and possibly the elfin- woods warbler. Rhesus macaques, a mammal introduced to Puerto Rico As part of a study on adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were introduced to the island of Desecheo and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals. West Indian manatee, an aquatic mammal of Puerto Rico Arguably the best known of aquatic mammals occurring in Puerto Rican waters is the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) which is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. The archipelago's waters are one of the species' main breeding areas. Manatees gathered local media attention when a two-month manatee nicknamed Mois√©s was rescued and raised for 27 months by the Caribbean Stranding Network (CSN). Mois√©s was the first successful release of an orphaned, captive-raised manatee to the marine environment in the Caribbean. The animal became a Puerto Rican cultural, as well as scientific, icon when Tony Croatto wrote a song titled \\"Mois√©s\\". A municipality of Puerto Rico, Manat√≠ is believed to be named after the species. Puerto Rico's waters are also an important breeding site for the humpback whale during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. Humpback whale watching is a popular tourist attraction in the municipality of Rinc√≥n in western Puerto Rico. Bats Extant bats of Puerto Rico belong to five families (Noctilionidae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae) and include a total of 13 species, of which six subspecies are endemic to the archipelago. Seven of the 13 species are insectivores, four can be considered frugivores, one species feeds on nectar and another on fish. The species total is a relatively low number in comparison to the other Greater Antilles. Jamaica, for example, with an area approximately 1.2 times that of Puerto Rico, has 21 species (1.6 times that of Puerto Rico). A possible explanation for this is the comparatively large distance between the archipelago and the mainland dispersion areas. Jamaica, for example, is closer to Cuba and Hispaniola which are themselves closer to the mainland dispersion areas of North and Central America. Bats play an important role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays an important role in the ecology of tabonucoTabonuco or Dacryodes excelsa. forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two. The bat species that occur in the archipelago of Puerto Rico are: greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus), Antillean ghost- faced bat (Mormoops blainvillii), Parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii), sooty mustached bat (Pteronotus quadridens), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), Antillean fruit bat (Brachyphylla cavernarum), buffy flower bat (Erophylla sezekorni bombifrons), Leach's single leaf bat (Monophyllus redmani), red fruit bat (Stenoderma rufum), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), velvety free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus), and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). Birds Bananaquit, the most abundant bird in Puerto Rico The avifauna of Puerto Rico is composed of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning that they have been sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, either directly or indirectly (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago. The avifauna of the West Indies is predominantly of tropical North American (southern North America and Central America) origin with aggressive South American species having colonized the area only recently. The South American families occurring in the Greater Antilles are the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), bananaquit (Coerebidae) and tanagers (Thraupidae), all of which are represented in Puerto Rico. The prevailing theory suggests that bird fauna colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. The most primitive West Indies birds are the todies which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican tody. Yellow- shouldered blackbird, one of the 16 endemic birds of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico's avifauna has diminished due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for a species of swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago).Evidence also suggests that the fossil may come from the Wisconsin glaciation. The species is believed to have become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi).The Antillean cave rail may have also occurred in the Virgin Islands. With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it is still one of the ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black- bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago. Amphibians and reptiles Puerto Rican crested toad, an endemic amphibian species of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico's herpetofauna consists of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade is believed to have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, has one of the highest percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), Hylidae (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman. All species of Ranidae and Hylidae occurring in Puerto Rico are introduced. One species from the family Bufonidae, the cane toad, is introduced while the other, the Puerto Rican crested toad, is endemic and critically endangered. The cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the 1920s to control the populations of white-grub (Phyllophaga spp.), a sugar cane pest. All species from the family Leptodactylidae are native to the region. Of the 18 Leptodactylidae species, 17 are from the genus Eleutherodactylus and are commonly known in Puerto Rico as coqu√≠s. Three of these, the web-footed coqu√≠, the golden coqui and the mottled coqui, are likely to be extinct. The golden coqui is the only live-bearing species from the family Leptodactylidae and Cook's robber frog (E. cooki) is the only Eleutherodactylus sp. that exhibits sexual dimorphism in both size and color. The common coqu√≠ (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is an unofficial national symbol of Puerto Rico and an important aspect of Puerto Rican culture. Since 14 of the 17 coqu√≠s are endemic to the archipelago, a common phrase used by Puerto Ricans to assert their national pride is \\"De aqu√≠ como el coqu√≠\\" (From here Puerto Rico like the coqu√≠). Hawksbill turtle, a critically endangered species Puerto Rico's turtle fauna includes both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, is the only representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican boa, Puerto Rico's largest snake The 11 snake species occurring in Puerto Rico are generally considered non- venomous, although research has concluded that at least one species, the Puerto Rican racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom. These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera: Typhlopidae (genus Typhlops), Boidae (Epicrates) and Colubridae (Alsophis and Arrhyton). The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inornatus) with a maximum length of 12 ft (3.7 m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (Ameiva, Anolis, geckos), coqu√≠s and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa). The largest terrestrial lizard of the archipelago of Puerto Rico is the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). A subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta), it is endemic to Mona Island, located in the Mona Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Another Cyclura species of similar size, the Anegada ground iguana (Cyclura pinguis), once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to Anegada. The most common lizard in Puerto Rico is the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus). The anole lizards of Puerto Rico, and the Greater Antilles in general, represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation. Anole lizards in the Greater Antilles are more closely related to other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island. Fish White grunt (Haemulon plumieri), one of the most common reef fish in the Caribbean The first fish descriptions from Puerto Rico were compiled by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, there are over 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food, mosquito control, and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass. Accidental introductions, such as the sailfin armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed to the release of aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including largemouth bass, peacock bass, and channel catfish, and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers. Three types of habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, are found in Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species.Wilkinson, p. 438An annotated shallow-water species list from the Puerto Rican Bank may be found here. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are representative of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage. Invertebrates The invertebrate fauna of Puerto Rico is high in richness but low in diversity relative to mainland neotropical faunas of similar size and habitat diversity. Puerto Rico, in comparison to other Antillean islands, is the most extensively studied in regards to invertebrates. Aedes aegypti, arguably the best-known mosquito of Puerto Rico and host of the dengue and CHIKV viruses Puerto Rico's insect fauna, similar to the majority of major invertebrate taxa in the archipelago, is considered depauperate when compared to its mainland counterparts.Reagan and Waide, pp. 190‚Äì192 For example, approximately 300 species of butterfly occur in Puerto Rico, in contrast to more than 600 species in Trinidad and more than 1,500 species documented from a 7.5 km2 region in Brazil. As of 1998, out of the estimated 925,000 described insect species, only 5,573 were documented from Puerto Rico. In terms of diversity, of the 31 extant insect orders, 27 have representatives in Puerto Rico. The orders without reported representatives are Microcoryphia, Grylloblattaria, Plecoptera, and Mecoptera. The largest insect depository in Puerto Rico resides at the Museo de Entomolog√≠a y Biodiversidad Tropical (Museum of Entomology and Tropical Biodiversity), part of the Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of Puerto Rico. Arachnids are important to the forest ecology, as both predators and prey. In some forest types, such as tabonuco forest, they are the major arboreal invertebrate predators; spiders being the most abundant representative.Reagan and Waide, p. 267 The Maricao Commonwealth Forest's 27 spider species belong to five families: Uloboridae, Pholcidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae and Araneidae. Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National Forest, is believed to be parthenogenetic, meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male. Other terrestrial invertebrates described from Puerto Rico include earthworms and cave dwelling animals. Eighteen native species of earthworm have been described, with 11 species belonging to the family Glossoscolecidae, 3 to the family Megascolecidae, and 4 to the family Exxidae.The taxonomic classification provided in Hendrix (1995) has been revised and this article presents the current classification. Seventy-eight invertebrate species are known to inhabit Puerto Rico's caves. Six of these species are restricted to the Antilles, 23 come from North America and 23 are endemic to Puerto Rico. Only two of the species are confirmed as troglobites, or restricted to caves. Forty-five percent of the species are predators while the remaining 55% are guano scavengers, detritivores and herbivores. It is believed that most of this fauna arrived at Puerto Rico in the Pleistocene. Elkhorn coral, listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2006 The marine invertebrate fauna of Puerto Rico is composed of 61 sponges, 171 cnidarians, 8 nemerteans, 1,176 mollusks, 129 annelids (polychaetes), 342 crustaceans, 165 echinoderms, 131 bryozoans, 117 hard corals, 99 soft corals and gorgonians, 13 corallimorphs, and 8 hydrocorals.Wilkinson, p. 434. Coral species found in Puerto Rican reefs are representative of the general Caribbean fauna. Commonly occurring corals include boulder star coral (Montrastaea annularis), finger coral (Porites porites), and elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata). Invertebrate introductions have had an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, one of the most abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.Reagan and Waide, pp. 159‚Äì160. Human effect and conservation The fauna of Puerto Rico has been subjected to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles,Wiewandt, T.A. (1975). Management of Introduced Fauna: Appendix to the Department of Natural Resources Management Plan for the Mona Island Unit. USDI Bureau of. Sport Fish and Wildlife. Project W-8-18, Study III. Atlanta. Georgia. and mongooses have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledglings. Conservation efforts include both land and species protection. Approximately 8.95 km2 (equal to 3.4% of total land area) divided among 34 reserves are protected in Puerto Rico. According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 endangered species.Puerto Rico's wildlife comprehensive strategy, p. 2 The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment. Puerto Rican parrot. Conservation efforts have saved this species from extinction. Birds currently receive the greatest attention in regards to conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS), established in 1997, is a program with the purpose of monitoring the status and trends of Puerto Rican breeding bird populations. The information gathered by these surveys is used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to assess bird conservation priorities. Other conservation programs by the USFWS include the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Migratory Bird Conservation and the maintenance of 5 wildlife refuges at Cabo Rojo, Laguna Cartagena, Vieques, Culebra and Desecheo. Other institutions supporting bird conservation in Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican Ornithological Society and the Puerto Rico National History Association. Marine conservation has recently garnered support in Puerto Rico. The archipelago has an estimated 700 miles (1,126.5 km) of coastline and 1,300 mi2 (3,370 km2) of coral reef communities.Wilkinson, p. 435. The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components but only two of these (11 km2) are designated as no-take zones. All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico's waters are classified as either endangered or threatened. Earthwatch-supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and have contributed to the decline of egg-poaching and turtle meat consumption.

Many of his paintings concern traditionally Japanese subjects, particularly chickens and other birds. Many of his otherwise traditional works display a great degree of experimentation with perspective, and with other very modern stylistic elements. Compared to Soga Sh≈çhaku and other exemplars of the mid-Edo period eccentric painters, Jakuch≈´ is said to have been very calm, restrained, and professional. He held strong ties to Zen Buddhist ideals, and was considered a lay brother (koji); but he was also keenly aware of his role within a Kyoto society that was becoming increasingly commercial. Biography Grave of It≈ç Jakuch≈´, Kyoto It≈ç Jakuch≈´ was the eldest son of It≈ç Genzaemon, a Kyoto grocer whose shop, called Masuya, lay in the center of downtown, in the Nishiki food district. Jakuch≈´ ran the shop from the time of his father's death in 1739 until 1755, when he turned it over to one of his brothers. His training in paintings was mostly derived from inspirations from nature and training under Kano school„Äå‰ºäËó§Ëã•ÂÜ≤„ÅÆÂàùÊúüÁµµÁîªËÄÉ<Áâ°‰∏π„ÉªÁôæÂêàÂõ≥>„Çí‰∏≠ÂøÉ„Å´„Äç„ÄéÂì≤Â≠¶‰ºöË™å„ÄèÁ¨¨29Âè∑„ÄÅÂ≠¶ÁøíÈô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶Âì≤Â≠¶‰ºö„ÄÅÂ±±Âè£ÁúüÁêÜÂ≠ê 2005Âπ¥ and from examining Japanese and Chinese paintings at Zen temples. Some sources indicate that he may have studied with ≈åoka Shunboku, an Osaka-based artist known for his bird and flower paintings. Though a number of his paintings depict exotic or fantastic creatures, such as tigers and phoenixes, it is evident from the detail and lifelike appearance of his paintings of chickens and other animals that he based his work on actual observation. Jakuch≈´ built a two-story studio on the west bank of the Kamo River in his late thirties. He called it Shin'en- kan (ÂøÉÈÅ†È§®, Villa of the Detached Heart [or Mind]), after a phrase from a poem by the ancient Chinese poet Tao Qian. It was around this time that Jakuch≈´ befriended Daiten Kenj≈ç, a Rinzai monk who would later become abbot of the Kyoto temple Sh≈çkoku-ji. Through this friendship Jakuch≈´ gained access to the temple's large collection of Japanese and Chinese paintings, and gained introduction to new social and artistic circles. It is thought that Daiten may have been the one to first conceive of the name \\"Jakuch≈´\\", taken from the Tao Te Ching and meaning \\"like the void\\". Well-known and well-reputed in the Kyoto art community, Jakuch≈´ received many commissions for screen paintings, and was at one time featured above a number of other notable artists in the Record of Heian Notables (Âπ≥ÂÆâ‰∫∫Áâ©Ë™å, '). In addition to personal commissions, Jakuch≈´ was also commissioned to paint panels or screens for many Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines across Japan, including the very famous and important Rokuon-ji (the monastery which includes the Kinkaku-ji Golden Pavilion on its grounds). Despite his commercial successes, however, Jakuch≈´ can definitely be said to have lived the life of a literary intellectual ('). He was friends with many notable ', went on journeys with them, and was influenced by their artistic styles. His own degree of experimentation was a result of a combination of this ' influence and his own personal creative drive. In addition to his experiments with Western materials and perspective, Jakuch≈´ also employed on occasion a method called ' (ÊãìÁâàÁîª, \\"rubbing prints\\"). This method used woodblocks to resemble a Chinese technique of ink rubbings of inscribed stone slabs, and was employed by Jakuch≈´ in a number of works, including a scroll entitled \\"Impromptu Pleasures Afloat\\" (‰πóËààËàü, J≈çky≈çsh≈´), depicting a journey down the Yodo River. Despite his individualism and involvement in the scholarly and artistic community of Kyoto, Jakuch≈´ was always strongly religious, and retired towards the end of his life to Sekih≈ç-ji, a Manpuku-ji branch temple on the southern outskirts of Kyoto. There, he gathered a number of followers, and continued to paint until his death at the age of eighty- five. Works Old Pine Tree and White Phoenix. Part of the series '''' Rooster and Hen with Hydrangeas. A very common theme among his work is birds, in particular hens and roosters, though several of his more famous paintings depict cockatoos, parrots, and phoenixes. One of his most ambitious endeavors, and therefore most famous works, is known as the \\"Pictures of the Colorful Realm of Living Beings\\" (ÂãïÊ§çÁ∂µÁµµ, '). Begun around 1757 and not finished until 1765, the Pictures are a set of twenty-seven hanging scrolls created as a personal offering to the Sh≈çkoku-ji temple.

The piece, one of a pair of sixfold screens, depicts a white elephant and a number of other animals in a garden. What makes it unique, eccentric and modern is the division of the entire piece into a grid of squares (or, in modern terms, the painting is \\"pixelated\\") roughly a centimeter on each side.

He was the most successful financially of the trio, becoming a multi-millionaire by 1898 and buying a large Victorian mansion for his family when they moved about that time to Berkeley, California. He was the first president of the Alaskan Order of Yukon Pioneers and also belonged to the Yukon Order of Pioneers. He wrote a memoir, Recollections of Leroy N. McQuesten, Life in the Yukon 1871-1885, which was published posthumously in 1952. Biography Leroy Napoleon McQuesten (called \\"Jack\\") was born in 1836 in Litchfield, New Hampshire to a family of Scots-Irish descent. His family moved to Illinois in the 19th- century westward migration, and then to California by the time he was 13. He was there for the gold rush. McQuesten joined other adventurers in the Yukon, becoming partners with traders Arthur Harper, an immigrant from northern Ireland, and Alfred Mayo, of Irish descent from Bangor, Maine. Together the three founded the trading post of Fort Reliance in the Yukon. Later, Dawson City developed six miles upriver of their post. Their post was such a point of reference, that prospectors both up and downriver named creeks and rivers in reference to their distance from Fort Reliance, as in Sixtymile River and Fortymile River. McQuesten and his two partners each married native Athabascan women of the Koyukon people, strengthening their ties among the local culture. In 1874 Harper married a young woman he called Jeannine, who had not gone to a mission school and preferred to teach her children traditional ways. The three trading partners moved to Tanana after 1875, where they set up another trading post near the Athabascan village of Nuklukayet. In 1878 McQuesten married Satejdenalno (1860‚Äì1921). She was from Kokrines village, about 80 miles west. She had attended the Russian mission school, as had her cousin Margaret, whom Mayo married. Satejdenalno became known as Katherine (or Kate) James McQuesten. Fluent in Koyukon, Russian, and English, she often acted as an intermediary for her husband and his partners in communications with the local natives. She was an important player in their business affairs, and they also had several children together.\\"Leroy Napoleon (Jack) McQuesten\\", Alaska Mining Hall of Fame, accessed 30 June 2014 In 1879, McQuesten was hired by the Alaska Commercial Company to manage their trading post. McQuesten had helped found the Alaskan Order of Yukon Pioneers, and was its first elected president. He also belonged to the Yukon Order of Pioneers, as did Mayo. Their motto was the Golden Rule: \\"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you\\".Gaffin, Jane. (2004) \\"The Trading Trio of Arthur Harper, Al Mayo, and Jack McQuesten\\", Diarmani Website, accessed 30 June 2014 In 1894, McQuesten founded Circle City, Alaska, which developed the largest log cabin district in the North Country. He and Kate set up the Alaska Commercial Company in town. With the frenzy of the Klondike gold rush in 1897, he feared food shortages in Circle City and decided to leave Alaska. He bought some mining claims on Eldorado and Bonanza creeks in the Klondike district as late as 1898, and made a profit. The most successful financially of the trading partners with his various ventures, by 1898 he had become a multi-millionaire. McQuesten resettled with his family in Berkeley, California, where they purchased a large Victorian mansion for their big family. The youngest several children all attended school there, graduating from Berkeley High School. He wrote a memoir, Recollections of Leroy N. McQuesten, Life in the Yukon 1871-1885 (1952), which was published posthumously from his original manuscript held by the Yukon Order of Pioneers. Leroy N. McQuesten, Recollections of Leroy N.

As Prospect Reservoir forms a part of the Sydney metropolitan water supply, the flow of the creek is regulated in accordance with the operational requirements of Sydney Water. The creek is long, starting at the Prospect Reservoir at the top of the catchment and flows to the Georges River at Georges Hall, as its tributary. In 2020 a proposal was submitted to upgrade a 6 kilometre (4 mi) stretch of Prospect Creek river status. In September 2020, this proposal went before the Geographical Names Board of NSW (GNB) after Community Advocate Lachlan Hyde pushed the New South Wales Government on the matter. This section would then be named 'Lennox River' to honour Scottish-Australian stonemason David Lennox who designed and oversaw the construction of the Lansdowne Bridge which crosses this waterway. Course and features Prospect Creek rises below Prospect Reservoir, north of Bulls Hill in Prospect, within the Blacktown local government area, and flows generally southeast by east, through the Holroyd, Fairfield, Liverpool and Bankstown local government areas, before reaching its confluence with the Georges River, at Georges Hall, spilling into Dhurawal Bay in the Chipping Norton Lakes. The catchment area of the creek is approximately , and is largely urbanised with industrial land uses, residential and open space for recreation. Restrictions Fishing in Prospect Creek is closed to all recreational fishing traps. Penalties apply for not complying with fishing rules and regulations. Bull Sharks can be found in the creek as the Georges River is tidal up to the Liverpool Weir, and Prospect Creek connects below that point. As such, swimming is not recommended. Recreation The creek flowing under the Lansdowne Bridge, Lansdowne. The creek winds through a number of parks and reserves, with the most prominent ones being, Gipps Road Sporting Complex, Rosford Street Reserve and the contiguous Long Street Park in Smithfield, Fairfield Park Precinct and Cawarra Park in Fairfield, Fairfield Road Park in Yennora, Makepeace Oval in Fairfield and Henry Lawson Reserve in Georges Hall, going from northwest to southeast. It also flows on the western fringes of Fairfield High School and just north of Bland Oak, a historical tree. There are walkways or cycling paths that parallel the creek. The longest, continuous walking path that runs alongside creek starts from Widmere Road, adjacent to the Liverpool‚ÄìParramatta T-way, in the northern periphery of Wetherill Park, and ends at Fairfield Road Park in Yennora, opposite of Yennora Fire Station. The walkabouts are within the surroundings of the Australian bushland, which include native trees such as eucalyptus.King M & Associates (1997) Recreation Needs Assessment Study prepared for Fairfield City Council References External links * Creeks and canals of Sydney Hume Highway Georges River ","title":"Prospect Creek (New South Wales)"},{"id":"6419894","text":"Knocks may refer to: *Knocks (Aghalurcher), a townland in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland *Knocks (Clones), a townland in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland * The Knocks, an American electronic music duo See also * Knock (disambiguation) * Knox (disambiguation) * Nock (disambiguation) ","title":"Knocks"},{"id":"6419902","text":"Hochwald (Swiss German: Hobel) is a municipality in the district of Dorneck in the canton of Solothurn in Switzerland.

Characteristics Dentition. The anterior palatine foramina are longer than in other species in the genus. The brown palm civet has a uniformly brown pelage, darker around the head, neck, shoulder, legs, and tail. Sometimes the pelage may be slightly grizzled. Two subspecies have been described on the basis of the colour of the pelage although the colour is extremely variable, ranging from pale buff or light brown to dark brown. The dark tail sometimes has a white or pale-yellow tip. It has no distinct markings on the body or the face as in the Asian palm civet. A distinctive feature is the reversed direction of hair growth on the nape, similar to that in the golden palm civet (P. zeylonensis) of Sri Lanka. It is about as large as the common palm civet, but with a long and sleek tail. The body weight of the males ranges from , head and body length , and tail length from . The species was described in 1885 on the basis of a skull and pelt obtained in Kodaikanal by Mr F. Levinge and forwarded by Rev. S. B. Fairbank to Blanford. Blanford noted the long foramen on the anterior palate. He also found the pelt matching another specimen collected by Francis Day. Blanford named the species in honour of T. C. Jerdon. The subspecies caniscus was described by Reginald Innes Pocock on the basis of a specimen collected at Virajpet in southern Coorg. There are two subspecies, the nominate P. j. jerdoni and P. j. caniscus. The Sulawesi palm civet is sometimes referred to by the same English name due to its brown colour.  Distribution and habitat Brown palm civet in its natural habitat from Munnar, Kerala. The brown palm civet's distribution extends from the southern tip of Western Ghats in Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve to Castle Rock in Goa to the north. They are nocturnal, and not as rare as previously thought and sight records of the species in Kodaikanal and Ootacamund where they were earlier considered to be locally extinct are an indication of their ability to go unnoticed. The brown palm civet occurs in fragmented landscapes containing remnants of tropical rainforest amid commercially exploited land patches such as tea and coffee plantations. Their ability to persist in such landscapes depends on the occurrence of a diversity of fruit tree species in these areas such as shade trees in coffee plantations.  Ecology and behaviour  Brown palm civet resting in the fork of a tree branch in the Anamalai hills Brown palm civets are solitary and nocturnal. They rest during the day in day-bed sites, such as tree hollows, canopy vine tangles, Indian giant squirrel nests and forks of branches. The day-bed trees are large and are usually in dense mature forest stands with high canopy connectivity. They sometimes rest in the night in open branches.  Diet  Brown palm civet feeding on a fig The brown palm civet is a key mammalian seed disperser in the Western Ghats rainforest by being predominantly frugivorous and dispersing a diverse array of plant species. Fruits form a large proportion (97 per cent) of its diet and more than 53 native and four introduced species of plants have been recorded. The diet patterns vary across years and even within the same year. They adapt to climatic variations in fruit availability by feeding on a diverse range of species of invertebrates and vertebrates. They eat fruits of trees and lianas, rarely those of herbs or shrubs. The diet is mostly composed of small (<1 cm diameter), many seeded, pulpy berries, and drupes with moderate to high water content, along with several large (>2 cm) fruits like Palaquium ellipticum, Elaeocarpus serratus, Holigarna nigra, and Knema attenuata. They have also been recorded feeding on flowers such as those of Cullenia exarillata and Syzygium species.  Conservation  Because of its large range and presence within several protected areas it has been classified as being of low conservation concern. However, these areas often do not have large mammalian dispersers and birds like hornbills and large pigeons due to habitat loss and hunting. Hence, the brown palm civet gains importance in such human-impacted landscapes as an important disperser and maintains biodiversity.

A member of the black-billed wedge-tailed Thyellodroma group, among the larger shearwaters of the genus Ardenna, it forms a superspecies with the wedge-tailed shearwater (A. pacificus).Carboneras (1992), Austin (1996), Austin et al. (2004), Penhallurick & Wink (2004) Description Migrating bird in Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary offshore California, United States; note upperwing pattern Adults birds are 46‚Äì47 cm in length, with a 97‚Äì to 99-cm wingspan, and have been recorded to weigh 342-425 g. The upperside of Buller's shearwater is bluish grey. A blackish stripe runs from the tertiary remiges to the primary wing coverts. The primary remiges are blackish, also; the two black areas do not meet at the hand, however; the area between them is a rather light grey, and under bright light may appear almost white. With the bird facing upwards, the pattern gives the impression of a broken black \\"M\\", with light grey interspersing areas.Carboneras (1992) The underside is bright white; on the head the upperside's grey extends town to eye height and the white cheeks may shine up conspicuously, as in the smaller shearwaters of Puffinus sensu stricto. The rectrices are blackish and the tail is wedge-shaped; the bill and irises are dark. Fledged juveniles already have the adult's colouration; the nestlings are covered in grey down feathers. Compared to other shearwaters, the species is unusually easy to identify at sea by its combination of considerable size and the distinctive, M-shaped banding pattern on its upperside while flying, uniquely among its genus and more akin to some gadfly petrels (Pterodroma), the prions (Pachyptila) and their relative, the blue petrel (Halobaena caerulea). These are all much smaller birds, perhaps two-thirds in length and wingspan and less than half in bulk of Buller's shearwater. Range and ecology This species is pelagic like the other Ardenna shearwaters; it is a transequatorial migrant ranging across most of the Pacific Ocean outside the breeding season. Though it occurs in the subarctic waters off Kamchatka and the Aleutian Islands, it is not documented in the subantarctic Pacific; this apparent absence might simply be due to the lack of study opportunities in the vast islandless region south of the Polynesian Triangle, however. It is fairly common well off the west coast of the United States during late summer and early autumn, and can generally be observed not far from land along the whole temperate and tropical coastlines of the Americas. Its general absence from most of Melanesia and western Micronesia - where human settlement and sea traffic are considerable - is thus probably genuine; only isolated records, such as from the Marianas, Palau, and Yap, exist from west and southwest of the Marshall Islands.Wiles et al. (2004) A vagrant bird was also recorded in the Atlantic once, offshore New Jersey, United States. Buller's shearwater feeds mainly on fish, squid, and crustaceans such as the krill Nyctiphanes australis. It does occasionally follow ships, such as fishing trawlers, and may be part of a mixed-species feeding flock. Food is caught mainly at a head's length below the surface at most, the bird either picking it up with the bill only, often out of flight, or briefly inserting the entire head, usually while swimming. It neither dives out of flight very often, nor in a plunge off the water's surface. It is a colonial nester, breeding predominantly on Tawhiti Rahi and Aorangi, the main islands of the Poor Knights group offshore northern New Zealand. This bird nests in burrows, rock crevices, or under tree roots, preferring densely forested slopes. Buller's shearwater can also be found to breed in cracked-up rock on treeless stacks or cliffs, however, and most of the other colonies - on the smaller Poor Knights islands between the main islands and off the southeast of Aorangi - are of such a nature. A pair was observed to breed on the Simmonds Islands in 1980,IUCN (2008) but this seems to have been an isolated incident. The breeding season starts in October and lasts for almost half a year. A single egg is incubated for about 51 days, with the parents changing between incubation and feeding every 4 days or so. Time to fledging is not well known, but by analogy with Buller's shearwater's relatives assumed to be around 100 days. In the past, it was heavily used as a food source by the MƒÅori, and on Aorangi it suffered massive predation by feral pigs. Its population had crashed to a low of just 100-200 pairs on Aorangi in the late 1930s. The pigs were removed from the island in 1936, and the shearwater population recovered, numbering 200,000 pairs again in the early 1980s to approach carrying capacity on the island at the end of the 20th century. At all times, however, the colonies at Tawhiti Rahi and on the smaller islets could supply birds for the resettlement of Aorangi, and Buller's shearwater was never considered threatened with extinction in the foreseeable future. Indeed, it is a very abundant bird, with an estimated world population of 2.5 million birds. As it is not known to occur on any larger island in the region outside the Poor Knights Islands, it is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN: a single localized catastrophe could wipe the species out.Carboneras (1992), IUCN (2008) See also * Seabird colony References Further reading * Austin, Jeremy J.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 19, 2006. In this episode, Lois discovers that Chris' school has removed the sex education program due to budget cuts and decides to bring the class back by becoming the teacher. Unfortunately, she gets fired a short time later for teaching the students about safe sex rather than abstinence. Meanwhile, Stewie attempts to find and kill the Tooth Fairy after being told \\"horror\\" stories by Brian. The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by James Purdum. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore, Mindy Cohn, Gary Cole, Taylor Cole, Lauren Conrad, David Cross, Margaret Easley, Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, Kevin Michael Richardson, Andr√© Sogliuzzo and Crawford Wilson, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot As Lois finds Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She is replaced by a reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them. Peter, truly believing the anti-sex propaganda Meg brings home, starts wearing a chastity belt and refuses to have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in \\"ear sex\\" (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex \\"in the eyes of the Lord.\\" This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only as long as it is practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with Cleveland poking out the window and saying the line \\"Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!\\". Production and censorship Many scenes from the original episode were seen as vulgar and were removed from the television broadcast. One of the scenes removed was from the beginning of the episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as \\"retarded friend\\" (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird-tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the \\"choose your own ending\\" text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set. In addition to the regular cast, actors Drew Barrymore, Mindy Cohn, Gary Cole, Taylor Cole, Lauren Conrad, David Cross, Margaret Easley, Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, Kevin Michael Richardson, Andr√© Sogliuzzo and Crawford Wilson guest star in the episode. Recurring guest voices include Lori Alan, Alex Breckenridge, Steve Callaghan, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, John Viener, and Adam West, who has a role of an exaggerated version of himself. Cultural references As Lois is informed the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims \\"Oh, no!\\", a cut-a-way scene then begins of a sports car driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to Knight Rider. When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from SpongeBob SquarePants, Starscream (from The Transformers) and Man-E-Faces, all of which are fictional characters for television programs. When Peter is watching television, he is watching Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County; the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show. When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused. The scene cuts to Michael Jackson in his childhood form eating a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats, saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a bust of William Shakespeare and a Rainbow Brite doll to demonstrate sexual intercourse. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie Airplane!. While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that CSI is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's bulimia, he mentions the death of singer Karen Carpenter, who died from anorexia in 1983. When Stewie thinks that Brian is the Tooth Fairy, Brian substantiates his identity by telling Stewie he has a picture of Chris Noth in his wallet, known for his role on Law & Order. Reception In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, tying with The Simpsons, while still winning over American Dad!. Although the episode received little positive reception, it was given a positive review by IGNs Dan Iverson, who noted that its plot had \\"great satire of the issue of sex education vs. abstinence\\". He also stated that \\"the random flashback jokes are often what are most memorable about each episode\\". He gave the episode a rating of 7.8 out of 10. In his review of Family Guy, volume 5, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode \\"a smart jab at the conservative Christian approach to sex education\\", and stated that \\"the effect it has on Meg, as well as Peter, is great\\".

Background As part of the British expedition to the Chesapeake Bay in the middle of 1814, a naval force under Commodore James Alexander Gordon was ordered to sail up the Potomac River and attack Fort Washington. The raid was supposed to be a demonstration, to distract American troops from the main British attack on Washington under General Robert Ross. Fort Washington was located on the Maryland shore, about below Washington. It was the only fortification on the Potomac River. Although it mounted twelve or fifteen guns (later increased) which commanded the river below its position, the American Brigadier General William H. Winder, commanding the military district around Washington, feared that a determined naval force could nevertheless blast its way past the fort. It would then have Washington at its mercy. A survey the previous year also noted that the fort blockhouse was only able to resist musket fire, and could be destroyed by a cannon as small as a twelve-pounder.Howard, pp.151-152 Its garrison consisted of 49 men under Captain Samuel T. Dyson of the United States Army's Corps of Artillery and elements of the U.S. 9th and 12th Infantry Regiments. British advance Gordon's force consisted of the frigates Seahorse of 38 guns, and Euryalus of 36 guns, the bomb vessels Devastation, Aetna and Meteor, each mounting two large mortars and eight or ten smaller guns and carronades, and the rocket vessel Erebus.Roosevelt, p.176 Starting on August 20, Gordon's ships spent several days working over the Kettle Bottom Shoals. Gordon later claimed all his ships grounded twenty times.Forester, p.182 On August 27, his bomb vessels opened fire on Fort Washington. Captain Dyson, in command of the fort, had been ordered by Brigadier General Winder to demolish the fort only if outflanked and attacked from the rear by large numbers of British troops. Winder also deployed about 500 militia to defend the fort.Elting, p.206 However, after Gordon had bombarded the fort for two hours,Howard, p.213 Dyson spiked his own guns, blew up the fort and its magazine containing 3000 pounds of gunpowder and retreated. He was subsequently relieved of command and placed under house arrest. A court martial found him guilty of abandoning his post and destroying government property and he was dismissed from the service.warburton.htm Gordon's report on the bombardment stated that: > A little before sunset the squadron anchored just out of gunshot; the bomb > vessels at once took up their position to cover the frigates in the > projected attack at daylight next morning and began throwing shells until > about 7:00 pm. The garrison, to our great surprise, retreated from the fort; > and a short time afterward Fort Washington was blown up. Occupation With the fall of Fort Washington, there was nothing to stop the advance of the British warships on the prosperous port of Alexandria, which lay only a few miles upriver. The town's Common Council had earlier sent a delegation to offer the city's surrender to Rear Admiral George Cockburn, who was occupying Washington.white-house-landing.htm On the morning of 28 August, the Mayor of Alexandria, Charles Simms, was rowed down river under a white flag to ask Gordon for terms for the surrender of the town. It being Sunday, Gordon told Mayor Simms to return to Alexandria and he would bring up his squadron on Monday. In the subsequent Congressional Investigative Committee report on the burning of the capital and the surrender of Alexandria, the town's clerk, Israel Thompson, submitted the following account: > On the morning of the next day, to wit the 29th of August, [the British > squadron] arranged itself along the town, so as to command it from one > extremity to the other. The force consisted of two frigates, to wit: the > Seahorse, rating thirty-eight guns, and Euryalus, rating thirty-six guns; > two rocket ships, of eighteen guns each; two bomb-ships, of eight guns each; > and a schooner of two guns, which were but a few hundred yards from the > wharves, and the houses so situated that they might have been laid in ashes > in a few minutes. To avoid destruction of the town, the Council agreed to hand over all merchant ships, even those which had been scuttled to prevent them being captured, and merchandise. The British thus acquired twenty-two merchant ships and vast quantities of loot, including flour, cotton, tobacco, wines and cigars.Elting, p.223 The delays caused by the shallow water conditions on the Potomac resulted in Gordon's squadron arriving off Fort Washington nearly a week after Ross' troops had entered and left the city of Washington. Having accomplished his primary objective of silencing Fort Washington, and learning that the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard had been burned a week earlier, Gordon decided not to proceed any further and rejected any suggestion that he take his squadron further up river to burn the docks at Georgetown. His presence in Alexandria nevertheless almost paralysed Washington and the American government, which was trying to reassemble and resume its functions.Elting, pp.224-225 British withdrawal After the British had occupied Alexandria for three days, the Cruizer class brig-sloop Fairy reached Gordon with orders to rejoin the main British fleet in the Chesapeake under Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Gordon began his departure in stages, first sending the bomb-ketch Meteor and the sloop Fairy ahead on September 1, to reconnoiter. The remaining ships departed Alexandria on 2 September, but at White House Point encountered American Militia batteries on the shore. Commodore John Rodgers, with the crews of two frigates under construction (USS Guerriere and Java), twice tried to send fireships against Gordon's ships, but both attempts were foiled by British seamen in the squadron's launches and cutters. On August 31, Secretary of State James Monroe, in his capacity as acting Secretary of War, ordered an American field artillery battery to be hastily erected on the Virginia shore on the heights of present-day Fort Belvoir. (He had overruled Colonel Decius Wadsworth, who had first gathered the guns, and who resigned rather than take Monroe's orders.)Elting, pp.223-224 Adverse winds prevented the British ships passing the battery until the winds changed on 5 September. Gordon had his seamen shift the ballast in the bottoms of the ships so that the list to starboard allowed the port side guns to fire higher, and, after unleashing a \\"fulsome fire\\", the squadron was finally able to pass the battery in about one hour.Herrick (2005) p.168 Aftermath Gordon rejoined Cochrane on September 9. Although, the raid had been very successful in financial terms, the delays caused by the difficult navigation of the Potomac prevented him from supporting the attack on Washington. Cochrane had been forced to wait for Gordon for several days, partly in case Gordon required rescueForester, p.183 and also because Gordon's flotilla included most of the available bomb-ketches and rocket vessels in Cochrane's fleet. This delay gave the defenders of Baltimore time to reinforce their defences and allowed them to repulse the British attack on that city.

Nat-Hlaung Kyaung temple is one of the oldest temples in Bagan, and was built in the 11th century, during the reign of King Anawratha. Some historians believe the temple was built in the 10th century, during the reign of King Nyaung-u Sawrahan (also known as Taungthugyi). The temple was originally built for Hindu Burmese Indians of the 11th century, including merchants and Brahmins in the service of the king. Many structures of the original temple have disappeared, although the main hall remains. Originally, the temple contained statues of the 10 Avatars of Vishnu, including Gautama Buddha; however, today, only seven remain. The brick temple was isolated and unrepaired for many years, damaged by earthquakes. The temple is set on a square template with steep-rising upper terraces. It may have been built by Indian artisans brought into Bagan (Pagan), during the 10th century AD, to work on it and other temples. As the oldest temple in Bagan, its style influenced and inspired the numerous other Buddhist structures that followed.Paul Strachan (1990), Pagan: Art & Architecture of Old Burma, 2nd edition, Kiscadale Publications, Another legend states that the temple was built to store all the nat from other temples, so that Buddhism could get established in Bagan kingdom.

The episode originally broadcast on November 26, 2006. In the episode, Stewie's old friend and child actress, Olivia Fuller (voiced by Rachael MacFarlane) returns to Quahog. Stewie intends to sabotage what little is left of her career, but ends up falling in love with her, only for the relationship to end in ruins due to his personality. Meanwhile, Peter decides to make a chick flick after enjoying one he saw in the cinema with Lois. The episode was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and directed by Pete Michels. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.49 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore, Jeff Bergman, Dave Boat, Lizzy Caplan, Rachael MacFarlane and Stacey Scowley, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot Stewie discovers that his old friend, Olivia, a child actress, is coming to the end of her Hollywood career because her \\"Tasty Juice: Drink it then Convert it to Pee\\" advertisement campaign has been dropped. Olivia is now making an appearance at the Quahog mall to open a new store. Stewie decides to go the mall where he intends to ridicule her, but falls in love with her after seeing her again. Olivia, however, does not return the same feelings, so Stewie seeks advice from Brian on how to make Olivia like him. Brian and Stewie observe next-door neighbor Glenn Quagmire get his way by being mean to a woman, and Stewie comes to the conclusion that women respond to men who mistreat them. Stewie and Olivia begin to bond shortly afterward, and the two spend their time bonding by sitting in a park while eating ice cream. As they sit and eat their ice cream, they mock various people, such as a man smelling his own hand, a Jewish cowboy, a man who cuts his own hair, and an uptight and hardworking Asian man who is looking at his watch. They also go to a birthday party for one of Olivia's friends. Olivia introduces Stewie to her old friend, a child actor named Victor, and she obliges Stewie to get both of them punch, but a jealous Stewie only wishes Victor to go away. The couple begin to argue constantly, and their latest argument ends with them getting married. After the marriage, which Rupert officiates, their relationship does not get any better. Later, the couple decide to accompany Brian on a double-date with his girlfriend, Jillian. During the date, the pair continue to bicker throughout, leading to Stewie starting an argument with a person in the restaurant who asks him to be quiet. He feels the relationship is failing, but Brian encourages him to reconsider and Stewie agrees to return to Olivia. Returning to his playhouse to apologize and make up with her, Stewie discovers Olivia \\"cheating\\" on him with her friend Victor (although the two are just playing with silly putty). With the relationship over, a seemingly distraught Stewie leaves the playhouse, which he then sets on fire with both Olivia and Victor inside. Meanwhile, Peter watches a chick flick with Lois, and is deeply moved by it. After renting several other chick flicks, Peter decides to make one of his own with his friends, entitled Steel Vaginas. The plot stars Peter as a man who claims he does not care much for women until he meets \\"Vageena Hertz\\", played by Lois, who is also his own daughter in the film. After Vageena almost drowns when she goes swimming too soon after eating, she is rushed to the hospital, but dies of an angry hymen. The film ends and is received badly by Peter's friends due to its poor plot outline, structure and not making any sense. During the closing credits of the episode, Stewie talks with Brian about how he does not like women and relationships, he talks about how he wishes that he could do the same thing with the same sex so Brian says, \\"They do; it's called being gay.\\" to which Stewie replies, \\"Oh, that's what gay is? Oh, yeah, I could totally get into that.\\" Production Drew Barrymore reprised her role as Jillian. Many of the jokes used in the storyline of this episode were originally pitched for a subplot of this episode, which saw Stewie building a robot suit to make him look like an adult to woo Jillian's best friend Ana, but this particular subplot was never used. The scene showing a mayor advertising a 1980s-related CD was included in the original draft for the episode, and, as MacFarlane states, is one of the rare occasions that an act break that is unrelated entirely to the storyline can be included in an episode. Originally, the gag of Stewie using some of Brian's fur to pass it off as his pubic hair was going to be the only area of his body where he would tell Jillian about his hair, but MacFarlane states that the show was not allowed to mention only pubic hair, and had to steer to a different area on the body that would have hair too, if they wanted to include it. Broadcasting standards allowed the sketch where Peter says \\"before, women only made me cry through my penis,\\" as he states they \\"gave in.\\" Additionally, while on the version broadcast Lois dies of an angry hymen, on the DVD version she dies of a rotten vagina. In addition to the regular cast, actress Drew Barrymore, voice actor Jeff Bergman, voice actor Dave Boat, actress Lizzy Caplan, voice actress Rachael MacFarlane and actress Stacey Scowley guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, actress Alex Breckenridge, voice actor John G. Brennan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances.

The mountain is the heart of the Ring of Gullion and is the highest point in the county, with an elevation of . At the summit is a small lake and two ancient burial cairns, one of which is the highest surviving passage grave in Ireland. Slieve Gullion appears in Irish mythology, where it is associated with the Cailleach and the heroes Fionn mac Cumhaill and C√∫ Chulainn. It dominates the countryside around it, offering views as far away as Antrim, Dublin Bay and Wicklow on a clear day. Slieve Gullion Forest Park is on its eastern slope. Villages around Slieve Gullion include Meigh, Drumintee, Forkhill, Mullaghbawn and Lislea. The mountain gives its name to the surrounding countryside, and is the name of an electoral area within Newry and Mourne district. Geography The western slope; the lowlands between Mullagbane and Lislea and in the background The Ring of Gullion (Slievenacapple) Slieve Gullion is a steep-sided mountain with a flat top and a height of . It is the eroded remains of a Paleocene volcanic complex. It is surrounded by a ring dike known as the Ring of Gullion, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Slieve Gullion has been shaped by glaciation and exhibits a classic 'crag and tail' glacial feature. The 'tail', made up of glacial deposits, points south, ending at Drumintee. The geological formation was the first ring dike to be mapped, although its significance was not understood until similar structures had been described from Scotland. The rocks of the area are complex and have featured in international geological debate since the 1950s. The site has attracted geologists from all over the world and featured in theories to explain the unusual rock relationships. Some of these theories have now become an accepted part of geological science. Much of Slieve Gullion is covered with forest, heather, or raw stone, while 612 hectares of dry heath on the mountain has been designated a Special Area of Conservation, an Environmentally Sensitive Area, and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In July 2006, some areas of gorse were destroyed by a wildfire which may have been started deliberately. Traces of fields on the mountain's poor soil from farming in earlier times can still be seen. There is also evidence of past quarrying. Burial cairns The entrance to the passage tomb There are two burial cairns on top of the hill, on either side of a small lake. The southern one is a large passage tomb, the highest surviving passage tomb in Ireland. In 1961, a team of archaeologists explored the site and set up a 30-person camp near the summit.Collins, A.E.P., and B.C.S. Wilson. \\"The Slieve Gullion Cairns\\" in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology (1963). p.19. The tomb's cairn is 30 m (97 ft) wide and 5 m (16 ft) high. The chamber inside is 3.6 m (12 ft) wide, with a corbelled roof up to 4.3 m (14 ft) high. It contained three large blocks of stone seemingly used as basins, and fragments of human bone. Some bits of worked flint and a barbed-end arrowhead were also found, \\"the meager remnants that survived the centuries of tomb raiding\\".Collins, A.E.P. \\"The Slieve Gullion Passage-Grave Cairn\\".

Slieve Gullion at dusk from the west Hillwalking Slieve Gullion is popular with hillwalkers, with about 20,000 people climbing the hill every year. A road leads to a small carpark about halfway up the western side of the mountain. From there is a trail leading to the summit. There is also a waymarked trail from the northern side of the mountain. As there is no security on the mountainside, cars parked there are often broken into by thieves, and police have asked visitors not to leave valuables in cars.\\"Vigilance urged after Slieve Gullion Forest Park robberies\\". Newry Times. 22 August 2017.\\"Slieve Gullion Park theft prompts police investigation\\". Newry Times. 8 November 2013. On the eastern side of the mountain is Slieve Gullion Forest Park, which includes a visitors' centre, caf√©, playground, and the Giant's Lair Story Trail.Slieve Gullion Forest Park Mythology Slieve Gullion appears in Irish mythology. Fionn and the Cailleach In the tale known as The Hunt of Slieve Gullion, √Åine and her sister Milucra both seek after the legendary hero Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool). Knowing that √Åine vowed never to marry a man with grey hair, Milucra secretly puts a spell on the lake atop Slieve Gullion, so that anyone who swam in it would become elderly. She tricks Fionn by asking him to fetch her golden ring from the lake, and he emerges as an old man with grey-white hair. His men, the Fianna, force her to give him a restorative potion from her cornucopia. Fionn's youth returns, but his hair does not return to its true colour.Monaghan, Patricia. The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p.109 This is said to be the origin of his name, Fionn, meaning 'white'. In some versions of the tale, Milucra is revealed to be the Cailleach Bh√©ara (Calliagh Birra), an ancient goddess.Gregory, Isabella Augusta (Persse). Gods and Fighting Men. John Murray, 1904. pp. 306-09 The names of several features on the mountain refer to the Cailleach Bh√©ara. The passage grave is known as Calliagh Birra's House and the small lake is called Calliagh Birra's Lough. Lower down, on a hillock called Spellick, is a rock feature called the Calliagh Birra's Chair. Locals would visit it at Lughnasadh and take turns sitting on the chair.Tempan, Paul. Irish Hill and Mountain Names. MountainViews.ie. C√∫ Chulainn Slieve Gullion is said to be where the legendary hero C√∫ Chulainn (Cuhullin) received his name and where he spent his childhood as S√©tanta. According to myth, the mountain is named after Culann the metalsmith. Culann invites Conchobhar mac Neasa, king of Ulster, to a feast at his house on the slopes of Slieve Gullion. On his way, Conchobhar stops at the playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so impressed by S√©tanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. S√©tanta promises to join him after he finishes his game. Conchobhar goes ahead, but he forgets about S√©tanta, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to guard his house. When S√©tanta arrives, the hound attacks him, but he kills it; in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so S√©tanta promises to rear him a replacement, and until it was old enough to do the job, he himself would guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbhadh announces that his name henceforth would be C√∫ Chulainn, \\"Culann's Hound\\". In the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge, the nearby Gap of the North is where C√∫ Chulainn single-handedly fends-off the army of queen M√©abh.Gribben, Arthur. \\"T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge: A Place on the Map, A Place in the Mind\\".

The episode originally broadcast on December 17, 2006. The plot sees Meg developing an obsession with Brian after he accompanies her as her date for the Junior Prom, eventually leading to her kidnapping Brian in order to rape him. Meanwhile, Peter and his friends join the Quahog Police Department to assist Joe with his work, but find being a police officer is not always about action. The episode was written by Kirker Butler and directed by Zac Moncrief. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition from receiving criticism from the Parents Television Council. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore, Barclay DeVeau, Phil LaMarr, Kerrigan Mahan, Natasha Melnick, Garrett Morris, Tamera Mowry and Lisa Wilhoit. The episode won an Annie Award for \\"Writing in an Animated Television Production.\\" Plot Mayor Adam West deploys the entire Quahog Police Department to Cartagena, Colombia to search for Elaine Wilder (a fictional character from the film Romancing the Stone which he was watching), leaving Joe behind (as he was not deployed due to his disability and the fact that parts of Cartagena aren't wheelchair-accessible) with the police station's skeleton crew. Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire join the department to assist Joe. Meanwhile, Meg threatens to commit suicide because she does not have a date for her Junior Prom. Even her backup boy, Jimmy, managed to avert going to the prom with her by shooting his little brother and having to attend his funeral. As a last resort, Brian agrees to take her to the prom. He gets drunk there, defends Meg by insulting Connie D'Amico about her inevitable future, and the two make out. After the dance, Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend, despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian. Meg develops an obsession with Brian, even baking him a pie and using her hair as one of the ingredients. Stewie arrives and sits next to Brian and asks if he can have some pie. He then asks for the \\"Cool Hwip\\" (this is the first in a series of occasions where Stewie puts emphasis on the \\"h\\" sound in a word starting with \\"wh\\"). Brian soon works up the courage to tell Lois that he and Meg kissed. Lois gets enraged at the news, and orders Brian to straighten it out. Brian goes up to Meg's room and tells her he's not attracted to her. However, Meg refuses to take \\"No\\" for an answer. Later that night, she knocks Brian out, puts him in the trunk of his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with packaging tape and is about to rape him. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) \\"I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her.\\" This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says \\"Soon it'll all become clear\\", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, and it turns out that all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the hwip (with emphasis on the \\"h\\") and Quagmire responds with disbelief. During the credits, Tom Tucker reports that the Quahog Police have called off the search for Elaine Wilder and are heading back to Quahog. Production Kirker Butler wrote the episode. A scene shows Cleveland falling out of the bathtub and subsequently out of his house. This is the second time the show has used this gag (as indicated when Cleveland comments that \\"I gotta stop taking baths during Peter's shenanigans\\"), the first one being \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\", where Peter blew up Cleveland's house with a tank. This gag occurred three more times in the seventh season episodes \\"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing\\" and \\"Family Gay\\", the season eight episodes \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\", \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\", and the Cleveland Show pilot. It took several attempts to animate it correctly. The gag of Meg's Junior Prom date killing his brother in order to escape from their planned date was included in the first draft for the episode, as made by Kirker Butler. A scene featuring Peter, Cleveland, Mort and Quagmire drinking coffee in the booth, waiting for one of them to act irrationally due to Joe adding a substance into their drink, was cut from the broadcast for timing purposes. A deleted scene had been made for the episode, which showed one of the characters present in the booth after Joe added a substance into their drink, turning into a lizard-like creature from Jurassic Park, but the gag was never used. When Brian is explaining the situation with Meg to Lois in the uncensored version he says \\"this morning she made me eat the hair in her pie\\" Broadcast standards objected to this and it was changed for air to \\"hair pie\\". On the DVD commentary MacFarlane remarked he thought the latter sounded more offensive. American actor and comedian Garrett Morris guest-starred on the episode, portraying the headmaster of the \\"New York School for the Hard-of- Hearing\\", which was once a regular Weekend Update piece on the 1970s episodes of Saturday Night Live. When Peter and everybody else discover Meg attempting to seduce Brian in the hotel, Peter uses the term \\"Chinaman\\"; this was changed for the television broadcast to \\"oriental guy\\", as \\"Chinaman\\" is deemed to be an offensive word. In addition to the regular cast, actress Drea Barrymore, voice actor Barclay DeVeau, voice actor Phil LaMarr, voice actor Kerrigan Mahan, actress Natasha Melnick, comedian and actor Garrett Morris, actress Tamera Mowry and actress Lisa Wilhoit guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, actress Alex Breckenridge, voice actor John G. Brennan, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Patrick Warburton and Adam West made appearances as well. Cultural references The movie Mayor West is watching on the television is Romancing the Stone. The music played in the background during the black people's parade is taken almost verbatim from the film adaptation of the 1975 musical The Wiz where, in the final number of the film, they sing \\"Brand New Day\\" when it came to the absence of most of the Quahog Police Department. The two songs playing in the background at the junior prom are \\"Hold On to the Nights\\" by Richard Marx and \\"Why\\" by Annie Lennox. The music used in the background and the academy's logo when Peter, Quagmire and Cleveland are entering the police training grounds is a reference to that used in the Police Academy. The scene where Meg plays Madame Butterfly while turning the lamp on and off and the line \\"I will not be ignored, Brian\\" is a reference to the 1987 film Fatal Attraction. The entire scene in the hotel where Meg is discovered attempting to seduce Brian is a reference to The King of Comedy, which MacFarlane notes as one of his favorite movies. When Peter Griffin steals a giraffe from the zoo, he names the giraffe Allison Janney. Garrett Morris reprises his role as Headmaster of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing from the first season of Saturday Night Live. Reception In a significant decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.0 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, slightly being edged out by The Simpsons, while still winning over American Dad!. This episode was written by Kirker Butler, who was nominated at the 34th Annie Awards under the category of \\"Writing in an Animated Television Production\\", and Mila Kunis, who voices Meg, was also nominated for her work on this episode under the category of \\"Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production\\". In his review of the episode, Dan Iverson of IGN wrote: \\"After a couple more episodes like the one that Family Guy had on Sunday night, we could officially and unequivocally call the show the best animated program to air on the weekend\\", adding \\"we are completely willing to raise the once hit- or-miss comedy of Family Guy to the level of most consistently funny comedy on FOX Sunday nights ‚Äî and that is thanks to great stories and hilarious comedy like that of this week's episode \\"Barely Legal.\\" In a review of Family Guy, Volume five, Nancy Basile regarded \\"Airport '07\\", \\"Prick Up Your Ears\\", and \\"Barely Legal\\" as \\"gem episodes\\". Brett Love of TV Squad commented: \\"It seemed like more of a cohesive story than we have seen in a while as the whole family was tied in to the same storyline\\", later adding \\"I liked the story of Meg's infatuation with Brian\\", concluding with \\"overall, I'd call this one a really good episode.\\" However, the Parents Television Council, a media watchdog group and frequent critic, named \\"Barely Legal\\" the \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" ending the week of December 28, 2006. PTC member and writer Joey Bozell commented, \\"It's becoming more and more obvious that these writers' missions is to provide the most offensive content they can imagine and in turn proves they don't have an ounce of respect for the families watching at home.\\" References External links  Family Guy (season 5) episodes 2006 American television episodes ","title":"Barely Legal (Family Guy)"},{"id":"6420210","text":"Hologram of Baal is the eleventh album by the Australian alternative rock band The Church, released in September 1998. It was written and recorded following the full-time return of founding guitarist Peter Koppes, who had left the band in 1992 after the Priest=Aura tour. It was also the first album which the band had produced on their own and was recorded and mixed by their drummer Tim Powles. Album titles originally proposed by singer Steve Kilbey included Bastard Universe and Hologram of Allah, but these were rejected as too inflammatory. In the end, the latter was amended with the name of a deity from the Canaanite pantheon and the former was used as the title of the bonus disc. The song \\"This Is It\\" is about the death of INXS front man and fellow Australian, Michael Hutchence. The bonus disc, Bastard Universe, included with the first pressings, contained a seemingly continuous 79 minute instrumental improvisation, divided into six \\"stages\\". The U.S. and U.K. pressings list only four \\"stages\\", although all six tracks are present on the CDs. The original Australian cover design, featuring a green, full-frame, pseudo- holographic image of a primitive mask, was heavily modified for the U.S. and U.K. releases. These feature a plain reddish-brown image of the mask, originally used inside the Australian booklet, placed to the right (U.S.) or left (U.K.) of a vertical black bar containing the band's name in large dark blue type.

It is a State Historic Site, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and became a National Historic Landmark in 2001. Built in 1807‚Äì1810 for the son of French colonists, it is an extremely rare example of Federal architecture in the upper Mississippi River valley. Nicholas Jarrot Nicholas Jarrot (1764‚Äì1820) was a fur trader, lawyer, county judge, businessman, and developer who owned 25,000 acres (100 km¬≤) of land at the peak of his success. He tried to lead and manage the transition of his community, originally citizens of the French colony of Louisiana, by the mid-18th century under rule by Great Britain, as it was transformed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries into what became known as the American Bottom. The east bank of the Mississippi River, including what is now southwestern Illinois, had been ceded by Great Britain to the United States following the American Revolution by the Treaty of Paris in 1783. As a pro-American merchant with business ties to the new republic, Jarrot was recommended to the westward-bound explorer Meriwether Lewis in 1803. Lewis met Jarrot in December of that year and won the merchant's permission to encamp his men on one of Jarrot's properties, a riverfront tract across from the mouth of the Missouri River. This winter encampment of 1803‚Äì1804 became Camp Dubois, the shakedown site of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Construction As a reflection of his business success and ability to fit in with the incoming English-speaking frontiersmen, Jarrot decided to construct an American-style house. The Jarrot Mansion was built to resemble the houses of successful families on the U.S. East Coast, rather than the French Colonial style that continued to be followed by the French-speaking community leaders in places such as Sainte Genevieve, Missouri. The mansion's springhouse The Jarrot Mansion was built by masons who were not used to working with bricks, and so its windows are slightly askew and the facade of the house is asymmetrical. The house and its facade have an appealing quirkiness, and appear to be more vernacular than the owner may have wished. The house was sturdily built, however, and survived the major 1811‚Äì12 New Madrid earthquakes that had their epicenter at New Madrid, Missouri. The mansion complex includes a spring house built of cut limestone. Spring houses like that of the Jarrot Mansion contained tubs of cool water in which foodstuffs were protected from spoilage for short periods of time. Preservation Mansion with porch in 1934 The Jarrot Mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. A predecessor agency to the IHPA acquired the house in 1980. The house was elevated to the rank of a National Historic Landmark in 2001. , the mansion is a largely inactive historic site. The IHPA keeps it closed to the public except for periodic seasonal open-house festivals. The Jarrot Mansion is located less than one-half mile from the Cahokia Courthouse State Historic Site, where Jarrot served as judge of St. Clair County.

The general solution of the electromagnetic wave equation in homogeneous, linear, time-independent media can be written as a linear superposition of plane-waves of different frequencies and polarizations. The treatment in this article is classical but, because of the generality of Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics, the treatment can be converted into the quantum mechanical treatment with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities (aside from the quantum mechanical treatment needed for charge and current densities). The reinterpretation is based on the theories of Max Planck and the interpretations by Albert Einstein of those theories and of other experiments. The quantum generalization of the classical treatment can be found in the articles on photon polarization and photon dynamics in the double-slit experiment.  Explanation  Experimentally, every light signal can be decomposed into a spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths associated with sinusoidal solutions of the wave equation. Polarizing filters can be used to decompose light into its various polarization components. The polarization components can be linear, circular or elliptical. Plane waves The plane sinusoidal solution for an electromagnetic wave traveling in the z direction is : \\\\mathbf{E} ( \\\\mathbf{r} , t ) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} E_x^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_y^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = E_x^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\hat {\\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\; + \\\\; E_y^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\hat {\\\\mathbf{y}} for the electric field and : c \\\\, \\\\mathbf{B} ( \\\\mathbf{r} , t ) = \\\\hat { \\\\mathbf{z} } \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} ( \\\\mathbf{r} , t ) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -E_y^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_x^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = -E_y^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\hat {\\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\; + \\\\; E_x^0 \\\\cos \\\\left ( kz-\\\\omega t + \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\hat {\\\\mathbf{y}} for the magnetic field, where k is the wavenumber, : \\\\omega_{ }^= c k \\\\omega is the angular frequency of the wave, and c is the speed of light.

The plane wave is parameterized by the amplitudes Electromagnetic radiation can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This diagram shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from right to left. The magnetic field (labeled M) is in a horizontal plane, and the electric field (labeled E) is in a vertical plane. : E_x^0 = \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid \\\\cos \\\\theta : E_y^0 = \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid \\\\sin \\\\theta and phases : \\\\alpha_x^, \\\\alpha_y where : \\\\theta \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\tan^{-1} \\\\left ( { E_y^0 \\\\over E_x^0 } \\\\right ) . and : \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2 \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\left ( E_x^0 \\\\right )^2 + \\\\left ( E_y^0 \\\\right )^2 . Polarization state vector Jones vector All the polarization information can be reduced to a single vector, called the Jones vector, in the x-y plane. This vector, while arising from a purely classical treatment of polarization, can be interpreted as a quantum state vector. The connection with quantum mechanics is made in the article on photon polarization. The vector emerges from the plane-wave solution. The electric field solution can be rewritten in complex notation as : \\\\mathbf{E} ( \\\\mathbf{r} , t ) = \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\bigl\\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\exp\\\\bigl[ i ( kz-\\\\omega t ) \\\\bigr] \\\\bigr\\\\\\\\} where : \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_y \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix} is the Jones vector in the x-y plane. The notation for this vector is the bra‚Äìket notation of Dirac, which is normally used in a quantum context. The quantum notation is used here in anticipation of the interpretation of the Jones vector as a quantum state vector. Dual Jones vector The Jones vector has a dual given by : \\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x^* & \\\\psi_y^* \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\quad \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( -i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) & \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( -i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\quad \\\\end{pmatrix} . Normalization of the Jones vector Linear polarization. A Jones vector represents a specific wave with a specific phase, amplitude and state of polarization. When one is using a Jones vector simply to indicate a state of polarization, then it is customary for it to be normalized. That requires that the inner product of the vector with itself to be unity: : \\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x^* & \\\\psi_y^* \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_y \\\\end{pmatrix} = 1 . An arbitrary Jones vector can simply be scaled to achieve this property. All normalized Jones vectors represent a wave of the same intensity (within a particular isotropic medium). Even given a normalized Jones vector, multiplication by a pure phase factor will result in a different normalized Jones vector representing the same state of polarization. Polarization states Elliptical polarization. Linear polarization In general, the wave is linearly polarized when the phase angles \\\\alpha_x^, \\\\alpha_y are equal, : \\\\alpha_x = \\\\alpha_y \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\alpha . This represents a wave polarized at an angle \\\\theta with respect to the x axis. In that case the Jones vector can be written : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha \\\\right ) . Elliptical and circular polarization The general case in which the electric field is not confined to one direction but rotates in the x-y plane is called elliptical polarization. The state vector is given by : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_y \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix} :: = \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha \\\\right ) \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\Delta \\\\alpha \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix} . In the special case of ŒîŒ±=0, this reduces to linear polarization. Circular polarization corresponds to the special cases of Œ∏=¬±œÄ/4 with ŒîŒ±=œÄ/2. The two circular polarization states are thus given by the Jones vectors: : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_y \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha \\\\right ) {\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\over 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pm i \\\\end{pmatrix} .

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 28, 2007. The episode follows Brian after he inadvertently sells Stewie's teddy bear, Rupert, during a yard sale. In an attempt to retrieve him, Stewie and Brian travel across the United States, eventually discovering he is with a child living in Aspen, Colorado. Meanwhile, Peter has his driving license revoked for careless driving and is forced to be driven around by Meg, which annoys him. The episode was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Dan Povenmire. It received divided reviews, with the negative reviews going to the \\"personal driver\\" plot and the positive going to the \\"Rupert\\" plot. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.8 million homes in its original airing. The episode feature guest performances by Max Burkholder, Phil LaMarr, Rob Lowe, Ted McGinley, Stephen Stanton, Connor Trinneer, Audrey Wasilewski, George Wendt and Dave Wittenberg. SpongeBob SquarePants voice actors Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke lent their voices to the episode as SpongeBob and Patrick respectively from archive music of the \\"Campfire Song Song\\" from the episode ‚ÄúThe Camping Episode‚Äù, but remain uncredited. Plot The Griffins have a yard sale to sell off household items that they no longer need, but Brian accidentally sells Stewie's teddy bear, Rupert, causing Stewie to think Rupert has been kidnapped. Brian takes Stewie to the toy store to try to find a replacement, but ends up admitting he accidentally sold it, after which Stewie exclaims: \\"You son of a bitch!\\". He attempts to retrieve Rupert by tracking DNA samples against the federal database from the money Brian was paid for Rupert. They discover the man who bought Rupert lives in Quahog, but upon arrival, they discover the house is deserted. After seeing the moving truck and following it, with Mayor West driving, they discover the man now resides in Aspen, Colorado, meaning West drives them no further, only stopping in the Connecticut state line. To get over the mountains, the pair rent a helicopter after discovering \\"to rent a helicopter, you can pay with cash, check, or a jaunty tune\\". Stewie then performs a dance for the man in the office (with help from Gene Kelly), but when Brian crashes the helicopter into the mountain, the two end up next to the entrance to Aspen. Refusing to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, voiced by Rob Lowe) and his family organize a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, they are allowed to take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can keep Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still need to get back to Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home. Meanwhile, Peter purchased his own Evel Knievel gloves at his own yard sale. He decides to use the family car to jump over a row of cars, but is unsuccessful and results in his drivers license being revoked by Joe. Lois arranges for Meg to become Peter's personal driver, and he makes numerous attempts to annoy Meg, including setting her hat on fire when traveling with his friends. When another car rear ends her and she is insulted by the driver, Meg takes out her repressed rage with Peter on the driver by beating him up; Peter is impressed, and the two bond in the car. In the end, Joe stops by Peter's house to reinstate his license. Meg worries that Peter will begin treating her badly again, but Peter says that while he will only do so in front of the family to keep up appearances, and that they will now be \\"secret best friends.\\" Production Dan Povenmire directed Road to Rupert and the previous \\"Road to\\" episodes \\"Rhode Island\\" and \\"Europe\\". This episode was written by Patrick Meighan, in his first episode of the season, and, like all Road to.. episodes from 2000‚Äì2007, directed by Dan Povenmire, in his second episode of the season. Lois mocking Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story (or, as it is called in the scene, Stymie Gruffin: The Untold Story), citing the movie as a middle finger to the audience by being three episodes slapped together under the guise of a movie (followed by Brian calling in two bodyguards in suits to take Lois away) was edited on TV for time reasons. A deleted scene showed one of Peter's crimes being a hate crime, where during his stunt he hit a car with a Jewish driver. The televised scene changed the Jewish driver to a female virgin driver and the crime being a rape (her airbag having busted her hymen when it deployed) and not a hate crime. The scene of Stewie getting high on NyQuil to cope with losing Rupert and mistaking a throw pillow for a cat was cut from TV airings for time reasons. David Goodman noted that he feels the production crew may not have succeeded on this episode as everything falls into place easily, such as the box falling out of the moving truck. Every frame when Stewie is dancing in a montage of Anchors Aweigh took a large amount of work to produce. The montage of Stewie and Brian visiting several U.S. states (all of which are states where there's nothing but cornfields) was a DVD exclusive scene, removed from television for timing purposes. This scene was partially based on series creator Seth MacFarlane traveling the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks and realizing there is much corn throughout the U.S. A deleted scene directly after the helicopter crash had shown Stewie saying \\"come here, puss\\" for a second time, but this was replaced with another. Stewie and Brian carjacking somebody was added to the episode in a later rewrite and censored on television. In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Max Burkholder, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actor Rob Lowe, actor Ted McGinley, voice actor Stephen Stanton, actor Connor Trinneer, voice actress Audrey Wasilewski, actor George Wendt (who voiced Norm Peterson in the episode) and voice actor Dave Wittenberg (who voiced Woody Boyd in the episode, originally played by Woody Harrelson) guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Cultural references When speaking with Brian at the yard sale, Lois comments that Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story is not a real movie, rather just three individual episodes together, but altering the title to Stymie Gruffin: The Untold Story when discussing it with Brian. The music performed at Stewie's vision of Rupert's funeral was the hymn Amazing Grace (played on the bagpipes by Brian), while the funeral itself is a reference to Spock's funeral in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The My Black Son opening theme parodied a number of 1970s and 1980s television programs, these being Diff'rent Strokes, Family Ties, Punky Brewster, Laverne and Shirley, Perfect Strangers, Three's Company, Who's the Boss? and Bosom Buddies. It also co- starred Emmanuel Lewis. After Peter crashes his car during his first car- jumping stunt, he refers to Matthew Broderick's car accident in Northern Ireland in 1987, in which two people died. Peter watches an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants in the car which features \\"The Campfire Song\\" performed in the actual episode. It had been written by Dan Povenmire for the original SpongeBob episode, but it was allowed in the episode as Nickelodeon gave Family Guy permission to reproduce the music. Hitchhiking to Colorado, Stewie and Brian catch a ride with Smokey and the Bandit co-stars and former couple Sally Field and Burt Reynolds. The entire scene of Stewie singing and dancing in order to secure rental of the helicopter is a reference to the 1945 musical film Anchors Aweigh. The reflection of the original character (Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry) can be seen on the floor. When Stewie and Brian crash the helicopter down the mountain and Brian visualizes Stewie as the devil, this is a reference to such a scene in Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The crash itself is caused by a sector whiteout. The Herman's Hermits song \\"I'm into Something Good\\" is heard during a sequence of Peter's time with Meg. During this same sequence, they go to a drive in and Peter sticks his head through the roof of the car. Meg then places Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm on his head in reference to the opening credits of The Flintstones. Reception In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 8.8 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.1 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, slightly edging out both The Simpsons and American Dad!. The episode received mixed comments from TV Squad, with Brett Love commenting that \\"the suspended license plot was a little thin, but that's forgivable given that this was the b-story for the episode, and there are only 22 minutes to work with.\\" Love comments positively on the Stewie and Brian relationship in the episode, commenting that, \\"the Stewie and Brian story is what made the episode for me. It was very well done, right down to the goofy little details.\\" IGN commented that, \\"...for Family Guy to have a great episode, it takes a good story and humorous \\"manatee\\" gags. \\"Road to Rupert\\" was able to deliver on both these fronts, with the majority of the episode's attention focused on Stewie and Brian's road story, meshed with many laugh out loud gags.\\" References External links  Family Guy (season 5) episodes 2007 American television episodes Road to...

The film is based on the opera Griffelkin by Lukas Foss. The film's title is a common euphemism for the word hell. The film premiered on October 3, 1999, as a part of The Wonderful World of Disney anthology series on ABC. Plot summary Satan, in the form of Ms. Beelzebub (Rhea Perlman), sends apprentice demon Griffelkin (Friedle) to Earth's surface to steal the soul of a hotshot young hockey player named Dave Heinrich (Lawrence), who aspires to be the youngest man to ever win the Stanley Cup. Dave and Griffelkin reach a very specifically-worded agreement whereby Dave's soul is forfeit in exchange for a Stanley Cup championship for the Delaware Demons (a thinly veiled version of the New Jersey Devils), which is Dave's team at the time. After the deal is done, however, Griffelkin also arranges for Dave to be traded to The Annapolis Angels, the last-place team in the league, allowing Griffelkin to fulfill his end of the bargain without actually allowing Dave to win the Stanley Cup himself. He later chooses to help Dave as revenge against Ms Beelzebub for her mean collapsible chair trick and because of his reformation, choosing to side with Good. An Angel named Gabrielle tells Griffelkin that Dave's soul can be saved if the Angels win the Stanley Cup. Dave then realizes that the only way to save his soul is to become a true team player and help his new teammates improve enough to defeat the Demons in the Stanley Cup finals. The Demons lose the Stanley Cup, The Angels win and the deal is off. Griffelkin decides to join Gabrielle, giving up his position as a demon to become an angel who tells him he has a few things he must do to earn his wings. Then Satan/Ms Beelzebub, enraged at her defeat and at Griffelkin for helping Dave win, madly goes back to Hell in a fit of rage.

Later sources claim he was a cruel tyrant, and in January of 238, a revolt erupted in North Africa. The Historia Augusta states: > \\"The Romans could bear his barbarities no longer‚Äîthe way in which he called > up informers and incited accusers, invented false offences, killed innocent > men, condemned all whoever came to trial, reduced the richest men to utter > poverty and never sought money anywhere save in some other's ruin, put many > generals and many men of consular rank to death for no offence, carried > others about in waggons without food and drink, and kept others in > confinement, in short neglected nothing which he thought might prove > effectual for cruelty‚Äîand, unable to suffer these things longer, they rose > against him in revolt.\\" Gordian I and Gordian II Some young aristocrats in Africa murdered the imperial tax-collector and then approached the regional governor, Gordian, and insisted that he proclaim himself emperor. Gordian agreed reluctantly, but as he was almost 80 years old, he decided to make his son joint emperor, with equal power. The senate recognized father and son as emperors Gordian I and Gordian II, respectively. Their reign, however, lasted for only 20 days. Capelianus, the governor of the neighboring province of Numidia, held a grudge against the Gordians. He led an army to fight them and defeated them decisively at Carthage. Gordian II was killed in the battle, and on hearing this news, Gordian I hanged himself. Gordian I and II were deified by the senate. Pupienus, Balbinus and Gordian III Meanwhile, Maximinus, now declared a public enemy, had already begun to march on Rome with another army. The senate's previous candidates, the Gordians, had failed to defeat him, and knowing that they stood to die if he succeeded, the senate needed a new emperor to defeat him. With no other candidates in view, on 22 April 238 they elected two elderly senators, Pupienus and Balbinus (who had both been part of a special senatorial commission to deal with Maximinus), as joint emperors. This choice was not popular with the people, however, and mobs threw stones and sticks at the new emperors. Therefore, Marcus Antonius Gordianus Pius, the thirteen-year-old grandson of Gordian I, was nominated as emperor Gordian III, holding power only nominally in order to appease the population of the capital, which was still loyal to the Gordian family. Pupienus was sent at the head of an army to face Maximinus, and Balbinus stayed in Rome. Meanwhile, Maximinus was also having problems. In early February, he reached the city of Aquileia, to find that it had declared for his three enemies. Maximinus besieged the city, but without success. By April, discontent due to this failure, the lack of success in the campaign in general, lack of supplies and the strong opposition of the senate, forced his legionaries to rethink their allegiance. Soldiers of the II Parthica killed Maximinus in his tent, along with his son Maximus (who had been appointed deputy emperor in 236), and surrendered to Pupienus at the end of June. Maximinus' and his son's corpses were decapitated and their heads carried to Rome. For saving Rome from a public enemy, the soldiers were pardoned and sent back to their provinces. The co-emperor then returned to Rome, only to find the city in riot. Balbinus had not managed to control the situation, and the city had burned in a fire, resulting in mutiny. With both emperors present, the situation calmed down, but the unease remained. Coins from their reign show one of them on one side and two clasped hands on the other to show their joint power, yet their relationship was clouded with suspicion from the start, with both fearing assassination by the other. They were planning an enormous double campaign, Pupienus against the Parthians and Balbinus against the Carpians (Grant says against the Goths and the Persians, respectively), but they quarreled frequently and could not agree or trust each other. It was during one of these heavy discussions, in May or on July 29, that the Praetorian Guard decided to intervene. They stormed into the room containing the emperors, seized them both, stripped them, dragged them naked through the streets, tortured and eventually murdered them. On the same day, Gordian III was proclaimed sole emperor (238‚Äì244), though in reality his advisors exercised most of his power. Together Pupienus and Balbinus had ruled for only 99 days.

He was played by Abe Vigoda. Fish was an odd character for a television detective: aged, grumpy, and suffering from a variety of maladies for which he constantly needed medication. The most recurring malady was inflamed hemorrhoids where he would bring a donut cushion to his desk chair. The detectives' bathroom was as important to him as his desk. Fish's wife was Bernice, played by Florence Stanley, who made occasional visits to the squad room and whose name the aging Fish once forgot during breakfast. After retiring from the 12th precinct at age 63 and 38 years of service, the character of Fish became the center of his own series, Fish, in which he and his wife served as foster parents for a number of troubled children, referred to euphemistically as PINS, or \\"persons in need of supervision\\". His successor at the precinct was Det. Arthur P. Dietrich. Fish visited the 12th precinct once more after his retirement from the force and the end of the series Fish (in the episode \\"Lady and the Bomb\\"), but it proved to be a bit of a let-down for him.

It is made of 100% plastic, compared with wood-plastic composite lumber. Widely employed in outdoor decking, it is also used for molding and trim and garden furniture such as park benches. Resistant to cracking and splitting when appropriately installed, plastic lumber can be molded with or without simulated wood grain details. Even with a wood grain design, PL is still easy to distinguish visually from natural timber: the grains are the same uniform color as the rest of the material. Manufacturers claim plastic lumber is more environmentally-friendly and requires less maintenance than wood/plastic composites or rot-resistant wood. Unlike wood-plastic composite lumber, plastic lumber is 100% recyclable after its original intended use. Production Plastic lumber is composed of virgin or waste plastics including HDPE, PVC, PP, ABS, PS and PLA. The powder or pellets are mixed to a dough-like consistency at roughly and then extruded or molded to the desired shape. Additives such as colorants, coupling agents, stabilizers, blowing agents, reinforcing agents, foaming agents, and lubricants help tailor the end product to the target application. The material is formed into both solid and hollow profiles or into injection molded parts and products. Resin, regrind, and most of the additives are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder. The new material pellets are formed in a mold and cooled. Pre- distribution testing can help determine the optimal combination of chemical agents, design, agitation, and other flow aid strategies for the specific material in use. Modern testing facilities are available to evaluate materials and determine the optimal combination of equipment components to assure the highest level of accuracy and reliability. Computerized performance test reports document equipment performance. Properties Plastic lumber can be molded to meet almost any desired spatial condition, a major advantage over wood. It can also be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Plastic lumber works like wood - it can be shaped, drilled, and cut using conventional woodworking tools. At the same time, it is waterproof and resists all types of rot and mold, although it is not as rigid as wood and may slightly deform in extremely hot weather. Plastic lumber is not sensitive to staining from a variety of agents. A major selling point of this material is it doesn't need to be painted and is overall low-maintenance. It is manufactured in a variety of colors, and is widely available in grays and earth tones. Engineering properties While the compressive properties of plastic lumber are equal or greater than those of wood, the modulus of elasticity is very low. Moreover, plastic lumber is subject to far more creep than wood. Use in load-bearing structures requires different considerations from wood. Plastic lumber can present issues with fire containment: it performed worse than a variety of wood and composite materials in a test. Plastic lumber also deforms easily at high temperature, planning for the event of fire needs to take this into account. Standards ASTM has developed seven standard test methods to measure the properties of PL: * D 6108, Standard Test Method for Compressive Properties of Plastic Lumber and Shapes; * D 6109, Standard Test Method for Flexural Properties of Unreinforced and Reinforced Plastic Lumber; * D 6111, Standard Test Method for Bulk Density and Specific Gravity of Plastic Lumber and Shapes by Displacement; * D 6112, Standard Test Methods for Compressive and Flexural Creep and Creep-Rupture of Plastic Lumber and Shapes; * D 6117, Standard Test Methods for Mechanical Fasteners in Plastic Lumber and Shapes; * D 6341, Standard Test Method for Determination of the Linear Coefficient of Thermal Expansion of Plastic Lumber and Plastic Lumber Shapes Between ‚Äì30 and 140 ¬∞F (-34.4 and 60 ¬∞C); * D 6435, Standard Test Method for Shear Properties of Plastic Lumber and Plastic Lumber Shapes.

He was an officer of the Royal Engineers employed on the Ordnance Survey. Biographical details Sources The basic sources of material on Clarke are the two articles by Charles Close, one of the Directors of the Ordnance Survey. The first was an article for the Royal Engineers Journal and the second, a revised and expanded version, appeared in the Empire Survey ReviewThe Empire Survey Review changed its name to Survey Review in 1963.. Although Close was almost thirty years younger than Clarke, and joined the Ordnance Survey only after Clarke's retirement, they knew each other well and they collaborated on the article Map for the eleventh edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Much of Close's material is incorporated in the web page REubiqueThe motto of the Royal Engineers is Ubique or everywhere.

Family background and education 1828‚Äì1850 Clarke was born in Reading, Berkshire, England on 16 December 1828. His Scottish father, David Ross Clarke, had travelled to Jamaica as a young merchant and there he married Elizabeth (Eliza) Ann Hall, the daughter of Colonel Charles William Hall and Isabella Ann Ford, on 8 March 1827 in Kingston.Information on Clarke's parents is taken from a Turnbull family website. The relevant pages are found under the entries for Clarke and a document relating to the Hall family. They came to England for the birth of Alexander but they must have returned to Jamaica very soon afterwards for Alexander would later regale his own children with stories of his childhood experiences in the colony. The parents, David and Eliza, were back in England by 1834The Clarke Family Bible shows that David Clarke's eldest daughter was born at Canterbury in 1834 but they soon moved up to David's family home at EribollDavid Clarke was born on 28 February 1800 at Keddale in the parish of Durness. Record At some later date the family moved to Eriboll in the same parish. in the far north of Scotland. The school teaching there was primitive but effective. repeats an anecdote told by Alexander's younger brother: \\"I do not know what schooling he had in those young days, but I remember his telling me of a dominieDominie is an old Scottish term for teacher. putting him under his desk and kicking him from time to time, also how tawsThe tawse was the standard implement of school punishment in Scotland. were used. Anyway he learned Latin and mathematics.\\" Close adds that \\"The mathematics that was thus kicked into him determined his career in after life.\\" Clarke at 22 David Clarke and his family moved to London, before 1846, and eventually settled at 35 Devonshire Place, where he died in 1861. His wife, Eliza Ann, died in 1887. It was from this London address that Alexander Clarke, at the age of seventeen in 1846, applied to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich as a Gentleman Cadet.For an account of Gentleman Cadets see The History of RMA Sandhurst. Clarke was very unprepared for the entrance examination, having left a space of only three weeks for revision, and he was placed bottom of the list of candidates. At Woolwich he would undergo basic military training and formal teaching in subjects such as mathematics and engineering. Clarke excelled at his studies and he passed out first, with \\"the reputation of being an exceptionally capable young man\\" . He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 1 October 1847.For more on the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich see the RE website which includes a page for the class of 1847 After his commissioning, Clarke attended the Young Officers Course at the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham and there he would have studied surveying as well as military engineering. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 11 July 1849 at the end of that course. Ordnance Survey 1850‚Äì1881 In 1849, during the last months of his time at Chatham, Clarke decided to try for the Ordnance Survey and he made an indirect approach to the Superintendent, Colonel Hall, through the good offices of Colonel Reid, his former professor at the Royal Military Academy . Hall had no funds to employ Clarke that year but he recruited him the following year when the government approved funding for the preparation of the final report on the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. This was an opportune moment, for the Survey had recently lost some of its senior staff and, at the same time, Hall had banished Captain William Yolland, the most able member of the Survey, to its remotest office in Enniskillen.For an account of the disastrous relationship between Hall and Yolland see pp. 44‚Äî46 (52‚Äî54 in pdf) Before Clarke could make progress on the calculation of the triangulation, the War Office intervened and abruptly dispatched him to military service in Canada. The nature of the posting is not recorded but it had one happy outcome. Clarke met, and married,The wedding took place in Montreal on 1 November 1853: see or PDF transcription Frances Maria, youngest daughter of Colonel Matthew C. Dixon, his commanding officer. Superintendent Hall retired in 1854 and Yolland, the most competent member of the Survey, was passed over in favour of Colonel Henry James. Yolland resigned immediately and Clarke was the only qualified candidate for the analysis of the triangulation. (James was not a mathematician.) The magnitude of this task is discussed below. The report was accomplished by 1858, an exceedingly short period of time. His endeavour was rewarded by his military promotion to 2nd Captain in 1855 and by being appointed head of the Trigonometrical and Levelling Departments of the Ordnance Survey in 1856. Clarke worked intensely on a number of major projects (below) during the 27 years to 1881, all of which were described in voluminous reports. Clarke appears to have got on well enough with Superintendent James despite James's habit of having his name well to the forefront on these reports.For a review of Hall's tenure at the Survey see p53 (p62 in pdf). The total experience of these years was distilled in Clarke's famous textbook, Geodesy.See . claims that Clarke invented the term Geodesy. This is untrue for the OED claims that the word is first found with its modern meaning in the writing of John Dee,1570. upright Clarke's contribution to the Survey greatly enhanced its reputation. He himself was acknowledged as one of greatest geodesists in the world and he was honoured with fellowships at the Royal Society of London (1862) and the Philosophical Society of Cambridge (1871). He was also elected a Corresponding Member of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences (1868).Clarke had cooperated closely with Struve on geodetic matters. He was made a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1870.Order of the Bath reported in His army promotions were to Captain (1861), Major of Army Rank (1871), Major of Regimental Rank (1872), Lieutenant Colonel (1872) and Colonel (1877). (See de Santis 2002). The Clarke family lived in Southampton from 1854 to 1881, the last twenty years in a fashionable Georgian property at 21, Carlton Crescent.See the article by and also note the listing at English Heritage . The family was large, nine daughters, and four boys, one of whom died young. During the time of intense activity with the Survey, Clarke preferred to work at home with this large family around him. . Two of the girls and the three boys married. One son, Eric Manley Clarke, later was the first teacher in mathematics at the Lincoln Agricultural College (now Lincoln University) in Lincoln, New Zealand. Retirement and legacy 1881‚Äì1914 upright Superintendent James retired in 1875 and he was succeeded by his deputy, Colonel John Cameron. He died suddenly in 1878 and after his death Clarke was made acting head of the Survey until the appointment of Colonel Anthony C. Cooke.See the list of Directors-General It was surprising that Clarke himself was not appointed. Three years later the War Office intervened in his career once again; \\"an official of a well-known type woke up to the fact that he had been at a home station (i.e. the Survey at Southampton) for twenty-seven years, and he was ordered to go to Mauritius\\" . Clarke, a man of some-what hasty temper (Close), strongly resented this summary order which involved such a complete break with his life's work and he promptly sent in his resignation from the Army.Clarke's friend and fellow RE, Colonel George Gordon, later General Gordon, tried to persuade Clarke to withdraw his resignation but he refused and Gordon himself took the posting to Mauritius. Despite protestations to the War Office from the scientific establishment, Clarke's resignation was allowed to stand. \\"Clarke's retirement was a veritable disaster for the Survey, and his departure lowered the whole tone and scientific status of the department for many a long year.\\" . From 1881 Clarke's involvement with geodesy becomes more and more tenuous. In October 1883 he and Airy were the British delegates at the International Geodetic Conference in Rome, and in 1884 he represented Britain at the International Meridian Conference. Thereafter he published no further work on the subject apart from his revision, with Helmert, of his Encyclop√¶dia Britannica articles.See (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911a). His fame was not diminished in any way: he was made an honorary Fellow of both the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1892) and the Royal Astronomical Society. His most prestigious award was the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1887.Royal medal citation: . The text of the citation is as follows: > \\"The medal which, in accordance with the usual rule has been devoted to > mathematics and physics, has this year been awarded to Colonel A.

His wife died in 1888. With only his army pension to support the family he was in straitened circumstances and he was forced to cancel his subscriptions to London clubs and the learned societies. These included his membership of the Royal Society but, in 1888, he was honoured by re-admission without fees. His son recounts that he even sold his Royal Medal, for forty pounds, but gave half away to charity.Comment of one of Clarke's sons in . Although Clarke disengaged from the study of geodesy he was clearly mentally active until a very good age. The accounts by Close mention microscopy, the four colour problem, music and, above all, religion. Alexander Ross Clarke died on 11 February 1914 in Reigate. There is a brief obituary in the but the Royal Society obituary and the Nature obituary are more comprehensive. For many years he was the most prominent geodesist in Britain.See the reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at the 1925 Southampton meeting in and . Major geodetic contributions Principal Triangulation, 1858 The principal triangulation mesh over Britain, 1860. The Principal Triangulation of Great BritainThe original report is but the triangulation is also discussed in the books of , , and . was initiated by the Board of Ordnance in 1791 and carried out under the direction of William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby. The field work was completed in 1853, just as Clarke joined the Board. The methods of analysis had been planned in outline by William Yolland, his predecessor at the head of the Trigonometric Section, but it fell to Clarke to finalize the methods and carry them through to completion. This he achieved in the four years from 1854 to 1858: the report was published as but it is entirely Clarke's work. The basic data was the collection of angle bearings taken from each of the 289 stations towards a number of other stations, typically from three to ten in number. The multiple observations were first subjected to a least squares error analysis to extract the most likely angles and then the triangles formed by the corrected bearings were adjusted simultaneously, again by least squares methods, to find the most likely geometry for the whole mesh. This was an immense undertaking which involved the solution of 920 equations without the aid of matrix methods or digital computers.The calculations were simplified by splitting the mesh into 21 small sub-meshes. The only available computers were the living personnel of the Trigonometric Section, twenty one of them. Once the triangles had been fixed it was then possible to calculate all the sides of the mesh in terms of the length of either of the bases, one by Lough Foyle in Ireland and the other on Salisbury plain. The accuracy of the survey was such that when the length of the Lough Foyle base was calculated through the triangulation mesh from the Salisbury base the error was only 5 inches when compared with its measured length (of 41,640.887 feet or about 8 miles). The final step was to use the distances and angles to work out the latitude and longitude of each triangulation point on the Airy ellipsoid. The natural course of events after a primary triangulation is to construct a secondary triangulation with sides of a few miles, and then a tertiary triangulation at a parish level to show all significant details. Unfortunately this did not happen because the infilling had been going on for fifty years of topographic surveying, with maps already published on a county basis. Some of those maps had origins that were connected to the primary triangulation, and some did not. As a result, the county maps were only loosely tied to the principal triangulation and no attempt was made to revise them. Figure of the Earth, 1858 A perspective projection showing the meridian arcs used in computing the figure of the Earth, 1860. The latitudes and longitudes of the triangulation were calculated on the Airy ellipsoid for which the semimajor axis (a) and inverse flattening (c=1/f with f=1-b/a) are * a=20923713 ft., c=280.4. (Airy 1830) In the penultimate section of the Principal Triangulation Clarke compared the calculated latitudes with the actual observed values and he adjusted the ellipsoid parameters so that the differences were minimized in a least squares fit. The result was * a=20927005 ft., c=299.33. (Best fitting ellipsoid for GB, 1858) These values were of academic value only since Britain continued to define latitude and longitude on the Airy ellipsoid or, after 1936, a slightly modified version. In the final section of the report Clarke combined the British data with that for the meridian arcs of France, Russia, India, Prussia, Peru, Hanover and Denmark. The result was * a=20926348 ft., c=294.26. (Clarke 1858.) Triaxial Figure of the Earth, 1860 In he notes that General T. F. de Schubert had published a paper in which he claimed that the meridian arc data established that the equator of the Earth was elliptical in form. Clarke was prompted to analyze a larger data set from which he deduced that if the Earth was indeed a tri-axial ellipsoid with a polar semi-axis (c) and semi-axes a (maximum) and b (minimum) in the equatorial plane, then * c=20853768 ft., a=20926485 ft., at 13¬∞58‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥E b=20921177 ft., at 103¬∞58‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥E so that the inverse flattening varied between 309.4 and 286.8. (The difference in the equatorial semi-axes is approximately one mile.) However, Clarke estimated the errors of the results and found that the error in longitudes could be as much as 20¬∞. Therefore, he maintained that the data were not accurate enough to justify a tri-axial model. Levelling of Great Britain, 1861 Principal lines of spirit levelling in England, 1860 In addition to the determination of the precise location of the trigonometric points the Survey established the precise altitude of a number of fundamental benchmarks by spirit levelling over the years 1839 to 1860. This height survey was completely independent of the position survey, in contrast to modern GPS fixes which give both. The report of the levelling in Ireland had been published in 1855, and it fell to Clarke to prepare the reports for England and Scotland. For England this involved a least squares analysis for the 62 lines of primary levelling with 91 fundamental benchmarks at the end points and at points of intersection. The reference level was the height of Mean Water at Liverpool. 32 end points were connected to tidal stations and therefore the variation of mean water around the country was fixed. The benchmarking proceeded along the roads, but side lines were taken to, and over, many of the mountain top trig points, from which other trig point altitudes were measured by trigonometric levelling. The reports were published in 1861. Unlike the Principal Triangulation report no theory was included in Clarke's levelling reports.See and for discussions of levelling. International connections: the longitudinal arc at 52¬∞N, 1863 In there is a discussion of the European cooperation proposed by Otto Struve, namely that the Triangulations of Russia, Prussia, Belgium, France and Britain be connected so that arc along the parallel at 52¬∞N could be measured. This large arc, of 75¬∞ of longitude, would provide a very valuable constraint on attempts to calculate the figure of the Earth. The Ordnance Survey had completed a cross-channel survey over 50 years previously and, as part of the Principal Triangulation in 1858, had measured the distance from Valentia Island (51¬∞28‚Ä≤N, 10¬∞20‚Ä≤W) to Greenwich (51¬∞55‚Ä≤N). The accuracy of the cross- channel survey was poor by the standards of 1860, and there were also doubts about the Triangulation in Valentia, so it was decided to repeat both sets of measurements. The extension to France and Belgium is reported in , providing data for the section of the 52¬∞N arc between Valentia and Mount Kemmel in Belgium. The calculations were carried out by Clarke, who used the data to give a further improvement for the Figure of the Earth. That same data also provided a much tighter foundation for the Anglo-French meridional arc. The data for the re-analysis of the triangulation near Valentia is reported in . The full 52¬∞N arc as proposed took another thirty years to complete. It is discussed in the article on the Figure of the Earth in . Length comparisons and Figure of the Earth, 1866 As soon as the proposal to unite a number of European triangulations had been made it was apparent that the effort would be of little benefit unless conversions between the different length units were established as accurately as possible. This had already been done for some pairs of standards, but a new, high precision comparison of all the standards was now required. The results would also have implications for combining arc measurements to determine the Figure of the Earth, so for this reason non- European standards were also included. The comparisons were carried out under Clarke's supervision in a special building constructed at Survey headquarters in Southampton. He presented the results in two reports: compared versions of the standard foot/yard (used in surveys of Britain, India and Australia), versions of the toise (from Russia, Belgium and France), the French metre, and the British copy of the metre. In each case one of the yard standards was taken as the basic unit. Next, extended the comparisons to a second Russian toise, the Austrian klafter (and two of its copies), and Spanish and American copies of the metre. Clarke found that nominally identical standards differed by small amounts measurable in millionths of a yard (or thousandths of a millimetre).Length Comparisons , page 280.Length Comparisons , page 495. includes an appendix in which Clarke considers the Figure of the Earth once again. He finds: * a=20926062 ft., c=294.98, (Clarke 1866) * a=6378206.4 m., c=294.98, (Clarke 1866) The conversion is 1 metre = 3.280869367 feet (as given in the 1866 paper). This ellipsoid became important because the USCGS adopted it for surveys in 1880. It remains relevant because many US topographic maps are still based on Clarke's 1866 ellipsoid. Moreover, many US legal documents include boundary definitions in terms of latitude and longitude values defined on that ellipsoid. Textbook Geodesy, 1880 Geodesy was the first major survey of the subject since the work of Airy. It was well received throughout Europe and it was translated into a number of languages. It contained 14 chapters.

The papers listed in the Bibliography are almost all related to some aspect of geodesy, the only exceptions being a student publication entitled Propositions on the Tetrahedron and a short paper on Just Intonation which reflects his interest in music. Clarke also contributed two important articles to the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1878), one on Geodesy and a second on the Figure of the Earth (with the title of the latter being Earth, Figure of the). These articles appear unchanged in the tenth edition (1903).

The son of artist and mapmaker Ambroise Tardieu, he achieved his Doctorate in Medicine at the Facult√© de M√©decine of Paris. He was President of the French Academy of Medicine, as well as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Professor of Legal Medicine at the University of Paris. Tardieu's specialties were forensic medicine and toxicology. Over his 23-year career, Tardieu participated as a forensic expert in 5,238 cases, including many famous and notorious historical crimes. Using his cases as a statistical base, Tardieu wrote over a dozen volumes of forensic analysis, covering such diverse areas as abortion, drowning, hanging, insanity, homosexuality, poisoning, suffocation, syphilis, and tattoos. In recognition of his first clinical descriptions of battered children, battered child syndrome is also known as Tardieu's syndrome. Tardieu's ecchymoses, subpleural spots of ecchymosis that follow the death of a newborn child by strangulation or suffocation, were first described by Tardieu in 1859, and were so named in his honor. Scientific work on sexuality and child abuse His most famous scientific works were a book on forensic toxicology that became a reference work in this field in the 19th century, and a book on the forensic examinations related to ‚Äùassault on decency‚Äù, a legal term covering indecent exposure, rape and homosexuality.√âtude m√©dico-l√©gale et clinique sur l‚Äôempoisonnement, 1867 and Etude M√©dico-L√©gale sur les Attentats aux M≈ìurs, 1857 He also wrote a pioneering study on maltreatment against children and he published on the terrible working conditions of young boys and girls in mines and factories. A study of copper workers (both child and adult) led to a radical improvement in their working conditions. Though Tardieu‚Äôs textbook on the legal medicine of poisoning was the work that did most to establish him as an authority in his time, for the posterity he is most famous for his forensic study of sexual crimes: Etude M√©dico-L√©gale sur les Attentats aux M≈ìurs The title of the book may be freely translated as \\"Forensic Study of Sexual Assault\\". The study consists of three parts: the first deals with indecent exposures, the second with rape and the third with \\"pederasty\\" (sexual relations between an older and a younger man). This third part is considered a classic study in the history of homosexuality. Written before the term homosexuality was coined, Tardieu sought to identify external signs of committed ‚Äùpederasty‚Äù which may help the forensic expert present convincing evidence that a crime had been committed to the court of law. In so doing, Tardieu discussed the causes of homosexuality, without making them the main purpose of his study. He presumed some of the ‚Äùpederasts‚Äù had an inborn inclination, but nevertheless considered the sexual practice in question to be a condemnable vice. According to Tardieu, same-sex sexuality was often linked to crime, such as blackmailing and assassinations. The book was an important precursor to Krafft-Ebing‚Äôs Psychopathia sexualis, the most famous pre-Freudian study on same-sex sexual practices. For the modern reader this work is an important historical document, particularly valuable for the cultural history of sexuality by the glimpses it gives into some of the secret sexual cultures of his time. In the section on rape, Tardieu also deals with child abuse. According to his numbers over 75% of all the rapes or attempted rapes tried in French courts were committed against children under 16 years old, and most of those against girls under 12 years old. Additionally, he noted that incestuous rape was not uncommon (also see Sigmund Freud's Seduction Theory). This topic was also dealt with in a separate paper (Etude m√©dico-l√©gale sur les s√©vices et mauvais traitements exerc√©s sur des enfants i.e. \\"A Medico-legal Study of Cruelty and Brutal treatment Inflicted on Children\\"), published in Annales d'hygi√®ne publique et de m√©decine l√©gale in 1860). This latter work has been retrospectively recognized to be the first scientific or medical book about child sexual abuse.Masson, 1984, pp. 15‚Äì19 and 34‚Äì38 The findings in this study were later republished in the book √âtude sur les Blessures, which was published in 1879, the year of Tardieu's death. In this, his last book, Tardieu claimed to have been the first physician to publish on this subject.Masson, p. 22 Nonetheless, Tardieu's research on the subject was largely either sharply criticized or ignored by legal authorities and other clinicians.

He is the son of the late theologian and author Francis Schaeffer. He became a Hollywood film director and author, writing several internationally acclaimed novels depicting life in a strict evangelical household including Portofino, Zermatt, and Saving Grandma. While Schaeffer was a conservative, fundamentalist Christian in his youth, he has changed his views, becoming a liberal Democrat and a self-described Christian atheist. He lives north of Boston. Life and career Schaeffer converted from Presbyterian Calvinism to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 1990 and gave lectures on his reasons for rejecting conservative Evangelical Protestantism. He has criticized the traditional positions of the Orthodox Churches on matters of sexual morality. In 2006 Schaeffer published Baby Jack, a novel about a US Marine killed in Iraq. He is also known for his non-fiction books related to the Marine Corps, including Keeping Faith: A Father-Son Story About Love and the United States Marine Corps, co-written with his son John Schaeffer, and AWOL: The Unexcused Absence of America's Upper Classes from Military Service and How It Hurts Our Country, co-authored with former Bill Clinton presidential aide Kathy Roth-Douquet. In 2007 Schaeffer published his autobiography, Crazy for God: How I Grew Up As One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back, in which he goes into much more detail regarding what it was like to grow up in the Schaeffer family and around L'Abri. In 2011, he published another memoir, called Sex, Mom, and God, in which he discusses growing up with his parents and their role in the rise of the American religious right and argues that the root of the \\"insanity and corruption\\" of this force in US politics, and specifically of the religious right's position on abortion, is a fear of female sexuality. The two memoirs form the first and third book of what Schaeffer calls his \\"God trilogy\\". The second one, Patience with God: Faith for People Who Don't Like Religion (or Atheism) (2010), describes his spirituality as it exists since abandoning conservative evangelicalism. The first half contains critiques of both the New Atheists and of Christian fundamentalism. Starting with his 2014 book Why I Am an Atheist Who Believes in God, he has described himself as an atheist, saying that even though he attends church every weekend and prays, \\"I do not always believe, let alone know, if God exists. I do not always know he, she, or it does not exist either, though there are long patches in my life when it seems God never did exist.\\" Schaeffer has stated that one of his goals of his book is to \\"unhook [young Evangelicals] from allegiance to the Bible.\\" Political views Schaeffer has gone from being a conservative Republican to becoming a liberal Democrat. When Schaeffer was young, he and his father attended meetings with Jack Kemp, as well as presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Schaeffer has stated that he helped produce Reagan's book \\"Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation.\\" Schaeffer has written: \\"In the mid 1980s I left the Religious Right, after I realized just how very anti-American they are (the theme I explore in my book Crazy For God).\\" He added that he was a Republican until 2000, working for Senator John McCain in that year's primaries, but that after the 2000 election he re-registered as an independent. On February 7, 2008, Schaeffer endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, in an article entitled \\"Why I'm Pro-Life and Pro-Obama.\\" The next month, prompted by the controversy over remarks by the pastor of Obama's church, he wrote: \\"[W]hen my late father ‚Äì Religious Right leader Francis Schaeffer ‚Äì denounced America and even called for the violent overthrow of the US government, he was invited to lunch with presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush, Sr.\\" After the 2008 Russian-Georgian War, Schaeffer described Russia as a resurgent Orthodox Christian power, paying back the West for its support of Muslim Kosovar secessionists against Orthodox Serbia. On October 10, 2008, a public letter to Senator John McCain and Sarah Palin from Schaeffer was published in the Baltimore Sun newspaper. The letter contained an impassioned plea for McCain to arrest what Schaeffer perceived as a hateful and prejudiced tone of the Republican Party's election campaign. Schaeffer was convinced that there was a pronounced danger that fringe groups in America could be goaded into pursuing violence. \\"If you do not stand up for all that is good in America and declare that Senator Obama is a patriot, fit for office, and denounce your hate-filled supporters... history will hold you responsible for all that follows.\\" Soon after Obama's inauguration, Schaeffer criticized Republican leaders: In an interview on October 23, 2009, Schaeffer said his and his father's (Francis) position on abortion was co-opted by people looking for an issue that could shift political power within America. In 2012, Schaeffer criticized the Republican Party's pro-life position on abortion, something which received criticism from Rod Dreher and other conservative Christians.

The film juxtapositions opposing views about the tradition and practice of child marriages. Is child marriage a blessing or a children human rights issue? You decide. This is the central theme of this documentary. Child marriage is a tradition practiced in select parts of the world. UNICEF has declared this to be a human rights issue. Neeraj, the filmmaker, decided to embark on an exploratory journey of discovery. He focused on India, his home country, specifically the states of Rajasthan and Haryana. This film reveals, for the first time, a never before heart fact, and that is, children getting engaged before they were born. No newspaper, TV program, film, or any other media has ever revealed this fact before. The footage of the child marriage film is unique and is being shown worldwide for the first time. In India, parents arrange the marriages of their children. Oftentimes, the pundit (Priest) matches the horoscopes of the couple in order to decide the suitability of the match. Every year, in the summer, there is one day when the couple can be married without consulting the horoscopes. This day is called \\"Akshay Teej\\". \\"Abodh saave\\" are a few days around these days that are considered equally auspicious. Most arranged child marriages seem to happen around this time. Arranged child marriages seem to occur more in certain castes as compared to others. During his travels, Neeraj met with a number of children whose marriages had been arranged by their parents. He witnessed the marriages in backward castes, specifically, schedule tribes, schedule castes, and other backward castes. In a remote village, he met a pair of brothers belonging to the untouchable caste. There is a lot of discrimination against the people of this caste. Untouchables have the lowest status in Indian society and literally, the people of higher castes do not like to physically touch them or anything that they have touched. This is a social injustice is a human rights issue. Neeraj also met with some snake charmers in India. Snake charmers are banned in India and yet they can be found lurking in hidden pockets of society. This is an animal rights issue. During his travels, Neeraj passed by long forgotten historical places that have romantic stories associated with them. He also visited a Sati temple. Such temples are banned in India because this is a woman rights issue. A Sati is a woman (widow) who is cremated alive with her husband's dead body. The film also shows unique folk dances and music from Rajasthan. Neeraj interviewed an UNICEF official, the parents of children being married, village government official, adults who were married when they were children, and parents who will marry their children in the coming years. The film was shot in New York (USA), Denver (USA) and India(New Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana).

History The abbey was founded in 987 by √Üthelm√¶r the Stout. √Ülfric of Eynsham, the most prolific writer in Old English, was known to have spent time at the abbey as a priest and teacher.Hutchinson Encyclopedia (1988), p. 14 King Canute is known to have plundered this monastery during an attack upon the town, but afterwards became a benefactor of it. By the time of the Domesday Book, the abbey had added substantially to its endowment. Much of this wealth has been creditedTom Licence, Goscelin of St Bertin and the Life of St. Eadwold of Cerne, Journal The Journal of Medieval Latin vol 16 to the veneration of Saint Eadwold of Cerne, a 9th-century hermit reputedly a brother of Edmund, king of East Anglia. Eadwold lived as a hermit on a hill about four miles from Cerne. The later history appears to have been relatively uneventful; A History of the County of Dorset says that its history is \\"perhaps the least eventful of any of the Dorset houses with the exception of that of the sisters at Tarrant Kaines\\". The abbey's history ended on a less positive note, with the last abbot, Thomas Corton, accused of various offences including that of allowing the abbey and lands to become ruinous, and of keeping a mistress who seems to have borne him children. The accusations were taken seriously enough to warrant inspection by commissioners, and the abbey was closed in 1539. Following the dissolution, the buildings were mainly demolished. Abbey House, a Grade I listed building, occupies the site of the gatehouse and incorporates parts of it. Most of the house dates from after a fire in the middle of the 18th century in which the gatehouse was seriously damaged. The late 15th century Guest House of the abbey is also Grade I listed, as is the very elaborate stone vaulted porch of the abbot's hall, built around 1500, which survives in the midst of a wooded lawn, with a Grade II* listed, early 16th century barn lying to its north. A Grade I listed, 14th-century tithe barn, converted to a house in the late 18th century, lies to its east.

It won First Prize at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1977, and was routinely screened before Devo live concerts. It is included as an extra on the Criterion release of Island of Lost Souls (1932). Stills from the film were used for the front and back cover of European releases and the inner sleeve of American releases of Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! in 1978. Synopsis The film begins with an extreme close-up of a television, switching between channels while odd gibberish noises play in the background. The film title is superimposed over the television screen. The scene fades to a shot of a factory (filmed at the Goodyear World of Rubber in Akron, Ohio). Members of Devo in its quartet stage are seen in blue workmen's suits, operating machinery, until one notices it is time to go. All the band members wear clear face masks, except for Mark Mothersbaugh, who appears in his Booji Boy mask. The members leave work and get into a car. They pull up in front of the burned out Kent bar The Water Street Saloon which was two buildings down from JB's in Kent, Ohio. The next clip shows them entering the front door of JB's, carrying instruments. A sign on the door reads \\"Tonight: 15-60-75\\", a reference to The Numbers Band, which Gerald Casale played bass for at one point. The \\"Secret Agent Man\\" performance begins, featuring Bob Mothersbaugh on guitar, Gerald Casale on bass, Jim Mothersbaugh on electric bongos, and Mark Mothersbaugh/Booji Boy on synthesizers. The performance routinely cuts away to bizarre visuals, such as two men in monkey masks spanking a woman with ping-pong paddles, or a punk playing a double-neck guitar plugged into a space heater. The segment ends with a fadeout of Mark Mothersbaugh in a John F. Kennedy mask. The \\"Jocko Homo\\" segment begins with Booji Boy running through a parking lot off of Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls. He enters a building through the fire escape to meet with General Boy. They exchange papers, and General Boy makes a statement: \\"In the past this information has been suppressed, but now it can be told. Every man, woman, and mutant on this planet shall know the truth about de-evolution.\\" Booji replies with a famous line: \\"Oh, dad, we're all devo!\\" A series of rapid-fire cuts of the letters in \\"DEVO\\" appears (with the music of \\"Mechanical Man\\" found on Hardcore Devo: Volume One), and then we cut to Mark Mothersbaugh in a Kent State University classroom (actually the Governance Chambers), delivering a lecture. As Mothersbaugh delivers the lyrics to \\"Jocko Homo\\", the classroom enters a frenzy of excitement, ending in a near riot. The film ends with a scene of Booji Boy being stabbed and his mask removed. Then the credits play in a style similarly to the title with an extremely distorted cover of \\"Because\\" by the Beatles playing. The film ends with a shot of the word \\"DEVO\\" in neon flashing off. Miscellaneous * Devo has claimed, occasionally, that the film contains subliminal messages, which allowed it to win at Ann Arbor. * The ping-pong paddles shown in the Secret Agent Man segment have images of Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong on them. * The \\"Shine On America\\" mural shown in the pre-Jocko Homo segment also appears on the cover of The Akron Compilation, an album of songs by Akron area bands. * The synthesizer music featured in the pre-\\"Jocko Homo\\" segment was sampled by the French electronic group Justice for the song \\"Stress\\", from their 2007 album ‚Ä†. * The opening of the \\"Secret Agent Man\\" video features an early version of \\"Smart Patrol\\".

Its member clubs were exclusively based in Texas. It saw much change in its 11-year lifetime, with no team serving as a member in every single season. Waco came the closest, serving from 1947‚Äì1956. The league was known as an offense-oriented circuit. The league debuted at the height of the short-lived postwar minor league baseball boom, in 1947, with eight clubs, all unaffiliated with Major League Baseball farm systems. Original teams were the: Austin Pioneers, Gainesville Owls, Greenville Majors, Paris Red Peppers, Sherman‚ÄìDenison Twins, Texarkana Bears, Waco Dons and Wichita Falls Spudders.Big_State_League Two clubs, Texarkana and Greenville, won more than 100 games in 1947, and four league members exceeded 100,000 in attendance. But beginning in 1953, the Big State League's teams struggled to reach six figures in that category. Only Corpus Christi drew over the 100,000 mark during the league's final five seasons, doing so on two occasions. The league was further weakened when a traditionally strong member, Austin, moved up to the AA Texas League in 1956. The league began the 1957 campaign with only six clubs: the Victoria Rosebuds, Corpus Christi Clippers, Beaumont Pirates, Abilene Blue Sox, Port Arthur Redlegs and Wichita Falls Spudders.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Big_State_League Its ranks were reduced to four when Wichita Falls disbanded in May, while the Port Arthur team moved to Temple that same month before folding in August. Of the surviving teams, Victoria, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team, outlasted Corpus Christi, Beaumont and Abilene to win the league's last pennant and playoff championship. J. Walter Morris served as League President from 1947 through 1950, Howard Green, took over from 1951 through 1955 and Hal Sayles was in charge the final two years, 1956-57.

Each of these techniques is based on correcting common postural faults by addressing the neuromuscular system through postural re-education. Yet, the Mitzvah Technique encompasses both a unique philosophy and a set of procedures. This includes the discipline, exercises, and the work that Mitzvah Technique practitioners do with their hands.R. Omel. \\"The Mitzvah Technique: a proactive approach to optimizing the benefits of chiropractic care.\\" Today's Chiropractic: July 2000 (29:4): 52‚Äì59. Principles The Mitzvah Technique has been designed as an easily learned rehabilitative and self-care discipline. It utilizes body mechanics in the acts of standing, sitting, and walking. The philosophy is that with practice, the discipline becomes integrated into all common activities of daily life. The Mitzvah Technique is based on the philosophy of the Mitzvah Mechanism. The Mechanism consists of a sequence of natural body movements that magnify the rippling motion in the body. There are four components to the Mitzvah Mechanism: (1) The interplay of physical forces acting between the pelvis and spine, (2) the rippling spinal motion, (3) the dynamic relationship involving the pelvis, spine and head in a synchronized motion, and (4) the freedom of the head to balance on its spinal support. All of these together promote the operation of the Mitzvah Mechanism.M. Cohen-Nehemia. The Mitzvah Technique and The Mitzvah Exercise. Halifax: Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Dalhousie University: 1981. The Mitzvah Technique is designed to improve posture and release tension and stress through exercises and therapeutic table work. It claims to realign, rebalance and exercise the entire body during sitting, standing and walking. Its aim is to replace long-term work by practitioners, to have people learn how to use the Mitzvah Technique itself. Musicians, actors and singers have been extensive users.Cohen-Nehemiah, M. \\"The Mitzvah Technique.\\" Presentation to the 18th World Congress of Natural Medicine, Havana, April 1990 The Mitzvah Exercise The Mitzvah Technique contends that activating and practicing the Mitzvah Exercise and mastering its discipline are what corrects faulty posture and, by extension, many of the aches and pains associated with it.M. Cohen-Nehemia and N.F. Clinch. 1982. ‚ÄúA New Procedure for Improving Body Mechanics: An Experimental Test‚Äù. Perceptual and Motor Skills 55:363‚Äì368. The Mitzvah Exercise is a set of movements involving sitting, standing, and walking. The Exercise requires no special equipment other than a chair or stool and space for walking around. The seat should be firm and flat and low enough so that the feet will be flat on the floor when the body is seated. Loose clothing and no shoes are suggested. This is to allow freedom of movement at the hip joint and the transfer of energy through the feet. The Exercise should be performed under the direction of a suitable Mitzvah Technique teacher and does not substitute for necessary professional health care. It is best described in a booklet prepared by the founder of the Technique, M. Cohen-Nehemia: The Mitzvah Exercise and Its Principle.M. Cohen- Nehemia, The Mitzvah Exercise and Its Principle: Improving Human Performance. Toronto: Mitzvah Technique Centre, 1983. The Mitzvah Technique is designed to improve posture and release tension and stress through exercises and therapeutic table work. It is based on the \\"Mitzvah Mechanism\\", an upward rippling motion that gently reinforces the body's balance with gravity. It realigns, rebalances and exercises the entire body during sitting, standing and walking. As a result, this mechanism is readily applied to daily activities. The technique was developed by M. Cohen-Nehemia of Toronto, a Yemeni-Israeli immigrant to Canada. It was originally derived from the Alexander Technique, but has independently developed since the early 1970s. History M. Cohen-Nehemia, the originator of the Mitzvah Technique, was born and raised in Jerusalem in 1924. There he studied classical, modern and oriental dance and was a member of the Inbal Dance Theater of Israel. Similar to F. M. Alexander who lost his voice as an actor and regained it through self-discovery,Barlow, W. 1973. The Alexander Principle. London: Gollancz Nehemia suffered major back problems as a dancer and gained functionality by successfully helping himself through his own experiences and research on body movement. He participated in training seminars for dance and physical education teachers at the kibbutz school which gave him insights into the relationship between body movement and body health. Nehemia also studied anatomy with Dr. Yitzhak Farine of the Tel-Hashomer government hospital. This resulted in Dr. Farine inviting Nehemia to work at the hospital's rehabilitation center. Nehemia was introduced to the Alexander Technique through a course given at the Tel HaShomer Hospital to medical staff. This introduction affected Nehemia's work. Together with his wife Malka, they travelled to London where Nehemia spent five years qualifying as an Alexander Teacher at the London School as well as studying at F.M. Alexander's studio. He concomitantly began developing his own version of the Alexander Technique that he called the Mitzvah Technique to emphasize the rippling motion of the body. When Nehemia returned to Israel, he assisted Moshe Feldenkrais by introducing the Mitzvah Technique into the Feldenkrais Method.Feldenkrais, M. 1972. Awareness Through Movement. New York: Harper & Row. They worked together at the Tel HaShomer Hospital in the physical rehabilitation of wounded Israeli Defence Force soldiers suffering with severe back and spinal injuries. At the same time, Nehemia was taking classes given by Feldenkrais for teachers and actors. As a dancer and Alexander Teacher, Nehemia also spent years observing working bodies in action among animals, children, fellow Inbal dancers and the nomadic Bedouin. Out of these myriad experiences and observations came the fuller development of the Mitzvah Technique, emphasizing the natural rippling motion of the spine.Cohen-Nehemia, M. The Mitzvah Technique and the Mitzvah Exercise Halifax, NS, Canada: Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Dalhousie University, 1981 Nehemia came to Toronto in the late 1960s where he established the Centre for the Alexander Technique that later became the Mitzvah Technique Centre. This centre has trained scores of Mitzvah teachers and treated thousands of clients who have come from around the world. Nehemia died November 18, 2018 at the age of 94 after years debilitated by a stroke. Notes External links *Lecture on the Mitzvah Technique Set for October 23.

Phage ecology is the study of the interaction of bacteriophages with their environments.This article on phage ecology was expanded from a stub during the writing of the first chapter of the edited monograph, Bacteriophage Ecology (forecasted publication date: March, 2008, Cambridge University Press), in order to be cited by that chapter especially as a repository of phage ecology review chapters and articles.  Introduction to phage ecology   Vastness of phage ecology  Phages are obligate intracellular parasites meaning that they are able to reproduce only while infecting bacteria. Phages therefore are found only within environments that contain bacteria. Most environments contain bacteria, including our own bodies (called normal flora). Often these bacteria are found in large numbers. As a consequence, phages are found almost everywhere. As a rule of thumb, many phage biologists expect that phage population densities will exceed bacterial densities by a ratio of 10-to-1 or more (VBR or virus-to-bacterium ratio; see for a summary of actual data). As there exist estimates of bacterial numbers on Earth of approximately 1030, there consequently is an expectation that 1031 or more individual virus (mostly phage) particles exist , making phages the most numerous category of \\"organisms\\" on our planet. Bacteria (along with archaea) appear to be highly diverse and there possibly are millions of species. Phage-ecological interactions therefore are quantitatively vast: huge numbers of interactions. Phage-ecological interactions are also qualitatively diverse: There are huge numbers of environment types, bacterial-host types, and also individual phage types  Studying phage ecology  The study of phage ecology reflects established scientific disciplines in ecological studies in scope, the most obvious being general ecology. Accordingly, phage ecology is treated under the following heads \\"organismal\\" ecology, population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology. Phage ecology also may be considered (though mostly less well formally explored) from perspectives of phage behavioral ecology, evolutionary ecology, functional ecology, landscape ecology, mathematical ecology, molecular ecology, physiological ecology (or ecophysiology), and spatial ecology. Phage ecology additionally draws (extensively) from microbiology, particularly in terms of environmental microbiology, but also from an enormous catalog (90 years) of study of phage and phage-bacterial interactions in terms of their physiology and, especially, their molecular biology.  Phage \\"organismal\\" ecology  Phage \\"organismal\\" ecology is primarily the study of the evolutionary ecological impact of phage growth parameters: *latent period, plus **eclipse period (or simply \\"eclipse\\") **rise period (or simply \\"rise\\") *burst size, plus **rate of intracellular phage-progeny maturation *adsorption constant, plus **rates of virion diffusion **virion decay (inactivation) rates *host range, plus **resistance to restriction **resistance to abortive infection *various temperate-phage properties, including **rates of reduction to lysogeny **rates of lysogen induction *the tendency of at least some phage to enter into (and then subsequently leave) a not very well understood state known (inconsistently) as pseudolysogeny Another way of envisioning phage \\"organismal\\" ecology is that it is the study of phage adaptations that contribute to phage survival and transmission to new hosts or environments. Phage \\"organismal\\" ecology is the most closely aligned of phage ecology disciplines with the classical molecular and molecular genetic analyses of bacteriophage. From the perspective of ecological subdisciplines, we can also consider phage behavioral ecology, functional ecology, and physiological ecology under the heading of phage \\"organismal\\" ecology. However, as noted, these subdisciplines are not as well developed as more general considerations of phage \\"organismal\\" ecology. Phage growth parameters often evolve over the course of phage experimental adaptation studies.  Historical overview  In the mid 1910s, when phage were first discovered, the concept of phage was very much a whole-culture phenomenon (like much of microbiology), where various types of bacterial cultures (on solid media, in broth) were visibly cleared by phage action. Though from the start there was some sense, especially by Fƒólix d'Hƒórelle, that phage consisted of individual \\"organisms\\", in fact it wasn't until the late 1930s through the 1940s that phages were studied, with rigor, as individuals, e.g., by electron microscopy and single-step growth experiments. Note, though, that for practical reasons much of \\"organismal\\" phage study is of their properties in bulk culture (many phage) rather than the properties of individual phage virions or individual infections. This somewhat whole- organismal view of phage biology saw its heyday during the 1940s and 1950s, before giving way to much more biochemical, molecular genetic, and molecular biological analyses of phages, as seen during the 1960s and onward. This shift, paralleled in much of the rest of microbiology , represented a retreat from a much more ecological view of phages (first as bacterial killers, and then as organisms unto themselves). However, the organismal view of phage biology lives on as a foundation of phage ecological understanding. Indeed, it represents a key thread that ties together the ecological thinking on phage ecology with the more \\"modern\\" considerations of phage as molecular model systems.  Methods  The basic experimental toolkit of phage \\"organismal\\" ecology consists of the single-step growth (or one-step growth;) experiment and the phage adsorption curve. Single-step growth is a means of determining the phage latent period (example), which is approximately equivalent (depending on how it is defined) to the phage period of infection. Single-step growth experiments also are employed to determine a phage's burst size, which is the number of phage (on average) that are produced per phage-infected bacterium. The adsorption curve is obtained by measuring the rate at which phage virion particles (see Virion#Structure) attach to bacteria. This is usually done by separating free phage from phage-infected bacteria in some manner so that either the loss of not currently infecting (free) phage or the gain of infected bacteria may be measured over time.  Phage population ecology  A population is a group of individuals which either do or can interbreed or, if incapable of interbreeding, then are recently derived from a single individual (a clonal population). Population ecology considers characteristics that are apparent in populations of individuals but either are not apparent or are much less apparent among individuals. These characteristics include so-called intraspecific interactions, that is between individuals making up the same population, and can include competition as well as cooperation. Competition can be either in terms of rates of population growth (as seen especially at lower population densities in resource-rich environments) or in terms of retention of population sizes (seen especially at higher population densities where individuals are directly competing over limited resources). Respectively, these are population-density independent and dependent effects. Phage population ecology considers issues of rates of phage population growth, but also phage-phage interactions as can occur when two or more phage adsorb an individual bacterium.  Phage community ecology  A community consists of all of the biological individuals found within a given environment (more formally, within an ecosystem), particularly when more than one species is present. Community ecology studies those characteristics of communities that either are not apparent or which are much less apparent if a community consists of only a single population. Community ecology thus deals with interspecific interactions. Interspecific interactions, like intraspecific interactions, can range from cooperative to competitive but also to quite antagonistic (as are seen, for example, with predator-prey interactions). An important consequence of these interactions is coevolution.  Relationship with bacteria  The interaction of phage with bacteria is the primary concern of phage community ecologists. Bacteria have developed mechanisms that prevent phages from having an effect on them, which has led to this evolutionary arms race between the phages and their host bacteria. Bacterial resistance to phages puts pressure on the phages to develop stronger effects on the bacteria. The Red Queen hypothesis describes this relationship, as the organisms must constantly adapt and evolve in order to survive. This relationship is important to understand as phages are now being used for more practical and medicinal purposes. Bacteria have developed multiple defense mechanisms to fight off the effects of bacteriophages. issue v33i0001 article 43 In experimentation, amount of resistance can be determined by how much of a plate (generally agar with bacteria, infected with phages) ends up being clear. The clearer, the less resistant as more bacteria have been lysed. The most common of these defense mechanisms is called the restriction-modification system (RM system). In this system, foreign DNA trying to enter the bacterial host is restricted by endonucleases that recognize specific base pairs within the DNA, while the DNA of the cell is protected from restriction due to methylase. RM systems have evolved to keep up with the ever-changing bacteria and phage. In general, these RM types differ in the nucleotide sequences that they recognize. issue v62i0004 article 759 However, there is an occasional slip where the endonuclease misses the DNA sequence of the phage and the phage DNA is able to enter the cell anyway, becoming methylated and protected against the endonuclease. This accident is what can spur the evolution of the RM system. Phages can acquire or use the enzyme from the host cell to protect their own DNA, or sometimes they will have proteins that dismantle the enzyme that is meant to restrict the phage DNA. Another option is for the phage to insert different base pairs into its DNA, thereby confusing the enzyme. Another mechanism employed by bacteria is referred to as CRISPR. This stands for ‚Äúclustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats‚Äù which means that the immunity to phages by bacteria has been acquired via adding spacers of DNA that are identical to that of the DNA from the phage. Some phages have been found to be immune to this mechanism as well. In some way or another, the phages have managed to get rid of the sequence that would be replicated. A third way that bacteria have managed to escape the effects of bacteriophages is by abortive infection. This is a last resort option- when the host cell has already been infected by the phage. This method is not ideal for the host cell, as it still leads to its death. The redeeming feature of this mechanism is the fact that it interferes with the phage processes and prevents it from then moving on to infect other cells. Phages are also capable of interacting with species other than bacteria, e.g., such as phage-encoded exotoxin interaction with animals. Phage therapy is an example of applied phage community ecology.  Phage ecosystem ecology  An ecosystem consists of both the biotic and abiotic components of an environment. Abiotic entities are not alive and so an ecosystem essentially is a community combined with the non- living environment within which that ecosystem exists. Ecosystem ecology naturally differs from community ecology in terms of the impact of the community on these abiotic entities, and vice versa. In practice, the portion of the abiotic environment of most concern to ecosystem ecologists is inorganic nutrients and energy. Phages impact the movement of nutrients and energy within ecosystems primarily by lysing bacteria. Phages can also impact abiotic factors via the encoding of exotoxins (a subset of which are capable of solubilizing the biological tissues of living animals). Phage ecosystem ecologists are primarily concerned with the phage impact on the global carbon cycle, especially within the context of a phenomenon known as the microbial loop.

They are cut from the lower portion of the pig specifically the belly and breastbone, behind the shoulder, and include 11 to 13 long bones. There is a covering of meat on top of the bones and also between them. Spare ribs (pork) are distinguished from short ribs, which are beef. Terminology *Pork spare ribs are also popular in Chinese and American Chinese cuisine; they are generally called paigu (, Cantonese: paigwat; literally \\"row of bones\\"). *In County Cork, Ireland, pork or beef spare ribs are boiled and eaten with potatoes and turnips. This dish is called bodice locally. Preparation In Chinese cuisines Chinese spare ribs *In Chinese cuisine, pork spare ribs are generally first cut into sections, then may be fried, steamed, or braised. *In the Cantonese cuisine of southern China, spare ribs are generally red in color and roasted with a sweet and savory sauce. This variety of spare ribs is grouped as one of the most common items of siu mei, or Cantonese roasted meat dishes. *In American Chinese cuisine, pork spare ribs are generally cooked in char siu style, and often feature as a part of the appetizer dish called pu pu platter. In American South cuisine Spare ribs have also become popular in the American South. They are generally cooked on a barbecue or on an open fire, and are served as a slab (bones and all) with a sauce. American butchers prepare two cuts: outdoor grill *Pork spare ribs are taken from the belly side of the pig's rib cage above the sternum (breast bone) and below the back ribs which extend about 6\\" down from the spine. Spare ribs are flatter than the curved back ribs and contain more bone than meat. There is also quite a bit of fat which can make the ribs more tender than baby back ribs. **St. Louis Cut ribs are spare ribs where the sternum bone, cartilage, and the surrounding meat known as the rib tips have been removed. St. Louis Cut rib racks are almost rectangular. *Beef short ribs are taken from the belly side of the cattle's rib cage above the sternum (breast bone). Beef spare ribs tend to be longer, wider, and sometimes more curved than their pork counterparts, and are cut from the prime rib rump, of which the thicker boneless part becomes the ribeye steak, and the upper tips of the ribs are then cut off and become short ribs.

Early life and education  Cohen was from a distinguished Anglo-Jewish family. He was a descendant of Levy Barent Cohen, the founder of the oldest Ashkenazi family in Britain. He was educated at Malvern CollegeProfile of Andrew Benjamin Cohen. Nigeria, Part 2, by Martin Lynn, 2001, pp770. and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a Cambridge Apostle. Rhodesia and Nyasaland As Colonial Office Assistant Undersecretary for African Affairs, Cohen was involved in negotiations for a federal state for the Rhodesias and Nyasaland in 1950. The Jewish Cohen, traumatised by the Holocaust, was an anti-racialist and an advocate of African rights. However, he compromised his ideals to combat a threat that he perceived to be even more menacing: the risk that Southern Rhodesia, if it turned hostile, would fall into the orbit of the National Party government in South Africa. To Cohen, the risk of radical Afrikaner white supremacy posed a greater menace than the perpetuation of the less inflexible, paternalistic white ascendancy system of Southern Rhodesia. Having come to terms with this compromise, Cohen went on to become one of the central architects and driving forces behind the creation of the Federation, often seemingly single-handedly untangling deadlocks and outright walkouts on the part of the respective parties. The negotiations and conferences were indeed arduous. Southern Rhodesia and the Northern Territories had very different traditions when it came to the 'Native Question' (Africans) and the roles they were designed to play in civil society. Thus, it took nearly three years for the CAF to be established. And, once it was established, it proved to be \\"one of the most elaborately governed countries in the world.\\" Governor of Uganda In 1952 he was appointed Governor of Uganda, with the task of preparing that country for independence. He reorganised the Legislative Council (LEGCO) to include African representatives elected from districts throughout Uganda, thus creating the basis for a representative parliament. He also introduced economic initiatives, including the establishment of the Uganda Development Corporation. In 1953 the Lukiiko (Parliament) of Buganda sought independence from Uganda. Edward Mutesa II, the Kabaka (king) of Buganda demanded that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. On 30 November Cohen deposed the Kabaka and ordered his exile to London. His forced departure made the Kabaka an instant martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism and anticolonial sentiments set off a storm of protest. Cohen's action had backfired, and he could find no one among the Baganda prepared or able to mobilise support for his schemes. After two frustrating years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate \\"Kabaka Freddie\\". The Kabaka returned to Kampala on 17 October 1955. Abu Mayanja was among those who escorted Sir Edward Mutesa from his London exile in 1955. The negotiations leading to the Kabaka's return, although appearing to satisfy the British, were a resounding victory for the Baganda. Cohen secured the Kabaka's agreement not to oppose independence within the larger Uganda framework. Not only was the Kabaka reinstated in return, but for the first time since 1889, the monarch was given the power to appoint and dismiss his chiefs (Buganda government officials) instead of acting as a mere figurehead while they conducted the affairs of government. The Kabaka's new power was cloaked in the misleading claim that he would be only a \\"constitutional monarch,\\" while in fact he was a leading player in deciding how Uganda would be governed, and would become the country's first president in 1962. UN Trusteeship Council From 1957 Cohen was the UK representative to the United Nations Trusteeship Council. In 1959 he was a member of the Special Mission to Samoa to negotiate its independence from New Zealand. He was involved in the transfer of the Trust Territory of Southern Cameroons to the French-controlled state of the Cameroun Republic on 1 October 1961. Cohen had argued against offering independence to the territory, and pro-independence Southern Cameroonians blamed him for the fact that the UN did not allow that question to be put. Later life Cohen was Permanent Secretary of the Minister of Overseas Development from 1964 until his death from a heart attack in 1968.

It is Wales' oldest surviving theatre.  History  Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building was initially known as The Pavilion from 1883-1982, The Empire from 1892-1900, and then as The Palace in 1900 after a takeover by William Coutt, who also operated the city's Shaftesbury Hall, which was known as Swansea's \\"home of dancing\\" at the time. From 1912 it was known as the People's Bioscope Palace, bioscope being an early term for moving picture technology. In the early years of the 20th century stars like Charlie Chaplin, Lilly Langtry, Marie Lloyd and Dan Leno filled the venue. Chaplin only performed at the palace when he was 10 years old in 1896. The building is one of just two purpose-built music halls left standing in the whole of the UK. In the 1920s-30s the venue moved into holding live theatre events. It shifted into film from the 1930s to 1950s. Sir Anthony Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance there in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of 'Have A Cigarette'.BBC Morecambe and Wise performed at the venue in the 1960s, and Ken Dodd was the last stand- up comedian to appear there before it became nightclub in the 1970s. It was also the first place in Wales to show a silent picture and remained undamaged by the blitz that destroyed much of Swansea city centre during the Second World War. The venue also operated in its lifetime as a bingo hall, and as a private gay club. The ground floor bar and lounge was also used as a licensed pub for many years before closing in 2006. Eventually the theatre was sold for ¬£300,000 to a property company, but in 2010 it was still derelict and actor Edward Fox joined a campaign to have it restored.\\"Edward Fox bid to save historic Palace where Charlie Chaplin played\\", Wales Online, 7 Aug 2010.

Swansea Council cabinet member for regeneration Nick Bradley told the BBC that renovation would be very expensive, and as a result any Council or Government intervention was unlikely. He warned that regarding costs of redevelopment, \\"¬£1m wouldn't even touch it.\\" In 2014, a new campaign for redevelopment of the site was launched on Facebook.South Wales Evening Post High Street in 1915 In April 2014 Swansea Council made ¬£75,000The Stage available to the owners to carry out work on the High Street theatre, which had been named as one of the 10 most endangered Victorian and Edwardian buildings in England and Wales. The Victorian Society called it \\"a victim of urban decay\\". The council funds were earmarked for \\"emergency works\\", including making the building watertight, removing vegetation and removing loose brickwork that could be deemed ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù. By September 2014 the council issued a reminder to the owners that the work needed to be completed promptly.\\"Funding offer to help owners save Palace Theatre in Swansea\\", South Wales Evening Post, 8 September 2014. Accessed 6 Nov 2014 In 2018 the derelict theatre was identified as having become \\"at the hub of the city's street sex trade\\", after residents of High Street complained that they were no longer able to walk past the building in safety.The Theatre as of April 2020In July 2019 the future of the theatre was discussed as part of a public \\"Emergency Summit\\", organised by Swansea Council, South Wales Police, Geraint Davies MP, and voluntary sector organisations. The summit was prompted after a spate of incidents in the city including an assault on 20 July on High Street which saw the death of a 54 year old man. The city centre is witnessing investment and construction including two new schemes which will house an additional 1,000 students, but Swansea Council has stated it is yet to secure a development partner for the currently privately owned Theatre. According to the Theatres Trust it remained \\"in a poor state of repair and extremely vulnerable\\", although developments \\"provided hope that a viable solution, which includes community use and preserves the main body of the auditorium, could be found\\". In September 2019 the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service were called out to the theatre amid reports of smoke at the building, emitting from the ground and fourth floor windows. Responders dealt with a fire, but did not initially comment on whether the incident was unsuspicious. Late 2019 and early 2020 saw a plan emerge to save the former theatre. The plans would see it transformed into offices with community and performance space provided. As of 12th February 2020, only interior surveys have been carried out.

A prototype of Burmese stupas, it consists of a circular gold leaf-gilded stupa surrounded by smaller temples and shrines. Construction of the Shwezigon Pagoda began during the reign of King Anawrahta (r. 1044‚Äì77), the founder of the Pagan Empire, in 1059‚Äì1060 and was completed in 1102, during the reign of his son King Kyansittha. Over the centuries the pagoda had been damaged by many earthquakes and other natural calamities, and has been refurbished several times. In recent renovations it has been covered by more than 30,000 copper plates. However, the lowest level terraces have remained as they were. This pagoda, a Buddhist religious place, is believed to enshrine a bone and tooth of Gautama Buddha. The pagoda is in the form of a cone formed by five square terraces with a central solid core. There are footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here. Jataka legends are depicted on glazed terra-cotta tiles set into three rectangular terraces. At the entrance of the pagoda there are large statues of guardians of the temple. There are also four bronze standing statues of Buddha which are stated to be of the current age Buddha. At the outer limits of the pagoda there are 37 nats deified along with an intricately carved wooden sculpture of Thagyamin a Burmese version of Hindu god Indra. Within the compound of the Shwezigon Pagoda there is a stone pillar containing Mon language inscriptions dedicated by Kyansittha. Location The pagoda, a pilgrimage centre, is located close to Bagan or Pagan (known as \\"a land of thousand pagodas\\") in the plains in the Shwe Zigon settlement at Nyaung-U. History Shwezigon Pagoda in 1855 One year after earthquake 1975 Chronicles of the Kings of Burma have attributed that King Anawrahta (r. 1044‚Äì77) initiated its construction during 1059‚Äì1060. According to legend, Anawrahta selected the site for building this pagoda by sending a white elephant mounted with a frontal bone relic of the Buddha to roam freely with the declaration that wherever the elephant stopped would be the site for building the pagoda. The elephant finally stopped over a dune which was chosen as the site for erecting the pagoda, and hence the name Shwezigon pagoda meaning \\"golden pagoda on a dune\\" in Burmese. Pagoda means \\"stupa\\" or \\"zedi.\\" The pagoda was then completed by his son King Kyansittha (r.1084‚Äì1112/13). While its lower terraces were built by Anawrahta, the balance structure is credited to Kyansittha. Its final completion date is 1086 and the footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here are also believed to be of the same period. The pagoda is a replica of the pyramidal Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location of Buddha's illuminating realisation in India. Buddhist monks at Shwezigon Pagoda in 1999 The pagoda has been damaged by earthquakes and other natural calamities over the centuries, and has been refurbished from time to time. A notable renovation was carried out by King Bayinnaung (r. 1550‚Äì1581) during late 16th century. In the 1975 earthquake there was considerable damage to the spire and the dome necessitating large renovation. It is now substantially strengthened with covering of more than 30,000 copper plates, which were donated by local and international devotees; gilding of the dome has been done during 1983‚Äì1984 and again in recent times. However, the pagoda's bottom level terraces have remained mostly in their original form. Features Buddha The pagoda, a prototype of Burmese stupas, is like a bell- shaped stupa in traditional Mon people, which became the prototype architectural feature for many stupas built in the then Burma (now Myanmar). It has features of staircases, gates, and a richly ornamented spire fitted with a large golden umbrella type finial embedded with gems. The relics that are believed to be enshrined in the pagoda are Buddha's collar-bone and his frontal bone from Prome, and his tooth from Ceylon. On the outer limits of the pagoda there is a shrine where 37 nats are deified along with an intricately carved wooden sculpture of Thagyamin, Buddhist deva ≈öakra, king of the nats, which is believed to be 900 years old; it is the Burmese version of the Indian god Indra holding his weapon, the thunderbolt. These shrines of 37 nat spirits have been built to circumambulate as a homage to these relics. The pagoda, which rises with five square terraces has a central solid core. The terraces rise steeply in the form of a pyramid topped with umbrellas or chatris. The entire edifice, from the base to the tip, appears like a cone. From the four cardinal directions there are steps from the base to the terraces at the centre to provide access to devotees to go up for worship; these terraces are fitted with instructions on slabs narrating events from the life of Buddha and other Buddhist scriptures. The interior, though conceived as a solid body, has a maze of interconnected narrow passages, where devotees affix dedicatory slabs on the walls by paying a donation, praying for special blessings. Even though the relics have not been found in the pagoda, believed to have been stolen, devotees still feel the sanctity of the stupa and embed slabs hoping to attain nirvana from the \\"force field\\" created by the embedded relics. Exterior decorations At the entrance to the pagoda there are huge statues of guardians of the temple, known as chinthes which are leoglyphs (lion shaped glyphs). Out of the four entrances to the pagoda only the southern and western ones are in use. There are 550 glazed terra-cotta tiles inscribed with the Jataka tales fixed on three of the five terraces of the pagoda; the earlier count was 584 tiles of which some are not found now. The four flights of steps which provide access to the terraces leading to an octagonal platform over which the gilded stupa has been built. At the four corners of the top most terrace, smaller replicas of the main pagoda are affixed at their back side, fitted with four gilded kalashas or vases; similar replicas are also fixed at the corners in the lower terraces. At the base of the pagoda there are containers fitted closely and set in series, which have gilded bronze castings of plants and flowers, with alms bowls carved in stone in between. Around the exterior periphery of the pagoda there are several temples and wooden pavilions decorated with the pyatthat (multi-tiered and spired roofs). The pagoda houses footprints of Buddha. There are four bronze standing statues of Buddha which are in height, which are stated to be of the current age Buddha deified on the four sides of the temple; these four are Kakusandha in the northern face, Konagamana in the eastern wall, Kassapa in the southern wall and the Gautama Buddha to the west wall. All of these Buddhas are cast in beaten bronze and seen with their right hand in a posture of abhayamudra, meaning \\"the fear not gesture\\" and left hand holding the monk's robe. Below the Buddha Kassapa statue there are a pair of footprints intricately carved on sandstone slab; these were carved from a large \\"Bodhi-leaf-shaped\\" slab. They have engravings of a chakra at the centre, which is considered an auspicious symbol. Devotees offer oblations to the footprints through a rectangular wedge created at the rear of the stone slab. The placing of the footprints gives the viewers an impression of Buddha walking towards them. On one of the outer walls surrounding the Shwezigon Pagoda there is a stone pillar with Mon language inscriptions dedicated by King Kyansittha.

The current United States Attorney is Timothy A. Garrison. History Charles Evans Whittaker Federal Courthouse Missouri was admitted as a state on August 10, 1821, and the United States Congress established the United States District Court for the District of Missouri on March 16, 1822.U.S. District Courts of Missouri, Legislative history, Federal Judicial Center.3 Stat. 653. The District was assigned to the Eighth Circuit on March 3, 1837.5 Stat. 176. Congress subdivided it into Eastern and Western Districts on March 3, 1857.11 Stat. 197. and has since made only small adjustments to the boundaries of that subdivision. The division was prompted by a substantial increase in the number of admiralty cases arising from traffic on the Mississippi River, which had followed an act of Congress passed in 1845 and upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1851, extending federal admiralty jurisdiction to inland waterways. These disputes involved \\"contracts of affreightment, collisions, mariners' wages, and other causes of admiralty jurisdiction\\", and litigants of matters arising in St. Louis found it inconvenient to travel to Jefferson City for their cases to be tried. When the District of Missouri was subdivided, Robert William Wells was the sole judge serving the District of Missouri. Wells was then reassigned to serve only the Western District.  Jurisdiction  The district is divided into five divisions: Western (Kansas City), Central (Jefferson City), Southern (Springfield), Southwestern (Joplin), and St. Joseph (St. Joseph). There are divisional clerk's Offices in Jefferson City and Springfield in addition to the primary office in Kansas City. New cases and pleadings in the District Court may be filed in the clerk's offices in Kansas City, Jefferson City, and Springfield; Bankruptcy Court filings, however, only are accepted in the Kansas City clerk's office. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit across Missouri in St. Louis has jurisdiction over decisions appealed from the Western District of Missouri (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). The five court divisions each cover the following counties: The Western Division covers Bates, Carroll, Cass, Clay, Henry, Jackson, Johnson, Lafayette, Ray, St. Clair, and Saline counties. The Central Division covers Benton, Boone, Callaway, Camden, Cole, Cooper, Hickory, Howard, Miller, Moniteau, Morgan, Osage, and Pettis counties. The Southern Division covers Cedar, Christian, Dade, Dallas, Douglas, Greene, Howell, Laclede, Oregon, Ozark, Polk, Pulaski, Taney, Texas, Webster, and Wright counties. The St. Joseph Division covers Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Caldwell, Clinton, Daviess, DeKalb, Gentry, Grundy, Harrison, Holt, Livingston, Mercer, Nodaway, Platte, Putnam, Sullivan, and Worth counties.

His primary contributions centred on pioneering supersonic British experimental aircraft and as the chief designer who shepherded Canada's first jet fighter project, the Avro Canada CF-100, to completion. He was also the major force behind the Avro Canada VTOL aircraft projects, particularly as the unheralded creator of the Avro Canada flying saucer projects. Early life Frost's introduction to aviation had begun when he was a teenager. At school in the early 1930s his Latin teacher A. Maitland Emmet had taken him up in a Bristol Fighter. John Frost had been born in Walton-on-Thames near London in 1915 and had shown an early interest in the sciences at St Edward's School, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in mathematics, chemistry and physics. Aviation career First designs  Frost began his aeronautical career in the 1930s as an apprentice for Airspeed Limited before he moved on to the Miles, Westland, Blackburn and Slingsby companies. In 1937, Frost had designed the fuselage of the new Westland Whirlwind fighter. At Blackburn, he had been involved with the design and construction of their pre-war wind tunnel. While working for Slingsby Sailplanes from 1939 to 1942, he met his future wife, Joan, who had worked in the Slingsby Design Office as a technical artist. Frost designed the Slingsby Hengist, a troop-carrying glider to be used for the Normandy landings. It was not a success and only a few were built but it included an ingenious innovation: the use of a rubber bag undercarriage. de Havilland Frost's work began to be noticed when he joined the de Havilland Aircraft Company (UK), builders of the famed Mosquito bomber and fighter. After joining the de Havilland firm in 1942, Frost had become one of the senior members of the design team working on the Hornet fighter, based on the Mosquito, for which he designed a unique flap design. Later, as one of the team of designers on the D.H.100 Vampire, he was responsible for the design of the original flaps, dive brakes and ailerons for this fighter. The Vampire was the second British jet fighter designed in the Second World War, but other than its powerplant and plywood construction patterned on the Mosquito, the diminutive fighter was mainly conventional in design. anti-spin parachutes de Havilland DH.108 Swallow Frost had then become heavily involved in one of the most important new developments at the time: swept wings and a tailless configuration on a supersonic jet fighter. Designer and company founder, Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, had already begun the D.H.106 Comet development process and was considering that radical configuration for the world's first jet airliner. As Project Engineer on the D.H.108, with only a team of 8‚Äì10 draughtsmen and engineers, Frost created a remarkable aircraft by marrying the front fuselage of the de Havilland Vampire to a swept wing and short stubby vertical tail to make the first British swept wing jet, soon to be unofficially known as the \\"Swallow.\\" The elegant and sleek experimental D.H.108 was also to serve as a test \\"mule\\" to investigate stability and control problems for the new Comet airliner. The D.H.108 first flew on 15 May 1946, a mere eight months after Frost had a go-ahead on the project. Company test pilot and son of the builder, Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., flew the first of three aircraft and found it extremely fast ‚Äì fast enough to try for a world speed record. On 12 April 1948, a D.H.108 did set a world's speed record at 973.65 km/h (605 mph) and later on became the first jet aircraft to exceed the speed of sound. The first D.H.108, TG-283, was alleged to have suddenly jumped from Mach .98 to Mach 1.05 while being test-flown by John Derry on 9 September 1948. On 27 September 1946, while practising for an upcoming run at a new speed record, Geoffrey de Havilland Jr. died when his D.H.108 broke up in the air at or near the speed of sound. Avro Canada Frost was persuaded to move to Canada in 1947, shortly after the completion of the design of the Swallow, where he joined A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada). To him, this was an ideal opportunity ‚Äì there was a promising project to work on and a chance to get away from the depressing conditions of postwar Britain. At the time, his wife, Joan, was living in the north of England while Frost worked at Hatfield, near London. Accommodations for many young couples were similarly strained. During his tenure at de Havilland, Frost began to put forward a number of unique ideas for a tip jet-driven rotor helicopter ‚Äì a concept also known as a gyrodyne. He continued his research privately and with a group of friends, including fellow engineer, T. Desmond Earl, built a scale model to test his theories. Shortly after his departure to Canada, Earl joined Frost in his new venture, and remained his \\"right-hand man\\" for the rest of the Canadian period. XC-100 / CF-100 jet fighter On 14 June 1947, Frost arrived at Avro Canada's Malton, Ontario facility with his wife to take over as Project Designer of the new XC-100 jet fighter interceptor. After 18 months of development, the fighter had entered the mock-up stage. Frost decided to alter the aircraft design which immediately brought him into conflict with Avro Canada Chief Aerodynamacist Jim Chamberlin. Basically \\"cleaning up\\" the fuselage, Frost set out to change the design subtly. Even though he wanted to use a swept-wing configuration, the prototype (by now called the CF-100 Canuck) proceeded to prototype stage in the same basic configuration of straight-winged, twin-engined form. (The swept-wing CF-103 proposed by Frost in December 1950 was a transonic follow-up to the CF-100). Although the CF-100 prototype was now a much more sleek shape, Frost still considered the design awkward. \\"It was a clumsy thing. All brute force,\\" he remarked.\\"Retiring Designer Leaves Stamp in Aviation World.\\" 1979 While Frost was in England to confer with members of the Hawker Siddeley Group, Chamberlin made another alteration by moving the engines back and \\"notching\\" the wing spar to accommodate the change. The weakened spar was a flexible structure where the stress was heavy leading to potentially dangerous situations with the CF-100. A CF-100 Mk.3 painted as the CF-100 prototype, on display at the Calgary AeroSpace Museum. Gloster's Chief Test pilot Bill Waterton flew with Frost in the second seat; to the test pilot, this was a revelation: \\"(Frost was)...very much the keen English public schoolboy type. Here was another delightful contrast to England, where I was never able to find a designer with spare time enough to fly in his own creation.\\" Waterton 1955, p. 169. Frost considered it important to get a feel for the aircraft and its systems. He even tested the CF-100's ejection seat by becoming a test subject himself. Early flights revealed the great potential of the aircraft but also showed the flaw in the spar was dangerous. With the crash of the second CF-100 prototype and early production CF-100s delivered to the RCAF without the final modifications to the spar, Frost was blamed for the delays and removed as CF-100 Project Designer in early 1952. Special Projects Group Frost made a proposal that Avro start an experimental project based on vertical takeoff and landing concepts. \\"It was not a case of Frost indulging in a personal whim. The idea of a saucer-like flying machine had revolutionary implications then and still does. A conventional aircraft is very inefficient, aerodynamically. Like a bumble bee, there's no way it should fly. It only does so because of the wing which gives it lift and the engine's power to overcome the drag of the fuselage, the load, the tailplane, the stabilizers, fins and the engines.\\"Williams 1976 Shortly after its formation in 1952, Frost's Special Projects Group started a paper study on a \\"pancake\\" engine, a jet turbine that had its main components arranged in a circular design. From the outset, the Special Projects Group had a cloak-and-dagger feel to it. Housed in a Second World War-era structure, across from the company headquarters, the group had all the accoutrements of a top-secret operation, including security guards, locked doors and special pass cards. Within the confines of this technical fortress, Frost surrounded himself with a collection of like-minded dreamers and maverick engineers. There he encouraged close cooperation and, while ostensibly the boss, he was collegial and very much one of the boys. =Project Y= Project Y mock-up c.1954. Research undertaken by Frost on the \\"CoandƒÉ effect\\" confirmed that the concept of ground cushion could be the basis for a vehicle he had envisioned that could have both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities and could still operate as a high-performance aircraft. As Frost developed further studies, his ideas on revolutionary vertical takeoff systems led to the patent of \\"Aircraft Propulsion and Control\\".U.S. Patent Serial No. 3124323, Filed 7 March 1963. In 1952, \\"Project Y\\", a \\"spade-shaped\\" fighter powered by Frost's revolutionary pancake engine proceeded to mock-up stage. By 1953, with the company having little more than a wooden mock-up, paper drawings and promises to show for a $4-million (Cdn) outlay, a more critical eye was cast on the project. Not surprisingly, the plug got pulled when government funding from the Defence Research Board dried up. =The American connection: Project Y-2 / Weapons Systems 606A / VZ-9-AV Avrocar= The Avro VZ-9-AV Avrocar. Frost's later ideas revolved around a disk or saucer shape ‚Äì a \\"flying saucer\\" and resulted in a number of patents in Great Britain, the United States and Canada on the unique concepts of propulsion, control and stabilisation systems that were incorporated. Frost continued to lobby for the project now called the \\"Y-2\\" and achieved a remarkable breakthrough by demonstrating the project to the United States Air Force. With funding from the Americans, Frost was able to proceed with his research. From 1955 to 1959, the design team concentrated on the new VTOL supersonic studies known as Weapon Systems 606A which Avro Canada continued to support through an associated private venture program, the PV-704 which resulted in the construction of an engine test rig in 1957. The PV-704 supersonic test model, powered by six Armstrong-Siddeley Viper jet engines driving a central rotor, was built and housed inside a small, brick testing rig. The test model was abandoned in favour of a simpler flying model led to the only design that materialised from the Avro Special Project Group, a \\"proof-of-concept\\" vehicle, the VZ-9-AV \\"Avrocar\\". Two Avrocar prototypes were constructed and completed a series of wind tunnel tests at NASA Ames in California and a 75-hour flying program at the Malton home of Avro Canada. The results of the testing revealed a stability problem and degraded performance due to turbo-rotor tolerances. Before modifications could be achieved, funding ran out with the final flight test program completed in March 1961. As the result of his work in vertical takeoff systems, John Frost was invited to become a fellow of the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute after he presented the W. Rupert Turnbull seventh lecture on 25 May 1961. The citation noted that Frost had discovered and patented the air cushion effect that had been evident in his work on flying saucers and that U.S. Patent #3124323 \\"Aircraft Propulsion and Control\\" was one of a series of US, Canadian and British patents to become known as the \\"Frost patents.\\" New Zealand With the end of the Avrocar project, he left A. V. Roe Canada early in 1962. In the wake of the cancellation of its premier fighter program, the CF-105 Avro Arrow by the Canadian government, Avro Canada was unable to survive, being broken up on 30 April 1962. Like many of the former employees of A.V. Roe Canada, John Frost began a new career when he left the company. He left Canada for New Zealand in 1964 where he again became part of the aviation industry; first joining the airworthiness section of the Civil Aviation Authority where he headed the certification of the Waitomo PL-11 Airtruck, the first commercial aircraft developed in New Zealand. During this period, Frost also designed the Murray Air, an agricultural biplane. Later in 1965, Frost became a technical services engineer for Air New Zealand, serving in that position for 13 years until his retirement in April 1978. His time at Air New Zealand was very fulfilling. He was responsible for all technical activities at the airline's engineering headquarters at Mangere, New Zealand. All \\"Air New Zealand aircraft are showcases for the Frost ingenuity.\\" (Daily News New Zealand, April 1978). The unique swivelling bassinets attached to the airliner's hat racks are his design along with locks that hold down pallets in the cargo hold, air-conditioning systems for the cargo bay, rest seats for air crew, toilet tap washers and gallery plugs. His most impressive design was a gigantic hydraulically operated tail dock system. After retirement, he continued to explore many areas. He became involved in an aviation project ‚Äì designing and constructing, with the assistance of university students at Auckland, a human-powered aircraft. He would not see his EMME 1 fly. Death Frost died from a heart attack in Auckland, New Zealand on 9 October 1979 at the age of 63. Legacy His last creation did fly, albeit towed behind a car, and the EMME 1 is now under restoration for display at the Museum of Transport and Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.

Stadler has compiled four anthologies about literature, city life and public life. His essays, which have been published in magazines and museum catalogs, focus on architecture, urban planning and sprawl. \\"Sprawl is the disappearance of an idea\\", Stadler wrote in the annotated reader Where We Live Now. \\"So how can we go on speaking of the city and the country, yet not remain fixed in the downward spiral of loss?\\"Stadler, Matthew: Where We Live Now, www.suddenly.org, 2008 Stadler's essays and larger projects explore this question by looking for better language and new descriptions. While there is significant overlap, Stadler's work can usefully be broken down into three areas: novels; sprawl and urbanism; publishing and public space. Novels Between 1990 and 2000, Stadler published four novels that focus on children, sexuality, and art: Landscape: Memory (1990); The Dissolution of Nicholas Dee (1993); The Sex Offender (1994); and Allan Stein (1999).Bawer, Bruce: Reading at Risk to Ourselves: The Novels of Matthew Stadler , The Hudson Review, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Spring 1999), pp. 157-166 These books were widely discussed and lauded as gay fiction, including the 1999 Lambda Award for Best Gay Novel, for Allan Stein.Canning, Richard: Hear Us Out: Conversations with Gay Novelists, Columbia University Press, 2004 After co-founding Publication Studio in 2009, Stadler went on to use this platform to publish a so-called \\"cover novel,\\" Chloe Jarren‚Äôs La Cucaracha (2011),http://www.themillions.com/2011/07/on- coincidence-constraints-and-matthew-stadler%E2%80%99s-cover-novel.html as well as the dystopian novel Minders (2015).https://www.facebook.com/events/1628305487420783/ Reviewing Allan Stein in the New York Times, Edmund White wrote, \\"What makes Allan Stein unusual is the lyric suppleness and restraint of the writing, a kind of mandarin American casualness that is peculiar to such West Coast writers as Dennis Cooper, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian and Robert Gluck, a school of refined but deceptively offhand stylists. Matthew Stadler is its newest star. In Allan Stein we encounter the trademark passages of stark beauty...With it Stadler demonstrates that he is among the handful of first-rate young American novelists, one with a wide reach and a quirky, elegant pen.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/21/books/sex-and-the-city.html. Sprawl and urbanism In the early 1990s, while living in Groningen, the Netherlands, to research his novel, The Dissolution of Nicholas Dee, Stadler was invited to take part in an architectural conference at the Technical University at Delft. Through this conference and subsequent invitations to write about architecture for the Dutch journal Wiederhal, Stadler became involved in that country's discussion of urban planning and design. At a 1993 conference in Rotterdam, called Bliss, Stadler was asked to respond to Rem Koolhaas's recently published \\"Manifesto for Bigness.\\" In his talk, subsequently published as \\"I Think I'm Dumb,\\" Stadler characterized the sprawl of the American West Coast as \\"the native home for bigness,\\" and endorsed it as a productive, urban landscape. Many of the subsequent themes in Stadler's work on sprawl and urbanism can be found in this initial essay.Stadler, Matthew: I Think I‚Äôm Dumb, The Raven Chronicles, 1998 In \\"I Think I'm Dumb\\" Stadler writes that the borderless West Coast city \\"feels like material scattered around in space or like electronic information. The huge glass boxes downtown could easily be kicked over, like models pumped up with growth hormones, huge and brittle air. Walking down the hill from where I live to downtown is like walking over a scab. The interstate freeway‚Ä¶has twelve lanes and cuts right through the middle of the city. It goes from Canada to Mexico.\\" But rather than condemning this landscape as a failure, Stadler asserts that \\"this place has given rise to a peculiar, dumb and lovely pattern of work that [as Rem K ponders in his manifesto] 'reconstructs the whole' and is doing something with the collective (it's hard to describe exactly what that is), plus it sheds some light on 'the real.'\\" (Here Stadler links sprawl to the three positive capacities that Koolhaas's manifesto ascribes to Bigness.) Stadler's inclination to look for positive potentials in the shapeless new landscapes of sprawl matured over the next decade as he read (and published) the essays of the poet Lisa Robertson. Writing as the Office for Soft Architecture, Robertson pursued what she calls lyrical research into the new, dynamic forms of cities, especially her home (then) of Vancouver, B.C., Canada.Robertson, Lisa: Occasional Work and Seven Walks from the Office for Soft Architecture Clear Cut Press, 2003 Robertson's evocations of \\"this permanent transience, the buildings or shelters like tents‚Äîtents of steel, chipboard, stucco, glass, cement, paper, and various claddings‚Äîtents rising and falling in the glittering rhythm which is null rhythm, which is the flux of modern careers...\\" helped Stadler understand how writing can transform degraded landscapes into sites of meaning and beauty.Stadler, Matthew: lisa robertson and hadley + maxwell , Back Room, 2007 This insight was confirmed and persuasively theorized by German urban planner Thomas Sieverts in his book, Zwischenstadt, which came into English in 1997 as Cities Without Cities. Stadler's encounter with Sieverts's work in 2003, catalyzed the analysis of cities and sprawl that he ultimately published in the annotated reader, Where We Live Now.Stadler, Matthew: Losing You Might Be the Best Thing Yet - What Has Become of Cities, The Stranger, May 17, 2006 Where We Live Now is a collection of urban theory, historical documents, and literature that makes three simple arguments: (1) Thomas Sieverts's description of what he calls \\"zwischenstadt\\" (literally the \\"in-between city\\") is a useful, accurate description of the built environment that has displaced the old concentric city; (2) this condition, of a densely inhabited in-between landscape, has a deep history in North America, predating the arrival of European explorers, which can be usefully articulated if we study indigenous history in the Americas as urban history; and (3), that new literature which springs from this history can help us occupy the in-between landscapes fully and well. These three arguments ‚Äî advocacy for the relevance of Sieverts's analysis; an insistence that indigenous history is urban history; and a faith in the power of literature to shape an urban future ‚Äî form the core of Stadler's work on urbanism and sprawl. Publishing and public space At a 2008 lecture in Vitoria, Spain, Stadler described publication as \\"the creation of a public ... There is no preexisting public,\\" he went on. \\"The public is created through deliberate, willful acts: the circulation of texts, discussions and gatherings in physical space, and the maintenance of a related digital commons. These construct a common space of conversation, a public space, which beckons a public into being. This publication in its fullest sense.\\" Stadler, Matthew: \\"Matthew Stadler asks: What is Publication? Montehermoso art center, Vitoria, Spain\\", Suddenly.org, 9/27/08. Stadler maintains that the public we think of when we speak of \\"public opinion\\" or \\"mainstream\\" is the manufactured product of special interests that use the publication to conjure a public that \\"can justify their own self-interests.\\" He cites the example of the \\"public will\\" conjured by the US government and news media to support that country's 2003 invasion of Iraq. Publication \\"is always a political act,\\" Stadler argues. It is \\"imperative that we publish\\" not only as a means to counter the influence of a hegemonic \\"public,\\" but also to reclaim the space in which we imagine ourselves and our collectivity. \\"We feel lonely and powerless when we accept the myth of 'the mainstream public.' When we accept that fiction we relinquish our ability to form our own collectivities and draw hope from them.\\" A year before Stadler's first novel was released, he began to run a writing class at his kitchen table in Seattle. He met there several writers, artists, and scientists including Lee Hartwell and Frances McCue. That same year, McCue and poet Jan Wallace had founded a reading series, The Rendezvous Room Reading Series, to bridge the gap between academic writers at the University of Washington and the underground writers of The Red Sky Poetry Theatre.Gilovich, Paula: The Rendezvous Reader: Northwest Writing Tenth Avenue East Publishing, 2003 Stadler joined them as a co-director of the series. \\"One thing led to another, and before long we were organizing classes for writers and artists in a self-generating night school called The Extension Project,\\" Stadler wrote in the introduction to an unpublished manuscript.http://slog.thestranger.com/2007/01/post_114 During this time Stadler began to publish his novels, which were placed with large New York-based publishers, Charles Scribner's Sons, Harper-Collins, and Grove Press. He also wrote for widely distributed, New York-based journals such as the New York Times, the New York Times Magazine, Spin Magazine, the Village Voice, and many others. But frustration with the narrow interests at this publication led Stadler to focus on small \\"start-up\\" journals and zines closer to home, where he was able to develop concerns and a writing style that were not in fashion with the editors he knew at the larger New York-based journals. In 1994, he joined a fledgling weekly newspaper in Seattle, The Stranger, and became their first books editor, founding a books quarterly and bringing accomplished poets and prose writers such as Eileen Myles, Charles D'Ambrosio, Lisa Robertson, Kevin Killian, Bruce Benderson, and Stacey Levine to write for the paper. In 1996 he became the first (and only) literary editor for Nest Magazine, an idiosyncratic interiors magazine, founded and directed by Joseph Holtzman, that Stadler described as \\"a really beautiful zine run by a millionaire.\\" Nest, where Stadler assigned and edited all of the texts throughout the magazine's six-year run, won the National Magazine Awards for General Excellence and for Design and was widely acclaimed as, in architect Rem Koolhaas's words, \\"an anti-materialistic, idealistic magazine about the hyper-specific in a world that is undergoing radical leveling, an 'interior design' magazine hostile to the cosmetic.\\"Holtzman, Joseph: Every Room Tells a Story: Tales from the Pages of Nest Magazine, A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, 2001 Many of the writers Stadler published at The Stranger and Nest had books they could not get published, so in 2001 he co-founded Clear Cut Press, a small independent press, with Rich Jensen, the former president of Sub Pop Records and co-founder of Up Records. Clear Cut Press applied the viral, community-based marketing that Jensen had used to cultivate audiences for music at Sub Pop and Up to promote new books by the authors Stadler had been publishing at Nest and The Stranger. The press hosted festive public gatherings that blended readings with live music by friends of the press, including Phil Elverum, Jona Bechtolt (YACHT), Black Cat Orchestra, Lou Barlow, and many others. The events were meant to \\"cultivate a long-term conversation that makes a community of readers,\\" Stadler said in a 2004 interview.Womack, Andrew: Clear Cut Press, The Morning News, July 2004 The books, printed in a uniform trim size and designed by Tae Won Yu, were distributed primarily by subscription. \\"[We] ship a book out of the warehouse if we feel confident that it will reach a reader,\\" Stadler continued. \\"That means (1) shipping to those who have already paid (subscribers and online orders); (2) shipping to stores that know CCP well and will shepherd the books to readers; (3) shipping to distributors who know CCP well‚Ä¶\\" Clear Cut Press published nine books in runs of 2000 ‚Äì 4000 and sold out most of its runs with a less-than-one percent return rate, virtually unheard of in commercial publishing (industry average is 45% return rate). In April 2005, Stadler and Clear Cut author Matt Briggs organized the Unassociated Writers Conference and Dance Party as \\"part party, part architectural experiment, part performance, part song and dance,\\" the conference promoted an alternative literary culture of zines, micro presses and project-based publishing.\\"http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20996 In 2004 Clear Cut Press sponsored a dinner for its subscribers in Portland, Oregon, collaborating with a restaurant group called Ripe. The evening included live music, readings, a film, and food and drink. Stadler later asked Ripe's owners, Michael Hebb and Naomi Pomeroy, to appoint him as a \\"writer in residence\\" for Ripe. In exchange for food and drink he would write essays and program a monthly series of \\"presentations/symposia/bacchanals replete with food, drink, music, and general boisterousness garlanding the central pleasure of bright intellects voicing their excellent texts, winging it in conversation, and screening or presenting various textual and visual delights.\\" http://www.josephoregon.travel/podcasts/the-back-room-pdx The result was the back room, an ongoing series of dinners and conversations with associated commissions for new publications. As of 2008, the back room has held over 30 events (with such guests as Gore Vidal, Aaron Peck, Gregory Crewdson, Anne Focke, Mary Gaitskill, Lisa Robertson, Lawrence Rinder, and Aaron Betsky) and commissioned more than a dozen new essays, publishing eight chapbooks and one 500-page anthology, which are distributed worldwide.http://www.thebackroompdx.com Broad interest in the Clear Cut Press modelhttp://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-13/books/the-kindest-cut/ and the back room eventshttp://www.portlandmercury.com/visualart/back-room- sessions/Content?oid=35311 led Stadler, in 2005, to found the Using Global Media workshop, a seminar of sorts that functions as a laboratory for exploring what he calls \\"the ecology of publication\\" (that is, the combination of printed texts with public gatherings and an associated digital commons). The workshop convenes as a group of a dozen or so, periodically; and it grows by convening in distant places where new members can join, whenever circumstances allow.http://www.usingglobalmedia.com The publication project called suddenly developed from conversations with the curator, Stephanie Snyder, who directed the back room and joined the Using Global Media workshop in 2006. The suddenly web site is authored by another workshop member, Sergio Pastor. Stadler chose to publish suddenly's central document, a 500-page annotated reader, Where We Live Now, with the print-on-demand site, Lulu. Suddenly distributes the book by programming public conversations in many cities around the world,http://www.highlinetimes.com/articles/2009/07/02/news/local_news/news01.txt so that rather than having a large reservoir of printed copies that must be stored until they are pushed out through market pipelines, suddenly cultivates conversations that then draw the books out one-by-one from the printer, like sponges drawing water. In September 2009 he co-founded Publication Studio,http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2009/10/publishing_becomes_a_social_ex.html a print-on-demand publisher that prints and binds books by hand in a Portland, Ore., storefront, \\"creating original work with artists and writers we admire, books that both respond to the conversation of the moment and can endure. We attend to the social life of the book, cultivating a public that cares and is engaged. Publication Studio is a laboratory for publication in its fullest sense ‚Äî not just the production of books, but the production of a public.\\"http://publicationstudio.biz/about/ Among the writers and artists published by Publication Studio are Lawrence Rinder, Walter Benjamin, Ari Marcopoulos, Lisa Robertson, Thomas Sieverts, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, and Matt Briggs.
