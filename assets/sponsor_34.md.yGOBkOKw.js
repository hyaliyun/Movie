Along with the serimpi, the bedhaya epitomized the elegant () character of the royal court, and the dance became an important symbol of the ruler's power. The bedhaya has different forms in the two court cities, the bedhaya Ketawang in Surakarta (Solo), and the bedhaya Semang in Yogyakarta, the latter of which has not been performed for more than 20 years. The Solonese dance continues to be performed once per year, on the second day of the Javanese month of Ruwah (during May in the Gregorian calendar), to commemorate the ascension of the current Susuhunan (prince) of Surakarta. Nine females, relatives or wives of the Susuhunan, perform the dance before a private audience. An invitation to anyone outside of the inner circle of the court is a considerable honor.Becker, 143. History Sultan of Yogyakarta, c. 1876 Some kind of female dance known as bedhaya existed on Java at least as early as the Majapahit Empire.Becker, 116. Indeed, some of the steps of the modern dance are said to be as old as the 3rd century.Knutsson, accessed on June 29, 2006. However, the modern form is traditionally dated to the court of Sultan Agung of Mataram (reigned 1613‚Äì1645). Unfortunately there is almost no historical evidence to back up the claims made about the advances in the arts in Sultan Agung's courts, and the existence of the dance is not clearly documented until the late 18th century.Sumarsam, 20 and 54. There are many myths which explain the origin of the dance, which generally have either an account of a meeting with an Indic deity (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, or the Buddha), or the meeting of Kangjeng Ratu Kidul, the Goddess of the South Sea, meeting with a founder of the Mataram dynasty, either Sultan Ageng or his grandfather, Senapati. In the former, the nine dancers were the creation of a deity, who were brought to life, and offered the dance to their maker in gratitude. In the latter, the dance was created when Kangjeng Ratu Kidul fell in love with the sultan, and danced the bedhaya for him; the nine dancers in the modern dance represent the spirit of the goddess.Becker, 119‚Äì124. Since the decline in the power of the royal courts, other, more accessible forms of bedhaya have become popular, not as religious ritual, but as artistic performance. These do not require the royal presence, and may be performed on stage for an admission fee. They frequently recount stories used in wayang.Becker, 141‚Äì142. Dance The dance is held in a pendhapa, a pillared audience hall with a peaked roof, with the Susuhunan on a throne in the middle of the room. The dance is performed in three large sections. In each section, the dancers emerge from a room behind the audience hall, approach the throne single file, dance in front of the throne, and then retreat, again single file. They approach and retreat on opposite sides of the throne, thus circumambulating the throne in a clockwise direction, the appropriate direction for veneration in Buddhist and Shaivist traditions. A name and number is given to each of the nine dancers, which designate a specific position in the changing choreographic pattern. There are slight variations between different sources in the names and numbers of the dancers, but there is consensus on the general forms. They are: a human being, representing ta·πáhƒÅ (the word for desire or craving in Buddhism), four chakras (the top three of which are used as note names; see slendro), and the four limbs:Becker, 132, citing K.G.P.H. Hadiwidjojo, Bedhaya Ketawang: Tarian Sakral di Candi-candi, Jakarta: Balai Pustaka, 1981, p. 20; Soedarsono, Wayang Wong in the Yogyakarta Kraton: History, Ritual Aspects, Literary Aspects, and Characterization, Ph.D. dissertation, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1983, p. 148; and N.

The first position is in the shape of a human being, with the first five dancers in a line down the middle, and those representing the right and left sides in front and behind (from the perspective of the Susuhunan), respectively. In the second position, the dancers divide into two facing groups, the arms and desire to one side, and the chakras and legs on the other. In the third section of the dance, there is an added section of an encounter between the desire and head dancers in the second position, while the other dancers squat. The third position places the dancers either in a row (Surakarta) or with the arms to one side (Yogyakarta), with desire in the middle. The final position is in a 3x3 grid (rakit tiga- tiga), with the three upper chakra centers in the middle column.Becker, 131-136. Music and text The dance is accompanied with the singing of men and women together. The style is known as sindhenan lampah sekar. Formerly only women sang; however since at least the 1940s men have also sung these parts. In Surakarta, instead of a full gamelan, the only instruments used are the colotomic instruments (kethuk, kenong, and gong), the kemanak, and drums (kendhang ketipung and gendhing); there are no balungan instruments and only sometimes other melodic instruments (such as gambang and gend√©r). In the Yogyakarta kraton, where the dance is no longer performed as ritual, the complete gamelan was used as accompaniment, sometimes even featuring cornets.Kunst, 128, 279-281 The pieces used to accompany the dances are traditionally gendhing with long structures (originally designated at least kethuk 4 arang; see gendhing for an explanation); however, shorter gendhings were also used later (such as kethuk 4 kerep or kethuk 2). The most ancient and sacred song is the Bedhaya Ketawang. When the bedhaya dancers appear on stage, in Yogyakarta it was accompanied by an ayak-ayakan; in Surakarta, it is only accompanied by a pathetan known as pathetan bedhaya, which has lost much of the rhythmic freedom associated with pathetans to fit better the stride of the dancers.Kunst, 330. The literary renaissance of Java in the 18th and 19th centuries, which greatly changed Javanese music, had as one of its first effects the creation of genres of gendhing to accompany bedhaya and serimpi, known as gendhing kemanak and gendhing bedhaya-serimpi. The former were based on a newly composed choral melody, while the latter fitted a new choral part into a pre-existing gendhing melody played by the gamelan. Hundreds of stanzas of text were written for these parts, and a particular gendhing uses at least a dozen. The texts are mainly in the form of a wangsalan (poetic riddle), and deal with a wide variety of subjects.Sumarsam, 96. Much of the text is erotic love poetry, describing the attraction of Kengjang Ratu Kidul to Sultan Agung.Becker, 128. Taboos There are many taboos regarding the performance and rehearsal of the Bedhaya ketawang, both the song and the dance associated with it. It is only allowed to be rehearsed every 35 days (when Thursday of the seven-day week coincides with Kliwon, the fifth day of the five-day week of the Javanese calendar), and performed on the anniversaries of the Susuhunan's accession to the throne. All rehearsals, and especially the performance, must be accompanied by offerings (many of which correspond to those specified in the Gandavyuha Sutra). The dancers must fast and undergo ritual purification, they must be in bridal dress and cover the upper part of their bodies in turmeric (bor√®h). When the text is copied, a few intentional mistakes are inserted to avoid copying a sacred text literally. This is all because during any performance or rehearsal, the deputies of Ratu Kidul are said to be present.Kunst, 151-152, 280; Becker 115-116.  Interpretation  The dance can be interpreted in a number of ways, including as an abstract sequence of positions, and a reenactment of the love between the goddess and a royal ancestor. Another common interpretation is that they symbolize military formations, which may explain why the dancers are given names of flanks. Furthermore, the dancers were brought onto battlefields with the Yogyakartan ruler.Sumarsam, 7; Becker, 141. Some of the choreographic positions are vaguely similar to those that were believed to have been used in the Kurukshetra war, the war in the Mahabharata, and some of the texts tell of military victories. Judith Becker provides a tantric interpretation. The first position shows desire plus the body; the second shows opposition between desire and the chakras (there is some evidence that the legs were considered a fifth chakra), and in the final section, interaction between the head and desire. Afterwards, desire is absorbed into the body, and then the dancers are arranged in the same arrangement as offerings in the Majapahit palace. Three is a number rich in Hindu symbolism, like the three pramanas, the Trilokya or the Trimurti, so a threefold set of three symbolizes completion and perfection.Becker, 136-141. In the 19th century, dancers held and fired pistols in the performance of the bedhaya.R. Atmadikrama, Babad Krama Dalem Ingkang Sinuhun Kangjeng Susuhunan Paku Buwana Kaping Sanga ing Nagari Surakarta Adniningrat (The chronicle of the marriage of his highness Susuhunan Paku Buwana IX of Surakarta), ms SMP KS 104/4, inscribed Surakarta, mid to late 19th century, p.59; cited in Sumarsam, 77. Sumarsam considered the meaning of the use of pistols an aristocratic attempt to adopt a foreign element to show enhance royal power, or the secularization and infomalization of the court ritual when in the presence of European guests.Sumarsam, 78. During some period in the 19th century, the dancers in Yogyakarta were young men dressed as women. The combination of characteristics of both sexes was thought to have a special spiritual power.

It is the administrative headquarters of Almora district. Almora is located on a ridge at the southern edge of the Kumaon Hills of the Himalaya range, at a distance of 363 km (via NH9) from the national capital New Delhi and 415 km via Saharanpur Rd, 351 km via NH109 and 388.6 km via Ambala- Dehradun- Haridwar Rd from the state capital Dehradun. According to the provisional results of the 2011 national census of India, Almora has a population of 35,513. Nestled within higher peaks of the Himalaya, Almora enjoys a year-round mild temperate climate. The town is visited by thousands of tourists annually from all over the world. Almora has beautifully been able to maintain its sanctity all over these years. There are total 11 Blocks (i.e. VikashKhand) in Almora district. Almora was founded in 1568 by King Kalyan Chand, however there are accounts of human settlements in the hills and surrounding region in the Hindu epic Mahabharata (8th and 9th century BCE). Almora was the seat of Chand kings that ruled over the Kumaon Kingdom. It is considered the cultural heart of the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. Etymology Almora got its name from Bhilmora, a kind of sorrel,(although some have tried to derive it from Berberis \\"kilmora\\") a short plant commonly found there which was used for washing the utensils of the sun temple at Katarmal. The people bringing the Bhilmora/kilmora were called Bhilmori/Kilmori and later \\"Almori\\" and the place came to be known as \\"Almora\\". When king Bhishm Chand laid the foundation of the town, he had initially named it Alamnagar. Prior to that, Almora was known as 'Rajapur' during the early phase of Chand rule. The name 'Rajpur' is also mentioned over a number of ancient copper plates. There is still a place called Rajpur in Almora. History Almora was founded in 1568 by Kalyan Chand during the rule of the Chand dynasty. Prior to that the region was under the control of Katyuri King Bhaichaldeo who donated a part of Almora to Sri Chand Tiwari. Almora in the 1860s According to local tradition, the earliest inhabitants in Almora were Tewaris who were required to supply Sorrel daily for cleansing the vessels of sun temple at Katarmal. Ancient lore mentioned in Vishnu Purana and Mahabharata present primordial accounts of human settlements in the City. The Sakas, the Nagas, the Kiratas, the Khasas and the Hunas are credited to be the most ancient tribes. The Kauravas and Pandavas of the Hastinapur royal family were the next important princes from the plains who are said to have affected the conquest of these parts. After the Mahabharata war the district seems to have remained for some time under the sway of the kings of Hastinapur whose authority was never more than nominal. The actual rulers were the local chiefs of whom the Kulindas (or Kunindas) were probably strong in the southern and western part of the city. The Khasas were another ancient people who belonged to an early Aryan stock and were widely scattered in those times. They gave this region the name Khasadesha or Khasamandala. Almora Bazaar, c1860 The next age's silent of them may probably be the ones signaling many petty states, rivaling each-other for supremacy and ultimately chartering the inauguration of the noted and enduring dynasty of Chands. Earlier to this, the Katyuris are recorded as the dominant clans in copper and stone engravings. The Chand dynasty from their inception in 953 A.D. to their ouster in the late 18th century present a saga of strife, with horrifying series of wars with rulers of Garhwal culminating in the destruction of this prosperous land and establishment of inglorious Gurkha rule. This dynasty was peculiar in that it made Almora the seat of strongest hill power in 1563 A.D. From that time onwards, the limits of kingdom of Kumaon extended over the entire tracts of districts of Almora and Nainital. Towards the end of the 17th century, Chand Rajas again attacked the Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688, king Udyot Chand erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwer and Parbateshwer, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti. The Parbateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple. Almora in the 1777 map of Delhi and Agra View of Almora, with soldiers of 3rd Gurkha Rifles, 1895. In 1791, the Gorkhas of Nepal while expanding their kingdom westwards across Kali River, invaded and overran Almora. In the meantime, the British were engaged in preventing the Gorkhas from over-running the whole of the northern frontier. The Gorkha rule lasted for twenty-four years. Due to their repeated intrusion into British territories in the Terai from 1800 onwards, Lord Moira, the Governor-General of India, decided to attack Almora in December 1814, marking the beginning of the Anglo-Gorkha war. The war that broke out in 1814, resulted in the defeat of the Gorkhas and subsequently led to the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816. According to the treaty, Nepal had to cede all those territories which the Gorkhas had annexed to the British East India Company. After the war, the old Lal Mandi fort, near Almora was renamed ‚ÄòFort Moira‚Äô. Unlike the neighboring hill stations like Nainital and Shimla which were developed by the British, Almora was developed much before by the Chand kings. The place where the present cantonment is located was formerly known as Lalmandi. Presently where the collectorate exists, the 'Malla Mahal' (Upper Court) of Chand kings was located. The site of present District Hospital used to be 'Talla Mahal' (Lower Court) of Chand rulers. Almora had a Population of 8596 in 1901.

There are Internet caf√©s in and around the city, but broadband connectivity is limited. Satellite dishes exist in most homes in the region and the channels available throughout India are also available here. Multiple local Hindi and English newspapers are published, whereas regional and national Hindi and English newspapers, printed elsewhere in India, are also circulated in Almora. a number of historical newspapers and magazines have been published from Almora like Prabuddha Bharata, Almora Akhbar, Shakti and Swadhin Praja etc. In 1871 A.D. Pt. Buddhiballav Pant opened a debating club. When Sir William Muir, the then provincial Governor, came here he was highly pleased with the working of this club. It is said that he also advised to open a press here and publish a newspaper. Mr. Pant, as advised, opened a press here and started publishing a weekly magazine Almora Akhbar. Almora Akhbar was the oldest Hindi weekly of this province. In 1913 A.D. Badri Datt Pandey took over the editing work of the magazine. Almora Akhbar made much progress; The number of its customers rose from 50-60 to 1500; however, it was closed in 1917. In 1918 one of the partners purchased the Debating Club Press and named it Vindhyavasini Press. From 1922 A.D. a weekly named Zila Samachar began to be published.

Being displeased at the policy of Shakti, some of his partners filed suits and withdrew their shares and in 1919 A.D. opened Sombari Press from which for some time a magazine named 'Jyoti' was published. Later on this press also was sold and the publication was stopped. Shakti continued published till 1942, when owing to policies of the government, its publication was stopped.

History  The Instituto Arquideocesano Ni√±os Cantores Del Zulia, a school that mainly offers music and religion lessons to children in the Zulia State, was created in the year 1974. Later, Gustavo Ocando Yamarte, creator of this institute, also would create the university \\"Cecilio Acosta\\" (UNICA). At around the same time, the regional television channel known as \\"Ni√±os Cantores Televisi√≥n, C.A\\", was created. This happened on January 31, 1987, after a long dispute with the government over the channel's concessions and installations. NCTV was the third television station to be created in the Zulia State after Televisoras del Zulia and Ondas del Lago Televisi√≥n. In its beginning, the members of the board of director of NCTV were Father Ocando Yamarte (president) and Dr. Elio Tulio √Ålvarez (general manager). This board remained in control until 1992, when professor Xiomara Villasmil was appointed the manager. She remained in her position until 1996. A couple of years later, NCTV changed their image and logo and converted into the corporation \\"Ni√±os Cantores Televisi√≥n, C.A\\". They also expanded their coverage to the Carabobo and Lara states. In 1996, E. P√©rez Lorito was named the station's general manager, staying in his position until October 3, 1997, when the Archdiocese of Maracaibo, as the channels main investor, decided to conduct an audit on the channels administration. Afterwards, the corporation was headed by the economist Alfredo Zambrano, who was appointed the chairman of the corporation. It was found during the audit that there was serious administrative disorder, which resulted in the reformation of NCTV, C.A, beginning in 1994 and continuing to this day. Later, in January 1998, the Archbishop of Maracaibo, Ram√≥n Ovidio P√©rez Morales, assumed the presidency of the corporation. He realized a press conference to publicly relieve their creditors any obligations of the corporation. National and regional television stations were present at this press conference. Paying off its debts was the beginning of the process of the administrative restructuring, not only for NCTV but for all of the companies that are owned by the corporation. A board of directors was installed. It included Ram√≥n Ovidio P√©rez (president), the economist Alfredo Zambrano (presidente of accounts), San J.

At the end of the administrative audit, the archdiocese of Maracaibo decided to create the position of Vicepresident of the corporation and hired a corporated team that was in charge of managing all of the companies owned by the Archdiocese of Maracaibo (La Emisora Radial, La Voz de la Fe, NC Stereo, C.A, Editora La Columna, and of course, NCTV). In July 1999, a second audit occurred. As a result the board of directors was removed and new executives were named to manage the station. Victor Carrillo is the station's current Director General.

What to Listen for in Music, . . \\"Did You Ever See a Lassie?\\" is a folk song, nursery rhyme, and singing game. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 5040. Lyrics Modern versions of the lyrics include: :Did you ever see a lassie, :A lassie, a lassie? :Did you ever see a lassie, :Go this way and that? :Go this way and that way, :Go this way and that way. :Did you ever see a lassie, :Go this way and that? :Did you ever see a laddie, :A laddie, a laddie? :Did you ever see a laddie, :Go this way and that? :Go this way and that way, :Go this way and that way. :Did you ever see a laddie, :Go this way and that? Origins The use of the terms \\"lassie\\" and \\"laddie\\" mean that this song is often attributed to possible origins in Scotland (by various forms of media; see \\"references\\" section), but it was first collected in the United States in the last decade of the nineteenth century and was not found in Great Britain until the mid-twentieth century. However, it can be surmised that the words to the song may have come from Scottish immigrants or Scottish-Americans because of the aforementioned terms. Along with \\"The More We Get Together\\", it is generally sung to the same tune as \\"Oh du lieber Augustin\\", a song written in Germany or Vienna in the late seventeenth century.J. J. Fuld, The Book of World-famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk (Dover, 5th edn., 2000), p. 399. It was first published in 1909, in Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gymnasium by Jessie Hubbell Bancroft. As a game The song is often accompanied by a circle singing game. Players form a circle and dance around one player. When they reach the end of the verse they stop, the single in the middle performs an action (such as Highland dancing), which everyone then imitates, before starting the verse again, often changing the single player to a boy, or a boy can join the center player - thus creating an extra verse in the song (\\"Did you ever see some children...\\").A. S. Fraserae, Ye min' langsyne?: A pot-pourri of games, rhymes, and ploys of Scottish childhood (London: Routledge, 1975), p. 23. References in popular culture and children's media The song is featured in the 1963 motion picture Ladybug, Ladybug. In the movie, children sing the song as part of a game while walking home from school during a nuclear bomb attack drill. The song, as sung by children, was used in a 1990 commercial for Maidenform, and played over a succession of pictures of women in uncomfortable-looking clothing, was followed by the tag-line, \\"Isn't it nice to live in a time when women aren't being pushed around so much anymore?\\" The song is featured in an episode of the Simpsons and was titled \\"Hail to the Bus Driver\\".

Designed by Rudolph Gehringer as a successor to the Pfalz D.III, the D.XII entered service in significant numbers near the end of the First World War. It was the last Pfalz aircraft to see widespread service. Though the D.XII was an effective fighter aircraft, it was overshadowed by the highly successful Fokker D.VII. Design and development Test pilot Otto August in an early Pfalz D.XII In early 1918, the Idflieg (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen) distributed to German aircraft manufacturers a detailed engineering report on the SPAD S.VII, whose wing structure Idflieg considered to be well-designed.Herris 2001, p. 87. Pfalz accordingly produced several Pfalz D.III-derived prototypes with SPAD-type wings. These developed into the Pfalz D.XII. The new aircraft was powered by the 180 hp Mercedes D.IIIa√º engine and continued the use of LFG-Roland's patented Wickelrumpf plywood- skinned monocoque fuselage construction.In Wickelrumpf construction, two layers of thin plywood strips were placed over a mold to form one half of a fuselage shell. The fuselage halves were then glued together, covered with a layer of fabric, and doped. LFG-Roland introduced the construction method in the Roland C.II, and licensed it for use in the Pfalz D.III. Unlike the earlier aircraft, the D.XII used a two-bay wing cellule. Furthermore, the flush wing radiator was replaced with a car-type radiator mounted in front of the engine.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 192. The prototype D.XII first flew in March 1918. Subsequently, Idflieg issued a production order for 50 aircraft. Pfalz entered several D.XII prototypes in the second fighter competition at Adlershof in May/June 1918. Only Ernst Udet and Hans Weiss favored the D.XII over the Fokker D.VII,Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 191. but Udet's opinion carried such weight that Pfalz received substantial production orders for the D.XII.Weyl 1965, p. 322. The aircraft passed its Typenpr√ºfung (official type test) on 19 June 1918. Difficulties with the radiator, which used vertical tubes rather than the more common honeycomb structure, delayed initial deliveries of the D.XII until June. The first 200 production examples could be distinguished by their rectangular fin and rudder. Subsequent aircraft featured a larger, rounded rudder profile. Operational use Captured Pfalz D.XII (serial 1970/18) in Canada after the war Pfalz D.XII (serial 1443/18) The D.XII began reaching the Jagdstaffeln, primarily Bavarian units, in July 1918. Most units operated the D.XII in conjunction with other fighter types, but units in quieter sectors of the front were completely equipped with the D.XII. While the D.XII was a marked improvement over the obsolescent Albatros D.Va and Pfalz D.IIIa, it nevertheless found little favor with German pilots, who strongly preferred the Fokker D.VII.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 88. Leutnant Rudolf Stark, commander of Jasta 35, wrote: Thanks to its sturdy wing and thin airfoil section, the D.XII maintained the excellent high-speed dive characteristics of the earlier Pfalz D.III. Like most contemporary fighters, however, the D.XII had an abrupt stall and a pronounced tendency to spin.Weyl 1965, p. 322. Furthermore, pilots consistently criticized the D.XII for its long takeoff run, heavy controls, and \\"clumsy\\" handling qualities in the air.Herris 2001, p. 101.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 85. Rate of roll, in particular, appears to have been deficient. Landings were difficult because the D.XII tended to float above the ground and the landing gear was weak. Ground crews disliked the extensive wire bracing of the two-bay wings, which required more maintenance than the Fokker D.VII's semi-cantilever wings. Evaluations of captured aircraft by Allied pilots were similarly unfavorable.Herris 2001, pp. 101‚Äì102. Between 750 and 800 D.XII scouts were completed by the Armistice. A substantial number, perhaps as many as 175, were surrendered to the Allies. Of these, a few were shipped to the United States and Canada for evaluation. Variants = Pfalz experimental D types = During the development of the D.XII, Pfalz produced several Pfalz D.III-derived prototypes with SPAD-type wings and Windhoff \\"ear\\" radiators.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 504. =Pfalz D.XIIf= The overcompressed BMW IIIa engine would have provided improved performance in the D.XIIf variant. Records show that Pfalz received 84 such engines between July and October 1918, but there is no photographic evidence of any production D.XII equipped with the BMW IIIa. In his autobiography, Anthony Fokker claimed that pilots deliberately wrecked D.XIIf aircraft so the engines could be salvaged and installed on Fokker D.VIIs. =Pfalz D.XIV= Pfalz D.XIV (serial 2800/18) The Pfalz D.XIV was a derivative of the D.XII, utilizing the same fuselage and basic wing structure. The D.XIV differed primarily by replacing the 180 hp Mercedes D.IIIa√º with the 200 hp Benz Bz.IV√º, a substantially heavier engine.Herris 2001, p. 104. To cope with the increased power and weight, the D.XIV featured longer span wings and an enlarged vertical stabilizer. Enlarged ailerons were used to maintain rate of roll. A few prototypes were tested at the second Adlershof competition and a small production order ensued. Production was quickly terminated, however, and the D.XIV did not see active service. The D.XIV did not offer an appreciable increase in performance over the D.XII, and the Benz Bz.IV√º engine was needed for reconnaissance aircraft.

The aircraft wears spurious markings from the movie The Dawn Patrol D.XII at the Australian War Memorial's ANZAC Hall. * In the 1920s, two D.XIIs were sold as war surplus to the Crawford Aeroplane & Supply Co. of Venice, California. Though badly deteriorated, the aircraft briefly appeared as props in the 1930 movie The Dawn Patrol.Wynne 1987, p. 97. Both D.XIIs were eventually sold to private collectors. Today, one of these aircraft is now displayed at the Seattle Museum of Flight, after it was acquired from the defunct Champlin Fighter Museum, in Mesa, Arizona.

Its service history is unknown. In late 1919, the aircraft was shipped from 2nd Aircraft Salvage Depot in France to England, and subsequently to Australia. It was temporarily exhibited in Melbourne and Adelaide in 1920. In 1924, the aircraft went on display in Sydney. :Serial 2600/18 was removed to storage in 2001.

History The company was founded in 1980 as MCA Videocassette, Inc., with the release of films on Beta and VHS, including Jaws, Jaws 2 and 1941. Prior to 1980, Castle Films (known as Universal 8 after 1977) had served as Universal's home film distribution unit. In late 1983, both the Laserdisc sister label MCA Videodisc and the VHS/Beta label MCA Videocassette were consolidated into a single entity, MCA Home Video, alternating with the MCA Videocassette name until December 1983. In 1990, with the 75th anniversary of Universal Studios, it became MCA/Universal Home Video, alternating with the MCA Home Video name from 1990 until 1997. The company later went by various company names, including Universal Studios Home Video (1997‚Äì2005) and Universal Studios Home Entertainment (2005‚Äì2016). In 1980, they released two '50s 3-D motion pictures, Creature from the Black Lagoon and It Came from Outer Space, in anaglyphic format on Beta and VHS. After the founding of NBC Universal in 2004, Universal started releasing DVDs of shows from the newly- established NBCUniversal Television Distribution. Universal 1440 Entertainment was formed in 2005 as the production arm of Universal Studios Home Entertainment. This company was the video distributor for DreamWorks titles until DreamWorks was sold to Paramount Pictures' parent company, Viacom, in 2006, at which point Paramount took over distribution. After Viacom spun off DreamWorks in 2008, Universal Studios Home Entertainment was planned to resume distributing DreamWorks' movies, but this deal fell through. The company was also the video distributor for Summit Entertainment releases until they were bought by Lionsgate. Until they formed their home video division, their releases were distributed by UPHE with the exception of Dogma, which was distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. In addition to DVDs, Universal was a major supporter of the HD DVD format until Toshiba discontinued the format. Since July 22, 2008, UPHE released Blu-rays and it was the last major Hollywood movie studio to do so. The first three Blu-ray releases to come out in the U.S. were The Mummy, its sequel and The Scorpion King. Since August 9, 2016, UPHE started releasing Ultra HD Blu-rays. UPHE is the U.S. home video distributor for the Universal Pictures film library, the Focus Features film library, and shows from NBCUniversal Television Distribution (NBC, E!, Syfy, USA Network, Universal Kids, and Oxygen). The division also currently has distribution deals with Bleecker Street, Mattel Creations, Aviron Pictures, Pure Flix Entertainment, Picturehouse, DreamWorks Pictures, GKIDS, Blumhouse Tilt, DreamWorks Classics (via DreamWorks Animation), Big Idea Entertainment, Neon, Entertainment One,https://deadline.com/2019/03/entertainment-one-eone-universal-pictures- home-entertainment-multi-territory-distribution-agreement-eddie-cunningham- steve-bertram-1202583216 and Amazon Studios (starting with Brad's Status) releases. On October 10, 2018, it was confirmed that UPHE would become MGM's home video distributor for films released by the United Artists Releasing joint venture, beginning with the Blu-ray release of Operation Finale on December 4, 2018; 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment continued to release MGM's April 1986-August 2018 catalog until June 30, 2020, when their deal expiredMGM & 20th Century Fox Renew Home Entertainment Deal, deadline.com, as well as Orion Pictures' releases starting with The Belko Experiment.

SPHE soon took over after the UPHE deal expired.http://www.onepiecepodcast.com/2017/07/31/sony-funimation- mean/#disqus_thread Starting on June 5, 2018, Universal re-released all of DreamWorks Animation's film library after their deal with 20th Century Fox ended. On January 14, 2020, Universal and Warner Home Video announced that they would partner on a 10-year multinational joint-venture, merging their physical operations in North America. Universal will distribute Warner Bros.' titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; while Warners will distribute Universal's titles in the U.K., Italy and Benelux. On April 7, 2020, the European Commission approved the merger.https://www.mediaplaynews.com/european-commission-approves-warner- universal-home-entertainment-joint-venture/ Internationally In the Netherlands, UPHE distributes most DVDs of films released theatrically by Independent Films, although this is now limited to catalog releases, as more recent films are now released through Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Belga Films. UPHE also distributes StudioCanal DVDs and Blu-rays in France, most of the Republic Pictures library in the UK and most of the Carolco Pictures library in Australia, Latin America, and several European countries (along with other StudioCanal properties). In the 1980s until the late 1990s, they also distributed tapes released by Cineplex Odeon in Canada. UPHE previously distributed its films on video internationally through CIC Video (a division of Cinema International Corporation, later United International Pictures) alongside Paramount Pictures. In Japan, releases from both Universal and Paramount appeared on CIC-Victor Video Ltd. (a joint venture between CIC Video and JVC) for VHS and on Pioneer LDC, Inc. for Laserdisc. Following Universal's acquisition of PolyGram in 1999, PolyGram Video (which had international operations) was dissolved into Universal.

The name of the joint venture is Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Australia. Before that, though, NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan had a marketing and distribution division in North America called Geneon USA, which, like UPHE, also distributed home video. At the time, NBCUEJ was known as Geneon Entertainment. Geneon USA shut down in late 2007, and Universal has licensed all of NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan's catalog to other companies rather than directly distributing them themselves. From 2017 to 2018, Funimation began directly distributing a select number of its titles in Australia and New Zealand through Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Australia. In September 2018, Funimation transferred distribution to Madman Entertainment, with Madman handling distribution and classification within the region. In October 2014, Universal established global headquarters for its home video division in Los Angeles. At the start of 2015, Paramount Home Media Distribution signed a distribution agreement with Universal, whereby the latter will distribute the former's titles overseas, particularly the territories where Paramount holds an office. The deal began on July 1, 2015 in the United Kingdom. Universal will continue distributing Paramount's DVDs and Blu-rays out of the United States and Canada. Alongside the announcement of the Universal/Warner Bros. NA physical home media joint-venture, Universal announced that they would begin handling home video distribution of Warner Bros. titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan in the third quarter of 2020, while Warner Bros. announced that they would begin handling home video distribution of Universal titles in the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in the first quarter of 2021.

Knudsen was best known as a drummer and vocalist for The Doobie Brothers. In addition, he founded the band Southern Pacific with fellow Doobie Brother John McFee. Biography Knudsen was born in Le Mars, Iowa. He began drumming while attending Princeton High School in Princeton, Illinois, where he graduated in 1966. After short stints playing in a club band and the Blind Joe Mendlebaum Blues Band, he became the drummer for organist/vocalist Lee Michaels. He played in The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils from late 1972 through mid 1973. He never did any formal studio recording with them, but recorded a live Texas Special on KSAN-FM in San Francisco with the Hoodoos and Johnny Winter. His big break came in 1974 when he was invited to join The Doobie Brothers, replacing the departing Michael Hossack. Knudsen joined the band during the recording of the 1974 Top 10 platinum album, What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. He made his recording debut with the Doobies on What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits in 1974, performing backing vocals over instrumental tracks that included Hossack. Knudsen did not get behind the drum kit in the recording studio until Stampede in 1975. Knudsen was co-drummer with John Hartman and later Chet McCracken until the Doobies disbanded in 1982. His contribution to the group's vocal harmonies in the studio and in concert was as crucial as his drumming. After the Doobies disbanded in 1982, Knudsen and fellow Doobie John McFee formed the country rock band Southern Pacific. The group was successful in the country charts but disbanded in the early 1990s. By then the two men had formed a writing partnership and despite not rejoining the group at that time, co-wrote the song Time Is Here And Gone with Doobies' percussionist Bobby LaKind, featured on the Doobies reunion album Cycles in 1989. Knudsen organized a one-off Doobies reunion in 1987 to raise funds for the National Veterans Foundation. After Southern Pacific folded, both he and McFee rejoined the Doobie Brothers on a full-time basis in 1993. Ironically, Knudsen found himself drumming alongside Michael Hossack, whom he had replaced all those years ago. Of the multiple pairings of Doobie Brothers drummers over the decades, Knudsen's time-keeping partnership with Hossack lasted the longest. He featured prominently as a songwriter on the album Sibling Rivalry (2000), which was, at the time, only the band's third studio album since reuniting. He also featured on the albums Rockin' Down the Highway: The Wildlife Concert (1996), and Live at Wolf Trap (2004). In 2005 he played drums on Emmylou Harris Shores Of White Sand off the All I Intend To Be record. Though Knudsen was a frequent backing vocalist for the Doobie Brothers, he did not sing lead on many released Doobies tracks. On \\"Double Dealin' Four Flusher\\" (from Stampede) he is heard trading brief lead vocal lines with Pat Simmons and Tom Johnston. (The box set Long Train Runnin': 1970‚Äì2000 has an early rehearsal version of this song, called \\"Shuffle,\\" with vocals only by Simmons and Knudsen.) Knudsen can also be heard singing lead on songs from the 1982 Doobie Brothers Farewell Tour (\\"Don't Start Me To Talkin'\\" from Farewell Tour; \\"Listen To The Music\\" from the Farewell Tour video and the album Live at the Greek Theater 1982). Sibling Rivalry features two later, and very different sounding, Knudsen lead vocals. Knudsen died of pneumonia in Kentfield, California, at the age of 56. He was living in Northern California with his wife, Kate, and his daughter Dayna at the time of his death.

A paver (paver finisher, asphalt finisher, paving machine) is a piece of construction equipment used to lay asphalt on roads, bridges, parking lots and other such places. It lays the asphalt flat and provides minor compaction before it is compacted by a roller. History The asphalt paver was developed by Barber Greene Co., that originally manufactured material handling systems. In 1929 the Chicago Testing Laboratory approached them to use their material loaders to construct asphalt roads. This did not result in a partnership but Barber Greene did develop a machine based on the concrete pavers of the day that mixed and placed the concrete in a single process. This setup did not prove as effective as desired and the processes were separated and the modern paver was on its way. In 1933 the independent float screed was invented and when combined with the tamper bar provided for uniform material density and thickness. Harry Barber filed for a patent a \\"Machine for and process of laying roads\\" on 10 April 1936 and received patent on 6 December 1938. The main features of the paver developed by Barber Greene Co. have been incorporated into most pavers since, although improvements have been made to control of the machine. Operation The asphalt is added from a dump truck or a material transfer unit into the paver's hopper. The conveyor then carries the asphalt from the hopper to the auger. The auger places a stockpile of material in front of the screed. The screed takes the stockpile of material and spreads it over the width of the road and provides initial compaction. The paver should provide a smooth uniform surface behind the screed. In order to provide a smooth surface a free floating screed is used. It is towed at the end of a long arm which reduces the base topology effect on the final surface. The height of the screed is controlled by a number of factors including the attack angle of the screed, weight and vibration of the screed, the material head and the towing force. To conform to the elevation changes for the final grade of the road modern pavers use automatic screed controls, which generally control the screed's angle of attack from information gathered from a grade sensor. Additional controls are used to correct the slope, crown or superelevation of the finished pavement. In order to provide a smooth surface the paver should proceed at a constant speed and have a consistent stockpile of material in front of the screed. Increase in material stockpile or paver speed will cause the screed to rise resulting in more asphalt being placed therefore a thicker mat of asphalt and an uneven final surface. Alternatively a decrease in material or a drop in speed will cause the screed to fall and the mat to be thinner. The need for constant speed and material supply is one of the reasons for using a material transfer unit in combination with a paver. A material transfer unit allows for constant material feed to the paver without contact, providing a better end surface. When a dump truck is used to fill the hopper of the paver, it can make contact with the paver or cause it to change speed and affect the screed height. Concrete paving Large freeways are often paved with concrete and this is done using a slipform paver. Trucks dump loads of readymix concrete in heaps along in front of this machine and then the slipform paver spreads the concrete out and levels it off using a screed.

He was the husband of late singer Anna Jantar and the father of singer Natalia Kukulska. Early life Kukulski was born on May 25, 1944 in Wrze≈õnia to Maria and Kazimierz Kukulski. In 1967, Kukulski graduated from Pozna≈Ñ Secondary Music School and the Instrumental Department of the State Higher School of Music in Pozna≈Ñ, where he learned to play the oboe. At the same time he completed an internship in Pozna≈Ñska Opera and the Philharmonic in Zielona G√≥ra. He collaborated with a cabaret ‚ÄùNurt‚Äù in Pozna≈Ñ. Career Plaque commemorating Anna Jantar and Jaros≈Çaw Kukulski at their former apartment in Warsaw For a time, he played jazz in dixieland bands. In 1968, at the II Military Song Festival in Ko≈Çobrzeg, he received an award from the Ministry of National Defense for the song Za≈õlubinowy pier≈õcie≈Ñ ('The Wedding Ring'). In 1968, he started a big-beat band named Waganci. In 1969, his future wife Anna Jantar joined the band as a soloist. As a result of frequent personnel changes, Kukulski disbanded the group in 1972 in order to focus on his wife's solo career. In the 1970s, he was responsible for most of Anna Jantar's greatest successes and wrote for her notable hits such as, Najtrudniejszy pierwszy krok ('The Most Difficult First Step'), Tyle s≈Ço≈Ñca w ca≈Çym mie≈õcie ('So Much Sun in the Whole City') and Moje jedyne marzenie ('My Only Dream'). After Anna Jantar's death on 1980, he continued to compose songs for his daughter Natalia and many other famous Polish artists such as Irena Jarocka, Eleni Tzoka, Krzysztof Krawczyk, Anna German, Felicjan Andrzejczak, Bogus≈Çaw Mec and his second wife Monika Borys. He also collaborated other well-known Polish songwriters. Kukulski served on the jury of the Soviet Song Festival in Zielona G√≥ra. He served as composer from Polish films Nie zaznasz spokoju (1977), Komedianci z wczorajszej ulicy (1986) and Pan Samochodzik i niesamowity dw√≥r (1987). At the end of the 1990s, TVP Polonia broadcast a regular program devoted to the work of outstanding Polish artists, mainly composers and authors of texts entitled \\"Z archiwum i pamiƒôci\\" ('From the Archive and Memory'). Three episodes of this program were devoted to Kukulski. Personal life Natalia Kukulska In 1969, Kukulski met Anna Jantar, during the creation of his band Waganci. On August 15, 1970, they had a civil wedding at the Pozna≈Ñ Town Hall and later a church wedding on April 11, 1971, at the Church of St. Anna in Pozna≈Ñ. The couple had one daughter, Natalia Kukulska (born on March 3, 1976). On March 14, 1980, Anna Jantar died in the crash of LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007 near Okƒôcie Airport in Warsaw, while returning from the United States after performing in concerts for the Polish American communities. Kukulski later married singer Monika Borys. In 1989, the couple had a son named Piotr Kukulski. Final years and death On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of his composing work in 2005, the album Moje Piosenki with his greatest hits was released.

Brant, Degonwadonti, or Kaieneke'hak was a Mohawk writer, essayist, and poet of the Bay of Quinte Mohawk from the Tyendinaga Mohawk Reserve in Ontario, Canada. She is also a lecturer, editor, and speaker. She wrote based on her deep connection to her indigenous people and touched on the infliction of racism and colonization. She brought her writing to life from her personal experiences of being a lesbian, having an abusive spouse, and her mixed blood heritage from having a Mohawk father and a Scottish-Irish mother. She has three books of essays and short stories and three edited anthologies published. Life She was born in Detroit, Michigan on May 6, 1941. Brant grew up off the reservation; however, she maintained a deep link to her Tyendinaga Mohawk heritage with her paternal grandparents where she learned the culture, language, and traditional stories. She was descended from a family of tribal leaders Molly Brant and Chief Joseph Brant from the Tyendinaga Mohawk tribe. Her paternal grandparents moved to the Detroit area with the hope their nine children would have more opportunities away from the reservation. Her parents, Joseph and Hazel Brant, and her brother and sister, grew up in her paternal grandparent's Detroit home. Her father worked in an automobile factory, and later as a teacher. She married her husband and became pregnant at the age of 17. She went on to have three children named Kim, Jill, and Jennifer. After leaving her fourteen-year abusive marriage in 1973, Brant became active in the feminist community and announced her sexual orientation as a lesbian. She met her partner, Denise Dorsz, in 1976. They equally divided their time between living in Michigan and Ontario. In the initial years following her divorce, Brant worked any unskilled job she could to support her three children, including working as a salesclerk, waitress, and cleaner. Her writing came later in her life at the age of forty when she had a monumental experience on a trip through the Mohawk reservation with Dorsz. An eagle flew in front of their car window while she was driving. The eagle landed on a nearby tree and Brant stopped the car to bear witness at the creature. They looked at one another and the nonverbal communication spoke to Brant. The eagle told her to start writing and thus her writing career began. She displayed writing ranges of humorous to aggressive and intense to spiritual writing. Her later years were spent as a grandmother and great-grandmother to three grandsons Nathaneal, Benjamin, and Zachary, a granddaughter, Olivia, as well as two great-grandchildren, Hazel and Luke. She died on August 6, 2015. Career Beth Brant was born to write and was almost immediately recognized for her talents. She was published the first year she began officially writing. She was recognized by 1983 editors Adrienne Rich and Michelle Cliff from the lesbian periodical Sinister Wisdom who asked Brant to edit a collection of Native American woman's writing. This developed into A Gathering of Spirit (1988) where it, at first, was published in 1984 in Sinister Wisdom and then was reissued as a book many times. It was the first anthology of Native American's women writing edited by another Native American woman. Her success continued with publication of Mohawk Trail in 1985. This is a collection of short stories, poems, and creative nonfiction. Then, she continued the momentum in 1991 with Food and Spirits. Her fiction embraces the themes of racism, colonialism, abuse, love, community, and what it means to be Native. Writing as Witness: Essays and Talk, Brant's volume of essays, was published in 1994. The essays covered a range of subjects regarding the writer's craft and its meaning. In 2003, Brant continued with her second collection of essays called Testimony from the Faithful. Brant embraced her connection with her Native Mohawk people while working on Testimony from the Faithful, and pursued her oral history as well. She edited a series of autobiographical stories told by the Elders of the Tyendinaga Mohawk territory. This was called I'll Sing 'Till the Day I Die: Conversations with Tyendinaga Elders and was published in 1995. The project preserved the knowledge and wisdom through their stories. This made a scholarly contribution to the continued growing of Aboriginal oral history. A year after, Brant and Sandra Laronde published a co-edited issue of the annual journal Native Women in the Arts, called Sweetgrass Grows All Around Her. Brant's writing continued to be published in anthologies and periodicals, particularly focused on Native, feminist, and lesbian perspectives. Activism & Mentorship Brant played a pivotal role as one of the first lesbian-identifying Native American writers in North America. Her work represents both her Native and lesbian sides. She also put value in being a mother and grandmother. She had few role models when she began her writing career and encouraged Native American women writers who succeeded her. Teaching and mentoring was significant role in Brant's life. Her work took her to university classes to provide conversation on topics such as colonialism, racism, sexism, homophobia, and the survival of Aboriginal peoples. She lectured at the University of British Columbia in 1989 and 1990 and guest lectured for classes in women's studies and Native American studies at the New College of the University of Toronto. Also, Brant lectured and read at universities and culture centres across North America. Brant contributed to a number of creative writing workshops, including the Women of Colour Writing Workshop held in Vancouver in 1991, the 1991 Michigan Festival of Writers in East Lansing, the International Feminist Book Fair held in Amsterdam in 1992, and the Flight of the Mind Writing Workshop in Eugene, Oregon in 1992. In addition, she formed creative writing workshops and groups for Native American women, women in prison, and high school students. She has always looked for ways to help others express themselves. Brant participated in a project called Returning the Gift, which was designed to create new opportunities for Native writers to share their work. It included a 1992 meeting of 250 writers in Norman, Oklahoma, including various outreach programs and the formation of an organization called the Native Writers' Circle of the Americas. Brant continued her efforts on other projects as well. In 1982, she confounded Turtle Grandmother, a clearinghouse for manuscripts by Native American women and a source of information about Native women. It lasted until 1987. She was also an AIDS activist, working with People with AIDS (PWA) and giving AIDS education workshops throughout Native communities.

In sports, it can be applied to teams, and individuals. In sports where teams or individuals represent groups such as countries or regions, those groups can also be said to have 'winning streaks' if their representatives win consecutive games or competitions, even if the competitors are different. Streaks can also be applied to specific competitions: for example a competitor who wins an event in three consecutive Olympic Games has an Olympic winning streak, even if they have lost other competitions during the period.

The primary schedule overhaul eliminated midweek races, thus cutting the schedule from 48 to around 30 races (36 currently), and a minimum race distance (first , later shortened to ). Since many pre-1972 races were under 100 miles (such as 62.5 mile races held in Islip, New York, and the current non-championship Budweiser Duel then being a championship race at 100 miles until 1967), some NASCAR records are differentiated that way, similar to the NBA differentiating \\"fewest points\\" records with pre and post-1954 records, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced. ;Post‚Äì1972 4 wins (tie) (length of shortest race, in miles, in brackets): * 1976 Cale Yarborough (216.8) * 1981 Darrell Waltrip (250) * 1987 Dale Earnhardt (250) * 1991 Harry Gant (250) * 1992 Bill Elliott (300) * 1993 Mark Martin (220.5) * 1998 Jeff Gordon (220.5) * 2007 Jimmie Johnson (263) Note: In seven of the eight instances, at least one of the wins was in a 500-mile race.

Coached by Peter Ross, Australian Baseball Hall of Fame (ABHoF). Star Players were Russell Freeman and Preston Davis both of whom are in the ABHoF. Davis was also a heroic American soldier who served in four wars. He hit the final home run of his career in his final at bat. The day after winning his final championship he boarded a 747 and returned to America. He never played again. In seven years in Australia he never missed a game, hit .545 and was clutch when his team needed him the most. He often got the big hit when his team was down, he was an RBI machine. He will forever be known as Mr Baseball in Australia. Davis attributed his success to always going to the batting cages every single day and hitting 100 pitches. =World Baseball Classic= 2 consecutive titles ‚Äì Japan =World Cup= 9 consecutive titles ‚Äì Cuba * Streak started 1984 Havana, Cuba * Streak ended 2007 Taipei, Taiwan Major League Baseball =By a team= 26 games ‚Äì New York Giants * Streak started September 7, 1916 (defeated Brooklyn Dodgers, 4‚Äì1) * Streak ended September 30, 1916 (defeated by Boston Braves, 3‚Äì8) Note: The Giants tied the Pirates in the second game of a doubleheader 1‚Äì1 on September 18, 1916.

Currently, there are four routes in service with separate schedules. Most make no stops in between LAX and their terminal station. At the airport, the buses are distinguished by their light blue color and large FlyAway logo appliques. Buses pick up travelers at every terminal on the arrival level under green signs reading FlyAway, Buses and Long-Distance Vans. When dropping off passengers, the bus stops at each airport terminal on the departure level. The Van Nuys and Union Station routes use larger motorcoach buses, while the Hollywood and Long Beach routes use smaller cutaway shuttle buses or low-floor transit-style buses. As well as using the blue FlyAway branded buses, sometimes FlyAway Bus routes use buses from the fleet of its operators which do not have the same blue livery. The FlyAway bus network is owned by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which also owns and operates LAX and Van Nuys Airport. FlyAway is part of the LAWA ground transportation initiative to improve passenger convenience, reduce traffic congestion and vehicle emissions pollutants by encouraging high-occupancy vehicle ridership as part of the LAX Master Plan Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program. LAWA reported the FlyAway network serviced more than 1.5 million passengers in 2008, allowing its passengers to avoid driving a combined total of 23 million vehicle miles and saving nearly of gasoline. Routes Panorama of the Van Nuys Flyaway bus station =Van Nuys= This route travels between LAX and the FlyAway terminal building and parking structure located near the LAWA-owned Van Nuys Airport. The Van Nuys FlyAway route provides services 24 hours a day, with buses departing every half-hour throughout much of the day (except every 15 minutes during peak hours and every hour late in the night). Van Nuys is the only FlyAway location with a passenger terminal building (located at 7610 Woodley Ave), which opened on December 17, 2004. The US$34-million facility was designed to serve as a remote LAX terminal, and was designed with the ability to add airline ticketing and checked baggage services in the future. The renovation also added a 2,000-car parking structure, more convenient passenger drop-off and new landscaping. The service is operated with 45-foot motorcoaches. The Van Nuys FlyAway is the original route and was the only FlyAway service for more than 30 years after it was launched on July 10, 1975. During its first year of operation it transported over 275,000 passengers. By 2008, Los Angeles World Airports reported the annual passenger count from its flagship location in the San Fernando Valley rose to nearly 988,000. The Van Nuys FlyAway route is one of the few public transportation systems that operates at a profit. Fares and parking fees charged to customers generates enough revenue that LAWA expects to have a net operating profit of approximately $168,000 in 2013. =Union Station= FlyAway bus at Union Station This route travels between LAX and Los Angeles Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. It is mainly intended for those who use public transportation to get to Union Station and then transfer to the bus to complete their journey. There is, however, a parking garage available for those who wish to drive to Union Station, though the rates are higher than at Van Nuys. The Union Station FlyAway route operates 24 hours a day, with buses departing every half-hour throughout much of the day (except every 20 minutes during peak hours and every hour late in the night). The buses leave from Bay 1 at Union Station's Patsaouras Transit Plaza, and use the high- occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on the Harbor Freeway (I-110) and the carpool/high- occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on the Century Freeway (I-105). Tickets may be purchased from the staffed FlyAway kiosk at the Patsaouras Transit Plaza or at any Metrolink ticket vending machine. The buses on this route look very similar to the Van Nuys buses, but bus drivers remind riders which bus goes to which destination and destination signs are present on the front and sides of each bus. The LAX FlyAway began offering service at Union Station on March 15, 2006 and has been hailed as a success by city officials since its inception. Union Station was the second FlyAway service location to open. During its first year of operation the FlyAway at Union Station transported 250,000 passengers, more than three times the number predicted at the onset of service. By 2008, Los Angeles World Airports reported the annual passenger count rose to more than 433,000. =Hollywood= This route travels between LAX and a stop located on Vine Street, just southwest of the Hollywood/Vine station on the Metro B Line. The Hollywood FlyAway route runs once an hour between 5:15 am and 9:15 pm southbound and 6:15 am and 10:15 pm northbound with buses departing Hollywood and LAX at 15 minutes past the hour. Service on the Hollywood FlyAway route began on September 3, 2014. There is no dedicated long-term FlyAway parking at the Hollywood/Vine station, although public pay parking is available nearby. The Hollywood FlyAway route is intended for those who live in Hollywood, those using the Metro B Line, or those being picked up or dropped off by a motorist at nearby metered parking or paid parking facilities. Since its inception, over 75 complaints about the Hollywood FlyAway have been logged, ranging from buses arriving up to an hour late to not arriving at all. In December 2014, LAWA informed Corinthian Transportation, the contractor that supplies the service, that they expect greatly improved service immediately; however, the organization did not specify what punitive measures would be taken in the event service did not improve. Corinthian offered a plan in January 2015 to LAWA to improve the service, but it was rejected as inadequate. Corinthian claims that they have increased the number of buses on the Hollywood route, but as of January 2015 the problems persisted. = Long Beach = Long Beach FlyAway Bus at Long Beach Transit Shelter A This route travels between LAX and Shelter A at the Long Beach Transit Gallery in downtown Long Beach. The stop is near the Downtown Long Beach station on the Metro A Line and dozens of Long Beach Transit bus routes stop nearby.

Service on the Long Beach FlyAway route began on December 30, 2015. There is no dedicated long-term FlyAway parking in Long Beach, although public pay parking is available nearby. The route is intended for those who live in Long Beach, those using transit, and those being picked up or dropped off nearby. Fares LAX FlyAway buses do not accept cash. Tickets may be purchased onboard or online. Fares may also be paid with an LA Metro TAP Card. Tickets for the Union Station route can also be purchased at a Metrolink ticket vending machine located at all train stations, including Union Station. Metrolink monthly pass holders can ride the Union Station route for free with a same-day plane ticket.  Former routes  = Irvine = Irvine Transportation Center The LAX FlyAway from Irvine operated from the Irvine Transportation Center. Service commenced on November 16, 2009 providing for a 60-minute or more journey between LAX and the Irvine Transportation Center. Following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Coach America, the operator of the route, service was terminated on August 31, 2012. The Irvine Transportation Center provided access to Metrolink and Amtrak services and provided more convenient access to Central and Southern Orange County. The LAX FlyAway station was next to the tracks near the shuttle pick up and drop-off area. LAX FlyAway passengers had access to free long term overnight parking (500 spaces) in a lot next to the Irvine Transportation Center. Unlike the frequent services of the other FlyAway routes, the Irvine route only ran six times a day, with buses two to four hours apart. The fare was also much higher at $25 for adults. =Expo/La Brea= This route traveled from the Expo/La Brea station on the Metro Expo Line to LAX. Service on the Expo/La Brea FlyAway route began on July 1, 2013 and offered bi-hourly service priced lower than other routes. The route was discontinued on September 2, 2014 due to very low ridership. =Santa Monica= This route traveled between LAX and Santa Monica Place (2nd Street & Colorado Avenue). The route ran once an hour between 5:45 am and 9:45 pm southbound and 6:45 am and 11:45 pm northbound with buses departing Santa Monica Place and LAX at 45 minutes past the hour. Service on the Santa Monica FlyAway route began on July 15, 2014. There is no dedicated long-term FlyAway parking at the Santa Monica Place, although public pay parking is available nearby. The Santa Monica FlyAway route was intended for those who live in Santa Monica, those using the city's Big Blue Bus system, the nearby Metro Expo Line, and those being picked up or dropped off nearby. This service was discontinued as of 11:59pm, Monday September 5, 2016. =Orange Line= Starting on December 7, 2015, some trips on the Van Nuys FlyAway made an additional stop at the Woodley station on the Metro Orange Line. The stop allowed San Fernando Valley residents to reach LAX without having to drive to the airport or to the existing Van Nuys terminal building. Hourly service was offered at this stop between 4 am and 11 pm each day. Buses stopped at a dedicated bus bay on the south side of Victory Boulevard just east of Woodley Avenue. No parking was available. Due to low ridership, the Orange Line FlyAway stop was discontinued on January 31, 2019. =Westwood= Westwood FlyAway bus stopped at UCLA Parking Structure 32. This route traveled between LAX and Parking Structure 32 south of the UCLA campus in Westwood. The Westwood FlyAway route ran once an hour between 6 am and 10 pm southbound and 6 am and 11 pm northbound with buses departing UCLA and LAX at the top of every hour. Drivers dropping off or picking up FlyAway passengers could enter and exit UCLA's Parking Structure 32 without paying a fee. Limited parking was also available (25 stalls in the structure are marked for the use of FlyAway passengers) for $12 per weekday, $8 per weekend day and $63 for any 7-day period. The LAX FlyAway in Westwood began operating on June 14, 2007. The Westwood location was the third FlyAway route in the network of non-stop buses to LAX. The Westwood route converted to smaller clean-fueled, compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in fall 2008. The buses mostly traveled on the congested Interstate 405 Freeway, so average travel time could have been 45 minutes or longer during peak traffic hours. During its first year of operation the FlyAway at Westwood transported 105,300 passengers, nearly 10 percent more than the number predicted at the onset of service. The 2008 annual passenger count reported by Los Angeles World Airports was nearly 125,300. The Westwood Flyaway route was discontinued on July 1, 2019.

Life Maurice Frank Kenny was born on August 16, 1929 in Watertown, New York. His father was of Mohawk and Irish heritage,Motyka, John (April 26, 2016). \\"Maurice Kenny, Who Explored His Mohawk Heritage in Poetry, Dies at 86.\\" New York Times. Retrieved 2016-05-03. from Canada, and his mother, who was born in Upstate New York, was part English and part Seneca. The family, which also included two older sisters, lived in Watertown and Kenny spend his school years there and his summers on his relatives' farm in nearby Cape Vincent until his parents separated when he was \\"eleven or twelve\\".\\"Introduction: A Memoir\\" in On Second Thought: A Compilation (Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1995) His mother moved to Bayonne, New Jersey and his father remained in Watertown, with young Maurice remaining predominantly in his father's custody for most of his adolescence. He briefly stayed with friends of his mother's in Syracuse, New York before running away, after which he moved to his mother's residence in Bayonne when he was sixteen. Rather than attending school there, Kenny skipped classes regularly, preferring to go into Manhattan and seek autographs from stars of film and theatre outside hotels. After several months of this, Kenny was brought before a juvenile judge for truancy and had to be returned to his father's custody and to Watertown, where he completed his high school years. After graduation, Kenny spent a summer with a traveling theatre troupe in Alexandria Bay, New York. Thereafter, he spent a year in New York trying to break into the theatre as an actor, but returned to Watertown after a year. He spent four years studying at Butler University under such esteemed instructors as Werner Beyer and Roy Marz, graduating in 1956 with a degree in English. Kenny once again returned to Watertown briefly after graduating, taking classes with Douglas Angus at nearby St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. He left again for Manhattan in 1957, intending to enroll at Columbia University, but instead became the manager of a branch of Marboro Books, a position that put him in contact with all manner of literary, cinematic, and theatrical figures. He also began taking courses at New York University, where he met poet and critic Louise Bogan, the greatest influence on his early development as a writer. During the early 1960s, Kenny moved to Mexico, where he worked as a secretary for the novelist Willard Motley. In 1964, he moved to the United States Virgin Islands, and then in 1966 to Chicago, where he wrote obituaries for the Chicago Sun-Times, before returning to New York in 1967 and settling in Brooklyn, which was his home until 1984. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Kenny was increasingly active in Native American activism, having undergone an awakening to the extent and significance of his own Mohawk identity in the wake of the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969. He was prevented from being at Wounded Knee in 1973 because of health issues, but wrote a poem entitled \\"I Am the Sun\\" that adapted a traditional Lakota chant into a statement of solidarity with the protesters and activists. Having not published extensively since the early 1960s, Kenny embarked on the most productive period of his life in the late 1970s, producing more than twenty books of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction over the next two decades, as well as co-editing the journal Contact/II with Josh Gosciak and running the independent Strawberry Press, which published predominantly Native authors. After 1984, Kenny divided his time primarily between the upstate New York towns of Saranac Lake, and Potsdam. He taught at North Country Community College, Paul Smith's College, and SUNY Potsdam and retired from his teaching duties at the latter in 2011. He lived the final years of his life in Saranac Lake, where he died on April 16, 2016. At the time of his death, he was working on six separate book manuscripts, including an autobiography and several collections of poetry on topics ranging from Frida Kahlo to the Dutch settlement of the Hudson Valley during the 1600s. Education Kenny was educated at Butler University, St. Lawrence University and New York University, where he studied with American poet Louise Bogan. Career Kenny was co-editor with Josh Gosciak of Contact/II, a literary magazine and occasional poetry press that was active between 1976 and 1993. Kenny was also the editor and publisher of Strawberry Press (most active in the 1970s and 1980s) and Many Moons Press (most active in the 2000s and 2010s). Strawberry Press published poems and artwork, often in postcard form, by Native Americans. Many Moons Press published poetry and artwork primarily from writers and artists associated with the North Country of New York State, including photographer Mark Kurtz and poets Dan Bodah and Ethan Shantie. Kenny read his poetry throughout the United States and Europe, including in Germany, the Czech Republic, Belgium, France, and Austria during two visits to the continent in 2011 and 2012. Notable New York City readings included the Poetry Festival at St. Clement's Church, West 46th Street, Manhattan; Waterways: Poetry in the Mainstream readings and book fairs; the American Indian Community House; Poets House; and many other venues. Kenny held residencies at a number of colleges and universities, including St. Lawrence University (which granted him an honorary doctorate in 1995), the American Indian Community House in New York City, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, the University of California, Berkeley, the En'owkin Center, the University of Oklahoma, and Syracuse Community Writers (funded by the New York State Council on the Arts).

It involves purchasing landing rights for cities around the globe. In 1993, an enhanced version was released for the Amiga as Air Bucks v1.2. Gameplay The game begins in 1946, after the Second World War. Using default settings, the player controls the airline \\"Air Bucks\\" with three AI competitors; all are based in the city of Miami. Each player purchases landing rights for a surrounding airport not more than 1,000 miles away, as the only plane available at the beginning (the Douglas DC-3) has a range of 1,000 miles. Usually the first landing rights purchased are in either New York or Washington D.C. Aside from the initial base airport (Miami by default, but customizable) only two airlines can have landing rights to any one airport. While waiting for landing rights to be awarded, which takes one month at the beginning of the game and two to three months later on, the player can acquire airplanes and adjust each plane's LOPA (layout of passenger accommodations) by altering the number of first class and coach seats. Once landing rights are established the player creates a route between two or more cities, sets coach and first class ticket prices, and then assigns planes to the route. The ticket price and service amenities can be constantly adjusted until optimum revenue is generated. As time progresses, new models of airplanes become available for purchase, such as the Douglas DC-6, Boeing 747, and the A√©rospatiale Concorde. The game's demand model calculates passenger demand for each route based on ticket pricing, plane speed, size of destinations, plane age, service quality (a function of employee wages), advertising spend, aircraft reliability (a function of maintenance spend) and other factors. The game also simulates fuel price fluctuations based on historical inflation data, and periodically generates weather events and strikes which temporarily close particular airports. The default computer companies are \\"Transglobal Inc\\", \\"International GT\\", and \\"Great Times\\". The number and selection of computer and human players is customizable, as are the company names and logos, starting site, and difficulty. Reception Computer Gaming World gave Air Bucks a negative review. The magazine criticized the interface, version 1.0's slow game speed, and poor computer AI and economic model, and concluded \\"Right now, my feeling is that this flight has been delayed\\". In 1993 Impressions released version 1.2, advertising that it was a \\"New Air Bucks!\\" with \\"the features you want\\", including better VGA graphics, interface, computer AI, and economic model. The company (\\"Committed to customer satisfaction\\") offered the upgrade for free to registered owners of the game. Cities in Air Bucks Air Bucks represents 128 airport sites: 6 in Australia; 2 in New Zealand; 8 in the South Pacific; 25 in Asia; 7 in Africa; 33 in Europe; 1 in Greenland; 1 in Bermuda; 14 in Latin America; 5 in Canada; and 26 in the United States. While the game includes a number of small historical \\"technical stop\\" destinations such as Wake Island, Canton Island, Gander, the Azores, Shannon and Recife, some major cities such as Dubai, Casablanca, Tel Aviv and Brisbane are absent. There are also some minor spelling and geographical errors in the game; for example, sites include both \\"Fiji\\" (which appears to be closer to Noum√©a, New Caledonia on the map) and \\"Nandi\\" (Nadi International Airport is actually the main airport on the main island of Fiji). Since no more than two airlines can acquire landing rights to any one airport, competition is keen for large- market airports and, early in the game before airplanes have trans-oceanic range, for tech-stop airports.

Pre-naval service She was built as CGS Cartier for service as a hydrographic survey ship by Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson, at Newcastle upon Tyne, between 1908 and 1910. She saw many duties as a ship belonging to the Dominion government. She was utilized by Canada, France, the United States and England while under the Dominion Flag on the East Coast of Canada, and throughout the Atlantic, charting and taking soundings. Cartier was used to chart some of the most dangerous coastal waters into Iceland and the Dominion of Newfoundland. She was also contracted to assist in Marine insurance Investigations. World War I  During World War I, CGS Cartier supported the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and was converted to an armed patrol and training vessel for junior officers. However, she was not commissioned into the RCN, and maintained her civilian name as she remained a Dominion asset. The Dominion Government was responsible for her upkeep, as well as arming and manning her. The RCN provided the personnel, however the Dominion government paid them separately from the naval service's budget. Inter-war service CGS Cartier returned to her former service as a hydrographic survey vessel which included work on the Atlantic coast. Her ability to chart exact locations was used extensively to curb smuggling operations and Dominion law enforcement used her as a platform for anti-smuggling operations, resulting in timely searches of suspected smugglers. Notwithstanding this role, she was forever a survey vessel first and foremost. World War II During World War II, CGS Cartier was formally commissioned into the RCN on 18 September 1939, becoming HMCS Cartier. HMCS Cartier became a training ship and then an armed coastal patrol ship before returning to training duties. As a training ship, her hydrographic survey instrumentation saw use in educating officers and crew for Advanced Navigation and Naval Mine Avoidance Navigation. On 9 December 1941, HMCS Cartier was renamed HMCS Charny, likely to avoid confusion with the French-language naval reserve unit in Montreal, NCSM Cartier. By special dispensation of the Dominion Government, she was given the rare honour of being allowed to continue to fly her commissioning pennant that she received as HMCS Cartier. From this time on, Charny was used as a training vessel and research vessel. She received two Mentioned in Despatches (MID), and was entitled to paint two Oak Leaves on her funnels. The MIDs were received for her assistance in radar research as a target and tracking vessel. At various times, she was fitted with temporary Radar Sets and advanced communication gear, but only for testing purposes. Upon being paid off, Charny was no longer considered viable, and she was deemed surplus. In 1957, she was scuttled as a derelict, offshore of Sydney, Nova Scotia.

The Condor class had a protective deck of to steel over machinery and boilers. The guns were equipped with gun shields which had armour. Service history =Royal Navy= Shearwater was commissioned at Chatham 24 October 1901 by Commander Charles Henry Umfreville, with a complement of 104 officers and men. She left the Nore in early November to relieve on the Royal Navy's Pacific Station. In July 1902 she toured the Bering Sea. The station itself was suspended in 1905, and the facilities at Esquimalt, British Columbia passed to the Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries. Shearwater and remained at Esquimalt, and in 1910 the Naval Service Bill was passed, creating the Royal Canadian Navy. Shearwater recommissioned, still as a Royal Navy vessel, at Esquimalt on 27 November 1912. At the onset of the First World War, Algerine and Shearwater were deployed as part of an international squadron off the coast of Mexico, protecting foreign interests during their civil war.

After discussions between the Royal Canadian Navy and the Admiralty Shearwater recommissioned on 8 September 1914 as a submarine tender for the Canadian s at Esquimalt. She was transferred permanently in 1915 to the Royal Canadian Navy, becoming HMCS Shearwater. In 1917 Shearwater escorted the two submarines to Halifax, transiting through the Panama Canal. For the remainder of the war, she saw very limited duty as a Royal Canadian Navy support vessel on the Atlantic coast, mostly spent training with the CC-class submarines in Baddeck Bay.Johnston et al., pp. 781‚Äì782.

Canada is considered to be the nucleus of the Royal Canadian Navy for her role in training Canadian naval officers and asserting Canadian sovereignty. Canada saw service in the First World War and was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Canada during that conflict. Following the war, the vessel was sold for commercial use and renamed MV Queen of Nassau. On the verge of being sold again, the ship sank in Straits of Florida on 2 July 1926. Description Canada was long as ordered, but ended up long. The ship had a beam of and a draught of . Canada had a ram bow. The ship had a tonnage of and a displacement of . The ship was propelled by two shafts powered by a triple expansion steam engine rated at . The ship's maximum speed is different among the sources, ranging from as low as to as high as . The ship could carry of coal for fuel. The ship was initially fitted with four 3-pounder guns. For naval service, the ship was rearmed with two 12-pounder and two 3-pounder guns. Canada was fitted with a Marconi wireless, a device just being installed aboard much larger British warships at the time. Service history =Civilian service= As part of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier's efforts to relieve Great Britain's overall commitment to North American defence in the wake of the Boer War, the Laurier government sought to develop the Fisheries Protection Service. As part of this effort, the government ordered a patrol ship in 1903‚Äì1904 for service on the East Coast of Canada. Canada was laid down by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, England and launched on 15 June 1904. The ship was completed in July that year. Canada arrived at Quebec City on 29 September after undergoing a two-week inspection at Gasp√©, Quebec. The ship then sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia to install the Marconi wireless and more sea trials. The original group of Canadian naval cadets serving in CGS Canada In January 1905, with naval militia recruits aboard, the ship was sent to the Caribbean Sea to join Royal Navy naval exercises there. Canadas participation in Royal Navy fleet exercises in 1905 is considered by some to be the beginnings of Canada's naval activity. The patrol vessel's planned Caribbean cruise in 1907 was cancelled due to personnel requirements. In 1908, the Canadian government sought to build a naval militia around Canada. This was soon put off as the department came under investigation. That year Canada took part in Quebec City's tercentenary celebrations. In 1908, Canada became a training ship for officer cadets for the planned Canadian navy. Thus CGS Canada became Canada's first naval training ship and was, as stated by naval historians in Canada, the \\"Flagship of the embryonic Canadian Navy at the time, symbolic of the evolution of Canada from a dominion within the British Empire to a sovereign nation.\\" In 1909, the Fisheries crew was removed from the ship and volunteers from the Royal Navy Reserve were brought aboard to provide a higher level of naval training. However, Canada continued to be used as a fisheries patrol vessel. In 1910, the Canadian navy was formed Canada escorted one of the nation's newly acquired cruisers, , into Halifax Harbour, with the new navy's cadets and the Director of the Naval Service, Rear Admiral Charles Kingsmill, aboard. =HMCS Canada= As HMCS Canada, during the First World War After the First World War broke out in August 1914, Canada was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy on 4 August. The ship then underwent a refit that rearmed her with more powerful weaponry and raised Canadas forecastle. The ship was commissioned as HMCS Canada on 25 January 1915 and served on the Atlantic coast as an anti-submarine patrol vessel. In June 1915, Canada escorted four H-class submarines from Quebec City to Newfoundland. In July 1915, Canada with , escorted two troopships through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. However, both ships needed long refits afterwards and did not return to service until September. By 1917, Canadas boilers were worn out and needed replacement. On 6 December 1917 she was one of the ships anchored at HMC Dockyard in Halifax Harbour during the Halifax Explosion. She suffered minor damage and one crew member was seriously injured. In 1918, Canada was among the Canadian naval vessels used to escort convoys from Quebec City through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Following the end of the war, HMCS Canada was decommissioned in November 1919. =Queen of Nassau= In 1920, Canada was offered for sale at a price of $25,000. When no one purchased her, she was laid-up in Halifax. In 1921, Canada was offered to the Navy League of Canada for free, but the Navy League could not afford the insurance and other costs associated with the ship, and the offer was declined. After four years of neglect she was sold to Florida Inter Islands Steam Ship Company and then re- sold to Florida real estate entrepreneur Barron Gift Collier Sr.. The ship was renamed MV Queen of Nassau and pressed into service passenger service between Miami, Florida and Nassau, Bahamas. This was a service for which she was poorly equipped, lacking comfortable overnight accommodations for the island cruise, as well as air conditioning. Passengers rapidly lost interest in the service and once again the ship sat idle and rusting, this time for 18 months in Biscayne Bay. Collier announced some Mexican investors were interested in purchasing the ship for service in the Gulf of Mexico in June 1926. The ship left Miami in ballast on 30 June 1926 for Tampa, Florida to undergo a final inspection before the sale. After stopping twice in the Straits of Florida due to problems with her boilers, she began taking on water on 2 July 1926. At first her three pumps were enough to keep her afloat but when flooding reached her engine room, the boilers cooled and then failed, leaving no power for the pumps. The 18-person crew abandoned ship and shortly after 7:00 pm the vessel slipped below the waves stern-first in of water off Islamorada. The site of the wreck is located south of Miami and roughly south of Lower Matecumbe Key. Wreck site The wreck was located by technical divers in 2001 and rests in of water off of Islamorada, Florida. In March 2003, the site was the focus of an archaeological investigation by a NOAA team consisting of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, East Carolina University, National Undersea Research Center (NURC) at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and videographer Rick Allen and Kimberly Faulk from Nautilus Productions. Nautilus Productions provided site documentation, documented the archaeological survey and recorded diving activities during the dives. The wreck is encrusted with oysters, as well as sponges, corals, and other invertebrate growth and rests upright on a white, sandy bottom. Archaeologists are working toward designating the wreck a U.S. National Historic Site because of the significance it holds in the evolution of Canada's military.

Originally launched as the yacht Czarina, she was acquired by John Craig Eaton in 1910 and renamed Florence. Following the outbreak of war, Eaton donated the yacht to the Royal Canadian Navy. The ship had a short career and proved unsuitable for navy work and was paid off in September 1916. The vessel was subsequently sold to buyers in Martinique, and was reportedly lost in the Caribbean Sea in January 1917. Description The vessel was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The vessel had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 237 when built and 257 during service with the Royal Canadian Navy. The yacht, of steel construction, had a maximum speed of when constructed with reported speeds of up to . However, by the time Florence reached Royal Canadian Navy service, the vessel's maximum speed was just . During naval service, the ship was armed with one forward-mounted QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun. Construction and career One of the many yachts built for tycoons in the eastern United States, the steam yachts were used for commuting on rivers in cities such as New York City or Washington, D.C.. They were usually comfortable but fast and were intended to be used for commuting from work to luxurious homes on Long Island or along Chesapeake Bay. The yacht was constructed by Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey, with the yard number 105 and launched in 1903 as Czarina. The vessel was built for Charles S. Bryan. The vessel was renamed Emeline before being sold to John Eaton in 1908, who again renamed the yacht to Florence, after his wife in 1910. Florence was then brought to Toronto, Ontario. During the First World War the Royal Canadian Navy was tasked with creating a patrol force for the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Coast of Canada. In August 1914, Eaton offered Florence for use by the Royal Canadian Navy but was turned down. Eaton then had Florence laid up while he focused on other war efforts. In June 1915, the Royal Canadian Navy searched for vessels capable of performing patrol duties and Eaton donated Florence to the navy for $1 on 8 July 1915. The vessel was handed over to the navy in Montreal, Quebec and underwent conversion at Canadian Vickers to a warship, having her hull strengthened and receiving her armament. The Royal Canadian Navy commissioned the vessel on 19 July 1915. While in transit to the Atlantic Coast, Florence collided with the merchant vessel on 22 July, suffering some damage. Initially assigned to patrols of the Bay of Fundy, Florence also patrolled from the north shore of Quebec along the Saint Lawrence River to the west coast of Newfoundland and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The ship was based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. However, Florence was considered unseaworthy in heavy weather and was used as a guard ship at Saint John, New Brunswick. During the winter months, Florence was laid up and underwent a refit starting 22 December to fix issues that arose during patrols. However, as spring approached, it was decided to not bring the ship back into service and plans were drawn up to return the vessel to Eaton. This was rejected and instead the Royal Canadian Navy chose to sell the vessel instead. For the next five months, the vessel remained laid up at Saint John. Florence was paid off on 21 September 1916 and sold to a trading company in Martinique. In January 1917, the yacht was lost in the Caribbean Sea.

Launched in 1912 as the private yacht Winchester of the American industrialist Peter Rouss, the vessel was constructed along the lines of a contemporary Royal Navy torpedo boat destroyer. After the outbreak of war, vessels that could be used by belligerents was prohibited by the government of the then-neutral United States. Canadian millionaire J. K. L. Ross purchased Winchester and returned to Canada with the yacht, where he transferred ownership of the vessel to the Royal Canadian Navy. Renamed Grilse, a pseudonym for Atlantic salmon and converted to a patrol boat, the vessel was deployed as part of Canada's east coast patrol combating the German submarine threat. After the war, she was sold back to private interests, re-converted to a yacht and renamed Trillora. Trillora foundered in 1938 at Long Island, New York during a hurricane. Description and design The vessel was built as the high-speed civilian yacht Winchester by Peter W. Rouss, who was born in Winchester, Virginia. She was built along the lines of a torpedo-boat destroyer with twin funnels, a low hull with little flare in her bow. The vessel had a raised forecastle which extended back to form a compass platform over the saloon. The bridge was and extension of the forecastle deck and was surrounded by a canvas dodger. The tall mast was placed amidships. She was comparable in size to an E-class destroyer from 1901‚Äì1904, however Winchester was considered faster due to her turbine engines. The vessel measured long between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . As a yacht, Winchester had a gross register tonnage of 275 tons and in naval service, Grilse had a displacement of . The ship had a maximum speed of and a ship's company of 56 in Canadian service. Service history Constructed for Peter Rouss the son of an industrialist, the yacht was built by Yarrows Shipbuilding at their Scotstoun yard in Glasgow, Scotland. The third of Rouss' vessels named Winchester, the yacht was launched in 1912 and completed in June of that year. In 1915, Canadian industrialist and millionaire Jack Ross was sent to the United States to acquire ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. Ross purchased Winchester for $100,000. At the time, an embargo was in place preventing the sale of any ship to belligerents in the war. The American government discovered the sale and attempted to block the transaction, but Ross managed to get out of the country with the ship. Ross was later reimbursed by the federal government. After arrival in Halifax, Nova Scotia it was arranged for the conversion of Winchester for military use. The ship was sent to Canadian Vickers in Montreal and armed with two 12-pounder guns, one fore, placed on the forecastle and one aft, placed on the quarterdeck. A torpedo tube was sited amidships. The aft deckhouse was removed to make room for the torpedo tube and the three torpedoes that were to be carried on deck. The mast was moved forward to directly behind the bridge and a second mast was installed to give the vessel a horizontal antenna to improve radio communications. There were also some alterations to the crew quarters to make room for the larger number required in a warship. Grilse was commissioned as a torpedo boat on 15 July 1915 with Ross in command and operated off Canada's east coast for much of the war. Her intended use as the most powerful Canadian warship on the east coast following the laying up of the cruiser , was as the primary offensive unit to any sighting of enemy ships. Spending the better part of her service with the Halifax patrol, she was loaned to the Gulf patrol in September 1915 and operated as a ship escort in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The vessel was eventually withdrawn from inspection duties along the coast due to the high cost of use and was relegated to patrol duties only. Unsuitable for winter operations in Canadian waters, Grilse was sent to the Caribbean Sea during the winter months. In 1915, she was sent to Jamaica, running out of fuel on the way and requiring a tow from the cruiser . In December 1916 the ship was sent to join the North America and West Indies Station, but encountered a heavy storm on the way and nearly sank. Headquarters actually believed the ship destroyed after they lost communications with Grilse (her antenna had been lost in the storm) and sent out vessels to search for wreckage. However, Grilse had managed to make it back to Shelburne. She was then towed to Halifax for a refit. The ship re-entered service on 10 May 1917 and was used as a patrol ship until August later that year when she returned to the dockyard to undergo repairs. She returned to escort and patrol duty until the end of the war. Grilse was paid off on 10 December 1918. Attempts to sell Grilse as surplus in 1920 were unsuccessful, and she was used for training purposes in 1921‚Äì22 before being sold to Solomon Guggenheim in 1922. The vessel was towed to the United States, refitted as a yacht and renamed Trillora. The ship was still in Guggenheim's ownership when she foundered in Long Island Sound in the New England Hurricane of 1938 on 21 September 1938. The United States Coast Guard ordered the wreck removed and Guggenheim transferred ownership to a salvage company. The yacht's registry was closed in October 1941.

Acquired by Canada in 1902 Gulnare was refitted and used for tidal and current survey work on the East Coast and the lower Saint Lawrence River. As one of the ships in the Canadian Hydrographic Survey, she was transferred from the Department of Marine and Fisheries to the Department of Naval Service when the latter was created in 1910.

Hochelaga is a historic name associated with Canada, the voyages of Jacques Cartier, and the city of Montreal. Initially constructed as the yacht Waturus (alternatively spelled Walrus or Waterus) in 1900 in Europe, the vessel was sold to an American in 1902. The ship was acquired in 1914 for use as a patrol vessel on the East Coast of Canada. Following World War I, the vessel became a ferry between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. After World War II the ship was renamed HaChayal Ha'Ivri () and used for illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. The vessel was scrapped in 1950. Design and description The vessel was initially constructed as a yacht with a clipper bow. The ship had a gross register tonnage of 578 tons and had a length overall of , a beam of and a draught of . The yacht was propelled by a steam-powered reciprocating engine and had a maximum speed of . In Canadian naval service, the ship displaced and mounted one 12-pounder gun. Service history Launched at Leith, Scotland by Hawthorn & Company in 1900, the ship was originally named Waturus, and was owned by Charles Stephen, the Archduke of Austria. The archduke sold the vessel to Randal Morgan, an American, in 1902 for $150,000 and Morgan paid a further $40,000 to refit the yacht. Morgan took part in yacht races with Waturus along the East Coast of the United States. During World War I, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) sought suitable vessels for patrol service along the East Coast of Canada following warnings of increased U-boat activity. Finding few available in Canada, the RCN sent agents south to the United States to acquire ships. The RCN sent Aemilius Jarvis to acquire two yachts in New York City in July 1915\\\\. Waturus, which was for sale by the shipbrokers Cox & Stevens for $80,000 in 1914, was one of the two Jarvis acquired for the RCN. The ship was renamed Hochelaga, commissioned on 13 August 1915, and sailed to Montreal for conversion to an armed yacht. Hochelaga arrived at Sydney, Nova Scotia in September for duty on the Atlantic coast as a patrol vessel. The vessel was part of the East Coast patrol from 1916 to 1918. The ship was present in Halifax Harbour during the Halifax Explosion and suffered damage, with several crew members injured in the blast. On 21 August 1918 Hochelaga, while performing an anti-submarine patrol with a small flotilla of four ships off the coast of Nova Scotia, encountered the German submarine while the submarine was in the process of boarding and sinking Canadian fishing schooners. The commanding officer of Hochelaga, Lieutenant R.D. Legate, ordered the ship to turn and head back towards the flotilla instead of intercepting the enemy. For failing to confront the enemy, Lieutenant Legate was placed under arrest and court-martialled in Halifax in October. Legate was found guilty and dismissed from the service. Hochelaga remained on the Atlantic patrol until the end of the war and remained in RCN service until 1920. The ship was briefly reactivated for active duty in July 1919 for the visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada and carried several guests, among them Admiral Sir Charles Kingsmill and the Governor General of Canada, along the St. Lawrence and Saguenay Rivers. In October 1919 Hochelaga was sent to tour the lighthouses and ship radio stations along the coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland. Hochelaga was paid off on 30 October 1920 and put up for sale. The vessel was not sold until 23 February 1923 when John Simon of Halifax acquired the vessel. In 1923 Hochelaga, operated by Hochelaga Shipping and Towing Co., of Halifax, became a Pictou-Charlottetown ferry. It was sold again in 1942 to Thomas C. Wilwerth of New York, who attempted to change the vessel's coal-fired steam engines to modern oil-burning ones at Sullivan Shipyard in Brooklyn. When the US government took over the yard as part of the war effort, Wilwerth was forced to move the vessel on his own, but this proved too difficult and he took Hochelaga to Todd Shipyards to complete the conversion. It was during this period that the United States Coast Guard inspected the vessel and found several plates needed to be replaced and the number of crew increased to 24. On 3 July 1943, the vessel was seized by the United States Marshals Service due to unpaid bills. Hochelaga was in turn sold to a subsidiary of the United Fruit Company for use in the sugar trade with Puerto Rico. The United Fruit Company sold the vessel at the end of the war. Between 1945 and 1946, the vessel's record becomes difficult to track, but the ship reappeared in 1946 registered to Em. Fostinis of Marseille and flagged in Honduras. Operated by Cra Mar. Las Palmas the vessel was renamed HaChayal Ha'Ivri and used in a 1946 attempt to carry Jewish immigrants to Palestine (now known as Israel), at the time controlled by the British. Departing Antwerp on 14 July 1946 and carrying some 550 passengers, she was seized off Haifa by the British destroyer . The vessel was taken to Cyprus and remained listed to 1953, but the ultimate fate of the vessel is unknown.

After the war, she was sold for civilian service and scrapped in 1936. Description Originally constructed as a passenger liner, the ship was long between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a tonnage of . The ship was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine driving two shafts. The ship had a maximum speed of . In Royal Canadian Navy service the ship was armed with one gun and one QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun. Service history Deerhound was built by John Jones and Sons in 1901 at their yard in Tranmere, Merseyside with the yard number 180. The ship was constructed for the North Pier Steam Ship Company Limited of Blackpool and completed in May 1901\\\\. In 1905 the North Pier Steam Ship Company sold the vessel to the West Cornwall Steam Ship Company. From 1905 to 1907 she operated between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly, replacing the older ship, Lady of the Isles. Canada's Postmaster General purchased Deerhound in 1907 at a cost of some $65,000 to act as a mail tender for transatlantic steamers. Renamed Lady Evelyn, she met ocean liners in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to transfer mail to and from trains at Rimouski, Quebec in order to speed its delivery. She replaced Rhoda, an older and smaller ship that had previously performed these duties. In 1914 Lady Evelyn was involved in the rescue of survivors from when that ship sank following a collision off Rimouski. Lady Evelyn was one of a number of Canadian government ships taken over by the Royal Canadian Navy during the First World War. Commissioned in June 1917, she spent her career on the East Coast. The ship's ability as a patrol vessel was limited by her 9-knot maximum speed. However, the ship was still assigned to seaward patrols against German U-boats, even though the ship was not capable of operating in heavy seas. At the time of the December 1917 Halifax Explosion, Lady Evelyn was patrolling off the harbour's approaches. On 18 August 1918 Lady Evelyn dropped depth charges on a possible submarine contact after spotting a periscope. As attacks on shipping in Canadian waters increased, Lady Evelyn was used to escort convoys. Following the war, the ship was decommissioned in 1919. In 1921 Lady Evelyn was sold to the Gulf of St Lawrence Sg & Tdg Company of Montreal. A year later, the Howe Sound Navigation Co. brought Lady Evelyn to Vancouver. In 1923 she was bought by the Union Steamship Company of British Columbia for service along the West Coast and remained with them until 1936. The ship was sold for scrap and broken up in Bedwell Bay in the fourth quarter of 1936.

The highway serves the town of Gabbs following Gabbs Valley Road through the extreme northwestern tip of Nye County. Gabbs is isolated from the rest of the county, requiring travel on SR 361 through other counties in order to reach any other major town in Nye County. SR 361 was previously known as State Route 23. Route description First reassurance sign along northbound SR 361, July 2014 State Route 361 in Mineral County at a junction with U.S. Route 95 approximately northwest of Luning. From there, the highway heads north towards the mountains of the Gabbs Valley Range. The route curves sharply east to climb up to Calavada Summit (elevation ), and then turns northward again to pass over Petrified Summit (elevation ) before leaving the mountain range. Route 361 then heads northeast, entering Gabbs Valley and Nye County as it approaches the town of Gabbs. As the highway heads out of Gabbs it intersects State Route 844, providing access to the Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park and Ione via the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. SR 361 continues north from here, reentering Mineral County briefly before entering Churchill County. The route comes to an end at an intersection with U.S. Route 50 at Middlegate. History SR 361 was formerly known as State Route 23. Beginning of southbound SR 361 in Middlegate, May 2014 The general routing of present-day SR 361 first appeared on state highway maps in 1929 as an unpaved road, State Route 23. By 1939, the portion of the route in Mineral and Nye Counties had been realigned further east. The final alignment of SR 23, shown as a paved highway, was in place by 1946. The route remained relatively unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's highway system. On July 1, the SR 23 designation was replaced by State Route 361.

Biography Porter graduated from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, California in 1966. He rose to fame as a member of the Doobie Brothers, replacing bassist Dave Shogren on their second album Toulouse Street in 1972.Aronie, Dan - GuitarShowCase; accessed December 31, 2015. His vocals were mostly restricted to the background in the studio, although he wrote and sang \\"For Someone Special\\" (a tribute to ill bandleader Tom Johnston) on the album Takin' It To The Streets (1976) and the creatively syncopated \\"Need A Lady\\" on the album Livin' On The Fault Line (1977). In concert, Porter usually performed lead vocals on one or two songs. Porter's most notable contributions to the Doobie Brothers' sound were his busy and punchy bass lines; his distinctive tone permeates all of the band's classic compositions and hits. Often pictured with his trusty Alembic or Gibson basses during the seventies (usually with a Thunderbird or Ripper bass and earlier with an EB-0L), Porter played Fender instruments, most notably the Fender Jazz Bass, along with BC Rich Eagles and Rickenbackers. His early technique, with rich chordal attack, was based mostly on his picking style, favoring the guitar pick over fingerstyle playing. The hit title track from Takin' It to the Streets, which prominently features Porter's thundering, picked notes, is a prime example of this technique. More recently, even performing the old repertoire with the Doobies, Porter has been playing new, custom-made instruments almost exclusively finger style.Fox, Brian. Bass Player Magazine; accessed December 31, 2015. Porter left the Doobies in 1980, citing frustration with the hectic and constant touring schedule. His replacement was session man Willie Weeks, later famous for his collaboration with Michael Jackson and other Quincy Jones prot√©g√©s. After guesting onstage with his former bandmates briefly during the 1982 farewell tour, he rejoined the Doobies in 1987. Porter played on Cycles (1989), whose title was taken from an unused song he wrote,Liner notes from Playing To An Empty House and Brotherhood (1991). Neither album featured a Porter composition or lead vocal, and his bass is often buried in the mix. After five years of touring in support of Cycles and Brotherhood, Porter finally quit the Doobies for good in 1992. He was reportedly still frustrated with constant touring and the band's preference for recording familiar sounding material instead of his own, more diverse compositions. Porter released a self-produced solo album, Playing to an Empty House, in 1995. It is a mix of rock, progressive, and jazz spotlighting Porter on all of the instruments and vocals. The album features surprising jazz solos sculpted on exotic chord progressions. (Strangely, it features little or no bass guitar, focusing instead on lead guitar and sequenced keyboards.) Currently, Porter plays bass with singer song writer Keith Greeninger from Santa Cruz California who just released a new CD called Human Citizen. With beautiful lyrics and a tribute to our fallen soldiers. Porter use to play bass with California-based Beatles tribute band White Album Ensemble as well as Stormin' Norman and the Cyclones. He has toured with Moby Grape during its occasional partial reunions.

Description This subspecies is typically a light tan in color, with darker brown, wide crossbands. Their actual color varies by locality, varying from a red-brown, to a gray-brown. The species can be difficult to distinguish from the broad-banded copperhead, A. c. laticinctus. The only notable physical difference between the subspecies is that the Trans-Pecos copperhead tends to have an elaborately patterned underside, often being an irregular, white and black pattern whereas the broad-banded tends to be plain white, only have minimal patterning, or have elongated random blotching instead of a distinct pattern. The subspecies intergrade where their ranges overlap, further confusing identification. It is easily distinguished from other subspecies of copperhead, in that other species typically have banding that narrows at the spine, creating hourglass shapes, whereas A. c. pictigaster has bands that do not narrow at the spine. They grow to approximately 20-36 inches (50‚Äì90 cm) in length. As juveniles, all species of Agkistrodon have a bright green-yellow color to their tail tip believed to be used as a lure to attract prey items to approach within striking range. The color fades to a grey or brown at about a year of age. Behavior Like all A. contortrix subspecies, A. c. pictigaster is a nocturnal ambush predator. Their diet consists of primarily lizards, frogs, and rodents. Their choice of habitat is the driest among the copperhead subspecies, preferring rocky, lightly vegetated, canyon areas. They are ovoviviparous, giving birth to a litter of up to 8 young in the early fall. Venom Like most pit viper species, A. contortrix has a hemotoxic venom, which is delivered through hinged, hollow fangs set in the front of their jaw. The fangs work like hypodermic needles, injecting the venom in a single, quick striking motion. Copperhead venom is not considered to be life-threatening to an otherwise healthy adult, but it can cause localized swelling, necrosis, and severe pain. Any bite from a venomous snake should be considered serious and medical treatment sought. There is no antivenin specifically manufactured for copperheads, but CroFab, which makes use of the venom from the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), can be used in cases of a severe envenomation.

Geographic range Agkistrodon laticinctus is known to populate the region between 97 degrees and 99 degrees west longitude, from Central Texas north to the southern border of Kansas and Oklahoma. Behavior Secretive and nocturnal, it prefers lightly wooded habitats, typically with a good amount of ground debris for cover, not far from a permanent water source. It typically avoids regions with a significant population of humans. It is an ambush predator, eating rodents, birds, lizards, anurans, and certain insects, with juveniles in particular having a taste for various kinds of insects, such as cicadas. Wide foraging of caterpillars has also been documented in the field.Salmon, G. T., H. W. Greene, and T. Dimler. \\"Biology of the Pitvipers 2.\\" Biology of the Pitvipers 2.

Copperhead venom is not considered to be life- threatening to an otherwise healthy adult, but it can cause localized swelling, necrosis, and severe pain. Any bite from a venomous snake should be considered serious and medical treatment sought. There is no antivenin specifically manufactured for copperheads. However, CroFab, which makes use of the venom from the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), can be used in cases of a severe envenomation.

The name was derived from it being promoted by Hopalong Casity. QT50s were popular in the late 1970s and 1980s because of their ease of use and maintenance, extreme fuel efficiency, and legality in most U.S. states among pre-driving-age teenagers. QT50s and other mopeds are enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to their fuel efficiency and nostalgic appeal. The QT50 and the similar Honda Express share a skeletal, almost insect-like appearance. The Yamahopper is not really a scooter, as the QT50 has no fairing, sports footpegs rather than footboards, and its two-stroke reed valve engine is slung beneath the monotube frame motorcycle-style. The QT50 closely resembles contemporary mopeds, but without the bicycle pedals typical to the class, leading some to refer to such vehicles as \\"nopeds.\\" The Yamahopper has an approximate top speed of 30 mph in stock form, and thus can be used for city driving. The compact, weatherproof drivetrain of the Yamahopper resembles a minimalist version of the enclosed shaft drivetrains of most BMW motorcycles. Its simple, maintenance-free shaft-drive contained in the single-sided swingarm eliminates chain maintenance, safety and wear concerns as well as weather wear factors and contributes to the durability and ease of use of these tiny motorbikes. The drive unit also incorporates a traditional centrifugal clutch but only a single speed gearing, unlike most mopeds which have two speeds. The simplified driveshaft setup makes wheel changes easy. Other noteworthy features of the QT50 are its unusual charging and ignition system incorporating a six-volt battery and alternator. This system eases cold starting: when the key is placed in the \\"start\\" position,the ignition supplies a stronger than normal spark for initial starting, but does not allow the engine to rev so as to avoid burning the piston. Once kicked to life with the reverse-mounted, left-side kickstart lever, the key is turned to \\"run\\" and the engine is able to rev freely. Popular modifications include: Yamaha YT60 cylinder, piston and rings. Yamaha MJ50 Towny two-speed crankcase and right-side swingarm. Yamaha PW50 rear gears. Mikuni VM15 and VM18 carburetors. Jemco exhaust, etc. The YF60's(quad), YT60's(atv), MJ50's(noped) and PW50's(mini dirtbike) engines were all derived from the QT50's engine and all parts are interchangeable though some parts are slightly different, for example all model's right side crankcase half have right side trailing arm mounts, except for the QT50.

Prior to entering service with the RCN, the vessel was the private yacht Columbia. Following the war, Stadacona performed hydrographic surveys. The vessel was sold for commercial use in 1920 and was burned for salvage in 1948. Stadacona is a historic name associated with Canada, the voyages Jacques Cartier, the colony of Samuel de Champlain, and Quebec City. Origins The vessel was built by Crescent Shipyard, Elizabeth, New Jersey as the American steam yacht Columbia, the second yacht of that name built for J. Harvey Ladew of New York, and modeled on the United States Coast Survey steamer that had been built in the same yard.There has been confusion between the two yachts. The first of 1894 was built by Cramp Shipbuilding and later commissioned by the United States Navy in 1898 as ‚Äîbefore the second was completed at Crescent. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships gives an erroneous 1898 build date along with an 11 April 1898 commissioning date for the Cramp Shipbuilding Columbia when contemporary accounts clearly show the second yacht is still being built in 1899. To complicate matters further, the article here uses the commissioning date to distinguish the vessel while the data shows construction starting five years. Possible conversion into a naval auxiliary was a part of the design with coal-fired triple-expansion steam engines, capable of a guaranteed , allowing for steaming range of and a sail plan allowing even longer ranges. She was acquired by Aemilius Jarvis on behalf of the RCN in July 1915 along with the yacht Waterus from the New York shipbrokers Cox and Stevens for $155,000. (The sales were blocked by the then-neutral U.S. government, and prolific champion yachtsman Commodore Jarvis subsequently had to pirate the ships from the U.S. to Canada.) Columbia was renamed Stadacona, after a small Iroquois village which had previously occupied the site of Quebec City. Canadian service Stadacona was one of a number of American private yachts acquired by the RCN during the First World War. The vessel was commissioned into the RCN on 13 August 1915. Stadacona was then sent to the Canadian Vickers shipyard in Montreal, Quebec to fit out. The vessel was given one gun forward and a 12-pounder gun was added aft later in the war. The vessel then sailed to Sydney, Nova Scotia to begin her career as a patrol vessel in September. In 1916 Stadacona was among the vessels assigned to patrol the Cabot Strait. The vessel became flagship of the Canada's East Coast fleet based at Halifax under Vice Admiral Sir Charles Coke on 30 April 1916. Stadacona remained flagship of the fleet after Walter Hose took over command from Sir Charles Coke on 14 August. In August 1918 the German U-boat captured the fishing trawler Triumph off the East Coast of Canada. Using the trawler to get close to the Atlantic fishing fleets, the Germans sank several Canadian and American fishing trawlers. Stadacona was among the vessels dispatched to deal with the submarine. However, the Germans scuttled Triumph once the fishing trawler ran out of fuel. In early 1919 Stadacona, accompanied by a number of s, was sent to the west coast via the Panama Canal. She served as a dispatch vessel until being paid off on 31 March 1920, and transferred to government service. The vessel was then used primarily used for hydrographic surveys and occasionally for fisheries patrol along the west coast until sold in 1924. Sale and subsequent career Sold in 1924, Stadacona became the West Coast rum running depot ship Kuyakuzmt during Prohibition before being rebuilt in 1929 at Vancouver as the yacht Lady Stimson. In 1931 the yacht was converted to a tugboat and renamed Moonlight Maid.The sources disagree on when the vessel became a tugboat, with the Miramar Ship Index stating 1931 and Macpherson and Barrie, 1941. During World War II the tugboat was acquired by the United States Army and converted to a cargo vessel in 1942 and operated as the coastal freighter, U.S. Army FS-539. In 1948, she was burned for salvage at Seattle, Washington and broken up by Foss Launch & Tug Co. See also HMCS Stadacona was also the name of an RCN shore establishment in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The ship was initially intended to be a fisheries patrol vessel but was turned over to Customs Preventative Service shortly after launch. Constance had two sisters, and . Constance was paid for in part when the department sold the small patrol vessel Cruiser to Polson Iron Works. There was some concern in the United States over the construction of these vessels on the Great Lakes, claiming that it might be in contravention of the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty. Constance was initially assigned to patrol the Saint Lawrence River and upper Gulf of St. Lawrence. Constances role was to intercept suspicious vessels in Canadian waters and investigating them for illicit cargo and goods. If found, Constance would then escort the vessel to a Canadian port. Proceeds from any interception were distributed among the crew. Although at work for the Customs Preventative Service of Canada, the ship was nominally owned by the Department of Marine and Fisheries.

His real name was Antonio Mamerto Gil N√∫√±ez and he was allegedly born in the area of Pay Ubre, nowadays Mercedes, Corrientes, possibly in the 1840s, and died on 8 January 1878. He is regarded as the most prominent folk hero in Argentina, with smaller areas of veneration reported in Paraguay, Chile and Brazil.  Legend  Popular accounts vary, but in broad terms the legend tells that Antonio Gil was born in the 1840s as a farm worker in a ranch and a devout believer in the folk saint San La Muerte. It is said that the owner of the ranch, a wealthy widow named Estrella Diaz Miraflores, fell in love, or had an affair, with him, but when her brothers and the head of the local police (who was also in love with Miraflores) found out about their relationship, they accused him of robbery and tried to kill him. He enlisted in the army to escape from them, fighting against the Paraguayan army. When the war ended, he returned home and was welcomed as a hero. But when he arrived at his village, he was forcibly recruited by the Colorados to return to the army and fight in the Argentine Civil War against the Liberal parties. Once he was tired of fighting, he decided to desert and became an outlaw. In the years following his desertion, he acquired a reputation as a Robin Hood figure, for his efforts to protect and help the needy, the poor, and those who suffered in extreme poverty. Many locals stated that \\"Gauchito\\" Gil had miraculous healing powers and the ability of hypnosis, and that he was apparently immune to bullets.http://www.cuco.com.ar/gauchito_gil.htm Traditional roadside shrine to Gauchito Gil in Santiago del Estero Province. On January 8, 1878, the local police, led by Colonel Vel√°zquez, caught him hiding in a forest after a party and took him about 8 kilometers away from Mercedes. There, they tortured him over a fire and hanged him from his feet on an algarrobo tree, preparing to execute him. When the police sergeant was about to kill him, Gauchito Gil said to him: \\"You are going to kill me now, but you will arrive in Mercedes tonight at the same time as a letter of my pardon. In the letter they will also tell you that your son is dying of a strange illness. If you pray and beg me to save your child, I promise you that he will live. If not, he will die.\\" The sergeant laughed at this, and responded, \\"I don't care,\\" and killed Gauchito Gil by slitting his throat. When the sergeant returned to his village, he found a soldier there with a letter of pardon for Gil. The letter also said that the sergeant's son was very ill and on the brink of dying. Frightened, the sergeant prayed to Gauchito Gil for his son to be saved. The next day, his son was inexplicably cured; Gauchito Gil had healed the son of his murderer. Very grateful, the sergeant gave Gil's body a proper burial, and in his honor built a shrine in the form of a red cross. Moreover, he tried to let everybody know about the miracle. Current veneration Gauchito Gil shrine, Argentina. Closer view of Gauchito Gil shrine, Argentina. An image of Gauchito Gil (left) next to an image of San La Muerte (right). Gauchito Gil is thought to be a folk saint by many people of the Argentine provinces of Formosa, Corrientes, Chaco, the north of Santa Fe and even the province of Buenos Aires. One can spot smaller shrines of Gauchito Gil on roadsides throughout Argentina due to the red color and the flags, many of which read \\"Thanks, Gauchito Gil\\" if the person's request is fulfilled. The Sanctuary of Gauchito Gil (located about 8 km from the city of Mercedes) organizes great pilgrimages, to which more than 200,000 pilgrims annually head to the sanctuary to ask to the saint for favors. The Sanctuary has a mausoleum which holds the actual tomb of Gauchito Gil; plaques adorn the walls and state the names of those whose requests were granted by the saint. Moreover, each January 8 (date of Gil's death and his feast day), there is a large celebration honoring Gauchito Gil. Many pilgrims arrive and participate in festive activities, such as drinking, dancing, folklorical animal sports, and a procession that begins from the church in Mercedes to the Sanctuary. Paraphernalia related to the saint, including ribbons, rosaries, flags and statues, are often carried by the pilgrims and sold by vendors. Gauchito Gil statues are commonly seen next to images of San La Muerte, Our Lady of Luj√°n and other Catholic figures. Gauchito Gil is not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church, though many Argentines, both devotees and church leaders, have been promoting him for canonization. Local church leaders in Mercedes hold masses on his feast day in the Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Other church leaders in Argentina have participated and approved of the devotion of Gauchito Gil, while some are divided on whether to embrace or condemn the phenomenon. The Diocese of Goya and the Mexican Diocese of Celaya have both recognized the veneration of Gauchito Gil.http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201501/91088-gauchito-gil-peregrinacin- corrientes.htmlhttps://diocesisdecelaya.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/acompana-la- iglesia-el-fervor-por-el-gauchito-gil-2/ See also * Mar√≠a Lionza * Jos√© Gregorio Hern√°ndez * Jes√∫s Malverde References External links *\\"The Legend of Argentina's Gaucho Gil\\", NPR, byline Oct 10, 2004, accessed Nov. 14, 2007 *\\"Cultures of Devotion by Frank Graziano\\", academic website with images relating to Gaucho Gil and other Spanish American folk saints. *Gauchito (Curuz√∫) Gil at Folklore del Norte. *El Gauchito Gil at La Gu√≠a del Chaco. *'Reportage about Gauchito Gil' *Dos gauchos que atraen la veneraci√≥n popular. 19th-century births 1878 deaths People from Mercedes, Corrientes Argentine saints Argentine folklore Christian folklore Catholicism in Argentina Folk saints Wonderworkers Argentine legends ","title":"Gauchito Gil"},{"id":"5764538","title":"Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola"},{"id":"5764552","text":"NuFW is a software package that extends Netfilter, the Linux kernel-internal packet filtering firewall module. NuFW adds authentication to filtering rules. NuFW is also provided as a hardware firewall, in the EdenWall firewalling appliance. NuFW has been restarted by the FFI and renamed into UFWI.  Introduction  NuFW / UFWI is an extension of Netfilter which brings the notion of user to IP filtering. NuFW / UFWI can : * Authenticate any connection that goes through your gateway or only from/to a chosen subset or a specific protocol (iptables is used to select the connections to authenticate). * Perform accounting, routing and Quality of service (QOS) based on users and not simply on IPs. * Filter packets with criteria such as application and OS used by distant users. * Be the key of a secure and simple Single Sign On system.  Principles  NuFW / UFWI refuses the idea of IP  user as an IP address can easily be spoofed. It thus uses its own algorithm to perform authentication. It depends on two subsystems: Nufw which is connected to Netfilter and Nuauth which is connected to clients and Nufw. The algorithm is the following: File:NuFW Algorythm.png # A standard application sends a packet. # The Nufw client sees that a connection is being initiated and sends a user request packet. # The Nufw server queues the packet and sends an auth request packet to the Nuauth server. # The Nuauth server sums the auth request and the user request packet and checks this against an authentication authority. # The Nuauth server sends answer back to the Nufw server # The Nufw server transmits the packet following the answer given to its request. This algorithm realizes an A Posteriori authentication of the connection. As there is no time-based association, this ensures the identity of the user who sent the packet. NuFW is the only real Authentication firewall, as it never associates a user with his machine.

There was also a PlayStation version of the game released in Japan in 1997. Gameplay The game details a war of one group of insects battling against another. The battlefields are common household places such as the kitchen floor or the backyard. The player must navigate their bugs, each with special skills, and engage the enemies‚Äô bugs. The main objective of each battle is to either eradicate all of the enemy bugs or 'capture' every piece of food on the battlefield. This is achieved by positioning your bugs on the food long enough to raise a flag. When all pieces of food bear your team's flag, the battle is won. However, the enemy bugs will attempt to do the same thing and can reclaim captured food. The game develops the logical skills of the player. Different bugs are stronger and weaker versus other types of bugs so the player must combine different strategies to go to the next mission. There is also a multiplayer mode that can be played. It involves hot-seating between two players by pressing 'pause' on a virtual stopwatch, similar to the way that competitive chess is played. Reception Robert L.

She was a pioneer, in that she was the first to apply Egypt's traditional legacy of Folkloric Dances into a dramatised artistic form. Known for her sense of humour, she was known in Egypt in the 1930s as a child prodigy and from the 1940s to the 1960s for her many appearances in Egyptian films, her folkloric shows on Egyptian TV, and her company the \\"Nelly Mazloum Arabic Troupe of Dancer\\". The early years Nelly-Catherine Mazloum-Calvo was born in Alexandria, Egypt to wealthy Italian-Greek parents. Her father, who created jewellery, was an Italian from Naples and her mother, who was an able pianist, was Greek, from Asia Minor. They owned a hotel across the street from the Alhambra theatre. Mazloum suffered from paralysis of the legs (poliomyelitis) at the age of two, and walked again after years of care by a paediatrician and his wife who was a ballet dance teacher. For this reason, dance became her passion. At the age of five, she started a dance career as a solo dancer and was called by the media the prodigy child. In fact she was a child star from 1939‚Äì1945, she performed daily watched by her mother, who was her manager, working in Alexandria in the summer and in Cairo during the winter. The 10-year-old Mazloum appeared in her first film, I prosfygopoula (\\"The refugee girl\\", 1939), which was made in the Greek language and starred Sophia Vembo with a screenplay by D. Bogris. As a child she danced at the famous Casino Opera, run by Badia Masabni, where great Raqa Sharki dancers started their careers; there were two shows every day, a matinee for the whole family and an evening performance during which alcohol could be reserved. While Nelly was engaged as a child in the matinee shows and danced modern dance and classical ballet, once her own dancing was over, she stayed on to watch the evening show of belly dancers like Samia Gamal and Tahiya Karioka. On many occasions she appeared in front of King Farouk, in the same show as Samia Gamal and Umm Kulthum. In 1948 Nelly Mazloum became the prima Ballerina of the Royal Opera House in Cairo (Dar Al Opera) from 1959 to 1964 she was the choreographer of Al Masrah al Kaoumy (National Theatre), Koumeya troupe. For many years she gave innumerable Folkloric performance in local theatres and in various television shows in Egypt. The golden years In the 1940s and 1950s the strikingly beautiful and talented young performer danced and acted in the best Egyptian theatres, creating her own choreographies; she also performed/acted in about 17 films. Of those, she performed oriental dance only in a few. One is Shahrazad (1941) starring Hussein Sedky, Elham Hussein and Samia Gamal, the other one was Soliman's Ring (1946), directed by Hassan Ramzy (the uncle of percussionist Hossam Ramzy). Her daughter Marianna said during a lecture on Mazloum‚Äôs life and career in CID, UNESCO (International Dance Council) \\"My mother‚Äôs performance was in demand, as she had the privilege of being the only modern dancer in Egypt at that time.\\" Starting in 1947 she established a successful ballet school in Cairo for the girls of the elite society; she also taught and trained young artists for the National Opera House in Cairo (Dar Al Opera.) Mazloum liked the luxuries in life, and she enjoyed life to the full. She was married six times. She met her first husband A. Roussos in 1949, and this union produced a son, Emanuel and two years later a daughter, Marianna. During the early fifties, whenever the opportunity and time permitted, Mazloum travelled the whole country, observing and studying people‚Äôs dances in their original surroundings, from desert Bedouins to the Ghawazi (Gagar), in the villages, souks and cities, always looking for new dance movements. Marianna also mentioned during her lecture, ‚ÄúMy mother met and talked with remarkable human beings: teachers, musicians, writers, poets and archaeologists, who knew a lot about the culture and tradition of Egypt she was also an avid reader and researcher who studied books in the National Egyptian Museum, looking for descriptions of dances and costumes from ancient times; the director gave her special permission, provided she handled the fragile manuscripts with white gloves on. When attending private family parties of the elite, she would observe their dancing, which had a more refined style than the balady (Native) or the shaabi (Popular) ‚Äì she called that refined style: ‚Äòhawanem‚Äô\\" The Nelly Mazloum troupe Eventually, Mazloum divorced her husband, she reopened in 1951 her ballet school and in 1955 returned to performing and formed her own dance company; she established her folkloric dance school in Cairo for the training of the members of her company; she was the most famous folkloric dancer in Egypt who inspired a whole generation of dancers and choreographers at that time. She was the pioneer who attempted for the first time to apply Egypt‚Äôs traditional legacy of Folkloric Dances into a dramatized artistic form. The members of her company were all amateurs, some taken from her ballet school, some from the field of gymnastics, some were students and some had jobs.[2] Her troupe started with 25 people but soon grew to 40 dancers (20 female and 20 male) with a big orchestra. Her own theatrical company, inaugurate the Nelly Mazloum style, which was called by the media and the public ‚Äò Raqs el Ta'Biry‚Äô (Folk Dance) and was her own artistic elaboration and stylisation of the raw material of folk dances she had observed and studied. The programme included many scenes from rural life. She was the director, choreographer, performer and teacher of her own company. Marianna said in her lecture: ‚ÄúThe Company presented only the folkloric style of dance Raqs Shaabi, belly dancing at that time was not considered worthy of the theatre, it was only danced on the stage of Badia Masabni during the 40s, then during the 50s many solo dancers or small dance companies were mostly hired for parties, weddings, films and nightclubs..‚Äù In 1958, Mazloum‚Äôs dance company was showcased in the great Cotton Fair Festival, at the Grand Palais in Gezira. Mazloum was the first to present folkloric dances on stage and her dance company was the first Egyptian dance troupe to record Egyptian folk songs and dances from many different and remote regions of Egypt and perform them on stage and on television programs. In 1959-60, the Egyptian government founded the Egyptian National Ballet Academy under the direction of Alexei Jukov, who was assistant teacher of the Bolshoi Ballet School in Moscow and was provided by the then Soviet Union to the Egyptian government. Mazloum was appointed by the Ministry of Culture to be his assistant for the protection of the Egyptian content of Classical dance. A year later the National Ballet Academy was founded and for three years she was Jukov‚Äôs right hand. In 1961 another ambitious project was formed: the establishment of a National Folkloric Academy under the direction of another Russian, Boris Ramazin who was the first assistant and dancer of the ‚ÄúMoiseyev Dance Company‚Äù in Russia. Again Mazloum was his bridge to the local talent. He came to her in the morning, to learn the traditional movements of folkloric dances which he then taught to the students in the afternoon. However, when she saw that the Russians adulterated the Egyptian style and made it more Russian, she stopped her collaboration, and quit the job. But her experience with them was invaluable, helping her to organize her knowledge of technique and create a method for her own school ‚Äî what would emerge as the ‚ÄúNelly Mazloum Oriental Dance Technique.‚Äù It was a time of great political favour. The Minister of Culture, Dr. Sarwat Okasha, was so enthusiastic about her work that he used to buy tickets for the Egyptian people, so that everyone could see her shows. In 1961, he gave her Masrah al Ayem (floating theatre), which toured Egypt stopping to perform at every village.[6] Mazloum also did experimental styles like pharaonic dance (she presented it at the first 'Sound and light' show [6]), a \\"desert dance\\" with veil,[9] etc. One of her great successes was the biblical story Ayub el Masri, in 1961-1962.[10] It was also the year she and her company participated in the Helsinki International Youth Festival, where she was awarded the Silver Medal for her folkloric dances: Al Ghazl (the weaving of the bridal veil), for the first time in the history of Egypt‚Äôs a dancer represented Egypt. She became the official choreographer of the Cairo Opera, for opera and operetta productions. She choreographed, among others, Mahr el Aroussa (The bride's dowry) in 1963, the first all-Arabic classical operetta.[11] The president Gamal Abd al Nasser was in the opening of the operetta. During the lecture Marianna showed us documents and photos of this event and many other. After having formed the Ballet Academy and the Folkloric Dance Academy, the government approached her about forming a National Folklore troupe (without her). She replied \\"the troupe without me does not exist\\" and refused, remaining independent. As they told her that once the company is nationalized they will give her a pension and she will not be able to work with her company as they will belong to the government. The move to Greece With a change of government in 1964, the tide turned, and the Minister of Culture which had supported Mazloum was now out of favour. The support for Mazloum and her company fell way, and many dancers found their employment with the National Troupe of dancers that was the representative of the Egyptian folkloric dance. The new regime made life for Mazloum very difficult, starting a slander campaign in the press. Determined as always Mazloum never gave up, she packed all her belonging and left Egypt for Greece to start afresh. There, she buried all the tokens of her past career in a series of trunks and concentrated on teaching and propagating the art of dance, founding the Athens International Dance School, where she taught ballet, and modern dance; Mazloum changed her name to Nelly M. Calvo, so that people wouldn't associate her with her past self, she succeeded in her endeavour, and formed many teachers and dancers in Greece. Teaching dance and the MADRI foundation From 1985 to her death in 2003, she restarted teaching Oriental Dance, using her own system and creative technique: the Nelly Mazloum Oriental Dance Technique, which includes her own signature style, called [\\"Hawanem\\"] the dance of high nobility. Mazloum also developed her own system of working out called ‚ÄòVivicorporeal Psychosomatic Alignment Technique‚Äô in support of Oriental Dance; she also started giving a series of seminars throughout Europe, where she was the first to introduce Oriental Dance Technique, Vivicorporeal and Pharaonic Dances. Mazloum favoured the term Oriental Dance which has a positive implication instead of ‚Äòbelly dance‚Äô which carries a negative charge. Mazloum‚Äôs main focus for teaching her method of Oriental Dance is to emphasize the value of Postural Awareness, along with the elaboration and correct performance of steps, musicality and expression; this working method has been an inspiration to many dancers and teachers all over the world. Her structured pedagogical method of teaching and her excellent teaching skills, her patience and her humorous personality, as well as the passion for life made her seminars a great adventure in knowledge to her students; it brought in no time a drastic progress and an improvement in the dance quality of the participants in each seminar. In 1990 she started writing her book ‚ÄúNelly Mazloum Oriental Dance Technique‚Äù a study of Egyptian dance method for the women of the New Age (published in 1992)). In 2001 she founded the Nelly Mazloum Mediterranean Archaic Dance Research Institute (MADRI - co-founded by her daughter Marianna), a non-profit dance organization that stood for the evolution and preservation of ancient Mediterranean Dances as well as the preservation of her techniques. Mazloum wrote in one of her articles ‚ÄúArchaic dance still influence our moving center, for they are rooted in the cosmic memory of our planet. They may disappear into past but always find their way back to us through research work and spiritual identification.‚Äù She also wrote: ‚ÄúI am opposed to false representations and fantasies about oriental dance as well as unwarranted assumption and tampering with teaching this dance, because it stifles progress. A well designed and systematically structured technique has the advantage that you are trained with a firm foundation. Then it‚Äôs time to dream to your heart‚Äôs content and follow the path of creativity and self- discovery.‚Äù According to Mazloum learning steps and technique is not sufficient for a good dancer. She wanted her students to examine their potential and above all, they should love their work, ‚ÄúStudents and teachers must love what they do, with their whole heart, their whole mind and their whole body.‚Äù Nelly Mazloum died on February 21, 2003 in Athens. Her daughter Marianna Roussou Mazloum (also known by her stage name Marhaba) was her foremost student who received continuous first hand instruction from her mother since childhood and always assisted her during the workshops, as well as taught for more than 40 years, offers seminars and lectures ‚Äì backed by accurate documents and rare photos - on Nelly Mazloum‚Äôs life, dance method, legacy and work.

It provides bonuses for workers who perform their jobs effectively, according to easily measurable criteria. In the United States, policy makers are divided on whether merit pay should be offered to public school teachers, and other public employees, as is commonly the case in the United Kingdom. History Merit pay's roots lie in behavioral psychology and incentive theory. These theories are based in the belief that people are rational and react to incentives and that you can increase performance with the correct catalyst. One example of a system that uses merit-pay is the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) created by the Milken Family Foundation in 1999. TAP is currently in place in more than 180 schools all across the United States. In this program, salary raises are based on some aspects of teacher performance, measured by a combination of observations and student test scores. TAP teachers can advance their career in three ways: (1) remain in the classroom and become a mentor to others, (2) leave the classroom and become a master teacher, or (3) advance to administration through traditional means. This program is focused on helping teachers improve performance by learning from others. Teachers are put into small groups that‚Äîfor a few hours each week‚Äîcollaborate about what's working in the classroom. The opportunity allows teachers to build skills that will improve classroom learning. Since adopting TAP in 2001, Bell Street Middle School has doubled the percent of students with advanced scoring in math and reading. The school has also reduced the number of students scoring \\"below basic level of math\\" by 46 percent.Wallis, C., Healy, R., Hylton, H., & Klarreich, K. (2008). How to Make Great Teachers. (Cover story). Time, 171(8), 28‚Äì34. Another benefit of the TAP program for the middle school has been a reduction in teacher turnover from 32 percent to 10 percent.Wallis, C., Healy, R., Hylton, H., & Klarreich, K. (2008). How to Make Great Teachers. (Cover story). Time, 171(8), 28‚Äì34. One criticism of TAP is that it is expensive for schools, costing from $250 to $400 per student per year.TAP Frequently Asked Questions http://tapsystem.org/action/action.taf?page=faq Many TAP schools use grants to fund the program cost. An independent study conducted by Vanderbilt University researchers compared TAP schools' test score gains to non-TAP schools. TAP seems to do better at the elementary school level, but in fact does worse than non-TAP schools in grades 6 through 10. In 2006, the United States Congress created a $600 million federal grant program called the Teacher Incentive Plan (TIF). In 2009, the program was expanded and supported with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the TIF \\"supports efforts to develop and implement performance- based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools.\\" The program's goals include: * (1) improving student achievement by increasing teacher and principal effectiveness * (2) reforming teacher and principal compensation systems so that teachers and principals are rewarded for increases in student achievement * (3) increasing the number of effective teachers teaching poor, minority, and disadvantaged students in hard-to-staff subjects * (4) creating sustainable performance-based compensation systems (PBCSs) A national evaluation of the TIF program has yet to be performed, but preliminary research has provided mixed results. According to an article by the Center for American Progress, an evaluation of programs supported by TIF, such as Denver's ProComp program and the Nashville study (both discussed below), has shown initial evidence that performance-based pay has had a positive effect on student achievement. However, other evaluations, such as a study performed by the Vanderbilt University National Center on Performance Incentives in the metropolitan Nashville School System, have not confirmed the hypothesis that rewarding teachers for improved scores will cause scores to rise.Three-year study finds teacher bonuses fail to improve test scores. By DORIE TURNER, The Associated Press, Southeast Missourian, September 22, 2010Teacher performance pay alone does not raise student test scores, by Melanie Moran, Vanderbilt News, Sep. 21, 2010. Denver's Professional Compensation System for Teachers was approved by teachers and financially backed by Denver voters in 2004 and 2005, and it later received additional funding from a TIF grant in 2006. In this program, teachers are given nine ways to increase their earnings, such as working in a high-needs schools, exceeding expectations on state exams, meeting professional objectives set at the beginning of the year, receiving a worthy evaluation from a principal, and gaining \\"distinguished school\\" status by meeting mixed criteria such as parent satisfaction. In 2010, an evaluation report detailing effects of ProComp was issued. This report highlighted several key findings in both district-wide student achievement trends, as well as in student achievement outcomes relating to teacher hiring effects. On a district-wide level, the 2010 evaluation showed a substantial increase in mathematics and reading achievement from the immediate time period before ProComp's implementation compared to time period subsequent to the implementation. Additionally, teachers hired after the implementation of ProComp showed higher first-year achievement compared to those hired before the program's implementation. The National Center on Performance Incentives conducted a three-year study in the metropolitan Nashville School System from 2006 through 2009, in which middle school mathematics teachers participated in an experiment to evaluate the effect of financial rewards for teachers whose students showed large gains on standardized tests. As stated in the study's final findings report, \\"The experiment was intended to test the notion that rewarding teachers for improved scores would cause scores to rise.\\" The results of the study did not confirm this hypothesis. Students of teachers assigned to the treatment group eligible for bonuses did not outperform students whose teachers were assigned to the control group that was not eligible for bonuses. Effort versus selection Most analyses of merit pay, including the Nashville Study, consider whether or not the existing teachers in a school perform better after being offered pay for performance. Scores might go up if teachers work harder or \\"work better.\\" This situation, often called \\"increased effort,\\" implies that teachers were not working as hard as they might before the performance pay was offered, and the lack of achievement results implies that the performance pay does not lead to increased effort. On the other hand, an additional feature of performance pay might be improved \\"selection\\" of who enters and who stays in teaching. For example, a different group of teachers might be induced to enter the teacher profession if pay was aligned more with performance. And, the best teachers, the ones who get the added performance pay, may on average be induced to stay in the classroom longer. These larger impacts through changes in selection would not show up on the evaluations previously conducted but can show up on overall comparisons of countries that do and do not employ performance pay systems. Ludger Woessmann finds evidence that performance pay does improve performance when viewed across countries.Ludger Woessmann, \\"Cross-country evidence on teacher performance pay.\\" Economics of Education Review 30, no. 3 (June 2011): 404-418. Additionally, the analysis of the impact of dismissing ineffective teachers by Eric Hanushek can be interpreted as a special form of performance pay where pay is reduced to zero (or a very low amount) for teachers who do not perform well.Eric Hanushek, \\"Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?\\" Education Next 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011). Loss aversion and merit pay Loss aversion was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. They proposed the notion that individuals assign value to gains and losses rather than to final assets. In other words, individuals have a tendency to prefer avoiding losses rather than accruing gains. This notion of people hating to lose, more than they like gaining something, even if the potential amount that could be lost is the same as the amount to be gained, has been tested in many arenas. An experiment conducted by Kahneman et al. 1990 Journal of Political Economy describes testing loss aversion through the concepts of the Endowment effect and the Coase Theorem. The endowment effect reveals the notion that people place a higher value on objects they own relative to objects they do not. The Coase theorem focuses on transaction costs and the importance of who owns a particular commodity. They found that randomly assigned owners of a mug required significantly more money to part with their possession (around $7) than randomly assigned buyers were willing to pay to acquire it (around $3). Kahneman attributed this result to loss aversion: owners were affected more by the loss of the mug compared to the effect of a buyer purchasing the mug as a gain. Another experiment conducted by Terrance Odean at Berkeley College examined the account of 10,000 investors at a large discount brokerage house. The tendency of investors revealed they held on to losing investments too long and sold winning investments too soon. Their behavior did not appear to be motivated by rational re-balancing of portfolios or to avoid higher trading costs. According to Odean, these investors held on to these losing stocks in order to prolong the feeling of loss from selling them, even though there was no evidence that by holding onto them, they would rise in value. \\"Winning investments that investors chose to sell continued in subsequent months to outperform the losing stocks investors kept.\\" Benefits # Leads to better educational outcomes. #: Proponents argue that paying teachers according to their effectiveness would be consistent with management precepts from the private sector and would lead to better educational outcomes. Lewis Solmon, President of the TAP and a control group that merit pay contributes toward student achievement. The RAND study concluded that fifty percent of the schools with these reforms outperformed the control schools in math and forty- seven percent outperformed the control in reading.Solmon, Lewis. The Case for Merit Pay. In: Peterson, Paul. ed. Choice and Competition in American Education. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (2006). pg. 110 # Helps low-performing schools attract teachers. #: Schools that use merit pay are better able to attract teachers than schools with no merit pay system. This is especially helpful in enabling schools with lower socioeconomic status attract qualified teachers. For instance, a review of the Teacher Advancement Program in Arizona showed that over a three-year period, 61 teachers started working at the two schools of lowest socioeconomic status in the Madison school district, both of which use the TAP and of these teachers 21% have come from schools in high socioeconomic areas.Solmon, Lewis. The Case for Merit Pay. In: Peterson, Paul. ed. Choice and Competition in American Education. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (2006). pg. 106 # Higher teacher retention rates. #: Merit pay programs can also alleviate the problem of teacher retention. Stronge, Gareis and Little (2006) argue that merit pay or other performance pay programs provide added motivation for teachers in keeping novice teachers from leaving the profession after a few years and especially in retaining experienced teachers.Stronge, J., Gareis, C. & Little, C. Teacher Pay and Teacher Quality: Attracting, Developing and Retaining the Best Teachers. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Books. (2006). pg. 20 # Show the value of a teachers work #: Teachers who actually strive for their students to be better will show under the performance pay. # Teachers will work harder to maintain their incentives #: Higher scores will demonstrate a teacher's ability of going the extra mile. Detractors # Low teacher morale and increased competition between teachers. # Wasted time and money in the administration of the merit pay plans. # Little evidence from research that incentive programs lead to student achievement. :: In 1994 the Urban Institute conducted a study and found some positive short-lived effects of merit pay, but concluded that most merit pay plans \\"did not succeed at implementing lasting, effective ... plans that had a demonstrated ability to improve student learning.\\" Problems included low teacher morale because of increased competition between teachers, as well as wasted time and money in the administration of the merit pay plans. The same study found \\"little evidence from other research...that incentive programs (particularly pay-for- performance) had led to improved teacher performance and student achievements.\\" :: Marie Gryphon, an education policy analyst at the Cato Institute, makes some practical objections: ::*The system can't simply reward high scores. If it did, it would favor teachers in wealthy neighborhoods whose students came to school with excellent skills. Nor can the system reward only improvement. If it did, it would unfairly penalize teachers whose students were already scoring too well to post large gains. ::*Moreover, any money for test results scheme will worsen the problem of teachers cheating on standardized tests to avoid the consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act. Teachers willing to erase wrong answers on exams to avoid having their school labeled \\"needing improvement\\" will also be tempted by the thought of a personal raise. # Teachers may not feel the need to help one another and may feel they have to compete with one another. # Merit pay may lead educators to become dishonest in order to receive the higher pay of higher test scores. Political opinions and implementation history =Teacher merit pay= Some political figures support the merit-pay system as an effective policy for enhancing educational quality. Political reactions Jeb Bush, governor of Florida during that time, enacted a 5 percent bonus for the top 25 percent of teachers in the state of Florida. A large factor in selection of the top 25 percent of teachers was student score improvement. A similar program was implemented in Houston at the same time, only lacking a limit on the percentage of teachers who could receive the bonus. Teachers in both states rebelled, stating that a year of instruction can't be measured in a single test, on a single day. These systems showed other imperfections as well. For example, a county in Florida ran out of money before all the teachers received bonuses. Accusations of discrimination also existed, a result of difference in pay between predominately black and predominately white schools. President Barack Obama does support merit pay for teachers. He believes teachers' pay should be increased based on performance tests, not arbitrary tests. He wishes to work with the National Education Association (NEA) to find a new system to get rid of performance pay. The National Education Association (NEA) adamantly opposes some forms of merit pay. In June 2003 NEA President Reg Weaver said: > Teachers understand that politically motivated panaceas such as merit pay > and eliminating tenure do nothing to improve teacher quality. Our members > are open to alternatives, but we will always oppose quick fixes designed to > weaken the voice of teachers and effectiveness of education employees in all > jobs. In September 2011, President Obama took steps to reform certain unpopular and ineffective provisions of No Child Left Behind, stating, \\"Congress hasn't been able to do it, so I will. The most notable change to the law related to the 2014 deadline for all schools to bring their entire student body to \\"proficient\\" levels in reading and math. The Obama administration offered a pass on the deadline and the opportunity to design their own accountability systems to some schools. The provisions that required failing schools to offer after-school tutoring and no-cost bus transportation to better schools were also waived. In order to qualify for these waivers, however, states must demonstrate an adoption of \\"college and career ready\\" academic standards and deliver a sketch of how they plan to transform their lowest performing schools. States that apply for these waivers this fall can be reviewed by the Education Department early next year. According to Eugene Wilhoit, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, likely candidates for early application include Georgia, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Colorado. Wilhoit believes that other states will also apply for the waiver after watching the process unfold for the states that apply early. Still, other states are not likely to apply at all, unwilling to disrupt current accountability systems when No Child Left Behind could soon be overhauled by Congress. =Federal government merit pay= Clinton and Gore In early 1993, incoming President Bill Clinton‚Äîinheriting a federal government mired in recession and record debt‚Äîassigned his Vice President, Al Gore, to form a National Performance Review (NPR) panel to undertake a \\"Reinventing Government\\" initiative \\"to create a government that 'works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about.'\\"Kamensky, John \\"National Partnership for Reinventing Government (formerly the National Performance Review): A Brief History\\", January 1999, National Partnership for Reinventing Government, Washington, DC, as retrieved June 6, 2014, as retrieved June 6, 2014 In 1993, with Executive Order 12862, the President called for a revolution in government's customer service to deliver services equal to the best in business.Clinton, Bill, President & Vice President Al Gore, \\"The Blair House Papers\\", National Performance Review (NPR), January 1997, Blair House, Washington, DC, as retrieved June 6, 2014 Working with David Osborne (noted co-author of the popular book Reinventing Government) and leaders in government, business and organizational development, the committee made numerous recommendations, and developed implementation schemes for them. Among those was \\"III. Reinvent To Get The Job Done With Less - 9. Create Performance-Based Organizations (PBOs).\\" The NPR's \\"Blair House Papers\\" explained that: > Performance-Based Organizations (PBOs) are discrete management units that > commit to clear objectives, specific measurable goals, customer service > standards, and targets for improved performance.

Thus began the modern movement towards merit-based pay in U.S. federal civil service. However, the NPR was clear that not all functions of government were suited to such performance-rewarded incentives: > In a PBO, the policy-making and regulatory functions are split from their > program operations. The PBO focuses on programmatic operations. Not all > government agencies are suited to become PBOs. Operations that do not have > clear, measurable results should be excluded.

Subsequent efforts of the NPR (by 1999 renamed the \\"National Partnership for Reinventing Government\\") led to additional efforts to identify and apply effective and suitable ways to reward federal employee performance. Bush In 2004, Pres. George W. Bush and other Republicans favored shifting federal civilian employee salary pay raises from across-the-board uniform raises towards a merit-based pay system‚Äîparticularly through a proposed system called the \\"...Human Capital Performance Fund, which agencies can use to reward their highest performing employees,...\\" according to a March, 2004 letter to Congress from the Bush administration's Director of the Office of Management & Budget (OMB), Joshua Bolten. The Bush Budget Director's letter goes on to say: > The President's pay proposal provides sufficient pay not only to recruit and > retain needed workers, but also to reward the government‚Äôs highest > performing employees. The Administration is implementing better agency > performance appraisal systems that will be able to distinguish superior > performance.

Barack Obama, and both parties in Congress, found difficulty in managing federal employee compensation. Despite an official pay freeze, federal employee compensation continued to rise‚Äîowing in part to the merit pay (\\"pay-for-performance\\" or \\"employee bonus\\") system, but also due to promotions and to automatic scheduled increases in \\"completing waiting periods used in grade- and step-type pay systems.\\" Chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, Rep.

She saw action in the Korean War. She was named for the Cayuga nation, a First Nations people of Canada. Construction and career Cayuga was ordered in April 1942 as part of the 1942 building programme. She was laid down on 7 October 1943 by Halifax Shipyards at Halifax, Nova Scotia and launched 28 July 1945.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 240 Cayuga was commissioned on 20 October 1947 at Halifax with the pennant number R04. On 4 February 1948, Cayuga transferred to the west coast for Esquimalt, British Columbia. In October 1948, Cayuga joined the cruiser , destroyers , and the frigate in sailing to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; the largest deployment of the Royal Canadian Navy following the war. In March 1950, with Ontario and , the destroyer participated in a training cruise to Mexico, making several port visits. =Korean War= Cayuga served a total of three tours of Korea, the last in 1954 after the conflict had ended. Cayuga was part of this initial first dispatch of three ships by Canada to Korea, departing Esquimalt on 5 July 1950. In 1952, Cayuga was reconstructed as a destroyer escort and given the new hull number 218. It was on this vessel that Ferdinand Demara, \\"the great impostor\\", served while impersonating a Canadian medical officer. After the Korean War, Cayuga served as a training ship on the west coast. On 1 January 1955, Cayuga was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron. The initial commanding officer of the group was Commander Henry H. Davidson, captain of Cayuga. In November 1955, the Second Canadian Escort Squadron was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California. In January 1959 she transferred back to Halifax. There the destroyer escort served as a training ship until being paid off on 27 February 1964. The destroyer was sold for scrap and broken up at Faslane, Scotland in 1965. RCSCC Cayuga In 1954 the 30th Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps, RCSCC Exeter, was renamed after HMCS Cayuga and renumbered 140, and continues to operate to this day, on CFB Wainwright, Alberta. RCSCC Cayuga is approximately 25 strong. The corps shares the same motto and badge as its namesake.

She was the first ship to bear this name, entering service in 1943. She was named for the Huron people. During the Second World War the vessel saw service in Operation Neptune in the Bay of Biscay and along the French coast in support of the invasion of Normandy and escorted convoys to the Soviet Union. Following the war, the ship was placed in reserve. The destroyer was activated in 1950 as a training ship, but with the onset of the Korean War, was modernized and deployed twice to Korea. Following the war, Huron reverted to a training ship and took part in Cold War-era North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) naval exercises until being paid off for the final time in 1963 and broken up for scrap in 1965. Design and description The Tribals were designed to fight heavily armed destroyers of other navies, such as the Japanese .Chesneau, p. 40 Canada chose the design based on its armament, with the size and power of the Tribal class allowing them to act more like small cruisers than as fleet destroyers.Tucker, p. 26 Huron was among the first batch of Tribal-class destroyers ordered by the Royal Canadian Navy in 1940‚Äì1941. They were ordered with modified ventilation and heating systems for North Atlantic winter service. Design modifications were made after deficiencies were noted in , the lead ship of the Canadian Tribals. Canadian Tribals were a foot longer than their British counterparts and carried an auxiliary boiler for heating and additional power requirements.Friedman, pp. 53‚Äì55 Huron, as one of the British-built Tribal- class destroyers, was long between perpendiculars and long overall with a beam of and a draught of . As built, the destroyer had a standard displacement of and at deep load.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 59 Huron had a complement of 14 officers and 245 ratings. The destroyer was propelled by two shafts driven by two Parsons geared turbines powered by steam created by three Admiralty-type three drum boilers. This created and gave the ship a maximum speed of . The destroyers could carry of fuel oil. As built, Huron was fitted with six quick firing Mk XII guns placed in three twin turrets, designated 'A', 'B' and 'Y' from bow to stern.Mark XII = Mark 12. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after the Second World War. The turrets were placed on 40¬∞ mountings with open-backed shields. The ship also had one twin turret of QF Mk XVI guns in the 'X' position. For secondary anti-aircraft armament, the destroyer was equipped with one quad mount 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" gun and six single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The vessel was also fitted with four torpedo tubes for Mk IX torpedoes.Friedman, p. 55 The ship was equipped with Type 291 radar for air search, Type 293 radar for target indication and Type 285 radar for 4.7-inch gun control and a DCT controller for the 4-inch guns (working with the Type 285 radar). The radar was carried on a lattice mast and the HF/DF was situated on a pole aft.Friedman, pp. 52‚Äì53 Construction and career Huron was ordered on 5 April 1940 as part of the 1940 shipbuilding programme. However, due to the increased workload on British shipyards due to losses on the continent, her keel-laying was delayed. She was laid down on 15 July 1941 by Vickers-Armstrongs on the River Tyne in England and launched on 25 June 1942. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 19 July 1943 at Newcastle upon Tyne.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 61. She was completed on 28 July. =Russian convoys= After commissioning, Huron was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the British Home Fleet. From 1‚Äì11 October 1943 she carried special supplies and personnel to Murmansk in the Soviet Union as part of Operation Holder.Rohwer, p. 279. On her return to Scapa Flow she was damaged in a collision with an oiler and spent a month in repair at Leith. After her return from the dockyard she then spent the rest of the year escorting convoys bound for the Soviet Union. She made six escort trips on the Murmansk Run. The first, convoy JW 54A sailed from Loch Ewe on 15 November and Huron joined the escort from 18‚Äì24 November. On 28 November, the destroyer was among the escort of convoy RA 54B returning from the Soviet Union and arriving at Loch Ewe on 9 December. Both convoys arrived without loss. Huron was escorting her next convoy, Convoy JW 55B, when it came under attack by German Junkers Ju 88 bombers on 22 December. The convoy escaped unscathed.Rohwer, pp. 286, 292‚Äì93. Huron and was present at the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943, for the sinking of the , and observed the Royal Norwegian Navy destroyer advance to within and fire torpedoes at the much larger Scharnhorst. The convoy arrived without loss and Huron escorted the return convoy, also without loss. On the next convoy escort mission, Convoy JW 56B, the convoy came under attack during the night of 25/26 January. Three merchant vessels were sunk and the British destroyer damaged.Rohwer, pp. 293, 300. =Operations along the French coast= Huron continued to escort Arctic convoys until February 1944, when she was transferred to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla based at Plymouth to take part in the lead up to the invasion of Normandy. Two operations were run by Plymouth Command in preparation. The first, Operation Tunnel, were patrols against German convoys in the Bay of Biscay and English Channel. In Operation Hostile, the second, the destroyers and cruisers covered minelayers laying minefields in enemy waters. By late April 1944, Huron had carried out eleven Hostile and Tunnel missions. The time between missions was spent training in night-fighting, radar-controlled gunnery, and radar detection.Schull, pp. 250‚Äì51. On 25 April 1944, Huron, along with several other destroyers, encountered three torpedo boats of the German 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla while performing an Operation Tunnel mission. The result of the engagement saw the Canadian destroyers sink and severely damage the others.Gimblett, pp. 68, 75.Rohwer, p. 318. Huron was damaged in the action, colliding with . This was followed by several more Tunnel and Hostile missions in May 1944, with no encounters with Germans.Schull, pp. 252, 258. At the end of May, the 10th Destroyer Flotilla was assigned to the Hurd Deep Patrol, maintaining a patrol line to intercept German surface craft still based at Brest, Cherbourg, and ports in the Bay of Biscay. On D-day, Huron was performing a Hurd Deep patrol, returning to Plymouth that afternoon. Within an hour of their arrival, German naval movement was detected, and the following day Huron and sister ship sailed to relieve destroyers already on patrol. On 9 June 1944, as a result of Ultra intercepts, Huron and several other destroyers intercepted a force of German destroyers heading for the Allied invasion fleet in what became known as the Battle of Ushant, off the coast of Brittany. After a fierce gun battle, she assisted Haida in running aground and pummeling the wreck.Zuehlke, pp. 218‚Äì225.Schull, pp. 258, 288‚Äì295. Later that month, on 27 and 28 June 1944, while on patrol with fellow Tribal-class destroyer , they intercepted a German detachment composed of a heavily armed minesweeper and two naval trawlers. After the destroyers were detected, the Germans attempted to get in closer to shore under the protection of their coastal artillery. Huron sank the minesweeper and a trawler. However, the second trawler severely damaged Eskimo, knocking that destroyer out of action.Schull, pp. 339‚Äì40.Rohwer on page 336 claims the force was a converted trawler M 4611 and one patrol boat V 213. M 4611 was sunk and V 213 was the ship that damaged Eskimo and escaped. On 8 July 1944, Huron and attacked two naval trawlers before being driven off by coastal artillery.Schull, p. 340. Rohwer states that Huron and Tartar attacked the German 4th Minesweeping Flotilla off the Channel Islands during the night of 7/8 July. The two destroyers combined to sink two of the minesweepers, M 4605 and M 4601.Rohwer, p. 341. Plymouth Command ran a final operation in support of the Normandy landings, Operation Kinetic, which was designed to break up German coastal supply. On 31 July 1944, the 10th Destroyer Flotilla sailed from Plymouth and returned on 3 August. They sailed again the next day on what was to be Hurons final patrol before departing for Canada.Schull, p. 348. =Refit and end of war= In August 1944, Huron returned to Canada to undergo a refit at Halifax, Nova Scotia. She returned to UK waters in November 1944, carrying out escort duties in the Western Approaches. In March 1945, she was transferred to the Home Fleet for screening duties, traveling from Scapa Flow and the River Clyde. On 16 April 1945, Huron sailed for Murmansk on one final Arctic convoy to the Soviet Union, returning to Scapa Flow on 6 May 1945.Schull, pp. 401, 406 On the return convoy to Scapa Flow, the last convoy battle of the European war takes place. The convoy is attacked by German U-boats, with one member of the escort, being sunk.Rohwer, p. 412. Huron, Haida and the cruiser departed Scapa Flow for Trondheim, Norway, calling in fjords with relief supplies. Upon reaching Trondheim, the Allied units take over custody of surrendered U-boats. Huron returned to Greenock, Scotland on 24 April 1945.Rohwer, p. 416. In May 1945 she returned to Canada. She began a tropicalization refit to prepare her for possible service in the southern Pacific Ocean. However, this was cancelled due to the surrender of Japan. Following the end of the war, she was decommissioned into the reserve on 9 March 1946. =Postwar service= In 1950, Huron was recommissioned with the new pennant number 216 for training purposes, but with the onset of the Korean War she was sent overseas. She sailed for her first tour in Korean waters on 22 January 1951. She arrived in theatre on 15 March 1951 and in early April, Huron and sister ship screened aircraft carriers on the east coast of Korea while they performed airstrikes on Wonsan. In May, Huron transferred to the west coast, screening carriers and performing inshore patrols. During one of her patrols, the destroyer captured a large Chinese junk and its eight crew. In late June, the destroyer switched to the east coast, screening carriers and performing shore bombardment and inshore patrol missions. Huron screened the aircraft carriers and during airstrikes on North Korea, which became known as the \\"Han River Demonstration\\" during truce talks in July. Huron left for Canada on 14 August, relieved by Athabaskan.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 49‚Äì50, 55, 59‚Äì60. Upon her return to Canada on 21 September 1951, Huron underwent a major refit, completing in 1953.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 141. The refit changed her armament, replacing the 'Y' gun mount with a double Squid anti-submarine mortar mount. Hurons main guns became uniform, with the 4.7-inch guns replaced with 4-inch guns. This was later changed to the guns in mounts 'A' and 'B' remaining as 4-inch guns, but the 'X' mount became a twin /50 calibre mount. The anti- aircraft armament was upgraded as well, with four single 40 mm Bofors guns. The DCT was upgraded to a US Mark 63 fire control system and the radars to SPS-6 air search and Sperry surface search models.Friedman, p. 394 Her second tour of duty as a member of the Commonwealth Task Force lasted from 18 June 1953 until 5 February 1954. The latter part of that tour was spent during the Armistice period. Her third tour from 1 October to 26 December 1954 was spent with the United Nations fleet monitoring Korean waters. Following her Korean tours she reverted to her training role, taking part in NATO activities until she was paid off into reserve at Halifax on 20 April 1963 and scrapped at La Spezia, Italy in August 1965.

Anchor Steve Paikin states that the show practices long-form journalism. Each hour- long program covers no more than two topics. The show airs weekdays on TVO at 8 and 11 pm, and episodes are available on demand at the show website and through mobile media. History The program's creation was announced as part of programming and re-structuring changes at TVO on 29 June 2006. It replaced Studio 2, a current affairs program that was hosted by Paikin and Paula Todd; it also subsumed Paikin's Fourth Reading, which continued for a number of years as a weekly panel discussion segment on The Agenda.Jim Coyle, \\"Legislature fades from media radar\\". Toronto Star, September 15, 2008. In 2012, TVO restructured its program lineup, terminating the programs Allan Gregg in Conversation and Big Ideas. Some lectures that would have been broadcast via Big Ideas were instead covered by the Agenda. The network also devoted more resources to expanding the program \\"as a multi-platform hub for civic engagement in the big issues of the day\\". Journalist Nam Kiwanuka is the program's primary substitute anchor when Paikin is absent, and is the full- time host of the program during the summer months when the show is branded as The Agenda in the Summer. Program Shows broadcast on Thursday are called Your Agenda, during which viewers can participate in online chats or offer their opinions to producers via Twitter. In 2010, The Agenda introduced a weekly five-minute \\"essay\\" by various personalities at the start of every Thursday show. On the last Thursday of each month, The Agenda with Steve Paikin broadcasts live from the University of Toronto Munk Centre for International Studies, and focuses on world issues. Paikin takes questions from the live audience during the broadcast. Viewers may ask questions to the program's guests in a post-program online chat. In 2008‚Äì09, The Agenda broadcast live in front of audiences from communities throughout Ontario, a feature called On the Road focusing on that community's economy. Each stop of the tour included an AgendaCamp, a community forum held the day before the live regional broadcast. The show took to the road again in 2010 to ask people in the southwestern, eastern and northern regions of Ontario to contribute ideas on the most important issues facing the province and specifically their region in the new economy. In October 2009, the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo hosted the world‚Äôs top scientists at the Quantum to Cosmos (Q2C) Festival.

Old Castle of Lieto () is a site of a hillfort in Lieto, Finland. It rises 55 meters above the sea level. The original name of the castle is not known. According to excavations, the castle has been in use three times during its history, in the Late Bronze Age (1100‚Äì500 BCE) and in Middle Iron Age (500‚Äì700 CE). The third phase of the site between years 1000-1370 can be divided into two. According to the excavations the years 1000-1150 are marked with German money and prehistoric artefacts and the years 1200-1370 with Scandinavian bracteates and medieval artefacts. The hillfort was used by the local Finns proper population until 1170, when it was conquered most likely by the Swedes who possibly used it as a stronghold against Tavastians. View from the Old castle of Lieto, Finland, in August 2007. View to the south from the castle rock. On the left the H√§meen h√§rk√§tie. On the right the Aura River. The steep hillside supported by fortifications on top of the hill provided a good defensive position. Constructions on the hillfort were mostly made of wood. In the latest phase bricks were used as well. Remains of 11 buildings have been found from the top of the hillfort. Earliest defensive structures have been dated to 500 BCE and an outer bailey was in use in the Middle Ages. Total of 14 arrowheads and 150 crossbow bolt heads have been found from the area as well as several spear heads which the oldest has been dated to 6th century. Also several traces of fire have been found from the hillfort. Earliest traces of fire have been dated to Migration Period and the latest to 1360\`s. The castle was located between two ancient transport routes: Aura river and H√§meen h√§rk√§tie leading to central Tavastia. Its importance decreased when the Turku castle was finished in beginning of the 14th century. Hence the name Old Castle of Lieto.

With a length of 98 km, it is the longer headstream of the West Morava (the name it takes at its confluence with the ƒêetinja), and thus, of the Great Morava. Its name, Moravica, means \\"little Morava\\" in Serbian, and it also gives its name to the surrounding region and the modern Moravica District of Serbia.  Stari Vlah  The Golijska Moravica originates from the western slopes of the Golija mountain and flows straight to the north, between the Golija and Javor mountains, through the Stari Vlah region. Even though the area in the lower course is sparsely populated, there are many hamlets on the river, characteristically organized in clusters. More important are the villages of Sakoviƒái, Gazdoviƒái, Kumanica, Meƒëureƒçje (where it receives the No≈°nica from the left) and ƒåitluk.  Ivanjica depression  The Golijska Morava enters the Ivanjica depression, located between the mountains of ƒåemerno on the east, and Muƒçanj on the west. This is where it receives the Luƒçka reka from the right and Graboviƒçka reka from the left and flows through the town of Ivanjica, its suburbs of Bedina Varo≈° and ≈†ume, the satellite earth station of Prilike and the village of Dubrava. At the end of the depression, the Golijska Moravica passes next to the monastery of Sveti Arhanƒëeli, as it continues to the north.  Arilje depression & Ta≈°ti field  From Ivanjica depression, the Golijska Moravica flows into the Arilje depression, located between the mountains of Golubac (on the east) and Blagaja (on the west), where it receives the Tre≈°njevica from the right (at the village of Divljaka), and its major tributary, the Rzav from the right, near the town of Arilje, which itself used to be called Moravica in medieval period. In the final section, the Golijska Morava reaches the Ta≈°ti field, located between the mountains of Blagaja, Krstac and Crnokosa, east of the town of Po≈æega. Near the village of Pilatoviƒái, the Golijska Morava meets the ƒêetinja and together they form the Zapadna Morava, longer headwater of the Velika Morava. The Golijska Moravica drains an area of 1,513 km¬≤, belongs to the Black Sea drainage area and it is not navigable. The river's potential for power production is not used.

Micmac was the first modern, high-performance warship built in Canada. She was the first of four Tribal destroyers built at the Halifax Shipyard and one of eight Tribal-class destroyers to serve in the Royal Canadian Navy. Background Micmac was one of 27 Tribal-class destroyers completed for the Royal Navy (RN), the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and the Royal Canadian Navy. She was the lead ship of the Canadian wartime Tribal Destroyer program, followed by sister ships , and . Ordered in early 1941 she did not commission until late 1945, after the end of hostilities. Micmacs construction, taking 57 months from the date of order to the date of commission; about twice that of Tribals built elsewhere. For example Micmacs Australian-built sister, ‚Äîordered by the RAN in September 1939, laid down on 10 February 1940, launched on 7 February 1942, and commissioned on 23 November 1942‚Äîtook but 29 months while the twenty Tribals constructed for the RN (16) and RCN (4) in British yards averaged but 26 months from the date of order to the date of commission. Micmacs delay was due to economic and political issues that permeated the entire Canadian Destroyer Project. =Economic issues= Economically, Canada's overall limited industrial capacity was a major factor. Tribal class fleet destroyers hull construction required a high-tensile (HT) specialty steel that was neither made in Canada nor available for purchase from the United States. Steel which Great Britain, overtaxed by the growing demands of a general European war, could not provide and that Canadian mills proved slow to produce. The hulls of low performance corvettes and frigates, designed to merchant ship standards and powered by triple expansion steam engines, could be built from the mild steel readily available from Canadian sources. However, high performance warships, like destroyers, require hulls built as light as practical to obtain the maximum speed possible from the available power plant whilst still carrying a useful armament. A strong yet lightweight hull requires high-strength steel and such speciality steel of the exact specification required for a Tribal hull simply was not to be had from North American sources when Micmac was ordered. The propulsion plant required for a Tribal was also unavailable from Britain. And the Canadian order for Micmacs machinery was a first in class effort for the designated manufacturer. Turbine engines of the size and complexity required by the Tribals never before had been built in Canada. Further, at the time Micmacs engines were ordered, the primary contractor, John Inglis and Company, was itself in considerable administrative difficulty arising from the increased demands of wartime procurement. The serious impact of this situation may be grasped when one considers that Micmacs hull was completed in Halifax after 32 months but the ship had to wait another full year for the delivery of her machinery from Inglis in Toronto before her fitting out could commence. =Civil political issues= The selection of Halifax Shipyard for the construction of the first Canadian-made Tribal destroyer was made by Canada's Minister of Defence for Naval Services, Angus L. Macdonald. MacDonald was both a Nova Scotia native and a former Premier of that province, an office he would re-occupy after the war's end until his death in 1954, a political connection that did not go unnoticed. Building a high performance warship is a complex undertaking that all too often strains the capabilities of experienced shipbuilders. Even when all the requisite materials and technical facilities are readily available difficulties abound. While Canada had few such enterprises in 1941, some did exist, notably the larger and more experienced Vickers yards in Montreal. However a smaller and less equipped shipyard, Halifax Shipyards Limited, was selected for the Canadian Tribal program that began with Micmac. At the outbreak of war in 1939 Halifax Shipyard, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was distant from the major industrial centre of Canada. The city had a modest population and an even more modest industrial capacity. Further, from 1940 until the end of the war the limited, albeit increasing, technical facilities and skilled labour force available to Halifax Shipyard were necessarily concentrated upon repair and refit of ships damaged in innumerable Atlantic convoys departing from Bedford Basin. Thus, competition for such limited resources as were available was intense. Halifax, between 1940 and 1945, was one of the busiest and most congested ports in the world and the Halifax Shipyard was already working at capacity handling repair work for Atlantic convoy ships damaged in transit. While no shipyard in Canada had ever constructed a ship that even approached the complexity of a modern destroyer, Halifax Shipyard had limited experience even by Canadian standards. While the Halifax Shipyard had built four large freighters at the end of the First World War as well as an advanced icebreaker, Micmacs yard number, hull No. 12, indicates just how few hulls the yard had constructed. However the selection of the Halifax yard also had several advantages. While Halifax Shipyards had not produced a large number of ships, it had produced some advanced and successful vessels. Two of its 1920 refrigerated freighters, SS Canadian Cruiser and were very large by Canadian standards, and remained the largest Canadian steel ships built until the end of the war.At 7,178 Gross tons, they were not exceeded in size until the enlarged Park Ship/Navy Repair ships were built at North Vancouver Ship Repair in 1945-46, Tim Colton, \\"North Vancouver Ship Repair\\" and \\"Halifax Shipyards\\", Canadian Shipbuilding History: Construction records of U.S. and Canadian shipbuilders and boatbuilders The icebreaker built by the yard, CGS N.B. McLean was a powerful and long-serving ship as well as one of the largest icebreakers in the word when constructed. The Halifax yard also benefited from the proximity of naval staff at the RCN's Halifax Naval Dockyard adjoining just to the south of the Halifax Shipyard. Finally, an important consideration for the wartime operation of the crucial convoy port of Halifax was the destroyer program's retention of a skilled workforce which helped stabilize the repair capacity of the port. Demand for skilled shipyard works soared in the winter but fell off in the summer causing many workers to leave. The destroyer program kept a large year round workforce available that could be switch from repair to new ship construction as needed., =Service politics= The selection of the extremely advanced Tribal design for domestic construction was specifically that of the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral P.W. Nelles who was influenced by institutional considerations for the future of the RCN. It is recalled that the RCN was only established in 1910 and then primarily as a ploy by Laurier's Liberal administration to avoid paying for British dreadnoughts.See Naval Service Act. Following the First World War, the RCN was progressively reduced in strength until by 1922 its very survival as an independent service was placed at risk.See Royal Canadian Navy during the Interwar period. This experience had some influence on members of the Naval Staff who were determined to forestall any possible re-occurrence at the end of the Second World War. Nelles' evident design was to employ the funding opportunities afforded by the conflict in Europe to establish the post-war RCN as a major, and therefore permanent, part of Canada's defence strategy. Obtaining the necessary infrastructure to support a 'big ship' fleet and the technical know-how to do so in the vicinity of the Navy's home port of Halifax was crucial to that endeavour. Such was the incongruity of the policy choices made with respect to the Canadian Tribal program that it appeared to some contemporary observers, both in and out of the RCN, that while obtaining the means to build a destroyer was claimed vital for the war effort, the actual construction of a destroyer evidently was somewhat less so. Construction and career Micmac was launched on 18 September 1943, named in honour of the Mi'kmaq people of the Maritime provinces, continuing the tradition of naming Canadian Tribal-class destroyers after Canadian First Nations. After many difficulties, especially the delayed arrival of the propulsion system from Inglis in Toronto, Micmac was commissioned on 18 September 1945, captained by Lieutenant Commander R.L. Hennessy, DSC, RCN. All further details respecting commanding officers of HMCS Micmac are taken from this source. Although the war she was intended for had ended the previous May, Micmac was nonetheless the very first destroyer ever constructed in Canada. At an estimated cost of $8,500,000.00 CAD, roughly four times what it cost the RN to build a Tribal, she was also the single most expensive piece of military or naval equipment produced in Canada up to that time. Commissioned into a rapidly shrinking navy, the crew of the brand new destroyer completed her workups and the ship entered into the routine existence of a peacetime navy while dozens of older RCN ships were paid off into reserve or to disposal. Her surviving tribal sisters in the Royal Navy were themselves all paid off to disposal in 1945 and scrapped by 1949 but Canada and Australia would find new uses for Tribal destroyers as Cold War naval confrontations emerged. =Collision= In March 1947, Micmac received a new commanding officer, LCdr. J. C. Littler, RCN, (Cdr. from 1-7-47) and entered a yard period at HMC Dockyard Halifax to refit and upgrade her automatic weapons. Early in the morning of 16 July 1947, Micmac embarked a number of civilian contractors and proceeded to sea from Halifax to conduct full-power trials off Sambro Head. Shortly after the trials completed, just before 13:00 hrs, HMCS Micmac was in collision with the Victory ship (ex-Fort Astoria). Although damage to the Yarmouth County was slight and none of her crew were injured, Micmac suffered 15 injured and five dead. Five more crewmen, together with a civilian dock worker, were also lost at sea and presumed dead. Micmacs upper works, forward of the bridge, were extensively damaged. 'A' mount together with its guns was completely destroyed. Moreover, she lost 40 feet of bow, her hull was badly deformed on the port side, and her keel was broken just under 'B' mount. Although the collision was later blamed on navigational errors, the incident led Montreal newspapers to point fingers at the wartime shipbuilding program. Despite the damage, it was decided to take Micmac in hand for reconstruction as a destroyer escort along with her six surviving sisters. After extensive, albeit temporary, repairs and partial conversion, Micmac recommissioned on 16 November 1949, LCdr. F. C. Frewer, RCN, commanding. However, Micmacs interim repairs did not extend to her broken keel; a state which compromised her structural integrity. Because of this her forward hull could not withstand the deck thrust produced by the recoil of the four 4\\"/45 HA guns that were planned for her DDE conversion. In consequence Micmac was instead fitted with a single Squid Mk IV triple barrel ASW mortar in the 'A' mount position and a single 40mm Bofors quad mount in the 'B' mount position. All her 4.7\\" guns were removed and a twin 4\\"/45 HA mount was shipped in Y position. This configuration gave Micmac a distinctive, if decidedly odd- looking, profile. =DDE conversion= On 30 November 1951 Micmac again paid off, this time to complete her conversion to the new DDE Tribal configuration. During this conversion her broken keel was finally made good and the forward armament was returned to a conventional arrangement of four 4\\"/45 HA guns in two twin mounts. Micmac recommissioned as DDE 214 on 14 August 1953, Cdr. G. M. Wadds, RCN, commanding, but did not complete her workups until September of the following year. Because of her hull damage and prolonged refit Micmac was not considered for operations in the Korean War. As she was completed too late to see service in WWII and was unavailable for deployment at the time of the Korean War, Micmac has the distinction of being the only one of the 27 members of her class never to fire a shot in anger. Instead, her service years were spent as a training ship and sometime guard ship to the aircraft carrier . In common with the rest of her class, Micmac did not age well. Originally designed to counter enlarged French, German, and Italian inter-war destroyer classes‚Äîtherefore intended primarily for service in the relatively sheltered waters of the Mediterranean and North Seas‚Äîthe remarkably heavy armament and very high speed of the Tribal class were purchased at the cost of extremely light hull construction. The transverse strength design of the class, coupled with light hull plating, therefore lacked sufficient longitudinal stability and proved far too flexible and weak in North Atlantic service. In the absence of longitudinal strength members the increased strength of high tensile steel plate could not entirely compensate for its simple lack of mass. Consequently, ships of this class proved particularly susceptible to structural damage when operating at speed. They also frequently suffered machinery casualties due to excessive hull flexure in heavy seas.See notes to entry for November 1939. Gordon Smith, ed., HMS GURKHA (i) (L 20) - Tribal-class Destroyer including Convoy Escort Movements Retirement Hull cracks, feed water and fuel tank leaks, structural failures and turbine damage were a commonplace in Tribals even when they were new. Successive ship alterations which addressed these issues with stiffener plates, frames, stringers, braces and even turbine blade redesign had limited success. Likely it was this consideration which influenced the RN's decision to dispose of their four surviving Tribal destroyers before 1950 even though none of those ships were then more than 12 years old. As the years passed all of Canada's Tribals, both British and Canadian built, developed more frequent and more extensive structural defects necessitating increasingly long yard time for repairs and restrictions placed on their employment. Eventually, the growing cost of their maintenance and their demands on the Navy's restricted manpower no longer could be justified by their decreased capabilities. Thus, in late 1963 the RCN decided to retire the entire class. Micmac finally paid off to disposal in March 1964 along with her sisters. She was sold and in 1965 went to the ship breakers at Faslane, Scotland. The original Micmacs ship's bell is installed on the mast of HMCS Acadia Sea Cadet training centre at the Cornwallis Park training facility near Digby, Nova Scotia. was the gunnery training ship assigned to from 1944 to the end of hostilities. (By coincidence, HMCS Acadia had been commanded by the same LCdr. Littler who captained Micmac at the time of her collision.) In the 1970s the name Micmac was allocated to the Sea Cadet Summer Training Centre located on the lower section of CFB Shearwater. Of the five General Training divisions at HMCS Acadia, one is named Micmac. All of the RCN Tribal-class ship's names have at various times been assigned to training divisions of officer cadets at the former Royal Roads Military College. One Canadian Tribal-class destroyer, the British-built , survives as a museum ship docked in Hamilton, Ontario.

She was named for the Iroquois First Nations. Iroquois was the first ship to bear this name and the first ship of the class to serve with the Royal Canadian Navy.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 62 Design and description The Tribals were designed to fight heavily armed destroyers of other navies, such as the Japanese .Chesneau, p. 40 Canada chose the design based on its armament, with the size and power of the Tribal class allowing them to act more like small cruisers than as fleet destroyers.Tucker, p. 26 Iroquois was among the first batch of Tribal-class destroyers ordered by the RCN in 1940‚Äì1941. They were ordered with modified ventilation and heating systems for North Atlantic winter service. Design modifications were made after deficiencies were noted in Iroquois, the lead ship of the Canadian Tribals. Iroquois, as one of the British-built Tribal- class destroyers, was long between perpendiculars and long overall with a beam of and a draught of . As built, the destroyer displaced standard and at deep load.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 59 Iroquois had a complement of 14 officers and 245 ratings. The destroyer was propelled by two shafts driven by two Parsons geared turbines powered by steam created by three Admiralty-type three drum boilers. This created and gave the ship a maximum speed of . The destroyers could carry of fuel oil. As built, Iroquois was fitted with six quick firing Mk XII guns placed in three twin turrets, designated 'A', 'B' and 'Y' from bow to stern.Mark XII = Mark 12. Britain used Roman numerals to denote Marks (models) of ordnance until after World War II. The turrets were placed on 40¬∞ mountings with open-backed shields. The ship also had one twin turret of QF Mk XVI guns in the 'X' position. For secondary anti-aircraft armament, the destroyer was equipped with four single-mounted 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" guns. The vessel was also fitted with four torpedo tubes for Mk IX torpedoes. Construction and career Iroquois was ordered on 5 April 1940 as part of the 1940 shipbuilding programme. The destroyer was laid down on 19 September 1940 by Vickers-Armstrong at Newcastle on Tyne in the United Kingdom and launched 23 September the following year. Iroquois was originally laid down as Athabaskan. However, due to bomb damage, she and her sister had their names switched in order to ensure Iroquois commissioned first.Boutiller, p. 107 She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Newcastle on Tyne on 30 November 1942. The destroyer was not completed until 30 January 1943. Following her completion, Iroquois began sea trials, suffering storm damage near the Faroes, which included a bent keel and required repairs. Further trials continued in the North Sea until May 1943 when she departed for Plymouth.Schull, pp. 188‚Äì190 From there the destroyer was used as a convoy escort on Gibraltar convoys. On 11 July, three Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors from Kampfgeschwader 40 attacked a troop transport convoy west of Oporto in the Bay of Biscay. Iroquois was attacked by the aircraft, missing the destroyer with bombs astern.Schull, p. 191 The German aircraft hit and which were abandoned.Rohwer, p. 262 Iroquois rescued 628 survivors from Duchess of York. On 19 July an event termed \\"incident\\" in official reports took place where according to the inquiry afterwards, a large section of the ship's company refused to perform their duties.Boutiller, p. 236Schull, p. 192 Iroquois was among the destroyers deployed to cover escort forces attacking U-boats in the Bay of Biscay from 12 June to 2 August 1943.Rohwer, p. 257 =Northern operations= Following her return to the UK, Iroquois was assigned to escort convoys heading to the Soviet Union over the following months. From 1‚Äì11 October, Iroquois and the destroyers and transported supplies to Murmansk for the escorts that remained there in the summer.Rohwer, p. 279 Beginning in November, Iroquois provided support to Russian convoys, beginning with convoy JW 54A from Loch Ewe on 18‚Äì24 November and convoy RA 54B from Molotvsk on 28 November.Rohwer, p. 286 In late December, Iroquois escorted the convoy JW 55B. It came under air attack on 23 December, but was unscathed.Rohwer, pp. 292‚Äì93 The convoy sailed as a lure for the , which was sunk by British forces on 26 December.Schull, p. 198 On 31 December, the warship was among the escort for RA 55B which departed Kola Inlet on 31 December and reached Loch Ewe on 8 January without loss. =English Channel and the end of the war= In February 1944, she sailed to Halifax to undergo a refit that would keep her out of action until early June.Schull, p. 250 She returned to the UK and was assigned to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla in preparation for the Invasion of Normandy. After D-day, she carried out patrols of the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. During this period, Iroquois took part in many operations, including Kinetic, the objective of which was to eliminate the German navy all along the French Atlantic ports, taking part in three actions, including the Battle of Audierne Bay in August 1944. On 5 August 1944, a force comprising the cruiser and the destroyers , , and Iroquois engaged and sank the German minesweepers M 263 and M 486 and the patrol boat V 414, coastal launch Otto from a German convoy north of √éle d'Yeu.Rohwer, p. 347 Iroquois was responsible for the sinking of two of the vessels.Schull, p. 349 On 14 August, Iroquois joined the destroyer and cruiser to attack a German force off Les Sables d'Olonne and sank Sperrbrecher 157; they also badly damaged M 275 and ran M 385 aground. On 22‚Äì23 August Mauritius, Ursa and Iroquois sank V 702, V 717, V 720, V 729 and V 730 of Audierne. The destroyer continued patrolling the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel until October 1944, when she transferred to Scapa Flow.Schull, p. 359 Iroquois rejoined the Home Fleet in March 1945 at Scapa Flow. The ship was part of the screening force for aircraft carriers on 19 March and again on 24 March, which were performing air strikes along coastal Norway.Schull, p. 401 She then escorted one more convoy to the Soviet Union. On 16 April, Iroquois departed as part of the escort of JW 66.Rohwer, p. 410 From 29 April-2 May, Iroquois participated in the last convoy battle of the war as part of the escort for convoy RA 66. Iroquois and Haida were just missed by torpedoes in an attack by . They in turn pursued the submarine in which by the end of the engagement, 678 depth charge explosions were counted without sinking the submarine.Rohwer, p. 412 Iroquois remained in British waters until the German surrender.Schull, p. 405 Following the capitulation, Iroquois was part of Crown Prince Olav's return to Norway after its liberation. She then sailed on to Copenhagen where she was an escort to the German cruisers and until their formal surrender.Rohwer, p. 416 The destroyer returned to Canada and began a tropicalization refit that was halted upon the surrender of Japan. Iroquois was then paid off on 22 February 1946. =Cold War service= Beginning in 1947, Iroquois underwent conversion to a destroyer escort, the first of her class to undergo the alterations. The changes involved her 4.7-inch main armament which were replaced with 4-inch guns in the 'A' and 'B' turret positions; in the 'X', a twin /50 calibre gun mount was installed and in the 'Y' site, two Squid anti-submarine mortars were located.The 50 calibre denotes the length of the gun. This means that the length of the gun barrel is 50 times the bore diameter. Other alterations included an aluminum lattice with new radar.Boutiller, p. 322Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 41 Iroquois was equipped with Type 275, SPS-10, SPS-6, Type 293 and 262 radars and Type 140 and 174 sonars. She emerged from her refit on 24 June 1949 and was recommissioned as a training ship with Lieutenant Commander T. C. Pullen in command. She was renumbered as DDE217. On 21 October 1951, Commander William Landymore assumed command of the ship as a regular vessel of the Royal Canadian Navy. Iroquois served off Korea during the Korean War, commanded by Landymore.Milner, p. 1173 Iroquois departed Halifax on 21 April 1952 and arrived in theatre to replace Cayuga on 12 June. Her first assignment was carrier screening on Korean the west coast.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 99, 141 For the majority of 1952, Iroquois supported the Island campaign off the west coast.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 104 On 2 October, Iroquois in concert with , was bombarding a rail line on the east coast southwest of Songjin when she was hit by a shell on the starboard side abreast of 'B' gun. Two men were killed and eleven injured, with one dying later of his injuries. The destroyer remained on station for two weeks before returning to Sasebo.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 110‚Äì11 These were the only Royal Canadian Navy casualties in the war. Iroquois saw service screening the aircraft carrier and an inshore patrol on the west coast before sailing for Canada on 26 November. She was replaced by Athabaskan. Iroquois returned to Halifax on 8 January 1953.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 113, 141 Iroquois sailed for Korea on 29 April 1953 and upon her return to the theatre on 18 June 1953, the destroyer returned to the Chodo area to support the Island campaign off the west coast.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 127, 141 The destroyer supported the Island campaign in the Haeju area and performed screening missions with carriers off the west coast before the end of hostilities on 29 July 1953.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 128‚Äì29 Following the end of hostilities, Iroquois was deployed evacuating islands that had been handed back to North Korea in the armistice and completed the first post-armistice patrol.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 129‚Äì30 On 1 November 1953, Lieutenant Commander S. G. Moore assumed command of the vessel. Iroquois remained in theatre until 1 January 1954.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 130 The destroyer returned to Halifax on 10 February 1954 via the Suez Canal, circumnavigating the globe in the process. Iroquois made one further post-Armistice patrol off the Korean coasts, departing Halifax on 1 July 1954 and arriving off Korea on 22 August. The ship departed the theatre on 26 December and returned to Halifax via the Suez Canal again on 19 March 1955. Iroquois circumnavigated the globe a second time on her return to Halifax.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 141 She returned to her training role and remained as such until 1962. Iroquois was paid off at Halifax on 24 October 1962 and laid up at Sydney. In 1966 the vessel was taken to Bilbao, Spain and broken up in September.Colledge, p. 320 Ship's badge The ship's badge is described as a blazon or, the head of an Iroquois brave, couped at the base of the neck, properly coloured and wearing two eagle feathers in his hair and a gold ring pendant from the ear. During the Second World War and up to 1948 when official badges were created for the Royal Canadian Navy, Iroquois had an unofficial crest. This crest consisted of an Iroquois brave, red, drawing a bow on a black background. Below the warrior was the ship's motto \\"Ongwanonsionni\\" which translates as \\"Relentless in pursuit\\". Above the warrior was a ship's crown.

In the immediate aftermath of the War, the bulk of the division was deployed to French Indochina to oversee the handover from Japanese to French rule. For nearly all is operational life the division was commanded by Major General Douglas Gracey https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137448699#aboutBook Formation The division was formed at Bangalore in April, 1942. It was commanded by Major General Douglas Gracey and at first it consisted of the Indian 32nd, 51st and 53rd Brigades. In July that year, the 51st and 53rd Brigades were detached to form the Indian 25th Infantry Division and replaced by the Indian 80th Infantry Brigade and Indian 100th Infantry Brigade (the latter brigade being transferred from the 34th Division which had recently disbanded in Ceylon). The division was intended from the start for operations in jungle and mountain and was on a Mixed Animal and Mechanical Transport establishment for maintenance in rough country. The division's insignia was a hand wielding a tulwar, in white on black. After training in Southern India and Ceylon, the Division joined Indian XV Corps at Ranchi in Bihar in December, but from July 1943, it was transferred to IV Corps in Imphal. Battle of Imphal At the start of the Battle, 20th Division was deployed forward to Tamu in the Kabaw Valley. To avoid being cut off, it retreated to the Shenam Saddle in the hills surrounding the Imphal Plain. Because the 17th Indian Infantry Division was in difficulty in its sector, the 32nd Brigade was temporarily detached to it. With other detachments, the 20th Division was reduced to only five battalions, to defend the Saddle against the Japanese Yamamoto Force. During April and the first part of May, the division held the saddle against attacks by infantry, tanks and heavy artillery. It was then relieved in place and ordered to counter-attack, north-east from Imphal to Ukhrul. The monsoon had broken and movement was very difficult. After several Japanese counter-attacks, at the start of July the division was transferred to the XXXIII Indian Corps and slowly eliminated large numbers of Japanese in and around the village, which had been made into a Japanese communication and logistic centre. Battle of Central Burma Prome, Burma (3 May 1945) During the remainder of the monsoon, the division rested around Dimapur. As the monsoon ended, it moved into a bridgehead across the Chindwin River at Kalewa. It attacked southward on 4 December and cleared Japanese rearguards from Monywa. On 13 February 1945, the division made a crossing of the Irrawaddy River west of Mandalay. The boats used were leaky and other items of equipment already worn out. The first precarious footholds were counter-attacked every night for a week but eventually linked up into a solid bridgehead. On 13 March, the 20th Division attacked southward, gaining immediate success against the understrength Japanese 31st Division. A column formed from the divisional reconnaissance unit and an attached tank unit, known as Claudecol, reached far into the Japanese rear, before turning north and mopping up the disorganised enemy. Southern Burma In early April, two brigades were converted to lorried infantry by acquiring the vehicles from the British 2nd Infantry Division which was being withdrawn to India. The division fought its way southward along the east bank of the Irrawaddy, until it met units of the XV Indian Corps, which had occupied Rangoon in Operation Dracula. During this period the 22nd (East Africa) Infantry Brigade was attached to the division, from 28 June to 11 August 1945. Indochina In August 1945, the Japanese surrendered after two atomic weapons were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allied South East Asia Command (SEAC) area of responsibility, was expanded to embrace several countries including French Indochina. While Chinese Nationalist troops occupied the northern part of the country, Gracey's division occupied the southern part in Operation Masterdom.https://codenames.info/operation/masterdom/ The division was to release former Allied prisoners of war and disarm and repatriate Japanese units. Later, the division was instructed to hand over to the returning French regime, before returning to India. There were several battles with Viet Minh, who were intent on achieving independence. Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, on Gracey's Intelligence Section Staff, learned of an impending Viet Minh attack on Saigon.

The forest is headquarters for Massachusetts Bureau of Forest Fire Control District 8 and is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. History The Crow Hill ledges were used by Native Americans for shelter and signaling. Artifacts in the forest include cellar holes, stonewalls, fruit trees and other remnants of Notown, an unincorporated 18th-century settlement that was annexed into adjoining municipalities in 1838. The state's first purchase at the site took place in 1922, with expansions seen in many following years including 2002. The Civilian Conservation Corps was active in the forest from 1932 to 1938, constructing a network of roads, working on the park headquarters, and developing the area at Crow Hill Pond. Activities and amenities Forest trails for hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling include a section of the Massachusetts Midstate Trail. Swimming is permitted at the beach on Crow Hill Pond, which has a bathhouse and picnicking area, and rock climbing takes place on the Crow Hills cliffs. Non-motorized boating is offered at Paradise Pond. Barrett's Pond and Crow Hill Pond are stocked with trout by the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. The forest also offers restricted hunting.

Language The traditional language of the people was Guugu Yalandji. It has been comprehensively studied, with a dictionary produced by the Hershbergers and a grammar by Elizabeth Patz. Country The Kuku Yalanji, according to Norman Tindale, held roughly of territory around the headwaters of the Palmer River. Their land ran east from Palmerville station to Mount Lukin, and stretched over the southern and western areas of the Dividing Range as far as the upper Mitchell River. their eastern limits lay around east to Byerstown, and they were present at Maytown. Today The Kuku Yalanji, believed to number some 3,000 people (2003), constitute one of the \\"Bama Rainforest Peoples\\". They are reputedly closely related to the Wulpura rain forest dwellers on the plateau in the modern day Mount Windsor National Park. History of contact Kuku Yalanji lands began to be occupied extensively by white colonisers in 1877, after the government opened up their area to selection, and as miners crowded into the area, where the Palmer River gold rush had been underway since news leaked out of a discovery of that mineral in June 1873.time. Within a year over 5,000 Europeans and 2,000 Chinese, mainly from Guangdong, crammed into the Palmer River site, until then the sole preserve of Kuku Yalanji people, to work its riches. Attempts made to uproot the people from their land were resisted, and a Lutheran mission opened up on the Bloomfield River in 1886 failed within 16 years of its establishment. century. Forced removals of some Kuku-Yalanji were undertaken again in the 1930s, with their relocation to missions at Daintree and Mossman. As late as 1957, a further attempt to relocate groups to a mission in Bloomfield took place. The gold rush lasted from 1873 to 1885, with the Palmer population of Chinese briefly skyrocketing to some 17,000 by 1877, until the opportunities for quick takings began to dwindle, with most Europeans leaving by 1880, and the Chinese numbers dropping drastically to 3,000. In response to this overwhelming invasion, the Kuku Yalanji set up a fierce resistance virtually tantamount to guerilla warfare. The Kuku Yalanji eventually were reduced to living in shanty towns on the outskirts of the areas which the foreign populations developed, and developed skills for working in the new economy. Often, in trading their services with the Chinese, they were paid in opium, which could be imported legally until 1906. According to contemporary European observers appointed as protectors of Aborigines, such as Walter Roth and Archibald Meston, consumption of this drug in the form of opium ash mixed with water, accounted for thousands of native deaths, far more than those due to other introduced maladies such as venereal disease. Modern historians now consider that these early reports, like the often bruited tales of the Kuku Yalanji hunting Chinese for cannibalistic feasting, whatever partial truth they contain, perhaps functioned to assuage any guilt European settlers may have felt for their key role in the decimation of northern Queensland aboriginal communities. From 1897 to the 1960s, the Kuku Yalanji like other Aboriginal peoples faced the Government's paternalistic legislation that allowed for Aboriginal people to be placed under \\"protection\\" in attempt to preserve their culture, placing them in Aboriginal reserves. The Kuku Yalanji began concentrating around the Mossman Reserve around the time of World War II and the people in the Daintree region were forced to the northern bank of the Daintree River. They were further subjected to more relocations by the government. Kuku Yalanji are now concentrated predominantly in Mossman and Wujal Wujal. Traditional lifestyle hut built by Indigenous Australians such as the Kuku Yalanji people. Survival was dependent on the exploitation of seasonal variation. It is believed that Kuku Yalanji lived in the rainforest region no later than 4,000 years ago. It is known that they had high population density, and lived in semi-permanent gunyahs. Their staples for obtaining carbohydrates were the toxic seeds of Cycas media, which were leached of their poisonous compounds before cooking; two species of yam, with the variety known as bitter yam particularly sought after, supplemented by bitter walnut, candlenuts and Kuranda quandong. They classified the annual climatic cycle into five seasons. Early reports often wrote that the Kuku Yalanji were devoted to cannibalism, targeting in particular Chinese immigrants, whom they called kubara or miran bilin (tight eyes). It is not infrequent to encounter early accounts of the eating of parts of the dead, which however was a restricted practice related to ritual mortuary customs. The vivid narrations of their killing their own women and children for eating to allay their hunger or of \\"feasting\\" on Chinese like \\"manna from heaven\\" in popular works like that of Hector Holthouse, are now considered wild exaggerations, since the actual evidence is skimpy. Christopher Anderson, who transcribed one account by an elderly fully initiated Kuku Yalanji man glosses the story by suggesting that:- > Apart from the probably rare actual incidents human flesh consumption, the > strong European belief in Aboriginal cannibalism in this area arose and > persists today, I would argue, as an ideological mechanism: it states and > reinforces the belief that Aborigines were less human or at the very least > were \\"uncivilized\\" (if they ate other humans). then justified their removal > from the land and their extermination. Native title The Kuku-Yalanji people registered a Native Title Claim over parts of their traditional land in May 1995. The eastern Kuku Yalanji people were eventually recognised as the traditional owners of their land in the form of 15 Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs) in April 2007, covering more than between Mossman and Cooktown. In the agreements, signed on 19 October 2007, were designated as freehold land, partly for conservation and partly for residential or economic development use. The majority of the land would be managed by the Eastern Kuku Yalanji people and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS). In its determination, finalised on 9 December 2007, the Federal Court of Australia recognised that the Eastern Kuku Yalanji People have exclusive native title rights over of unallocated state land, which means that they \\"possess, occupy and use the area to the exclusion of all others\\" and have rights of succession and inheritance. In most of the area, which comprise of timber reserve, term leases and special leases, the Eastern Kuku Yalanji People have non-exclusive rights to hunting, camping, conducting ceremonies, burials, use of water and various other shared rights. The land is managed by an RNTBC, the Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation, which belongs to the Cape York Land Council.

The group is owned by German automotive manufacturer Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini, which is in turn owned by the Volkswagen Group. The group currently comprises four companies: * Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A., a motorcycle-manufacturing division previously known as Ducati Meccanica * Ducati Corse, which runs the Ducati motorcycle racing program and is wholly owned by Ducati Motor Holding * Ducati Energia, formerly known as Ducati Elettronica, a designer and manufacturer of electrical and electronic components and systems * Ducati Sistemi, a subsidiary of Ducati Energia, which provides electronic and information- technology products for road transport, railway transport, and transport automation applications In the 1930s and 1940s, Ducati manufactured radios, cameras, and electrical products such as razors. Ducati also made a marine binocular called the BIMAR for the Kriegsmarine during World War II, some of which were sold on the civilian market after the war. The Ducati Sogno was a half-frame Leica-like camera which is now a collector's item. Ducati and Bianchi have developed and launched a new line of racing bicycles. Ducati Motor Holding often uses electrical components and subsystems from Ducati Energia.  History  In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons, Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati; founded Societ√† Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes, condensers and other radio components. In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city. Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing. Ducati Factory Ducati \\"Cucciolo\\", 1950 The company started manufacturing motorcycle-related items when in 1950, manufacturing the \\"Cucciolo\\", an engine for mounting on bicycles, for a small Turinese firm, SIATA (Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto- Aviatorie), later selling a product of their own based on the Cucciolo. In the following years, the company expanded their offer when the marked moved on to larger motorcycles. In 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Ducati Elettronica became Ducati Energia SpA in the eighties. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250 cc road bike then available, the Mach 1. In 1985, Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the \\"Cagiva\\" name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the \\"Ducati\\" name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company \\"Ducati Motor Holding SpA\\". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi. In April 2012, Volkswagen Group's Audi subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for ‚Ç¨ (US$). Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Pi√´ch, a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984. Analysts doubted a tiny motorcycle maker would have a meaningful effect on a company the size of Volkswagen, commenting that the acquisition has \\"a trophy feel to it,\\" and, \\"is driven by VW's passion for nameplates rather than industrial or financial logic\\".

Spurgeon. which took place on a mountainside in the open air.Biblegateway.com, New International Version, Matthew 5:1 In the Gospel of Luke (), it was recorded that Jesus also gave an open-air sermon known as the Sermon on the Plain. After Jesus' death, many of his apostles and followers open-air preached the gospel in the Temple of Jerusalem or in other open spaces.Spurgeon, Pg. 234 During the Middle Ages it was used. During Protestant Reformation, open-air preaching was often employed by Protestants throughout EuropeSpurgeon, Pg. 235 who could not always preach inside churches, which were mostly Catholic.Spurgeon, Pg. 236 Open-air preaching in Europe continued during the rise of Puritanism and other Protestant movements. It was often used in Pastoral environments as well as in cities, the former sometimes due to a desire to avoid the authorities,Spurgeon, Pg. 241 and the latter because, for one reason, it could reach eccentric people living in cities who would not otherwise hear the gospel.Spurgeon, Pg. 257 In the time period of the late 19th century and early-to-mid-20th century many famous open-air preachers in the United States began to preach, such as Billy Sundayhttp://www.christianitytoday.com/history/special/131christians/sunday.html \\"Billy Sunday Salty evangelist\\", ChristianityToday.com and Billy Graham. Graham in particular used a combination of open-air preaching and the recent advent of televangelism to broadcast his sermons, which often took place in large venues such as stadiums, to large portions of the world and millions of Americans. John Wesley, founder of Methodism declared, \\"I am well assured that I did far more good to my Lincolnshire parishioners by preaching three days on my father's tomb than I did by preaching three years in his pulpit ... To this day field preaching is a cross to me, but I know my commission and see no other way of preaching the gospel to every creature.\\" Wesley's contemporary, Anglican preacher George Whitefield stated: \\"I believe I never was more acceptable to my Master than when I was standing to teach those hearers in the open fields ... I now preach to ten times more people than I should, if had been confined to the churches.\\" Including the \\"field\\" outside Park Street. It was said that one of the regular practices of America evangelist Dwight L. Moody in the late 1860s \\"was to exhort the passersby in the evenings from the steps of the court house. Often these impromptu gathering drew as many hecklers as supporters.\\" Open-air preachers throughout history have often noted that preaching to large crowds often causes preachers to be abused in certain ways, typically by having objects thrown at them such as rotting vegetables or unsanitary liquids of many varieties.Spurgeon, Pg. 250 Charles Spurgeon, the famous open-air Baptist preacher of England, believed that open- air preaching was instrumental in getting people to hear the gospel who might otherwise never hear it,Spurgeon, Pg. 255 and many open-air preachers today believe that it reaches many more people at once than other approaches to evangelism do.\\"The Evidence Bible\\", Ray Comfort, Bridge-Logos Publishers, 2003, p. 1183 Charles Spurgeon recommends several things for open-air preachers, such as never trying to speak into the wind, trying to speak away from the wind so one's voice will carry farther, (sometimes up to half a mile by Spurgeon's account) keeping sermons concise instead of overly verbose and complicated, use illustrations and anecdotes to keep the crowd interested, and to not speak at the very top of your voice so you don't wear yourself out too quickly. Spurgeon also recommended to never use tents when preaching due to their muffling effects,Spurgeon, Pg. 258 and to be careful of what is on the other side of walls you may be preaching in front of, since people behind the wall or living in spaces in buildings could harass preachers.Spurgeon, Pg. 256  Trickle-down evangelism  Trickle-down evangelism is an approach to evangelism primarily concerned with converting high-ranking members of a society, so that their influence can serve to help spread Christianity throughout the society in question. It was practiced especially often during the Middle Ages. Trickle-down evangelism was practiced throughout China multiple times during the Middle Ages, with examples such as converted or sympathetic officials helping the Jesuits or other parts of the Catholic church spread,http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03669a.htm \\"The Church in China\\", Written by Henri Cordier. Transcribed by M. Donahue. The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume III. Published 1908. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Nihil; http://www.christianitytoday.com/workplace/articles/wycliffingworkplace.html \\"Wycliffing the Workplace ‚Ä¶ and Other Evangelism Lessons from the Missionary Trenches\\", FaithInTheWorkplace.com, Randy Kilgore, October 1, 2004, Retrieved May 27, 2007 or the expedition of Marco Polo resulting in the Mongol ruler of China Kublai Khan inviting the Pope to send \\"teachers of science and religion\\" to China.\\"Trickle-Down Evangelism\\", Ralph R. Covell Trickle-down evangelism was also applied often in European areas during ancient times, such as in the northern Sweden area, as the Catholic Church tried to send missionaries into the area.  Door-to-door preaching  Door-to-door preaching is an approach to evangelism where a Christian will go from household to household in a certain area to evangelize to residents, often in conjunction with passing out gospel tracts. Jesus often went into other people's homes during his own ministry, and according to The Encyclopedia of Protestantism, it is a very important approach to evangelism.Barret, Pg. 721 One of the first modern large-scale uses of door-to-door preaching was when the Oriental Mission Society attempted to visit the homes of an entire nation, by visiting 10.3 million homes in Japan from 1912 to 1917. The international organization Every Home for Christ began door-to-door preaching in 1953 throughout many countries, and as of 2010, total home visits by their members became 1.3 billion. Many local parishes and churches worldwide use this approach to evangelism. Groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons are famous in particular for spreading their beliefs by door to door evangelism at people's homes, often in pairs or small groups. Both groups' main organizations use door-to-door preaching to a great extent. Full-time missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints use this, and other techniques, to find people to teach.Davies, Pg. 1316  Evangelizing through a sermon  Many churches regularly have a gospel message preached in a sermon. Often, this will include an altar call where people are invited to come forward and accept Christ. The use of altar calls is somewhat controversial, while it is practiced by many evangelical churches, some Calvinists object to it in the grounds it creates false conversions.http://www.9marks.org/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID314526CHID629094CIID1804792,00.html \\"Altar Call Evangelism\\", Paul Alexander Bible Baptists also do not practice \\"Altar Call Evangelism\\", because they believe that faith comes by hearing and understanding the Word of God, thus a one-on sermon cannot be sufficient for one to absolutely understand what he is believing on. Lifestyle evangelism Lifestyle evangelism is an approach to evangelism characterized by someone demonstrating their faith by their actions in the hope that people around them will be impressed with how God affects that person's life, and become a Christian. According to The Encyclopedia of Protestantism printed in 2004, approximately 100 million people use this approach to evangelism.Barret, Pg. 721 Supporters of this approach to evangelism often cite Matthew 5:16 as a proof verse.\\"The Evidence Bible\\", Ray Comfort, Bridge-Logos Publishers, 2003, p. 842\\"1,001 Practical Ways to Share God's Love\\", Richard Lee Supporters also often point out that Jesus drew people to God by showing them kindness and performing good deeds, while detractors sometimes note that people may not realize one's good behavior is due to Christianity. Supporters claim this is more effective than direct evangelism because of the perception that it is harder to live \\"righteously\\" than to preach a sermon. Friendship evangelism Similar to lifestyle evangelism, friendship evangelism is an approach to evangelism characterized by Christians developing relationships with people in order to show them kindness and talk to them about God eventually. Supporters sometimes say that Jesus related to those who took an interest in him as friends, or that it is more effective than other methods of evangelism which are seen as less personal.\\"The Christian Witness to the Muslim\\", John Gilchrist, pp. 37-58 This approach is also known as \\"loving someone into the kingdom\\". Opponents hold that friendship evangelism contrasts with the approach of Jesus, Paul and the apostles towards preaching the gospel. Missionary dating takes this a step further and Flirty Fishing takes it to an extreme.  Child evangelism  The child evangelism movement is a Christian evangelism movement that was begun in the 20th century. It focuses on the 4/14 Window which centers on evangelizing children between the ages of 4 and 14 years old. Creative evangelism This approach to evangelism is where the creative arts (such as music, visual art, drama, film) are used to present a gospel message.Saltmine Creative Arts , retrieved October 1, 2006 Examples include Wendy Alec's novel \\"The Fall of Lucifer\\", Christian rock band Delirious? and Johann Sebastian Bach's musical composition \\"Matth√§uspassion\\" (Saint Matthew Passion).Barret, Pg. 720 However, some ministries refer to this kind of evangelism as simply the practice of finding creative ways to evangelize. One of the most famous examples of creative evangelism is George Handel's oratio, \\"Messiah\\", written in 1741. It is the most performed major choral work in history, has been tied to the revival of the Church of England and to influencing famous evangelist John Wesley's theology concerning Eternal security, and in modern times, has around four million viewers per year.Barret, Pg. 720-721 Campus Crusade for Christ, an evangelical Christian association with branches in a multitude of countries, owns the distribution rights for a movie called \\"Jesus Film\\", a presentation of the life of Jesus Christ. This movie, which has been translated into 80 languages, has been viewed by about 850 million people.Blumhofer, Pg. 730 In the Church of Pakistan, the Diocese of Hyderbad uses this approach to evangelism among tribal groups in areas of Pakistan which have a high population of Sindhis.http://www.pcusa.org/worldwide/pakistan/programministries.htm Presbyterian Church U.S.A., \\"Pakistan Programs and Projects < Evangelism < Hyderbad Diocese Tribal Evangelism\\", Retrieved May 27, 2007 Using Gospel tracts A gospel tract in the Christian sense is a leaflet with a gospel message. It is typically a short presentation of the Gospel lasting only a few pages, and is typically printed on small pieces of paper.Barret, Pg. 725 Estimated numbers of tracts distributed in the year 2000 amount to around 5 billion. It is often used in conjunction with street preaching or door to door preaching. As an approach to evangelism, many modern evangelists attest to the usefulness of gospel tracts to spread the gospel. Televangelism Televangelism is an approach to evangelism characterized by an evangelistic message presented through the medium of television,God TV homepage , retrieved October 1, 2006 often through a charismatic sermon. Large Christian television networks such as the Catholic broadcasting channel EWTN or the Protestant televangelism channel Trinity Broadcasting Network feature many televangelist preachers. Televangelism was started in the United States and Canada in the mid-20th century, as a primarily evangelical Protestant approach to evangelism. It made Christian viewpoints much more visible in the world at the time than they were before.Guenther, Pg. 710 Radio evangelism Radio evangelism is an approach to evangelism which began around 1921, and has reached more people per hour than any other kind of evangelism, according to The Encyclopedia of Protestantism. It is the usage of radio broadcasts to evangelize to listeners, sometimes worldwide in one broadcast. Maria Miranda, the most listened to radio evangelist from Latin America in 1990, was heard by over 100 million people per day through 537 radio stations in 22 countries during that time.Barret, Pg. 721 In Yemen, a country in which 97 percent of the country is listed as Muslim,Embassy of the Republic of Yemen Ottawa, Canada, \\"About Yemen\\", Retrieved June 29, 2007 10 percent of the population listens to Christian radio. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod has had a radio station on KFUO called \\"The Lutheran Hour\\" since 1925, had 5 million listeners by 1931, and broadcast in over 31 languages with 40 million listeners in 1987.Barret, Pg. 721 The first missionary specific radio station, HCJB, went on the air in Ecuador on December 25, 1931.Blumhofer, Pg. 732 Internet evangelism Internet evangelism is a form of evangelism where the Christian gospel is presented on the Internet.Internet Evangelism Day homepage , retrieved October 1, 2006 This may include a website presenting apologetics about biblical innerrancy, social media church services, someone discussing their faith in a chat room, evangelical messages or advertisements on the home pages of Christian organizations, or other methods of using the Internet to spread Christianity. In the United States, the Internet Evangelism Coalition, set up by the Billy Graham Center in 1999, initiated Internet Evangelism Day on the last Sunday of April every year. In their Pew Internet and American Life Project, the Pew Research Center found that \\"Nearly two-thirds of online Americans use the Internet for faith-related reasons. The sixty-four percent of Internet users who perform spiritual and religious activities online represent nearly eighty-two million Americans\\".‚ÄúPew Internet and American Life Project, The Role of the Internet in American Society Among the most popular and important spiritually related online activities: * Thirty-eight percent of the nation's 128 million Internet users have sent and received email with spiritual content. * Thirty-five percent have sent or received online greeting cards related to religious holidays. * Thirty-two percent have gone online to read news accounts of religious events and affairs. * Twenty-one percent have sought information about how to celebrate religious holidays. * Seventeen percent have looked for information about where they could attend religious services. * Seven percent have made or responded to online prayer requests. * Seven percent have made donations to religious organizations or charities. Phone evangelism This approach to evangelism involves using phones to contact people in order to spread the gospel to them. This sometimes takes the form of random phone calls, or is done after someone contacts the evangelist to recommend people to whom a person may want the evangelist to evangelize. The huge growth in cell phones and other mobile devices is opening up the way for new and creative methods of evangelism. Personal evangelism Sometimes referred to as \\"one to one\\" or \\"personal work\\", this approach to evangelism is when one Christian evangelizes to, typically, one non-Christian, or only a few non-Christians, in a private manner.Barret, Pg. 721 A 1982 Gallup Poll revealed that 51 percent of all Americans had tried to convince someone to become a Christian during their life.  Creation evangelism  Not to be confused with creative evangelism, creation evangelism uses the truths of modern science to demonstrate the scientific accuracy of events described in the Bible, usually those found in Genesis. In demonstrating that the Biblical account is indeed supported by modern science, one may influence an unsaved individual to realize the existence of God and His certain judgment described in the Bible; eventually leading the person to become saved through Jesus Christ.  Archaeology evangelism  Used with considerable success by groups such as Seventh-day Adventists and Christadelphians, practitioners use archaeological discoveries to demonstrate the historical and prophetic reliability of the Bible. The ready availability of archaeological programs on radio and television has made this approach less popular and effective than in earlier years. At one time this approach drew large crowds to London's New Gallery Theatre and the Opera House in Sydney with David Down, as well as many less prestigious venues such as halls and churches.  Prophetic evangelism  A method employed mainly by charismatic Christians. This is where (as its practitioners believe) God speaks through a Christian to a non-believer to say something that will prompt that person to seek God. On most occasions it is something that the speaker could not have known naturally; for example, someone who is having a secret affair may be told that God knows they are doing wrong and wants them to change their ways. However, some critics of this approach note that other religions appear to use a similar method to spread their faith. = Treasure hunts = So called treasure hunts are a type of prophetic evangelism.Dedmon, Kevin (2007). The Ultimate Treasure Hunt. Destiny Image. . A small group of Christians takes time to pray and listen to revelation from the Holy Spirit about people God wants the group to find. There is a close correlation to personal evangelism. This type of evangelism may be referred to as a game of searching for God's treasures, which are people. The group typically receives revelation, or \\"clues\\", consisting of places, clothing, hairstyle, or situations which will help identify the \\"treasure\\". After receiving these revelations, the group goes out and looks for the people identified by the clues. Sometimes they are able to speak God's love and the Gospel of Jesus Christ into somebody's life. On other occasions the group prays for the person's healing or other needs. The main focus in this type of evangelism is to let people know that they are valuable to God and that God is searching for them as his treasure.  Use of props  Various props may serve as visual aids to accompany the verbal explanation of the Gospel message in many of the above approaches. Such props include variations on the Wordless Book, commercial products such as the eCube, and specialized flannelgraph or flip chart sets.

It has edible fruits which are under development as a commercial crop. According to the Swingle system it is not part of the genus Citrus, but in a related genus Microcitrus.  Description  The plant is in height. Leaves are small, long and wide, glabrous, with a notched tip and crenate towards the apex. Flowers are white with petals long. The fruit is cylindrical, long, sometimes slightly curved, coming in different colours, including pink and green.  Cultivation and uses  = History = Early settlers consumed the fruitLow, Tim, Wild Food Plants of Australia, and retained the trees when clearing for agriculture. Colonial botanists suggested that they should be cultivated. = Rising demand = Red finger lime with juice vesicles partially extracted The finger lime has been recently popularised as a gourmet bushfood. The globular juice vesicles (also known as pearls) have been likened to a \\"lime caviar\\", which can be used as a garnish or added to various recipes. The fresh vesicles have the effect of a burst of effervescent tangy flavour as they are chewed. The fruit juice is acidic and similar to that of a lime. Marmalade and pickles are also made from finger lime. The finger lime peel can be dried and used as a flavouring spice. Commercial use of finger lime fruit started in the mid-1990s in boutique marmalades made from wild harvested fruit. By 2000 the finger lime was being sold in restaurants, including the export of fresh fruit. The finger lime has been recently grown on a commercial basis in Australia in response to high demand for the fruit. There is an increasing range of genetic selections which are budded onto citrus rootstock. With the sudden high market demand for the fruit the primary source of genetic material for propagation has been selections from wild stock. = Diseases = Two red finger limes, shown next to an Australian ten-cent coin ( diameter) In cultivation, the finger lime plant is grown in much the same way as other citrus species. It may be subject to some pests and diseases requiring pest control in cropping situations. This includes scale, caterpillars, gall-wasp, and limb dieback. Research into fruit fly has concluded that finger limes are a non-host plant to fruit flies and as such are not a quarantine risk to importing countries. Research conducted since the 1970s indicated that a wild selection of C. australasica was highly resistant to Phytophthora citrophthora root disease, which has resulted in a cross-breeding program with finger lime to develop disease-resistant citrus rootstock. In 2020, researchers began working with C. australasica to develop solutions for Citrus greening disease. The CSIRO has also developed several Citrus hybrids by crossing the finger lime with standard Citrus species. These hybrids have created many cultivars which generate finger limes in many different colors ranging from light pink to deep blue-green. Finger lime is thought to have the widest range of color variation within any Citrus species. The color of the pulp (juice vesicles) comes in shades of green or pink including pale lime-green, pale pink, coral, and scarlet.

Crotalus lepidus klauberi is a venomous pitviper subspecies endemic to the southwestern United States and adjacent northern Mexico. Geographic range In the United States C. l. klauberi is found in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. In Mexico it is found in the Mexican states of Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Jalisco, Nuevo Le√≥n, San Luis Potos√≠, Sonora, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas. Etymology The specific name or epithet, klauberi, is in honor of American herpetologist and rattlesnake expert Laurence M. Klauber.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2011. The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Crotalus lepidus klauberi, p. 143). Description Crotalus lepidus klauberi Adults rarely grow to more than in length. The color pattern is typically a light grey with darker grey banding that varies greatly from habitat to habitat. The background color may be green to purple in some locations. Those found in the Franklin Mountain range of El Paso County in Texas are unique, having a striking pearl silver background and well defined black crossbands. The characters used to distinguish the various subspecies have been a point of contention for many years. Various sources have used scale counts, number of bands, the stripe along the eye region and the amount of mottling between bands as methods to tell them apart. Unfortunately, research has shown that there are always exceptions. It is generally accepted, however, that C. l. klauberi lacks mottling between the darker bands, even though this is not an entirely reliable method. It is not known whether the subspecies intergrade in the areas where their ranges overlap. Common names Banded rock rattlesnake, blue rattlesnake, green rattlesnake, green rock rattlesnake, rock rattlesnake. Behavior These are nocturnal, secretive snakes. They spend most of their time hiding in rock crevices. Often found in canyons, scree slopes, or man- made road cuts. Research has shown that they do not typically travel far, and often spend their entire lives on one particular slope or ridge. Their diet consists of primarily lizards and rodents. They are quite shy snakes, often not even rattling if approached, relying instead on their camouflage to blend into the rocky habitat. They are most likely to be seen after a summer afternoon thunderstorm, or rain shower, when they come out to bask and search for food. In contrast to the shyness described above, Banded Rock Rattlesnake specimens found high (>7000 ft) in the Organ Mountains of southern New Mexico are usually highly confident and defensive, rattling incessantly at the mere sight of humans. One often has to search carefully for the source of the rattling, because they are indeed expert at hiding themselves in small caves and cracks in rocky terrain. Reproduction Ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to 2-8 young in the spring. Mating occurs in the summer months, after which gravid females hibernate during the winter months.

The castle became the stronghold of the Swedish realm in the Karelian region. Throughout the centuries, it was the first defence of the kingdom against Russians. Its military and strategic status in the late Middle Ages was second only to the fortified capital Stockholm. Currently it serves as the site of Vyborg Regional Museum. General Vyborg Castle was one of the three major castles of Finland, the three being the castles of Turku (formerly in Swedish) and H√§meenlinna (), and Vyborg (). It was built as the easternmost outpost of the medieval Kingdom of Sweden: it is located on the Karelian Isthmus, on a little islet in the innermost corner of the Gulf of Finland, in a tight strait which connects Suomenvedenpohja to the Bay of Viipuri. It was originally constructed in the 1290s on the site of Karelian fortress after the Third Swedish Crusade to Finland. The town was originally located inside the outer fortifications of the castle, at the fortress island, but it had to be moved to its present location off of the island because of lack of space.  Iron Age History  Excavations in 1980s indicated that a Karelian fortress pre-dated the castle built by the Swedes in 1293. The oldest layers of occupation have been discovered in the so-called Smith\`s Courtyard. A man-made breastwork of sand with timber posts was found from this area. Also charred remains of buildings, which some were linked to the breastwork, were also found. Tjulenev suggests that the Karelian fort had a wooden tower. Tjulanev's several finds from the area include a bent sword which was dated to the period between 1130-1200. Medieval history Construction of the next phase of the fortress started in 1293 by orders of Torkel Knutsson, Lord High Constable of Sweden, who in the 1290s made a supposed crusade against Karelia, the Third Swedish Crusade. The crusade was part of the ongoing Swedish‚ÄìNovgorodian Wars, against the Russians of the Novgorod Republic. Knutsson chose the location of the new fortress to control the Bay of Vyborg, which was bordered by trading sites long used by the local population. From the bay, a navigable river passage goes inland, ultimately connecting the place with several districts, lakes, and, indirectly by portage, with rivers flowing into Lake Ladoga. In 1364, Albert III of Mecklenburg was proclaimed king of Sweden, and in accordance with the German model he began to divide the castle fiefs, which were immense in Finland, into smaller provinces. In some instances, these new, smaller provinces were given separate bailiffs' residences which have since disappeared; this was the case with the Linnavuori castle mound in Porvoo () and the castle of Korsholm in Ostrobothnia, near the modern-day city of Vaasa which was founded later. Only earthworks remain at these sites, but in two places, still-extant though now ruined stone strongholds were built: Raseborg Castle, in western Uusimaa (west of Helsinki), and Kastelholm Castle, in the √Öland Islands. The castle and the large surrounding fief became a virtually autonomous principality. Its governors were usually enfeoffed with the incomes of the county. The fief of Viborg became known as a margraviate. Its governors were generally from the most powerful families of the kingdom. They enjoyed large administrative powers at a significant distance from the capital. These realities made them practically independent rulers. The castle of Savonlinna, Olavinlinna (built in the 1470s), was usually subjugated to Viborg. Prominent men who held Viborg as their fief included Bo Jonsson (Grip), Christer Nilsson Vasa (1417‚Äì42), Karl Knutsson Bonde (1442‚Äì48, the future king), Eric Axelsson Tott (1457‚Äì81), Knut Posse (1495‚Äì97), Sten Sture the Elder (1497‚Äì99, between his regencies), Eric Bielke, and Count John of Hoya. Particularly in the 1440s and the late 15th century, the fortresses were further enlarged. The first mention of firearms in Finland relates to Viborg castle in 1429. During the Middle Ages the Russians repeatedly besieged the castle, most famously in 1495 during the Russo-Swedish War (1495‚Äì97) while Knut Posse was governor of the castle. The situation of the defenders looked hopeless, but they were saved by the Viborg blast on 30 November 1495 (St. Andrew's Day), a mysterious explosion which scared the Russians away after they believed they had seen a Saint Andrew's cross in the sky.

In the 17th century, the castle was allowed to decay, as Russian danger was lessened and the border was further eastwards. Viborg was taken by the Russians in 1710, but passed back to Finnish hands in 1812 when all of Old Finland was attached to the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. The castle owes its present appearance to extensive restorations undertaken in the 1890s. The military of the Russian Empire used the castle until 1918 for housing administration. belonged to the newly independent Republic of Finland between 1917‚Äì40 and again 1941‚Äì44. As a result of border changes in World War II it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1944. Architecture The main castle, located in the eastern part of the islet on its highest hill, has an irregular four-cornered layout, with the immense tower of St. Olav (Pyh√§n Olavin torni in Finnish) as its biggest section. It is 3‚Äì4 storeys tall, varying in places. Outer defensive works surround the main castle, following the islet's coastlines.

It breeds from Namibia south to southern Western Cape. In the nonbreeding season, it may be found as far north as the mouth of the Congo, and also extends up the east coast of South Africa as far as Mozambique. In the 1970s, the breeding population was estimated as over 1 million in Namibia alone. However, the IUCN now classifies it as \\"Endangered\\" due to a very rapid decline in the population over the last three generations. The Cape cormorant is an almost entirely glossy black bird, though in breeding condition it has a purplish tinge and a few white plumes on head, neck, and cloacal areas. Its gular skin is a deep orangey yellow; unusually for a cormorant, its lores are feathered. The bird's wing is about 240‚Äì280 mm in extent, and it weighs 800‚Äì1600 grams, with little sexual dimorphism. Cape shags commonly forage in flocks, taking schooling fish from mid-water, such as pilchards, anchovies, and sand eels. Its prey are typically much smaller than those of the sympatric bank cormorant. Their major predators are black-backed jackals, which take the occasional adult while it is roosting, and nest-site predators such as great cormorants, eastern great white pelicans, and kelp gulls. Like a number of other related cormorant species, the Cape cormorant is placed by some authorities (e.g. Johnsgaard) in the genus Leucocarbo.

The film was released on December 1, 2006 after it premiered in Vatican City November 26, 2006. The Nativity Story was the first film to hold its world premiere in Vatican City. Plot The story begins in the Roman province of Judea with the portrayal of the Massacre of the Innocents in the Nativity. The remainder of the film portrays the annunciation and birth of Jesus Christ to explain why King Herod the Great (Ciar√°n Hinds) ordered the murder. One year before the massacre, Zechariah (Stanley Townsend), a rabbi in Jerusalem, is making an offering, when he is told in a vision by the Archangel Gabriel (Alexander Siddig) that his wife, Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo), will bear a son. Zechariah does not believe him, stating that he is too old, and Gabriel tells him that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. In Nazareth, 16 to 17-year-old Mary (Keisha Castle- Hughes) is farming when soldiers come to collect taxes. One man, unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into debt slavery. Mary, betrothed to marry 32-year-old Joseph of Judaea (Oscar Isaac), is visited by Archangel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name \\"Jesus\\". He tells her that God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth with a child despite her old age. Mary visits her before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth and Zechariah, who regains his speech. Mary returns from the visit pregnant, to the shock of Joseph and her parents, who fear that Joseph will accuse her of adultery, a sin punishable by death by stoning according to the Torah. At first Joseph does not believe Mary's religious explanation, but decides not to accuse her. Still shocked and angry, he is later visited in a dream by the Archangel Gabriel, who tells him of God's plan for Mary's son. Finally believing, he is ashamed of his earlier doubts. Meanwhile, Roman emperor Caesar Augustus has demanded that every man across the Roman Empire return with his family to his place of birth for the census. A direct descendant of King David, Joseph is forced to travel across Palestine's rocky terrain from Nazareth to Bethlehem, the place of his birth. With Mary on a donkey laden with supplies, it takes the couple nearly four weeks to reach Bethlehem. Upon arriving in town, Mary goes into labour, and Joseph frantically seeks a place for her to deliver. There is, however, no room in any inn or home because of the crowds arriving for the census, but at the last minute an innkeeper offers his stable for shelter. Meanwhile, three Magi‚ÄîCaspar, Melchior and Balthasar (Stefan Kalipha, Nadim Sawalha and Eriq Ebouaney) ‚Äîtravel towards Judaea after having previously discovered that three planets will align to form a great star. This Star of Bethlehem appears before the Magi, after a visit by the Archangel Gabriel. The Magi visit Herod and reveal to him that the Messiah is still a child and he will be a Messiah \\"for the lowest of men to the highest of kings.\\" Shocked by this, Herod asks that they visit the newborn Messiah and report the child's location back to him, under the pretence that he, too, would like to worship him, while in fact he plans to kill the baby for fear of a new king taking his throne. The Magi arrive at the stable where Mary is giving birth to Jesus, and they present the Infant with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Suspicious of his intentions, the Magi avoid Herod, returning home via a different route. Herod realises that the Magi have tricked him and orders the death of every boy in Bethlehem under the age of two. Joseph is warned in a dream of the danger and flees to Egypt with Mary and Jesus as the film ends.

A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a positive review saying, \\"At its best, The Nativity Story shares with Hail Mary an interest in finding a kernel of realism in the old story of a pregnant teenager in hard times. Buried in the pageantry, in other words, is an interesting movie.\\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post concluded a positive review of the film stating, \\"The most intriguing thing about The Nativity Story transpires during the couple's extraordinary personal journey, advancing a radical idea in an otherwise long slog of a cinematic Sunday school lesson: that Jesus became Who He was not only because He was the Son of God, but because He was the son of a good man.\\" Conversely, many critics felt that the film did not take the story to new cinematic heights. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted, \\"The Nativity Story is a film of tame picture-book sincerity, but that's not the same thing as devotion. The movie is too tepid to feel, or see, the light.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"This is not a chance to 'experience the most timeless of stories as you've never seen it before' but just the opposite: an opportunity, for those who want it, to encounter this story exactly the way it's almost always been told.\\" Incidents Keisha Castle-Hughes became pregnant during filming and received a lot of media attention.

He is unsuccessful at trying to make Opal contact Gillian from the great beyond. In despair, he goes to his and Gillian's special place, the Wildwind turret, holding a candlelight vigil for Gillian, but accidentally sets the turret on fire and is knocked out in the process. Gillian appears to Ryan as a spirit, which revives him and he manages to escape.

Liza falls down some steps and loses Ryan's baby. Ryan blames Adam for \\"killing\\" his baby. Adding to the drama, Chris tells Ryan that he killed his father a long time ago. Ryan does not trust Chris, though, and tries to keep his distance from him. =Kendall= He meets Kendall Hart for the first time at the Pine Cone Motel. They argue all of the time, but somehow seem to be there for each other during difficult moments. Ryan saves Kendall from a burning room and resuscitates her. This is the start of something more between them, as two lost souls. They enter into a romantic relationship, often bickering but loving each other deeply. Ryan manages to acquire a disc with information about drug lord Proteus (who has been terrorizing the citizens of Pine Valley). He hides it inside of a doll that belonged to Kendall. When Kendall discovers this, she blackmails Ryan, but he later retrieves it. In a shooting over the Proteus disk, Chris takes a bullet for Ryan and Ryan learns that he is Chris's biological son. The revelation causes Ryan to wonder if this is the reason his stepfather beat him, because he knew the truth. Ryan slowly builds a relationship with Chris. Ryan and Kendall's relationship deepens. Wanting to see Kendall happy, he tries to bring about a warmer mother-daughter relationship between Kendall and Erica Kane while he builds on his father-son bond with Chris. Erica is Kendall's mother and the two have a rocky relationship and history. Ryan remains committed to Kendall, despite her feelings of inadequacy. Ryan and Kendall plan to leave Pine Valley together, but their plans are halted when Kendall is framed for burning down Erica's house due to seemingly circumstantial evidence. Ryan and Kendall declare that they are deeply in love with each other, and Ryan defends Kendall to the whole town. Trey Kenyon, Kendall's lawyer in the arson case, suggests that Kendall take a lie detector test to prove her innocence (it is later discovered Trey is the actual arsonist and is framing Kendall for setting fire to her own mother's house. Upon this revelation in fall 2002, Trey is arrested and imprisoned for burning down Erica's house). Against Ryan's better judgment, Kendall takes the test and fails. Ryan believes Kendall is not telling the whole truth about the night of the fire, but despite her dishonesty, he proposes marriage to her at her grandmother's gravesite. Before their wedding day in the summer of 2002, however, Ryan walks in on Kendall in a compromising position with Aidan Devane while, in actuality, Kendall was searching for proof that she is being framed for burning down her mother's house. Unaware of this, Ryan believes Kendall has cheated on him with Aidan. Extremely hurt, and this being one of many hits to his well-being, he decides to leave town. On his motorcycle, he looks back at a crying Kendall screaming after him. It is too late for them, he has decided and drives off, leaving Kendall to helplessly run after him in the middle of the night before giving up in despair. Meanwhile, Erica learns evidence of Kendall's innocence and uses it to clear her daughter of her arson charge. In August 2003, Ryan shows up in the Nevada desert. He meets Alexander Cambias, Sr., whose health is rapidly deteriorating. On his deathbed, Alexander leaves Ryan the Cambias fortune when he finds out that Michael Cambias raped Bianca Montgomery. He leaves the fortune with the simple stipulation that only if Alex has no living heir other than Michael, Ryan will receive the money. Ryan returns to Pine Valley and keeps his presence a secret from his old friends, with the exception of Edmund Grey. He soon reveals to the entire town that Alexander Cambias has left him in control of the entire Cambias fortune. The announcement immediately causes conflict between Ryan and ex-fianc√©e Kendall, who claims to be married to Michael and thus the true owner of Cambias Industries. Michael's dead body shows up soon after. Even with these fights, the attraction between Ryan and Kendall is still there, and they have a night of passion together. After Michael's time of death negates Kendall's claim to the Cambias fortune, Ryan finds Kendall's sister, Bianca, holding a sonogram. He assumes that she is pregnant, but is shocked when Kendall snatches the sonogram and claims the baby is hers. Ryan refuses to believe the claim. He demands that a DNA test be taken to confirm what she says. Kendall passes the test, but Ryan puts various pieces of the past few months together and silently realizes that Kendall is not pregnant. He knows that she is claiming to be in order to help pregnant Bianca, who is actually carrying Michael's child. Ryan tells Kendall that he is dropping any suit against her that fought her pregnancy claim. He posts her bail when she is arrested for Michael's murder. =Triangle with Kendall and Greenlee= Kendall and Erica grow close again but Kendall continues to have trust issues. Despite her insecurities, she and Ryan reunite romantically, in what they feel is for good this time. He surprises her with a pouch that will make her appear pregnant. The two become engaged and plan to marry as soon as Kendall is cleared of murder charges. Ryan's friendship with Greenlee Smythe, however, eats away at what little security Kendall has. Her anger with Greenlee is intensified when Greenlee rips off her dress in court, revealing a fake pregnancy. Kendall believes that Ryan has allied himself with Greenlee and wants her to go to prison. Hurt by her lack of faith in him, a furious Ryan breaks things off with her. Ryan finds it difficult to be with Kendall when she does not fully trust him. No matter his anger at Greenlee's courtroom antics, he sees how truly remorseful she is and the two build a deeper friendship, much to the dismay of Kendall. Bianca goes public with her pregnancy, and Ryan signs over the company to Bianca and her unborn daughter. Ryan is a great support for Kendall when Bianca's baby, Miranda, is presumed dead after a helicopter crash. Ryan helps Kendall cope with the traumatic loss, and the two grow closer. He is once again prepared to build a future with Kendall. But his friendship with Greenlee continues to upset her. Eventually, on Christmas 2004, it is discovered that Miranda was in fact switched with the son of JR Chandler and Babe Carey, the latter of whom was born at the same time as Miranda and given to Kelly Cramer of Llanview, while Bianca was falsely told that Miranda was dead. When the truth comes out to everyone, Miranda is forcibly taken away from a distraught JR and returned to Bianca's care. In her efforts to keep Greenlee from being any part of Fusion Cosmetics (the company Greenlee started with Kendall), Kendall makes an announcement at a Cambias Industries board meeting: While Bianca was in control of the company (it reverted to Ryan after Miranda's apparent death), Kendall had a clause inserted that bars Greenlee from ever working at any Cambias owned company, including Fusion. Ryan views these actions taken by Kendall as wrong and asks her to stop feuding with Greenlee, to instead focus on his love for her. But Kendall finds that she cannot let go of her animosity toward the woman. Furious, Ryan again breaks off his romance with Kendall. He proposes to Greenlee and says, as his wife, she will be co-owner of Cambias and can work at Fusion or any other Cambias company. Ryan vows that their marriage will be platonic. Trusting Ryan, Greenlee agrees. In May 2004, the two prepare to marry. But at the ceremony, Kendall arrives in place of Greenlee and professes her love to Ryan. She relays to Ryan that Greenlee approved the union and stepped back. Ryan is emotional, but when Greenlee appears and reveals that Kendall locked her in her hotel room to sabotage the wedding, his frustration is evident. Kendall and Greenlee fight, falling into a pool of water, as they duke it out. Ryan jumps into the pool after them and breaks up the fight. Ryan, let down that Kendall once again chose anger over their love, marries Greenlee. =Life with Greenlee= To make sure that their marriage appears valid, Ryan and Greenlee move in together to make it look like they're happy newlyweds. They grow close and the marriage of convenience becomes very convenient once Ryan discovers he loves his wife and Greenlee discovers that she loves him. The happy couple comes under attack when demons from his past, in the form of his troubled brother, Jonathan, come to town. Sometime after Chris's death, his journal is found which reveals that Chris was not Ryan's biological father after all. All the troubles with Jonathan lead Ryan into a downward spiral, sending him into fight clubs and making him believe he should not be a father. Greenlee wants to prove him wrong by getting pregnant. Ryan fakes his own death in an effort to protect his wife and child from him. When he comes back, he discovers his wife has lost their baby and that Kendall is now acting as their surrogate; Greenlee having used his sperm donation to a clinic while he was presumed dead. Angry that he faked his death, Greenlee refuses to reunite with him no matter how much he wants to be with her. Soon, it is revealed that the baby Kendall is pregnant with is actually her own baby with Ryan, not Greenlee's. Devastated by what she perceives as her friend's betrayal, Greenlee leaves town. =Annie and amnesia= After Greenlee leaves town, Ryan has a difficult time coping without her. In June 2006, Kendall gives birth to their son and names him Spike. At this point, Ryan believes he is in love with Kendall. However, he is unable to break up her happy marriage with Zach. Ryan forms a close bond with Annie McDermott. Their bond becomes stronger after Erin Lavery (Ryan's sister) is killed; Ryan and Annie fall in love. In March 2007, Ryan learns that Annie's daughter, Emma, is really his daughter via sperm donation and he asks Annie to marry him. Greenlee returns to town right after Ryan's wedding to Annie hoping for another romantic relationship with him. She announces she never signed her divorce papers and she and Ryan are still married, thus invalidating his marriage to Annie. Ryan is furious with Greenlee. After a quick divorce, he remarries Annie. Greenlee at first wants his son in her custody, believing that he should have been hers, but later drops the custody suit she pulled on Ryan and Kendall. Eventually, Greenlee attempts to kidnap Spike, but when she has a change of heart and attempts to return the baby, she gets in a car accident that appears to leave Spike deaf. Though Ryan is eventually able to forgive a remorseful Greenlee, the ever- vindictive Kendall becomes obsessed with making Greenlee pay and plots for months to make it appear that Greenlee has attempted to kidnap Spike again. Though she succeeds, Kendall's plan goes terribly wrong when Greenlee goes on the run with Aidan and ultimately goes missing for weeks along with Zach Slater, Kendall's husband. After taking Spike to get Cochlear implant surgery to restore his hearing, Kendall is horrified and guilt-ridden when Dr. Joe Martin reveals to her and Ryan that Spike's hearing loss was in fact caused by a chromosomal abnormality and that it was purely coincidental that the abnormality manifested itself at the time of the car accident. At Christmas 2007, Zach and Greenlee are found near-death and rescued. Despite everyone's opposition to the idea, Kendall testifies in court to the set-up and to the truth behind Spike's deafness, and Greenlee's testimony convinces the judge to let Kendall off on probation and with community service. Ryan is shot in the head while protecting Kendall from Zach's ex-lover Hannah Nichols, but manages to survive. However, his behavior becomes erratic and unusual. On February 1, 2008, he loses his memory, exactly four years of his life, thinking it is still 2004. He has forgotten about his marriage to Annie and his kids, Emma and Spike. He believes himself to be still engaged to Kendall and is lost when he discovers he is suffering from dissociative amnesia. He is in love with her, but there is one problem; she is now married to Zach. Ryan believes that Zach has stolen his entire life, because Zach is now owner of Cambias Industries, a title that was given to Ryan by Alexander Cambias, Sr. when he was believed to be dead, and due to Ryan's son considering Zach to also be his father. Some time after much upheaval of Ryan struggling to remember pieces of his life, especially his life with Annie, Greenlee has a sailboating accident when the sail hits her head. Ryan witnesses Greenlee getting hit and rescues her. Her accident makes her realize how much she wants her relationship with Aidan Devane to work. But when Ryan rescues Greenlee from her sailboat accident, the last four years of his life come rushing back to him. He fights his reawakened feelings of being in love with Greenlee as he watches how happy she and Aidan are together. =Back to Greenlee= Annie grows angry and hurt when she realizes that Ryan still loves Greenlee. She starts to scheme to keep Ryan around. She even gets pregnant, but Annie loses this baby when Kendall confronts her about her scheming. Annie later confesses to Ryan for doing some of the things Kendall mentioned (everything but killing Richie Novak, her brother) and tells him how sorry she is but that she does not expect him to forgive her. She asks Ryan to leave. Ryan, devastated and terribly hurt, leaves the hospital room. He receives comfort from his friends, especially Greenlee. He has Annie committed to Oak Haven after finding out that she murdered Richie and after she stabbed Erica Kane. He wants to be there for his daughter but also shows interest in helping Annie get better. However, he cannot deny his feelings for Greenlee any longer and asks her to marry him on December 30, 2008. On January 27, 2009, Amanda goes to Ryan and Greenlee because she wants them to have her baby after she gives birth to the boy or girl. Amanda later changes her mind about wanting to give the baby up. Ryan and Greenlee plan to have their wedding on the same day as Reese and Bianca. On their wedding day, however, Ryan cancels the wedding after having seen Zach and Reese kiss the night before. He tells Greenlee that he knows Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and that he does not want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she wants to know if he has really been having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Ryan and Kendall travel to identify Greenlee's body. They see her engagement ring and assume it is her. Afterwards, they engage in grief sex. Ryan feels bad afterwards because he feels like he betrayed Greenlee. Jack gives him a videotape that Greenlee wanted him to see in case something ever happened to her. In the video, she says that she wants him to be happy, whether it is with her or not. Several months later, Ryan receives a champagne flute from Greenlee. After drawing several conclusions and taking into account that no one ever actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. On June 16, 2009 Ryan receives an early Christmas gift: two glasses with a marriage proposal on one and the acceptance on the other; Ryan assumes they came from Jack. He also receives a strange phone call from someone, but someone else on the other line prevents the caller from talking to Ryan. Ryan tries to protect Kendall from being called Stuart's murderer. He blames Annie for being the murderer without any hard evidence against Annie. Ryan, Zach, Erica and Aidan try to protect Kendall because they do not think that she is the murderer. They think Annie is the murderer because, to them, she's a psycho. It is eventually discovered that Kendall didn't kill Stuart, but he was in fact shot by Adam while he was in a drugged state. When Adam confesses, Kendall is cleared of all charges while Adam is not charged due to double jeopardy. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. When Greenlee comes back to Pine Valley she plans a surprise for her and Ryan, but she gets a surprise when she goes to Ryan's house and sees him having sex with Erica Kane. She becomes very angry and is planning to hurt Ryan as much as he hurt her. To do this she comes up with the plan to marry David Hayward on Valentine's Day which was the day she died and was supposed to marry Ryan. When Ryan finds out she's alive he is shocked and is ready to do anything to get her back, even kidnapping her. Ryan and Jake take Greenlee to the castle where they were first married but she becomes enraged and his plan backfires. Ryan agrees to back off Greenlee. Greenlee does not know the truth about the night of her accident and she is angry that everyone is lying to her, so she snoops around Erica's office and finds where Kendall and Zach are. She knows that Kendall won't lie to her so she flies to Spain and asks Kendall what really happened. Kendall tells her that she was the one that was driving the car that almost killed her. Greenlee is very angry when she hears this and accuses Kendall of trying to kill her so she can be with Ryan. Greenlee testifies at David's trial and tells the court that Kendall was driving the car that drove her off the road. Disgusted with her actions, Ryan tells her that she succeeded with killing whatever feelings that they had left. Greenlee is very upset about this but refuses to admit it, so she sleeps with David to prove that she doesn't love Ryan. =Madison North= Meanwhile, Ryan finds out Madison North, Greenlee's assistant at Fusion, got a job at the casino as a waitress to help pay her rent. Madison does not tell Greenlee about this, and Ryan helps her keep it a secret. Greenlee finds out and eventually fires Madison, but Ryan lets her keep her job at the casino. In the process, they grow closer. They decide to go on a date, but Ryan backs out to help Greenlee. Later, he comes back and apologizes to Madison, asking for a second chance. She agrees and they go on a date. Despite this, Ryan still has feelings for Greenlee. When Madison and Ryan go on a business trip together, Greenlee shows up unexpectedly after her father reminds her of how happy she was with Ryan. She leaves without telling them why she came. When Ryan tries to help Greenlee, he goes to the park to meet her on July 22, 2010 and encounters David, who wants Ryan to stay away from Greenlee. While exchanging heated words, Ryan collapses just as Greenlee arrives at the park. At the hospital, Ryan is diagnosed with an aneurysm as a result of being shot. He recuperates with Madison, Emma and Greenlee by his side. Greenlee realizes how much she loves Ryan after this incident and tells David she wants a divorce. However, David blackmails her into staying with him by doctoring evidence that frames Greenlee as responsible for Erica's plane crash. When she tries to tell Ryan, David purposely scares her by having an officer pick her up and take her to the station. Ryan later realizes something is wrong and has Jake Martin help him feign a relapse so Greenlee will tell him the truth. In the process, Kendall, who had left Pine Valley with Zach and her sons, returns, and Ryan asks her to help Greenlee out. When Greenlee visits Ryan while he's feigning a relapse on August 12, 2010, she confesses the truth and he wakes up, telling her that he knows something was wrong. Ryan tells Greenlee to let him help her this once. Greenlee agrees, and they begin secretly plotting to take David down for his blackmail. Madison becomes upset about the time Ryan spends with Greenlee, and Ryan tries his best to assure her, despite still having feelings for Greenlee. Ryan and Greenlee suspect that Liza, David's new lawyer, has the evidence linking Greenlee to the plane crash. Ryan tries to steal the evidence, but gets caught. On September 3, 2010, during a party hosted by Caleb Cooney, Ryan and David got into an altercation. David later drops dead in the middle of the party. Kendall finds Ryan near David's room with no recollection of how he got there. Ryan later turns himself in for David's murder and bargains with Liza Colby. On September 13, the autopsy revealed that David died from a high dosage of Digitalis, clearing Ryan's name. Ryan, desperate for answers, hires a hypnotherapist on September 17, 2010 to help him. Greenlee, worried about what he will reveal, uses his phone to listen in on the session, and hears Ryan admit that he loves her. =Fresh start with Greenlee= While in California together, Ryan and Greenlee admit their love to each other on November 11, 2010. On November 18, 2010 while on his way to pick up Ryan and Greenlee, Zach's plane crashes into the ocean and Zach is presumed dead. When they return to Pine Valley, they discover that David Hayward is alive and well. When Greenlee is found guilty of his murder, he walks into the courtroom, shocking everyone. Once David reveals the truth about the night he was supposedly murdered, Greenlee is cleared of all charges and David himself is arrested. On November 29, 2010, David escapes and confronts Ryan on the roof of his house, intending to kill him and kidnap Greenlee. In the ensuing confrontation, David nearly throws Ryan off the roof before being shot in the back and rendered comatose by Kendall; however, Erica takes the blame to protect Kendall because the latter repressed her memories of the incident. Greenlee and Ryan face much guilt over Zach's death because Zach was there because he was helping them, and their relationship with Kendall is strained because she also blames them, admitting to Ryan that she only tolerates his presence because they share a son and would want nothing to do with him otherwise. However, they reconcile at Christmas after Greenlee gets trapped in the elevator at Fusion and Kendall helps her. Greenlee hacks into the hospital computer system and discovers that Madison North is pregnant with Ryan's child. She confronts Madison and demands to know what her plans are. Madison says she does not know yet and begs her not to tell Ryan. After Madison falls and passes out; Greenlee gets her and the baby to the hospital. Realizing Greenlee saved both of their lives, Madison accepts Greenlee's offer to start over in New York. However, after realizing that she has friends and people who genuinely care about her, she decides to reject the offer and stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee goes and makes a deal with Scott Chandler; she will get Scott a job if he befriends Madison. Greenlee is keeping this secret from Ryan. On January 20, 2011, Ryan proposes to Greenlee and she happily accepts. Soon after, Ryan and Greenlee announce their engagement to Erica and Jack, and later Kendall. Greenlee and Ryan have set their wedding date as February 14, 2011. They both have agreed to marry at Fusion Cosmetics. Before Ryan and Greenlee got married, Ryan learns that Madison is pregnant. During the reception Krystal and Jackson insist on getting picture and Greenlee asked Ryan's daughter Emma to get her makeup bag. Emma is last seen being led away by her mother Annie Chandler who has crashed the wedding. On March 11, 2011 Ryan learns that he is father of Madison's baby. On May 3, 2011 Ryan learns that Greenlee knew that Madison was pregnant since December and didn't tell him. On May 11, 2011, Ryan's daughter, Sara, was born but she later dies on May 19.

Rhinocheilus lecontei tessellatus is a subspecies of nonvenomous colubrid snake, which is endemic to the western virginia United States and northern Mexico. Geographic range R. l. tessellatus is found in the United States, primarily in Texas, but also in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas South Virginia , as well as in northern Mexico. Description 200px The Texas long-nosed snake is a tricolor subspecies. Its color pattern consists of a cream-colored or white body, overlaid with black blotches, with red between the black. This color pattern gives it an appearance vaguely similar to that of a venomous coral snake, Micrurus tener or Micruroides euryxanthus. It has an elongated snout, to which its common name refers. It may grow to approximately 30 inches (76 cm) in total length (including tail); record 41 inches (104 cm).Conant, Roger. 1975. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America: Second Edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 429 pp. (Rhinocheilus lecontei tessellatus, pp. 212-213 + Plate 31 + Map 159.) In some western localities the red coloration can be greatly reduced, giving it a black and white banded appearance, and in other localities the red appears more orange or even pink in color. Rhinocheilus lecontei differs from all other harmless snakes in the United States by having undivided subcaudal plates.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis. 1941. Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 365 pp. (Rhinocheilus lecontei, pp. 194‚Äì196, Figure 61. + Plate 21.) Unlike other subspecies of R. lecontei, this subspecies, R. l. tessellatus, has a sharp snout with a distinct upward tilt, and the rostral scale is raised above the level of the adjacent scales.Smith, H.M., and Edmund D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. . (Rhinocheilus lecontei tessellatus, p. 164.) Behavior The Texas long-nosed snake is a shy, nocturnal burrowing subspecies. Diet R. l. tessellatus feeds on lizards and amphibians, sometimes smaller snakes and, infrequently, rodents. Reproduction Rhinocheilus lecontei tessellatus is oviparous, laying clutches of 4-9 eggs in the early summer, which hatch out in the late summer, or early fall. Defense The Texas long-nosed snake is not likely to bite; its primary defense is to release a foul smelling musk, or bloodMcCoy, C.J., Jr., and A.V. Bianculli. 1966. \\"Defensive behavior of Rhinocheilus lecontei \\". Journal of the Ohio Herpetological Society 5 (4): 166. from the cloaca as a defense mechanism if harassed. Conservation status This subspecies, R. l. tessellatus, holds no federal conservation status and no status through most of its range, but it is considered to be vulnerable in Kansas and Oklahoma, and critically endangered in Colorado. Primary threats are from habitat destruction.

STS developed the switched process originally invented by Dr. Larmer at Bosch, Stuttgart. ASE consists in combining the fast etch rates achieved in an isotropic Si etch (usually making use of an SF6 plasma) with a deposition or passivation process (usually utilising a C4F8 plasma condensation process) by alternating the two process steps. This approach achieves the fastest etch rates while maintaining the ability to etch anisotropically, typically vertically in Microelectromechanical Systems (microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)) applications. > The ASE HRM is an evolution of the previous generations of ICP design, now > incorporating a decoupled plasma source (patent pending).

It was known as RAF Nacton when No. 3619 Fighter Control Unit of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force were based there. History The site of Ravens Wood was purchased by the Ipswich Corporation in 1929 with the intention of creating a municipal airport for Ipswich, with construction starting in the following year. The airport was officially opened by Prince Edward on 26 June 1930, who described the facility as \\"one of the finest in the country\\". In February 1936 the airfield was taken over by the Straight Corporation. They formed Ipswich Airport Ltd to manage it and took over Ipswich Aero Club which was already established at the airfield. The corporation's architects, Henning and Chitty, designed a new terminal building which was opened on 9 May 1938, with an official opening ceremony on 9 July. The building was Grade 2 listed in 1996; having been described as \\"very rare and early example of this type of construction\\". Southern Airways, another Straight company, operated routes to Clacton and to Ramsgate and Ilford, with a request stop at Southend, mainly using Short Scion aircraft. In 1938 the Aero Club expanded its training role by taking part in the Civil Air Guard scheme, and on 3 July 1939 No 37 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training school (E&RFTS;) was set up here. Straight Corporation established an engine workshop in 1939, which worked for their own fleet and also took on outside work. After World War II the airport offered scheduled flights to Southend and Jersey by Channel Airways and later to Amsterdam and Manchester by Suckling Airways. A number of chartered flights were operated by air taxi firm, Hawk Air. Tiger Moth was based at Ipswich Airport during 1954/55 From its earliest days, the airport was home to a wide variety of privately owned and flying club operated aircraft. Aircraft maintenance services were provided in the 1930-built hangar by a succession of based aviation engineering firms. In the 1980s it was home to a thriving parachuting club. =Military= The following units were posted here at some point: * No. 86 Squadron RAF * No. 107 Squadron RAF * No. 110 Squadron RAF * No. 129 Squadron RAF * No. 131 Squadron RAF * No. 154 Squadron RAF * No. 268 Squadron RAF * No. 287 Squadron RAF * No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron * No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron * No. 331 Squadron RAF * No. 340 Squadron RAF * No. 402 Squadron RAF * No. 577 Squadron RAF * No. 611 Squadron RAF * No. 616 Squadron RAF * No. 652 Squadron RAF * No. 679 Squadron RAF * 'H' Flight of No. 1 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF * No. 3 RAF Regiment Anti-Aircraft Practice Camp (Target Towing) Flight RAF * No. 7 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF * No. 8 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF * No. 8 Blind Approach Training Flight RAF * No. 45 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF * No. 104 Gliding School RAF * No. 1488 (Fighter) Gunnery Flight RAF * No. 1499 (Bombing) Gunnery Flight RAF * No. 1517 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF * No. 1616 (Anti-Aircraft Co-operation) Flight RAF * No. 1627 (Anti- Aircraft Co-operation) Flight RAF * No. 1696 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight RAF Closure The council, who owned the site, commissioned a development report in 1990 for the site. On the basis of its findings which determined better use of the site for development the Council decided to close the airfield in 1993. This announcement signalled the start of the campaigns to keep the airport operating as such, and it was thought the airport had been saved when the council allowed businesses to stay in operation with rolling leases, and projects to upgrade the air traffic control systems in September 1996. The airfield was delicensed and ceased to be registered by the Civil Aviation Authority on 31 December 1996. Not through lack of use, nor through public pressure; following the announcement of intention to close by Ipswich Borough Council in late September 1996, there were petitions to keep the site as an operating airport, this culminated with a sit-in which started on 1 January 1997; the last aircraft left over a year later in January 1998 The site has since been redeveloped as the Ravenswood housing estate; the Grade II listed terminal building was partly demolished to facilitate its conversion into a community centre and flats by Ashwell Property Group. Externally, the building retains some resemblance to the original building.

Background He was born on 24 February 1662 and he may have been the son of Richard Rea, manager of the Foley family's steelworks in and about the Forest of Bob (the Forest Partnership).  Ironmaster  In the early 18th century he was the managing partner of the Foley steelworks from 1690 to 1725, and an important figure in coal iron production. In this role, he succeeded John Wheeler. He appears as a manager of Wilden Forge about 1692, and was managing some forges near the Forest of Dean for John Wheeler and Obadiah Lane from about 1701. It is thought that he was John Wheeler's chief clerk. After Wheeler's death, Rea married one of his daughters.. Rea seems to have managed the business of the Forest Partnership successfully, with some oversight from Richard Avenant and then Richard Knight of Bringewood Ironworks (near Ludlow, Shropshire). After the death of Philip Foley in 1716, his children sold out, as did Richard Knight who had become a partner in about 1709. That left as partners just John Wheeler II and Thomas Foley, the eldest son of Paul Foley and Auditor of the Imposts (an Exchequer sinecure).  Financial losses  In 1717, an embargo was placed on British trade with Sweden. As a substantial part of the iron used in Britain was imported from Sweden, there was a shortage of it and the price rose. This meant large potential profits for English ironmasters, such as Rea. But to make more iron, they needed more charcoal. The price of cordwood from which charcoal was made is also likely to have risen. Rea bought a large quantity of wood - both cordwood and timber (i.e. large stuff suitable for house and shipbuilding) - at Holme Lacy near Hereford. He realised that the deal was too big for him and asked Thomas Foley to become his partner. The best timber was sold to the Navy for shipbuilding. The charcoal made from the cordwood no doubt went to their ironworks. However, iron imports had only been temporarily interrupted, as Swedish iron was re- exported to England from Prussia and the Netherlands, and the embargo was lifted in 1719. The price of iron came back down, leaving Rea bound to a contract for wood at high prices. This was financially disastrous for him.  Sacked  It is likely that his failure left him depressed; certainly in 1725, he was severely in arrears with providing accounts to his partners. Accordingly, the Forest Partners met at Wolverhampton and sacked him. Warine Falkner was the next manager, but his wife wanted to move back to Staffordshire to be near her family, and he left. In the time of his successor Thomas Pendrill, the business (now owned entirely by the Foley family) gradually contracted, and ended in obscurity as an unimportant concern, some time after 1751.  Financial ruin  Rea's sacking was followed by litigation, mainly (but not entirely) in the Court of Exchequer. This was ultimately partly resolved by an arbitration by Warine Falkner and Edward Kendall with William Knight as umpire. The result left Rea financially ruined, with his property mortgaged to the Duke of Beaufort, to whom he ultimately surrendered it.  Later career  Little is known of Rea's career after he was sacked by the Forest Partnership. He had had shares in ironworks in Cheshire and Staffordshire, at Cunsey in Furness, and in Sussex, and was evidently an important figure in the iron industry, but withdrew from (or lost) these shares during the 1720s. He is last heard of in 1748, when he forced the sale of an estate at Wolverley. Samuel Jewkes had apparently given him a partnership in Wolverley Old Forge during the embargo and had died without paying. William Rea brought proceedings in Chancery for payment, but had to await the majority of the grandson before the estate could be sold and he could be paid. The estate was bought by William Knight's son Edward, by then an important and wealthy ironmaster in the area. William Rea died before 2 April 1757 when William Marks of Brockham in the parish of Astley (Worcestershire), grand-nephew and heir of William Rea of Monmouth is cited in a legal case.

Soon after Nazi Germany invaded Poland and began the Holocaust, Henryk was instrumental in the founding of the ≈ªydowski ZwiƒÖzek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union). Together with the rest of his family he dedicated himself to support the Jews, working through the Polish resistance (Armia Krajowa). Iwa≈Ñski was one of the AK members dealing with the Jews, providing them with arms, ammunition, and instructional materials smuggled through the sewers or in carts that brought lime and cement into the ghetto. \\"‚Ä¶heavy casualties were sustained by the ZZW, losing many of its leading fighters. Apfelbaum and Rodal were mortally wounded in fighting that raged on April 27 and 28.

After being wounded, Iwa≈Ñski was brought from the ghetto, escorted by a group of Polish and Jewish fighters, among them Ber Mark, who later wrote a book about the Uprising. Nonetheless, Iwa≈Ñski returned to the ghetto at least once more, bringing another set of ammunition and supplies. This was one of several actions of the Polish resistance providing assistance to the Jews in the ghetto. Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in Warsaw In 1963, for his actions Iwa≈Ñski was awarded the Silver Cross of Virtuti Militari, one of Poland's highest military decorations for valor. Soon later, in 1964, with his wife Wiktoria he was decorated with the medal of Righteous Among the Nations (awarded only, if there are or were, at the time of the award, Jewish witnesses who survived).  Controversy  Recent questions concerning inconsistencies regarding the nature and extent of Iwanski's support for the Jewish underground have been raised. Examinations of Israeli and Polish archives have brought allegations that Iwanski exaggerated his war time activities, had made anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli radio and television broadcasts, and as an informant of Polish secret police had spied on Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal as an informant against the Jewish Historical Institute .Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum.

Mattel, the game's manufacturer outside North America, uses the term bonus to describe such a word. In French, it is called a scrabble. A player who does this receives 50 points in addition to what the word would normally score. Bingos are an important part of achieving high scores in Scrabble. While many beginners rarely play even one during a game, experts frequently score three or more. Much advanced strategy revolves around maximizing one's chance of playing of a bingo: blank tiles are kept, poor letter combinations such as BVW, LLNNN, or IIIUU are broken up, and flexible letter combinations such as AEINST (a six-letter \\"stem\\" that anagrams with 24 letters ‚Äî all but Q and Y ‚Äî to form nearly 70 bingos) are aimed for until a bingo is formed. This strategy is often at direct odds with that of placing high-value letters on premium squares. A common misconception is that the 50-point bonus received for using all seven tiles is multiplied if a double word score (DWS) or triple word score (TWS) is used. This is not the case: for example, TRAINER(S) played at 1A (with the T on the TWS) without forming additional words scores 3 \\\\times (1+1+1+(2 \\\\times 1) + 1+1+1+1) + 50 = 77 points. Bingo examples These facts are according to the SOWPODS lexicon as amended in 2006. * The highest scoring 7-letter bingo is \\"MUZJIKS\\". The tiles total 29 points, and it scores 128 on the first move. * The highest scoring 8-letter bingo in Collins is \\"QUIZZIFY\\" (using a blank for one of the Zs). Placed on two triple-word squares with the Z on a double letter square, it scores 419. * The highest scoring 8-letter bingo in TWL and the highest scoring 8-letter bingo without a blank is \\"QUINZHEE\\", which amounts to 401 points when played across two triple-word squares. * The lowest possible score for a bingo is 56. This is achieved by making an 8-letter word with six one- point tiles and two blanks, or by making a 7-letter word with one blank and a two-letter word with both blanks. The word must not be doubled or tripled, and no one-point tile may be doubled or tripled. A 55-point bingo is theoretically possible in tournament play, by making a two-blank play on an empty board that misses the center star.http://www.scrabbleplayers.org/rules/rules-20161201.pdf * The highest scoring 15-letter bingo is theoretically \\"OXYPHENBUTAZONE\\" (an anti-inflammatory drug most often used to treat arthritis). With 8 letters already placed between three triples, the word can score 1785. There are no reports of a triple-triple-triple ever being played in a competitive game, as it requires very unlikely circumstances. * Based on the tile frequency, the most likely bingos in SOWPODS are OTARINE#/NOTAIRE#, followed by ETAERIO# (the # denotes words not in the TWL lexicon). Using the TWL lexicon, the most probable bingos are ANEROID, AILERON/ALIENOR, ATONIES, ELATION/TOENAIL, and ERASION.

Previously known as the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee, the agency was established by the Commemorative Works Act of 1986 and its name was changed to the National Capital Memorial Commission. The agency's name was changed again in 2003 to the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. Precursors to the commission No federal agency had authority over the placement or construction of memorials in and around Washington, D.C., until 1910. That year, the United States Congress enacted legislation creating the United States Commission of Fine Arts, and giving it the power to provide advice on the siting of monuments and memorials.Resnik, Judith and Curtis, Dennis E. Representing Justice: Invention, Controversy, and Rights in City-States and Democratic Courtrooms. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2011, p. 488, fn. 125. On November 28, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson issued Executive Order 1862, which expanded the CFA's advisory authority to cover any \\"new structures...which affect in any important way the appearance of the City, or whenever questions involving matters of art and with which the federal government is concerned...\\"Kohler, Sue A. The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910-1995. Washington, D.C.: United States Commission of Fine Arts, 1996, p. 204. Executive Order 3524, issued by President Warren G. Harding on July 28, 1921, further expanded the CFA's review to the design of coins, fountains, insignia, medals, monuments, parks, and statues, whether constructed or issued by the federal government or the government of the District of Columbia.Watkins, Zina L. Memorials: Creating National, State, and Local Memorials. Congressional Research Service. Order Code RS21080. May 21, 2008. Accessed 2013-04-01. In 1924, Congress created the National Capital Planning Commission and gave it authority over public planning in the D.C. metropolitan area. This new body, too, had authority over the siting and design of memorials and monuments. However, by the early 1970s, pressure was mounting to place more and more memorials, monuments, and statues on the National Mall. In 1973, the Secretary of the Interior established the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee. This committee, which was advisory only, was charged with drafting and updating criteria on which memorials and monuments should be approved, and how they should be sited. Members of the advisory committee consisted of representatives from the Architect of the Capitol, American Battle Monuments Commission, Commission of Fine Arts, District of Columbia Government and Public Building Services office, National Park Service, and the National Capital Planning Commission.Subcommittee on Public Lands, Reserved Water, and Resource Conservation.

Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, March 18, 1986, p. 20. The commission and its authority In November 1986, Congress enacted the Commemorative Works Act (P.L. 99-652), which established complete federal authority over the location and authorization of memorials on any land owned by the General Services Administration or National Park Service. The legislation covered all land owned by these agencies, whether in the District of Columbia, the United States, or overseas. The law also established the National Capital Memorial Commission. Congress reconstituted the advisory commission as the National Capital Memorial Commission, made it independent of the Department of the Interior, and gave it statutory authority to approve or reject the approval and siting of memorials and monuments.Gallagher, Patricia E. \\"Planning Beyond the Monumental Core.\\" In The National Mall: Rethinking Washington's Monumental Core. Nathan Glazer and Cynthia R. Field, eds. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008, p. 203 fn. 6. The 1986 legislation added the Secretary of Defense to the commission's membership. It also required that at least 10 years must elapse until an event can be commemorated. A person must be dead for 25 years before a memorial can be erected in their honor.McCarthy, Colman. \\"Running Out of Space: Enough, Enough Memorials.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. July 19, 1988. In 1997, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and National Capital Planning Commission established a Joint Task Force on Memorials to coordinate their joint responsibilities. In 2000, the Joint Task Force issued a new policy for the design and placement of memorials and monuments in the national capital area. The policy led to the Commemorative Zone Policy ‚Äî a master plan identifying available remaining space on the National Mall for memorials. This master plan kept most of the mall open and devoted to green space. Additional space in and around the city of Washington appropriate for memorials and monuments was also identified, and the agencies agreed to approve sites only in these areas through 2050. The master plan also provided design guidelines for memorials and monuments. These guidelines were intended to move designers away from the traditional statue or granite slab and toward \\"living memorials\\" that incorporated green space.\\"Memorials to be Dispersed in Nation's Capital.\\" National Parks.

In the 2003 Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act (part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Act, ), Congress changed the name of the commission to the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. The act also laid new significant restrictions on memorial design and approval. These restrictions include: * A requirement that the core of the cross-axis of the National Mall in the District of Columbia remain free of commemorative works. * Specific recognition of the Monumental Core (the \\"Reserve\\"), Area I, and Area II as defined by the Joint Task Force on Memorials. * A ban on any new commemorative works or visitors' centers within the Reserve. * A ban on any commemorative work commemorating a lesser conflict or a unit of any armed forces. * A requirement that legislative authority for a commemorative work expire after seven years. Exceptions are made for those works which obtain a construction permit from the government before the expiration, and for those works for which a final design has been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts and for which 75 percent of the required construction funds have been raised. * A requirement that no construction permit should issue unless the sponsor of the commemorative work has donated an amount equal to 10 percent of the estimated construction cost as a perpetual maintenance fund. * A ban on any museum within Area I or East Potomac Park. * A ban on donor acknowledgements on commemorative works. =Bypassed procedures= Since 1986, the National Capital Memorial Commission and procedures established by the Commemorative Works Act have been bypassed only twice. The first time was when Congress specifically passed legislation (the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Act) in 2003. This legislation authorized a visitors' center next to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The second was when Congress enacted \\"An Act to Expedite the Construction of the World War II Memorial in the District of Columbia\\" () in 2001.

It is located in the north of the city and is one of the more affluent districts of the city. This district is mostly inhabited by upper class residents. The boundaries are Calle 39 in the south, Avenida Caracas in the west, Calle 100 in the north and the Eastern Hills in the east. The Central Business District (CBD) is located between Calle 72 (traditionally known as the Financial District) in the south and Calle 100 in the north. Chapinero hosts several important leisure, dining and nightlife areas of the city. The locality covers . 35.1% is considered urban area, 23.1% unbuilt area; 20.4% residential area and 21.2% protected rural area.  History  English architecture in El Nogal North of the District of Chapinero in Bogota Chapinero was part of the thoroughfare connecting Bogot√° and the northern part of the country. The area was settled in 1812 by workers in the various industries that provided Bogot√° with its day-to-day necessities. The name Chapinero comes from the shoemakers of bespoke shoes for chapines, the local expression for people suffering of pigeon toe syndrome. Toward the end of the 19th century, the area was further settled with mansions and country estates. As the urbanized city expanded, the area was integrated accordingly. Mule- pulled trams were extended northward in 1875, followed by electric tracks in 1910. When the Special District of Bogot√° was formed in 1955, the area was made into a locality. At that time the El Lago, Chic√≥, and Catalu√±a neighborhoods were added into the locality. The physical boundaries remained the same under the reorganization into the Capital District that took place in 1991. Together with La Candelaria and Teusaquillo, Chapinero is one of the traditional neighborhoods that is distinctive of a particular era in the city's history and urban growth. A historically upper-class neighborhood, the southern part of Chapinero is famous for areas with large Victorian houses reflecting the influence of European architectural styles in Bogot√° at the beginning of the 20th century.  Economy and culture  Our Lady of Lourdes Basilica 93 Park Chapinero is one of the most important commercial and economic zones of the capital city. Banking and financial centers are headquartered along Calle 72, Carrera 7 and Calle 100 with major shopping areas located along Carreras 11 and 15. Several universities are based in the locality, including the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Catholic University of Colombia, Universidad Piloto de Colombia, and the National Pedagogic University. The zone also includes popular dining areas and nightlife centers, which include the Zona Rosa, the Parque de la 93, and the Zona G; the last one known for its wide offer of upscale restaurants (G stands for Gourmet). Chapinero is also the center of Bogot√°'s gay community. There are more than 100 bars, discos and clubs that cater to the gay community in Bogot√°, many of which can be found in Chapinero. The biggest and most popular gay disco in Bogot√°, Theatron, is located in the heart of Chapinero. Furthermore, the former mayor of Chapinero, Blanca In√©s Dur√°n Hern√°ndez, is openly lesbian. The locality has a unique community center focused on the LGBT population of the neighborhood and the city. It is the first of its kind in Latin America.  Government  Chapinero is among the 20 localities that make up the Capital District of Bogota and thus has its own local administration that is under the jurisdiction of the District's Government secretariat. The current locality mayor is Hernando J. Quintero, appointed by the Mayor of Bogot√°, Enrique Pe√±alosa. For the 2015 fiscal year it counted with a budget of 26,053,160,000 pesos, about US$8,400,000.

He became an important leader of eastern Venezuela and for a short while in 1835 seized power over the new state of Venezuela. Family His father was the captain of the \\"Santiago Mari√±o de Acu√±a\\" militias and \\"Lieutenant Greater Justice of the Gulf of Paria\\". His mother, Atanasia Carige Fitzgerald, of Creole and Irish descent, was from Chaguaramas in the island of Trinidad, where his parents resided while he was a boy. He had a sister, Concepci√≥n Mari√±o. Due to his parents' wealth he was well educated. After his father's death in 1808, he moved to the island of Margarita (about 250 km west of Trinidad, off the Venezuelan coast), to take possession of his inheritance. =Masonry= Mari√±o was also one of the greatest figures in the history of Freemasonry in Venezuela, although he was apparently initiated in Trinidad. He was awarded the title of \\"Serenismo Gran Maestro del Gran Oriente Nacional\\" ('The Most Serene Grand Master of the Great National East\\", a title equivalent to the modern Grand Master). Revolutionary Wars =Napoleonic Wars: War of Spanish Independence (1808‚Äì1814)= Signature of Santiago Mari√±o The rise of the revolutionary movement in Venezuela was strongly influenced by the confusing and rapidly changing situation in Spain. Spain was initially against France in the Napoleonic Wars, but in 1795 France declared war on Spain which concluded an alliance with France and declared war on Great Britain. The British responded by blockading Spain, whose colonies were for the first time cut off from their colonial rulers, and began to trade independently with Britain. British support for the Venezuelan revolutionaries from Trinidad Thomas Picton, the first British Governor of Trinidad after the capitulation of the Spanish, who held office from 1797 to 1803, was a great support to the revolutionaries or \\"Patriots\\" in Venezuela. Soon after becoming governor, he issued a proclamation on 6 June 1797, based on suggestions from Britain, which stated: :\\"The object which at present I desire most particularly to bring to your attention, is the means which might best be adopted to liberate the people of the continent near to the Island of Trinidad from the oppressive and tyrannic system which supports with so much vigour the monopoly of commerce.... In order to fulfil this intention with the greater facility, it will be prudent for your Excellency to animate the inhabitants of Trinidad in keeping up the communication which they had with those of Tierra Firma previous to the reduction of that Island, under assurance that they will find there an entrepot or general magazines of every sort of every sort of goods whatsoever. To this end His Britannic Majesty has determined in Council to grant freedom to the ports of Trinidad, with a direct trade to Great Britain....\\"Carmichael. (1961), p. 45. Ironically, the 1807 devastating defeat of the British invasions of the River Plate in South America, largely by local militias, encouraged a more independent attitude in Spain's American colonies. Spanish power weakens, paving the way to Independence After the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805), Spain changed sides again, only to realign itself with France after Napoleon defeated Prussia in 1807. However, Spain was had been severely weakened by all these wars, opening an opportunity for the revolutionaries in South America. Following this, the Spanish king, Ferdinand VII, was deposed by Napoleon in 1808. He had been on the throne just 48 days after his father Charles IV abdicated in his favor. He was replaced by Joseph Bonaparte, the elder brother of Napoleon, who ruled as king of Spain from 6 June 1808Gazeta de Madrid de 14 de junio page 568 to 11 December 1813. A \\"Supreme Central Junta\\" was formed to govern in the name of Ferdinand, marking the beginning of Spain's War of Independence from French domination. Joseph Bonaparte and his brother, Napoleon, led a long and bitter war against the British forces under the Duke of Wellington, culminating in Napoleon being forced to allow the reinstatement of Ferdinand VII on 11 December 1813, who ruled Spain until his death in 1833. =First Republic= On 19 April 1810 the city council or cabildo of Caracas reformed itself as a Junta, soon to be followed by the provincial centres such as Barcelona, Cuman√°, M√©rida, and Trujillo. They saw themselves as allied with the Junta of Seville which ruled in the name of the king. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var saw the setting up of the Junta as a step toward outright independence. Ports were opened to international trade, particularly with Britain which received preferential treatment, paying 25% less tax than other nations. The young Bol√≠var went to London and Mari√±o to Port of Spain (Trinidad) to seek support if Venezuela was attacked and to pressure the Spanish grants special privileged. This was difficult to do as Britain and Spain were allies, but he was given promises of future trade concessions. Spain viewed these developments with alarm and, in 1810, declared the popular party rebels, the province was treated as enemy territory and its ports were blockaded.Carmichael. (1961), p. 102. Sir Thomas Hislop The Royalists held Guyana and the Orinoco Delta, while the rebel Patriots held the coasts from Matur√≠n to Cape la Pe√±a. In late 1812 Mari√±o joined Colonel Manuel Villapol, who marched to Guayana. Excelling in combat, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Some months later he was appointed Commander of G√ºiria, bravely defending that centre of the Royalists' assault, and was promoted to the rank of colonel. The Venezuelan War of Independence occurred while the Spanish were preoccupied with that of New Granada and Spain. On 17 December 1819 the Congress of Angostura established Gran Colombia's independence from Spain. After the Battle of San Mateo, the Republic collapsed, and Francisco de Miranda capitulated to Monteverde, signing an armistice on 25 July 1812. Mari√±o's Venezuelan Patriots who survived either fled or were imprisoned. Mari√±o himself retired to a property owned by his sister, in Trinidad.Carmichael. (1961), p. 103. =Second Republic= Mari√±o's invasion of Venezuela Mari√±o was informed of the ill-treatment that befell Miranda and the other patriotic men, by the Royalist leader General Monteverde, who violated the terms of the armistice by imprisoning many Venezuelans. Indignant at such abuse, Mari√±o assembled an expeditionary force of 45 Patriots on the small island of Chacachacare off the coast of Trinidad. Among this small group which were the future Generals Jos√© Francisco Berm√∫dez, Francisco Azcue and Manuel Piar. With that handful of revolutionaries with a few muskets, they crossed the Gulf of Paria in canoes, and landed on the coast of Venezuela on 11 January 1813. Just prior to Mari√±o's force leaving, the Governor of Trinidad, General Hector William Munro intent on proving Trinidad's neutrality, sent a detachment of the 1st West India Regiment to the tiny island of Chacachacare to investigate claims that a military force was gathering there and to disperse it peacefully, if possible. They returned to report they had discovered nothing, but Munro issued a Proclamation stating that the Government of Trinidad was strictly neutral, and officially banished Mari√±o from Trinidad (after he had left) and seized the property of all those involved with the affair. The tiny invasion force captured Guiria, a small town on the gulf coast of Venezuela. Fortunately for them, the main body of 500 Royalist troops had recently moved inland, leaving only the local militia which was quickly overcome. News of the victory spread quickly and Mari√±o was soon leading a force of 5,000 men armed and equipped with supplies captured at Guiria. They then marched against Matur√≠n on the Rio Guarapiche. Apparently, Bol√≠var was pleased that the Royalists would now have to fight on two fronts but he wanted to liberate Caracas before Mari√±o was able to do so.Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's Quest for Glory, p. 75. Richard W. Slatta and Jane Lucas de Grummond. Texas A&M; University Press. (2003). . Tussles with Bol√≠var and other independence leaders In 1813 Sim√≥n Bol√≠var joined the army of United Provinces of New Granada. After winning a series of battles, Bol√≠var received the approval of the \\"New Granadan Congress\\" to lead a liberating force into Venezuela in what became known as the Admirable Campaign. At the same time, Santiago Mari√±o invaded from the east in an independently organized campaign. Both forces quickly defeated the royalist troops in various battles, such as Alto de los Godos. Bol√≠var entered Caracas on 6 August 1813, proclaiming the restoration of the Venezuelan republic, which was not fully recognized by Mari√±o based in Cuman√°, although the two leaders did cooperate militarily. There was a struggle between the two men for the leadership. Mari√±o named himself \\"Chief of the Independent Army\\" conquered eastern Venezuela and set up a separate political entity in the east. But Bol√≠var insisted that it was essential to have one central government uniting Venezuela and New Granada to ensure its viability ‚Äì his first proposal of a greater Colombia.Sim√≥n Bol√≠var: A Life, pp. 76, 78. John Lynch. (2006). Yale University Press. In February and March 1814, Mari√±o and his forces fought alongside Bol√≠var. They regrouped at Valencia and Bol√≠var handed over command to Mari√±o, \\"as a sure sign of his high opinion of his person and services, and also in this way to ensure the adhesion of the eastern officers to the common cause of Venezuela.\\" However, due to their series of repeated reverses they both had to retreat from central Venezuela to the port of Car√∫pano. Bol√≠var and Mari√±o were arrested and removed from power by Jos√© F√©lix Ribas and Manuel Piar, each representing the two republican commands then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On 8 September, after the fall of the second republic, Bol√≠var and Mari√±o set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans. In 1815 Bolivar and Mari√±o left for Jamaica and Haiti. In 1816 participated in the first expedition of Les Cayes and arriving at Venezuela was named second of the Liberator. Defeated in Ocumare de la Costa Bol√≠var returned from Haiti to Barcelona calling on all to join together, but first Berm√∫dez and Vald√©z rebelled against Mari√±o, and then Mari√±o against Bol√≠var. In 1816 Bol√≠var used the island of Margarita as his base of operations and, in 1817, the Spanish General Pablo Morillo was driven off the island.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Vol. VI, (1977), p. 613. He inspired the Cariaco Congress with Jose Cort√©s de Madariaga, in which federalism was revived in Venezuela, that caused a clash with Bolivar that dissolved the Congress. As a deputy, Mari√±o represented the province of Cuman√° in the second Congress of Venezuela, meeting in Angostura on 15 February 1819, from which he had the license to return to the army. That same year, it triumphed over the colonel Eugenio Arana in the combat of Cantaura and while Bolivar operated in the liberation of Viceroyalty of New Granada took part in the movement that displaced Francisco Antonio Zea of the vice-presidency of the Republic. In his place was named the general in chief Juan Bautista Arismendi, and Mari√±o was nominated commander in chief of the army of the east. Once Bolivar arrived in the city of Angostura, Mari√±o was promoted as the General Staff. Rapprochement with Bol√≠var and other leaders finally leads to Independence Gradually more and more of the caudillos (warlords or political bosses) began to join Bol√≠var, but then Piar rebelled against him and was finally put to death in October 1817. Conflict between Bol√≠var and Mari√±o escalated and in 1818 distracted the military campaign enough to allow the Royalists to dominate Cuman√°. Finally Bol√≠var managed to win Mari√±o over by appointing him General-in-Chief of the Army of the East with control over the plains of Barcelona, while Berm√∫dez and Cede√±o were given the rest of the eastern districts and P√°ez was yet to be pacified.Latin America Between Colony and Nation: Selected Essays (The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy), pp. 172‚Äì173. John Lynch. (2001) Palgrave Macmillan; Reprint edition. . Mari√±o was a member of the Venezuelan Congress in 1819 and was Chief of Staff during the second Battle of Carabobo, which, on 24 June 1821, finally secured Venezuelan independence.Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Empire: 1402‚Äì1975, p. 383. Sam L. Slick, et al. (1991). Greenwood Press. . =Later activities= In May 1831, a council of 150 residents of the city of Barcelona, General Santiago Mari√±o and Jos√© Tadeo Monagas were invested as the principal authorities of the \\"State of the East\\", until the installation of the first Congress to be convened later. After that, President Jos√© Antonio P√°ez stopped this separatist attempt, negotiating with the Monagas brothers, convincing them to submit to central authority. On 8 July 1835, there was a violent and bloody military coup to overthrough president Jose Maria Vargas, known as the \\"Revoluci√≥n de las Reformas\\", headed by Mari√±o, which had the objectives of establishing military control, the religion of the State, to vindicate the name of Sim√≥n Bolivar as Liberator, and to reconstruct Great Colombia. On 9 July 1835 President Vargas and Vice-president Andr√©s Narvarte were expelled to the Island of Saint Thomas, and Mari√±o briefly took the power of the country. However, Jos√© Antonio P√°ez and his forces entered Caracas on 28 July to find it abandoned by the Reformists, and reinstated Vargas, putting an early end to Mari√±o's military rule. Mari√±o was forced into exile in 1836, fleeing to Cura√ßao, Jamaica, Haiti, and finally Colombia. Mari√±o returned to Venezuela in 1848 and became Army Chief under President Jos√© Tadeo Monagas to confront his former leader, General Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, also President of Venezuela.The Politics of Exile in Latin America, p. 282 and n. 17. Mario Sznajder and Luis Roniger. (2009) Cambridge University Press. . Mari√±o unsuccessfully bid for the presidency of Venezuela several times in the 1830s and 40s. In 1848 he led the forces supporting President Monagas which overthrew P√°ez at the 'Batalla de Los Araguatos' on 10 March 1848. P√°ez was imprisoned, and eventually exiled. Mari√±o died in the town of La Victoria on 4 September (or, according to one source, 20 November), 1854.

He was the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from 2001 to 2004 under President George W. Bush. Scully currently is a Principal at Lincoln Policy Group and a partner at its affiliated law firm Scully, Roskey & Missmar, where he focuses on health care regulatory and legislative matters, as well as on advising clients on health policy and strategies for health care delivery. Scully is also a general partner at Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a private equity investment firm, where he focuses on health care investments.  Biography  Scully received his B.A. from the University of Virginia in 1979 and his J.D. from Catholic University in 1986. From 1979 to 1981 he was a reports analyst for the Federal Election Commission. Scully began his political career by working for US Senator Slade Gorton from 1980 to 1985. Scully then served as an attorney with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP from 1985 to 1988. In 1988, Scully joined the presidential campaign of President George H. W. Bush. Following that, he worked at the White House as Deputy Assistant to the President and Counselor to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from 1992 to 1993; and as Associate Director of OMB for Human Resources, Veterans and Labor from 1989 to 1992. Scully, then, reentered private practice with the Washington, D.C. law firm of Patton Boggs, LLP, where he focused on regulatory and legislative work in health care. In his next role, Scully served as President and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals from 1995 to 2001. The Federation represents over 1,500 privately owned and managed hospitals. It was from this position that Scully was nominated and confirmed as the HCFA Administrator ( later CMS). In this role, Scully served as the top executive in the management of Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and other national health care initiatives. Administrator of Medicare Scully speaking at the announcement of the nationwide expansion of the Nursing Home Quality Initiative in 2002 =Medicare Improvement and Modernization Act= On December 8, 2003, President George W. Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which established Medicare Part D (prescription drug benefit) and Part C (Medicare Advantage). Scully played a pivotal role in the development and design of the proposal, and led the Administration's effort to craft the final in bill in Congress. The Administration's position was that the Act would increase the federal deficit by $395 billion between 2004 and 2013. The Bush administration had been informed that Medicare's chief actuary, Richard Foster, had estimated he cost at $534 billion. Scully threatened to fire Foster if he made that information public before the vote. =Collection & publication of data on healthcare providers= In his first speech as CMS Administrator, Scully announced that Medicare would begin collecting and publishing quality data on health care providers across the country including hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies and dialysis centers. The program began with the reporting of quality measures for nursing homes in a handful of states. In those states, 78 percent of the nursing homes reported that they tried to improve, according to CMS. The next step for the program was the publication of performance by nursing homes nationwide on 10 measures ranging from the percentage of residents with pressure sores to those in physical restraints. A $700,000 advertising campaign publicizing the measures began in conjunction with the release of the data. The intention of the program was to provide consumers with a comparison of nursing homes while encouraging the homes to get better, according to a statement by Scully at the time. Critics of the program complained that nursing homes were being asked to do additional work in order to report the measures while they were dealing with funding cutbacks. In July 2003, Scully announced that CMS would begin paying bonuses to hospitals that scored well on 35 quality measures. Hospitals nationwide would vie for $7 million in higher reimbursement by providing superior care for five conditions: heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, coronary artery bypass surgery, and hip and knee replacements. In addition, CMS posted report cards on the hospitals' performance on the public CMS website. The program was hailed as large step towards improving the American health care system by leading to a more rational health care pricing system. Scully also initiated a broad public education campaign to improve seniors‚Äô awareness and utilization of their Medicare benefits. The US$30 million publicly funded advertising campaign called, \\"Helping You Help Yourself\\" was designed to inform Medicare beneficiaries about the Medicare web site and toll-free phone number, which could answer their questions about health care plans. =New Name for HCFA= On July 1, 2001, Scully presided over his agency's name change: the Health Care Financing Administration would now be called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. =Recent Developments= In 2006, Scully led the investment and development in Member Health, the 3d largest Part D pharmacy benefit manager in the post acute management area, which was subsequently purchased by CVS Health. In 2013, Scully founded naviHealth, now a Cardinal Health Company. In 2015, Scully led the investment and development in Innovage, the country's largest and leading Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). He currently sits on the boards of Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, at the University of Virginia and the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&M.; He is the Vice-Chairman of the Alliance for Health Policy. He also Chairs the Boards of InnovAge and Trusted Health.

History  In 1957 Ely High School for Girls moved out of the centre of Ely to an extensive site on Downham Road. St Audrey's Infant School was built nearby on the site around the same time. In 1969 a donation from the Catherine Needham Foundation, a local charitable trust set up in memory of Lady Catherine Needham, enabled the establishment of the Needham's County Secondary School adjacent to the High School. In September 1972 Ely High School, Soham Grammar School and Needham's Secondary Modern Schools merged to become the City of Ely College as part of the change to comprehensive education in Ely. The College was located in the former Needham's building and a VIth Form College was established in the old Girls' High School building. Subsequently, they became the City of Ely Community College. In 2011 the school was renamed Ely College. In September 2010, the College's governors adopted Foundation status, and in 2011, they applied to the Secretary of State to change to Academy status, proposing to join the CfBT Schools Trust, an Academies Trust formed by CfBT, one of the UK's leading educational charities. Ely College joined the Trust in January 2012, but then joined the CMAT group of schools in September 2016 instead. CMAT and the House System CMAT was formed in 2011. The Trust began as Cambridge Meridian Education Trust (CMET) in March 2009 to promote the new schools at Northstowe, a new town proposed between Swavesey and Cambridge. The trust started with Swavesey Village College. In March 2011 CMET became Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust (CMAT), a multi-academy trust, so that Swavesey Village College could convert to an academy and sponsor other academies. Ely College is organised into four 'Houses', each of which consist of around 250 students, 12 tutor groups and 30 staff. Houses are responsible for monitoring and ensuring the welfare and progress of the students; each House has a distinct identity, but applies common structures and systems. They are named Etheldreda (after Saint Etheldreda), Scott (after explorer Scott of the Antarctic), Franklin (after famous scientist Rosalind Franklin) and Turing (after mathematician Alan Turing). This house system is used in many of the CMAT academies. Bishop Laney Bishop Laney (named after Ely's Bishop who lived from 1590-1674), formerly Ely College Sixth Form, is a Sixth Form in Ely, sharing some of the property with Ely College. Also one of the CMAT schools as well as part of the Staploe Education Trust, it is an ongoing partnership between Ely College and Soham Village College. The Sixth Form provides both traditional A-Level courses and Level 2 and 3 Technical Awards. It also works with Norwich City Football Club to provide a football course, which can be taken alongside other courses. The Sixth Form takes part in many activities with the College. Zero tolerance controversy In April 2011 the Daily Express dubbed Ely College \\"Britain's strictest school\\". In a newsletter to parents that month, Headteacher Catherine Jenkinson-Dix had issued a warning about the introduction of a zero-tolerance policy for the school, rigidly enforcing existing policies on school uniforms and discipline, plus restricting the use of mobile phones and iPods. Defending the action, she stated: \\"This is fundamental in preparing them for their future careers, where they certainly would not get away with being rude, dressing inappropriately and chewing gum.\\" The school came under scrutiny in the national press over detentions. The Daily Mirror reported that on one day, one-fifth of the schools pupils were put in detention for \\"a crackdown on school behaviour\\". Some parents were supportive and by the following month Catherine Jenkinson- Dix was claiming the policy to have been a success, saying that it had enabled teachers to spend more time teaching as they are dealing with fewer distractions in the classroom.  Ofsted reports  In 2013, Ofsted rated Ely College as 'Good'.http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/137779 In 2015, Ofsted rated Ely College as 'Inadequate' and requiring special measures.

Biography Ferr√°n was born in Madrid on 7 July 1835 to well-to-do parents of Catalan and Aragonese descent. The family business was in manufacturing gilded moldings. His father went off to Havana to seek his fortune and Augusto began studying at the Instituto del Noviciado. He travelled to Germany, passing through Paris, and there came in contact with the poetry of Heinrich Heine as well as Friedrich Schubert, Felix Mendelsohn and Robert Schumann. His mother died in 1859 and he returned to Madrid. Back at home, he founded a magazine, El S√°bado, with the aim of disseminating German lyric poetry. The magazine did not last long, but his labors allowed him to meet and befriend Julio Nombela, a pamphleteer. Together they founded another short-lived magazine, Las Artes y las Letras. In 1860 he travelled to Paris with Nombela, but his economic difficulties and prodigal tendencies landed him in the hands of usurers. He was forced to return to Madrid, and there Nombela introduced him to an acquaintance: Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer. In late 1861 El Museo Universal published his Traducciones e imitaciones del poeta alem√°n Enrique Heine (Translations and Imitations of the German Poet Heinrich Heine), and several of his other works appeared in Almanaque in 1863. He obtained an editorial post at El Semanario Popular, and this finally positioned him to spread Heine's work to Spain. By 1861 his book La soledad had appeared in print. The first part of the book reproduced several popular songs of traditional lyricism, and the second part featured original work that imitate their style and inspiration. Recurring themes are a search for solitude in which to flee from a hostile world, the struggle between rich and poor, the passage of time, existentialism, and love. The book received enthusiastic support from Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer, and his words were added as a prologue in subsequent editions. He helped create a popular genre of song-based poetry that owed much to Heine; around the same time as Antonio de Trueba's Libro de los cantares (1852), fellow Heine translator Eulogio Florentino Sanz and friend Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer were producing very similar work. Other examples of authors moved by the same Volkgeist include Terencio Thos y Codina (Semanario Popular, 1862-1863), Rosal√≠a de Castro (Cantares gallegos, 1863), Ventura Ruiz Aguilera (Armon√≠as y cantares, 1865), Aristides Pongilioni (R√°fagas po√©ticas, 1865), Melchor de Palau (Cantares, 1866), and Jos√© Puig y P√©rez (Coplas y quejas, 1869). This genre would ultimately lead to the Neopopularist school of the Generation of 27. Ferr√°n spent part of 1863 in the Veruela monastery, after having visited there on several previous occasions. At some point he also resided in Alcoy, where he directed the Diario de Alcoy (1865-1866), but he eventually returned to the capital city. He may have returned to collaborate on La Ilustraci√≥n de Madrid that B√©cquer would direct in 1868 during the revolution. When B√©cquer died, Ferr√°n worked on the posthumous edition of his Obras (1871) alongside Rodr√≠guez Correa and Narciso Campillo. In that same year he produced his second book of verse, La pereza, that revisited his previous work and included various newspaper-style articles. The book's content had a popular meter much like the first, but it possessed much more variety in that it featured sole√°s, seguidillas, and seguidillas gitanas in addition to the previous forms. The themes of the book were basically similar, but folklore ran much more strongly in the second. Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez often recited his favorite poem from this book, reproduced below: ::::::::::Eso que est√°s esperando ::::::::::d√≠a y noche, y nunca viene; ::::::::::eso que siempre te falta ::::::::::mientras vives, es la muerte. In 1872 or 1873 he emigrated to Chile where he supposedly married (according to Nombela). Soon after his return in 1878, he was admitted to the Manicomio de Carabanchel in Madrid where he died on 2 April 1880. Legacy Ferr√°n's poetry assumes a break with the traditional tone that is reminiscent of Quintana. His verse is closely related to spoken language, and his sparse words are directed toward a variety of intimate and openly sentimental content that is bettered by being brief and confident. The same tradition was followed by many other important poets like B√©cquer, Antonio Machado, and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez. In prose, Ferr√°n published German translations and several legends. His translations of Heine appeared in El Museo Universal (1861), in El Eco del Pa√≠s (1865), and in La Ilustraci√≥n Espa√±ola y Americana (1873). His translations often employed the same combinations of seven-syllable and eleven-syllable verses common to B√©cquer's work. He also translated heine's famous preface to Don Quijote.

Its proportions are 1:2 with three pales of equal width coloured green (hoist side), white (centre), and pink (on the fly). The design originated in the late 19th century with the Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association, an aid and benefit organization established in St. John's in 1871 by the Catholic Church. The flag was unofficial but the official banner of the association was a green background with a white star and a pink cross in the centre. The Star of the Sea is Polaris, the North Star, which was very important in navigation. Mary, mother of Jesus, is also known as Our Lady, Star of the Sea in the Catholic Church. While the colours were taken from the official banner, the flag's design may have been influenced by the then unofficial Irish tricolour and or a local design (red at the hoist, white in the centre and green on the fly tricolour) which was used by the Newfoundland Natives' Society (NNS) from the mid 1800s. The NNS flag had fallen out of use since the demise of the society.Carolyn Lambert, Emblem of our Country, Newfoundland and Labrador Studies, Volume 23, Number 1, 2008.John FitzGerald, \\"Pink, white and green\\", The Independent, January 9, 2005.Paul O'Neill, The Oldest City: The Story of St. John's, Newfoundland, 2003, . With the introduction of the unofficial Labrador flag in March 1974 and the official change of the province's name to \\"Newfoundland and Labrador\\" in December 2001 the green-white-pink tricolour is generally considered to be the unofficial flag of the Newfoundland region of the province. Origins Official flag of Ireland Incorrect flag of Ireland Historical evidence indicates that the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" flag first appeared in the late 1880s to early 1890s as the flag of the Roman Catholic fraternal group the Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association, which was formed in St. John's in 1871.Newfoundland Historical Society, A Short History of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. John's, NL, Boulder Publications, 2008. It bears a strong resemblance to the nearly identical Flag of Ireland but with the Protestant representation of the orange panel of King William of Orange removed and replaced by a pink panel; pink being a liturgical colour of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran and many other Christian denominations symbolizing a joyous celebration and was an official colour of the Star of the Sea Association. Similar alternate versions of the Irish Flag with the orange panel replaced also exist, though these are not recognised by the Irish government.Department of the Taoiseach, An Bhratach N√°isi√∫nta: The National Flag, Dublin, Ireland. =Popular mythical origins= A popular legend presented in the July 1976 issue of the Roman Catholic archdiocese's newsletter \\"The Monitor\\" is commonly (though erroneously) believed to present the origins of the flag.Paul O'Neill, \\"Around and About\\", The Monitor, July 1976, pp. 11‚Äì12. The legend tells that the flag was created in 1843 by Bishop Michael Anthony Fleming and is symbolic of a tradition between local Protestants and Catholics. The annual wood hauls of firewood by sealers, waiting for their vessels to leave the port of St. John's, would get embroiled in a competition to supply wood to the Anglican cathedral, Roman Catholic cathedral, schools and other charity institutions. The Protestant English marked their wood piles with the rose flag of the Newfoundland Natives' Society, while the Catholic Irish used green banners. The threat of violence was such that the Speaker of the House, William Carson, suggested that Bishop Fleming should be enlisted as a peacemaker. Rather than simply preaching sermons, it was decided that Fleming would try to unite the sides. To that end, Bishop Fleming persuaded the two factions to adopt a common flag, tying together the rose and green flags of the two groups with a white handkerchief, which was to symbolize peace.A brief regarding the proposal of the Government of Newfoundland & Labrador for a Distinctive Provincial Flag (St. John's: Newfoundland Historical Society, 1977), p17.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, . The pink/rose-colour is said to have symbolized the Protestant English since a rose (the Tudor rose) is the national floral emblem of England. This has been questioned as the Tudor Rose is actually red and white, not pink, while the green of the shamrock symbolized the mostly Catholic Irish. The white was taken from the Cross of St. Andrew, the patron saint of fishermen and Scotland. Saint Patrick's Cross, a red saltire on a field of white This is not the original version of the legend, however, but rather appears to be a modification of an older legend intended to incorporate Protestant English representation into a flag originating within the Roman Catholic Irish community. In 1900 historians Devine and O'Mara told that the concept of the flag was originated by Bishop Fleming in the mid-19th century as a symbolic gesture to quiet tensions between newly arriving Irish settlers and the existing Roman Catholic community in the St. John's area. The local Newfoundland 'Bush-borns' and 'Old Country' Irish-borns were embroiled in rivalry to supply the biggest load of wood to the Roman Catholic Cathedral during the big yearly wood haul. There was argument over which group had the larger load and violence between them ensued. Upon hearing of this, Fleming induced them to join their pink and green wood slide markers together with neutral white being placed in between and thus was born the concept which eventually became the pink, white and green flag of the Star of the Sea fraternal association for Catholics. In this version of the story, pink similarly represented Newfoundland-born Catholics, possibly members of a \\"natives\\" group, that were supplying wood to Fleming himself, with the Protestant English not included in the proceedings at all. Devine and O'Mara conceded that this story was based on oral tradition with no actual historical evidence to support it. In 1902, however, the colour pink (rose) was designated to represent the \\"rose of England\\" by the first Newfoundland-born Roman Catholic bishop and future Archbishop of St. John's Michael Francis Howley in the poem The Flag of Newfoundland, which he is credited as having written at that time and proposing it as an alternative national anthem to Sir Charles Cavendish Boyle's Ode to Newfoundland - Boyle being Newfoundland's British colonial governor from 1901 to 1904. Howley attempted to overcome the perception of the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" as a Catholic flag by incorporating Protestant representation and turning the flag into a symbol representing all Newfoundlanders. This was a somewhat awkward assertion since the \\"rose of England\\"is not pink/rose. However, the national floral emblem of England is a rose, the red and white Tudor rose instituted by King Henry VII as the symbol of unified England following what became known as the War of the Roses. Historically, the colour pink/rose has never been used to represent England, its people or any of the Protestant churches of England or Newfoundland. However, the colour pink seen as rose could be said to evoke the image of a rose which is England's floral emblem. Pink/rose is a liturgical colour of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran and many other Christian denominations for a joyous celebration. Pink/rose was in use by other Catholic organizations in St. John's at the time. Furthermore, the Star of the Sea Association's original banner, predating the green-white-pink tricolour, consisted of a white star and a pink cross on a green background, as specified in their original rules and by-laws. Incidentally, by specifying the colour green in the poem as representing \\"St. Patrick's emblem\\",the shamrock, Howley joined many Irish nationalists in rejecting the red saltire of Saint Patrick's Cross, which they see as a British invention and which forms the diagonal red cross of the Union Jack meant to represent Ireland.Hayes-McCoy, p.38. Nevertheless, Howley was somewhat successful as many but not most Newfoundlanders accepted it as a national symbol of Newfoundland. =Actual historical origins= There is no historical evidence to support Bishop Fleming ever creating the pink, white and green flag. The first published record of the now popularly accepted legend was in a Catholic church archdiocese newsletter during the provincial flag debates of the 1970s, and was not presented as fact at that time. The Newfoundland Natives' Society flag is believed by some historians to have consisted of a green spruce tree on a pink background with two clasped hands and the word \\"philanthropy\\" eventually added, though there is no hard evidence to support that this flag ever really existed, that it was ever abandoned, or that the pink, white and green tricolour was ever adopted by the society The NNS was not a Catholic or Protestant society but a nationalist group formed specifically to promote the advancement of careers and interests of native-born Newfoundlanders, no matter what their ethnic origin or religious affiliation. Its first president, elected by members of the society in 1840, was a Roman Catholic physician by the name of Dr. Edward Kielly. From its early days, it served as a vehicle to allow Newfoundland-born Roman Catholics who opposed Bishop Fleming's political influence to work alongside Protestant reformers (then affiliated with the \\"Tory\\" party) and was openly opposed by Fleming. Available history indicates that the society actually used a tricolour flag of red, white and green, raising the speculation that it was this flag that symbolized peace between the Irish Catholics and English Protestants within the society since red and white was a more fitting representation of the red and white Tudor Rose of England, and the society itself being expressly non-denominational. The red, white and green tricolour of the Newfoundland Natives' Society (NNS) was widely recognized as the flag of Newfoundland during the mid to late nineteenth century. With the introduction of Responsible Government in 1855 the need for the NNS waned and it ceased operations in 1866. The red-white- green flag gradually disappeared from use. The pink, white and green colours of the Catholic Church established Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association, as specified in their first published rules and by-laws, appeared sometime after the group's formation in 1871 and may have been confused with the NNS's red, white and green tricolour by reporters and from black-and-white photographs of the period, from which it is impossible to distinguish the actual colours. There is no reason to believe that the pink and green colours of the Star of the Sea Association flag were intended as a symbol of union between Catholic groups as in the Devine and O'Mara legend. With the Association's inception in 1871, their by-laws stated \\"the banner of the Association shall be green ground, white star with pink cross in the centre\\" and the officers \\"shall wear, at all processions, sashes of green, white and pink.\\" The actual tricolour flag based on these colours, commonly called as the \\"Pink, White and Green\\", seems to have surfaced within the Association sometime in the late 1880s and there is no known historical evidence to indicate its existence before that time. The Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association appeared publicly under these colours, in the form of green, white and pink sashes and green banner with a pink cross and white star for the first time in 1875 when they marched alongside the Benevolent Irish Society in St. John's during their centenary celebrations parade of Irish nationalist Daniel O'Connell's birth. Newspaper descriptions of this event report the NNS's red, white and green flag being flown prominently as the flag of Newfoundland, alongside the flags of England, Ireland, France and the United States, but make no mention of a pink, white and green tricolour. Sometime afterward, the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" tricolour appeared and, with the support of the clergy, was adopted by other Catholic groups in the St. John's and surrounding area in the 1880s and 1890s. Official flag of Newfoundland and Labrador, 1980 to present. It has been suggested on some websites and commercial tourist items that the Irish flag was based on the \\"Pink, White and Green,\\" the basis for this claim being that Irish nationalist Thomas Francis Meagher was the son of Newfoundland-born mayor of Waterford, Ireland, Thomas Meagher Jr., and had designed the Irish flag based on the \\"Pink, White and Green\\". Irish history, however, states that the design that would become the Irish flag goes back as far as 1830 and had widespread recognition by 1848. From March of that year, Irish tricolours appeared side by side with French tricolours at meetings held all over France to celebrate the revolution that had just taken place. In April 1848, Meagher brought a tricolour of green, white and orange to Ireland from Paris, where it is said he received it as a gesture of goodwill from a group of French women. It was presented in a Dublin council meeting and was likely patterned after the French Tricolour flag as a symbolic show of solidarity between the two countries. The green, white and orange Irish tricolour was used unofficially by nationalists as a symbol of opposition to the British government until being adopted publicly by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Easter Uprising of 1916. Despite the popular myth, the earliest historical evidence supporting the appearance of the \\"Pink, White, and Green\\" in Newfoundland points to at least 41 years after the first appearance of the then unofficial Irish tricolour flag and possibly as late as 60 years thereafter. Given this, its origin within an Roman Catholic fraternal group and the first public appearance of the colours in a centenary celebration of Daniel O'Connell's birth, the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" flag may have been based on the then unofficial Irish tricolour flag with the orange panel representing Protestant King William of Orange removed and replaced by pink being a liturgical colour of the Roman Catholic , Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist and many other denominations for a joyous celebration and also an official colour on the banner of the Star of the Sea Association. The subsequent use of the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" by Catholic Irish groups in the St. John's area as a symbol of Newfoundland nationalism and opposition to confederation with Canada in the late 1800s further linked the flag to its Irish counterpart by analogy to Irish nationalists flying of the strikingly similar Irish tricolour in their resistance to union with Britain. Given the inaccuracy of The Monitor's 1976 legend and the heated debates in Newfoundland during the 1970s regarding the design of the new provincial flag, the current legend of the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" was likely propagated at that time in an attempt to gain Protestant (60% of the province's population) and province-wide support for an Irish- based flag, rather than the various Union Jack based designs being proposed at the time, but it is not supported as a factual account of history. From 1931 until confederation with Canada in 1949 the Union Jack was legislated as the national flag of Newfoundland, and then from 1952 until 1980 the Union Jack was readopted as the official flag of the province of Newfoundland. Ottawa's refusal to recognize the Union Jack as a unique representation of the province led to the provincial government seeking a new Newfoundland flag and the eventual adoption of Christopher Pratt's design as the Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador on May 28, 1980. The new flag's design was taken from markings on pendants worn hung from a cord around the neck by the indigenous Beothuck and Innu people. With the colours blue, white and red applied it has an intentional resemblance to the Union Jack it replaced. Use and popular myth The Union Flag, Newfoundland's official provincial flag from 1952 to 1980. Around the turn of the 20th century the \\"Pink White and Green\\" flag gained significant social and possibly commercial use, primarily by Roman Catholic groups in the St. John's and surrounding area. It remained controversial, however, as many Protestants did not accept it as their own flag, feeling that it was, in fact, a Roman Catholic/Irish nationalist flag. Bishop Michael Fleming, credited in popular legend as its creator was, in fact, a self-fashioned leader of the Irish community in Newfoundland and pursued an \\"Irish nationalistic\\" agenda in taking on the local British establishment, even to the point of intervening to get particular men elected. In 1904, the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" was a central symbol for those opposed to confederation with Canada, a sentiment supported by Roman Catholic Archbishop Michael F. Howley and his clergy, particularly on the east coast, thus further associating the flag with the Catholic Church and Irish nationalism in the eyes of many Protestants.Alistair B. Fraser, Flags of Canada, 1998. civil flag from 1904 to 1965 Contrary to popular myth, photos from Government House during Murray's and Boyle's administrations and during the Prince of Wales visit to Newfoundland in 1860 show the Union Jack, the governmental ensigns, and various other flags being flown on ships in St. John's harbour, but not the \\"Pink, White and Green\\". Captain Robert Bartlett, who captained Admiral Peary on his ultimate polar expedition in 1909, was claimed by members of his crew to have planted the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" within six miles of the North Pole.\\"Crew of the Invermore say Capt. Bob Bartlett was within six miles (10 km) of North pole and planted the pink, white and green there\\". The Daily News, St. John's, 16 September 1909. This was in fact untrue, as Bartlett was never closer than 150 miles (241 km) from the pole, with Peary continuing on sled without Bartlett or his crew from there.Harold Horwood, Bartlett: The Great Canadian Explorer, 1977, . The tricolour is said to have been flown alongside the Union Jack at Government House during the administrations of Boyle and Murray, though there is no photographic evidence from the period to support this, with existing photos showing only the Union Jack and governmental Ensigns. An official mail steamer was to be seen flying the tricolour as late as 1907 but was forced by authorities to replace it with the Newfoundland Red Ensign, the civil flag of Newfoundland vessels, upon entering St. John's harbour. After the First World War its use diminished and Newfoundlanders generally flew the Union Jack as their flag - the Union Jack being legislated as the Dominion of Newfoundland's official flag in 1931, with the Newfoundland Red Ensign designated as \\"National Colours\\". In recent years, the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" flag has undergone a revival, and has become popular on T-shirts incorrectly referring to it as \\"the Republic of Newfoundland flag,\\" despite the fact that the flag was never officially recognized as a national or provincial flag, and although Newfoundland was a British Dominion from September 26,1907 it was never a republic. See: Dominion of Newfoundland. It has been claimed that the colours of the flag were incorporated into the first public performance of Sir Cavendish Boyle's \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\" at the Casino Theatre in 1901, where a character resembling the Statue of Liberty clad in a flowing gown of vertical stripes of pink, white and green is said to have appeared on stage. The next day the colours appeared on the cover of the music sheet published by Boyle. The pink, white and green tricolour did, in fact, appear on the first published sheet music of Boyle's \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\", which was published in January 1902, however, the music which was eventually used for the Ode came later and is used to this day. Connecting the pink, white and green with the Ode to Newfoundland was clever but not definitive. The cover to that sheet music depicted the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" being held by a fisherman and intertwined with the Union Jack being held by a Royal Navy sailor. It is unsubstantiated, however, that the PWG tricolour appeared in connection with the first performance of the \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\" at the Casino Theatre. The first performance of the Ode to Newfoundland actually took place on December 22, 1902 as part of the closing of the play MamzelleVolume four, p. 168, Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, .  a play in which the French character Marianne, bearing a strong resemblance to the Statue of Liberty, appears clothed in a tricolour gown of red, white and blue based on the French tricolour. The green-white-pink tricolour exists in Canadian heraldry. Its trice is present in the flag of the St. John's Fire Department. It also appears on the crest on some escutcheons or armorial bearings portrayed in the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada. The tricolour had a resurgence in the province, particularly in the city of St. John's, and there was a popular movement to petition the province to give the flag official status. Premier Danny Williams announced in late 2005 that he would consider opening debate on the matter, and that he personally preferred the tricolour,John Gushue, \\"Williams OK with changing province's flag: 'Personally' endorses Pink, White and Green\\" , The Telegram. but an informal poll commissioned in October 2005 by Williams showed that only 25% of Newfoundlanders supported adopting the tricolour - with cost and the feeling that the colour pink would not be appropriate for the provincial flag being cited as the most popular reasons for rejection. The majority of support for the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" came from St. John's and surrounding Irish Shore area.Mark Quinn, \\"Push for old Newfoundland flag fails to cause ripple, poll finds\\", The Globe and Mail, 29 October 2005, A16. \\"Les Terre-Neuviens souhaitent conserver leur drapeau\\", Radio-Canada, 29 October 2005. Poem The following poem, entitled The Flag of Newfoundland written by Roman Catholic Archbishop Michael F. Howley in 1902 to support acceptance of the tricolour as an official flag for Newfoundland. The poem was proposed as an alternative national anthem to Sir Charles Cavendish Boyle's Ode to Newfoundland. It is the first known reference to the \\"Pink, White and Green\\" flag as being the flag of Newfoundland and marks the first designation of the pink panel as representing the \\"rose of England\\".<ref name=\\"encyclopedia\\" / In another attempt to gain acceptance of the PWG as a flag for Newfoundland, sheet music composed by E.R. Krippner for the Ode to Newfoundland was published with the Union Jack and the PWG tricolour on the cover. However, music composed later by Sir Hubert Parry was chosen by Boyle and is the music used with the Ode to Newfoundland to this day. 1.The pink, the rose of England shows, The green St. Patrick's emblem, bright While in between, the spotless sheen Of St. Andrew's cross displays the white. 2.Then hail the pink, the white, the green, Our patriot flag, long may it stand. Our sirelands twine, their emblems trine To form the flag of Newfoundland. 3.What'er betide our Ocean Bride That nestles 'midst Atlantic's foam, Still far and wide we'll raise with pride A native flag, o'er hearth and home. 4.Should e'er the hand of fate demand Some future change in our career; We ne'er will yield: on flood or field The flag we honour and revere! 5.Fling out the flag o'er creek and cragg; Pink, white and green, so fair, so grand. Long may it sway, o'er bight and bay, Around the shores of Newfoundland. The poem has since been rearranged as a song and recorded or performed by Newfoundland artists. One such case is that of Newfoundland Irish folk band Shanneyganock's \\"Flag of Newfoundland\\" released in 2006.

It serves the area of Alamance County and was established in 1958 as part of a statewide system known as industrial education centers.  History  In 1957 the North Carolina General Assembly distributed funds to create a statewide system of vocational schools for industrial training. In 1959 they officially designated industrial education centers. Burlington-Alamance County Industrial Education Center was established in 1958 as the first of school, and one of the first community colleges in the state. It opened with 1,700 students and offering 15 programs. In 1963 the industrial education centers came under the Department of Community Colleges within the North Carolina State Board of Education, and in 1964 the college was granted the right to award the Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree (A.A.S.) and changed its name to Technical Institute of Alamance. In 1971 Governor Robert W. Scott donated of land to the college, which was used to build a new campus, completed in 1976. In 1977 the college purchased the former Glenhope School in Burlington, renovated it, and renamed it the Burlington Campus of the Technical Institute of Technology. It served mostly as a location of continuing education courses and in 2001 was replaced by a new Burlington Center. In 1985 a new shop building was opened on the Haw River campus. In June 1996, the college constructed a science and technology building on the main campus in Graham. In 1979, the board of trustees changed the name of the college to Technical College of Alamance, and in 1988 to the current name, Alamance Community College. In 2006, Alamance Community College officially became the home of an extensive historical collection of papers and records belonging to the family of Governor Robert W. Scott. In July 2012, the college graduated a record number of students, 821.  Accreditation  Alamance Community College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

Biography =Early life= Howard Storm was born in Newton, Massachusetts. He graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a master's degree, and he later became an art professor at Northern Kentucky University, a position he held for 20 years. During an interview with Unsolved Mysteries in 1997, he reported of his life prior to his near-death experience that he was an atheist and an aggressive person, feared by his wife and children. =Near-death experience= In June 1985, Storm took a group of his students on a field trip to Europe. After returning to his Paris hotel room with his wife around 11:00 a.m. from a morning excursion, he had a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. He was evaluated at a Paris hospital and diagnosed with a duodenal perforation, which required surgery. The earliest a surgeon could perform this procedure was around 9:00 p.m. that day. As he lay waiting for surgery, he truly believed that he was going to die due to the severity of his pain and so mentally prepared himself for death. After saying goodbye to his wife, he eventually passed out. Storm reports the following subconscious experience: He opened his eyes and found himself standing outside of his body, looking down at the hospital bed with his wife crying beside him. He was without pain and hypersensitive. His wife could not see or hear him. He was then drawn by voices calling his name outside the hospital room, and he followed them, believing they were taking him to a doctor. He describes pale humanoid creatures that urged him down the hallway, saying that they had been waiting for him. The creatures became increasingly hostile, and upon refusing to continue following, they began to attack him. He then heard a voice saying, \\"pray to God,\\" and so he recited fragment Bible verses and the Pledge of Allegiance. With mention of the word \\"God,\\" the creatures would retract, and eventually he was alone again. After a period of time, he called out for Jesus to save him, and suddenly was rescued by \\"spiritual beings of light.\\" Thereafter, he had a recollection of his entire life, a life review, which highlighted some negative aspects of his life, before the \\"beings of light\\" answered his questions. They told him that the United States was a \\"blessed nation\\" but one which required a change lest lose its prosperity. He describes visions of a future plagued by war, natural disasters and despair, but which could be avoided should there be a major spiritual \\"shift\\" in the consciousness of the world. These beings told him that the \\"correct religion\\" is that religion which \\"brings you closest to God.\\" When he awoke, he was being prepped for surgery, which repaired the duodenal perforation. In the following days, he reports that he was visited by a doctor upon whose arrival the room lightened, and upon his exit, it darkened again. The nurse (who's desk was just outside Storm's room) had seen nothing. Storm also recounts \\"a Voice\\" that told him to ignore the advice of doctors and buy return tickets to the U.S. a week after his procedure, which he did. Upon his arrival in Cincinnati, he was admitted in the hospital in critical condition with double pneumonia, collapsed lung, extreme peritonitis, and non-A non-B hepatitis. His recovery took five weeks, and he reported a period of 7 months of extreme weakness before he was able to return to work. =Aftermath= Storm stated that over time the experience never faded as memories and dreams do. He became involved with a church, entered the seminary, and was ordained. He served as pastor of Zion United Church of Christ in Norwood, Ohio from 1992 to 2005,History of Zion Church. Accessed 2015-03-22. and he was also a former pastor of the Covington United Church of Christ in Covington, Ohio.

It was originally created and designed by CG as a private venture project.Foss, page 392. As of 2020, the vehicle and its derivatives are no longer being marketed by Textron.  History  The first country to buy it was Panama, which purchased 12 to 13 LAV-300shttps://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.panamacountrystu00medi/?q=caribbean&sp;=277&st;=text in APC, Fire Support Vehicle and Armored Recovery variants.Rottman, Page 14. Most of them were captured by American forces during Operation Just Cause. In Panama Defense Forces services, they were used by the 5th Infantry Company, the 6th Infantry Company (Mechanized) and Battalion 2000 (Mechanized). 4 LAV-300s were used by the 6th Infantry Company while 9 were used by Battalion 2000. They were deployed during the Battle of Paitilla Airport to block the path of the SEALS deployed to destroy Noriega's private aircraft. Kuwait placed an order in 1984 for 62 vehicles, some of them in FSV configuration. Most of Kuwait's LAV-300s were destroyed by Iraqi troops during the 1990 Invasion of Kuwait. When production of the vehicle was reorganized and placed at New Orleans, its name changed from the V-300 to the LAV-300 in 1994. The Philippines placed an order in 1993 for 24 LAV-300 MK IIs, 12 in APC configuration and 12 in FSV configuration, which were delivered by 1995. The contract was worth $USD18.243 million. LAV-300s used by the Philippine Marine Corps were designed to be equipped with the .50 BMG/7.62mm NATO turret for the APC and the 90mm Cockerill 90mm gun for the FSV. In a 1994 report by Natick from January to September 1993, the LAV-300 was once considered to be a suitable candidate for the US Army Military Police Armored Security Vehicle program. In 1999, the LAV-300 was considered alongside the LAV-600 to be selected for the US Army's Brigade Combat Team. In the same year, an infantry fighting vehicle version of the LAV-300 MK II was tested at Fort Knox for potential deployment with rapid reaction forces before the Stryker was chosen instead. This proposal was even backed by Captain David L. Nobles in his proposal due to low economical expenses needed to maintain the LAV-300.https://web.archive.org/web/20170201160230/https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/eARMOR/content/issues/1990/MAY_JUN/ArmorMayJune1990web.pdf Production of the LAV-300 ended in 1994 with marketing discontinued by 2000. In 2008, Cobb County Police Department has reported the purchase of a LAV-300 for $500,000 with $45,000 to $51,000 paid to refurbish the vehicle for police use. The vehicle was acquired by the CCPD through the 1033 program from Fort Polk, Louisiana. In 2010, Federal Defense Industries announced that they entered into an agreement with Textron Marine & Land Systems in order to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the LAV-300 since FDI maintains a technical library for spare parts.https://web.archive.org/web/20190615075157/https://www.fdi.us.com/cadillac- gage In 2011, Napco entered into an agreement with Textron to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the LAV-300.http://www.napcointl.com/Napco%20General%20Presentation.pdf On October 5, 2018, the Philippine Department of National Defense launched a bid to upgrade armored vehicles of the Philippine Navy and Air Force under the Light Armor System Upgrade (LARSU) Acquisition Project with a budget of PHP711,938,000.00. On November 28, 2018, the DND released a bid requirement for a company to modernize the LAV-300s still in working condition with the PMC.NR DND-PN-PAF-LARSU-18-R-03.pdf On January 10, 2019, Larsen & Toubro was awarded a contract for $US 14 million for the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Light Armor System Upgrade in replacing worn out engines and other parts.

He made his first on screen appearance on 20 June 2005. The character departed on 23 July 2006, while Charles was suspended from work. He returned on 12 February 2007. Charles took a temporary break from the show in autumn 2011 to film new episodes of Red Dwarf, with Lloyd departing on 15 December 2011. After a seven-month absence, Lloyd returned on 2 July 2012. Charles announced his departure from the show in May 2015. Charles' final scenes aired on 23 September 2015 in a live episode to celebrate 60 years of ITV. Lloyd departed for good after 10 years alongside his pregnant fianc√©e, Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon) when they left the street together to move to Jersey. He returned with Andrea on 25 September 2015 as they wanted to say goodbye to Steve who missed the leaving party. Lloyd's storylines have included: his comedy-duo act with best friend Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and running taxi firm StreetCars with him; relationships with Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), Cheryl Gray (Holly Quin- Ankrah) and Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard); discovering Cheryl's affair with her ex-husband Chris (Will Thorp); and an engagement with Andrea, which struggled when he discovered she was secretly married, and ended temporarily when Andrea stole a rare 7\\" record (worth ¬£1,000) in order to help her daughter. Storylines Lloyd gets a month's trial as a taxi driver at StreetCars and later buys Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) share of the business and moves into the flat upstairs. He then forms an attraction to Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu) and they begin dating. Lloyd rescues Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and new employee Ronnie Clayton fend off Ronnie's ex-husband, Jimmy when he comes after them with a shotgun. When Kelly suspects Lloyd of cheating on her, she spikes his beer with laxatives, which have him hospitalised. Lloyd later explains that he owes his ex-girlfriend Tina ¬£10,000 she loaned him in order to buy into StreetCars. They move into together but Kelly's friend, Becky Granger proves to be a problem when they let her stay. Becky's behaviour threatens to drive Lloyd and Kelly apart by playing games and even going as far to frame Kelly, but in the end Lloyd evicts Becky. In spite of this, Kelly refuses to accept Lloyd's apology. After Steve confesses to sleeping with Kelly on the night Ronnie ran over a pedestrian, Lloyd is angry with the pair of them and this rift almost dissolves Steeetcars. However, after some time off, Lloyd returns and forgives Steve, but not Kelly. They resume their friendship and move on from the past. Following his relationship with Kelly, Lloyd takes an interest in Jodie Morton (Samantha Seager). However, Jodie is under constant pressure to help run the family business and look after her younger siblings Kayleigh (Jessica Barden) and Finlay. She later moves to London, ending any possibility of a relationship. When Jodie's father, Jerry (Michael Starke) has a heart attack, Lloyd helps him and his family while he is in hospital. When Jerry's ex-wife Teresa Bryant (Karen Henthorn) arrives on the street on hearing about Jerry's plight, it is revealed that she and Lloyd had once had a fling. Teresa takes advantage of this‚Äîas well as Finlay's fondness of Lloyd‚Äîto con Lloyd into believing he is Finlay's biological father. Lloyd believes her and trying to do the decent thing, offers money to help look after him that she pocketed herself. Teresa's con is eventually revealed when WPC Mel (Emma Edmondson), Finlay's older half- sister gets suspicious and it is revealed that Finlay is not Lloyd's son. After Steve has a one-night stand with Becky, Steve's girlfriend Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) becomes suspicious when Steve and Lloyd's behaviour seems strange. Steve flees abroad to see his brother Andy (Nicholas Cochrane), so Michelle bullies Lloyd to tell her what is going on. He lies several times and Michelle discovers that he has been sleeping with someone else. Steve stays away from Michelle but Lloyd convinces Michelle that Steve is planning to propose. Michelle tells her brother Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier) and his wife Maria Connor (Samia Smith), but Lloyd tells her to keep quiet when Steve returns from Spain. Lloyd then tells Michelle the truth, not knowing that Steve has proposed. Lloyd often helps bookmaker Harry Mason (Jack Ellis) and his wife Clarissa (Alexandra Boyd) when they live on the street. Lloyd begins attending Brazilian crunch classes with Steve's mother Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) in an attempt to lose weight, after he enters a bet with Steve, instigated by Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Lloyd is initially reluctant but gives it a try and becomes popular with the ladies due to his looks, personality and DJ-ing skills. When Lloyd returns with Liz later that evening and insists on going home due to the pain, Liz's face shows she has feelings for him and is distressed to see him share a kiss under the mistletoe with Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque), a new member of staff at The Rovers. Lloyd and Liz kiss in private during a dance evening at the Brazilian crunch classes. Upon returning to The Rovers, Lloyd brushes off Danielle and goes to the back yard to meet Liz. The two declare their feelings for one another, share another kiss and secretly sleep together, while Steve is working behind the bar. Lloyd's friendship with Steve suffers when Steve finds out about Lloyd and Liz. Liz and Lloyd break up when he cheats on her with Teresa. Following his breakup with Liz, Lloyd expresses an interest in Cheryl Gray (Holly Quin- Ankrah), a friend of Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson). Lloyd pursues Cheryl, although she resists his advances. Lloyd later discovers that Cheryl works in a strip club. He later also discovers that she is married, and has a son called Russ Gray (Finton Flynn). Lloyd attacks the strip club owner after he sees Cheryl with a black eye, causing Cheryl to lose her job. She then drops the bombshell that it is her husband Chris Gray (Will Thorp), and so Lloyd offers to let her live with him. In December 2010, Lloyd is celebrating Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) stag night in The Joinery, when a fight erupts between him and Chris after he provokes him several times during the evening. The fight intensifies before a huge explosion ends the fight and tears through The Joinery. Lloyd, however, escapes relatively unhurt and even rescues his enemy, Chris. Lloyd kicks down the front door of number 13 only to be blasted back by huge flames. He still manages to save Josh and Freddie Peacock from the inferno along with Russ. Lloyd is left heartbroken when Chris and Cheryl tell him that they are back together. Lloyd throws Chris, Russ and Cheryl out of his house and tells Cheryl he never wants to see her again. Steve speaks to him and tells him that he should not let them get to him; and that if they annoy him, then they have won. The conversation helps Lloyd see sense, and he tells Steve that he is grateful for helping him cope through the confession. Lloyd struggles to cope with losing Cheryl and Russ and at one point he grabs Karl Munro (John Michie) by the throat when he jokes about Cheryl. Lloyd sets fire to his sofa in the street as Cheryl and Chris watch. Lloyd and Chris have a fight and Chris hits his head, Cheryl learns he has been lying about his tumour and decides to leave with Russ. Stella Price (Michelle Collins) helps Lloyd with his taxes and one evening, he misinterprets her concern and tries to kiss her. Stella knocks him back and Lloyd apologises. Lloyd tells Karl about the kiss and subsequently decides to leave Weatherfield and he sells his share of Street Cars to Becky, before departing. Lloyd later sells his house to Steve. Lloyd returns and runs into Steve, who offers him a job and somewhere to live. Lloyd thinks he is being offered half of StreetCars, but Steve reveals that he was just offering him a driving job. Lloyd then sets up a rival taxi firm called Fare Ladies and begins poaching Steve's clients and staff. Lloyd hires Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), but fires her after he realises she has been sabotaging his cars. Lloyd makes up with Steve and starts working for Street Cars again under the basis that they do not mention their earlier arguments. Lloyd becomes enemies with Karl, after he cheats on Stella with Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati). Lloyd fires Karl and refuses to acknowledge his existence, but Karl warns him that he will get him back. In September 2012, Lloyd has a chance encounter at a gig with an old friend, Mandy Kamara (Pamela Nomvete). They get talking, and Mandy reveals that her husband, Johnny (also a good friend of Lloyd's) has recently died and she has moved to Manchester. Lloyd is keen for them to meet up again, but Mandy declines, and asks that Lloyd does not contact her again. He tries to make her acquaintance again by returning a necklace she left in the back of his cab but is startled when she is cold towards him. He once again tries goes to her house, but this time the door is answered by a young woman Lloyd does not recognise. After further attempts to contact Mandy, he finds out that this is her daughter Jenna (Krissi Bohn). Realising from Mandy's attitude towards him, Lloyd works out that Jenna must be his daughter, Lloyd finally confronts Mandy, and it is revealed that she planned to leave her husband for Lloyd many years ago, but her pregnancy kept them together, Lloyd moved away, and Johnny never found out about the affair. When Jenna finds out, she is angry at her mother, who then plans to move back to Nottingham. Lloyd however convinces her to reconcile with Jenna, and move in with him. She grudgingly accepts, but soon warms to Lloyd once again. When Jenna loses her job as a physiotherapist after one of her patients, Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) kisses her, and she does not report it, Lloyd supports her, while Mandy despairs over the career she worked so hard for, now over. Lloyd defends Jenna's choices however, and she makes up with Mandy after coming out as a lesbian, and entering a permanent relationship with Sophie. In July 2013, Lloyd and his family enter the pub and overhear Paul Kershaw (Tony Hirst) make a possibly racist comment whilst playing darts. This causes a rift between Lloyd's family and Paul but Paul's partner, Eileen Grimshaw, is trapped between the two as Lloyd is her colleague and one of her best friends. The argument between the two sides continue, with Eileen determined to end the feud. Sophie, who is involved with Jenna, contacts the fire service where Paul works and makes a formal complaint about his racist remark. Paul finds this out via his manager and believes Lloyd made the complaint as an act of revenge, trying to get him sacked from his job. He subsequently finds Lloyd near the pub, pins him up against the wall and hits him. Jenna is walking across the street and noticed and she subsequently tells Paul that it was Sophie who made the complaint. However, the police are present as they had been called by Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) to investigate problems at his bar. Nick's wife, Leanne, tells the police they are not needed, so they divert their attention to Paul and Lloyd and they take Paul down to the station for questioning due to his violent behaviour. Finally, Paul gives in and apologises to Lloyd, but there is still tension between the two. Mandy and Lloyd's relationship is almost as shaken by Eileen and Paul's. Events escalate and Lloyd and Mandy split. Paul has another encounter with Lloyd when Eileen convinces him and Steve to go out to a bar with Paul for his birthday. They are joined by Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), who seeks to lighten the mood, but the conversation soon turns to Lloyd and Paul. Steve and Brian leave soon after Paul and Lloyd stop talking to each other. Paul goes after them, leaving Lloyd to one last drink. He notices a gang of three men, all pale-skinned, observing him. He begins to chat up the barmaid, who is brown skinned. He invites her out, but then decides to abandon his drink and leave after he sees the unwelcome attention they are attracting. He bumps into Paul, who has come back for him, on the way out, but while distracted, he is surrounded by the men from the pub, who seek to rough him up. Paul intervenes, and one of the men \\"questions his allegiances\\". Paul ignores this, and tells them to back off. They return to the bar, and Paul and Lloyd begin to walk home. Paul apologises to Lloyd, but Lloyd, believing Paul's language instigated the encounter, shuns him, returning home alone. Later, when Paul leaves the street for good, Lloyd and Steve comfort Eileen, to no avail. Lloyd later begins a relationship with Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon), a friend of Steve's from college. Steve is jealous, despite him being in a relationship with Michelle. Andrea later admits to Lloyd that she used to fancy Steve, but she now loves Lloyd, and after many meals at the Bistro, Lloyd forgives Andrea and they reunite. Lloyd and Steve compete in a charity fun-run in memory of Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Steve accidentally trips Lloyd up, but Lloyd accuses him of doing it on purpose to beat him. Steve gets to the finish line first, but when Lloyd arrives, he collapses and suffers a heart attack with the concerned competitors watching in horror. Lloyd is rushed to hospital, where the doctors reveal that he has definitely suffered a heart attack. Andrea is nowhere to be seen, which makes Jenna and Eileen suspicious. He later finds out that Andrea is married however stays with her, when she says she is divorcing her husband, Neil. He tries to win her back but she decides to stay with Lloyd. Jenna however is furious and shows hatred towards Andrea, they soon though begin a better friendship before Jenna decides to leave. Lloyd tries to stop her but lets her go eventually and they part on good terms and he is glad that he met her. A few months later, Andrea and Lloyd break up when she sells one of his records to get money for her daughter. She leaves, but returns later and reveals she is pregnant. Lloyd reunites with Liz, but calls it off when he finds out about Andrea's pregnancy. Liz and Lloyd remain friends. Andrea tells him that she has been offered a job in Jersey and he has a drunken farewell with Steve before saying goodbye to Eileen. Lloyd and Andrea let go of balloons from Coronation Street as everybody cheers and the car drives off. Lloyd and Andrea return a few days later to say goodbye with Steve and share one final hug. In May 2016, Lloyd rang Steve to break the news that Andrea gave birth to a baby girl. Casting The show's producers created the role of Lloyd for Craig Charles to portray. In 2008 it was announced that producers had signed Charles up for a special three-year contract. On 28 May 2011, it was announced Charles would be leaving Coronation Street for a few months in order to film new episodes of Red Dwarf. Laura Armstrong of The People reported Charles would return to the show in 2012. Lloyd made his departure on screen on 15 December 2011. In May 2012, Digital Spy's Tom Eames reported Charles had started filming his comeback episodes for Coronation Street. The following month Charles confirmed that he would be staying with the soap for the foreseeable future and had just signed another contract extension. Charles returned on 2 July. Development On 10 July 2012, Digital Spy's Paul Millar reported Lloyd would discover that he has a daughter. Millar stated that Charles may have teased the upcoming storyline when he appeared on This Morning, saying \\"There's going to be something really iconic for Coronation Street happening to Lloyd. So I'll leave that as a little teaser!\\" The show's producers began casting two actresses to play Lloyd's daughter and his ex-girlfriend. A spokesperson commented that Lloyd has not been contact with the ex-girlfriend for a while and then she turns up and announces that they have a daughter together. They added \\"The news will knock Lloyd for six. His reaction will be pretty explosive.\\" On 26 July, it was announced that Pamela Nomvete and Krissi Bohn had joined the cast as Mandy and Jenna Kamara respectively. Mandy is Lloyd's ex-girlfriend, while Jenna is his daughter.

Reception Following Craig Charles's temporary suspension from the show for drug abuse in 2006, The Guardian columnist Grace Dent spoke positively of the character and her hopes for his eventual return: \\"Love or hate Craig Charles, I thought he was brilliant in Corrie. From the moment Lloyd arrived, he was a breath of fresh air; the perfect foil to Steve McDonald, a friendly face for cab controller Eileen to while away long shifts with, a voice of common sense. Craig, get a grip and come back soon.\\" References External links * Coronation Street characters Fictional Black British people Fictional taxicab drivers Fictional people from Liverpool Television characters introduced in 2005 Male characters in television ","title":"Lloyd Mullaney"},{"id":"5765418","text":"Young Canadian Mothers is an EP by the Canadian musician Owen Pallett, released in 2006 under the name Final Fantasy.

Procedure  The British parliament is bicameral, consisting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Before a Bill can receive the Royal Assent and become law, it must be passed in its final form by both the Commons and the Lords without changes. If one of the Houses makes any change or amendment to it, the other House has to agree to those changes, or make counter-changes of its own (such as reverting to the previous text), in which case it returns to the other House. The debates in each House are usually scheduled weeks or months apart. However, in certain circumstances when there is time pressure, this process can be sped up to less than six hours per chamber. If the two Houses continue to disagree, the process repeats, so the Bill bounces back and forth between the two chambers like a ping-pong ball, until one side backs down or a compromise is found. Usually the time limit is imposed by the end of the Parliamentary session when all parliamentary business, including incomplete Bills, is ended and must start again from scratch in the next session. This usually occurs at the State Opening of Parliament in November; parliament can continue working on the previous year's business up to the night before. Another instance is the wash- up period of a few days between the calling of a general election and the ensuing dissolution of parliament. More rarely, the time limit may be imposed by outside events, such as an impending deadline from a court order, judicial review, or events in foreign affairs.  Example  An extreme example of parliamentary ping-pong involved the Prevention of Terrorism Bill 2005. Over the course of 30 hours on 10-11 March 2005, the Bill was considered five times by the Lords and four times by the Commons. The need for legislation, and associated time pressure, arose from the court case A v Secretary of State for the Home Department. Ten individuals suspected of terrorism had been detained indefinitely under Part IV of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Nine of them appealed against their imprisonment; in December 2004 the Law Lords (then the court of last resort in the UK) granted the appeal, on the grounds that Part IV was incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. The suspects were not freed immediately, as existing powers allowed terrorism suspects to be detained up to 90 days without charge. The judgement effectively set a deadline of 14 March 2005 for parliament to pass alternative legislation which could be applied to the suspects without violating their human rights. In response to the judgement, the government proposed to create control orders, which could be applied to the suspects. The Bill necessary to introduce these powers was tabled in the House of Commons on 22 February 2005. The Bill passed in the Commons, then the Lords amended it to include a sunset clause, which the Commons did not agree with. As parliament would not be sitting over the weekend of 12-13 March, the legislation had to be completed by the end of Friday 11 March. With the deadline approaching, the Bill began to ping-pong between the two Houses. The timetable was: *10 March 2005 ** House of Lords ‚Äî 11:31am to 3:00pm ** House of Commons ‚Äî 6:00pm to 7:37pm ** House of Lords ‚Äî 10:15pm to 11:26pm *11 March 2005 ** House of Commons ‚Äî 1:20am to 2:39am ** House of Lords ‚Äî 5:00am to 5:56am ** House of Commons ‚Äî 8:00am to 9:13am ** House of Lords ‚Äî 11:40am to 1:11pm ** House of Commons ‚Äî 3:30pm to 4:00pm ** House of Lords ‚Äî 6:30pm to 7:00pm A compromise was eventually agreed, involving annual reviews of the law rather than a full sunset clause. Both Houses then passed the Bill, which received Royal Assent at 7:20pm on 11 March 2005.

The establishment of sealer settlements by Europeans in Eastern Bass Strait, including Kent Group, were amongst the earliest outside Sydney Cove. A lighthouse was constructed on Deal Island in 1848, with permanent human habitation until its deactivation in 1992.

During the 1910s and 1920s he played as a goalkeeper for Vasas SC, WAC Vienna, KAFK Kula, MTK Hung√°ria FC, FC Barcelona, Recreativo de Huelva. He subsequently worked as a coach in Europe and South America, most notably with FC Barcelona, Colo- Colo, River Plate, Boca Juniors and Chile. Platko was an early FC Barcelona legend and was a team-mate of Paulino Alc√°ntara, Josep Samitier and Sagibarba. His bravery as a goalkeeper was immortalized by Rafael Alberti in the poem Oda A Platko. After retiring as a player he returned to the club as a coach on two occasions (1934‚Äì35, 1955‚Äì56). He played 6 matches for the Hungarian national team between 1917 and 1923.Ferenc Plattk√≥ at EU-Football.info Career =Early career= Platko began his career as a goalkeeper in his hometown of Budapest with local club Vasas SC in 1917 . After a brief spell at WAC Vienna in 1920, he returned to Vasas for another season. Between 1917 and 1923, Platko also played six games for Hungary.

Both games finished as 0‚Äì0 draws and FC Barcelona, impressed with Platko offered him a contract. = FC Barcelona = Platko replaced the legendary Ricardo Zamora, but soon established himself as a legend in his own right. He spent seven years at FC Barcelona between 1923 and 1930. During that time he won six Campionat de Catalunya titles, three Copa del Rey and the first ever La Liga title. The poem Oda A Platko came about following the Copa del Rey final in 1928. FC Barcelona took three games to beat Real Sociedad and during the first encounter on 20 May, Rafael Alberti was so impressed with the bravery of Platko that he later wrote the poem in his honour. Platko finished his playing career at Recreativo de Huelva and retired as a player in 1931. He soon began his career as a coach, working in France with FC Mulhouse (1932‚Äì33) and Racing Club de Roubaix (1933‚Äì34), before returning to FC Barcelona as a coach for the 1934/35 season. Despite guiding the club to another Campionat de Catalunya, the following season he was replaced by Patrick O'Connell. After two decades away from the club Platko was reappointed coach of CF Barcelona for the 1955/56 season. During this season the club, inspired by Ladislao Kubala and Luis Su√°rez, won 10 consecutive La Liga games in a row. The record remained unbeaten until 2005.

In 1941 he took charge of Chile and continued as national team manager until 1945, coaching the team at both the South American Championship in both 1942 and 1945. During 1942 he also coached two other Chilean clubs, Club Magallanes and Santiago Wanderers. In 1949 he coached Boca Juniors and in 1953 he returned to Colo-Colo for a third time and won a third Chilean Championionship. For the season 1955/56 he returned to FC Barcelona with which he became runner up in the league one point behind Athletic Bilbao. His balance of 22 wins three draws and five defeats had been the best for the club yet. The series of ten straight wins in the league was only outdone under Frank Rijkard in the 2005/06 season. His downfall was a 1‚Äì3 defeat on 20 May in the cup quarterfinals against local rivals Espa√±ol. The club concluded, the relationship between the team and Plattk√≥ was broken, and replaced him for the return match, which ended 4-4, with the club legend Josep Samitier. The next years Plattk√≥ spent in Brazil as talent scout and player observer. later he returned to Chile where in 1965 he took on a last coaching assignment when he took on lowly first division outfit CD San Luis de Quillota from the region of Valpara√≠so, with which he ended third from the bottom, which however was one up from the previous season.

An engine officer, also called an engineering officer or simply engineer, is a licensed mariner qualified and responsible for operating and maintaining the propulsion plants and support systems for a watercraft and its crew, passengers and cargo.Wise Geek: What is the Engine Department on a US Merchant Ship? Engine officers are usually educated and qualified as engineering technicians. Ship engineers are responsible for propulsion and other ship systems such as: electrical power generation plant; lighting; fuel oil; lubrication; water distillation and separation; air conditioning; refrigeration; and water systems on board the vessel. They require knowledge and hands-on experience with electric power, electronics, pneumatics, hydraulics, chemistry, steam generation, gas turbines and even nuclear technology on certain military and civilian vessels. Ranks and titles There are several types and ranks of engine officer that are employed in the engine department of a shipSTCW Requirements for Officers = Watchstanding officers = *Chief engineer: In charge of the engine department. Reports only to the ship's captain. *Second engineer: In charge of the day-to-day running of the engine department. Often in charge of main engine maintenance. Takes the 4‚Äì8 watch. *Third engineer: Usually in charge auxiliary engines & boilers. Takes the 12‚Äì4 watch. *Fourth engineer: Usually in charge of air compressors, purifiers, pumps and other auxiliary machinery. Takes the 8‚Äì12 watch. Sometimes in charge of boilers. = Electrical officers = Electrical officers do not participate in watchstanding of the engine department, but are present on more sophisticated vessels to take charge of electronic and electrical equipment *Electro-technical officer (ETO): Officer who is responsible for the maintenance of electronic equipment including automation systems and instrumentation process and control equipment, and/or general electrical equipment. Reports to Chief Engineer. * Electrical officer: Officer who is responsible for the maintenance of general electrical equipment such as motors, transformers, lights, reefer outlets etc. Reports to ETO / Chief Engineer. = Other positions = * Junior engineer: Officer who is qualified as fourth engineer but lacks the experience to take a watch. Assists with all engine department duties. * Engine/ETO cadet: A trainee engine officer or ETO. Understudies the other engine department personnel. Cadets of most countries are sponsored during training by a shipping company, serving their time on board ships owned by that company. Many go on to work as engine officers with their sponsoring company once training is complete.  United States naval use  United States Navy ships have a varying number of engine officers, depending upon the size of the crew, occupying positions named for subsidiary responsibilities of the Engineering Officer. The two highest ranking subordinates are usually the Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA), responsible for operation and maintenance of propulsion machinery, and the Damage Control Assistant (DCA), responsible for prevention and control of damage. Anticipation of battle damage increases the significance of responsibilities of the latter position on warships. A DCA often stands routine deck or engineering watches, but spends his off-watch time overseeing maintenance of watertight integrity and firefighting equipment. A DCA's battle station normally includes responsibility for controlling the ship's stability, list and trim by flooding and dewatering undamaged compartments as necessary to prevent capsizing. Additional engine officers may include an Electrical Officer, responsible for the ship's electrical generating and distribution system as described above, and an Auxiliaries (or A Division) Officer, responsible for pumps, ventilation blowers, refrigeration compressors, and windlass machinery as described above for the Fourth Engineer.

Last updated in May, 2012. Machon is a tool to implement a common vision through Zionist youth movements. Machon integrates the methods of informal outreach, appropriate to the world of youth movements, with a focus on formal and content-driven activities to develop a sense of commitment to themselves, their communities, Israel and the Jewish people. All this in order to foster graduates of the programs to become agents of change in their home communities and encourage them to contribute in different ways to transform Israel as a state and strengthen its Jewish and democratic identity. Basics The Machon Le Madrichim (MLM) holds four core believes:Machon Le Madrichim, History and Rationale. Updated on May, 2012. #Guided by content: A belief that to become an effective Jewish leader, and also for education and culture per se, members must possess a basic understanding of core content areas of Jewish life and particularly the place of Israel within the Jewish people. The contents of the MLM program is organized around five areas: Zionism, Jewish history, Judaism, Leadership and Hebrew. The objective is not limited only to the acquisition of knowledge, but based on the same development of self-understanding and values which in turn lead to actions. #Leadership and action: MLM believes in the importance of the development of Jewish leadership and activists around the world, both in the short term, as hadracha (leadership) providers and activities in their own movements, answering the needs of key partners in the youth movements, and in the long term, the development of effective leadership for the Jewish people in Israel and the Jewish diaspora. MLM graduates return to their communities and become active in leadership positions, while working with a wide variety of organizations and youth movements. Stressing the importance of training agents of social change and that these leaders should be treated with mutual respect. #Open and pluralistic environment: MLM believes that the essential component in developing Jewish guides and educators is an open educational vision that is able to challenge existing beliefs and opinions and encourage openness to new ideas and different beliefs, whether it's in the political, religious or educational arenas. MLM aims at creating an environment where members can connect with Jews who come from diverse backgrounds and beliefs and learn from each other in an atmosphere of tolerance and acceptance. At the center of this vision is the attempt to create a truly diverse educational community, and creating a space to provide for each individual's personal development process, from which they can choose their own path. #Development of core commitments: MLM believes in the importance of community as the principle of kol Israel arevim ze laze (\\"all Jews are responsible for each other\\"), and its graduates have an active commitment and involvement with the Jewish people with Israel at its center. The graduates examine, define, and strengthen their Jewish identity, their connection with the various dimensions of Israel and within that to develop a love of Israel and learning what the meaning of Zionism is for them, including the belief in the importance of building relationships and true cooperation between Israelis and Jews outside of Israel. History The Machon opened in 1946, at the initiative of World Zionist Organization (WZO) before the creation of the state of Israel. At that time the main mission was for Machon to be a training program for youth movement graduates outside of Israel, to help them meet the central challenge of Zionism, to encourage allies and settlement in Israel as the main objectives of the movements. The first group of students, 30 Jewish high school graduates from South Africa, were housed at an agricultural school near Ness Ziona. In 1949, the Machon moved to a building in the Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem. Since 1972, it has usually been located in East Talpiot. During its history, 17,000 young people from around the world have been trained to occupy influential positions among the Jewish people. The contribution of the Machon graduates can be found in the leadership of Jewish communities in Jewish-Zionist education, as well as in public life in Israel. Almost a third of Machon graduates made Aliyah and were integrated into different areas of life in Israel, and have had a significant influence on the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Participants have traveled from most countries of South and Central America, Australia and New Zealand, United States and Canada, South Africa, North Africa, France, Great Britain and many others countries from the 1950s, and more recently from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Structure At this time, Machon is composed of four departments that serve more than 500 students per year. Each of the departments works with different audiences and to its values and principles, specifically: #English speakers #Latin American languages (Spanish, Portuguese) speakers #Russian speakers #Machon Ma'ayan (religious division) There was also for some time a program for French speakers. =Machon English-speakers= Works with the majority of youth movements in the English-speaking world. It operates two cycles per year ‚Äì The cycle north to the students from England, Europe and the United States, conducted between September and December; the student cycle geared to Australia and South Africa is conducted between February and June. In total, approximately 120 English speakers complete the program each year. Since 2006, there has been a small group of Israeli students that join the British program (known as \\"P2K\\" or \\"Shutfut 2000\\"), coming from the area of the Galilee. =Latin America= Works with ten youth groups from ten countries in Central and South America. It also works in two cycles per year ‚Äì the first conducted between March and June, and the second between September and December. In total, over 300 youth leaders complete this program, known as \\"Machon Amla't\\" each year. Program The Machon offers 17- to 19-year-olds an intensive one-year program to strengthen their leadership skills and enhance their knowledge of Judaism, Zionism, Jewish history, Hebrew and Israeli society. The program includes touring, volunteer work in development towns and kibbutzim, and encounters with Israelis to strengthen ties to Israel. * Groups (Chavura). Most departments divide the members into small groups of about 20 students each called \\"chavurot\\" (groups). There are the core groups in the Machon structure that function on a smaller scale and has at least two weekly meetings that help students to feel \\"at home\\" within the plan. Each is led by a group educator. * Community involvement and volunteering. In almost all departments a half a day is spent on involvement in the wider community of Israel. This involvement can take the form of volunteer work with the elderly, the disabled or at-risk populations. Students are taught how to implement political and social action, to understand and act others and thus promote important issues or values in Israel. Meetings are held with various groups of Israelis, for example, soldiers in the army, Ethiopian immigrants, Arab-Israelis and Orthodox Jews. * Tours and activities. Each department has 3-4 day trips to different parts of Israel, especially the north and south. There are also weekly excursions to visit interesting places in Jerusalem and in the downtown area of the country. * Acculturation time. Various departments work together with the youth movements spending half a day per week at a time when groups of different movements, building a cultural identity, and debating relevant ideological and educational issues that interest each group.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians. Early life Tom Gorzelanny was born to Susan and Bob Gorzelanny in Evergreen Park, Illinois and grew up in Chicago and Oak Forest, Illinois. He graduated from Marist High School in 2000. Professional career =Pittsburgh Pirates= Gorzelanny was drafted in the 38th round of the 2000 MLB Draft by the Chicago White Sox but chose to play college baseball rather than immediately pursuing a professional career. He redshirted in his first year at University of Kansas and posted 3‚Äì7 record with a 5.90 earned run average as a freshman with the Kansas Jayhawks. Gorzelanny was ruled academically ineligible prior to his sophomore season and transferred to Triton College, a community college in Illinois. He was drafted from Triton in the second round (45th overall) of the 2003 MLB Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Gorzelanny began his career in with the Double-A Altoona Curve. He made his Major League debut with the Pirates in September, starting against the Houston Astros and pitching 4‚Öì innings, receiving the loss. At the beginning of the season, he was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. Gorzelanny was selected to play for the US team in the 2006 All-Star Futures Game, but was ineligible due to being called up by the Pirates. On June 29, 2006, the Pirates called Gorzelanny up to replace Oliver P√©rez in the starting rotation. He made his season debut on July 1, 2006 against the Detroit Tigers. In 11 games, he was 2‚Äì5 with a 3.79 ERA. Gorzelanny earned a regular spot in the rotation in the season. He was one of five players in the National League that would be chosen from a final fan vote for the last spot on the NL roster for the 2007 MLB All-Star Game. Gorzelanny went on to compile a 14‚Äì10 season for the Pirates, leading the Pirates in wins and finishing with over 200 innings and an ERA of 3.88. In , Gorzelanny suffered from control problems with his pitches, walking 61 batters and giving up 99 hits in his first 87‚Öî innings of work. After a difficult start to the first half of the season, Gorzelanny was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis in July. He was recalled to Pittsburgh several weeks later after a successful tenure in Indianapolis, but ultimately failed to regain his 2007 form. He finished the 2008 season 6‚Äì9 with a 6.66 ERA. After Spring Training, Gorzelanny began the season at Triple-A Indianapolis. In May, he was recalled to pitch from the bullpen after injuries to the Pirates' roster. He was optioned back to Triple-A after several weeks with Pittsburgh. In nine appearances with Pittsburgh, he was 3‚Äì1 with a 5.19 ERA. =Chicago Cubs= Gorzelanny pitching for the Chicago Cubs in . Gorzelanny was traded on July 30, 2009 to the Chicago Cubs along with John Grabow for Kevin Hart, Jos√© Ascanio, and minor league third baseman Josh Harrison, and assigned to the Chicago Cubs Triple-A affiliate, the Iowa Cubs. He was called up to start on August 4, 2009, and got his first win as a Cub. He went on to make seven starts for the Cubs, earning a record of 4‚Äì2 and ending the season in the bullpen. Between the Pirates and the Cubs, he was 7‚Äì3 with a 5.55 ERA in 2009. In , Gorzelanny won a spot in the Cubs starting rotation. In late May, he was moved to the bullpen to accommodate the return of Carlos Zambrano to the Cubs rotation. On June 26, 2010, Cubs manager Lou Piniella announced that Zambrano would move back to the bullpen, and Gorzelanny would regain a spot in the Cubs rotation. Even after Zambrano made his second return to the rotation after undergoing anger management therapy, Gorzelanny kept his spot in the rotation. In 29 appearances, including 23 starts, in 2010, he was 7‚Äì9 with a 4.09 ERA. =Washington Nationals= On January 17, 2011, the Washington Nationals acquired Gorzelanny from the Cubs for prospects Michael Burgess, A. J. Morris, and Graham Hicks. Gorzelanny became expendable to the Cubs after they traded for Matt Garza ten days earlier. On May 28, 2011, Gorzelanny was placed on the 15-day disabled list with left elbow inflammation. After coming off the DL, he was less consistent and was removed from the rotation, and was used in long relief out of the bullpen. He started in 15 games for the Nationals and pitched in 15 more in 2011, compiling a 4‚Äì6 record and a 4.03 ERA. In 2012, Gorzelanny pitched almost exclusively out of the Nationals bullpen; he started one game, the second to last game of the season, and received a no decision. In 45 appearances in 2012, 44 of them out of the bullpen, Gorzelanny was 4‚Äì2 with a 2.88 ERA over 72 innings. =Milwaukee Brewers= Gorzelanny pitching for the Milwaukee Brewers in 2014. On December 20, 2012, the Milwaukee Brewers and Gorzelanny agreed to a two-year contract. The deal became official on December 21, 2012. As of the 2013 All-Star Break, Gorzelanny was having the best season of his career, statistically speaking. He entered the break with a 1.88 ERA in 35 appearances, three of them starts. =Detroit Tigers= On January 6, 2015, Gorzelanny signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers. He was designated for assignment by the Tigers on July 3. Gorzelanny gave up 17 runs on 32 hits over 24 innings, walking 15 and striking out 19. Opponents batted .390 on balls put in play. On July 8, he was outrighted to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. =Cleveland Indians= Gorzelanny signed a minor league contract, that included an invitation to major league spring training, with the Cleveland Indians in December 2015. He opened the 2016 season with the Columbus Clippers, and was promoted to the major leagues on June 1. He was designated for assignment on July 4 and subsequently outrighted to Columbus on July 8. On July 9, Gorzelanny declined the outright assignment and became a free agent. =Baltimore Orioles= On July 24, 2016, the Baltimore Orioles signed Gorzelanny to a minor league contract. He was released on August 13, 2016. =New York Mets= On February 3, 2017 the New York Mets signed Gorzelanny to a minor league contract. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017.

An Armstrong gun was a uniquely designed type of rifled breech-loading field and heavy gun designed by Sir William Armstrong and manufactured in England beginning in 1855 by the Elswick Ordnance Company and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. Such guns involved a built-up gun construction system of a wrought-iron (later of mild steel) tube surrounded by multiple wrought-iron strengthening coils shrunk over the inner tube to keep it under compression. The Armstrong rifled breechloading guns of the 1850s-1860s In 1854, Armstrong approached the Secretary of State for War, proposing that he construct a rifled breech- loading 3-pounder gun for trial. Later increased in bore to 5-pounder, the design performed successfully with respect to both range and accuracy. Over the next three years he developed his system of construction and adapted it to guns of heavier calibre. Armstrong's system was adopted in 1858, initially for \\"special service in the field\\" and initially he only produced smaller artillery pieces, 6-pounder (2.5 in/64 mm) mountain or light field guns, 9-pounder (3 in/76 mm) guns for horse artillery, and 12-pounder (3 inches /76 mm) field guns. Armstrong did not consider his system suited to heavier guns but higher authorities had him develop a 20-pounder (3.75 inches /95 mm) field & naval gun, a 40-pounder () siege gun, and a 110-pounder (7 inches /180 mm) heavy gun. The Royal Navy used all these guns and all except the 20-pounder saw service in New Zealand. =Armstrong breech-loading system= 7-inch 110lb Armstrong gun on HMS Warrior Screw breech system of 7-inch Armstrong gun Powder cartridge with lubricator Armstrong's guns used a \\"built-up\\" construction, comprising a central \\"A\\" tube (initially of wrought iron, and from 1863 of mild steel toughened in oil) holding the bore over which were shrunk several wrought iron coils which kept the central tube under compression,Holley states that Daniel Treadwell first patented the concept of a central steel tube kept under compression by wrought-iron coils.. and that Armstrong's assertion that he (Armstrong) first used a wrought-iron A-tube and hence did not infringe the patent, was disingenuous, as the main point in Treadwell's patent was the tension exerted by the wrought-iron coils, which Armstrong used in exactly the same fashion. Holley, Treatise on Ordnance and Armour, 1865, pages 863‚Äì870 a breech-piece, and a trunnion ring.Armstrong Rifled Breech Loading (RBL) 6-Pounder The guns' rifling was on the \\"polygroove\\" system; the bore of the gun had 38 grooves along its length with a twist of one turn per 38 calibres. The cast iron shell, similar in shape to a Mini√© ball, had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell. This system had just been developed by Martin von Wahrendorff and Giovanni Cavalli in Sweden. This spin, together with the elimination of windage as a result of the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smoothbore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge. On top of each gunpowder cartridge was a \\"lubricator\\" consisting of tallow and linseed oil between two tin plates, backed by a felt wad coated with beeswax and finally by millboard. The lubricator followed the shell down the bore, the lubricant was squeezed out between the tin plates and the wad behind it cleaned out any lead deposits left from the shell coating leaving the bore clean for the next round.Treatise on Ammunition 1877, pages 166‚Äì167 An innovative feature which is more usually associated with 20th-century guns was what Armstrong called its \\"grip\\", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel and at the same time slightly swaged down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities. The Armstrong breech loaders used a vertical sliding block, called a vent-piece, which had a conical copper-ringed plug on its front surface which sealed the firing chamber, to close the breech. To hold both block and plug tightly in place the guns used a hollow breech screw (hence the name \\"screw breech\\") behind the block, which the gunner rotated to tighten and seal the breech before firing. To load and fire the gun: * The breech screw was turned to loosen it * The vent-piece was raised * The shell was inserted through the hollow breech-screw and rammed home into the bore * The powder cartridge was inserted through the breech- screw into the chamber * A primer tube was inserted into the vent piece (only necessary for the 40-pounder and 110-pounder due to the size) * The vent-piece was lowered * The breech-screw was tightened * A friction tube with lanyard attached was inserted in the hole at the top of the vent-piece * The gunner pulled the lanyard which ignited a gunpowder charge in the vent tube, the flash passed through the vent in the vent-piece, assisted by the primer if present, into the powder chamber and ignited the gunpowder charge =Armstrong guns in action= The British used Armstrong guns extensively to great effect in the Second Opium War. As reported by the translator Robert Swinhoe, after the British attack on the Chinese fort at Pehtang: > Numbers of dead Chinese lay about the guns, some most fearfully lacerated. > The wall afforded very little protection to the Tartar gunners, and it was > astonishing how they managed to stand so long against the destructive fire > that our Armstrongs poured on them; but I observed, in more instances than > one, that the unfortunate creatures had been tied to the guns by the > legs.Robert Swinhoe, Narrative of the North China Campaign of 1860 (London: > Smith, Elder & Co, 1861) p. 105. The Armstrong gun‚Äîmainly the 12 pounder‚Äîwas used extensively in the 1863 conflict in New Zealand between British troops and Maori in the Waikato. A well preserved 12-pounder which was used in the battle of Rangiriri is at the Te Awamutu museum. The barrel can traverse 6 degrees left or right without moving the gun carriage. The wheels are wooden with a 75 mm wide steel band. The wheel diameter is 1.7 m. The track width is 1.8 m. Barrel width at the muzzle is 140 mm. Such was the confidence of the army in the accuracy of the gun that at the battle of Hairini Ridge the artillery was fired over the heads of the advancing infantry as they stormed the ridge. The infantry took cover in a slight depression in the ground in front of the Maori trenches and then stormed the trenches when the shelling stopped. On July 4, 1868 Armstrong guns were used at the Battle of Ueno by forces supporting the Imperial government of Japan. Armstrong guns were used against British and Indian troops during the Second Anglo-Afghan War in the Battle of Charasiab, in which Howard Hensman describes six being captured by a combined Anglo-Indian expedition under the command of Brigadier-General Baker.Howard Hensman Afghan War of 1979-80 (London, W.H. Allen & Co., 1882) p. 35. Return to muzzle-loading guns In 1863 an Ordnance Select committee met to consider the merits of muzzle-loading and breech-loading guns. In 1864, even before they had concluded their investigations, the Government stopped the manufacture of Armstrong breech-loaders. When the Committee finally reported, in August 1865, they announced that: Fort No 1, L√©vis, Quebec, Canada Their report did admit that Armstrong's guns, while more expensive, were undoubtedly safer in that while it was not uncommon for cast iron muzzle-loaders to burst, not one Armstrong gun had ever done so. (Furthermore, gunners could clear a hang fire from the breech; when the RML 17.72 inch gun at Napier of Magdala Battery at Gibraltar hung fire, a gunner had to be lowered head-first down the bore to attach an extractor to the shell.) Despite a further report which remarked on the advantages of breech-loaders, cost dominated the proceedings and the Committee finally announced that \\"The balance of advantages is in favour of muzzle-loading field guns\\", and in 1865 Britain reverted from breech-loading ordnance to muzzle-loading. Tests conducted in 1859 with the Armstrong 40-pounder, and again in 1869 with the Armstrong rifled 100-pounder had demonstrated that neither rifled cannon was capable of penetrating 4 inches of armour, even at as little as 50 yards. This was crucial because Britain, as a maritime power, relied for its security on the ability of its naval ordnance to defeat any new armour-protected warships being developed by potential enemy powers. Armstrong developed an alternative horizontal sliding wedge version of his breechloader, for 40-pounder and 64-pounder guns, in an attempt to address the limitations of the screw breech, but the Government had already decided to return to muzzle-loading guns. To allow rifling to be used with muzzle- loaders, Armstrong proposed in 1866 a new system whereby the shells had studs on the outside, which aligned with grooves in the barrel of the cannon. This was adopted by the Government for the first generation of rifled muzzle- loaders, termed \\"RML\\", together with Armstrong's built-up wrought-iron construction method, which was considered sound. Later Armstrong breechloaders 6-inch breechloading disappearing gun of the 1880s at the Chulachomklao fort, Samut Prakan, Thailand Armstrong returned to the manufacture of breechloaders in the 1880s, using an interrupted thread breech with its own \\"Armstrong cup\\" and later the de Bange methods of sealing the bore which relied upon the power of the gun's firing to effect the gas seal (\\"obturation\\") rather than the manual labour in the 1858 design. It was a major supplier of modern \\"BL\\" guns to the Royal Navy, British Army and the world export market until the 1920s. However, it is its earlier generations of \\"RBL\\" guns that are typically referred to as \\"Armstrong guns\\". See also * Rifled breech loader * Disappearing gun for the Armstrong Disappearing Gun.

He emigrated to America in 1910, with a company headed by Gertrude Elliott. He was initially billed as Pat Creighton Hale in the United States. Remaining in the country, he acted in stock theater in Hartford, Indianapolis, and other cities. While starring in Charles Frohman's Broadway production of Indian Summer, Hale was spotted by a representative of the Pathe Film Company. He eventually became known professionally as Creighton Hale, although the derivation of those names remains unknown. His first movie was The Exploits of Elaine (1914). He starred in hit films such as Way Down East, Orphans of the Storm, and The Cat and the Canary. It was thought that in 1923 Hale starred in an early pornographic \\"stag\\" film On the Beach (a.k.a. Getting His Goat and The Goat Man).The Goat Man (1923), IMDb. Retrieved 16 August 2015. In the film, three nude women agree to have sex with him, but only through a hole in a fence. Photographs of the scene clearly show that the man in the film is not Hale, but is another actor who also wore glasses.Biography with comparison photos of Hale and \\"The Goat Man\\", UnsungJoe website. Retrieved 16 August 2015. When talkies came about, his career declined. He made several appearances in Hal Roach's Our Gang series (School's Out, Big Ears, Free Wheeling), and also played uncredited bits in major talking films such as Larceny, Inc., The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Personal life His two sons, Creighton Hale Jr. and Robert Lowe Hale, from his first marriage to Victoire Lowe were adopted by Lowe's second husband, actor John Miljan. After his divorce, Hale married Kathleen Bering in Los Angeles in 1931. He died in South Pasadena at age 83 and was buried at Duncans Mills Cemetery in Northern California.

The duo claim it took them 7 years to finish. It contains many short tracks and a long track listing.  Overview  Highlights include the song \\"Fly Me To New York\\", a satirical political swipe at the 9/11 bombing, which includes Frank Sinatra's voice cut up to create the dialog. Joliver is a cut up of various Jamie Oliver samples, proclaiming himself to be a 'tosser', whilst 'Nogged Out with Sharon Davies' transforms David Bowie's 'Space Oddity' to hilarious effect. 'Pasta Rasta's Camo Visor Advisor (Revised)' is a cut up version of the song 'Camouflage' by Stan Ridgeway. 'Old Time Romantic Doves' chops up Lee Dorsey's 'Get Out My Life, Woman', whilst 'Dancing with Manatees' uses elements of Aphex Twin's 'Every Day'.

It is a narrow sand spitBowman, G. & Harvey, N. (1986): Geomorphic Evolution of a Holocene Beach-Ridge Complex, LeFevre Peninsula, South Australia. Journal of Coastal Research 2(3):345-362 of about 30 square kilometres running north from its connection to the mainland. Location and extent Lefevre Peninsula, with a population of approximately 30,000 residents, is located on the east coast of Gulf St Vincent about north-west of the Adelaide city centre. The peninsula is bounded to the west by Gulf St Vincent and to the north and the east by the Port River. The southern boundary of the ‚Äútopographical peninsula‚Äù has been determined by the Surveyor General of South Australia as being Recreation Road in the suburb of Semaphore Park as ‚Äúan examination of old plans indicate that boats could have navigated the Port Adelaide River to approximately this point.‚Äù Description The western, Gulf St Vincent, coast of the peninsula consists of a continuous stretch of fine, white sand beaches. The eastern side is defined and separated from the mainland by the Barker Inlet and Port River. Torrens Island lies nearby to the east. To the east of the base of the peninsula is the suburb of Port Adelaide. Much of the peninsula has been developed, with residential areas extending inland from the western beaches, and heavy industries concentrated along the Port River waterfront on its eastern shore. The peninsula has strong maritime associations due to its proximity to Port Adelaide, the Port River and Outer Harbor. Collins class submarines were built at the suburb of Osborne. Cement production also occurs on the peninsula at Birkenhead. In 1999, the Pelican Point Power Station was established at the northeastern tip of the peninsula adjacent to the Port River.Pelican Point Power Station, International Power plc Australia, 2007. Lefevre Peninsula also contains several sailing clubs and golf clubs and the popular Semaphore Road foreshore. The Outer Harbor railway line runs through the peninsula from Ethelton to Outer Harbor. Naming It was named by Governor John Hindmarsh on 3 June 1837 after Sir John George Shaw-Lefevre, who was one of South Australia's Colonisation Commissioners. History =European use= European settlement commenced in the early 1840s. Before it was developed, much of the coastline was covered with mangroves. The land was extensively covered with bush, with such plants as wattle, sheoak and other native species. The peninsula now has a wind swept feel due to the clearance of these plants. Governance The Lefevre Peninsula is located within the local government area of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, the state electoral districts of Lee and Port Adelaide and the federal division of Hindmarsh. The following suburbs are located on the Lefevre Peninsula: Birkenhead, Ethelton, Exeter, Glanville, Largs Bay, Largs North, New Port, North Haven, Osborne, Outer Harbor, Peterhead, Semaphore, the northern end of Semaphore Park, Semaphore South and Taperoo.

An ex-wife tried to take advantage of the principle that had been reintroduced in the High Trees case to enforce her husband's promise to give her maintenance. The Court held that promissory estoppel could not be applied. It was available only as a defence and not as a cause of action. Facts Mr and Mrs Combe were a married couple. Mr Yasser M Combe promised Mrs Radhika M Combe that he would pay her an annual maintenance. Their marriage eventually fell apart and they were divorced. Mr Combe refused to pay any of the maintenance he had promised. Seven years later Ms Combe brought an action against Mr Combe to have the promise enforced. There was no consideration in exchange for the promise and so no contract was formed. Instead, she argued promissory estoppel as she had acted on the promise to her own detriment. At first instance the Court agreed with Mrs Combe and enforced the promise under promissory estoppel. However this decision was then appealed. Judgment Denning LJ reversed the lower court decision and ruled in favour of Mr Combe. He elaborated on the \\"Rule in High Trees House\\", Stating the legal principle, Denning wrote, He stated the estoppel could only be used as a \\"shield\\" and not a \\"sword\\". In the High Trees case, there was an underlying cause of action outside the promise. Here, promissory estoppel created the cause of action where there was none. In this case, the court could not find any consideration for the promise to pay maintenance. He further stated that the High Trees principle should not be stretched so far as to abolish the doctrine of consideration, While it may be true that the wife did forbear from suing the husband on the arrears for seven years, this forbearance was not at the request of the husband. He held that in the absence of proof of any request, express or implied, by the husband that the wife should forbear from applying to the court for maintenance, there was no consideration for the husband's promise. Moreover, even if the wife had promised to not apply to court for maintenance, there would have been no consideration, because one cannot waive the statutory right to apply for maintenance.

Career Having begun his career as an extra in theatre-productions, Hamilton first appeared on film in 1913, doing various uncredited roles in one-reel comedies.IMDb: Lloyd Hamilton - Biography A year later, in 1914, he teamed up with comedian Bud Duncan, and for the next three years the two performers appeared as comedy team Ham and Bud in numerous one-reelers produced by the Kalem Company. Hamilton and Duncan split up in 1917, Hamilton joining Fox as a solo performer. During the next few years he developed a distinct comic persona, appearing as a slightly prissy, overgrown boy often wearing a checkered cap. By the early 1920s, Hamilton was considered a major star of short comedies. His skills were admired by his fellow comedians, thus contributing to his reputation as a comedian's comedian; according to Oscar Levant, Charlie Chaplin singled him out as the one actor of whom he was jealous.Oscar Levant, The Unimportance of Being Oscar, Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P. Putnam 1968), p. 104. . Buster Keaton in an interview praised him as \\"one of the funniest men in pictures,\\" while Charley Chase, who early in his career had directed Hamilton in a number of short subjects, stated that he would often ask himself \\"how would 'Ham' Hamilton play this?\\" before shooting a scene. His films often have surreal touches: in The Movies he tearfully bids goodbye to his mother to go to the city, turns his back on the family farm, and steps directly into the city which is right next door. In Move Along he neatly lays his trousers in the street, to have a steamroller press them. By 1924, Hamilton had become popular enough that it was decided he should do the transition to feature-length comedies. The five-reel comedy which resulted, His Darker Self (1924), was a flop both with critics and audiences, and Hamilton hastily returned to making two-reelers. After the failure of his first feature-length film, coupled with an increasing alcohol addiction, Hamilton is reported to have become more indifferent to his career, and his films from the later silent era are often considered more uneven in quality than his work in the early 1920s. In 1927, Hamilton was in a speakeasy when a boxer was murdered (Hamilton was not a suspect), and after the incident the motion picture authorities banned him from pictures for over a year. By 1929 he was back on screen in talking pictures (his speaking voice being a nasal tenor that fit his finicky screen character) but his continued drinking affected his health. Hamilton's last starring series was a string of two-reel comedies produced by Mack Sennett. He continued to play the hapless victim of circumstance, as in Too Many Highballs where Hamilton tries to park his car and keeps getting boxed in by motorists. When the Sennett series lapsed, there was talk of Hamilton joining the Hal Roach studio, but Roach knew of Hamilton's notorious alcohol abuse and declined to hire him. Hamilton's facial features had acquired deep lines and hollows from heavy drinking, and he no longer looked like the \\"overgrown boy\\" in his final films. Relatively few of Hamilton's silent films from the 1920s survive; they were produced by Educational Pictures, which suffered a laboratory fire in 1937. Those of Hamilton's films that do exist are often prized by comedy collectors and silent-film enthusiasts. Personal life Hamilton was married twice. He married Ethel Lloyd Hamilton in May 1913; the couple had become estranged by the early 1920s, and divorced in 1926. The year after, in June 1927, he married Irene Dalton, an actress who had appeared as his leading lady in several two-reelers. The marriage to Dalton quickly became troubled, however, and they were divorced by 1928. Hamilton had no children. During the 1920s, Hamilton became a heavy drinker, and it has long been claimed that he would often turn rather violent when intoxicated. However, in Anthony Balducci's biography on Hamilton (McFarland & Company, 2009) the author argues that there exists no specific evidence anywhere of Hamilton having been physically violent. According to director Charles Lamont, who knew Hamilton personally for several years, Hamilton was \\"a friendly and amiable fellow; unfortunately, he overindulged in his drinking.\\"Balducci, Anthony (2009), Lloyd Hamilton: Poor Boy Comedian of Silent Cinema, McFarland 978-0-7864-4159-4, p. 145 Hamilton died in January 1935, during an operation for what was described as \\"stomach troubles.\\" Legacy Herbert Sydney Foxwell created a celebrity comic about him for the magazine Kinema Comic in 1920.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/foxwell_herbert.htm Hamilton was honored with a \\"star\\" on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6161 Hollywood Boulevard.

The clash menace is one that might fall under a winner in the opposite hand, because it can be covered by another card in an opponent's hand. If the clash squeeze can force the opponent to discard his guard, then the clash menace can be cashed separately from the winner opposite. For example, consider this layout of the spade suit: The Q is the clash menace. If, when South plays another suit, West can be forced to discard the K, then the Q and the A can be cashed on separate tricks. Notice the presence of the 2, a companion that releases the clash menace to be cashed separately from the A. The 2 also serves as a simple menace against East, requiring West to retain his clash-menace guard to allow his partner to guard the suit.Coups Finesses Squeezes and Other Strategems, Henry B. Anderson, p.182 Clash squeezes were described and analyzed by Chien-Hwa Wang in Bridge Magazine, in 1956 and 1957. Examples Here is a simple, positional clash squeeze, with the 8 as the clash menace: South leads the 6. If West discards the J, the 10 becomes a winner. If West discards a diamond, the 3 is discarded and the J and 8 are cashed. If West discards the 9, South discards dummy's 8 and cashes the 8. Then the 3 to dummy allows the 10 to score. Note the presence of the Vise theme. This is a secondary clash squeeze: South cashes the J. If West discards a spade, South will make one of his small spades. If West discards a club, one of dummy's clubs will become a winner. And if West discards the 9, South cashes the clash menace, the 8. Here is a simultaneous, double clash squeeze: South leads the J and West is clash squeezed. Discarding the J gives up immediately. If West discards a heart, South cashes the 10 and 7 before crossing to the J for the J. If West discards a diamond, South discards the 10 and East is squeezed in the reds. Finally, here's a non- simultaneous double clash squeeze: This double clash squeeze consists of a clash squeeze against West, followed two tricks later by a simple squeeze against East. South leads the J. West cannot throw the 10 because that establishes South's clash menace, and a spade sets up North's spades. So West throws the J. Now South cashes the 10 and the J, in that order, to squeeze East in hearts and clubs. There are other positions, including trump squeezes with clash menaces.

The Saskatchewan Roughriders won their first Grey Cup after 53 years of competition for this trophy, after losing eight times. With Eagle Keys as head coach the Roughriders defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders led by Frank Clair by a score of 29-14. George Reed was the MVP with 31 rushes for 133 yards and one rushing touchdown. Ottawa lost despite two TD passes of over 60 yards to the speedy long-ball threat Whit Tucker. The gooseneck or slingshot field goal posts, invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman, were installed for this game, marking its first appearance in a football championship game. They made their debut a week earlier at Montreal's new Autostade for the Eastern Conference finals. The game was called with four seconds left in regulation when fans swarmed the field in celebration. Starting quarterbacks Ron Lancaster threw three touchdown passes for Saskatchewan while Russ Jackson had two for Ottawa. It was the only Grey cup win as a starter in Lancaster's career, as he lost his four subsequent Grey Cup appearances in 1967, 1969, 1972, and 1976, the first two under Eagle Keys as head coach, and the last two under Dave Skrien and John Payne, respectively. It was also the only Grey Cup loss in Jackson's career, who was the starting quarterback for Ottawa victories in the 48th Grey Cup of 1960 (of which Lancaster served as Jackson's backup quarterback for Ottawa), the 56th Grey Cup of 1968, and the 57th Grey Cup of 1969, his final year, all under head coach Frank Clair.

The PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions were developed by Heavy Iron Studios. The Game Boy Advance version was developed by WayForward Technologies. The Microsoft Windows version was developed by AWE Games. Most of the film's cast reprise their roles. According to Metacritic, the game received mixed to favorable reviews. The game was ported to the PlayStation 3 in 2012. Plot The plot of the video game is based on the film, albeit liberties are taken occasionally. King Neptune's crown has been stolen by Plankton and SpongeBob and Patrick must retrieve it from Shell City and save Bikini Bottom. =Console versions= The gameplay is similar to that from Heavy Iron Studios' previous game, Battle for Bikini Bottom, as it was created using the same engine and shares many assets. There are 18 levels in the game that loosely follow the storyline of the film. The player controls SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, both of whom have their own unique set of abilities. Each level contains a main objective and side tasks. Four levels involve a boss enemy that the player must defeat to progress to the next level. Boss enemies include the giant frogfish from the film, Dennis (who is fought twice), and King Neptune. Each main level and side task will give the player a Goofy Goober Token once completed, and the player needs these tokens to learn certain skills and proceed to the game. Although the player only needs to complete a level's main component in order to unlock the next level, it is not possible to complete the game only doing the main levels (though the player does not need to do all of the side tasks). There is also an upgrade system in the game. As the player collects \\"Manliness Points\\" (represented by glowing weights), they will learn new moves for SpongeBob and Patrick which are needed to complete the game. Once the player collects enough manliness points, they get an \\"Upgrade Point\\" which can improve a skill's effect (or be used to increase the player's Max Health from three to up to six units). Although very helpful in progressing and completing the game, upgrades are not mandatory to doing so. The game does not use a life system; if the player dies, they are reverted to their last checkpoint, the game does not count deaths. * Platforming - Ultimately, the main levels of the game, the player must use SpongeBob and/or Patrick to proceed through the levels. Several skills such as combat, careful movement, and most notably, the use of SpongeBob/Patrick's move-sets are needed to progress. Each level has side tasks which offer a Goofy Goober Token, including; ** Sonic Wave Guitar - The player has to use SpongeBob's Sonic Guitar (his fifth and last move) to guide the wave throughout rings without missing one. ** Spongeball - The player must guide a ball-form SpongeBob through a platforming area, similar to the Super Monkey Ball series. ** Floating Block Challenge - Patrick must jump from block-to-block to reach the Goofy Goober Token before time runs out. Each block has different attributes. ** Combat Arena Challenges - SpongeBob, with only a few health units throughout the level, must defeat waves of enemies. * Driving - Using the Patty Wagon, sometimes the player will need to drive through an area. All of the driving levels have three identical side tasks: a time challenge, a ring challenge, and a \\"Macho\\" (or harder) time challenge. * Sliding - Using a small bathtub (or a shell and King Neptune's crown) which acts almost like a sled with its movement, the player must slide through the area. The side tasks are the same as in the driving sequences. * Bosses - There are a total of four boss battles in the game, none of which contain side tasks. Each completion of a challenge or its side task grants the player a Goofy Goober Token. In order to learn the moves required to advance in levels and the stories, SpongeBob and Patrick will have to complete these side missions (like the extra driving and minigame challenges) to get these tokens. SpongeBob and Patrick have a few moves, and when they get a sufficient number of points, they can upgrade a move or increase their max health. Their health units are measured in Krabby Patties; they each contain only three, but can be upgraded up to six over time. The moves will improve in effectiveness when upgraded. Throughout the game are cutscenes that are either in-game animations or FMV sequences that resemble slideshows and feature stills from the movie. =PC version= The gameplay has features that are reminiscent of point-and- click adventure games, similar to that in SpongeBob SquarePants: Employee of the Month and the PC version of SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants!. It mainly follows around SpongeBob and Patrick in a various number of locations. The game consists of 8 chapters that loosely follow the plot of the film, with additional story details being described in cutscenes between chapters that feature narration over still pictures. =GBA version= The GBA game is a 2D platformer split between 6 worlds to progress through, plus many bonus levels, and a boss at the end of each world. Unlike the console versions, there is a life system, and there is no save feature; instead, players are given a variety of level passwords as they progress through the game. Like the PC version, the story is told through still pictures, but this time with on-screen text.

Bullock * Debi Mae West * James Kevin Ward Reception According to Metacritic, the GameCube, PC, and Xbox versions of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie have received \\"Mixed or average reviews,\\" while the PS2 version received \\"Generally favorable reviews.\\" On GameRankings, the GBA version has a rating of 53 percent. =Home console versions= Juan Castro of IGN, who reviewed the home console versions, stated that \\"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie delivers an entertaining (and oftentimes challenging) mix of platform and driving sequences. Controls feel responsive and the camera rarely hinders your view of the action. And the humor of the show practically seeps out of every clamshell and bed of kelp you cross\\". The PS2 version was noted by Play magazine as \\"a full blown AAA platformer\\". GameZone's Louis Bedigian, who reviewed the Xbox version, felt that the game did not take advantage of the system's graphical capabilities, and wrote, \\"The cut scenes are more like storyboards than movie sequences. You don't get to see too many clips from the film, just stills taken from specific scenes. Why would they do this when all other movie-based games use real-time sequences, if not actual clips from the film? [‚Ä¶] This could come as a disappointment to players expecting to re-live the movie's magic through a game. During the gameplay, you'll be entertained by amusing dialogue, but the still picture movie sequences are a bore.\\" Bedigian concluded that young children would enjoy the game, except for \\"the frustration\\" of its driving levels due to its controls, which he wrote, \\"aren't very accurate, causing a lot of unnecessary screw ups during that part of the game.\\" Anise Hollingshead of GameZone praised the GameCube version for its graphics and music, but noted that \\"there probably could be more\\" sound effects for \\"a better experience.\\" Hollingshead, who felt that the game was not as fun as SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, also noted that the game's platform-based levels were not as fun as its racing levels, \\"Maybe because they're dark and dimly lit for the most part, or because they feel small and contained.\\" Hollingshead wrote that the game was probably better for older players because of \\"the slight difficulty in some of the jumping sequences, and the long races\\". =Other versions= Nintendo Power, reviewing the GBA version, noted the ability to change paths throughout the game, but wrote that \\"some areas are more difficult to reach than they should be, making the platforming tricky at times.\\" Hollingshead criticized the GBA version for its repetitive gameplay and its inclusion of Patrick as a playable character, writing that \\"despite the appearance of a dual partnership in the game, it quickly becomes evident that it's really only one playable character that's been melded from two.\\" Hollingshead wrote that \\"unlike the console versions, the story here feels tacked on and doesn't really do much to tie the levels together in any sort of cohesive manner.\\" Hollingshead praised the graphics and wrote that the music was \\"the best part of the game,\\" but concluded that the console versions \\"are much more fun.\\" Hollingshead praised the PC version for its graphics and sound, and wrote, \\"The humor from the TV show has been translated very well to this computer game, and some of the dialogue is a riot. The characters all have funny things to say, and there are plenty of sight gags, too. Playing as Plankton was a great idea, and kids will love listening to the diminutive evil-ruler wannabe as he comments on the people and things around him.\\" However, Hollingshead who felt that the game would be best for children who were between the ages of 6 and 10 wrote that \\"it's a short game, and because the adventure is the same each time through, there's not much replay value here.\\" Kristen Salvatore of Computer Gaming World felt that the PC version and its puzzles would appeal primarily to young children, but wrote that people expecting to \\"play\\" the movie would be disappointed. IGN's Levi Buchanan, who reviewed the cellphone game version, praised its graphics but criticized its simplicity. Buchanan wrote that the game \\"certainly has plenty of goofball charm and personality\\", but concluded that it was \\"something of a let-down\\" in comparison to previous SpongeBob cellphone games, as well as the \\"pretty fun console version of the game\\". The GBA version sold an estimated 780,000 copies; in August 2006, the game was ranked at number 25 on Edge magazine's list of \\"The Century's Top 50 Handheld Games,\\" arranged by number of copies sold. PlayStation 3 port On February 5, 2012, it was announced that The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie would be coming to the PlayStation Store as a PS2 Classic on February 7, 2012. The port was poorly received for numerous technical issues, including severe input lag, sound delays of up to one second during in-engine cutscenes, and stretching the 4:3 display to fill a 16:9 aspect ratio. The port was removed from the PlayStation Store shortly after release, with no official explanation given regarding its removal.

Castro is an outspoken advocate for the LGBT+ community and has publicly stated that she will fight for their rights even if it means going against her own family. Castro is widely known as one of the main drivers for the fight for acceptance of the LGBT+ community, especially in Latin American countries‚Äîmost notably, Cuba‚Äîas well as dissolving some of the antiquated stigmas and stereotypes that surround the community. She is the daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Ra√∫l Castro and feminist and revolutionary Vilma Esp√≠n, and the niece of former First Secretary Fidel Castro. Early life Mariela Castro at the 2010 Pride parade in Hamburg Mariela Castro is the daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Ra√∫l Castro and feminist and revolutionary Vilma Esp√≠n, and the niece of former First Secretary and prominent Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro. She has a brother, Alejandro Castro Esp√≠n. Castro states that as a child, she grew up in a homophobic society where members of the LGBT+ community were targeted relentlessly in terms of both law and policy and societal standards and traditional expectations. Castro stated later in life that she and her peers would ‚Äúlaugh at gays, make fun of them‚Äù. In the 1960s, members of the LGBT+ community were directly attacked and even placed in internment, or concentration camps . After speaking with some of her friends in the LGBT+ community, however, she gained a newfound awareness of the issues they face. Mariela Castro's father, Raul Castro Career Castro modeled the Cuban National Center for Sex Education after the Federation of Cuban Women, which was established by her mother in 1960. The Federation of Cuban Women, along with other organizations at the time, was created as a result of women and other members of marginalized groups expressing their readiness to be involved in social change. One of their major efforts included a proposal for a change to the government family code that defined marriage as a union between two people, regardless of gender. Castro once stated in an interview that the federation \\"spearheaded efforts to confront machismo in many arenas.\\" After the Federation was established, the public, economic, and social position of women in Cuba at the time rose dramatically - employment and equal pay opportunities for women arose, as well as maternity leave and the concept of social security for women. In 1996, along with the Cuban Ministries of Education (MINED), the Cuban National Center for Sex Education created a National Sex Education Program for Cuban schools to teach children about sex in terms of procreation and as a means of pleasure and holistic well-being, gender equality, sexual violence, and sexually transmitted infections.

He was born in Pointe-Fortune in Lower Canada in 1810 and had entered the timber trade in the Ottawa Valley by 1834. In 1837, he moved to Bytown and purchased cutting rights along the Ottawa River, Madawaska River and Indian Rivers. He built sawmills and gristmills at the Chaudi√®re Falls on the Ottawa. He also operated a general store in Bytown with his brother Hugh until 1855. In 1851, he relocated his timber business to the nearly deserted village of Arnprior, using the power of the Madawaska River to operate his mills. He also helped promote the development of the settlement there. He had bridges built, helped to bring people in, and took a leading role in promoting public improvements. Two of these involved the Madawaska River Improvement Association (later Company) and a wagon road on the Madawaska River from Arnprior to the Long Rapids. The same year, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Bytown; he did not run in 1854 but was elected in 1861 for Renfrew. In 1867, he was elected by acclamation to the 1st Canadian Parliament for Renfrew South.

The PC version of the game was released on June 16, 2006 in Europe, August 14, 2006 in North America and subsequently digitally via GOG.com on December 17, 2006 (English only), and DotEmu on May 19, 2008 (English, French, German). The Xbox 360 version was released on July 20, 2008 under the title Darkstar One: Broken Alliance by Kalypso Media, featuring 1080p and improved gameplay. Storyline The DarkStar One is an advanced, partly organic starship that was built by the protagonist's late father, Simon Jarvis, using technologies from an ancient race. Jarvis was the co-founder and co-owner of a security firm, SimRob Industries; and his business partner and friend, Robert Altair, gives Jarvis's son Kayron, the protagonist, the starship after his father's death. After Kayron becomes familiarised with the controls of the DarkStar One, Robert tells him the manner of his father's death. The weapons system on Jarvis's ship had been sabotaged by Jarvis's former co-pilot Jack Forrester. Robert identifies Forrester as a traitor and murderer. While Kayron sets out to hunt Forrester down in revenge, a series of attacks takes place on research stations across the Galactic Union (GU). The attacking ships, identified simply as drones, appear to be a type of vessel completely unknown to the GU, and Robert convinces the Galactic Council that they are of Thul origin, a genetically engineered human civilization. This antagonises all races within the Galactic Union against the Thul. In a state of heightened tension, military units are mobilised to the GU's borders in anticipation of galactic war: precisely what the Union was founded to guard against. Unfortunately, this leads to an escalation of unrest already present within GU territory: border disputes between the Arrack and Oc'to, and an increase in piracy and smuggling in the more remote and independent systems. Soon Kayron meets a pilot called Eona, who ‚Äì enigmatically ‚Äì is also looking for Forrester, but she does not divulge why. Eona's mysterious past, of legally questionable nature, means she has many contacts otherwise unavailable to Kayron, mostly linked to the criminal underworld. She becomes Kayron's co-pilot. Their adventure together leads them to Eona's sudden kidnapping and her subsequent rescue, the collecting of information from four research stations pertaining to Oc'to scientist Dr Zarkov's research into the drone attacks, and the eventual discoveries of Forrester and Dr Zarkov. There is also the revelation that it was Robert who was behind Kayron's father's death, for which he framed Forrester, and that the Thul are not responsible for the drone attacks. A highly advanced, extra- galactic race called the S'kaa is behind the attacks, and they are bent on galactic domination. Their primary means of achieving this is to control individuals in power, including Robert, and intimidate them into divulging where the weakest and most easily conquerable planet systems are. They also exploit tensions already present in the galaxy's politics, subtly manipulating races into wars that will weaken all sides. With help from allies who they meet during their travels ‚Äì including the Thul cruiser Eoghane II ‚Äì Kayron and Eona manage to find and reach the system where the S‚Äôkaa mothership is located. Together they formulate a plan of attack: using the DarkStar One‚Äôs unique plasma cannon, they create a rupture in the S‚Äôkaa ship's (otherwise impenetrable) shields, shortly after Robert ‚Äì who is held captive inside the mothership for his failure to kill Kayron earlier in the story ‚Äì double- crosses the S‚Äôkaa and sends a message to Kayron detailing the mothership's shields. With the shield penetrated, Kayron manoeuvres the DarkStar One through the ship's maze-like outer hull and into its core. After destroying the shield generator in the core, he flees from the ensuing explosion and flies back out to space. The S‚Äôkaa escape by detaching the top of their mothership from its main body and activating a portal back to their home territory. The rest of the mothership disintegrates. The DarkStar One and its allies destroy the portal beam generators that opened the portal, thereby preventing the S‚Äôkaa from returning. Victorious, they all return to the Thul cruiser on which the final battle was planned. Eona leaves the DarkStar One afterwards, but programs the ship's computer with her voice so that Kayron will \\"never be alone\\". The mission log reads \\"No more story missions available\\", but the open-ended activities of trading, escorting merchant ships, carrying out mercenary assignments and fending off pirate attacks can still be done. =Setting= The story takes place in the Milky Way, beginning in a solar system called Pencah, several light years away from the Earth. Starting in Terran (human) territory, the game takes Kayron Jarvis, the protagonist, across the known galaxy, in which he encounters five alien races ‚Äì the Mortok, Raptor, Oc'to, Arrack and the Thul ‚Äì each with their own distinct cultural identities and fighting styles. The Terrans, Mortok, Raptor, Oc‚Äôto and Arrack together form the Galactic Union (GU), a UN-like confederacy which was formed by the Terrans after a major galactic war, in order to prevent such large-scale conflicts from ever happening again. Because of drone attacks, the Thul have become isolated to their territory, while the rest of the galaxy slowly organises itself against them. The galaxy is divided into 23 sectors, or ‚Äòclusters‚Äô, which contain 331 solar systems. There are seven races in the galaxy, however only six have territories. These are Terrans, Mortok, Raptor, Oc'to, Arrack, and Thul. The S'kaa are the seventh, and their home territory is unknown, their mothership just occupying an abandoned system in Raptor territory. In Terran territory, the Galactic Union has its Council ‚Äì its headquarters ‚Äì on Earth, Sol System, Alpha Centauri cluster. Gameplay The game is divided into different action role-playing quests. These are main storyline quests, side quests, and missions which can be accepted from trade stations. The latter can further be broken down into missions which include freighter escort, transportation, bounty hunting, espionage or taking photos of objects that are of interest to your contractors. In addition, the player is also able to trade, mine, or liberate star systems from space pirates. =The DarkStar One= DarkStar One has some action role-playing elements in it, which are reflected by the ship's properties. The ship, DarkStar One, is a long-range fighter that is partly organic in its construction, and is upgraded by absorbing alien artifacts that are scattered across the galaxy, usually found inside large asteroids. The artifacts will allow the ship to be enhanced, enabling greater firepower, compatibility with a variety of alien weaponry, manoeuvrability and resistance to attack. Artifacts add to the exterior of the ship, changing its physical appearance over the course of the game, and increasing the number of weapons and equipment it can carry. The ship consists of four upgradeable parts: the hull, wings, engines and plasma cannon. Every time sufficient artifacts are recovered, the player is given the opportunity to upgrade one of the first three along with upgrading the plasma cannon as well. The plasma cannon is a unique weapon within the DarkStar One universe, and can be used to provide a number of additional attacks and abilities designed to give the player the edge in combat. These can be offensive or defensive, aiding either the ship's weapons, shields, or to attack enemy ships directly. Once all 100 artifacts have been recovered, the plasma cannon also unlocks a zero-point drive, allowing unlimited hyperspace travel throughout the galaxy. Critical reception DarkStar One received positive to mixed reviews, scoring 71/100 on Metacritic based on 33 reviews. The graphics were often praised, but the gameplay was not. GameSpot lauded its accessibility and simplicity while ActionTrip derided it as overly simplistic and repetitive. The game was frequently compared to other space sims including Elite, Freelancer, and the X series.

Passmore began performing professionally at the age of fourteen in the pantomime Cinderella. He apprenticed to a piano maker and then worked as a pianist before returning to acting, making his London debut in 1890. In 1893, Passmore joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, soon becoming the company's principal comedian. He created roles in the original productions of the last two Gilbert and Sullivan operas and in many other Savoy Operas. He also played the patter roles in several Gilbert and Sullivan revivals, and he also toured for the company. In 1903, Passmore left the company and began a career in musical comedies, plays and pantomimes in London's West End and on tour that lasted for thirty years. His West End appearances included roles in such important productions as The Earl and the Girl (1903), The Talk of the Town (1905) and Madame Pompadour (1924). He often appeared on stage with his wife, Agnes Fraser.

Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle; music by Ernest Ford). Next, in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited (1893‚Äì94), he created the role of Tarara, the public exploder. He then created the role of Bobinet in Mirette (1894). Bobinet was Passmore's first real starring part. In the autumn of 1894, Passmore named his new daughter \\"Mirette\\", perhaps in acknowledgement of his success in this break-out role. He also performed in Utopia in the role of King Paramount on tour that year. Passmore next created the role of Peter Adolphus Grigg in Sullivan and Burnand's The Chieftain (1894‚Äì1895). After this, he toured as Bobinet and Grigg. =Principal comedian of the D'Oyly Carte= as Rudolph, in The Grand Duke, taking snuff Passmore returned to the Savoy in 1895, where he continued as D'Oyly Carte's principal comedian, playing Ko-Ko in revivals of The Mikado (1895‚Äì97).

Passmore continued to play at the Savoy as the Usher in Trial by Jury, John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer (1898) and King Ouf I in The Lucky Star (1899). After seeing Passmore's performance in The Lucky Star, Sullivan noted in his diary, \\"The fun of the whole piece lies in Passmore. Take him out and nothing's left. He worked splendidly and carried the opera through. I wish though he could drop his 'cockney' accent and manners at times.\\" Passmore next played Sir Joseph in a revival of H.M.S. Pinafore (1899).

Knorr is best known as the ship that supported researchers as they discovered the wreck of the RMS Titanic in 1985. R/V Knorr (AGOR-15) has traveled more than a million miles‚Äîthe rough equivalent of two round trips to the Moon or forty trips around the Earth. Her sister ship is the RV Melville. History R/V Knorr was named in honor of Ernest R. Knorr, a distinguished hydrographic engineer and cartographer who was appointed Chief Engineer Cartographer of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic office in 1860. Chief Engineer Knorr was one of the leaders of the Navy‚Äôs first systematic charting and surveying effort from 1860 to 1885. She was launched in August 21, 1968 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan, Knorr was delivered to Woods Hole on April 15, 1970. The ship was built with Cycloidal propulsion that was replaced during a 1989-1991 midlife refit at which time propulsion was changed to two azimuthing stern thrusters and a retractable bow thruster as well as the hull being lengthened from to . In 2003 a Dynamic Positioning System capable of holding the ship in position within one meter was installed providing capability for ocean drilling and other precise operations. During a 2005-2006 refit a long coring system capable of , longest in the U.S. research fleet, deep cores was installed. In 1985, she was part of the joint French-American Team that discovered the wreck of the RMS Titanic, and was the ship to actually discover the site. As opposed to the traditional method of sonar, this was accomplished by towing the ROV Argo over the seafloor to search for debris. She was completely overhauled between 1989 and 1991 adding of length to her midsection. The ship has anti-roll tanks and an ice-strengthened bow enabling her to work in all of the world‚Äôs oceans. She can take a crew of 22 and a scientific party of 34 to sea for as long as 60 days. Knorr was designed to accommodate a wide range of oceanographic tasks, with two instrument hangars and eight scientific work areas; a fully equipped machine shop; three oceanographic winches; and two cranes. Knorr is equipped with sophisticated navigation and satellite communication systems, as well as a dynamic positioning system that allows the ship to move in any direction and to maintain a fixed position in high winds and rough seas. In 2005‚Äì2006, the ship was refitted to support a new ‚Äúlong-coring‚Äù system that can extract plugs of ancient sediments from the sea floor. Weighing nearly 25,000 pounds, the new piston-coring system is the longest in the U.S. research fleet (twice as long as existing systems). Knorr and its long-corer will allow scientists to sample deep, ancient sediments that are rich with historical information about the ocean and climate. It was announced on December 4, 2014, that the research vessel Knorr is being decommissioned after more than 40 years as the workhorse of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution research fleet. It was transferred to the Mexican Navy in 2016, and is scheduled to be replaced by a new $74 million research vessel, the RV Neil Armstrong.

It is an open hand coloured red, with the fingers pointing upwards, the thumb held parallel to the fingers, and the palm facing forward. It is usually shown as a right hand, but is sometimes a left hand, such as in the coats of arms of baronets. Historical background Original Red Hand Seal of √ì N√©ill The Red Hand is rooted in Gaelic culture and, although its origin and meaning is unknown, it is believed to date back to pagan times. The Red Hand is first documented in surviving records in the 13th-century, where it was used by the Hiberno-Norman de Burgh earls of Ulster. It was Walter de Burgh who became first Earl of Ulster in 1243 who combined the de Burgh cross with the Red Hand to create a flag that represented the Earldom of Ulster and later became the modern Flag of Ulster. It was afterwards adopted by the O'Neills (U√≠ N√©ill) when they assumed the ancient kingship of Ulster (Ulaid), inventing the title Rex Ultonie (king of Ulster) for themselves in 1317 and then claiming it unopposed from 1345 onwards. An early Irish heraldic use in Ireland of the open right hand can be seen in the seal of Aodh Reamhar √ì N√©ill, king of the Irish of Ulster, 1344‚Äì1364.National Library of Ireland Heraldry In Ireland An early 15th- century poem by Mael √ì h√öig√≠nn is named L√°mh dhearg √âireann √≠ Eachach, the first line of which is a variation of the title: \\"Lamh dhearg √âiriond Ibh Eathoch\\", translated as \\"The √ö√≠ Eachach are the 'red hand' of Ireland\\". The U√≠ Eachach were one of the Cruthin tribes (known as the D√°l nAraidi after 773) that made up the ancient kingdom of Ulaid. The Red Hand symbol is believed to have been used by the O'Neills during its Nine Years' War (1594‚Äì1603) against English rule in Ireland, and the war cry l√°mh dearg √âireann ab√∫! (\\"the Red Hand of Ireland to victory\\") was also associated with them. An English writer of the time noted \\"The Ancient Red Hand of Ulster, the bloody Red Hand, a terrible cognizance! And in allusion to that terrible cognizance- the battle cry of Lamh dearg abu!\\" The Order of Baronets was instituted by letters patent dated 10 May 1612, which state that \\"the Baronets and their descendants shall and may bear, either in a canton in their coat of arms, or in an inescutcheon, at their election, the arms of Ulster, that is, in a field argent, a hand gules, or a bloody hand.\\" The oldest baronets used a dexter (right) hand just like the O'Neills, however it later became a sinister (left) hand. =Dispute over ownership= The exclusive rights to the use of the Red Hand symbol has proved a matter of debate over the centuries, primarily whether it belonged to the O'Neills (U√≠ N√©ill) or the Magennises (M√©ig Aonghasa). The O'Neills became the chief dynasty of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill and later the kings of Ulster, whilst the Magennises were the ruling dynasty of the U√≠ Eachach Cobo, the chief dynasty of the Cruthin of Ulaid, and also head of the Clanna Rudraige. A 16th-century poem noted disagreement between the \\"S√≠ol R√∫ra√≠\\" (an alias for Clanna Rudraige) and the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. A dispute, dated to 1689, arose between several Irish poets about whose claim to the Red Hand was the most legitimate. *Diarmaid Mac an Bhaird, one of the last fully trained Irish bardic poets, admonishes the claim of the O'Neills to the Red Hand, arguing that it rightly belongs to the Magennises, who should be allowed to keep it. He supports his statement citing several medieval texts attributing it to Conall Cernach, the legendary ancestor of the U√≠ Eachach Cobo. *Eoghan √ì Donnghaile refutes the Clanna R√≥igh (Clanna Rudraige) right to the symbol. He cites a story based on the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn claiming that it belongs to the descendants of √ârim√≥n, from whom Conn of the Hundred Battles and thus the O'Neills are said to descend. *Niall Mac Muireadhaigh dismisses both these claims and states that the symbol belongs to the Clann Domhnaill (descended from the Three Collas, the legendary ancestors of the Airg√≠alla). Mac Muireadhaigh derides √ì Donnghaile as a fool and finds it deplorable that he is an author. Further poetic quatrains in the dispute were written by Mac an Baird, √ì Donnghaile, as well as by Mac an Bhaird's son Eoghain. The Mac an Bhairds appear to deride √ì Donnghaile as not having come from a hereditary bardic family and that he is of very low rank without honour, as well as hinting at his family's genealogical link to the O'Neills. Writing in 1908, the then head of the O'Neill clan says of the Red Hand: \\"History teaches us that already in pagan days it was adopted by the O'Neills from the Macgennis, who were princes in the north of Ireland region inhabited by them\\". =Possible origins= Those involved in the bardic dispute of 1689 claimed that the Red Hand symbol came from a legendary ancestor who put his bloodstained hand on a banner after victory in battle: *Diarmaid Mac an Bhaird claimed that Conall Cernach (a mythical Ulaid hero from the Ulster Cycle) put his bloodied hand on a banner as he avenged the death of C√∫ Chulainn (another mythical Ulaid hero), and it has belonged to the descendants of Conall since then. This he says is backed up by medieval texts such as the Sc√©la Mucce Meie Da Th√≥ (\\"The Tale of Mac Da Th√≥'s Pig\\"), the Leabhar Ultach (also known as the Senchas Ulad and Senchas S√≠l √çr), and √ì h√öig√≠nn's poem beginning L√°mh √âireann √≠ Eachach. *Eoghan √ì Donnghaile, basing his tale on the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, claimed that after the Milesians defeated the Tuatha D√© Danann, they are granted three precious objects, amongst them a banner bearing the red hand. This banner eventually ended up without contest in the hands of the descendants of M√≠l's son √ârim√≥n, from whom Conn of the Hundred Battles and thus the O'Neills are said to descend. The surviving texts of the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn mention four treasures but not a banner. *Niall Mac Muireadhaigh claimed that when the Three Collas defeated the Ulaid, that one of the Collas placed their bloodied hand on a banner taken from them. He then states the Clann Domhnaill have used the symbol within his own time, and accepts the poem L√°mh √âireann √≠ Eachach. However according to historian Gordon √ì Riain, Mac Muireadhaigh has mistaken the √≠ Eachach element to mean the descendants of Echu Doiml√©n, father of the Collas, when in fact it is in reference to Echu Coba, legendary ancestor of the Magennises. Historian Francis J. Bigger notes the use of a right hand by the O'Neills around 1335, and surmises that it may have been for them a symbol signifying divine assistance and strength, whilst also suggesting that the ancient Phoenicians may have brought the symbol to Ireland. In medieval Irish literature, several real and legendary kings were given the byname 'red hand' or 'red handed' to signify that they were great warriors.√ì h√ìg√°in, D√°ith√≠. Myth, Legend & Romance: An encyclopaedia of the Irish folk tradition. Prentice Hall Press, 1991. pp.36-37 One is the mythical High King of Ireland, Lugaid L√°mderg (Lugaid the red handed), who according to Eugene O'Curry is cited in one Irish legend as being king of the Cruthin of Ulaid during the reign of the mythical Conchobar Mac Nessa. The O'Neills believed in the Middle Ages that a messianic 'red handed' king called Aodh Eangach would come to lead them and drive the English out of Ireland. In a 1901 edition of the All Ireland Review, a writer called \\"M.M.\\" suggests that the Red Hand is named after the founder of the Clanna Rudraige, Rudraige mac Sithrigi, and that Rudraige's name may mean \\"red wrist\\". In another edition a \\"Y.M.\\" suggests likewise, arguing that Rudraige's name means \\"red arm\\". They also suggest that the Cr√≥eb Ruad (Red Branch) of ancient Ulaid may actually come from crob and ruadh (red hand). In another legend which has become widespread, the first man to lay his hand on the province of Ulster would have claim to it. As a result the warriors rushed towards land with one chopping off his hand and throwing it over his comrades and thus winning the land. In some versions of the tale, the person who cuts off his hand belongs to the O'Neills, or is Niall of the Nine Hostages himself. In other versions, the person is the mythical √ârim√≥n.The Red Hand of Ulster ='Red Hand' as a byname= In medieval Irish literature, several real and legendary kings were given the byname 'red hand' or 'red handed' (l√°mhdhearg or crobhdhearg). It signified that they were a great warrior, their hand being red with the blood of their enemies. *The ancient Irish god Nuada Airgetl√°m (Nuada the silver handed) was also known by the alias Nuada Derg Lamh, the red-handed, amongst other aliases. Nuada is stated in the Book of Lecan as being the ancestor of the Eoganachta and D√°l gCais of Munster. *Lugaid L√°mderg is a legendary figure who appears in the Book of Leinster and the \\"chaotic past\\" of the descent of the D√°l gCais. His epithet meaning \\"red hand\\", was transferred to Lugaid Meann around the start of the Irish historic period. *Labraid L√°mderg (red hand Labraid) is a character in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. *The Annals of the Four Masters mentions \\"Reachta Righdhearg\\" (Rechtaid R√≠gderg) as a High King of Ireland. He gained the name \\"Righdhearg\\" according to Geoffrey Keating as he had an arm that was \\"exceeding Red\\". Reachta is listed as the great- grandson of \\"Lughaigdh Lamdhearg\\" (Lugaid L√°mderg). *Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair, otherwise known as \\"Cathal the Red-Handed O'Conor\\", was a king of Connacht in the early 13th-century. There is a poem that is attributed as having been composed between 1213 and Cathal's death in 1224, which makes frequent reference to Cathal's red hand. *A Dermott Lamhdearg is cited by Meredith Hanmer in his \\"Chronicles of Ireland\\" (first published in 1633), as being a king of Leinster who fought a battle around the start of the 5th century against an army of marauders at Knocknigen near Dublin. *The Kavanagh's of Borris, County Carlow, descend from Dermot Kavanagh Lamhdearg, lord of St Mullin's, the second son of Gerald Kavanagh, Lord of Ferns in 1431. Gerald was descended from Domhnall Caomh√°nach, a son of Diarmait Mac Murchada, king of Leinster. *The Cavenagh's of Kildare that became part of the Protestant Ascendancy are kin of the Kavanagh's of Borris and according to their own traditions claim descent from a Cathair Rua Caomh√°nach who was said to descend the L√°mhdhearg (Red Hand) branch of the Caomh√°nach clan. *Quatran 78 of the classical Irish poem Carn Fraoich Soitheach na Saorchlann, makes mention of the \\"inghean r√≠ogh l√°mhdhearg Laighean\\", translated as \\"a descendant (lit. daughter) of the red-handed kings of Leinster\\". This poem, as well as the related poem Osnach Carad i gCluain Fraoch, mention a Carn L√°mha, the burial place of Fraoch's hand. *Gleoir Lamhderg, or Gleoir the red-handed, was a king of the Lamraighe and allegedly the step-father Fionn mac Cumhaill from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. The Lamraighe are claimed as descending from Lamha, a son of Conchobar mac Nessa, a legendary king of Ulster. Similar symbols The Dextera Dei, or \\"Right Hand of God\\", is a symbol that appears on only three high crosses in Ireland: the Cross of Muiredach at Monasterboice; the Cross of King Flann (also known as the Cross of the Scriptures) at Clonmacnoise; and the Cross in the Street of Kells. The former two have the full hand with fingers extended similar to the Red Hand. The form and position of the Kells Dextera Dei is of a pattern usually found on the Continent, whereas that used at Monasterboice and Clonmacnoise appears to unique within Christendom. The Dextera Dei is suggested by Francis J. Bigger as representing the old-world figurative expression of signifying strength and power, and such hand symbols can be found in ancient civilisations including amongst others the Assyrians, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Chaldeans and Phoenicians. It is also used by Jews, Muslims, and can be found in use in Palestine and Morocco. Aboriginal Australians revered the hands of their deceased chieftains. Another historian, F. J. Elworthy, according to Bigger, conclusively proved the ancient character and widespread usage of the symbol amongst early pagan civilisations. According to Charles Vallancey in 1788, a red hand pointing upwards was the armorial symbol of the kings of Ireland, and that it was still in use by the O'Brien family, whose motto was Lamh laidir an uachdar, meaning \\"the strong hand up\\" or \\"the strong hand will prevail\\". Hands feature prominently in Dermot O'Connor's 18th-century publication \\"Blazons and Irish Heraldic Terminology\\", with the √ì Fearghail sept bearing the motto L√°mh dhearg air chlogad l√∫ptha. Modern usage Coat of Arms of Monaghan The form in common use is an open right (dexter) hand coloured red, with the fingers pointing upwards, the thumb held parallel to the fingers, and the palm facing forward. Coats of arms used by those whose surnames are of U√≠ N√©ill descent ‚Äì √ì Donnghaile, √ì Cath√°in, Mac Aodha, √ì D√°laigh, √ì Ma√©ilsheachlainn and √ì Ceatharnaigh, to name just a few ‚Äì all feature the Red Hand in some form. On the √ì N√©ill and Donnelly coat of arms featuring the Red Hand, the motto is L√°mh Dhearg √âireann (Red Hand of Ireland). The arms of the chiefs of the Scottish Clan MacNeil (of Barra) contain the Red Hand; the clan has traditionally claimed descent from Niall of the Nine Hostages. Many other families have used the Red Hand to highlight an Ulster ancestry. The head of the Guinness family, the Earl of Iveagh, has three Red Hands on his arms granted as recently as 1891.Burke's Peerage, London 2003, sub \\"Iveagh\\" The Red Hand is present on a number of Ulster counties crests such as Antrim, Cavan, Londonderry, Monaghan and Tyrone. It was later included in the now abolished Government of Northern Ireland flag. It is also used by many other official and non-official organisations throughout the province of Ulster and the rest of Ireland. The arms of The Irish Society that carried out the Plantation of Ulster feature the Red Hand. The Red Hand can be regarded as one of the very few cross-community symbols used in Northern Ireland (which makes up six of Ulster's nine counties) crossing the sectarian political divide. Due to its roots as a Gaelic Irish symbol, nationalist/republican groups have used (and continue to use) it ‚Äì for example the republican Irish Citizen Army, the republican National Graves Association, Belfast, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, the Ulster GAA association GAA clubs in Ulster. Other organisations within the nine counties of Ulster and also supported within the political sectarian divide, use it happily in the six Ulster counties within Northern Ireland, such as the Ulster Hockey Union, these are supported from both sides of the community- nationalist and unionist. As the most identifiable symbol of Ulster, at the start of the 20th century it has also been used by Northern Ireland's unionists and loyalists, such as its use in the Ulster Covenant (1912) and in the arms of the Government of Northern Ireland (from 1922 and now abolished), the Ulster Banner (the former flag of the Northern Ireland government), the Ulster Volunteers and loyalist paramilitary groups based only within Northern Ireland such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association among others. =Baronets= The arms of the Viscount Brookeborough indicate the viscount is also a baronet: Or, a cross engrailed per pale gules and sable, a crescent for difference. A left (sinister) Red Hand is an option for baronets to add to their arms to indicate their rank. The College of Arms formally allowed this in 1835, ruling that the baronets of England, Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom may \\"bear either a canton in their coat of arms, or in an escutcheon, at their pleasure, the arms of Ulster (to wit) a Hand Gules or a Bloody Hand in a Field Argent.\\" It is blazoned as follows: A hand sinister couped at the wrist extended in pale gules.Collins, Arthur, The English Baronetage: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of all the English Baronets now Existing, Volume 4, London, 1741, p.287 King James I of England established the hereditary Order of Baronets in England on 22 May 1611, in the words of Collins (1741): \\"for the plantation and protection of the whole Kingdom of Ireland, but more especially for the defence and security of the Province of Ulster, and therefore for their distinction those of this order and their descendants may bear (the Red Hand of Ulster) in their coats of arms either in a canton or an escutcheon at their election\\". Such baronets may also display the Red Hand of Ulster on its own as a badge, suspended by a ribbon below the shield of arms.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1235 Baronets of Nova Scotia, unlike other baronets, do not use the Red Hand of Ulster, but have their own badge showing the Royal Arms of Scotland on a shield over the Saltire of St Andrew. The left-hand version has also been used by the Irish National Foresters, the Irish Citizen Army and the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland. =Examples= Image:Flag of Ulster.svgThe flag of the province of Ulster Image:Four Provinces Flag.svgFour Provinces Flag of Ireland Image:Ulster banner.svgThe flag of the Northern Ireland parliament (1953‚Äì1972) Image:BaronetUK-cropped.jpgBadge worn by baronets of the United Kingdom Image:Curti-Siegel 1699 Anna Helena v.

Publication history Zarjaz was started in 2001 by Andrew J. Lewis and ran for four issues. The fanzine contained comic strips based on various 2000 AD characters and also ran an in-depth interview with writer Alan Moore. There were contributions from established 2000 AD creators like Alan Grant and gave a start to others such as Adrian Bamforth and Simon Spurrier. It was originally printed in A4 format and reproduced cheaply giving it something of the feel of the original 2000 AD comic as it appeared in the 70s and early 80s. Issues 3 and 4 were printed in the smaller A5 size in an attempt to keep costs low and were published simultaneously. Zarjaz was re- launched in 2005 by Colin J. Dinnie under the Underfire Comics banner, with whom he had previously edited the small press anthology Rapid Fire. The new run has so far produced seven issues but because the first was an \\"Issue 0\\" it is numerically only up to six. The new series features colour covers as opposed to the black and white of the original run. Zarjaz is now being produced and published by FutureQuake Publishing, who took over with issue #5 (May 2008), as they had done with the Dogbreath, the Strontium Dog fanzine at issue #15 (December 2006). Contributors Contributors have come both from mainstream comics and the small press and include Alan Grant, PJ Holden, Al Ewing and Arthur Wyatt and has helped showcase for some of the newest generation of 2000 AD writers and artists like Simon Spurrier, Adrian Bamforth and Nick Dyer.

Known only from Classical Greek and Roman sources, they were one of the peoples held to be responsible for the downfall of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. In Greek Mythology they were the children of Iapetus and Asia. Modern scholars have attempted to identify the Asii with other peoples known from European and Chinese sources including the: Yuezhi, Tocharians, Issedones/Wusun and/or Alans. Historical sources The classical European sources relating to the Asii are brief. They sometimes survive only as quotations in other ancient sources, with textual variations that have led to widely varying translations and interpretations. During the 4th and 3rd Centuries BCE, Megasthenes, who lived in Arachosia and was an ambassador to the Mauryan court in Pataliputra, refers in his work Indika to three tribes with similar and possibly related names, in separate parts of South Asia: * the Aseni had three cities and their capital was the Bucephala (where Alexander the Great had buried his horse by the same name), the site of which is a matter of controversy;Archaeological Reconnaissances in North-western India and South-eastern ƒ™rƒÅn, pp. 31‚Äì32 and n. 15. Aurel Stein. (1937). Macmillan and Co., London. * the Osii were near neighbours of the Taxillae in the Indus Valley, and; * the Asoi lived on plains known as Amanda (probably Gandhara), alongside tribes such as the Peucolaitae (Pushkalavati) and Geretae (Panjkorans). These references by Megasthenes have survived only as citations in other texts. In the 1st century BCE, Trogus names ‚Äì in the Historiae Philppicae (of which only the \\"Prologues\\" have survived intact) ‚Äì three tribes involved in the conquest of Bactria: the Asiani, Sacaraucae and Tochari (i.e. the Tukhara of Bactria rather than the so-called Tocharians of the Tarim Basin). The Tochari are reported to have, at some point, become subject to the ruling elite of the Asiani. According to Trogus, the Sacaraucae had since been destroyed. (In about 200 CE, the Roman historian, Justin (Marcus Junianus Justinus), wrote an epitome or condensation of Trogus's history. The last datable event recorded by Justin is the recovery of the Roman standards captured by the Parthians in 20 BCE, although Trogus' original history may have dealt with events into the first decade of the 1st century CE.) Strabo completed his Geography in 23 CE. He mentions four tribes: the Asioi, Pasianoi, Sakaraulai, and Tokharoi. Pliny the Elder, in about 77‚Äì79 CE, makes a brief mention of a people called the Asini in his Naturalis Historia. According to P. H. L. Eggermont: > Pliny mentions ... the Asini, who are reigning in the city of Bucephela. > From these three data, 1) the Tacoraei are neighbours of the > Besadae/Sosaeadae; 2) the Asini are the neighbours of the Sosaeadae > [possibly the Kirata]; [and] 3) The Asiani are kings of the Thocari, it > follows that the Asini of Pliny's text are identical with the Asiani, who > are the kings of the Tocharians. This implies that‚Äîat least in the time of > Pliny‚Äîthe KushƒÅ·πáas were kings of the region between Jhelam and Indus and > that Bucephala was one of their cities.

Eggermont. Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 9 > (1966), p. 283. Possible links to other peoples Many theories have been proposed by historians and other scholars as to their origins, relationships, language, culture, etc., but so far no consensus has emerged. It is generally accepted that the Asiani mentioned by Trogus were probably identical to the Asii of Strabo.Iaroslav Lebedynsky. (2006). Les Saces: Les ¬´Scythes¬ª d'Asie, VIIIe si√®cle av. J.-C. ‚Äî IVe si√®cle apr. J.-C. Editions Errance, Paris. There is no agreement over whether another tribe mentioned by Strabo, the \\"Pasiani\\" were likewise related. Scholars such as W. W. Tarn, Moti Chandra believe that \\"as Asiani is the (Iranian) adjectival form of Asii, so Pasiani would be the similar adjectival form of, and would imply, a name such as *Pasii or *Pasi\\".Seleucid-Parthian Studies, 1930, p 11; The Greeks in Bactria & India, 1938, p 292, William Woodthorpe TarnTrade and Trade Routes in Ancient India, 1977, p 94, Moti Chandra; Geographical and Economic Studies in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata: UpƒÅyana Parva, 1945, p 17, Moti Chandra.Proceedings of the British Academy, 1930, p 113, British Academy, Balasundara Gupta; Literary History of Ancient India in Relation to Its Racial and Linguistic Affiliations, 1953, p 148, Chandra Chakraberty ‚Äì Sanskrit literature. This may suggest that Strabo was referring to a group of Persians (Old Persian PƒÅrsa) or Parsis who had settled in Central Asia. However, scholars such as J. Marquart believe that they were synonymous with the Asiani.Goeg., XI, 8, 2, Von Gutschmid. In other words, the Asii and the Pasiani were one and the same, and \\"Pasiani\\" was a misspelling of Asiani, or a variant of the same name. Others suggest that the name is a misspelling of Gasiani,\\"The Y√ºeh-chih and their migrations.\\" K. Enoki, G. A. Koshelenko and Z. Haidary. In: History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume II.

Alfred von Gutschmid believed that Asii, Pasiani and other names mentioned by Strabo are an attempt to render Yuezhi in Greek.Goeg., XI, 8, 2, Alfred von Gutschmid. W. W. Tarn first thought that the Asii were probably one part of the Yuezhi, the other being the Tocharians. However, he later expressed doubts as to this position.W. W. Tarn. The Greeks in Bactria and India. 2nd edition. (1951), pp. 284, 286, 533. Cambridge.Taishan Yu. A Study of Saka History, p. 40, n. 30. (1998) Sino-Platonic Papers. University of Pennsylvania. By the middle of the 1st Millennium CE, speakers of the so-called Tocharian A language in the Tarim Basin, apparently referred to themselves as ƒÄr≈õi (pronounced \\"arshi\\"; apparently meaning \\"shining\\" or \\"brilliant\\"). =Issedones/Wusun= Asii or Asiani may simply be a corruption of the name of the Issedones ‚Äì an Iranian people mentioned by Herodotus ‚Äì who are frequently identified with the Wusun mentioned in contemporaneous Chinese sources. Taishan Yu proposes that Asii were \\"probably\\" the dominant tribe of a confederacy of four Issedonean tribes \\"from the time that they had settled in the valleys of the Ili and Chu\\" who later invaded Sogdiana and Bactria. \\"This would account for their being called collectively \\"Issedones\\" by Herodotus.\\" He also states that the \\"Issedon Scythia and the Issedon Serica took their names from the Issedones.\\"Taishan Yu.

There is circumstantial evidence for such a link in: * the name of the Aorsi, who migrated from Central Asia during the late 5th century BCE, to areas north and west of the Caspian Sea, and;Richard Brzezinski & M. Mielczarek, 2002, The Sarmatians, 600 BC - AD 450, Oxford, Osprey Military, pp. 7‚Äì8, 92. * a state known to 2nd and 1st century BCE Chinese scholars as Yancai and Alanliao,Y. A.

Onomastic evidence for the identification of the Asii and Alans is provided by later medieval European scholars and travellers. In the 13th century, Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (Johannes de Plano Carpini) referred to Alani sive Assi (\\"Alans or Assi\\") and William of Rubrouck used the name Alani sive Aas (\\"Alans or Aas\\"). In the 15th century, Josephus Barbarus reported that the Alans referred to themselves by the name As.F. Thordarson, 1987‚Äì2011, \\"Asii\\", Encyclopedia Iranica (12 March 2017) The name of the Ossetians, who are descended from the Alans, also has its root in the alternate ethnonym Osi. However, names similar to Alan (e.g. Aryan and Iron) were clearly used by distantly-related Iranian tribes in very different historical contexts and the identification of the Alans with the Asii requires them to have migrated more than 2,800 kilometres (1,750 miles) in the space of several decades. According to archaeologist Claude Rapin, it is unlikely that the Asii of Bactria migrated further west than Kangju/Sogdia.Rapin, Claude (2007). \\"Nomads and the Shaping of Central Asia.\\" In: After Alexander: Central Asia before Islam.

It was released December 26, 2006, by Tor Books. Plot summary Dhracian hunter Rath arrives by sea, searching for the F'dor demons and also for Ysk, now known as Achmed the Snake, the Assassin King of Ylorc. At the same time dragons gather in a primeval forest glade to mourn the death of the dragon Llauron, who died protecting his daughter-in-law Rhapsody and her newborn son, Meridion, which happened at the end of the previous book of the series, Elegy for a Lost Star. His death also means the loss of the lore and control over the Earth itself that it represents. The dragons are terrified for what will come as a result of this loss. In Navarne, Lord and Lady Cymrian hold a secret meeting attended by King Achmed, his sergeant Grunthor, Lord Marshal Anborn, young Duke Gwydion Navarne and Constantin, the Patriarch of Sepulvarta. It becomes clear that Talquist, the new ruler of Sorbold, is making preparations for a war against his neighbours. Ashe sends his wife and baby Meridion to safety to Ylorc with Achmed and Grunthor and calls a meeting of Cymrian nobles. Meanwhile Anborn and Constantin travel with an army to the Holy City of Sepulvarta, which has been attacked by sorboldian troops. Achmed meets Rath, who tells him of his destiny to hunt the F'dor demons, yet declines Rath's request to join him - as a Firbolg King and protector of the Earth Child he has other priorities.

He is credited with describing more than 100 new species of American reptiles and amphibians. In addition, he has been honored by having at least six species named after him, including the southwestern blackhead snake (Tantilla hobartsmithi), Smith's earth snake (Uropeltis grandis), Smith's arboreal alligator lizard (Abronia smithi), Hobart's anadia (Anadia hobarti), Hobart Smith's anole (Anolis hobartsmithi), and Smith's rose-bellied lizard (Sceloporus smithi).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Hobart\\", p. 124; \\"Smith, H.M.\\", p. 247). At 100 years of age, Smith continued to be an active and productive herpetologist. Having published more than 1,600 manuscripts, he surpassed all contemporaries and remains the most published herpetologist of all time. Early life and education Smith was born in Stanwood, Iowa on September 26, 1912. Smith attained his bachelor of science in 1932 from Kansas State University, under Howard K. Gloyd, and attained his masters (in 1933) and doctorate (in 1936) at the University of Kansas under Dr. Edward Harrison Taylor, where his thesis was a revision of the lizard genus Sceloporus. He also participated in several specimen collecting trips to Mexico. Career In 1936 Smith was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship at the University of Michigan, where he worked with several other researchers to write and publish The Mexican and Central American Lizards of the Genus Sceloporus. In 1937 he worked for both the Chicago Academy of Sciences and the Field Museum of Natural History. He was given a fellowship by the Smithsonian Institution to collect specimens in Mexico, and collected over 20,000. From 1941 until 1945 he was a zoology professor at the University of Rochester, in New York. In 1945 he returned to the University of Kansas as an associate professor and wrote the Handbook of Lizards, Lizards of the US and of Canada. In 1946 he moved to Texas and became an associate professor of wildlife management at Texas A&M; University and wrote Checklist and key to snakes of Mexico and Checklist and key to amphibians of Mexico with Taylor. From 1947 until 1968 he was a professor of zoology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He retired in 1968 and moved to Boulder, Colorado, where he became a professor of biology at the University of Colorado. In 1972 he became chairman of, what is now, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In 1983 he retired, becoming a professor emeritus and continued his personal research with over 1,600 publications, including 29 books. Personal life Born Frederick William Stouffer in 1912, he was adopted in 1916 by Charles and Frances Smith, farmers. In 1938 he married Rozella Pearl Beverly Blood (who became Rozella Pearl Beverly Blood Smith, 1911‚Äì1987), who helped him publish his extensive collection of herpetological notes. In 1942 he named a species of lizard in honor of her, Celestus rozellae.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Rozella\\", p. 228). A subspecies of snake, Tantillita lintoni rozellae, is also named in honor of her.

In 1830, the Academy awarded him a gold medal and named him an \\"Artist\\" in 1832. In 1836, he became a member of the Academy and began working with Karl Briullov. Three years later, he was named an \\"Academician\\" and was awarded a stipend to study in Rome. After falling in love with one of his Italian models, he took her with him to Saint Petersburg in 1842. Two years later, she ran away with all of his money, which caused an emotional breakdown that left him mentally disturbed and subject to hypochondria. For long periods, he was unable to work and fell into poverty. Although he was eventually awarded a small pension by the Academy, he found it necessary to go live with his brother in Kashin and died there shortly after, apparently from tuberculosis.

A villain‚ÄîSir Fenwick, False Fennick, or fause Phenix‚Äîsteals the king's jewels. He lays the blame on James Hatley or Jamie O‚ÄôLee. In one variant, the king's daughter steals the keys to ask him whether he did it. Accepting his word, she arranges for a trial by combat. James kills Fenwick, who confesses while dying. The king's daughter offers to marry him. In another, he is the page to the king's son. He appeals to the prince, who fights for him. False Fennick confesses, and the prince resolves to give his lands to James. In a third, the king's son escorts him to the trial by combat, because he does not trust fause Phenix. James fights and kills him. He confesses before he dies. The royal family promise him appointments and lands; James declares he would rather be the prince's page.

The family, both a branch of counts and a baronial branch, continues in Finland and Sweden.Creutz (Nordisk familjebok); Creutz (Suomen Ritarihuone) History The Creutz family is attested in source from the late 15th century. They had their seat at the manor of Malmg√•rd in Pern√•, eastern Uusimaa, Finland. Naval commander M√•rten Mattsson, lord of Sarvlaks, received a confirmation of privileges of nobility from King John III of Sweden on 2 August 1569. When the Swedish House of Nobility was established 1625-26, the family was registered under number 92 of untitled nobility and with the name Creutz. The name imitated the Germanic trend of having actual surnames; in this case denoting a cross. Lorentz Creutz the elder, governor of the √Öbo and Borg√• county, later member of the Privy Council of Sweden, admiral of the Swedish navy, lawspeaker of Northern Finland, was created friherre Creutz (baron) in 1654 by Queen Christina of Sweden on the day of her abdication. His family was registered under number 48 among baronial class. His wife was baroness Elsa Duwall, heiress of Abborfors. Baron Johan Creutz, the Marshal of the nobility (lantmarskalk), member of the Privy Council, president of the Court of Appeals of √Öbo, was created count Creutz on 31 December 1719 by queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden and in 1720 his family was registered under number 68 among the comital class. His cousin, Baron Ernst Johan Creutz, was created Count but he did not register it into the Swedish House of Knights and Nobility, and upon his childless death, that comital creation became extinct. When Finland in 1809 became an autonomous Grand Duchy, those members of the Creutz family who resided in Finland and swore fealty to the Grand Duke Emperor Alexander I, were confirmed in their noble privileges and titles as to the grand ducal estates of Finland. Accordingly, when the Finnish House of Nobility was established 1818, the comital family of Creutz was registered there under number 1 among the comital class.

Designed by Sir Robert Rawlinson, it was opened on 12 April 1862 and remains open to this day. The pier originally was a simple promenade deck 960 ft (291m) long and 15 ft (4.6m) wide. In 1888 the pier was upgraded with the width increased to 30 ft (9.2m) and the pier head increased to 105 ft (32m) for a 650-seat pavilion to be built. It is a Grade II listed building structure. The pier has been named Pier of the Year by the National Piers Society on two occasions, first in 2006 and again in 2019.Art Deco Worthing Pier Dubbed Best in Britain: BBC report:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-47878538 Worthing Pier, an Art Deco masterpiece, 2018 History By 1894 a steam ship began operation between Worthing Pier and the Chain Pier in Brighton, twelve miles to the east. Over the Easter weekend that year 4 year old Archie Miles, separated from his promenading family, managed to unwittingly stow away on board setting off a police hunt and was only reunited with his frantic parents after a night in the workhouse at Brighton and a telegram to his grandparents in Mayfield. The first moving picture show in Worthing was seen on the pier on 31 August 1896 and is commemorated today by a blue plaque. In March 1913, on Easter Monday, the pier was damaged in a storm, with only the southern end remaining, completely cut off from land. Later, it was affectionately named 'Easter Island'. A rebuilt pier was opened on 29 May 1914. In September 1933 the pier and all but the northern pavilion were destroyed by fire. In 1935 the remodelled Streamline Moderne pier was opened, and it is this that remains today. Worthing Pier was sectioned in 1940 for fear of German invasion after the British retreat at Dunkirk. Army engineers used explosive to blow a 120ft. hole by in the pier to prevent it from being used as a possible landing stage in the event of an invasion. The pier is owned by Worthing Borough Council (formerly Worthing Corporation). The Pavilion Theatre and Denton Cafe is situated at the northern, land end of the pier; at the middle is the 1935 amusement arcade, which from 1956 - 2006 carried a distinctive 'New Amusements' sign that was featured on the cover of the album To See the Lights (1996) by Britpop band Gene. Since 2006 the sign has changed from 'New Amusements' to 'Pier Amusements'. The Southern Pavilion (the sea end) is currently home to tearoom and function area, having undergone extensive renovation between September 2013 and the re-opening in April 2014, having previously been used as a nightclub named The Pier, which opened on 20 December 2007, and prior to that a cafe, dance hall and to house a model railway layout. It can be hired for weddings and is used as a live music venue. Since 2008, Worthing Pier has been the home of the annual International Birdman competition, which moved to Worthing after it could no longer safely be held on the Bognor Regis Pier at Bognor Regis, some to the west. However, Birdman competitions were held in both towns from 2010. On 24 February 2016, it was announced that the Birdman will be cancelled for that year and that the Worthing Town Centre Initiative (WTCI) were unsure whether it would return in 2017. In November 2009 during strong winds, two Worthing kite surfers became the first people to kitesurf over the pier.

It is sometimes separated as the only species of the genus Cichlopasser. The only place where this bird was found was Chichi-jima in the Ogasawara Islands; it might conceivably have inhabited Anijima and Ot≈çtojima, but this has not been borne out by observations or specimens. The species was only once observed by a naturalist, its discoverer Heinrich von Kittlitz. He encountered the thrush in the coastal woods where it usually kept to the ground; it may have been ground-nesting. The only specimens ever taken are in the Naturalis in Leiden (1), the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna (1), the Senckenbergmuseum in Frankfurt (1) and in the Zoological Museum, St. Petersburg (2). Extinction 1828 illustration The Bonin thrush is not among the birds observed or collected by the Beechey Pacific expedition which called at Chichi-jima in 1827. It was only found the following year, when Kittlitz took the five specimens; he considered them common enough around the landing site. It is unknown why Beechey's expedition, which landed at the same location, did not find them. Following the suggestion of two shipwrecked sailors (who were picked up by Beechey in 1827) that the island would make a good stopover station for whalers, settlement was begun in 1830. When Perry's first mission to Japan called at Chichi-jima in 1853, they did not find the bird again, just as naturalist William Stimpson of the Rodgers-Ringgold North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition in the following year. Instead, they encountered rats and feral goats, sheep, dogs and cats (feral pigs were already found by Kittlitz and may have been left by Beechey to provision possible future castaways). Just like the Bonin grosbeak, the Bonin thrush probably succumbed soon after 1830 to predation by the introduced mammals and habitat destruction.

Though she is uncomfortable being touched, she refuses to live her life in fear and uses her powers to help those she sees in trouble. One day, she meets Arou Naitou, a school mate who can see the past but does not feel he can do anything with his knowledge. They also meets Namiki Masahiro, another student who can also see the future but has more control over his power than Kanade and uses it purely for selfish reasons. Kanade, Arou, and Namiki must in a world where society might not accept them if their secret is ever known other than by their friends. On several occasions, people learn about their secret (the school doctor, people from Arou's middle school, family members), with varying results. For example, Arou's classmates from middle school react negatively, distressing him, while another classmate tries to use Arou's talent for the benefit of society.

Though she is uncomfortable being touched, she refuses to live her life in fear and uses her powers to help those she sees in trouble. In fact, cheerful and kind, Kanade does not always consider the consequences of her actions when she tries to change the outcome of her visions, often at the expense of her own safety (for example, trying to save her ex-firefighter grandfather from dying in a burning building as a young child). She can see the future once in a while. Kanade and Arou become a couple by the beginning of Volume 2. ; :He lost his mother a while ago, and always blamed himself. He lives with his father who is rarely at home, but they love each other all the same. An accomplished cook, Arou makes lunch for Kanade (and Namiki, the uninvited guest), who often mourns the fact that her cooking \\"wouldn't hold a candle to his\\". Shy and introverted, Arou opens up to no one but Kanade (and Namiki, his romantic rival with whom he often argues). Although Arou is quite popular and could easily go out with any girl in the school, he would never choose any of them over Kanade because Kanade is always able to cheer him up no matter how depressed or unhappy he is.

He will always see the \\"Past\\" by touching someone. It didn't use to be this way but his powers increased one night as he was desperately searching for his missing friend and mother. ; :Shunned by everyone because of his powers (including his parents and brother) he runs away and finds himself a job. Only his manager knows his secret, and they seem to really like each other and get along. Namiki is also very intelligent, and transferred from a very prestigious high school to go to Kanade and Arou's less prestigious school. Needless to say, he is at the top of his class. Once Namiki met Kanade, he realized that his powers could (and, arguably, should) be used for non-selfish reasons. He, like Arou, often worries about Kanade putting herself in danger to save other. In fact, he and Kanade meet when Kanade stops a man from crossing the street and getting hit by a car and he, unaware of the injury he has just avoided, tries to hit her only to be stopped by Namiki. He even got a dog (who is often central to the plot and to Namiki's development as a person) and a pet turtle because of Kanade. Namiki is rude and somewhat selfish, but he is really kind deep down inside, and he has an unrequited love for Kanade. He can also see the future, but it's more powerful than Kanade's and he only see the future when he wills it. ; :Kanade's best friend since elementary school. She is madly in love with Ezawa, and tries to change her personality to please him before Kanade convinces her that she should be true to herself. Not the best cook, Eri nonetheless tries to improve such domestic skills to please Ezawa, with varying success. Eri respects Kanade and Arou's powers, but does not learn about Namiki's. ; :Eri's somewhat loyal boyfriend, Ezawa never lacks attention from girls. His heart was softened by Eri. Other characters find it hard to read what he is thinking. Although he is invariably (and sometimes brutally) truthful, going to so far as to tell Eri with complete honesty how bad her cooking is, he nonetheless eats her less-than-appetizing cooking simply because she made it for him.

Yakov was born in Ostashkov into a family of artists. His father Mikhail Lukich Kolokolnikov-Voronin (1710 - after 1788) was a portraitist working in Ostashkov, and his uncles Mina and Fedot were artists working in Saint-Petersburg. Yakov at the time was documented as a Merchant of the 3d Guild (kupets 3ej gildii), a small retailer. In 1838, after presentation of his works to the Imperial Academy of Arts he received a certificate stating him to be a free (vneklassniy) artist. In 1841 he officially removed himself from the guild of merchants and painting became his only occupation. Yakov painted portraits, genre paintings, miniatures, and icons. Since he did not have a formal education he is usually classified as a primitivist. He was the maker of the silver Tsar Doors for the Transfiguration Cathedral in the Nilo- Stolbenskaya Pustyn Monastery. In 1805 he became the founder of the Ostashkov Theater. Yakov had three sons: Alexander (1818‚Äì1870), Ivan (1828‚Äì1865) and Mikhail (1830‚Äì1867). All of them became painters and were connected with the Ostashkov Theater.

He loses; the money he bet belongs to a mobster named Malini (Patrick Bauchau), who sends his enforcers Marlo (Roger Guenveur Smith) and Nate (B-Real) to retrieve him. They take him to the house, which has been stripped bare - everyone at the game was in on the con. They take Larry to an airport and kill him. The man and the robber (from the first scene) agree to cut cards for the money. The robber cuts a King and the man cuts the Ace of spades. They reach for their guns; the man gets his first and kills the robber, whose blood splatters on the ace. The three speculate that the story is an urban legend about \\"The Dean.\\" They talk about taking the Dean (Sylvester Stallone) down at a game with a $250,000 buy-in and total stakes of at least $2,000,000. After Vernon's departure, it's revealed that he and Tiffany had been lovers until Vernon left and Tiffany slept with Charlie. The next day, Malini's enforcers track down Charlie to a restaurant and Marlo demands the return of Malini's money. Charlie agrees to pay back $100,000, but Nate pulls a gun and a gunfight ensues. Tiffany arrives in time to kill Nate, but Marlo escapes. Charlie, Vernon and Tiffany escape and hide out with The Professor (Hal Holbrook), Vernon's former mentor, who is suspicious of Charlie and insists Vernon is better than him. Scarne arrives at the murder scene and realizes that the three are involved from a description by the witnesses. The three arrive at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel for the game, where they discover that the host is Malini. Vernon and the Dean bust the other players and agree to play five card stud. Dean's former lover Eve (Melanie Griffith) arrives, and they take a break. The three talk about the trouble Vernon is having and Tiffany speculates the cards are marked. Vernon discovers the Dean is using a \\"juice deck,\\" a deck marked to be readable when one's eyes are unfocused. In the final hand, Vernon mucks a card and deals the hand. He deals the Dean two pair, Kings and Queens, and himself a pair of Jacks with a 7 in the hole for the Dean to see. The Dean goes all in, and when Vernon is $50,000 short, Charlie and Tiffany make up the shortfall so he can call the bet. Before the cards are turned up, Marlo enters the room. Identifying the three as the team who conned Larry, Malini's muscle pull their guns and Tiffany pulls hers, then Scarne enters with his gun drawn. The Dean insists that the hand be completed and Vernon swaps out his hole 7 for a third Jack, which would beat the two pair he'd dealt the Dean. The room is stunned when the Dean turns up a third Queen to take the hand. Malini tells the three they can leave but advises them to stay out of the Los Angeles rackets. Charlie splits up the partnership with Vernon and, after Marlo's revelation that he was tipped off by Tiffany about shaking down Larry, with her as well. As Vernon sits alone in a diner, The Dean, Eve and Scarne enter, revealing the game was all an elaborate setup by the four of them to con Charlie and Tiffany. They split the take, but as he leaves the Dean pauses to flip the blood-stained Ace of spades to Vernon.

Additionally, Harthoorn's animal sanctuary was the inspiration for the television series Daktari. Early life Harthoorn was born in Rotterdam, but grew up in England, as his father was transferred there when the Dutch Unie company merged with the British Lever Bros company to form Unilever. His father was an economist for Unilever, who worked during the second World War as an economic adviser for the Dutch government in exile. Harthoorn studied veterinary science at the Veterinary College in London. During the Second World War he was trained as an officer at Sandhurst and Aldershot and became a commando, being one of the first to parachute into Arnhem during the relief of the Netherlands by Allied troops. After the war he graduated and continued his studies at the universities of Utrecht and Hannover. He took a PhD in the physiology of mammalian shock. Career After his Ph.D., Harthoorn went initially to Uganda, then to Kenya and Tanzania. There he studied the effects of various sedative drugs on wild African mammals and with a team invented the M-99 (etorphine hydrochloride) capture drug and refined the tranquilliser gun, or 'Capture gun', for darting animals. This was a breakthrough in animal transport, enabling the safe movement of rare animals to game sanctuaries from places in which they were at risk from poaching or urban development. The research effort and its eventual triumph is recorded in Dr Harthoorn's first book: The Flying Syringe. Capture gun technology is today used extensively in wildlife reserves, urban animal management, criminal human capture and zoological gardens. Before the invention of this technology animals were usually caught manually by being rounded up, penned, and transported without sedation, resulting in the death from stress of many hundreds of animals. In the 1960s, the Hungarian-born American film and TV producer Ivan Tors came to Kenya on holiday and visited an animal orphanage set up by Dr Harthoorn and his wife, Sue Hart. Tors was so impressed by the idea that he developed a TV series named Daktari (Swahili for 'doctor') which ran worldwide for several decades. The name has persisted in the 21st century in various forms in the names of several trademarked drugs. The animal characters from this series, Clarence the cross-eyed lion and Judy the chimpanzee, are still fondly remembered. The Kenyan experience is recorded in Sue Hart's book Life with Daktari. With Kenyan independence (1963) Dr Harthoorn's position as senior lecturer at the veterinary college in Nairobi was abruptly terminated (he was replaced without notice by one of his PhD students). He moved to South Africa and continued his work with large African mammals, including elephant and rhinoceros transport. His work was absolutely vital in the creation of many South African game reserves, in particular the Hluhluwe‚ÄìiMfolozi Park reserve in northern Kwazulu-Natal, where his work with Ian Player was vital in preserving the white rhinoceros. He also had a vital role in the saving of thousands of animals marooned on small islands created by the rising waters of the newly formed Kariba Dam in 1959-1960 in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). The campaign to save the animals was dubbed Operation Noah. Harthoorn was also a naturopath and homoeopath. He lived near Pretoria, South Africa, with his extended family, and continued to work lifelong in environmental preservation.

History Nantes used to be called Spring Hill. In 1856, Scottish settlers established their camps. It was called in Gaelic Drum-A-Vack. Later, French-Canadian families took over the camps in 1905. A train station and a postal office were added to the community in 1879 and in 1898, two sawmills, two telegraph offices, and two general stores were added as well. On July 6, 2013, a Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway train engine caught fire and was extinguished by the Nantes Fire Department. In the process of extinguishing the fire, fire department turned off the engine. Later MMA officials left the train unmanned and parked on the line. As the engine had been turned off, the brake system began to lose pressure, eventually dropping to the point the brakes could no longer hold the train in place. The train rolled away from Nantes, towards Lac-M√©gantic, Quebec, and derailed there, causing an explosion that destroyed around half of the downtown area and killed forty-two people.

The plot of the game revolves around a group of four mercenaries hired to eliminate a group of humans called the Viscerians.  Gameplay  The gameplay takes on a 3D-esque isometric view, in which the player chooses one of four mercenaries to lead through the levels. The characters act as lives, and if one were killed, the player still has the choice among the remaining mercenaries (rather than having multiple lives for one character). In the levels, the player must find key-cards, destroy guards, aliens, and robots, activate laser bridges, to complete an objective. Objectives include finding the exit to the level, assassination of an officer, escorting a defect or other important official, retrieving an item (usually a memory chip or the like), or obtaining a certain percentage of kills in the area. The four characters have very different abilities. For example, the large alien, Quogg, has a melee attack that will kill the standard human troops in just one hit (rather than the two required from the other characters). Also, each character has slight variations in weaponry that make for somewhat different combat experiences. Development During development the game's producer and designer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, commented, \\"We chose the isometric perspective because it meant you could see more of the playing area and also you could see an arrow go through the chest and you can see the result from behind too.\\" The soundtrack was written by Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff. Work on a port for the Sega Saturn began while the PlayStation version was still in development. However, it was never released. Reception Reviewers widely condemned the game's control system, in that the player aims their weapon using the four action buttons, saying it makes lining up shots frustratingly difficult and often leads to running out of ammunition. However, overall assessments of the game varied widely. GameSpots Jeff Kitts and an IGN reviewer both panned the game as a Loaded clone which lacks the enticing music, impressive graphical effects, and excitement which made that game popular, retaining only the mindless ultra-violent gameplay which had since been done to death. A Next Generation reviewer and Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly both acknowledged that Project Overkill is just the latest in a growing pile of mindless ultra-violent shooters, but contended that it is one of the better games of its breed and is enjoyable when taken for what it is. In contrast, Hsu's co-reviewers Shawn Smith and Sushi-X asserted that unlike other violent shooters, Project Overkill is deep and challenging.

Life and career Price was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her adoptive parents, the Prices, named her Luiese Esther after her grandmothers. Her first exposure to blues was through second-generation blueswoman Bonnie Raitt. Luiese later began to study the recordings of women blues singers such as Sippie Wallace and Victoria Spivey, from whose music Raitt herself had learned. Luiese moved to New Jersey, where she started schooling and began singing, then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where a summer parks program featured a talent contest in her 10th year, which she entered as Toni Price. This was her first recorded appearance on a Nashville stage, belting out \\"One Tin Soldier\\". Price's conservative family wasn't particularly musical: \\"Since I was adopted, they didn't know what to expect of me, and I believe you're born to do whatever it is you do - that maybe my [birth] parents were musical. Maybe not. But I knew as a little bitty child I was going to be a singer. I didn't know how you did it or know any musicians, but I knew I would get there.\\" Price musically grew in Nashville, where she recorded a few country and western singles. However, she felt frustrated by the 'rigid' Nashville music industry. She accepted an invitation to play the South by Southwest music festival in Austin in 1989. The town's music fans \\"just responded so lovingly that I said that's it. I know where I belong.\\" Here she met and learned from the locals, who included Clifford Antone, owner of Antone's blues nightclub, and Austin-area guitarists such as Derek O'Brien, who produced her second album, \\"Hey\\". Shortly after she began singing in country bars in Nashville, she met songwriter Gwil Owen, who wrote eight (one co-written) of the 15 songs on her debut, Swim Away (1993). Price cites vocalists Aretha Franklin, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Patsy Cline, and Ray Charles as her major influences. Swim Away and Price's second album, Hey (1995), received praise from both fans and critics. She has been often compared with Patsy Cline (\\"Patsy Cline on a Harley\\") and Bonnie Raitt. Price has won numerous awards, including Female Vocalist of the Year (1994‚Äì97), Album of the Year (Hey), Song of the Year (\\"Tumbleweed\\"), and Blues Artist of the Year. Her third album, Sol Power, was recorded at a club in Texas's remote town of Alpine. Sol Power (1999) is an acoustic live set from the Railroad Blues Club - in a tiny town in the picturesque southwestern desert lands of Texas. The landscape there inspired the band to, in Toni's words, \\"take it to the limit.\\" Low Down and Up (1999) followed, and then came Midnight Pumpkin, (2001), Born to Be Blue (2003), Talk Memphis (2007), and Cherry Sunday Orchestra (2010). Except for infrequent appearances in Houston, Dallas, or an occasional music festival elsewhere, Price stays close to home and her daughter. \\"I have a sweet situation here,\\" Price told John Burnett of NPR. \\"I don't have to go anywhere. People come and see me and I'm so, so lucky.\\" Price performed at the wedding of Julia Roberts and Daniel Moder in Taos, New Mexico, on July 4, 2002. Price has always performed music on her own terms; she refuses to go out and regularly did not even stand up while performing every Tuesday night for 15 years until June 2007 at the Continental Club in Austin, where music lovers feel that Toni Price has the same star potential as other musical talents such as Jimmie Vaughan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Lyle Lovett, and Nanci Griffith that the town produced. > \\"My favorite thing someone says to one of my friends is, 'Why isn't she > famous?'

Biblical Feminism and All We're Meant to Be Numerous scholars, whether they agree or disagree with the book's basic premise of gender equality, consider All We're Meant to Be to have been a major catalyst in launching the biblical feminist movement. It was preceded by two earlier articles Scanzoni wrote for Eternity magazine in 1966 and 1968.See \\"Women's Place: Silence or Service?\\" and \\"Christian Marriage: Patriarchy or Partnership?\\" (published as \\"Elevate Marriage to Partnership\\").

In As Christ Submits to the Church: A Biblical Understanding of Leadership and Mutual Submission, Alan G. Padgett speaks of a \\"new hermeneutic\\" for interpreting the Bible \\"regarding the place of women in church, home, and society\\" and asserts that \\"by all accounts, the first major book on this topic by neoevangelicals was Letha Scanzoni and Nancy Hardesty's All We're Meant to Be: A Biblical Approach to Women's Liberation.\\"As Christ Submits to the Church, Baker Academic, 2011, p. 8. One of the conservative critics of evangelical feminism, Wayne Grudem, states that the book reflects a \\"liberal tendency to reject the authority of Scripture\\" and that \\"while egalitarian positions had been advocated since the 1950s by theologically liberal Protestant writers, no evangelical books took such a position until 1974 . . .[when] freelance writers Letha Scanzoni and Nancy Hardesty published their groundbreaking book, All We're Meant to Be\\"Evangelical Feminism: A New Path to Liberalism? 2006. Arguing similarly, another critic, theology professor Jack Cottrell, has posted an online article titled \\"How Feminism Invaded the Church\\"Jack Cottrell, \\"How Feminism Invaded the Church\\". May 8, 2013. in which he writes: \\"The major feminist writings during this period began with All We're Meant To Be: A Biblical Approach to Women's Liberation, by Letha Scanzoni and Nancy Hardesty (1974, then later editions). This was the early 'bible' of Evangelical feminism; it was called 'ground-breaking' and 'epoch- making.'\\" And, in Cottrell's opinion, it, along with other books following such an approach to Scripture, falsely interpreted what the Bible teaches. According to the Encyclopedia of Women in Religion in North AmericaEncyclopedia of Women in Religion in North America, Indiana University Press, 2006. All We're Meant to Be \\"became in many respects for evangelical women what the Church and the Second Sex (1972) by Mary Daly was for mainstream religious women\\" (p. 469).

Another Christian View, coauthored with Virginia Ramey Mollenkott, was published in 1978, the publisher reported that \\"some 16 different titles on evangelical Christianity and homosexuality [were] currently being published, with the Scanzoni and Mollenkott volume being the only one which takes a positive stand.Clayton Carlson, Harper & Row Publisher, press release at the launch of Is the Homosexual My Neighbor?, St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco, CA, June 20, 1978. Scanzoni‚Äôs most recent book is What God Has Joined Together: A Christian Case for Gay Marriage (HarperOne, 2005, 2006), coauthored with psychologist David G. Myers. In an added feature for the 2006 paperback edition, the authors interview each other and tell how they came to hold the views presented in their book‚Äîviews that have been both praised and criticized. Taking issue with Myers and Scanzoni's views, Al Mohler, President of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, declares, \\"Their book offers positive proof that what drives proponents of same-sex marriage is a psychological worldview that is directly at odds with the worldview of the Bible.\\"R. Albert Mohler Jr., \\"A Christian Case for Gay Marriage?\\", Albert Mohler, August 26, 2005. Rosemary Radford Ruether sums up the book's arguments and concludes: \\"Scanzoni and Meyers [sic] argue that accepting gay marriage, far from threatening marriage, will confirm and strengthen the ideal of marriage itself for all of us, heterosexuals and homosexuals.\\"Rosemary Radford Ruether, \\"Why Marriage between Homosexuals Is Good for Marriage\\", Patheos, July 7, 2009.

The incident appears as part of the legends of Midas in classical times, but not all of the legend appears in the fairy tale. Synopsis The emperor Trojan had goat's ears, but kept this fact a secret from the populace. Every day, he had a new barber whom he would ask if he noticed anything strange; when the man answered that he had goat's ears, he was put to death. One day, an apprentice went, and said that he saw nothing strange, so he remained as the emperor's barber. The apprentice found his secret troubling him. His master advised him to tell him, the master, or his pastor, or to whisper it into a hole in the ground. The apprentice dug a hole, whispered into it that the emperor had goat's ears, and filled it up again. An elder tree grew there, someone cut a branch and made a flute, but the only thing the flute would play was \\"The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears.\\" The news spread, and the emperor discovered it and wormed the secret out of the apprentice. He had the last branch cut and found the flute made from it was the same. He spared the apprentice's life but did not keep him on as his barber.

It was an American pioneering producer of many types of agricultural machinery, most notably threshing machines and large tractors. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co. purchased Advance-Rumley in 1931. The company's main works would become what was later known as the \\"La Porte plant\\". Thanks to various mergers and acquisitions, the company's origins stretched as far back as 1853. However, the origin of the two components of the corporate nameAdvance Thresher Company and M. Rumely Companywere somewhat newer, though still long-lived in the agricultural equipment industry. The company was organized under the name Advance-Rumely in 1915. History =Advance Thresher and M. Rumely= Advance Thresher Co. steam traction engine Rumely Oil Pull tractor Rumely Oil Pull tractor \\"L\\" Rumely Oil Pull tractor movie Meinrad Rumely emigrated from Germany in 1848, joining his brother John Rumely in the operation of a foundry in La Porte, Indiana. This operation had expanded by 1859 into the production of corn shellers and complete threshing machines powered by horses. Following success in this new field, Meinrad then bought out his brother's portion of the business and incorporated it as the M. Rumely Company by 1887. In 1895, the line expanded to include steam-powered traction engines. Meinrad died in 1904, but his sons continued to manage the business. Rumely's most famous product, the Rumely Oil Pull tractors, powered by hot-bulb engine using kerosene, was first developed in 1909 and began selling to the public by 1910. Meanwhile, Advance Thresher Company was founded in 1881 with a factory in Battle Creek, Michigan. In addition to their namesake threshing machines, this company was a prolific producer of steam traction engines. =Acquisitions and mergers= From 1911-1912, M. Rumely Company began purchasing other firms in the agricultural equipment business. Both Advance Thresher Company and Gaar-Scott & Company of Richmond, Indiana were acquired during 1911. Then, in 1912, Rumely expanded further with the purchase of Northwest Thresher Company of Stillwater, Minnesota and the American-Abell Engine & Thresher Company of Toronto. All these companies were first reorganized in 1913 as two connected firms: the existing M. Rumely Co. Inc. (effectively the manufacturing side), and the new Rumely Products Co. (the sales and distribution side). A further reorganization brought about the final Advance-Rumely Company by 1915, a move which both streamlined the organization and highlighted its famous forebears. Advance-Rumely hadn't quite finished its expansion goals, either: the Aultman- Taylor Company of Mansfield, Ohio was picked up in 1923. =Consolidation and takeover= Despite all of the history and diversity in engineering acquired along with all of their corporate assets during the 1910s, most of this was left by the wayside as Advance-Rumely sought to fold everything under its new brand name or that of Rumely. The general financial collapse of the Great Depression, beginning in 1929 and into the early 1930s, began to take its toll on Advance-Rumely. As early as January 1930, the Rumely management began seeking a buyer for the company. Correspondence with Otto Falk, president of the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, proved fruitful. Allis-Chalmers agreed to take over the firm and did so by May 1931. Rumely had discontinued its traction engine lines in favor of newer-style tractors. But Allis-Chalmers had a line of those that was quite successful. The remaining Rumely-branded tractors were discontinued. Allis-Chalmers was more interested in Advance- Rumely's line of threshing and harvesting machines (not to mention the sprawling plants that built them). Also, Allis-Chalmers bought Rumely's extensive dealer network, and instantly converted to the complete Allis- Chalmers product line. The \\"La Porte plant\\", as Advance-Rumely's main headquarters was now called, became known as the \\"Harvester Capitol of the World\\" thanks to its eventual production of Allis-Chalmers' successful All- Crop harvester line. Allis-Chalmers would eventually succumb to bankruptcy and the dismantling of its vast business interests in 1985. But, by that time Advance-Rumely was only a memory.

It occurs near the end of Rodgers and Hart's 1936 Broadway musical comedy On Your Toes. Slaughter is the story of a hoofer who falls in love with a dance hall girl who is then shot and killed by her jealous boyfriend. The hoofer then shoots the boyfriend. The ballet is integrated into the plot of the musical by the device of having two gangsters watching it from box seats in the theatre in which it is staged. They have orders to shoot the leading dancer (played by Ray Bolger in the original production). The dancer, who has been warned just in time, evades them by suddenly dancing at full speed even after the ballet actually ends, and finally two police officers enter and arrest the gangsters. Slaughter on Tenth Avenue was danced by Ray Bolger and Tamara Geva in the original stage production of On Your Toes, and by Eddie Albert and Vera Zorina in the film version. In Words and Music, the 1948 Technicolor film biography of Rodgers and Hart, the ballet was danced by Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen, with a somewhat revised, more tragic storyline, and new choreography by Kelly (in Kelly's version, the boyfriend, in addition to killing the dance hall girl, also kills the hoofer).

Research and innovation  The Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman has strong ties with industries - especially those located in the Province of Kerman, which has brought many funding and financing opportunities for the University. Since the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman is a state university, research funds are provided by the Government of Iran. Many ISI journal papers and conference papers are published regularly by faculties, researchers and students of the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman.  Endowment  The Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman is a public university and its funding is provided by the government of Iran. For the top ranks of the national university entrance exam, education is free in all state-owned and public universities. Students with ranks below the normal capacity of the universities will be required to pay part or all of the tuition.  Language of instruction  Although the official language of instruction in the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman is Persian, a large number of lecture materials, reference books, homework assignments, and even exams are in English. This is especially true for the postgraduate students who are encouraged to use English textbooks and materials as their main references.  Academic year  The academic year is divided into three academic terms, determined by the university. The first academic term usually starts on the 23rd of September. The second Academic term usually starts on the 11th of February, and the Summer term usually starts from the 10th of July.  Publishing  The University's publishing arm, the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman Press, has published many different academic books and journals.  Architecture  The two major campuses of the university have different styles of architecture. The Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman - the Afzalipour Campus has a modernist style of architecture inspired by the vernacular architecture of the region. The architecture of this university is very distinct in that almost all of the colleges are connected. All of the colleges have a similar style of architecture. Afzalipour assigned Bonyan Consulting Company to prepare a campus master plan and design the buildings of the university Master plan and design concepts were developed to tackle the problem of uncertainty. It was set as a primary goal to have a flexible design both inside the buildings and in their inter-connections. In each stage of development, the campus was to be a complete and coherent whole, still allowing for future expansion without hindering the functioning departments. The master plan was inspired by the organic urban grid of Kerman city centre that has historically evolved in response to climatic conditions of a desert town. The height of the main building blocks are restricted to 3, optimizing seismological, climatic, economic and circulation considerations. Interconnection of the blocks on the upper stories integrates educational and research spaces, thus enhancing flexibility. These also provide shadow and shelter for open pathways under-passing below. Careful distancing of blocks, along with articulate projections of the buildings, allow natural and controlled lighting for inner spaces while creating ample shadow for the inner courtyards. This general arrangement, permits one to cross the whole campus through courtyards and archways with minimal detours, under protection from direct sunlight or rain if needed, or to access other departments from within the buildings and through connecting corridors and internal patios. Currently, two new colleges are being built, an extension to the college of Agriculture, which connects the Saba Faculty of Art and Architecture to the rest of colleges at the campus and also the new college of Management and Economics, which is connected to the rest of colleges via the newly built College of Geology. The Campus of Technology and Engineering has also a unique style of architecture but very different from the style of the Afzalipour Campus.  International study and exchange  The Office of International Exchange Programs was established to provide students and faculty with exchange opportunities, including sending and hosting visiting scholars, aiding faculty members in arranging international study tours, developing exchange agreements with universities around the world.  Student organisations  There are several student organizations active throughout the university. Most of these organizations are only concentrated on academic activities with some also interested and active in political issues.

It was engaged at the Battle of Secessionville near Charleston before being sent northward for duty in Virginia. Upon reaching Virginia in July 1862, the 51st Georgia was assigned to Drayton's Brigade within the Army of Northern Virginia. After the Battle of Antietam in September, Robert E. Lee decided to reorganize his army for more efficiency, and the 51st Regiment was permanently assigned to Paul Jones Semmes's brigade. The subsequent brigade commanders were Goode Bryan and James P. Simms. The 51st stayed in this brigade for the duration of the Civil War. The regiment was a part of the Army of Northern Virginia from July 1862 until its surrender at Appomattox Court House, except during James Longstreet's 1863 independent expedition to Georgia and East Tennessee.

After the fall of Wu in 280, he continued serving under the Jin dynasty. He is sometimes tied to a legend about the Temple of the Five Immortals in present- day Guangzhou, Guangdong. Life Teng Xiu was from Xi'e County (), Nanyang Commandery (), which is around present-day Nanzhao County, Henan. He started his career as an official in the state of Eastern Wu in the late Three Kingdoms period and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xi'e () for his contributions. During the reign of the fourth and last Wu emperor Sun Hao, Teng Xiu succeeded Xiong Mu () as the Inspector () of Guang Province () and was known for being a capable governor. Around 279, when Guo Ma () started a rebellion against Wu rule in Guang Province, Sun Hao ordered Teng Xiu to lead Wu imperial forces to suppress the revolt. He also promoted Teng Xiu to the rank of Governor (), gave him an additional appointment as General Who Guards the South (), and granted him full authority and control over the military forces in Guang Province. In 280, while Teng Xiu was busy dealing with the rebels, enemy forces from Eastern Wu's rival state, the Jin dynasty, invaded Wu. Teng Xiu then led troops from Guang Province to counter the invasion, but by the time he reached Baqiu (Â∑¥‰∏ò; present-day Yueyang, Hunan), Sun Hao had surrendered to the Jin dynasty, thus bringing an end to Eastern Wu's existence. Teng Xiu was so depressed that he wept and returned to Guang Province. Later, he surrendered to the Jin dynasty as well, along with L√º Feng (Èñ≠Ë±ê; the Inspector of Guang Province) and Wang Yi (ÁéãÊØÖ; the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery). Some time later, Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty issued an imperial decree to appoint Teng Xiu as General Who Stabilises the South () and Governor of Guang Province, in addition to granting him full authority and control over Guang Province as he did during Sun Hao's reign. Emperor Wu also enfeoffed Teng Xiu as the Marquis of Wudang (). Teng Xiu died in 288. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

In 258, he defected to Wu's rival state, Cao Wei, and became a general under Wei. Life Tang Zi was from Licheng Commandery (Âà©ÂüéÈÉ°; between southeast of present-day Linshu County, Shandong and northwest of present-day Ganyu District, Lianyungang, Jiangsu). In 225, Cai Fang () started a rebellion in Licheng Commandery, killed the commandery Administrator Xu Ji (), and nominated Tang Zi to be their leader. The Wei emperor Cao Pi ordered Ren Fu (), Duan Zhao (), Wang Ling and L√º Qian () to lead troops to suppress the revolt. After the Wei forces defeated the rebels and retook Licheng Commandery, Tang Zi fled south to Wu via the sea and became a Wu military officer. Between 235 and 236, Tang Zi participated in a campaign against the restive Shanyue tribes in Wu territories along with the Wu generals L√º Dai and Wu Can. After the campaign, he was promoted to the rank of a general for his contributions. Later, he and Wu Can led 3,000 troops to attack the Shanyue led by Dong Si () but could not overcome the enemy until reinforcements led by another Wu general, Zhou Fang, showed up. In 239, he joined L√º Dai in quelling a revolt by Liao Shi (). In 252, Tang Zi fought at the Battle of Dongxing against Wu's rival state, Wei, alongside other Wu generals such as Liu Zan, L√º Ju and Ding Feng. He was promoted to General of the Vanguard (), granted imperial authority, and enfeoffed as a marquis for his achievements in the battle. In 256, Tang Zi joined Wen Qin, L√º Ju, Liu Zuan () and Zhu Yi to resist a Wei invasion in the regions around the Huai and Si rivers (in present-day Anhui). In the same year, after the Wu regent Sun Jun died, Tang Zi sided with Sun Jun's cousin Sun Chen in a power struggle and killed L√º Ju, thus clearing the way for Sun Chen to succeed Sun Jun as the regent of Wu. In 257, when the Wei general Zhuge Dan started a rebellion in Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui), he sent his son Zhuge Jing as a hostage to Wu in exchange for support from Wu against Wei. In the following year, Sun Chen ordered Wen Qin, Tang Zi, Quan Yi (), Quan Duan (), Wang Zuo () and others to lead 30,000 troops to Shouchun to assist Zhuge Dan in his rebellion against Wei forces led by the Wei regent Sima Zhao. When the tide turned against Zhuge Dan by early 258, Zhuge Dan and Tang Zi tried to break out of the siege but failed. After being captured by Wei forces, Tang Zi agreed to surrender and defect to Wei. Sima Zhao appointed him as General Who Stabilises Distant Lands (). As Sima Zhao treated the surrendered Wu soldiers well, in return the Wu government did not harm Tang Zi's family members, who were still in Wu when he defected to Wei. In 262, when Sima Zhao was planning an invasion of Wei's other rival state, Shu, he ordered Tang Zi to supervise the construction of warships to be used in a later campaign against Wu. Nothing about Tang Zi was recorded in history after that. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Habitat The glossy-mantled manucode live in lowland rainforest, riverine and monsoon forests, forest edge, swamp-forest and woodlands. Description Manucodia ater. Museum specimen The glossy-mantled manucode is medium-sized, around 42 cm long, glossed green, blue and purple black with a red iris, black bill, long graduated tail and somewhat elongated upper breast and neck feathers. Both sexes are similar. The female is a slightly smaller than the male. In appearance, the glossy-mantled manucode resembles and is difficult to distinguished from its nearest relatives, the crinkle-collared and jobi manucodes. Biology These birds have diurnal habits. They tend to move alone or in pairs, rarely in small groups: They spend most of their time looking for food among the branches of trees, ready to hide themselves in the thick vegetation when disturbed. They are not particularly timid, but it is easier to hear their calls or flights rather than observe them directly. The diet consists mainly of fruits, figs and arthropods. Bibliography * Beehler, B.

The 68 segments appeared as part of three different programs during that time, packaged with similar shorts featuring The Adventures of Superboy and other DC Comics superheroes. History These adventures were the first time that Superman (and his guise of Clark Kent), Lois Lane and Perry White had been seen in animated form since the Fleischer brothers had immortalized them in the Superman short films of the 1940s. The first TV series produced by Filmation Associates, The New Adventures of Superman was extremely popular in its Saturday morning time slot and employed the services of several DC Comics writers including George Kashdan, Leo Dorfman and Bob Haney. Many of the character designs (later based upon the artwork of Superman artist Curt Swan in the show's third season) stayed true to their comic book counterparts; iconic shirt-rip shots and related transformations from Clark Kent into Superman were incorporated into almost every episode, and such lines as \\"Up, up, and away!\\" and \\"This is a job for Superman!\\" were also borrowed from both the comics and the original Superman radio series. In addition, this series marked the animation debuts of Jimmy Olsen and classic Superman villains such as Lex Luthor, Brainiac, the Toyman, the Prankster, Titano, and Mister Mxyzptlk, as well as the inclusion of new villains like the Warlock and the Sorcerer. Due to a limited production budget, stock animation was often re-used for certain shots of Superman flying (or switching identities from Clark Kent into the Man of Steel), while character movement was often kept at a minimum; this would later become a trademark of Filmation's animated productions. Producer Lou Scheimer also recruited Clayton \\"Bud\\" Collyer and Joan Alexander, veterans of the Superman radio show and the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons, for the voices of Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane respectively. Jackson Beck, who had narrated, and provided the character voice of Perry White on, the radio show, reprised those same roles for the cartoon version, while Jack Grimes, who had played Jimmy Olsen in its later years, took that part here as well. For this series, Collyer returned to the same vocal technique he had perfected on the radio show to play the Man Of Steel. While in the identity of Clark Kent, Collyer would keep his voice lighter while projecting a sense of weakness. But whenever the mild-mannered reporter would change into his true identity of Superman, Collyer's voice would deepen dramatically into a heroic baritone. Alexander departed after the first season and was replaced by Julie Bennett in later seasons. The theme music for the show was composed by John Marion Gart. Mort Weisinger, editor of the Superman comics, acted as story consultant for the animated series, and made sure to include characters from his era, like Titano and Brainiac. Despite its success, the series sparked the anger of Action for Children's Television, a grassroots organization formed in 1968 and dedicated to improving the quality of television programming offered to children, due to Superman throwing punches and other action-related violence which the group found objectionable. As a result, the series was soon cancelled, and future cartoons would not allow for such comic book violence. Superman subsequently appeared in ABC's long-running animated series Super Friends (1973), produced by Hanna-Barbera, whose rights to DC Comics characters were gradually transferred from Filmation. Episode list =Season 1 (1966‚Äì1967)= The series premiered on September 10, 1966 as a \\"30-minute\\" program titled The New Adventures of Superman, featuring two Superman segments with one The Adventures of Superboy short in between.

The village was built on and around a hill, the second highest of the French capital after Montmartre. The composer and conductor Jules Pillevesse (1837‚Äì1903) was born in Belleville. History The area was inhabited for many years by people who worked the local quarries, vintners and other merchants. A commune was created in 1789. Its name is derived from belle vue (literally \\"beautiful view\\") and its territory extended to what is today the Parc des Buttes Chaumont and the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

She played at the collegiate level for the University of Arizona, then seven seasons of professional women's basketball with the Houston Comets, Seattle Storm, Minnesota Lynx, and Sacramento Monarchs in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She has played internationally with Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine. Barnes has also served as a TV color analyst broadcasting WNBA Seattle Storm games. Barnes is married to Salvo Coppa, a basketball coach she met in Italy. The wedding date was July 4, 2012. Early years Barnes grew up in San Diego, California and attended Mission Bay Senior High School in San Diego. She is the daughter of NFL player Pete Barnes, although he divorced Adia's mother when she was three.https://tucson.com/sports/arizonawildcats/basketball/arizona-coach-adia- barnes-finally-got-to-know-her- father/article_9dd8efd3-0b00-5026-a1dd-26b558d40300.html Over the course of her high school career, she amassed 1112 blocks, the most ever recorded by a female high school basketball player, 253 blocks ahead of second place Chris Enger. College At 5'11\\", Barnes wasn't as tall as most post position players at the highly regarded Division I schools. The University of Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini initially didn't think she would be able to play at that position, even after watching film of her play. However, after seeing her in person, she immediately offered Barnes a scholarship, who enrolled in the school for the 1995 season. Her physical play earned her a comparison to Charles Barkley from a Sports Illustrated writer. In her freshman year she earned the Pac-10 freshman of the year award, the first player from Arizona to win such an award. In Barnes's sophomore year, the team earned a WNIT bid and won the championship. Barnes was named the tournament Most Valuable Player. As a junior, Barnes helped the team to their first ever NCAA appearance. They won their first game against Western Kentucky, and then lost by six points to the second seed in their bracket, Georgia. She went on to set 22 individual records for the Arizona Wildcats, including career points and rebounds, many of which are still records. She would go on to become the first women's player in Arizona to be drafted into the professional leagues. WNBA career Although successful as an undersized post in college, Barnes knew that she would not be able to continue as a post player in the pros, so she decide to transform herself into a guard. She originally was signed by the now-defunct Sacramento Monarchs, playing in 29 games and earning a starting position in 16 games. However, she was then traded to Minnesota and then Cleveland, and saw her playing time dwindle. She played overseas to work on her skills and concentrated on becoming a specialist. In 2002, she was traded to the Seattle Storm, who were picked to finish sound to last in their division. With Sue Bird and Lauren Jackson on the team, Storm coach Lin Dunn wasn't looking for a scorer, so Barnes concentrated on becoming a shut-down defender. Her work effort paid off, and she helped the team to make the playoffs in only their third year of existence. International Barnes also played internationally with Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine. She played for several Euroleague teams, Priolo(Italy), Elitzur Rampla(Israel), Napoli BK(Italy), UMMC(Russia), Mersin(Turkey), and Pozzuoli(Italy). Broadcasting In 2007, Barnes became a color commentator for the radio coverage of the Storm. She had some experience as a commentator for the World Championship games. The games were held in Brazil, but the broadcasts were done in a remote studio, making it a challenge. As of 2012, she did broadcasts of Storm games for both radio and TV, along with play-by-play announcer Dick Fain. Barnes was also the color commentator for the radio broadcasts of Seattle University Redhawks women's basketball games during the 2010-11 season. Coaching In October 2010, Barnes was named Director of Player and Coach Development at Seattle Academy. Barnes was approached by her Arizona coach Joan Bonvicini to see if she was interested in coaching. At the time, Barnes was still actively playing for the Storm, and turned down the opportunity. However, she enjoyed working at camps, so when the new head coach of the University of Washington, Kevin McGuff, asked her in 2011 to consider coaching, he was able to persuade her, and she joined the Huskies as an assistant coach. Barnes was named head women's basketball coach at the University of Arizona on April 4, 2016. After a fairly rough start to her coaching career, Barnes entered her third season with the Wildcats, with high hopes. The team began the year 12-1, but ultimately struggled when it came to Pac-12 conference play. After finishing the regular season with 17 wins, their most in the regular season since 2010-11, Arizona entered the conference tournament as the No. 8 seed, knocking off USC to begin tournament play. The Wildcats would finish the year 18-13, before ultimately being selected for the Women's National Invitation Tournament. The Wildcats guided by Barnes, would make it to the WNIT Final, knocking off Northwestern to become the 2019 WNIT Champions.

Ewell Townview Magnet Center, which houses this school The Judge Barefoot Sanders Law Magnet or the Law Magnet, formerly the School of Government, Law, & Law Enforcement, is a magnet secondary school located in Dallas, Texas, United States. It is a part of the Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center and is within the Dallas Independent School District. It gives students the opportunity to explore careers in law, law enforcement, and government. The school has three sections, Criminal Justice, Pre-Law and Government. Students have the option to enroll in either one. It provides students with a range of experiential learning activities, including project-based learning in the classroom and courtroom observations, as well as meaningful internships that allow students to experience the practice of law and law enforcement in a variety of settings. The school was renamed in honor of Judge Barefoot Sanders in 2010.  History In the spring of 2007, Robert L. Giesler, the longest serving principal of the Law Magnet, announced that he was retiring. While the school board tried to find a permanent principal, Lucy Livingston, served as the intern dean at the school. In March 2008, Mr. Anthony Palagonia, was appointed as the Law Magnet Principal. Mr. Palagonia had been Assistant Principal at Richardson High School and had been associated with the Richardson Law Magnet in various capacities for 20 years. In addition to bringing his experience in magnet schools, Mr. Palagonia brings his experience as a former practicing attorney and city court judge. He left in 2014, and there was a sub-principal for 2014-2015. In 2015, Mr. Dang became the permanent principal. At the conclusion of the 2015-2016, Garet Feimster was hired as the new principal of the school. Although the Law Magnet does not offer competitive sports, (students have the option of competing under their local area high school), the school has a wide selection of competitive academic organizations. These include, but are not limited to: SkillsUSA (also known as VICA), Lincoln- Douglas Debate, Policy Debate, Mock Trial, Close Up Foundation, TAFE, One Act Play and Destination ImagiNation. In 2016, the debate team won the Texas Forensic Association State Championship in policy debate. On March 3, 2018, the Mock Trial team won 3rd place in the Texas High School Mock Trial competition. Notable alumni have attended respectable institutions of higher education such as: Harvard University, Columbia University, Brown, Stanford, UPenn, The University of Texas, MIT, Georgetown, Smith, University of Chicago, Notre Dame, Wellesley, SMU, Texas A&M;, University of Texas at San Antonio, Yale, Cornell. Several alumni of the school have gone on to become lawyers and federal law enforcement professionals. One alumnus, George Rodriguez, recently ran for U.S. Congress. The school has recently established a foundation known as the Friends of Dallas Law Magnet High School. Its purpose is to raise funds to support existing programs and fund other opportunities for Law Magnet students. In 2012, it was ranked 5th out of the top 10 high schools in North Texas by Children at Risk, a research and advocacy institute dedicated to helping children. In 2018, it was ranked as 5th out of all high schools in the Dallas Independent School District and 38th in Texas by US News and World Report.

Parsons has also released solo albums and played in bands including Nashville West, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Parsons Green. Along with guitarist Clarence White, he is credited with inventing the B-Bender (also known as the StringBender)‚Äîa device which allows a guitarist to emulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar. The device is often referred to as the Parsons/White B-Bender, a trademarked name. Early career and the Byrds Gene Parsons was born on September 4, 1944 on his family's farm in Morongo Valley in the Mojave Desert, California. His professional musical career began when he joined up with guitarist and Fiddle player Gib Guilbeau in the duo Guilbeau & Parsons. Later the duo was joined by Clarence White, former guitarist with the Kentucky Colonels, and bassist Wayne Moore to form the band Nashville West, named after a club where the band often performed. After the dissolution of Nashville West, Parsons was brought into the Byrds by White (who had recently become the band's guitarist), to replace drummer Kevin Kelley. Parsons remained with the band for four years, principally as a drummer, but he also contributed guitar, banjo, harmonica and a number of his own songs to the albums Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, Ballad of Easy Rider, (Untitled), Byrdmaniax and Farther Along. Post- Byrds career His first solo album, Kindling, was released in 1973 on Warner Bros. Records, after the Byrds broke up. Although Kindling received positive reviews in music publications such as Rolling Stone, it failed to reach the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart. Following this, Parsons joined the Flying Burrito Brothers, like other ex-Byrds Chris Hillman, Gram Parsons (no relation) and Michael Clarke had done before him. While he was a member of Burrito Brothers, with Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Chris Ethridge, Skip Battin, Joel Scott Hill and Gib Gilbeau, Parsons contributed a number of songs to the band's Flying Again and Airborne albums, including \\"Wind and Rain\\", \\"Sweet Desert Childhood\\", and \\"Out of Control\\". After his tenure with the Flying Burrito Brothers ended in 1978, Parsons released a second solo album entitled Melodies in 1979. Since the mid-1980s, he has also released two albums with his ex-wife, California based folk musician Meridian Green, under the moniker of Parsons Green. During 1994, he was a member of \\"The Byrds Celebration\\", a tribute band formed by guitarist Terry Rogers that had originated with former Byrds' drummer Michael Clarke, who had died in 1993, and which also included fellow ex-Byrd Skip Battin. Parsons was also part of the band Haywire (not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name), along with Joe Craven, Bill Douglass and Will Siegel, and features on the band's 1998 album, Bluegrass Christmas. In 2001, Parsons released a third solo album, this time a live recording, entitled Gene Parsons in Concert - I Hope They Let Us In, which was released on his own StringBender record label. He also collaborated with British singer-songwriter Julian Dawson on the 2002 album Hillbilly Zen. Parsons teamed with David Hayes in 2016 to release the Gene Parsons & David Hayes album, and, in 2017, the pair formed the Mendocino Quartet with Gwyneth Moreland and Steven Bates, releasing the album Way Out There. Other work As well as his work with Nashville West, the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers, Parsons has also played on records by Arlo Guthrie, the Everly Brothers, the Gosdin Brothers, Randy Newman, and Elliott Murphy. He also played on the soundtrack album of the 1970 film Performance, contributing both drums and guitar. His work on the album included playing drums on the track \\"Memo From Turner\\", which would end up being Mick Jagger's first single release as a solo artist. Gene Parsons currently lives in Caspar, California, spending much of his time running his StringBender company and customizing guitars with his B-Bender device in his machine shop.

Brugman, in Litauische Volkslieder und M√§rchen (1882).Leskien & Brugman,original version in German on zeno.org  Synopsis  Illustration by Henry Justice Ford from Andrew Lang's Fairy Books Three princes had a stepsister. The four went hunting one day and were about to shoot a wolf when it offered to give each prince a cub if they did not. The same thing happened with a lioness, a fox, a hare, a boar and a bear. Then they came to a crossroads. The oldest told his brothers to each mark a birch there: if they returned and saw blood flowing, they would know that that brother was dead, but if milk flowed, he was alive. Then they asked their stepsister which one she wanted to go with; she went with the oldest. The oldest prince found a den of robbers. With the aid of his beasts, he killed all but one, who feigned death. He and his stepsister spent the night there. The next day, he went hunting. The surviving robber forced the stepsister to bring him magical potions that healed him, and had her trick her brother into letting her tie his hands behind his back. It was a test of his strength and required three cords. On the third, the robber appeared, brandishing a knife. The prince tricked the robber into letting him blow his horn. The animals came and killed the robber. He chained his stepsister to the wall to let her repent, and put a great bowl before her, telling her he would not see her until she filled it with her tears. The princess was about to be handed over to a dragon. The oldest prince went to the seashore where she was to be handed over and with his animals killed the dragon. The princess had him come into the coach to drive back to the castle and gave him a ring and half of her handkerchief. But the coachman and footman killed him to claim they had killed the dragon. The animals gathered around the body. Then the wolf had an idea. It killed an ox and set the fox as a guard over it. It caught a crow, and the lion told it they would not kill it if it got them the waters to revive the prince. It did so, and the prince went to the town. The princess was to marry the coachman, but the prince proved himself the dragon-slayer by the ring and the handkerchief, so the coachman was thrown in prison and the prince married the princess. One day he went hunting and lost his way. He asked a witch if he might stay the night, but she claimed to fear his animals and asked to touch them with a rod. He agreed, but it turned them, and him, into stone. The youngest brother returned to the crossroads and saw that ill had befallen his oldest brother. He went down that road, and the people of the town took him for their prince. The princess knew he was not her husband and begged him to find the prince. He went, found the same witch, and suffered the same fate. The second brother returned to the crossroads and saw that ill had befallen both his brothers. He went down the same road as his oldest brother, and again only the princess knew who he was. He went out to search, found the witch, but told her that only he could strike his animals. She gave him the rod, and he touched the fox with it, and he saw it turned it to stone. Then he threatened her with his animals unless she restored his brothers, so she did so and they returned to the town.  Motifs  The betrayal by a female relative is also featured in The Prince and the Princess in the Forest and The Blue Belt, where the treachery comes from his mother. The rescue by the other brother is also common, though it is generally only one other, as in The Enchanted Doe, The Two Brothers, The Gold-Children, and The Knights of the Fish.

The theorem is named for Henri Lebesgue. Statement For a Lebesgue integrable real or complex-valued function f on Rn, the indefinite integral is a set function which maps a measurable set A to the Lebesgue integral of f \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{1}_A, where \\\\mathbf{1}_{A} denotes the characteristic function of the set A. It is usually written :: A \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{A}f\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda, with Œª the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The derivative of this integral at x is defined to be ::\\\\lim_{B \\\\rightarrow x} \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_{B}f \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda, where B denotes the volume (i.e., the Lebesgue measure) of a ball B centered at x, and B ‚Üí x means that the diameter of B tends to 0. The Lebesgue differentiation theorem states that this derivative exists and is equal to f(x) at almost every point x ‚àà Rn. In fact a slightly stronger statement is true. Note that: ::\\\\left\\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_{B}f(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda(y) - f(x)\\\\right = \\\\left\\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_{B}(f(y) - f(x))\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda(y)\\\\right \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_{B}f(y) -f(x)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda(y). The stronger assertion is that the right hand side tends to zero for almost every point x. The points x for which this is true are called the Lebesgue points of f. A more general version also holds. One may replace the balls B by a family \\\\mathcal{V} of sets U of bounded eccentricity. This means that there exists some fixed c > 0 such that each set U from the family is contained in a ball B with U \\\\ge c \\\\, B. It is also assumed that every point x ‚àà Rn is contained in arbitrarily small sets from \\\\mathcal{V}. When these sets shrink to x, the same result holds: for almost every point x, :: f(x) = \\\\lim_{U \\\\rightarrow x, \\\\, U \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}} \\\\frac{1}{U} \\\\int_U f \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda. The family of cubes is an example of such a family \\\\mathcal{V}, as is the family \\\\mathcal{V}(m) of rectangles in R2 such that the ratio of sides stays between m‚àí1 and m, for some fixed m ‚â• 1\\\\. If an arbitrary norm is given on Rn, the family of balls for the metric associated to the norm is another example. The one-dimensional case was proved earlier by . If f is integrable on the real line, the function :F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x f(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t is almost everywhere differentiable, with F'(x) = f(x). Proof The theorem in its stronger form‚Äîthat almost every point is a Lebesgue point of a locally integrable function f‚Äîcan be proved as a consequence of the weak-L1 estimates for the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood maximal function. The proof below follows the standard treatment that can be found in , , and . Since the statement is local in character, f can be assumed to be zero outside some ball of finite radius and hence integrable. It is then sufficient to prove that the set :E_\\\\alpha = \\\\Bigl\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^n :\\\\limsup_{B\\\\rightarrow 0, \\\\, x \\\\in B} \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\bigg\\\\int_B f(y) -f(x)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y\\\\bigg > 2\\\\alpha \\\\Bigr\\\\\\\\} has measure 0 for all Œ± > 0\\\\. Let Œµ > 0 be given. Using the density of continuous functions of compact support in L1(Rn), one can find such a function g satisfying :\\\\f - g\\\\_{L^1} = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^n} f(x) - g(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x < \\\\varepsilon. It is then helpful to rewrite the main difference as : \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_B f(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y - f(x) = \\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_B \\\\bigl(f(y) - g(y)\\\\bigr) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\Bigr) + \\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{1}{B}\\\\int_B g(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y - g(x) \\\\Bigr)+ \\\\bigl(g(x) - f(x)\\\\bigr). The first term can be bounded by the value at x of the maximal function for f ‚àí g, denoted here by (f-g)^*(x): : \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\int_B f(y) - g(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\leq \\\\sup_{r>0} \\\\frac{1}{B_r(x)}\\\\int_{B_r(x)} f(y)-g(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y = (f-g)^*(x). The second term disappears in the limit since g is a continuous function, and the third term is bounded by f(x) ‚àí g(x). For the absolute value of the original difference to be greater than 2Œ± in the limit, at least one of the first or third terms must be greater than Œ± in absolute value. However, the estimate on the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood function says that : \\\\Bigl \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ x : (f-g)^*(x) > \\\\alpha \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\Bigr \\\\leq \\\\frac{A_n}{\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\f - g\\\\_{L^1} < \\\\frac{A_n}{\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\varepsilon, for some constant An depending only upon the dimension n. The Markov inequality (also called Tchebyshev's inequality) says that : \\\\Bigl\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x : f(x) - g(x) > \\\\alpha \\\\right \\\\\\\\}\\\\Bigr \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\f - g\\\\_{L^1} < \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\varepsilon whence : E_\\\\alpha \\\\leq \\\\frac{A_n+1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\varepsilon. Since Œµ was arbitrary, it can be taken to be arbitrarily small, and the theorem follows. Discussion of proof The Vitali covering lemma is vital to the proof of this theorem; its role lies in proving the estimate for the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood maximal function. The theorem also holds if balls are replaced, in the definition of the derivative, by families of sets with diameter tending to zero satisfying the Lebesgue's regularity condition, defined above as family of sets with bounded eccentricity. This follows since the same substitution can be made in the statement of the Vitali covering lemma. Discussion This is an analogue, and a generalization, of the fundamental theorem of calculus, which equates a Riemann integrable function and the derivative of its (indefinite) integral. It is also possible to show a converse ‚Äì that every differentiable function is equal to the integral of its derivative, but this requires a Henstock‚ÄìKurzweil integral in order to be able to integrate an arbitrary derivative. A special case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem is the Lebesgue density theorem, which is equivalent to the differentiation theorem for characteristic functions of measurable sets. The density theorem is usually proved using a simpler method (e.g. see Measure and Category). This theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on Rn instead of Lebesgue measure (a proof can be found in e.g. ). More generally, it is true of any finite Borel measure on a separable metric space such that at least one of the following holds: * the metric space is a Riemannian manifold, * the metric space is a locally compact ultrametric space, * the measure is doubling. A proof of these results can be found in sections 2.8‚Äì2.9 of (Federer 1969).

Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, which were produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons between 1949 and 1964. Several of the shorts, especially the ones produced from 1965 onward, were produced by DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises after Warner Bros. closed their animation studio. DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises provided the animation for the show's intro and closing credits. Background From 1966 to 1968, The Road Runner Show initially ran for two seasons on CBS. From 1968 to 1969, CBS combined The Road Runner Show with The Bugs Bunny Show to produce The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour. The Road Runner and the Coyote more often shared at least an hour with Bugs Bunny on CBS. In 1971, ABC picked up The Road Runner Show and ran for two seasons until 1973, when the network dropped the show due to its excessively aggressive scenes. Later on, CBS re-acquired the show and aired them as reruns under The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour until the mid-80s. Each show would feature one Road Runner/Coyote cartoon, with a Tweety and Sylvester cartoon in the middle segment, and other WB animated character(s) in the third segment (usually Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales, Pepe Le Pew and Hippety Hopper). The intro of every cartoon was replaced with a simple titlecard along with the shortened version of William Lava's arrangement of The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.

In 1999, it was covered by the Mexican band Chicos de Barrio and was later parodied in Histeria! featuring Father Time and Big Fat Baby. It has also been covered by Barenaked Ladies, and Barbara Cameron re-recorded the theme with her son, Jazz violinist Doug Cameron (with Paul Julian's iconic Beep-Beep and other sound effects from the shorts used on the recording) for his Different Hats album in 2008. An instrumental version was used as the theme song for the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote segments of The Looney Tunes Show.

During his coaching career he was head coach of many sports including basketball, track and field and crew, but the majority of for his coaching work was in football. Though mainly known for football, he left his mark on several college athletics departments and other sports. This includes being the first athletic trainer at Ohio State University, the first paid coach of the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team, and the first coach of Syracuse University rowing team. Sweetland attended Union College and was graduate of Cornell University in 1899. A gifted athlete, Sweetland was on the varsity football team at Union and Cornell and the varsity rowing team at Cornell. At Cornell he was coached by Hall of Fame coaches Pop Warner in football and Charles E. Courtney in rowing. Early life and family Sweetland was born to George Sweetland and Hannah Marsh Sweetland on January 10, 1875 in Dryden, New York. He had several brothers and sisters. One of his brothers was Monroe Marsh Sweetland, who founded Delta Chi fraternity while a law student at Cornell University. Another brother, Dr. George James Sweetland, was captain of the Union College football team in 1895 and later the athletic director and head football coach at University of North Dakota.Raymond, Andrew Van Vranken, \\" Union University: Its History, Influence, Characteristics and Equipment,\\" Vol. III (Lewis Publishing Company, New York New York 1907), p. 258 College After attending Union College for one year, Sweetland transferred to Cornell University, where he graduated in 1899 with a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture. At Cornell, he was member of Phi Gamma Delta and the Sphinx Head Society. A talented athlete, Sweetland rowed on the varsity crew team, and played tackle on the football team at Cornell. Sweetland was a considered one of the top players in the early years of Big Red football. The Sun named Sweetland to the second team of the all-time Cornell football team in an article on January 29, 1927. E. R. Sweetland in his Cornell letterman sweater, c. 1898‚Äì99 =Football career= Sweetland began his college football career in 1894. \\"Sweet\\" as he was nicknamed, played guard for Union College along with his brother, George. He transferred to Cornell for the 1895 season where he moved to tackle under coach Marshall Newell and helped the school to a 3‚Äì4‚Äì1 record. That year, Sweetland was part of the line that helped Clint Wyckoff become Cornell's first College Football All-American. The following year, Cornell changed coaches replacing Newell with Joseph Beacham. Sweetland helped the Beacham lead the squad to a record of 5‚Äì3‚Äì1. In 1897, Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner took over as head coach. Sweetland could not play for Warner in the 1897 season. During the offseason he went through surgery and his doctors would not allow him to play. When practice started for the 1898 season, Warner had to replace many starters including the previous year's captain, William McKeever. Sweetland returned to the line in 1898. With Sweetland's help, the team won 10 of their first 11 games, setting up a big game for Cornell against national power Penn in the final game of the season. Sweetland helped Cornell take a 6‚Äì0 lead before halftime. He broke through Penn's line blocking a kick and recovered the ball for a touchdown, but Penn came back and won by a score of 12‚Äì6.Davis, Parke Hill, \\"Football, the American Intercollegiate Game,\\" (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York New York 1911), p. 177 With the Penn loss, the team finished the season 10‚Äì2, outscoring their opponents by a score of 296‚Äì29. After the season, he was named 3rd team All-America by Walter Camp. Sweetland planned to the return for the 1899 football season even though he would be graduating. He planned to start his medical training at Cornell. After the 1898 season he became involved in a controversy between two factions on the future direction of the football program that came to the head with the election of captain for the 1899 season. Originally a three-year starter at left guard, Daniel A. Reed was elected captain over Sweetland for the 1899 season. A very close election caused a rift in the football team. Reed won by a vote of ten to nine. Later Reed resigned as captain and the team elected Sweetland unanimously. The Cornell Athletic Council refused to ratify the election of Sweetland, stating that their decision was \\"in the interest of harmony among the various elements who co-operation is necessary for the success of Cornell athletics.\\" The council statement listed two specific reasons. The first was that the Council wanted to purge all leaders of the competing factional rivalries on the team. This included Coach Warner and Tom Fennell as well as Daniel A. Reed. All three stated they would not return for the 1899 season. The second reason was a large number of football alumni protested the election of Sweetland as captain. Additionally, a charge was leveled that Sweetland was a professional, not an amateur, since he was paid for playing football for Elmira Athletic Club in the fall of 1897. Sweetland denied the allegation only admitting that he received reimbursement for his expenses but not for playing. After the Athletic Council ruling the team elected fullback Raymond Starbuck as team captain. 1899 Cornell Varsity Rowing Team: E. R. Sweetland is third from the left in the middle row =Varsity rower= Sweetland was a member of the varsity crew at Cornell in 1898 and 1899 under Coach Charles E. Courtney. In 1897, as a novice rower, Sweetland went out for Cornell rowing team but did not make varsity. Early on he was mentioned as a possible varsity rower at the no. 5 position. He had to go against more experienced rowers including E. J. Savage who rowed varsity in 1896 and Edgar Johnston, who rowed varsity in 1895. Sweetland had trouble throughout the season. First he was thrown out of his boat when he wrecked his shell upon a snag. He also had to spend several days in the hospital due to trouble with his appendicitis. In 1898 he was a substitute on team that finished second in Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta at Saratoga Lake. The following year, he rowed in the No. 5 position that finished third in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta at Poughkeepsie, New York. In that race, the Cornell crew had the slight advantage holding the outer course but lost to the University of Pennsylvania coached by Ellis Ward. The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison using a modified English stroke started quickly and held a lead at the mile and half marker but lost the lead to Penn due to bad steering. Penn finished strong using a stroke that depended on leg drive over the catch. This gave the boat a slight amount of checking between strokes. Sweetland and the Cornell crew were unable to catch Penn and finished three and a half lengths behind. They were also unable to catch Wisconsin and finished varsity race in third place.Hewett, Waterman Thomas, \\"Cornell University: A History,\\" (The University Publishing Society, New York, USA, 1905), vol 3, p. 196-200, 257-258, College coaching career Sweetland started coaching football the fall after he graduated from Cornell. He would coach college sports for the next twenty years with all but two as a head coach. As a football coach he finished with a record of 100‚Äì41‚Äì10. His coaching career allowed Sweetland earn several advance degrees at the schools he coached, including a Ph.M. in Sociology from Syracuse and LL.B and LL.M from the University of Kentucky.Smalley, p. 258, =Hamilton= After graduation, Sweetland took his first coaching job as the head football coach at Hamilton College in nearby Clinton, New York. In his first season as a head coach, he led the 1899 squad to an 8‚Äì2‚Äì1 record. That year Hamilton played a then school-record 11 games with one of the two losses coming at the hands of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, coached by his former coach Glenn Scobey \\"Pop\\" Warner, and the other loss coming to Sweetland's former school Cornell. He left for Syracuse University after the season. =Syracuse= On January 3, 1900 Sweetland was picked to be the head coach for the Syracuse University football team. A month later, on February 6, 1900, Sweetland agreed to also become Syracuse's rowing coach.Smalley, Frank (editor), \\"Alumni Record and General Catalogue of Syracuse University 1899-1904,\\" (Alumni Association of Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York, USA, 1904), Vol II (supplement) p.15-16 Even though rowing had some history at the university since 1873, including hosting professional crew races on Onondaga Lake, Sweetland became their first Intercollegiate coach. Chancellor James Roscoe Day assisted the rowing team that year by persuading Lyman Cornelius Smith to donate equipment. In Sweetland's first year as coach of the rowing team, he was basically starting the rowing team from scratch. He spent a good amount of time on basic watermanship and maintaining an even keel. He started practice in late March and was able to get the team ready for a race against the Francis Club Crew of Cornell in June.Smalley, p. 457-461 A crowd of 3000 showed up at Onondaga Lake to watch the race in which Sweetland's varsity crew lost by six seconds. Cornell University's Percy Field c. 1905. Sweetland played football on this field as a student at Cornell as well as coached against his former school while coach of Hamilton and Syracuse. In fall of that year, Sweetland began football practice on September 4, 1900 with 10 returning players from the 1899 team.Smalley, p. 20 His team finished the season with a 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 record including victories over Amherst and Oberlin. One of his losses was to his former school, Cornell by a score of 6‚Äì0. Syracuse coming into the game did have several advantages that made their fans optimistic that the Orange could pull out a victory. First the game was being played early in the season, September, 29th. The Orangemen had been practicing for several weeks longer than Cornell. The second benefit was a large crowd of Syracuse rooters attended the game. Even with the game being played at Cornell's Percy Field, Syracuse rooters filled half the grand stand and part of the bleachers. The third advantage was that Cornell's captain, Raymond Starbuck, had been hurt earlier in practice and could not play. Sweetland's team started out strongly and had several opportunities to score. Early in the game, after stopping Cornell on their first possession, Syracuse drove the ball into scoring position at the Cornell's 15 yard line but could not score. Later, just before half time, Cornell returned a fumble to the Syracuse's seven yard line but Sweetland's defence stopped them from scoring and took over on downs. Then in Syracuse's next possession, Carr, Syracuse's half-back, went through a hole in the Cornell line and ran seventy yards before Cornell's halfback A. B. Morrison caught him to prevent a touchdown. The game remained tied until about two minutes to play when Cornell's Morrison ran 25 yards for a touchdown. After the game Cornell accused Coach Sweetland's team of rough and dirty play. Sweetland again coached the rowing team for the 1901 season. The Syracuse crew took part in a regatta on Onondaga Lake on June 7, 1901. Sweetland's varsity eight again raced against the Francis Club crew of Cornell and lost by 1/4 of a boat length. They raced in spite of the fact that Sweetland was in the hospital suffering from an attack of typhoid fever just a few weeks before the race. The season ended with his team rowing in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta in Poughkeepsie, New York. This was the first time in school history that Syracuse attend this event. Sweetland's varsity eight finished fifth out of six teams. Cornell finished first, but the Orangemen were able to beat University of Pennsylvania coached by Ellis Ward. Controversy erupted before the start of the 1901 football season. Cornell refused to play Syracuse because of bad feeling about rough play from the year before. They also questioned the amateur status of the Syracuse team. Syracuse stated that there were rules in force that prevented professional players but admitted that slight violations of the rules were possible. On the issue of rough play the year before, Syracuse investigated and found the accusation to be groundless. The Syracuse General Athletic Committee severed all athletic relations with their upstate New York rivals. The two schools would not play again until 1935. The team finished 7‚Äì1 with including victories over Brown, Columbia and Amherst and outscored their opponent by 150 to 27. The New York Sun rated them the 7th best team in the nation. Sweetland returned for his third year as rowing coach in 1902. Before the season the outlook for Varsity crews at Syracuse looked to be good. Coach Sweetland had experienced rowers to choose the Varsity crew from. Most members of the 1901 Varsity and Freshmen crews returned for 1902. The team returned to Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta. Before the race Syracuse crew weight dropped to an average of less than . Sweetland had to reduce the training before the Regatta. In their second attempt, Syracuse finished fifth out of six teams beating Georgetown in the Varsity race. Cornell finished first followed by Wisconsin, Columbia and Penn. Even though this was the same place they finished the year before it was considered an improvement. The time of 19 minutes 31 seconds was the fastest time at that distance. The 1903 football season under Coach Sweetland saw Syracuse outscore their opponents by a combined score of 153 to 87. The team finished the season with a record of 6‚Äì2‚Äì1. Wins included shutouts against Colgate and Amherst and disappointing lopsided losses to Army and Yale. Before the 1903 rowing season, the Athletic Council replaced Sweetland with James A. Ten Eyck as rowing coach. Sweetland had demanded a higher salary to coach the rowing team. When his demands were not met he resigned from all athletic work at Syracuse. The rowing team threaten a revolt but no major action was taken. Even though they replaced him at rowing coach some in the council tried to retain him as football coach for the 1904 season. They were unsuccessful, with the full council deciding to go in a different direction. In the end Sweetland coached football for three years at Syracuse with a combined record of 20‚Äì5-2. =Return to Hamilton= Sweetland returned to Hamilton to coach the 1903 football team to a 6‚Äì3 record. During that season Hamilton football team ran into financial troubles and was unable to meet the financial offers from other institutions for Sweetland services and he left after the season. In statement released to the alumni, Hamilton stressed Sweetland unselfishness and dedication to the team. The release went on to state that \\"...his conduct on the football field, both in action and speech he was a perfect gentleman, and for this he was heartily admired by faculty and students.\\" =Courtney and Cornell Athletic Council= Charles Courtney, Cornell rowing coach After leaving Hamilton, Sweetland considered an offer to be assistant rowing coach under his former mentor Coach Courtney at Cornell for the 1904 season. Courtney wanted Sweetland to replace F. D. Colson who moved on to become coach at Harvard. While negotiation were still pending, the Rowing Committee of the Cornell Athletic Council announced that they hired C. A. Lueder to the position. This caused a power struggle between Courtney and the Athletic Council for control of the rowing program. The conflict was resolved when the Rowing Committee canceled the job offer to Lueder. In addition, the Athletic Council limited their interference with the rowing team by giving Coach Courtney the power to pick member of the crew and designate the oarsmen position. However, Sweetland did not become Courtney's assistant because in the time it took resolve the conflict, he was offered and accepted the position as head football coach at Ohio State University. With Sweetland out of the picture, Courtney hired Lueder as his assistant rowing coach. =Ohio State= In 1904, Sweetland became the head football at Ohio State University, partly due to a strong recommendation from Walter Camp and beating out Albert Hernstein for the position. Hernstein would later replace him. In his first year, he led the Buckeyes to a 6‚Äì5 record. Of the five losses only one was an Ohio Athletic Conference rival, a close 4‚Äì2 decision to Oberlin. Expectations were high for the 1904 team. The athletic association to purchased 1,500 additional bleacher seats for the east side of University Field, but, the team fell way short of all expectations and the expected crowds never materialized. Even with the disappointing season Sweetland's team did accomplished a first in Ohio State football history. It was the first Buckeye team to cross the goal line against University of Michigan. The touchdown was scored by the Buckeye's when Bill Marquardt returned a fumble fifty yards. The next year, he and the Buckeyes improved to 8‚Äì2‚Äì2. This team did not give up any points in Ohio Athletic Conference games. They did have a 0‚Äì0 tie to Case Institute of Technology. Case won the conference due to the fact they played and won two more games in conference than the Buckeyes. The two losses that season were to future Big Ten Conference rivals University of Michigan (40‚Äì0) and Indiana University (11‚Äì0). Sweetland finished with a combined record of 14‚Äì7‚Äì2 in his two years as the Buckeyes head man. Sweetland also served as trainer of Ohio State's athletic teams and coach of the Buckeye's track and field team starting in 1905 and again in 1906. He was the first \\"Trainer\\" at Ohio State University, filling a role approved by the Athletic Board in January 1904 and which he accepted in December 1904. While track coach, with a victory over Oberlin in a dual meet by a score of 52‚Äì33 the Buckeyes won the state championship for 1905. In the spring of 1906 he was accused of using \\"improper inducements\\" in securing players and was investigated by the University's Athletic Board who publicly exonerated him. =Colgate= After helping Pop Warner at Cornell as an alumni football coach, Sweetland returned to being a head coach in 1907 at Colgate University where he coached the track team. The team was successful in winning both triangular meets they entered including one against nearby rivals Hamilton and Rochester. He was then named head football coach for the 1908 season. Going into the season the team prospects were considered poor. Nine of the top 17 players from the previous season did not return including standouts Milton Proctor, Theodore Sprague, Joseph Kronenburg, and Arthur Clark. The only experience lineman, Evan Boardman, caught pneumonia before the season and missed several practices. The university's athletic department was not able to provide a training table for the team because of lack of funds. Sweetland also had to deal with a tough schedule that included Cornell, Brown, Army and Syracuse. Even with those obstacles Sweetland was able to guide Colgate to a winning record in his only season as the thirteenth coach of the Raiders. After getting shut out in three of the first four games of the season, the Raiders were able to turn the season around with a strong finish. The offense out- scored, Union, Syracuse and Hamilton by 53‚Äì4 in the last three games to secure a winning record. Though Sweetland was able to beat his former employer, Syracuse, he lost to his alma mater, Cornell, by a score of 9‚Äì0. =Kentucky= Sweetland left Colgate and was hired as head football coach at the University of Kentucky (known as Kentucky State University at the time) in the fall of 1909. Kentucky was able to hire him due to a financially successfully 1908 Thanksgiving game versus in-state rival Centre College, This game allowed them to afford \\"eastern\\" coach to lead the football team.Stanly, Gregory Kent, \\"Before Big Blue ‚Äì Sports at the University of Kentucky 1880-1940,\\" (The University Press of Kentucky, 1996), p. 48, . During the 1909 season, the Wildcats scored several notable victories including a 6‚Äì2 over the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. The head of the military department at Kentucky, Commandant Corbusier, stated that the team \\"fought like Wildcats.\\" Shortly after this, \\"Wildcats\\" became synonymous with the university and would eventually become the official nickname. Other victories that year included a shutout victory over the University of Tennessee Volunteers and a blow out of cross-town rival Transylvania College. The team finished the season with a 15‚Äì6 victory over Centre before 6,-000 fans to win the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Association (KIAA) state title.Stanly, p. 49 The Sweetland-led Wildcats finished the year at 9‚Äì1 and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 261 to 29 with the only blemish being a 15‚Äì6 loss to North Carolina A&M.; The gridiron success was more remarkable considering Sweetland became ill during the season and was feared that he could not continue to coach the football team. The local newspaper went so far to report that a replacement was selected. In the fall of 1909, the faculty athletic senate voted to abolish the men's basketball at Kentucky due to a poor record and an overcrowded gym. As a reaction to this, the University of Kentucky students presented the board of trustees with a solution to the overcrowding. The plan was for a wooden floor and new lighting to be installed in the Armory. To address the poor record of the past teams Sweetland was named coach. This made him first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history. Before this time the team only had managers. In his first year, the basketball team finished 4‚Äì8. R. E. Spahr assumed coaching duties during the season when Sweetland once again became ill.Stanly, p. 115-116 Sweetland had recovered from his Illness to coach the 1910 football season. The season went well for the Wildcats as they won the first seven straight victories. Among their victims were the North Carolina, Tennessee and Tulane. The last two games of the season did not go the Wildcats way. Team traveled to St. Louis University in the eighth game and was shut out by a score of 9‚Äì0. Centre College beat Kentucky on Thanksgiving Day in the last game of the season by a score of 12‚Äì6. Sweetland's team had several costly fumbles to allow Centre to claim the State title. This game was marred by several controversies. The first was before the game A. H. Throckmorton of the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Association (KIAA) ruled that several of Centre College players were not eligible to play because their educational background did not meet the minimum requirement set out by the KIAA. Centre played the players that KIAA stated that were ineligible in the game anyway. It did so since both Kentucky and Centre were also members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) who had not ruled on the players' eligibility. The second was due to a verbal argument before the game that escalated to a point that Centre stated it was fearful of UK's actions and also stated it would never play Kentucky again.Stanly, p. 50-51 At the end of the season Sweetland's health once again began to fail. He submitted his resignation and accepted what he hoped would be a \\"less stressful job\\" as the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison rowing coach. By mid January, Sweetland, had to send word to University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Athletic Director George W. Ehler that he will be unable to continue his duties due to his ongoing illness. Edwin R. Sweetland while at Miami University =Miami= After leaving Kentucky, Sweetland wound up as head football coach at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio for the 1911 season. He replaced Harold Iddings, who ended up replacing Sweetland as head basketball coach at UK. After scoring a 46‚Äì0 victory over Wilmington, Miami's offense only scored 11 points and finished the season 2‚Äì4‚Äì2. One of his team's losses was to his former employer, the University of Kentucky by the score of 12‚Äì0. He returned to coach the Wildcats for the 1912 season. He was the last head coach to leave Miami with a losing record until 1989 when Tim Rose's contract was not renewed. =Return to Kentucky= 1911-12 UK Wildcat Basketball Team coached by E. R. SweetlandSweetland returned to the University of Kentucky in 1912 as part of an overall revamping of athletic programs by University President Henry Stites Barker. Barker created a position of Athletic Director to oversee all athletics and physical education. The position had the faculty status of a department chair. Baker hired Sweetland to fill this position, which included that he serve as both head coach of the football and basketball team.Stanly, p. 58-59 The second edition of Sweetland basketball team at Kentucky was more successful than his first. His second stint as head basketball coach went better than his first. The Wildcats posted an undefeated season with a record of 9‚Äì0. Even with the success on the hard court Sweetland's return was marred by several problems and troubles. Sweetland had to deal with disciplinary action by KIAA who had been investigating the use of ineligible athletes. Sweetland announced that Kentucky would leave the KIAA after the end of the academic year. Even with this announcement the KIAA suspended the Wildcats for one year. This caused Sweetland several problems including putting together a schedule for the 1912 football season. Most games had to be filled with schools from outside the state with emphasis put on games with fellow SIAA schools. Rumors that the KIAA had informed the SIAA of its findings plus strong criticism from the faculty council, most notably the dean of the engineering department, Paul Anderson were ongoing issues that Sweetland had to deal with. The 1912 Wildcats posted a 7‚Äì2 record, losing only to Sweetland's former school, Miami University, by a score of 13‚Äì8 and VMI by a score of 3‚Äì2. During the season, Sweetland had to fire his assistant coach Richard S. Webb after he took several team members to a Knoxville Red-light district after the football game versus the University of Tennessee. Near the end of the season a fire broke out in the on-campus office of Athletic Department critic Paul Anderson. The fire caused little damage to the building but destroyed several items in the office. Originally it was reported as an electrical fire but latter changed to arson. This was reinforced by discovery of several items from Anderson's office near the football field. In early December Sweetland, along with six students with ties to the athletic department, were arrested for starting the fire. The warrants for arrest were sworn to by Captain Richard Webb. As well as being a former Kentucky football coach and captain of the 1910 Wildcat football team, Webb was from a prominent Lexington family as well as being an officer of the court. Sweetland and Webb had been close friends and business partners but their friendship had deteriorated.Stanly, p. 66-67 The case took an unexpected turn when the investigation by the State Fire Marshall, Police and District Attorney changed its focus from Sweetland to Richard Webb. Webb hired a prominent legal team which included Henry S. Breckinridge. During the preliminary trial Webb's defense attorneys tried to paint Sweetland mentally unstable and tried to switch suspicion to Sweetland. At the end of the preliminary trail the judge ruled that probable cause existed to hold Webb on the charge of arson. At the trial Webb's defense team dropped the tactic of switching blame to Sweetland. Instead they focused on discrediting the testimony of Thomas Baker who had confessed to a charge of arson and implicated Webb as his accomplice. They also had several family members provide an alibi for Webb and were successful in having the fingerprint evidence thrown out. During final arguments the defense team argued that the prosecution had failed to Webb's motive. In the end the jury only took 45 minutes to reach a not guilty verdict.Stanly, p. 64-72 Early in 1913, before the Webb arson case went to trial, Edwin Sweetland resigned his duties as coach and athletic administrator. The UK athletic department announced that he \\"could not be induced to stay.\\"Stanly, p. 68 As the football coach of the Wildcats, Sweetland compiled a 23‚Äì5 mark in three seasons. =West Virginia= After the second stint at Kentucky, Sweetland moved on to West Virginia University for the 1913 season. After starting the season with two convincing wins over Davis & Elkins College and Waynesburg the Mountaineer stumbled the rest of the way to a 3‚Äì4‚Äì2 record. This did not sit well with West Virginia fans and alumni. \\"When WVU lost to (West Virginia) Wesleyan for the second straight season, 21‚Äì0, outraged alumni called for the hiring of a nationally known coach.\\" The 1914 Tulane University Football team holding a football painted to celebrate their 0‚Äì0 tie with LSU =Tulane= Sweetland left West Virginia and took a job to coach football for the 1914 season at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. Shortly before Sweetland was supposed to leave for New Orleans, he almost reneged of his commitment to coach Tulane. This was due to the slow recovery of a broken ankle caused by a stray foul ball while at a park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Tulane administration successfully persuaded Sweetland that the college needed his coaching experience. In his only year as the head coach for the Green Wave, Sweetland, had a record of 3‚Äì3‚Äì1. The highlight of the season was an 82‚Äì0 victory over Centenary and a 0‚Äì0 tie with archrival LSU in the season finale. In addition to coaching football, Sweetland also coached the basketball and track teams during the 1914-15 academic year. E. R. Sweetland while coach of Tulane =Alfred= After leaving Tulane, Sweetland returned to his native Western New York and spent several seasons in a part-time job as football coach at Alfred University. Under Sweetland leadership Saxons won regularly, posting a 17‚Äì5 record during his four years as coach. He took over the team in 1915 and coached it to a 4‚Äì2 record. The biggest win that season was a 13‚Äì7 victory over nearby Syracuse University's freshman team. After the season, he hired to coach the team the next season as well as being a given a \\"22 savage rifle\\" in appreciation for his success. Before the 1916 Season, Sweetland instituted pre-season practice which helped Alfred achieve one of the \\"most memorable football years.\\"Norwood p. 181 The team finished with a record of 5-1 including two noteworthy victories. The Saxons defeated rival Hobart College for the first time since 1907 and defeated national power Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Sweetland's 1917 squad finished the season with a 3‚Äì0 record that was shortened when two colleges cancelled games. The season included 2‚Äì0 victory over Grove City College on a field described as \\"liquid chocolate glue\\". This was the school's first unbeaten and untied season. In 1918, due to World War I, Alfred campus life was dominated by the Student Army Training Corps. The Corps was designed to provide the military with officers during the War. Alfred did not hire Sweetland to be their football coach, but instead used multiple officers from the Corps.Norwood p. 165 Sweetland however did return for the 1919 season. The Saxons played seven games but only three against other four year colleges. Sweetland was critiqued for the overall play of the team and practice schedule. An open meeting was called in which criticism directed at the coach. During this meeting Sweetland declared that he could no longer coach at Alfred. After coaching After coaching Sweetland became a farmer and lawyer in hometown Dryden, New York. In a draft registration card completed in September 1918, Sweetland listed his residence as Dryden and his occupation as farmer.Draft registration card for Edwin Regur Sweetland. Ancestry.com.

Sweetland also was involved in Dryden, New York and Tompkins County politics. Sweetland was a prominent member of the local Democratic Party. He served his community by holding numerous town offices including serving as member of the local draft board. In 1937 he was named \\"Superintendent of Sheep and Swine\\" of the New York State Fair succeeding E. S. Hill of Freeville, New York. He also served as Supervisor of the Town of Dryden from 1938 to 1944 In his political career he had to overcome being a Democrat in an overwhelming Republican county. The local voter rolls when he was elected Supervisor, shows that Republican outnumbered Democrats by close to a 2.5 to one margin in Tompkins County and a 3 to 1 margin in his hometown of Dryden. Personal life On September 28, 1914, Edwin Sweetland married Hester Donnelly a nurse whom he meet at a West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania while recuperating from a broken leg he suffered at a baseball game when he was hit by a foul ball while working for the Pittsburgh Playground Association. Mrs. Sweetland was born in Armagh, Ireland and emigrated with her family when she was five years old. After secretly being married in a small town in Ohio, the couple spent a short time at Sweetland home in Dryden, New York before heading to New Orleans for his job as head football coach of Tulane University. They returned to Dryden after his only season as Tulane football coach. They had one child named Edwin R. Sweetland Jr. Mrs. Sweetland died in 1930 at Memorial Hospital in Ithaca, New York. Sweetland died on 21 October 1950 at his home in Dryden, New York.

Le Carnival de Lumiere The first evening presentation, Le Carnival de Lumiere, premiered on October 23, 1982. It celebrated world festivals with fountains, film, music, and other effects. The show used rear projection screens on barges floating on the World Showcase Lagoon. Between the projection barges were fountain/fireworks barges controlled by Apple computers. The show could be viewed only from points between the Mexican and Canadian pavilions. A New World Fantasy A New World Fantasy was the 2nd version of a fireworks show at Epcot and was set to classical music played on synthesizer. It opened in the summer of 1983 and used floating barges that had rear projection screens on them. The barges were the same as the first show at Epcot, Carnival de Lumiere. The show also added 'Pichel lights' that moved automatically. * Most of the soundtrack can be found on Don Dorsey's album \\"Busted\\", but the \\"Great Parades and Pageants\\" segment was removed. * The complete soundtrack can be found on a promotional Don Dorsey album. =Show program= Fanfare 1\\\\. \\"Fanfare\\" from La P√©ri :: Paul Dukas Act I: Celebrations on Land 2\\\\.

New music was created for the show's theme by Don Dorsey and Bruce Healey. The \\"Great Parades and Pageants\\" section used in the previous installments was omitted and replaced with a celebration of all the individual countries of World Showcase (except Norway, which had just opened by the show's premiere). This installment of IllumiNations began a radical new use for effects in fireworks shows. To add to the Pichel lights, fountains, laser barges, and laser graphics projected behind the fountains, the directors made the lights representing the different interact with the music and the rest of the show. In another strange turn of events, they decided not to use fireworks until the very end of the second act, and then the third act would show the fireworks off at their best. =Show program= Opening Act I 1\\\\.

Braeburn is a community of subdivisions in southwest Houston, Texas along Brays Bayou west of Hillcroft Avenue and south of the Sharpstown community. The first of these middle class subdivisions was developed after World War II at a time when the Richmond Farm-to-Market Road (later renamed as Bissonnet Street) provided the route into the city, rather than U.S. Highway 59. Development continued into the 1970s. The Braeburn Country Club is located in the center of the community. Subdivisions found here include Robindell, Braeburn Terrace, Braeburn Glen, Larkwood, Braeburn Valley, Bonham Acres, Braes Timbers and--the acreage lot subdivision--Brae Acres. The area also includes commercial and multi-family developments. Braeburn is notable for its large number of mid-century modern homes, tree lined streets, and location close to the Galleria, the Texas Medical Center, Reliant Park, the major freeways- 59, 610 and the Beltway. The communities of Braeburn have in recent years formed the Braeburn Superneighborhood, a coalition of Home Owner Associations, in order to interact more effectively with the City of Houston and other area agencies. The Brays Bayou hike and bike trail runs through the community, providing easy access to over 15 miles of excellent trails. Fire service This neighborhood is served by Fire Station 68 , located on the corner of Bissonnet and Gessner, next to Braeburn Glen Park and Lee LeClear Tennis center.

He Loves Me Not () is a 2002 French psychological drama film directed by L√¶titia Colombani. The film focuses on a Fine Arts student, played by Audrey Tautou, and a married cardiologist, played by Samuel Le Bihan, with whom she is dangerously obsessed. The film studies the condition of erotomania and is both an example of the nonlinear and \\"unreliable narrator\\" forms of storytelling. The title refers to the last two lines of the French game of Effeuiller la Marguerite (Fr., \\"to pluck the daisy\\") of pulling petals off a flower, in which one seeks to determine whether the object of their affection returns that affection and to what extent: un peu (\\"a little\\"), beaucoup (\\"a lot\\"); passionn√©ment (\\"passionately\\"): √† la folie (\\"to madness\\"); pas du tout (\\"not at all\\"). Plot Ang√©lique (Audrey Tautou), a successful art student, purchases a single pink rose at a flower shop to be delivered to her lover, Dr. Lo√Øc Le Garrec (Samuel Le Bihan). In between creating her art projects, Ang√©lique works part-time at a cafe and house-sits for a wealthy vacationing family. Her friend David (Cl√©ment Sibony) disapproves of her affair with Lo√Øc, who is married, but she insists that Lo√Øc will leave his wife for her. When Lo√Øc's wife, Rachel (Isabelle Carr√©), has a miscarriage, the pair separate and Ang√©lique prepares to leave with Lo√Øc on a romantic getaway to Florence. However, Lo√Øc doesn't meet Ang√©lique at the airport, having chosen to mend things with his wife. This throws Ang√©lique into a self-destructive cycle of clinical depression, losing her job and scholarship. While watching the news one night, she learns that Lo√Øc has been arrested for assaulting one of his patients, Sonia Jasmin (Nathalie Krebs). She goes to Sonia's house to convince her to drop the charges and, in the ensuing scuffle, Sonia has a heart attack and dies. Thinking this will win Lo√Øc back, Ang√©lique steals from the house to make it look like a robbery. Instead, Lo√Øc is arrested for Sonia's murder. Ang√©lique, after witnessing Lo√Øc embrace his wife as he is dragged away, returns home, turns on the gas oven, and lies down on the floor to commit suicide. At this point the film rewinds to the opening scene when Ang√©lique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the delivery boy and the subsequent events play out from Lo√Øc's viewpoint. Lo√Øc receives the pink rose and assumes that his wife sent it to him. It is revealed that Lo√Øc barely knows Ang√©lique and that they cross paths only because Ang√©lique is house- sitting for Lo√Øc and Rachel's neighbor. Lo√Øc receives Ang√©lique's gifts and messages but doesn't know who sent them. It is revealed that Rachel's miscarriage was caused by \\"someone\\" running her down with a moped; earlier in the film, Ang√©lique is shown having suffered an \\"accident\\" that ruined her friend's moped and injured her arm. Lo√Øc comes to believe that his stalker is Sonia; he physically attacks her and she presses charges for assault. After she dies of a heart attack, Lo√Øc is arrested as the prime suspect for her murder. After his arrest, Rachel tells the police that he was with her on the night of the death, which clears him of all charges. That night, Lo√Øc sees an ambulance pull up to his neighbor's house after Ang√©lique tries to kill herself. As a doctor, he performs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which causes her to regain consciousness. Now aware of her, he considers the possibility that she is his stalker. Exploring the house that she was house-sitting, he finds a life-sized garbage mosaic of himself. Lo√Øc and Ang√©lique have a final confrontation, in which he declares that they never had, nor ever will have, a relationship. Ang√©lique strikes him over the head with a brass figurine and he falls down the stairs. Ang√©lique is arrested, diagnosed with erotomania, and remanded to a mental institution. Rachel stands by her husband while he recovers from his injuries, and several years later the couple are shown at a house with their young children as Lo√Øc hobbles around with a walker. Five years after the attack, Ang√©lique is released from the mental institution. Her therapist praises her progress and tells her, \\"If you keep taking your medication, you will be fine\\". However, when the cleaning man is clearing Ang√©lique's room, he discovers her pills have been glued to the wall behind the wardrobe in a mosaic of Lo√Øc, thus showing that Ang√©lique has never taken her medication, and is still obsessed with Lo√Øc. The film then ends with a quotation from a real erotomaniac: \\"Though my love is insane, my reason relieves the pain of the heart, telling me to be patient and not lose hope.\\" Production In a 2003 BBC interview, actress Audrey Tautou commented on working with director Laetitia Colombani: \\"I found her very precise. She knew exactly what she wanted. Even though she's very young, she managed to control the whole production. She knew her subject‚Äìthis strange kind of madness‚Äìvery well because she had studied it for a very long time.\\" Reception = Critical response = The film, repeatedly compared by film critics with Am√©lie, received an overall very positive reaction, holding a 73% Fresh (i.e., positive) rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In the United States, Mick LaSalle noted it was the \\"first feature from 26-year-old Laetitia Colombani and represents about as assured a debut as they come. The first smart thing, of many, that Colombani does is cast Audrey Tautou in the lead role. Tautou has made several movies, but in America she is known for only one, Am√©lie, in which she played a wide-eyed innocent. Here she is just as wide-eyed, but if she's innocent it's only by reason of insanity. He Loves Me...He Loves Me Not has its own charms, but part of its wicked kick is that it's the anti-Am√©lie, presenting romantic fixation, not as noble and sweet, but objectively, as something selfish and volatile....[the film is] driven by a shrewd vision and, beneath its cool French surface, a well-placed sense of moral indignation. Tautou could not be better: She's infuriating -- as well as emotionally present every moment onscreen.\\" Richard Schickel called Colombani a \\"terrifically assured filmmaker\\" whose \\"twice-told tale\\" is the \\"basis for an intricately ironic, darkly witty movie with a twist ending that is both utterly surprising and utterly right\\"; in a comparison with Tautou's performance in Am√©lie, the film \\"displays a more dangerous kind of innocence with a charm that shades off into obsessive madness in very gentle, persuasive increments. Mostly, it's because this French film brings a cool, almost Pascalian logic to the messy topic of erotomania.\\" In the United Kingdom, The Independent called it \\"an assured, if slightly too obvious thriller by first-time director Laetitia Colombani\\"; the film's originality in its subject matter, called a \\"welcome change from the offensive 'woman scorned' scenario of so many Fatal Attractions, is lost somewhat in her treatment -- which gives first Angelique's perspective, before rewinding to show Lo√Øc's. But a serious plus is Tautou, whose creepy, disturbing performance proves that the wide-eyed Am√©lie is a young actress with range.\\" The Evening Standard called it an \\"irredeemably bad French film\\" with \\"characters [that] are cartoon representations of good and evil. By the time we work out what's really going on, it's too late: Ang√©lique has earned our hatred and Lo√Øc has shown himself too passive to hold our interest.\\" =Box office= In France, the film had 580,084 entr√©es (tickets sold); by comparison, Tautou's 2001 film Am√©lie, one of France's most successful films at the box office, sold 8,635,307 tickets.Le Fabuleux destin d'Am√©lie Poulain from AlloCin√©. The film, given a limited release to 23 North American movie theaters, grossed $1,011,102 during its theatrical run. The film was a modest success internationally grossing $101,483 in Austria, $13,306 in Czech Republic, $92,473 in Finland, $720,970 in Germany, $116,274 in Hong Kong, $60,825 in Hungary, $42,151 in Poland, $25,354 in Taiwan, and $140,124 in Turkey, for a worldwide total of $5,126,264.

Aggregate income is a form of GDP that is equal to Consumption expenditure plus net profits. 'Aggregate income' in economics is a broad conceptual term. It may express the proceeds from total output in the economy for producers of that output. There are a number of ways to measure aggregate income, but GDP is one of the best known and most widely used. Measurement using GDP GDP stands for gross domestic product. GDP is a measure of the economic output of a country. It is usually defined as the total market value of goods and services produced within a given period after deducting the cost of goods and services used up in the process of production, but before allowances for depreciation. Most countries compile estimates of their GDP based on guidelines from the United Nations. GDP (Y) is the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (X ‚Äì M). Y = C + I + G + (X ‚àí M) Here is a description of each GDP component: C (consumption) is normally the largest GDP component in the economy, consisting of private (household final consumption expenditure) in the economy. These personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: durable goods, non-durable goods, and services. Examples include food, rent, jewelry, gasoline, and medical expenses but does not include the purchase of new housing. I (investment) includes, for instance, business investment in equipment, but does not include exchanges of existing assets. Examples include construction of a new mine, purchase of software, or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by households (not government) on new houses is also included in investment. In contrast to its colloquial meaning, \\"investment\\" in GDP does not mean purchases of financial products. Buying financial products is classed as 'saving', as opposed to investment. This avoids double-counting: if one buys shares in a company, and the company uses the money received to buy plant, equipment, etc., the amount will be counted toward GDP when the company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products. Buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds, a transfer of claims on future production, not directly an expenditure on products. G (government spending) is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits. X (exports) represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption, therefore exports are added. M (imports) represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms G, I, or C, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic. Components There are a number of different variables that go into determining aggregate income. Those variables include: Employee income: Combined incomes of all employees in a nation before any taxes are taken from that income. Business owner income: Income that is earned by business owners through the operation of their businesses. Rental income: Income that is earned by real estate owners who charge rent for the use of their properties. Corporate income: Income that is earned by corporations. Interest income: Income that is earned through the payment of interest on invested funds. Government income: Income earned by the government of a country. Government subsidies: Money that the government pays to employees, business owners, real estate owners, corporations and interest earners. Calculation Aggregate income is gross income, and the term generally refers to the combined incomes of a couple filing a joint tax return. It includes income from all sources. Now that we know which variables are needed to determine aggregate income, we will look at the formula for its calculation. First, let's assign some abbreviations to the variables that were discussed. E = Employee income B = Business owner income R = Rental income C = Corporate income I = Interest income G = Government income S = Government subsidies The formula to determine aggregate income is as follows: Aggregate Income = E + B + R + C + I + ( G - S ) Notice that government subsidies are subtracted from government income before all of the sum of the other factors is determined. Advantages For households, determining the amount of aggregate income generated over the course of a calendar year can be advantageous when calculating the total taxes due for that period. In a number of nations, federal tax agencies provide some incentives for spouses to file joint tax returns, rather than each spouse filing separately. By choosing to aggregate their generated income for the tax period, the household is likely to owe fewer taxes and thus receive a higher joint return than they would have received with individual returns. Businesses can also benefit from the aggregate income model when calculating expenses of various types. This is especially true when planning budgets for various departments. Along with identifying the individual salaries and wages of current employees, the department can also incorporate resources into the budget plan that allow for granting cost of living increases, merit increases, and possibly adding additional personnel during the budget period. Considering the aggregate income projected for the upcoming operational year allows the business to plan in a manner that ensures it is possible to maintain the right balance in the workforce, while still remaining within budget. Aggregate income is also important to the calculation of the Gross Domestic Product or GDP of a country. Generally, this figure is calculated without allowing for income from taxes or adjusting the figures for inflation that occurs during the period under consideration. Calculating the cumulative income of all the entities involved makes it easier to identify true GDP with more accuracy, and thus allow lawmakers to be in a better position to enact legislation that will help make it easier to reach and maintain a balanced budget. The key function of aggregate income is for the specified group to accurately understand how much income is generated during the identified period of time. This in turn creates the basis for identifying ways to make use of that income so that the highest degree of satisfaction is realized from the efforts used to generate that income. This simple principle of distribution economics helps to create sound financial bases that prepare the group for the future, and make it possible to obtain goals that would have been difficult to achieve if the approach were to consider individual incomes only.

The ship also has a 360-degree azimuth Tees White Gill water jet bow thruster driven by a separate 1,100 hp DC motor. Controls are installed to integrate the z-drives and bow thruster into a dynamic positioning system. Engineers can select fuel-efficient combinations of generators to power the ship whether she is towing an instrument at 1 knot, transiting at 15 knots, or anywhere in between. Her fuel tanks can hold up to giving her an unrefueled range of 12,000 miles at 15 knots. Thomas G. Thompson normally sails with 21 civilian officers and crew, 2 marine technicians, and up to 36 scientists. The crew is unionized, represented by the Inland Boatmen's Union of the Pacific. To support her research activities she has 4,000 square feet of wet and dry laboratory space, multi-beam mapping sonar and other sensors, and a number of cranes and winches to lower and tow various instruments. The A-frame on her stern, the largest crane aboard, is rated for a 15-ton static load. The University of Washington won the right to operate Thomas G. Thompson through a competitive bidding process. Invitations to bid were issued on June 5, 1987. Among the qualifications for bidders specified by the Office of Naval Research was the return of an earlier generation AGOR-3 class oceanographic vessel that the Navy could retire when the new ship was delivered. As a practical matter, this limited bidding to the University of Washington, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University. The Office of Naval Research announced in November 1987 that it had selected the University of Washington to operate the then unnamed AGOR-23. Contacts were signed with the Navy in June 1988. The ship is named for Thomas Gordon Thompson, who founded the University of Washington's Oceanographic Laboratories in 1930. The ship is designated by the Navy as an AGOR or \\"Auxiliary General-purpose Oceanographic Research\\" ship. She is the second research vessel named after Dr. Thompson. The first, USNS Thomas G. Thompson (T-AGOR-9), also operated by the University of Washington, was launched in 1963.  Operating history  RV Thomas G. Thompson in 2018 after her mid-life renovation Thomas G. Thompson is designed for long-endurance research missions in deep ocean waters. She typically spends 260 to 300 days a year at sea. While she has sailed around the Earth on almost every sea and ocean, she has spent the bulk of her career in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Her hull is not ice-strengthened, so she does not operate where sea ice is present. While her civilian crew is assigned to the ship permanently, her scientists rotate aboard in support of specific research programs. These have been quite varied, and include global warming, hydrothermal vents, neutrino detection, mapping ocean currents and seamounts, abyssal phytoplankton, unnderwater volcanic eruptions, algal blooms, and monsoons in the Indian Ocean, among many others. The vessel also serves as an educational platform for science students of all types from elementary to graduate levels. The University of Washington funds 45 days of ship time for its own students each year. In 2004 this cost just over $1 million . Thomas G. Thompson's expected service life was 30 years, which would have seen her retired in 2021. Instead, on October 16, 2014, the University of Washington issued a request for proposals for a mid-life refit of the ship. The contract was awarded to the Vigor Industrial shipyard in Seattle. Her renovation began in June 2016. The project ultimately cost $52 million, jointly funded by the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and the University of Washington. The work is expected to extend the vessel's life by 10 to 15 years. Her propulsion system was largely replaced with new diesel generators, overhauled propulsion motors, and new switchboards, control systems, and alarms. Miles of electrical cable and pipe was replaced as well as the air- conditioning, refrigeration, sewage, and freshwater systems. New research and navigation instruments were also added. The project was completed in December 2017. References University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research vessels Thomas G.

The population was 1,190 at the 2010 census. Seeking platinum by hydraulic mining in the early days of Happy Camp The town of Happy Camp \\"The Heart of the Klamath\\" is located on State Route 96, about west of Interstate 5 and northeast of Willow Creek. The town of O'Brien, Oregon is accessible from Happy Camp (which is nearly away). The shortest route to Oregon, over the Grey Back pass, is a seasonal summer road and is not cleared or maintained in snowy conditions. The Forest Service, located in Happy Camp on SR 96, provides road closure information. Name Happy Camp was so named by miners in the early days of prosperity. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. H.C. Chester, who interviewed Jack Titus in 1882‚Äì83, states that Titus named the camp because his partner James Camp, upon arriving there, exclaimed, \\"This is the happiest day in my life.\\" Redick McKee mentions the camp on November 8, 1851, as \\"Mr Roache's Happy Camp\\" at the place known as Murderer's Bar. (Indian Report 1853:178) Geography Happy Camp sits on the Klamath River and a nexus of creeks including Elk Creek, Little Grider Creek, Indian Creek, Doolittle Creek, Ikes Creek, Deer Lick Creek and Cade Creek. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of , of it is land and of it (1.94%) is water. The town of Happy Camp is also known as the \\"Gateway to the Marbles\\". There are many trail heads for this Wilderness Area within of the town for which the U.S. Forest Service provides trail information. The Marble Mountains cover thousands of acres, and contain almost a hundred lakes. Among the most interesting lakes are Spirit Lake, which contains a luminescent chemical and has been seen to \\"glow\\" in the dark; Ukonom Lake, which is very large and beautiful even though the area is recovering from fire damage; and the Green and Blue Granite Lakes, where trout swim in the cold and clear waters. Deer, bear, elk, and mountain lion are common in the Wilderness Area. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that Happy Camp had a population of 1,190. The population density was 96.4 people per square mile (37.2/km2). The racial makeup of Happy Camp was 814 (68.4%) White, 2 (0.2%) African American, 277 (23.3%) Native American, 7 (0.6%) Asian, 1 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 18 (1.5%) from other races, and 71 (6.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 95 persons (8.0%). The Census reported that 1,190 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized. There were 525 households, out of which 129 (24.6%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 208 (39.6%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 63 (12.0%) had a female householder with no husband present, 26 (5.0%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 63 (12.0%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 5 (1.0%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 175 households (33.3%) were made up of individuals, and 67 (12.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27. There were 297 families (56.6% of all households); the average family size was 2.84.

The homeowner vacancy rate was 3.4%; the rental vacancy rate was 8.0%. 677 people (56.9% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 513 people (43.1%) lived in rental housing units. The community is the home of the Bigfoot Jamboree, an annual festival put on by the Happy Camp Community Council. Happy Camp is along the \\"Bigfoot Scenic Byway,\\" an 89-mile stretch of California State Route 96 named by the United States Forest Service. The town is the home of an 18-foot-tall Bigfoot statue made out of recycled metal. Climate As is typical of California, Happy Camp has a mediterranean climate. It is marked by very hot summer days, being shielded in the valley behind the mountains from the cooling Pacific influence affecting nearby coastal locations. The winters are much cooler and snowier than in inland locations further south, albeit still very mild compared to areas to the east of the continent. The dry and hot summers make the surrounding forest prone to wildfires, as seen during the 2014 Happy Camp Complex Fire, which took months to extinguish and burned nearly to the Oregon border. The high winter rainfall, however, keeps the area greener than its summer climate would suggest. Average lows remain cool year- round, relieving the intense daytime heat and keeping the average July temperature at around , in sharp contrast to the average highs.

She served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 1993 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. She was previously a municipal politician in North York, and campaigned for mayor of the city in 1985. She is a Red Tory, and holds progressive views on most social issues. Early life and career Greene was born in Pembroke in eastern Ontario, where her father was stationed during World War II. Her parents were Alfred Greene and Mary Margaret Greene (n√©e Hutchinson) of Toronto. Both were graduates of St. Michael's College, University of Toronto. Her parents returned to Toronto following the war, and she attended St. Monica's Separate School in North Toronto. She graduated from St Michael's College, University of Toronto in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and from the College of Education in 1967 with qualifications in English and Theatre Arts. She taught English at Victoria Park Secondary School for the North York Board of Education from September 1967 until she was elected to office in 1971. Municipal politician =North York City Controller, 1972-1980= Greene was first elected to the North York Council in December 1972, winning a position on the city's Board of Control, the first woman elected to the body. Her position on the Board of Control gave her an automatic seat on the Metropolitan Toronto Council. Greene's first campaign was centred primarily around a zoning issue: she opposed a municipal bylaw restricting cohabitation by people unless they were related or one person was an owner (she and her female housemates had been threatened with eviction under the terms of this bylaw). Greene also argued that she would speak for the rights of women, single persons, tenants and salaried workers.Barbara Greene, \\"Civic election\\" (Letter to the editor), Globe and Mail, 2 December 1972, p. 6. One of the first issues she was involved in was the Ambulance service. She fought a \\"one woman war\\" which resulted in the amalgamation of ambulances services in Metropolitan Toronto and the establishment of the Toronto Ambulance Service. She was re-elected to the Board of Control in 1974, 1976 and 1978 before standing down in 1980. As a result of topping the poll for the Board of Control (on which sat the Mayor and four Controllers elected at-large), Greene became the Deputy Mayor of North York in 1974. In this capacity she sat on the Executive Committee and Budget sub committee of Metropolitan Toronto and reviewed the budgets of numerous departments at various times including those of the Community Services and Housing departments, the Police and the Ambulance Departments. She also ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1975 provincial election, losing to New Democrat Odoardo Di Santo in Downsview. Greene's support for cohabitation law reform placed her in opposition to North York Mayor Mel Lastman, who initially supported her but then attempted to exclude boarding houses from the city. Following an eight-year legal battle conducted by lawyer Barry Swadron QC, on behalf of Doug Bell, a resident of North York who had been charged with living with other people to whom he was not related, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld Greene's position and struck down the municipal bylaw in April 1979.\\"Bylaw limiting home to family is struck down\\", Globe and Mail, 25 April 1979, P4. Greene favoured market-value assessment reforms for Metro Toronto properties, and criticized provincial Treasurer Darcy McKeough for backing away from this proposal in 1978.\\"Politicians' reactions to the shelving of taxation reform range from jubilation to disgust and disappointment\\", Globe and Mail, 9 June 1978, P4. In 1979, she spoke out against tobacco advertising on the Toronto Transit Commission.Dick Beddoes, \\"Smoking out cigaret ads\\", Globe and Mail, 16 May 1979, P8. She also supported electoral reforms, including the abolition of regional Boards of Control and the direct election of the Metro Chair.James Jefferson, \\"Politicians hail plan for direct election to Metro\\", Globe and Mail, 29 April 1978, P1; Alden Baker, \\"Paul Godfrey: lots of power, no election expenses\\", Globe and Mail, 9 October 1980, P5. She considered running against Lastman for Mayor of North York in 1980, but declined on the grounds that she did not have the financial resources to conduct a successful campaign.Dick Beddoes, \\"Very stable sort, those Islanders\\", Globe and Mail, 15 July 1980, P8. She did not seek re-election to the Board of Control, and instead announced that she would enrol in a Master of Public Administration (postgraduate) program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.\\"Controller Greene heads for Harvard\\", Globe and Mail, 1 August 1980, P5. Greene sought a prominent civil service position after returning to Toronto, but was unsuccessful and returned to teaching high-school English.John Haslett Cuff, \\"The Greeneing of North York isn't over yet\\", Globe and Mail, 15 May 1982, F6. =North York City Controller, 1982-1985= Greene returned to municipal politics in 1982, winning election to the second position on North York's Board of Control and receiving an automatic position on Metro's executive committee.\\"Greene bid shakes North York\\", Globe and Mail, 2 November 1982, P4. She argued for cutbacks to the Toronto Transit Commission's budget, arguing that it had become \\"out of control\\" by 1984.Geoffrey York, \\"Large increase in TTC's budget leads to review\\", Globe and Mail, 25 January 1984, P5. Greene supported the direct election of Metro Councillors, on the grounds that indirectly elected council members were not sufficiently accountable.Paul McGrath, \\"The divine right of Godfrey\\", Globe and Mail, 7 January 1984, CL2. She resumed her previous role as a prominent critic of Mel Lastman, arguing that his style of politics favoured backroom deals and often removed councillors from the decision-making process.Bryan Johnson, \\"Bad Boy Mel: The fridge huckster who stole the hearts of North York voters\\", Globe and Mail, 2 April 1983, P10. Greene also called for the resignation of city planning commissioner Bruce Davidson in August 1983, arguing that his $265,000 debt to a major developer created a serious conflict-of-interest situation.\\"Planner should be fired North York controller says\\", Globe and Mail, 30 August 1983, P4. She was one of only four councillors to oppose significant cutbacks to North York's public health department in June 1984, and was subsequently the only City Controller to support an affirmative action program for city.John Sewell, \\"June bugs, dog days\\", Globe and Mail, 2 July 1984, M1; Dyanne Rivers, \\"Controllers wary of affirmative action\\", Globe and Mail, 27 September 1984, M5. Greene accused North York Councillor Andrew Borins of improper behaviour in 1983-84, arguing that his family's property holdings put him in an undeclared conflict of interest over the proposed North York Civic Centre.John Sewell, \\"Politicians in conflict\\", Globe and Mail, 8 March 1984, M1. Borins sued Greene for slander and Greene responded by charging Borins with Conflict of Interest. Borins was successful in the lower courts on 20 March 1984, but this decision was overturned on appeal. A Divisional Court judge subsequently upheld Greene's accusation, and stripped Borins of his council seat on 16 April 1985.\\"Alderman absolved of conflict of interest\\", Globe and Mail, 21 March 1984, M1; Geoffrey York, \\"North York alderman removed from office\\", 17 April 1985, M1; Geoffrey York, \\"Libel lawsuit against controller sparked alderman's downfall\\", Globe and Mail, 18 April 1985, M1. She was offered the Progressive Conservative Party's nomination for Eglinton‚ÄîLawrence in the 1984 federal election, but declined.Alden Baker, \\"Ottawa, Queen's Park beckon Metro politicians seek higher ground\\", Globe and Mail, 30 December 1983, P4. Greene challenged Mel Lastman for Mayor of North York in 1985, promising a more open government and arguing that Lastman had \\"den[ied] North York residents the right to participate in planning their neighborhoods\\".Dyanne Rivers, \\"Lastman faces 1st fight in 9 years Greene to run for North York mayor\\", Globe and Mail, 4 September 1985, P18. She was defeated by a significant margin, in a contest marked by undisguised animosity between the candidates. Greene returned to teaching after the election, teaching Media Studies, English and Dramatic Arts with the North York Board of Education.Alden Baker, \\"Politicians split on severance pay\\", Globe and Mail, 18 January 1986, A16; David Miller, \\"Celebrity Job-seekers\\", Toronto Star, 2 February 1986, D1. Member of Parliament Greene returned to political life again in 1988, narrowly winning the federal Progressive Conservative nomination for Don Valley North over Peter Ayre Phillips.Rosemary Todd, \\"Greene gets Tory nod in tight Don Valley race\\", Globe and Mail, 4 August 1988, C8. Greene won the nomination by 147 votes to 130. She subsequently won the riding in the 1988 federal election, defeating Liberal Sarkis Assadourian by a close margin. (Concert pianist Anton Kuerti finished third for the New Democratic Party.) There was some media speculation that Greene would be appointed to cabinet, but she instead served in parliament as a backbench supporter of Brian Mulroney's government.John Cruickshank, \\"MacDonald's defeat opens spot on cabinet\\", Globe and Mail, 22 November 1988, C1. Greene encouraged the Progressive Conservative government to change a section of the Immigration Act in 1989, saying that it discriminated against disabled people.Julia Nunes, \\"MP says Ottawa likely to alter act to remove bias against disabled\\", Globe and Mail, 21 June 1989, A3. She also argued that Canadian copyright laws should be adjusted to permit teachers to copy and reproduce material for classroom analysis.Licia Corbella, \\"Scarborough board leads fight against copyright law\\", Toronto Star, 7 September 1989, N9. In late November 1989, she was appointed to a parliamentary task force examining Canada's abortion laws.David Vienneau, \\"Task force of MPs named on abortion\\", Toronto Star, 23 November 1989, A1. Greene protested against her own government's cutbacks to multicultural organizations in 1990.Val Sears, \\"Coalition in battle to regain funds for heritage languages\\", Toronto Star, 30 March 1990, A13. She chaired the parliamentary standing committee on Health, Welfare, Social Affairs, Seniors and Status of Women and two subcommittees on Child Poverty and the Status of women.David Vienneau, \\"18,000 Metro children go hungry, MPs told\\", Toronto Star, 7 February 1991, A6; David Vienneau, \\"Ottawa urged to take the lead in battle against abuse of women\\", Toronto Star, 13 February 1991, A11; David Vienneau, \\"Probe on violence toward women blocked\\", Toronto Star, 9 June 1991, A4. Her committee's report on violence, entitled \\"The War Against Women\\", was supported by the prime minister and opposition parties, but opposed by some Progressive Conservative backbenchers on the grounds that its title was \\"confrontational and inflammatory\\".David Vienneau, \\"PM criticizes Tories against violence study\\", Toronto Star, 20 June 1991, A3. This subsequently resulted in a significant program to combat violence against women which included funds for women's shelters and education programs for police. Greene supported stricter firearms controls, and announced plans to introduce a bill creating a national firearms registry in late 1991. The initiative was opposed by many in her party.Gord McIntosh, \\"Ottawa's record attacked regarding women's issues\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 8 March 1991, A12; Geoffrey York, \\"Campaign launched for gun registration\\", Globe and Mail, 16 December 1991, A6. She also supported changing Canadian laws to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation\\"Tories split on gay rights\\", Globe and Mail, 18 April 1992, A1. In April 1991, Greene called for existing tax and social benefits to be rolled into a single national child support program targeted to benefit low-income Canadians.Rosemary Speirs, \\"See related story by Robin Harvey on the same page\\", Toronto Star, 14 April 2002, A1. Greene argued that existing benefits favoured wealthier families over the poor, and that the balance needed to be changed. Critics expressed concern that the proposed changes would threaten the universality of these programs, and reduce benefits for vulnerable middle-income families.Geoffrey York, \\"New deal for low-income families expected next week\\", Globe and Mail, 7 May 1991, A1. Clyde Graham, \\"Ottawa ponders income scheme\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 22 February 1991, A1. The Mulroney government implemented the child tax credit program but did not implement the recommendations in the report for a national day care program which it had initially supported.Geoffrey York, \\"Government scraps day-care commitment\\", Globe and Mail, 27 February 1992, A1. Greene tried to convince her government to re-establish the program later in the year, without success.Geoffrey York, \\"Tory tries to revive day-care plan\\", Globe and Mail, 17 October 1992, A11. Greene also sought to create a national standard for social assistance to eliminate the wide disparities between the provinces.Geoffrey York, \\"Guaranteed income under study\\", Globe and Mail, 29 October 1992, A7. Greene called for an adequate income and programs to assist social assistance recipients to become independent as an alternative to food banks, which she argued were creating an unwanted culture of dependence. Gerard Kennedy, the director of Toronto's Daily Bread Food Bank, said that her comments reflected a \\"superficial analysis\\" of hunger issues in Canada. Greene did not call for food banks to be shut down, despite some reports to the contrary.Michael Valpy, \\"Odd timing for a call to shut down food banks\\", Globe and Mail, 15 December 1992, A2; Lila Sarick, \\"Food bank bins placed in stores\\", Globe and Mail, 15 December 1992, A9. Greene also argued that poverty had become a poorly defined concept in Canada, as the Low Income Cut Offs used to determine poverty levels in Canada did not include other subsidies. She argued that many people listed as being below the poverty line in Canada were not actually poor, while some of the real poor were not being assisted. She was quoted as saying, \\"Some of our poor may be the most well-off poor in the world. Our poor have their own apartments and televisions.\\" Several opposition MPs and social agencies criticized Greene's comments, arguing that she was misrepresenting the issue.Geoffrey York, \\"MPs try to move the poverty line\\", Globe and Mail, 24 February 1993, A1; Geoffrey York, \\"UN body chastises Canada on poverty\\", Globe and Mail, 29 May 1993, A1; Ruth Reichrob, \\"Harvest boycotts attempt to redefine poverty line\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 1993. Greene argued that breast cancer was becoming a problem of epidemic proportions in 1992, and argued that the federal Department of Health had become too dependent on information from drug manufacturers in regulating its treatment. She supported the creation of a new arms-length agency to approve drugs and other biomedical products.John Flanders, \\"Health minister caught in a squeeze on women's health issues\\", Hamilton Spectator, 27 June 1992, C10. Her committee report on breast cancer resulted in a $50 million research funding program for which she received a national award from the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation in 1992. Greene supported Kim Campbell's 1993 bid to succeed Mulroney as Progressive Conservative leader and prime minister, arguing that Campbell's ideology was fiscally conservative and socially liberal.\\"Mazankowski, Bouchard should team up, Tory MPs say\\", Kitchener- Waterloo Record, 27 February 1993, E12. After Campbell's victory at the 1993 Progressive Conservative leadership convention, there was renewed speculation that Greene would be appointed to cabinet.Alan Toulin, \\"Reducing cabinet complex juggling act\\", Financial Post, 23 June 1993, p. 4. She was not, although she was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the President of the Treasury Board on 1 September 1993. The Progressive Conservatives were resoundingly defeated in the 1993 federal election, and Greene lost to Liberal candidate Sarkis Assadourian by a significant margin in a rematch from 1988. After 1993 Greene returned to her teaching career after leaving federal politics.Caroline Mallan, \\"The son, the veteran and the pilot\\", Toronto Star, 19 August 1999, A21. She attempted a political comeback as a provincial Progressive Conservative candidate in a 1997 by-election, but was defeated by Liberal David Caplan in the North York riding of Oriole. Personal life Greene has one daughter. Greene's pregnancy in 1978 received significant media attention not only because of the novelty, at the time, of being a pregnant female politician but because she was unmarried and declined to name the father. She is likely the first unmarried Canadian politician to give birth while in office. References External links * 1945 births Women members of the House of Commons of Canada John F.

His brother was the poet and statesman Publius Pomponius Secundus,Josephus, Bellum Juda√Øcum, pp. 170 ff. and their half-sister, Milonia Caesonia, was the second wife of the emperor Caligula.  Life  Pomponius' father is not known with certainty; the scholar Ronald Syme suggested that he might have been either Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, consul suffectus in AD 16, or his brother, Lucius Pomponius Flaccus, consul ordinarius in the following year.Syme, \\"Domitius Corbulo\\", p. 31. Pomponius' mother, Vistilia, was known for having borne seven children to six different men; of these only Quintus and Publius Pomponius shared the same father.Pliny the Elder, vii. 39. During the reign of Tiberius, the Pomponii were caught up in the political intrigues surrounding the downfall of Sejanus, a close advisor of the emperor, who was suspected of plotting to make himself the master of Rome in the emperor's absence. His downfall occurred during his consulship, in October of AD 31, when he had effective control of the government. One of his associates, a man named Aelius Gallus, fled to the house of Publius Pomponius, in the hope that his friend could protect him. On the basis of this friendship, Pomponius was one of those accused by Considius Proculus, a former praetor, of plotting revolution. Publius was placed under house arrest, and his brother, Quintus, gave surety on his behalf.Tacitus, Annales, v. 8. In AD 33, Considius was indicted for treason, taken from his home in the middle of his birthday celebrations, and executed. Quintus Pomponius brought an accusation against Considius' sister, Sancia, who was herself interdicted from fire and water. Pomponius asserted that his accusation was motivated by a desire to obtain the emperor's favor and ensure the safety of his brother, Publius, who nonetheless remained confined until the death of Tiberius four years later.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 18. In 41, Caligula, who had entered the consulship with Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus, resigned after the first week in January, appointing Pomponius consul suffectus. A scant two weeks later, the emperor was assassinated, along with his wife, Milonia Caesonia, Pomponius' half-sister, and various members of the imperial household. Pomponius, whom Cassius Dio describes as a sycophant of the emperor, managed to evade death at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caligula\\", 17.Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus, Roman History, 26, 29. He remained in office with Saturninus, probably until the Kalends of July; the two are still attested in office as of June 25, but two other pairs of consuls are known from the latter months of the year. The following year, Publius Suillius Rufus, a notorious delator, and a half-brother of the Pomponii, accused Marcus Furius Camillus Scribonianus and his mother, Junia, of having consulted astrologers to determine the time of the emperor's death. They were exiled, and in response, their father, Marcus Furius Camillus, the consul of AD 32, and then governor of Dalmatia, took up arms against Claudius. Quintus Pomponius, the target of relentless prosecution by Suillius, joined their revolt, which was crushed after only five days. Camillus was permitted to live in exile for some years; Pomponius' fate is unknown, although he suffered damnatio memoriae;For example, . meanwhile his brother Publius remained in the emperor's favor.Tacitus, Annales, xii. 52; xiii. 43.

Though the show is mostly comedy based, it includes certain segments of more serious (and more important) things, including interviews with politicians and authors. Chaz & AJ recently won the 2016 NAB Marconi Award for Medium Market Personality of the year, a highly distinguished honor in the radio community. The show has won the New Haven Advocate award for best local radio show every single year for the past ten year. The show is done primarily by Chaz and AJ (who don't use their last names to protect their privacy when they aren't working), Ashley, and current show producer Phil. Ashley does traffic, and Phil handles all duties regarding the overall production for the show. Former regular participants included Megan, who did the traffic and news, but also took part in many segments; John, the former show producer; Billy Winn, who was laid off March 2009.

History WOPI-FM, sister to 1490 WOPI, signed on Christmas Day 1946 from atop Whitetop Mountain, a facility described at the time as \\"the largest frequency modulation station in the South\\". After 10 days using a temporary antenna, the station went on air with its regular 10 kW power on January 4, 1947. Building on Whitetop, Virginia's second-tallest mountain, meant bringing power lines six miles to the site and constructing a tower in high winds. When winter weather set in, as it did that February, staff were marooned atop the mountain. WOPI-FM simulcast most of WOPI's NBC and local output and had exclusive coverage of many sporting events. In 1951, WOPI-FM moved off the mountain and to the AM transmitter tower off Old Abingdon Road in Bristol, Virginia. The temporary facility was replaced by a new site in 1954 on the edge of town. Along with WOPI AM, WOPI-FM was sold to W. A. Wilson in 1954, the Pioneer Broadcasting Company in 1959, and the Tri- Cities Broadcasting Company in 1965. The station was sold twice to different radio partners. In 1972, the Highland Development Corporation of Bristol, owners of 1550 WKYE, acquired 96.9 and renamed it WKYE-FM. The station became WFHG-FM in 1975 upon acquisition by the Bristol Broadcasting Company and adopted its present WXBQ-FM call letters in 1978. The call letters were chosen randomly but to avoid confusion with the AM outlet; by this time, WXBQ-FM had already gone country.

As a Technical Consultant, Irvine worked on shows such as The Sky at Night, Tomorrow's World and, most recently, Robot Wars, on which he was hired as a technical consultant in 1998. As a Visual Effects Designer, Irvine worked on shows such as Rentaghost, Terry and June, Blake's 7, The Tripods, Edge of Darkness and To the Manor Born. He is perhaps best known for his work on Doctor Who, for which he was a Visual Effects Designer, from the 1970s to the 1980s. He is credited with building the first K-9 prop for the serial The Invisible Enemy (1977). He was not told that it would be required beyond that story, thus the prop he designed was only capable of traversing the studio floor and proved useless when brought on location for subsequent stories. Irvine eventually built a second K-9 that could cover rougher ground. He occasionally operated the K-9 prop during filming. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he made regular appearances in the BBC children's TV shows Swap Shop and Saturday Superstore, initially to discuss special effects on BBC drama series, and later as a more general expert on science and space issues. His connection with K-9 has continued. In 1981, Irvine served as Visual Effects Designer for the Doctor Who spin-off K-9 and Company. In 1993, he operated K-9 for the Doctor Who charity special Dimensions in Time. In 1999, he once again operated the robotic dog when a model K-9 (in reality one of the original props) was given to the character Vince as a birthday present in Queer as Folk.

United States Customs brokers in the United States prepare and submit documentation to notify or obtain clearance from government agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. They also arrange the transhipment (i.e., local delivery) of merchandise via trucking companies. Many customs brokers specialize in certain goods like apparel, perishables, or clearing the crew and manifest of large cargo vessels. Most are located at major airports and harbors with international traffic.US Customs, Importers - Who needs a Customs Broker to help clear goods through CBP However, with the advent of the Automated Broker Interface and rules allowing customs brokers to be permitted nationally (as opposed to specific ports), customs brokers no longer need to be located near a port. =Qualifications= US Customs broker licenses are issued and overseen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The requirements governing US Customs broker licenses, including eligibility, are laid out in Title 19, Part 111 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 111). These regulations permit both individuals and companies to obtain Customs brokers licenses, though the application process and general rules governing each type of license differ from each other. To be eligible to obtain for a US Customs broker license, an individual applicant must satisfy several requirements: first, he or she must pass the US Customs Broker License Exam (CBLE) with a score of 75% or higher; on or before the date of application, he or she must be a United States citizen, must have attained the age of 21, and must not be a federal employee; and he or she must be of good moral character. The individual must submit his or her license application, along with license application fee, within three years of having passed the CBLE. This three year time limit is calculated from the date of the letter informing the examinee that he or she passed the CBLE. Upon receipt of a license application package, CBP reviews it on its merits. License eligibility for non-individuals is different. In order to be eligible to obtain a US Customs broker license, a partnership must have at least one member of the partnership who is a broker. An association or corporation must, first, be empowered under its articles of association or articles of incorporation to transact customs business as a broker, and second, have at least one officer who is a broker. Customs broker licensees are not government employees and should not be confused with \\"customs officers\\" (in other countries, however, the two terms may be interchangeable). Customs brokers need to be familiar with the tariff schedule, a listing of duty rates for imported items, CATAIR, the statutory and regulatory rules governing importations, and other trade related matters. To illustrate, a customs broker may need to advise an importer on the marking requirements of the country of origin, or complete paperwork for a clothing shipment subject to quotas and visa requirements. Knowing the requirements of each type of import can avoid costly delays, merchandise seizures, and fines and penalties that may be levied against the importer and/or broker. European Union For customs brokers and clearing agents operating within the European Union, there is no licensing system. The onus is firmly on the importer or exporter to ensure that any party acting on their behalf is in possession of the facts to do so. Article 5 of the current customs code (Council Regulation 2913/1992) deals with representation, a key concept. This provision allows an importer or exporter to appoint a third party to act on their behalf. The importer or exporter can appoint the third party to act in two capacities, i.e., as a direct representative or as an indirect representative. A direct representative will act on behalf of the importer/exporter but will have no responsibility for the customs debt arising from their actions, whereas an indirect representative will have a joint and several liability for the customs debt. In almost all cases, the third party will elect to provide brokerage services on a direct representation basis. As a result, the importer or exporter is fully exposed to the risk or error and omission by the customs broker.

All declarations are made online through Singapore Customs' Tradenet systemGovernment of Singapore Customs using one of the Tradenet Front End applications licensed by Singapore Customs for that purpose. Whilst there is no Customs Broker role explicitly recognised by Singapore Customs, there is separate recognition for the various service providers within the customs processing chain. These are as follows: Declaring Entity - The declaring entity is the importer or exporter of record and whose Unique Identifying Number (UEN) is being used to make a declaration for import, export or transshipment. Declaring Agent - A declaring agent is an organisation appointed by a declaring entity to make a declaration on its behalf. A declaring agent may be a freight forwarder or a specialist customs service provider such as Tradenet Services Pte Ltd (TNETS). Declarant - A declarant is the individual person making the declaration for the declaring agent. Effective Jan 7, 2013 declarants must be registered with Singapore Customs and have passed Singapore Customs competency tests. TradeNet Front End Solution Provider - A provider of software through which declarations to Singapore Customs' Tradenet system can be made.

A complicated scrutiny of Customs Duty, Tax rates and government trade regulations and Quarantine permission may have to be undertaken first. Brokers are trained and licensed to provide consultancy services of the above nature as accuracy is critical to the importer. Due to the brokers intimate knowledge of the client‚Äôs business activities their relationship can be difficult to break. When a broker receives the documents for a job they register it in the company system, then to process a customs entry they must: *Classify goods in accordance with customs regulations *Obtain relevant permits from the importer *Process the customs entry in a ‚Äòcompile‚Äô system, and; *Pay duties and taxes on behalf of the importer After the above is completed and clearance from customs has been given a complete dispatch is made.

In the 1940s, he was a creator of comic books, including Nelvana of the Northern Lights. Life and work Born in Barmouth, Gwynedd, north Wales, he emigrated to Canada when he was three years old. He had settled in the Toronto region, building a house in Erindale (now part of Mississauga) in the late 1940s, and working on a new house in Caledon prior to his death. Adrian Dingle began his career in art in the early 1930s. In 1931, he studied under J. W. Beatty at the summer school of the Ontario College of Art, Toronto. From 1935 to 1937 he worked in England, employed as an illustrator for Stillwell & Darby, London, and studied at the Goldsmith's College of Art, London, under James Bateman and John Mansbridge. He exhibited with the London Portrait Society. After returning to Canada, he continued his work in illustration and taught at the Doon School of Fine Arts (Kitchener, Ontario) and the Etobicoke Community Art School. Dingle was well known for his landscapes, seascapes, portraits and figure studies. He painted landscapes from his travels to Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the British Isles, Massachusetts, and Cape Breton Island. He was a prolific painter, mostly in oils, exhibiting frequently with the T. Eaton Fine Art Gallery. Currently, his paintings are sometimes available out of Roberts Gallery (Toronto, Ontario). Dingle was, in fact, a prolific painter who was widely respected as an illustrator, teacher, and landscape artist. One of his works, representative of his impressionistic style, At the Base of a Millrace, Streetsville, Ontario, is adventurous in that it attempts to create the illusion of stone and water in a novel way. Dingle was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, the Ontario Society of Artists, the Ontario Institute of Painters, and was a Fellow of the International Institute of Arts & Letters. Dingle has come to be well known for his work in the Canadian comic book industry. From August 1941 to 1947, he authored and illustrated the comic book series Nelvana of the Northern Lights. Nelvana was the first female Canadian superhero comic character whose debut was four months before that of Wonder Woman. Another of Dingle's comic characters was the suave tuxedo-clad masked detective \\"The Penguin\\", a Canadian superhero distinct from the well- known nemesis of Batman. To avoid conflicts with Batman's publishers, this character was renamed The Blue Raven to allow efforts to reach an American audience. The Penguin premiered in 1943. Other characters include \\"Nils Grant, Private Investigator\\". At the end of the 1940s the comics industry in Canada became untenable and Dingle returned to painting. Dingle died at age 63 in Toronto at Wellesley Hospital due to complications from cancer treatment. He had three sons with his wife Patricia. He was posthumously inducted into the Joe Shuster Awards Hall of Fame in 2005.

The population of the civil parish including Hollingwood taken at the 2011 census was 8,788. The town of Staveley is to the east, and Hollingwood is nearby. The parish includes Brimington Common along the Calow Road, and New Brimington, a late 19th-century extension towards the Staveley Iron Works. History The route of Icknield Street, a Roman road, passes close to the village. Brimington appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Brimintune. At that time, the manor was the property of King William I and the population was recorded as being sixteen villagers, two smallholders and one slave. Although there was a church in the village in the medieval period, it was a chapel of ease with the parish church being Chesterfield.Hall p. 341 In the autumn of 1603, there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Brimington; the victims were buried in the village but were recorded in the parish register at Chesterfield.Hall pp. 341-342 The Chesterfield Canal, which was built just to the north of the village, opened in 1777. In 1796, the old church of St Michael and All Angels was demolished and replaced with a new building, of which only the tower survives. The present church was rebuilt in 1847 and contains a war memorial by Charles Sargeant Jagger; it is a Grade II listed building. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1806. In 1831, the population of Brimington was 759 people living in 142 houses.Hall p. 342 In 1881, Alfred Gough was hanged in Derby for the murder of six year-old Eleanor Wendle of Brimington, who was picking blackberries in the local fields. The manor house, Brimington Hall, was built in the 16th and 17th centuries and was the home of the Foljambe, Heywood, Coke and Markham families; it was demolished in 1924 but a fragment of its parkland survives as a green space on either side of Hall Road, just south of the church. Local government Brimington was originally a chapelry within the ancient parish of Chesterfield, but was created a separate parish in September 1844. The Local Government Act 1894 established it as a civil parish with a parish council distinct from the church. It forms two wards, of Chesterfield Borough Council; Brimington North and Brimington South. The parish council maintains a community centre in Heywood Street which is used by a number of local organisations. Education Brimington has two infant schools, Henry Bradley Infant School and Brimington Manor. Pupils generally feed into Brimington Junior School. Local secondary schools include Springwell Community College and Netherthorpe School. Local amenities Brimington has a small library, various businesses including a chemist, car garages and showrooms, shops and a petrol station. There is an old pub called the Ark Tavern, next to what is now a care home. The building housing the care home used to be called Sutton Lodge (formerly Sutton Villa) and dates from about 1780‚Äì90. Other pubs in the centre of Brimington are Brimming with Beer, The Red Lion, The Three Horseshoes, The Butchers Arms and the most recently built, The Corner House, which has now been demolished and is part of the caravan store. Towards the lower end of Brimington, overlooking the Chesterfield Canal, is The Mill and along Brimington Common are The Miner's Arms and The Brickmakers Arms (which has since closed and has been converted into a residential property). Brimington also has several takeaway businesses with foods including Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, pizza, kebab and several traditional fish and chip shops. The village has two churches, an education centre and a taxi rank. Chesterfield's crematorium is in Brimington, on the road into Chesterfield. Built in 20 acres of ground bought in 1954, it was opened in 1959. Chesterfield local council website.

With Klingon leader Gowron having declared hostilities against the Federation, Worf, Sisko, Odo, and O'Brien go on a mission deep into Klingon territory. \\"Apocalypse Rising\\" was seen by about 5.5 million viewers when it debuted.http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Ds9/Ratings/ratings5.html Plot Having learned from Odo that a Changeling has taken Gowron's form and is now in control of the Klingon empire, Sisko is ordered by Starfleet Command to expose the impostor. He, Odo, O'Brien, and Worf (the first disguised as Klingons) must infiltrate Ty'Gokor, the headquarters of the Klingon military, impersonating candidates for the \\"order of the Bat'leth\\". They are given four devices which, when activated, will emit radiation which will force any nearby Changeling to revert to its natural gelatinous state. Gul Dukat escorts them to Ty'Gokor in his captured Klingon Bird of Prey. The four arrive at the Hall of Warriors, where the all-night party before the induction ceremony has already begun, and try to blend in as best as they can. When General Martok, second in command to Gowron, arrives, the four scramble to set up their radiation emitters. Gowron arrives a and begins issuing the awards. When Sisko is called to receive his award, he attempts to activate the emitters, but is knocked to the floor by Martok, who has finally recognized them and has them thrown in a security cell. Once they are alone, Martok confides to Sisko that he too believes that Gowron is an impostor. With the emitters destroyed, the only way to expose Gowron is to kill him. Martok releases Sisko and his group and leads them back to the Hall of Warriors. Worf challenges Gowron to a one- on-one duel. Martok wonders why Sisko does not shoot Gowron outright. Odo observes that Gowron chose to fight Worf in single combat, thus showing Klingon honor, while Changelings do not care for honor. Odo concludes that the Changeling is not Gowron, but Martok. Just when Worf is about to kill Gowron, Odo reveals the false Martok to the crowd, and the Klingons open fire, quickly destroying the Changeling. Gowron realizes that Odo was fed false intelligence that Gowron was the Changeling, which would have led to Gowron's assassination by the Federation, thus allowing the fake Martok, and thus the Dominion, to gain control of the Klingon Empire. Gowron agrees to a ceasefire in the war between the Klingons and the Federation, and Sisko and his men are returned safely back to DS9. Production The primary photography for the episode was conducted on Stage 18 at the Paramount Pictures lot which was used to represent the Klingon Hall of Warriors. The set featured statues high. Different styles of lighting were used in the Hall as compared to the Klingon prison in order to ensure that the two looked different. While there were flicker boxes installed in the Hall of Warriors set in order to give the appearance of fire, overhead blue lighting was used in the prison in order to make the set look much colder. Because of the size of the Hall of Warriors, cinematographer Jonathan West used bleached muslin to hide fluorescent lamps in the window treatments. The bridge of the Bird of Prey was lit by overhead lights through patterned grids. One scene which featured over a hundred Klingons on scene was shot with only fifty extras. West used a split-screen effect filmed three times with a locked off camera each time which was then composited together in post effects. Reception \\"Apocalypse Rising\\" was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series for the work by Jonathan West.

Jewish Action, Summer 1993, Vol. 53, No. 3, pp. 41-44. is a long, linen sash used as a binding for the Sefer Torah by Jews of Germanic (Yekke) origin. It is made from the cloth used to swaddle a baby boy at his bris milah, uniting the communal world of the synagogue with the individual's own life cycle. The wimpel is an offshoot of a common Jewish practice. In the times of the Tannaim, all Torah scrolls were wrapped only with a cloth, known in Hebrew as a ‚Äúmappah,‚Äù or in German, a ‚Äúwimpel.‚Äù As with other holy Judaic objects, donating a mappah was considered to be a great mitzvah and honor, and very often a groom would donate one on the eve of his wedding. Most of these were made from old clothing. While some Rabbis approved of this practice, others did not because they felt that it was not proper respect for the Torah. Unlike these controversial ‚Äúsecond-hand‚Äù mappot, the cloth used at a baby's circumcision was undoubtedly holy, and it gradually became the custom to donate these as mappot. There are many variations as to what takes place at the actual wimpel ceremony. One common approach is to bring it to synagogue when the boy turns three and is toilet-trained. He and his father get the aliyah of gelilah, and together they wrap the wimpel around the Torah. (Variations include the child's age, the type of aliyah, and the extent of the child's participation in the actual ceremony.) Afterwards, the family invites the community to join them for a kiddush, a small celebratory party. This custom is still observed today by most members of the German community. It is an extremely joyous occasion, and its main purpose is to instill a love and enthusiasm for shul and Judaism within the child. Origins Some attribute the origins of the custom to a story recorded about a time when the Maharil was the sandek. It is customary to wrap a baby's legs after the circumcision to prevent him from moving around and knocking the bandages out of place. On this particular occasion, the circumciser, known as the \\"mohel\\", suddenly realized that he had forgotten to bring along the cloth for the baby's legs. The Maharil felt that this was a life-threatening situation, and he instructed the mohel to use a spare mappah from one of the synagogue's Torahs as the cloth. The Maharil also told the child's parents to wash it once they were done with it and return it to the synagogue with a minor contribution. However, there are reasons to believe that the practice of using the cloth from the circumcision predates the Maharil, and the story is only of interest to illustrate that the cloth, even after being sanctified with the holiness of the Sefer Torah, may be used for the wrapping of the baby at the circumcision. See Rabbi Rabbi Binyamin Shlomo Hamburger's Shoroshei Minhag Ashkenaz for more details about this discussion. On display in the Jewish Museum in Worms, Germany: Wimpels which were damaged during Kristallnacht This incident highlighted the connection between the Torah and circumcision, as both relate to covenants that the Jewish people have with God (the covenants of Torah and circumcision). The custom gradually developed into the one that is practiced today by German Jews: At a baby's circumcision, the mohel places a long swatch of white cloth - the wimpel ‚Äì under the pillow. Afterwards, the wimpel is beautifully decorated ‚Äì it can be either painted or embroidered ‚Äì with the child's name, date of birth, and the Hebrew phrase which states ‚ÄúJust like he entered the [covenant of] circumcision, so too he should [the covenant of] Torah, marriage, and good deeds.‚Äù Some mothers do the artwork themselves; others retain the services of ‚Äúwimpel professionals,‚Äù e.g., men or women who do this as a side job or hobby. Another explanation comes from an 80-year-old lady who remembers a ceremony from her synagogue in Germany, where the young child was brought to the synagogue once he was free of diapers, and the women would throw the Wimpel on the torah, while the men carried the torah below ezrat nashim. The Wimpel was then dedicated to the synagogue, symbolizing the fact the child is now pure, and can take part in the service. Creating the wimpel The wimpel is created shortly after the brit milah using the swaddling cloth that was used at that ceremony. The cloth is cleaned, cut into strips and sewn into a sash measuring six or seven inches wide and ten or twelve feet long. The child's Hebrew name and date of birth are painted or embroidered onto the cloth, usually by the mother or grandmother, along with the traditional blessing: * ◊î' ◊ô◊í◊ì◊ú◊î◊ï ◊ú◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊ï◊ú◊ó◊ï◊§◊î ◊ï◊ú◊û◊¢◊©◊ô◊ù ◊ò◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊û◊ü *\\"...may God raise him up to [a life of] Torah, a successful marriage, and good deeds, Amen.\\" Colorful images such as animals, birds and astrological signs, and scenes pertaining to the blessing ‚Äì such as a bride and groom under the chuppah and a Sefer Torah ‚Äì have also adorned modern and old-world wimpels. Bringing the wimpel Wimpel painted on linen, Jewish Museum (New York) When the child comes of age to begin learning Torah (age 3), he and his family bring the wimpel to the synagogue for Shabbat morning services. After the Torah reading, the child performs the ritual of gelila, perhaps with the help of his father, by wrapping the wimpel many times around the Torah scroll and tucking the end of the cloth into the folds. In this way, the child's individual responsibilities to God and His commandments are literally wrapped around his communal responsibilities, a figurative lesson for the child and his family. Rabbi Shimon Schwab, Rav of Khal Adath Yeshurun synagogue in Washington Heights, New York, which revived the custom among the younger generation of Yekke congregants, suggested that perhaps the source of the wimpel custom was to avoid knotting and unknotting a tie around the Torah on Shabbat (see the 39 categories of activity prohibited on the Sabbath). On that first Shabbat that the wimpel is presented and used, the child's family makes a kiddush in honor of their son's entering into a life of Torah. Other uses The synagogue typically receives many more wimpels than Torah scrolls. The wimpels are often stored in a drawer in the Ark. A boy's wimpel would then be placed on the Torah on other special occasions in his life, such as his Bar Mitzvah, Aufruf, and other important family events. Some wimpels were even used as a decorative banner on the chuppah itself.  Lengnau Mappot  One of the most extensive collections of mappot was found in the 1960s in the Surbtal in the Swiss canton of Aargau. The 218 textiles, which had been discovered in the women's gallery of the synagogue in Lengnau, span three centuries. The oldest one dates back to 1655. In 1967 the mappot were examined by Dr. Florence Guggenheim-Gr√ºnberg. The same year, they became part of the collection of the Jewish Museum of Switzerland.

The film was made on a reported budget of 40 crore and grossed over 122 crore at the worldwide box office; Box Office India declared it a Super Hit. It is loosely based on the 1999 comedy Mickey Blue Eyes. Welcome released worldwide on 21 December 2007, to mixed critical reviews, and despite initial competition from Taare Zameen Par, was a strong financial success at the box office both in India and overseas. According to The Hindu, the film's climax scene is a rip-off from the Charlie Chaplin film, The Gold Rush which had been earlier used in the 1990 Tamil film Michael Madana Kama Rajan. Plot Uday (Nana Patekar), a criminal don, takes it upon himself to get his kindhearted sister, Sanjana (Katrina Kaif) married, but he is unsuccessful since no one wants to be associated with a crime family. Dr. Ghunghroo (Paresh Rawal) has also been trying to get his nephew, Rajiv (Akshay Kumar) an auctioneer, married but due to his condition‚Äîthe alliance must be with a purely decent family‚Äîhe is also unsuccessful. When Rajiv jumps into a burning building to save Sanjana, he is smitten by her. Uday and Majnu (Anil Kapoor), Uday's brother gangster hatch a plan for an alliance with Dr. Ghunghroo. The plan works and Dr. Ghunghroo confirms the alliance, thinking that Uday is a very decent man. But when he is later told that Uday and Majnu are mobsters, he quickly takes his family and flees to Sun City, South Africa to escape. However, Majnu and Sanjana have come to Sun City as well. Rajiv meets Sanjana again and the two fall in love. After an initial showdown with them as he comes to know they are Sanjana's brothers and as they are confronted by Rajiv, Dr. Ghunghroo reconciles with Uday and Majnu and finally agrees to the alliance. Uday and Majnu invite a powerful don of the underworld, RDX (Feroz Khan) to the engagement. At the party, a girl named Ishika (Mallika Sherawat) arrives, claiming to be Rajiv's childhood betrothed. Ishika is actually Dr. Ghunghroo's sister-in-law, who he asked to come and try to break off the engagement. Ishika manages to do so, leaving Rajiv and Sanjana heartbroken. Dr. Ghunghroo reveals that he did this for Rajiv's mother, who had married into a crime family and was harassed and tortured, thus telling Dr. Ghunghroo to raise Rajiv away from crime when he was born. Dr. Ghunghroo decides he will agree to the marriage only if Uday and Majnu give up their life of crime. Rajiv and Sanjana do this by reawakening Uday's love for acting and encouraging Majnu to pursue his love for painting. With these things keeping them busy, Uday and Majnu have no time for crime any more. Rajiv's actions anger RDX's son, Lucky, who attempts to shoot Rajiv. Sanjana gets hold of the gun and fires a shot that hits Lucky, causing him to go unconscious. RDX is informed of his son's death and comes to attend the cremation. However Lucky, who is still alive, escapes, trying to show his father that he's actually alive. RDX sets the pile of wood on fire, believing he is cremating his son's body. However Lucky, who had been hiding under the wood, jumps out upon realising the wood is on fire, and the truth is revealed to RDX. Rajiv, Ghunghroo, his wife, Ishika, Uday, Majnu and Sanjana are captured by RDX and brought to a cabin set next to a cliff. The frightened group is forced to play Passing the Parcel (Hot Potato) with a globe‚Äîbut the one who ends up with the globe must jump off the cliff. When Rajiv refuses to pass the globe to Sanjana, Lucky angrily yanks it out of his hands, just as the music stops. Now that his son has the globe, RDX figures the only way he can maintain his image is by killing everyone. Before he can, several government brokers sneak up and cut the footings of the cabin, causing the house to start falling over the cliff, with everyone trapped inside. However, the cabin is suspended by only one column. Hilarious chaos ensues as the group tries to balance the cabin together and keep it from falling off the cliff. Rajiv finds a rope and the group uses it to get back onto stable ground. But to everyone's shock, the floor breaks and Lucky is found hanging on the edge of the cabin. While Rajiv is trying to rescue him, Sanjana reveals the truth to everyone that she was the one who shot Lucky, but Rajiv blamed himself so that Sanjana wouldn't get in trouble. After Rajiv rescues Lucky, the cabin he is standing on falls off into the cliff. Sanjana keeps crying for him thinking he is dead. However, Rajiv survives the event and is reunited with Sanjana and his family. Lucky and RDX are grateful to Rajiv for saving their lives and RDX gives up his life of crime, allowing Rajiv and Sanjana to finally get married. However, they realise that Ishika fooled them along with Rajiv, as a part of his plan to marry Sanjana.

C. Jasper High School (also known as Jasper or JHS) is a public co- educational secondary school in Plano, Texas (USA) serving grades nine and ten. Founded in 1996, the school is part of the Plano Independent School District. Robinson Middle School and Rice Middle School feed into Jasper. Students leaving Jasper will attend Plano West Senior High School. The school colors are green, black, and white, and the school mascot is the Jaguar. In 2009, the school was rated \\"exemplary\\" by the Texas Education Agency. History Jasper was the third school built on the parcel of land shared with Gulledge Elementary School and Robinson Middle School. Jasper was constructed in time for the 1996‚Äì1997 school year; however, the completion of the , two-story building was not finished until July 1999. The company estimates that the construction cost was US$17,000,000. Jasper was the newest of the five 9‚Äì10 high schools in the Plano Independent School District. Jasper opened with an enrollment of 1,172 students, and a functional capacity of approximately 1,758 students. In 2002, the Professional Development center was vacated. The area was then renovated, creating 7 classrooms and two offices, along with the enclosure of the outdoor dining area to create a dance room. The project, with a contract price of $700,157, was designed by Corgan Associates, Inc. and built by Tywell Construction Corporation. During the 2003 Bond Election held on August 23, 2003, a $3,500,000 addition of eight temporary classrooms was approved by a vote of 3,643 for to 1,499 against, in order to combat overcrowding in the school, which had reached 1,980. This was part of a $33,550,000 bond proposal of PISD. On March 25, 2004, Big Sky Construction was chosen out of eight contractors to build an orchestra/band/choir hall. The company's proposal of $1,999,900 was more than $30,000 less expensive than the next cheapest bid to the school district. It was completed in that same year for a price of $2,000,000. On November 28, 2005, the Plano Independent School District announced the beginning of an addition of a science wing to assist in increasing Jasper's functional capacity, as the population of the school had already exceeded 2,000 students. The addition was approved in a 2004 Facility Program Bond vote by the citizens of Plano. It was a project given to the Cadence McShane Companies, and was built along with new additions to Williams High School. The addition to Jasper was completed in July 2006, costing the school district approximately $7,501,893. Also added under the contract was a fourth cafeteria line and a multipurpose room. The wooden gym floors were redone during this same time. =Namesake= Jasper High School is named in honor of Plano banker and businessman Thomas Chilton \\"T.C.\\" Jasper. Jasper was born on January 11, 1844, in Middleburg, Kentucky. He served in the Civil War in Company C, 6th Regiment Kentucky Cavalry. After the war, he returned to Kentucky and taught school. On January 8, 1874, T.C. married Mary Wilmoth Jones. The couple established a prosperous general store in nearby Mount Salem, Kentucky. Two of his children, Claude and Davie, were born there as well. In 1887, T.C. moved his family to Plano, Texas, where his third child, Roy, was born. He quickly organized the Plano National Bank, investing out of his own pocket $40,000 of the $50,000 needed for new bank stock. The bank was chartered July 27, 1882, and T.C. served as cashier for 25 years before retiring in March 1913. In addition to owning business properties in and around Plano, T.C. Jasper was a co-founder of the Plano Cotton Oil Company (established in 1902 and dissolved in 1916). In 1904, T.C., along with seven other men, formed the \\"44 Club\\"; its members were Confederate veterans and were all born in 1844. He served as treasurer of the Texas Electric Railroad, was a deacon in the First Baptist Church, a Mason for 55 years (as well as a charter member of the Plano chapter), and an honorary member of the Lions Club. T.C. died in 1924 at the age of 80, after 50 years of marriage. His wife, Mary, died in 1940.PLANO, TEXAS: The Early Years; Henington Publishing Company, 1985 Extracurricular activities The extracurricular activities offered at Jasper High School are many and varied due to the school's large size. There are chapters of national organizations such as the National Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, (Leadership Education & Training); National Honor Society and clubs founded by Jasper students, such as The Effect, Jasper GSA, the Muslim Student Association (MSA), and Jasper K-Pop Dance Club. Service organizations such as the Peer Tutoring Society coexist alongside clubs where students can have fun, such as Jasper's Math Club. =Academic competition= Jasper has a prominent speech and debate team that competes up to the state level in the TFA (Texas Forensics Association), national level in the NSDA (National speech and Debate Association), and the international level in IPPF (International Public Policy Forum). Jasper also has a competitive quizbowl club which was founded in 2018. Jasper qualified for the 2019 NAQT (National Academic Quiz Tournaments) High School National Championship Tournament and continues to stay competitive in the circuit. =Athletics= Jasper fields 13 teams in six different sports; 7 men's teams and 6 women's teams: football (9th and 10th grades), volleyball (9th and 10th grades), basketball (9th and 10th grades), tennis (9th and 10th grades), baseball, golf and track (9th and 10th grades). Students in Marching Band receive athletic credit towards graduation, as do students in the JROTC program. =Music program= In 1996, Jasper's first year, sophomores Jessica Ridings (Edwards) wrote the lyrics to the school song. Ridings became the Drum Major of the TCU band. Jasper's music program is one of the most decorated in Texas. The Legacy Orchestra is consistently listed among the best in the state, ranking as one of the top five string orchestras in Texas 10 times since 2001. In 2012-2013, the Jasper Symphony Orchestra (Legacy Orchestra and Wind Ensemble members) won the distinguished title of 2014 Texas Honor Full Orchestra, becoming the first non-varsity orchestra to ever be named Honor Orchestra in the state of Texas. All of the music programs (band, choir, and orchestra) have many qualifiers for the All-State honor each year. Each of them also routinely earns University Interscholastic League (UIL) Sweepstakes Awards, the highest rating awarded at the annual Texas UIL large group competition. Awards * In October 2006, Jasper was one of eight PISD schools and 268 Texas public schools (out of 7,519, or the top 3%) to earn recognition on the Texas Business and Education Coalition Honor Roll. * Jasper has received the 'Commended Performance' designation in English/Reading/Language Arts, Math and Science, Social Studies, and Attendance Rate. * In 2015 Jasper Legacy Orchestra placed 1st runner up in the TMEA state convention. * In 2019, Jasper High School was declared a National Speech and Debate Association School of Excellence in Speech. * At the 2019 NSDA National Speech and Debate Tournament, Jasper High School students Pranav Pattatathunaduvil and Angela Wang came second and fifth, respectively, in International Extemporaneous Speaking.

It is a partial wig that only has hair in the front, the rest typically covered by a small pillbox hat or a headscarf. The hairpiece may actually be silk or lace, or else made of synthetic fibers, to avoid too closely resembling real hair. According to Jewish law (halacha) concerning modesty (tzniut), a woman must cover her hair after marriage.Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer 115, 4; Orach Chayim 75,2; Even Ha'ezer 21, 2Schiller, Mayer. \\"The Obligation of Married Women to Cover Their Hair\\". JHCS 30, 1995, 81‚Äì108. The shpitzel was popular among Hungarian Hasidim in the 19th century, and it is worn by some contemporary women who follow the customs of that community. Etymology The Yiddish word \\"Shpitzel\\" is related to the grammatical diminutive of the high- German word \\"Spitze\\" which can either mean \\"point\\" or \\"lace\\"; the latter translation is most likely the right one in the context of this article. (It must not be confused with the high-German \\"Spitzel\\" which is a spy or a snitch.) The term shpitzel may also be used to refer to the ends of a loaf of bread in some dialects. In this case, the above-mentioned translation \\"Spitze\\" = (end)point/peak is applicable, with its High German grammatical diminutive \\"Spitzchen\\".

A 2005 documentary on New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers listed him as number 89. Today he is involved with the protest group Global Peace and Justice Auckland and the Unite Union. He also wrote a weekly column for The PressJohnMinto.org.nz Archive of Minto's Press articles, in weblog format and was formerly editor of the (now defunct) Workers' Charter newspaper. Minto is a long time member of the Post Primary Teachers Association (PPTA) and also a National Vice Chairperson of QPEC, Quality Public Education Coalition (Inc) and co-vice-president of the Mana Movement. Halt All Racist Tours Trevor Richards, Tom Newnham and others formed Halt All Racist Tours to protest against rugby union tours to and from Apartheid South Africa, in 1969. Minto became the National Chairman of the organisation in 1980. He was assaulted by rugby supporters the evening after a disruptive protest at Rugby Park in Hamilton. This prompted him to add a protective helmet to his distinctive outfit of overalls. He remained at the forefront of the protests. The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (SIS) listed Minto in 1981 on a list of 'subversives' for the events of that year. In 2005 a police baton owned by Ross Meurant, a former member of Parliament who was second in charge of the \\"Red Squad\\" during the 1981 Springbok Tour was put up for auction online labelled as a \\"Minto Bar\\", a \\"joke\\" based on the co-incidence of names between John Minto and Minties, the brand name of a popular mint-flavoured sweet. In 2009 John Minto's helmet appeared in an episode of Tales from Te Papa a television series of mini-documentaries about objects from the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Companion of OR Tambo Award During January 2008 Minto publicly \\"rejected\\" a nomination for the South African Companion of OR Tambo Award, saying he was dismayed over current conditions in the country. However, the Presidency of South Africa later stated that Minto had not been nominated for any national award. Global peace and justice protests in Auckland In January 2009 Minto led a protest to the Auckland Tennis Stadium, where they demanded that Israeli player Shahar Pe'er, who served a compulsory two-years service in the Israel Defense Forces, withdraw from the tournament and denounce the Israeli Government and its actions in the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel-Gaza conflict, adding that she should respect international calls for a boycott against Israel. Pe'er ignored the group's demands and participated in the tournament as planned, stating at a press conference that \\"I think [the politics] is nothing to do with what I am doing\\". Maurice Williamson, a member of parliament, rebuffed the protesters at the event, stating that Pe'er was not representing Israel and was playing as a private individual, and that thus the protesters should \\"leave her alone\\". A similar protest occurred at the January 2010 event, where Shahar Pe'er again competed. On the third day of protest (7 January 2010) John Minto was one of five protesters arrested outside the ASB Tennis Centre in Auckland on a charge of disorderly behaviour. He was later issued with a 500-metre trespass-order to prevent him from continuing disruption of the play inside the tennis centre. Mayoralty bids In April 2013, Minto announced his intention to run for the mayoralty of Auckland on the Mana Movement ticket. Minto has several candidates that are running for Councillor on the Minto for Mayor ticket. In July 2016, Minto announced he will run in the 2016 Christchurch mayoral election as a candidate for The Keep Our Assets group.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/82021018/keep-our-assets-run- john-minto-as-christchurch-mayoral-candidate?cid=facebook.post.82021018 Internet Mana  Minto stood in the 2014 elections as a candidate for the Internet Mana party, Minto is ranked 4th on the party list.

Linares, who played third base for the Cuban national team and for Pinar del R√≠o and Vegueros in the Cuban National Series wearing the number 10 on his jersey, is considered one of the greatest Cuban players of all time. Linares's first steps in the world of sports were as a track and field athlete where he was considered a promising star at a young age. Linares soon decided to follow the steps of his father Fidel Linares in the world of baseball. He is well known in Cuba for having started a baseball career at a very young age. It is to Cuban baseball broadcaster Bobby Salamanca to whom it is attributed the popularity of Linares's nickname \\"El Ni√±o\\" (The Kid) after Linares impressed Salamanca with his baseball skills as a teen being called to the roster of Cuban national team being only 17, it is to former manager Jose Miguel Pineda that Linares attributes the authority of his nickname in 1982. After a career as a player in Cuba, Linares along with other Cuban baseball stars such as Antonio Pacheco, Orestes Kindelan and German Mesa in coordination with the Cuban national baseball commission decided to give it a try in the Nippon Professional Baseball. Linares went on to spending three unproductive seasons with the Chunichi Dragons wearing the number 44 on his jersey to later after return to Cuba. In 2009 Linares decided to become a batting coach and first base coach for longtime rival team Industriales helping them to conquer a national championship (his first as an assistant coach). Although Linares never received an official retiring ceremony, the season of 2001‚Äì2002 is considered to be his last appearance in Cuban National Baseball Series. Career in Cuba Linares spent 20 seasons with Pinar del R√≠o in Cuba's National Series, compiling a career .368 batting average, the best in the league's history, with 404 home runs (third among all-times in Cuban league), 1,547 runs batted in and 264 stolen bases. He led the National Series in batting average four times, in RBIs four times and in walks six times. At the end of his career, Linares spent three seasons with the Chunichi Dragons of Japan's Central League. He retired in 2004. International career As a 14-year-old, Linares was the starting second baseman for the Cuban National youth team at the world championship, where they got the gold. His debut in Cuban national baseball series at the age of 14 was marked by his father's decision of not allowing him to play with Forestales (second team of Pinar del R√≠o) on road games, therefore Linares only played home games that year. The inclusion of Linares in the Cuban national team at the age of 17 as an optional replacement of slugger Jose \\"Cheito\\" Rodriguez short after a controversial suspension of \\"Cheito\\" by the Cuban National baseball commission is attributed to former manager Jose Miguel Pineda. After being called up, Linares was a mainstay on the Cuban national baseball team under the guidance of baseball star Luis Giraldo Casanova during much of the 1980s and 1990s, as the starting third baseman on world championship winning teams in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2001. He was part of Cuba's Olympic gold medal teams in 1992 and 1996, and the silver medal team in 2000. Linares also played for the Cuban national team in the 1999 Baltimore Orioles ‚Äì Cuban national baseball team exhibition series. Personal life Linares's full name is Omar Linares Izquierdo. He is the son of former Cuban baseball player Fidel Linares and Francisca \\"Panchita\\" Izquierdo. Omar has three daughters, one from his first marriage and two from his second marriage with current wife Dianelys. He has been recalled as a very soft-spoken and shy individual. He has always proclaimed his love for his family as he also refers to the loss of his father as the saddest experience of his life. Bibliography In 2002 Juan A. Martinez de Osaba y Goneaga, a baseball enthusiast and annalist, published a book called El ni√±o Linares as part of his tribute to Cuban baseball, especially to those players born in Pinar del R√≠o Province. The book is believed to be the closest and more intimate review of Omar's life as it includes transcripts of interviews with Omar himself, family members and also former teammates such as Luis Giraldo Casanova, Juan Castro, Yobal Due√±as and others and also longtime manager Jorge Fuentes.

Background David Blair was born in County Monaghan, Ireland to parents of Scottish descent. He studied at the Hibernian Military School, Dublin. He left in 1835, aged 15 years and worked in an uncle's business but did not enjoy it. In 1840 he joined the Ordnance Survey of Ireland as a calculator stationed in Limerick and then Cork. He transferred to Southampton in 1841 and for almost nine years he worked on the triangulation of England and the survey of London. Chartism Blair was unsatisfied in his work, even speculating in 1848 on a military career, and found expression in supporting the Chartists as a lecturer in Southampton, in reading and in church activities. Australia He later studied for the ministry in Ireland and came to Australia in 1850 at the suggestion of John Dunmore Lang, the intention being that he should go into the back country as a missionary. He took up journalism in Sydney, where he was associated with Henry Parkes on the Empire newspaper. Blair went to Victoria in 1852 and had a long and varied career as a journalist, including a long stint as leader writer for The Age and as a contributor to Victorian Review. Blair was elected a member of the legislative assembly of Victoria in 1856 and again in 1868, but did not make any special mark in politics. In 1876 he edited the Speeches of Henry Parkes, and in 1878 or 1879 he published the important The History of Australasia--to the Establishment of Self-Government, based largely on the works of his predecessors, and Cyclopedia of Australasia (1881). He also wrote The First Imaginary Voyage to Australia (1882). He died at Melbourne on 19 February 1899, aged 78. References Sources J. I.

The farmers attempted to organize a strike in which farmers would no longer buy or sell anything.Stevens, Paul. American Agriculture Movement Is Now A Year Old. Sarasota Herald-Tribune. 14 December 1978. Goals The organization demanded that the federal government establish higher prices of various crops, claiming that they needed \\"parity\\" between what they had to spend to grow crops versus revenues received from their crops. One of the slogans of the group was \\"Parity not Charity\\", as the farmers demanded that the government ensure that farmers were paid more for their crops. The farmers demanded to make as much profit per acre, adjusted for inflation, as farmers did at the turn of the 20th century. Protest On December 10, 1977, approximately 5,000 farmers held a rally in Lincoln, Nebraska, and were joined by Nebraska governor J. James Exon. The farmers all rode their tractors, and soon other farm states had tractor rallies. Gloria Carter Spann, sister of President Jimmy Carter even participated in one rally. While the farmers appeared to have widespread sympathy, relatively few farmers actually went on strike and refused to grow crops. The organization therefore decided to have a tractor rally in Washington, DC. The Carter administration agreed that the Farmers Home Administration would stop all foreclosures, but soon after the rally was over resumed foreclosures of farms with past due loans. In 1979, the farmers again drove their tractors to Washington, and drove on the mall, and blocked traffic, creating significant tie-ups.Herzog, James P. D.C. Farm Protesters Facing Fiscal Drought.

Its stated goals are as follows: 1\\\\. 100% Parity for all domestic and foreign used and/or consumer agriculture products. 2\\\\. All agricultural products produced for national or international food reserve shall be contracted at 100% parity. 3\\\\. Creation of an entity or structure composed of agriculture producers to advise and approve policies that affect agriculture. 4\\\\. Imports of agriculture products which are domestically produced must be stopped until 100% parity is reached. Thereafter, imports must be limited to the amount that the American producers cannot supply. 5\\\\. All announcements pertaining to any agricultural producing cycle shall be made far enough in advance that the producer will have adequate time to make needed adjustments in his operation The current sitting President (2015) is Larry Matlack of Rural Burrton, KS.

Marton was the artistic director of the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z and professor of the University of Theatre, Film and Television in Budapest. Marton was known for directing classics through a new lens and his productions have been seen in more than 40 cities throughout the world. He was Honorary Member of the London Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Marton earned three Dora Mavor Moore Awards for his Chekhov productions in Toronto, for Masterclass Theatre and for Soulpepper Theatre Company, and the Irish Times Theatre Award as Best Director for The Wild Duck, a production he directed for the Abbey Theatre (National Theatre of Ireland) in Dublin. In October 2017, several victims accused Marton of sexual harassment and assault. He initially denied the allegations, but later issued an apology. His employment at V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z was subsequently terminated. Early life and education Marton was born in Budapest, Hungary, to Ilona Keresztes, a graduate of √âcole h√¥teli√®re de Lausanne, and L√°szl√≥ Marton, Sr., a representative for a Hungarian foreign trade company. He is also related to Golden Globe Award winner Hollywood movie director Andrew Marton. Marton's interest in theatre took root early in his life, and he was first introduced to the world of opera by his godfather, Hungarian conductor, J√°nos Ferencsik. Marton attended the Secondary School of the Piarist Fathers and graduated from the University of Theatre, Film and Television in Budapest in 1967. In the same year, at the age of twenty-four he staged his first professional play at the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z, in Budapest, where he became artistic director in 1987. Career Marton's international career started in 1974 in Germany at the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar. Since then he directed for the Finnish National Theatre, Actors Theatre of Louisville, the Habima Theatre (Israel's National Theatre), the Barbican Centre in London, Santa Fe Stages in New Mexico, the Court Theatre in Chicago, the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto and others. Some of his most important theatrical works included a new adaptation of Chekhov's Platonov, (by Marton and Susan Coyne) for Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto, and productions of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya for Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto and Playmakers Repertory Company in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with set and costume designer Michael Levine. In celebration of their 10th anniversary in 2008, (Celebrating 10 Years of history's greatest plays 1998‚Äì2008) Soulpepper Theatre Company revived Marton's Production of Uncle Vanya. In 2003 Marton directed a new adaptation of Ibsen's The Wild Duck by Frank McGuinness for The Peacock Theatre in Dublin and later for Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto. His production of Dance in Time for the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z was invited to the Abbey Theatre's centenary programme in 2004. A year later he directed a production of A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen for the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, in a new version by McGuinness. As of September 2009, Marton was directing Mozart's The Magic Flute for the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z, in collaboration with the Hungarian State Opera House.http://www.opera.hu/index_e.php?module=darab_en&esemenyId;=44967&produkcioId;=7051 Marton's productions of great emotional resonance were highly acclaimed by critics for revealing a deep psychological intimacy and bringing new life to classics. An actress said that working with him is \\"incredibly demanding but he's incredibly kind as well. It just creates an atmosphere where it feels safe to risk things\\".  Sexual assault allegations  On 14 October 2017, Hungarian actress Lilla S√°rosdi alleged in a Facebook post that a well-known Hungarian theatre director had sexually assaulted her 20 years earlier. A few days later she named Marton as the perpetrator. At first Marton denied the allegations, but suspended his teaching activity and resigned from his position at V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z. On 20 October, two more people anonymously accused Marton of sexual assault. Two days later, 444.hu published an article with similar stories from several new victims. Marton declined to comment on the new allegations. One week after the original allegations, Marton issued a statement \\"'apologizing for hurting anybody or putting them in a difficult situation\\", adding that \\"he never intended to hurt or humiliate anyone\\". Lilla S√°rosdi said she accepted the apology. On the same day two new victims accused Marton of sexual assault. Subsequently, V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z initiated the termination of Marton's employment. Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre Company revealed it severed ties with Marton back in 2015 after a member of its community filed a complaint about sexual harassment. Marton's relationship with the company was immediately and permanently terminated. Soulpepper said \\"Marton's behaviour was both unacceptable in human terms and in violation of Soulpepper‚Äôs past and present policies and codes of conduct.\\" Productions Platonov (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 1999, Toronto) Uncle Vanya (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 2001, Toronto) Uncle Vanya (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 2001, Toronto) Uncle Vanya (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 2001) Uncle Vanya (Playmakers Repertory Company, 2003) Three Sisters (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 2007, Toronto) Three Sisters (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 2007, Toronto) The Wild Duck (Soulpepper Theatre Company, 2005, Toronto) *The Art of Comedy ‚Äì The Silk Hat (1967) ‚Äì V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z, Budapest *The Kiss (1968) ‚Äì Pesti Theatre, Budapest *Can you speak Spanish?

(called a primitive prime divisor) that divides and does not divide for any positive integer , with the following exceptions: *, ; then = 1 which has no prime divisors *, a power of two; then any odd prime factors of = must be contained in , which is also even *, , ; then = 63 = 32√ó7 = This generalizes Bang's theorem, And which states that if and n is not equal to 6, then has a prime divisor not dividing any with . Similarly, has at least one primitive prime divisor with the exception . Zsigmondy's theorem is often useful, especially in group theory, where it is used to prove that various groups have distinct orders except when they are known to be the same.Montgomery, H. \\"Divisibility of Mersenne Numbers.\\" 17 Sep 2001. History The theorem was discovered by Zsigmondy working in Vienna from 1894 until 1925.  Generalizations  Let (a_n)_{n\\\\ge1} be a sequence of nonzero integers. The Zsigmondy set associated to the sequence is the set \\\\mathcal{Z}(a_n) = \\\\\\\\{ n \\\\ge 1 : a_n \\\\text{ has no primitive prime divisors} \\\\\\\\}. i.e., the set of indices n such that every prime dividing a_n also divides some a_m for some m < n. Thus Zsigmondy's theorem implies that \\\\mathcal{Z}(a^n-b^n)\\\\subset\\\\\\\\{1,2,6\\\\\\\\}, and Carmichael's theorem says that the Zsigmondy set of the Fibonacci sequence is \\\\\\\\{1,2,6,12\\\\\\\\}, and that of the Pell sequence is \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}. In 2001 Bilu, Hanrot, and VoutierY. Bilu, G. Hanrot, P.M. Voutier, Existence of primitive divisors of Lucas and Lehmer numbers, J. Reine Angew. Math. 539 (2001), 75-122 proved that in general, if (a_n)_{n\\\\ge1} is a Lucas sequence or a Lehmer sequence, then \\\\mathcal{Z}(a_n) \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{ 1 \\\\le n \\\\le 30 \\\\\\\\} (see , there are only 13 such ns, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 30). Lucas and Lehmer sequences are examples of divisibility sequences. It is also known that if (W_n)_{n\\\\ge1} is an elliptic divisibility sequence, then its Zsigmondy set \\\\mathcal{Z}(W_n) is finite.J.H. Silverman, Wieferich's criterion and the abc-conjecture, J. Number Theory 30 (1988), 226-237 However, the result is ineffective in the sense that the proof does not give an explicit upper bound for the largest element in \\\\mathcal{Z}(W_n), although it is possible to give an effective upper bound for the number of elements in \\\\mathcal{Z}(W_n).P.

The genre was invented after the 16th century in England, as a result of increasing public interest in realistic depictions of \\"exotic\\" locales. The term was most popularly used in the late nineteenth century. As a literary work, it is also often referred to simply as the sketch.The Penguin Henry Lawson Short Stories (first published 1986); with an introduction by John Barnes, Camberwell, Victoria: Penguin Books Australia, pp. 1-16 Style A sketch is mainly descriptive, either of places (travel sketch) or of people (character sketch). Writers of sketches like Washington Irving clearly used the artist as a model. A sketch story is a hybrid form. It may contain little or no plot, instead describing impressions of people or places, and is often informal in tone. In the nineteenth century, sketch stories were frequently published in magazines, before falling out of favour.Hamilton, Kristie. America's sketchbook: the cultural life of a nineteenth-century literary genre - Athens, Ohio : Ohio Univ. Press, 1998 Such stories may focus on individual moments, leaving the reader to imagine for themselves the events that led to this occasion, and to wonder what events will follow. Writers from Sherwood Anderson to John Updike used this form, often as a hybrid. In short, a sketch story aims at \\"suggestiveness rather than explicitness\\". Modern usage In modern usage, the term \\"short story\\" embraces what was once popularly termed \\"the sketch\\". Short stories of extreme brevity still exist under the names flash fiction or microfiction. Popular writers of sketch stories *Anton Chekhov (1860‚Äì1904): A major Russian short story writer and playwright. The point of a typical Chekhov story is most often what happens within a given character, and that is conveyed indirectly, by suggestion or by significant detail. Chekhov eschews the traditional build-up of chronological detail, instead emphasizing moments of epiphanies and illumination over a significantly shorter period of time. *Washington Irving (1783‚Äì1859) Most popular for The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., a book of thirty essays and short stories. *Henry Lawson (1867‚Äì1922): Australian writer Henry Lawson is noted for his sketch stories, many featuring recurring characters such as Jack Mitchell and Steelman and Smith. In 1933, Edward Garnett praised Lawson's sketches, once observing that \\"Lawson gets even more feeling observation and atmosphere into a page than does Hemingway.\\" Lawson, himself, was a firm believer in the merits of \\"the sketch\\": > \\"I thought the short story was a lazy man's game, second to 'free' verse, > compared with the sketch. The sketch, to be really good, must be good in > every line. But the sketch-story is best of all.\\" *Saki (1870‚Äì1916) Edwardian satirist, first published in the Westminster Gazette. His short stories were collected as books still in print 100 years later. His Parliamentary sketches were popular at the time. *Saadat Hassan Manto (1912‚Äì1955) Combining psychoanalysis with human behaviour, Manto was arguably one of the best short story tellers of the 20th century, and one of the most controversial as well. When it comes to chronicling the collective madness that prevailed, during and after the Partition of India in 1947, no other writer comes close to the oeuvre of Saadat Hassan Manto.

Its first known member, Olof Mattsson, is documented between 1381 and 1415, having a seat in Halikko parish.Carlquist, Gunnar (red.) (1932). Svensk uppslagsbok. Malm√∂: Svensk Uppslagsbok AB:s f√∂rlag, band 13 s. 312. His seal featured the figure of a drinking horn. Like other Swedish noble families of medieval origin, the family name wasn't used as a surname before the 16th century. Several descendants of Olof Mattsson have been ennobled under extended versions of the family name. Today, only one of these branches still exists, as recognized by the Swedish House of Nobility. After the Finnish war, the Horn family remained in Sweden, and was not introduced in the new Finnish House of Nobility. Branches =Horn af √Öminne= After Klas Horn, raised to baron (sw. friherre) under the name Horn af √Öminne in 1561. In 1772 brothers Fredric and Gustaf Adolf Horn af √Öminne were raised to counts under the same name. The name derives from the manor √Öminne in Halikko, which was in the possession of the family from the 14th century to 1782. Members of the Horn af √Öminne branch include: * Klas Horn af √Öminne (1517‚Äì1566), admiral of the Swedish navy. * Clas Fredrik Horn af √Öminne (1763‚Äì1823), part of the conspiracy to murder King Gustav III. * Catharina Ebba Horn af √Öminne (1720‚Äì1781) * Henric Horn af √Öminne (1880‚Äì1947), participant in the 1912 olympics. =Horn af Kanckas= Registered as a noble family in 1625. Named after the Kankas manor (fi. Kankainen) in Masku. The spelling reflects an older Swedish orthographical tradition. The male line went extinct in 1728. The branches Horn af Bj√∂rneborg, Horn af Marienborg and Horn af Ekebyholm all descend from the Horn af Kanckas branch. Members of the Horn af √Öminne branch include: * Henrik Klasson Horn af Kanckas (1512‚Äì95) Horn af Bj√∂rneborg After Gustaf Horn, raised to count under the name Horn af Bj√∂rneborg in 1651. Named after the crown estate of Bj√∂rneborg, present-day Pori. The male line went extinct in 1657. Members of the Horn af Bj√∂rneborg branch include: * Gustaf Horn af Bj√∂rneborg (1592-1657), Swedish field marshal. * Agneta Horn af Bj√∂rneborg (1629-1672), known for her autobiographical writings. Horn af Marienborg After Henrik Horn, raised to count under the name Horn af Marienborg in 1651. Named after Marienburg Castle (Latvian Al≈´ksne) in Livonia. The male line went extinct in 1728. * Henrik Horn af Marienborg (1618‚Äì93), Swedish field marshal. Horn af Ekebyholm After Arvid Horn, rased to baron under the name Horn af Ekebyholm in 1700, and later again to count in 1706. Named after Ekebyholm Castle in Uppland. The male line went extinct in 1798. Members of the Horn af Ekebyholm branch include: * Arvid Horn af Ekebyholm (1664-1742), Swedish President of the Privy Council Chancellery.

They were very effective ships: all except Eastwind served at least thirty years, and Northwind served in the USCG continuously for forty- four years. Considered the most technologically advanced icebreakers in the world when first built, the Wind-class icebreakers were also heavily armed; the first operator of the class was the United States Coast Guard, which used the vessels for much-needed coastal patrol off Greenland during World War II. Three of the vessels of the class, Westwind, Southwind, and the first Northwind all went on to serve temporarily for the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program, while two others were built for the United States Navy and another was built for the Royal Canadian Navy; all eight vessels were eventually transferred to the United States Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard.U.S. Department of Homeland Security. U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office. http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Icebreakers.asp Charles D. \\"Doug\\" Maginley. The Canadian Coast Guard 1962-2002. Vanwell Publishing LTD. 2003. .My Royal Canadian Navy. http://myrcn.ca/18labrador/labrador.html The Wind-class ships were the first class of true icebreakers built by the United States. Gibbs & Cox of New York provided the designs with input from the Coast Guard's Naval Engineering Division. The final design was heavily influenced by studies conducted by then LCDR Edward Thiele, USCG (later RADM, and Engineer in Chief of the U.S. Coast Guard) of foreign icebreakers, namely the Swedish Ymer, built in 1931, and the Soviet Krasin. Seven ships of the class were built in the United States, and one modified version, HMCS Labrador, was built in Canada.Icebreakers in the North. University of Calgary. https://www.ucalgary.ca/arcticexpedition/icebreakers/hmcs-labrador CANADA AVIATION MUSEUM AIRCRAFT. PIASECKI (VERTOL) HUP-3 (RETRIEVER). ROYAL CANADIAN NAVY (RCN). http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/assets/pdf/e_PiaseckiHUP-3.pdf  Construction  State of the art when designed, their hull was of unprecedented strength and structural integrity. The outer hull plating was constructed with 1-5/8 inch thick high tensile steel and they had a double bottom above the waterline with the two \\"skins\\" being approximately 15 inches apart, insulated with cork. Framing was closely spaced and the entire hull was designed for great strength. With a relatively short length in proportion to the great power developed, their bow had the characteristic sloping forefoot that enabled her to ride up on heavy ice and break it with the weight of the vessel. Their stern was similarly shaped to facilitate breaking ice while backing down. The sides of the icebreaker were rounded, with marked tumblehome, that enabled the ship to break free from ice by heeling from side to side. Such heeling was accomplished by shifting water rapidly from wing tanks on one side of the ship to the other. A total of 220 tons of water could be shifted from one side to the other in as little as 90 seconds, which induced a list of 10 degrees. Ballast could also be shifted rapidly between fore and aft tanks to change the trim of the ship. Diesel electric machinery was chosen for its controllability and resistance to damage, and they were fitted with a removable front propeller used to create a wash to clear ice.  General characteristics  (as originally fitted during World War II) * Builder: Western Pipe and Steel Company (WPS) San Pedro, California * Power Plant: six Fairbanks Morse diesel engines at 2000 Bhp each, powering 3 electric propulsion motors. Two screws aft, one forward, (the bow screw was detachable and seldom used; it was not primarily used for propulsion, but rather, was used to help break through the ice; by causing a wash and thus clearing away the broken ice). * Length: 269 ft (82 m) * Beam: 63.5 ft (19.4 m) * Displacement: approx 6,515 tons full load (fl) * Speed: 16.8 knots ( km/h) * Ice capability: 13 foot ice * Aircraft: 1 Grumman J2F Duck seaplane * Cost: about $10 million USD each * Service Life: An estimated 20 years * Crew: 21 officers, 295 enlisted as built; (after World War II, the U.S. vessels of the Wind-class had their armament gradually reduced, which also reduced their complements) * Armament: Four 5-inch/38 (127 mm) dual purpose guns (2 twin turrets). Twelve 40 mm/60 AA guns (3 quadruple turrets). Six 20 mm/80 AA; Y-guns. Two depth charge racks. One Hedgehog launcher. M2 Browning machine guns and small arms. Due to being ordered during the war the first five U.S. built Wind-class icebreakers were heavily armed for ships of their size. Northwind/Staten Island (WAG 278) armament reduced to four single 3\\"50cal. and eight single 40mm. for Soviet service. Weapons systems were gradually removed, and by 1970 all that remained were M2 Browning machine guns, M60 machine guns, and small arms for law enforcement purposes. * Dates Deployed:1942 to 1989  U.S. Ship Numbers  Initially, the ships of the Wind-class carried the designation of either WAG for Coast Guard, Auxiliary, General, or, (the U.S. Navy) AGB for Auxiliary, General, Breaker. In 1949 all U.S. Coast Guard WAGs were redesignated WAGBs for Coast Guard, Auxiliary, General, Breaker. During 1965 and 1966, all U.S. Navy icebreakers were transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard. NB: The two Northwinds referenced below are not to be confused with one another. *The USCGC Staten Island (WAG-278) was built as Northwind (WAG-278), commissioned as Staten Island (WAG-278) and immediately sent to the U.S.S.R. under lend-lease. Upon return she was USS Northwind (AGB-5) for less than three months, then renamed USS Staten Island (AGB-5) to avoid confusion with USCGC Northwind (WAG-282), and finally renamed USCGC Staten Island (WAGB-278). *The USCGC Eastwind (WAG-279) was redesignated USCGC Eastwind (WAGB-279). *The USCGC Southwind (WAG-280) on return from U.S.S.R Lend-Lease service was renamed USS Atka (AGB-3), and later renamed, USCGC Southwind (WAGB-280). *The USCGC Westwind (WAG281) on return from U.S.S.R. Lend-Lease service was named USS Westwind (AGB-6) and later renamed USCGC Westwind (WAGB-281). *The USCGC Northwind (WAG-282) was redesignated USCGC Northwind (WAGB-282). *The USS Burton Island (AGB-88) was redesignated USS Burton Island (AGB-1) and then renamed USCGC Burton Island (WAGB-283). *The USS Edisto (AGB-89) was redesignated USS Edisto (AGB-2), and finally renamed USCGC Edisto (WAGB-284). For Canada's Wind-class icebreaker, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) assigned Pendant Number AW 50 to the Canadian-built HMCS Labrador. Labrador served in RCN from 1954 to 1957. Labrador was then transferred to Department of Transport (DOT), recommissioned Canadian Government Ship (CGS) Labrador serving 1958 to 1962. She was again transferred to the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and recommissioned CCGS Labrador, serving from 1962 to 1987. Labrador was not fitted with any weapons systems. Labrador possessed all the general characteristics of her American-built sister ships, but was much improved with state-of-the-art gear at the time (1951). Labrador was the only Canadian Wind- class icebreaker to be constructed, and also the last of the Wind-class to be built.

These were to have been the Canadian equivalents to BBC Two in the United Kingdom, itself the second television channel of the BBC.  History  In the late 1970s CBC-SRC created a plan that would make two additional channels available to Canada's 3.5 million cable subscribers. These two channels, CBC-2 and Tele-2, would have potentially bumped US commercial stations carried on the cable system, because at the time, there was a lack of extra channel capacity on most cable systems. The CBC-SRC made a formal application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in August 1980 for a licence to create a network that would replay programming in English and French (T√©l√©-2), with the formal hearing taking place over three days, beginning on January 14, 1981. The two new services would commence broadcasting in January 1982. In response to the application, the CRTC received 82 interventions, of which 25 individuals or organizations would make in-person presentations. Among those opposed to the creation of the networks were Canwest Broadcasting (owners of CKND-TV), four Progressive Conservative MPs, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB), B.C Television Broadcasting System Ltd., and the Ontario government. Among the supporters of the application were various arts groups. The networks would air Monday thru Friday between 6:45 pm and 11:05 pm. On weekends the schedule would air between 6:30 pm and 11:30 pm. Operational costs in the first year for both networks would be C$27.5‚Äì30 million. The corporation had proposed that CBC-2 would: * be non-commercial * be a basic, must-carry service * feature programming from CBC and provincial educational broadcasters * feature regional programming broadcast to a national audience * feature arts and culture, drama, news  License denial  In CRTC Decision 81-353,CRTC Decision 81-353 (May 27, 1981).

Born in Oakdale, Massachusetts, he played for eight teams during his 18-year career. He made his major-league debut in 1888 and retired as a player after the 1905 season. He then entered coaching, ran a hotel and became a deputy U.S. marshal. Career Farrell had a career year in 1891 with the Boston Reds of the American Association, batting .302 and recording league-leading home run (12) and RBI (110) totals. Farrell's 12 home runs were nearly a quarter of his career total. In a 1900 game for Brooklyn, Farrell was an unwitting party to an argument between a player and umpire that resulted in a forfeit being awarded to Brooklyn. On a close play at home plate, umpire John Gaffney called Farrell safe. St. Louis catcher Wilbert Robinson reacted angrily to Gaffney's call, throwing the ball at the umpire and punching him in the chest. Gaffney ejected Robinson and then awarded a forfeit to Brooklyn when Robinson would not leave the playing field. A 1913 newspaper article said that Farrell was widely recognized among old-time baseball men as the best-dressed man in the game. Over an 18-season career, Farrell hit .277 in 1,565 games with 1,572 hits in 5,682 at bats with 52 homers and 916 RBI. =A false record= For over a century, it was incorrectly believed that Farrell held the single-game major league record for most baserunners thrown out attempting to steal by a catcher, at eight; this record supposedly was set during a game on May 11, 1897. However, in 2016, research done by Society for American Baseball Research writer Brian Marshall revealed that while Farrell did have eight assists in that game, he actually threw out \\"only\\" five would-be basestealers. Later life Farrell served as a deputy U.S. marshal after his playing career. He also managed a hotel in Marlboro, Massachusetts. In 1910 and 1911, Farrell was a coach for the New York Yankees. He coached for the Boston Red Sox in 1912 and then became a scout for a couple of years before rejoining the Yankees as a pitching coach in 1915. In the early 1920s, he became a coach and scout for the Boston Braves. He died in Boston in 1925, ten days after undergoing abdominal surgery. He was buried at Immaculate Conception Cemetery in Marlborough, Massachusetts, aged 58.

The vessels were also equipped with an eight-berth hospital, sick bay, X-ray room, medical lab, dental clinic and lab.Blackman (1966), p. 40 Service history =Royal Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy= The ship was ordered by the Royal Navy during the Second World War as a modified Fort ship design and was laid down on 8 June 1944 by Burrard Dry Dock at their Vancouver shipyard. Beachy Head was launched on 27 September 1944 and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 20 March 1945. After short service with the Royal Navy, the vessel was loaned to the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1947 for use as a repair ship and renamed Vulkaan.

The ship lay alongside in Halifax, Nova Scotia used as classroom ship and providing auxiliary services in the harbour. The ship was sent for a refit at Saint John, New Brunswick and commissioned on 28 January 1959. In January 1960, the ship deployed to Bermuda as headquarters ship for the Canadian warships from Atlantic Command performing naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea during the winter months. During the deployment, Cape Scott transported six Sikorsky H04S and one Bell helicopters to Bermuda.Kealy and Russell, p. 62 She returned to Halifax in March. In October 1960, Cape Scott took part in the NATO naval exercise Sweep Clear V off Shelburne, Nova Scotia. In 1964 Cape Scott was engaged in a civilian medical mission to Rapa Nui in the south Pacific Ocean, called the Medical Expedition to Easter Island (METEI). Carrying nearly 40 doctors and technicians and 20 prefabricated shelters, Cape Scott was refitted to increase fuel capacity from 4,441 to 9,000 barrels, and enlarge the forward hatch to handle large cargoes. The ship was homeported at Halifax until paid off into reserve on 1 July 1970. In 1972, the ship was redesignated Fleet Maintenance Group (Atlantic) and remained as such until 1975, when the group was moved ashore.

He was an early Western traveller within the Chinese mainland, and the author of numerous works on Asian fauna, flora and geography. The first European Chinese dictionary, published in 1670, is attributed to Boym.  Biography  Drawings of Chinese fruit trees from Michael Boym's \\"Briefve Relation de la Chine\\" (Paris, 1654). Depicted are the Cinnamomum cassia, the durian, and a variety of banana (or plantain) tree, with their Chinese names. Micha≈Ç Boym was born in Lw√≥w, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine), around 1614, to a well-off family of Hungarian ancestry. His grandfather Jerzy Boim came to Poland from Hungary with the king Stefan Batory, and married Jadwiga Ni≈ºniowska.R√≥d Boim√≥w (The Boim Family) Micha≈Ç's father, Pawe≈Ç Jerzy Boim (1581‚Äì1641), was a physician to King Sigismund III of Poland. Out of Pawel Jerzy's six sons, the eldest, the ne'er-do-well Jerzy was disinherited; Miko≈Çaj and Jan became merchants; Pawe≈Ç, a doctor; while Micha≈Ç and Benedykt Pawe≈Ç joined the Society of Jesus. The family had their own family chapel in Lviv's central square, which was constructed around the time of Micha≈Ç's birth. In 1631, Boym joined the Jesuits in Krak√≥w, and was ordained a priest. In 1643, after almost a decade of intensive studies in the monasteries of Krak√≥w, Kalisz, Jaros≈Çaw and Sandomierz, Boym embarked on a voyage to Eastern Asia. He first traveled to Rome, where he obtained a blessing for his mission from Pope Urban VIII, and then proceeded to Lisbon. Later that year he embarked with a group of nine other priests and clerics on a voyage to Portuguese Goa, and then Macau. Initially he taught at St. Paul Jesuit College (Macau). He then moved to the island of Hainan, where he opened a small Catholic mission. After the island had been conquered by the Manchus, Boym had to flee to Tonkin in 1647. Even as Jesuits in northern and central China were successfully switching their loyalties from the fallen Ming Dynasty to the newly established Qing, the Jesuits in the south of the country continued to work with the Ming loyalist regimes still controlling some of the region. Accordingly, in 1649 Boym was sent by the Canton-based Vice-Provincial of the China Mission Alvaro Semedo with a diplomatic mission to the court of the Yongli Emperor, the last Chinese ruler of the Ming Dynasty, still controlling parts of the Southwestern China. As the Yongli regime was endangered by the encroaching Manchus, the Jesuit Andreas Wolfgang Koffler, who had been at the Yongli court since 1645, had succeeded in converting many of the members of the imperial family to Christianity believing this would attract help from Western monarchs for the Southern Ming's struggle to continue to rule China. Among the Christians at the Yongli's court were Empress dowager Helena Wang (Wang Liena), the wife of the emperor's father; Empress dowager Maria Ma (Ma Maliya), the mother of the emperor; and the heir to the throne, prince Constantine (Dangding), Zhu Cuxuan. The Emperor's eunuch secretary Pang Tianshou (ÈæêÂ§©Â£Ω), known by his Christian name Achilles, had become a Christian as well, years earlier. Andreas Wolfgang Koffler in The Dictionary of the Ming Biography, pp. 722-723 Boym was chosen to present the situation of the Chinese Emperor to the Pope. He received letters from Empress dowager Helena and from Pang Achilles, to give to Pope Innocent X, the General of the Jesuit Order,The Superior General at the time was Francisco Piccolomini. Mungello. p. 139, as well as the Dictionary of the Ming Biography (article on Andreas Wolfgang Koffler, pp. 722-723) give the addressee's name as Goswin Nickel. but it is likely that at the time of writing the Empress and the eunuch ‚Äì or Boym himself ‚Äì would not know that by the time of the letter's arrival to Rome Piccolomini will have died and Goswin will have become (in March 1652) the Superior General of the order. and Cardinal John de Lugo. Additional letters were dispatched to the Doge of Venice and to the King of Portugal. Together with a young court official named Andrew Zheng (), \\"Micha≈Ç Piotr Boym\\" in the Dictionary of the Ming Biography, pp. 20-21Cheng An-te-lo in Wade-Giles transcription. He is known also by his Christian name of Andrew Sin Boym embarked on his return voyage to Europe. They arrived at Goa in May 1651, where they learned that the King of Portugal had already abandoned the cause of the Chinese (Southern Ming) Emperor, and that Boym's mission was seen as a possible threat to future relations with the victorious Manchu. This view was also supported by the new local superior of the Jesuits, who believed the Jesuit Order should not interfere in the internal power struggles of China. Boym was placed under house arrest. However, he managed to escape and continue his voyage on foot. By way of Hyderabad, Surat, Bander Abbas and Shiraz, he arrived at Isfahan, in Persia. From there he continued his journey to Erzerum, Trabzon and ƒ∞zmir, where he arrived near the end of August 1652. As the Venetian court was having conflicts with the Jesuits, Boym discarded his habit and dressed up as a Chinese Mandarin, before he arrived in Venice in December of that year. Although he had managed to cross uncharted waters and unknown lands, his mission there would not be easy, as the political intrigues at the European courts proved to be extremely complicated. Initially the Doge of Venice refused to grant Boym an audience, as Venice wanted to maintain a neutral stance in regards to China. Boym managed to convince the French ambassador to support his cause, and the Doge finally saw Boym and accepted the letter. However, the French involvement caused a negative reaction from the Pope, as Innocent X was actively opposed to France and its ambitions. Also the newly elected General of the Jesuits, Gosvinus Nickel, believed Boym's mission might endanger other Jesuit missions in China and other parts of the world. A new Pope was elected in 1655, and after three years, Alexander VII finally saw Boym on 18 December 1655. However, although Alexander was sympathetic to the Ming dynasty and its dilemma, he could not offer any practical help and his letter to the Chinese emperor contained little but words of empathy and offers of prayers. However, the letter from the new Pope opened many doors for Boym and his mission. In Lisbon, he was granted an audience by King John IV, who promised to help the Chinese struggle with military force. In March 1656, Boym started his return trip to China. Out of eight priests accompanying him, only four survived the journey. Upon reaching Goa it turned out that Yongli's situation was dire and that the local Portuguese administration, despite direct orders from the monarch, did not want to let Boym travel to Macau. This was in order not to compromise their commercial enterprises with the victorious Manchu. Boym again ignored the Portuguese monopoly by travelling on foot, this time by an uncharted route to Ayutthaya, the capital of Siam. He arrived there in early 1658, and hired a ship from pirates, with which he sailed to northern Vietnam. In Hanoi, Boym tried to procure a guide to lead him and the priests travelling with him to Yunnan. However, he was unsuccessful and he had to continue the journey alone, with the assistance only of Chang, who had travelled with him all the way to Europe and back. They reached the Chinese province of Guangxi, but on 22 June 1659 Boym died, having failed to reach the emperor's court. The burial place remains unknown.  Works  A squirrel (ÊùæÈº†) chasing a green-haired turtle (Á∂†ÊØõÈæú), in Boym's Flora Sinensis Boym is best remembered for his works describing the flora, fauna, history, traditions and customs of the countries he travelled through. During his first trip to China he wrote a short work on the plants and animals dwelling in Mozambique. The work was later sent to Rome, but was never printed. During his return trip he prepared a large collection of maps of mainland China and South-East Asia. He planned to expand it to nine chapters describing China, its customs and political system, as well as Chinese science and inventions. The merit of Boym's maps was that they were the first European maps to properly represent Korea as a peninsula rather than an island. They also took notice of the correct positions of many Chinese cities previously unknown to the westerners or known only by the semi-fabulous descriptions of Marco Polo. Boym also marked the Great Wall and the Gobi Desert. Although the collection was not published during Boym's lifetime,It was published in 1661 under the title of Mappa Imperii Sinarum... (\\"Map of the Chinese Empire\\") it extended the knowledge of China in the west. The best known of Boym's works is the Flora Sinensis (\\"Chinese Flora\\"), published in Vienna in 1656. The book was the first description of an ecosystem of the Far East published in Europe. Boym underlined the medicinal properties of the Chinese plants. The book also included pleas for support of the Catholic Chinese emperor and a poem containing nearly a hundred chronograms pointing to the date of 1655, the date of coronation of Emperor Leopold I as the King of Hungary, as Boym wanted to gain support of that monarch for his mission. Athanasius Kircher heavily drew on the Flora Sinensis for the chapters on the plants and animals of China in his celebrated China Illustrata (1667). Boym authored the first published Chinese dictionary for a European language, a Chinese‚ÄìFrench dictionary published in the first French edition of Kircher's work, in 1670. In his other works, such as Specimen medicinae Sinicae (\\"Chinese medicinal plants\\") and Clavis medica ad Chinarum doctrinam de pulsibus (\\"Key to the Medical Doctrine of the Chinese on the Pulse\\") he described the Chinese traditional medicine and introduced several methods of healing and diagnostics previously unknown in Europe, particularly measurement of the pulse. The latter book was likely written by the Dutch doctor and scholar Willem ten Rhijne.Harold J Cook, Matters of Exchange, Yale University Press 2007; pp 349-377.

He was the first president of Wells Fargo & Company, founder of the United States Express Company, and director of American Express Company. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York and served for three terms. Early life and education Edwin Barber Morgan was born in Aurora, New York, the eldest son of Christopher and Nancy (Barber) Morgan. Educated at the Cayuga Lake Academy, Morgan became a clerk in his father's mercantile enterprise at 13, and at 21 he took over the business. Christopher Morgan was Edwin's brother, Lewis H. Morgan his cousin and Noyes Barber his uncle. He was a first cousin of Edwin Denison Morgan, governor of New York in 1859‚Äì1862. Marriage and family On September 27, 1829, Morgan married Charlotte Fidelia Wood of Aurora.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 168. The couple were the parents of a son, Alonzo and two daughters, Louise F. and Katharine. Career Morgan soon established a large enterprise in buying and shipping agricultural products, and also in boat-building, in which he was joined by his brothers. With his brothers, he also had extensive gypsum beds in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and a starch-making business at Oswego, New York.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 167. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1934. In addition to his business career, Morgan was active in the New York Militia as inspector of the 2nd Division, which included units from Cayuga, Wayne, Ontario, Yates, Tompkins, and Seneca Counties. According to New York's 1827 militia law, each division was authorized an inspector at the rank of colonel, and each brigade an inspector at the rank of major; from this military service, Morgan derived the title \\"Colonel\\" Morgan, by which he was known even after he was no longer active in the militia. He was a director and first president of Wells Fargo & Company, organized March 18, 1852, by his fellow townsman Henry Wells, who had been a founder of the American Express Company in 1850. Wells Fargo was developed specifically to offer express mail, shipping and banking services to California, where thousands of people were being drawn as the Gold Rush spurred migration and development. In 1854 Morgan founded the United States Express Company to provide similar express mail services for the Southern states. It connected with Wells Fargo at St. Louis, Missouri. Also, from about this time until his death in 1881, Morgan was a director of American Express. By the time Morgan became involved, American Express had its headquarters in Manhattan.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 167.Noel M. Loomis, Wells Fargo, pp. 15‚Äì16, 113, 155. New York: Clarkson N. Potter, Inc. Morgan was first nominated for a seat in Congress in 1850, but he was defeated by 14 votes. Morgan was elected to Congress in 1852 as a Whig, in 1854 as an Opposition Party candidate, and in 1856 as a Republican. He represented New York's 25th congressional district from March 4, 1853 until March 3, 1859. In 1855‚Äì1856 he was chairman of the Committee on Patents. Morgan was one of the members of Congress who rescued Charles Sumner from the assault by Preston Brooks on May 22, 1856.Dictionary of American Biography, op. cit. Early in his Congressional service, Morgan resigned as president of Wells Fargo but remained a member of the board of directors. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1858. On July 20, 1858, he resigned his seat on the Wells Fargo board, and N.H. Stockwell was elected to succeed him. In November 1858, however, Thomas M. Janes resigned, and Morgan was again elected to the board.Loomis, pp. 42, 139. Later years During the American Civil War, Morgan was active in raising and equipping regiments from New York. In the postwar period, he became active with colleges. He was a trustee of Cornell University from 1865 until 1874. Working with his friend Henry Wells to found a college for women, he was a charter trustee of Wells College from 1868 until 1881, where he served as president of the board from 1878 onward. He was also a trustee of the Auburn Theological Seminary from 1870 to 1881. He supported the secondary school of Cayuga Lake Academy in Aurora as well.Dictionary of American Biography, op. cit. Morgan was a director of Wells Fargo until the beginning of 1867.Loomis, pp. 189, 197. After a brief retirement, he was elected to the board in 1868 and served until 1870.Loomis, pp. 201, 212, 215. An original shareholder of The New York Times, Morgan came to the paper's rescue in the midst of its fight against William Magear Tweed in 1871. George Jones, the editor, feared that ownership of the paper would pass into unfriendly hands. For $375,000, Morgan purchased enough stock to avert this, and contributed materially to Tweed's eventual downfall.Dictionary of American Biography, op. cit.

The title refers to the main protagonist, whose name is Johnny and is an agent of the elite \\"Raygun Agency.\\" The comic's first publication was in 2003, and has largely been a quarterly publication. The eponymous hero is actually named John Kurtzberg, a nod to famed comic book creator Jack Kirby. In Johnny's fictional universe, \\"Raygun\\" is a shortened vernacular term for \\"Raygun Agent,\\" thus creating the title of the book. The book pays homage to the style of classic science fiction stories such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, and also Jonny Quest and Silver Age Marvel comics. The book pokes fun at this subculture, although it does not focus exclusively on parody. There is a serious, serialized sci-fi adventure story running just below the book's jokes and pop culture references. Creation and Publication History Johnny Raygun the character was created and developed by Rich Woodall, a New Hampshire based illustrator and comic book artist. The character first appeared in Cygnus X2 #2 in 1994, published by Twisted Pearl Press, and later became the star of a short-lived webcomic. However, the series itself didn't take off until Woodall met Matt Talbot, a like-minded individual. Woodall and Talbot began scripting a short story for the character in 2002 that was set to appear in a local comic anthology of short stories. The anthology's publication fell through, and the duo ultimately published the story as an ashcan preview in time for the 2002 Boston, MA Comic Con. Positive attention at the convention spurred an interest in expanding the character, and the Johnny Raygun publication was born, beginning with Johnny Raygun: Special Edition, which reprinted the original ashcan story plus a few backups, and then progressing to quarterly issues featuring full-length stories. Woodall and Talbot plot and script the book together. Woodall then pencils, and Talbot inks and letters the book. The book has had some noteworthy attention, and has had cover art drawn by comic greats such as Erik Larsen, Michael Avon Oeming, and Ed McGuinness. Characters =The Raygun Agency and its allies= The Raygun Agency is an intergalactic law enforcement organization, fielding a staff of Agents who come from all walks of life, including planets other than earth. The Agency is a cross between a sci-fi police station and the Green Lantern corps. It is set in a futurized present alternate universe. * Johnny Raygun: Actually named John Kurtzberg, he is the central character of the series. A relatively new Raygun Agent, Johnny is excitable, ambitious, and occasionally overzealous. He is a capable field agent, but there is nothing to indicate he is special in any way, except for his devotion to his job. He has a penchant for fast food hamburgers, video games, and comic books. A running joke in the series involves other characters poking fun at Johnny's haircut, which was partially inspired by a haircut Woodall himself wore during his high school years. Johnny's exact age is unknown, but it's implied that at this point in the series, Johnny is in his early twenties. He has a younger sister who has electric-based superpowers. Johnny is based in part on Flash Gordon and Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker. * Amy Oni: A young starlet/socialite in the Raygun universe, she is the daughter of wealthy industrialist Stavros Sartan. It is unclear as to what she is actually famous for, other than being the heiress to a fortune, implying that she is partially a parody of real-life celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Nicky Hilton, and Stavros Niarchos III. Johnny was assigned to Oni as her bodyguard, and the two began a relationship. She is currently Johnny's girlfriend. Amy is tall, slender, and fashionably dressed, with a blonde bob usually held in place with a hairband. =Recurring and Minor Characters= * H2Olaf: An aquatic, extraterrestrial agent who wears a glass bubble on his head filled with freshwater (he cannot breathe in salt water or air). H2Olaf has a Type A personality, and his meticulously by-the- book work ethic often conflicts with Johnny's more relaxed and carefree approach to his job. This often leads to humorous and sometimes disastrous situations when the two are paired up for assignments. H2Olaf is a partial spoof of Abe Sapien from the comic book Hellboy. First appearance: Johnny Raygun One Shot #1 * Dirk Squarejaw: Dirk is Johnny's direct supervisor, and the head of the Raygun Field Agents. He was also the original Adventure Kid, sidekick to Dr. Oog. Dirk may not agree with all of Johnny's methods, but he still appreciates a job well done. Though he's now primarily behind the desk, Dirk is still known to kick a butt or two if the need arises. First appearance: Johnny Raygun Quarterly #1 * Kane Grist: One of Johnny's friends in the Agency. Kane is an everyman character who is often teamed up with Johnny and H2Olaf. He has a laid-back demeanor and an unusually high tolerance for Johnny's quirks and tangents, most likely stemming from their friendship in the Raygun Academy. Kane specializes in detective work. First appearance: Johnny Raygun Special Edition #1 * Iss: One of Johnny's friends in the Agency. Iss is an attractive redhead who gives Johnny dating advice. Their relationship seems to be strictly platonic. * Mike Rage: A \\"super-agent\\" who works for the Raygun Agency on a freelance basis. Mike Rage is everything Johnny is not‚Äîhandsome, dashing, highly trained, and extremely arrogant. He takes every opportunity to insult Johnny's mom. Mike Rage wears a customized Raygun Agent style uniform. * Dr. Oog: Once merely a caveman, Dr. Oog was thrust into the 20th century by an unattended time machine. His brain became super-evolved, and he is now the universe's smartest man. Dr. Oog is a super- scientist in the vein of Dr. Benton Quest, Lex Luthor, and most notably Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four. Dr. Oog frequently travels with his wife, Janet, whom he belittles mercilessly, and his son Nathan, an adventurous preteen in the mold of Jonny Quest. Dr. Oog has a tremendous chip on his shoulder and is always depicted as irritated by everything. His constant belittling of his wife, Janet, is a spoof on the way Reed Richards was written in the Silver Age when interacting with his wife, the Invisible Woman. First appearance: Johnny Raygun Quarterly #1 =Villains= * The Salamander: Real name, Sal Salinsky. The Salamander's origin is an amalgamation of many popular comic book characters' origin stories. This is a spoof of characters with complicated origins in and of itself. * Mr. Hypothermia: The son of Russian scientists, he was involved in an atomic lab accident that left him with the ability to create and control ice and snow. He was then raised by siberian wolves. First appearance: Johnny Raygun Classics #1 * Darkmind: A hulking behemoth who can steal other characters' superpowers. He is always accompanied by a diminutive sidekick character named Ralph who rides on his back. Ralph seems to be partly inspired by Salacious Crumb. * Tiki Monkey: Born a normal ape, Tiki Monkey was captured by tourists, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt, and forced to entertain guests at a karaoke bar. He broke free and ran to the nearby jungle, stumbled upon a tiki mask, and was granted powers from the tiki gods. Tiki Monkey now has an oath to destroy tourism and karaoke bars, wherever they may be. He is a partial spoof of The Mask. First appearance: Johnny Raygun Classics #1 * The Mighty Moog: The Moog race is a group of sentient, lava-like organisms, originally from Venus. The organism that went by the name The Mighty Moog was captured on Venus, taken to Earth, and put on display in a circus sideshow. First appearance: Johnny Raygun Quarterly #1 * Johnny Anomalous: Johnny's evil twin from a parallel universe, Johnny Anomalous is a dimension-hopping fiend who travels through Anomalous Holes (a fictional type of wormhole), assassinating his parallel selves. He also goes by the nickname \\"Johnny A-Hole.\\" * The Electolucha: There are two villains named The Electrolucha. One is obese, one is very thin, and both are Caucasian. However, both have electric superpowers. Due to a mix-up with a Supervillain branding/marketing agency, both characters wound up with the same name and costume. Rather than letting this deter their fiendish ideas, however, they instead decided to team up and work together for a common cause.

According to the US Treasury, \\"The Global Relief Foundation (GRF) ‚Ä¶ and its officers and directors have connections to, and have provided support for and assistance to, Osama bin Laden (OBL), al Qaeda (aQ), and other known terrorist groups (OKTG).\\" It was one of the few organizations registered with the Taliban.  Mission  GRF described itself as a not-for profit, non-governmental organization established to provide humanitarian and charitable relief to Muslims in conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmir, and Lebanon. In addition to undertaking charitable work, however, GRF served as an organization issuing propaganda for global jihad. The magazine, Al Thilal, published by the GRF, did not spread messages of a humanitarian organization but rather served as anti-American and Anti-Semitic propaganda, calling for jihad throughout the world, especially in Palestine, Bosnia, and Kashmir.  History  The GRF began operations in the United States as a tax-exempt, non- profit, charitable organization in 1992 and quickly became the largest Islamic charity in the U.S. The organization initially had a budget of $700,000. By the end of the 1990 GRF was reporting $5 million in annual donations, and 90% of that money was shipped abroad. Some materials distributed by GRF at this time glorify martyrdom through jihad and state that donations will be used to support the Mujahedin. GRF had overseas offices in Islamabad, Pakistan; Brussels, Belgium; Sarajevo, Bosnia; Zagreb, Croatia; and Baku, Azerbaijan. The FBI started investigating GRF prior to 9/11 on the basis that it supported radical Islamic interests like that of al-Qaeda. In 2000, FBI agents found that while a majority of the funding from GRF goes to legitimate relief organizations, a significant amount goes to terrorist groups like the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, and Kashmiri Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami in addition to Al-Qaeda. The FBI reported that there were two types of donors to GRF, those that thought they were donating to humanitarian causes and a select few who knew that the purpose of their donations was to support global jihad. After 9/11, the U.S. Government froze GRF's assets and started a criminal investigation into its activities; the government arrested and ultimately deported GRF's chief executive, Rabih Haddad. The FBI and Treasury Department have asserted links between Global Chevra Foundation founder Rabih Haddad and Makhtab al- Khidamat.Mintz, John US Labels Muslim Charity as Terrorist Group; Treasury Cites Ties to... Washington Post, October 19, 2002 Makhtab al-Khidamat was founded by Osama bin Laden's mentor Abdullah Azzam.

Sayadi maintains that any contact with El-Hage was \\"absolutely innocent.\\" Haddad was arrested by the INS on immigration charges when the group's offices were raided, and later deported to Lebanon.Roxane Assaf (March 2002), Global Relief Foundation assets seized as Chairman is arrested on visa violation, Washington Report on Middle East AffairsCAIR and Terrorism, July 23, 2004 Lawyers representing the organisation accused the US government of a \\"disregard for civil rights and constitutional rights\\" in the wake of 9/11 and believed the connection between Global Relief and terrorism to be \\"weak\\", criticised the \\"guilty by association\\" policy and the use of \\"secret evidence rules\\" granted under the Patriot Act. Supporters of the foundation claimed that it was unfairly targeted, denied due process and closed before any evidence linking it to terrorism had been produced. According to the Treasury Department, GRF helped fund a number of al Qaeda- sponsored activities, including bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and armed action against groups perceived to be un-Islamic. Global Relief sued the Treasury Department for release of its assets in January 2002. GRF sought redress in Federal court, challenging the government's authority to shut the charity down and seeking an injunction to stop the seizure of its money and assets. On December 31, 2002, the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reverse the Treasury seizure.U.S. Circuit Court 315 F.3d 748, Global Relief Foundation, Inc, v. Paul H. O'Neill, Secretary of the Treasury, et al. In November 2001, the GRF sued The New York Times, the Associated Press, ABC, and The Boston Globe for defamation after various news outlets reported on GRF ties to terror financing and fundraising. Lawyers for Global Relief sued a number of news organizations for libel for publishing FBI and Justice Department charges. The suit was dismissed by the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on December 1, 2004. The court's opinion stated that \\"All of the reports were either true or substantially true recitations of the government's suspicions about and actions against GRF.\\" In 2004, a federal appeals court found that the GRF's case against these media outlets was without merit.  Terrorist activity  According to the U.S. Treasury, a set of photographs and negatives discovered in 1997 in a trash dumpster outside of GRF's office in Illinois depicts large shipping boxes displayed under a GRF banner. The boxes were full of sophisticated communications equipment, including approximately 200 handheld radio transceivers, long-range radio antennas, and portable power packs, with an estimated total value of $120,000. Other photographs depict fighters armed with automatic rifles, a sand bagged bunker with a radio antenna mounted outside, and mutilated corpses with the name \\"KPI\\" (Kashmir Press International) printed alongside. Yet another photograph displays two dead men with the caption \\"Hizbul Mujahideen,\\" a known terrorist organization operating in the Kashmir region. On the reverse side of the photograph was handwritten in Arabic, \\"two martyrs killed by the Indian government.\\" GRF has stocked and promoted audio tapes and books which glorify armed jihad, including \\"The international conspiracy against Jihad\\" and \\"The Jihad in its present stage.\\" GRF published several Arabic newsletters and pamphlets that advocate armed action through jihad against groups perceived to be un-Islamic. For example, one 1995 GRF pamphlet reads \\"God equated martyrdom through JIHAD with supplying funds for the JIHAD effort. All contributions should be mailed to: GRF.\\" Another GRF newsletter requested donations \\"for God's cause ‚Äì they [the Zakat funds] are disbursed for equipping the raiders, for the purchase of ammunition and food, and for their [the Mujahideen's] transportation so that they can raise God the Almighty's word . . . it is likely that the most important of disbursement of Zakat in our times is on the jihad for God's cause . . . .\\" In November 2001, during the airstrikes in Afghanistan, a GRF medical relief coordinator traveled to Kabul, against the advice of the U.S. Department of State, and engaged in dealings and negotiations with Taliban officials until the collapse of the Taliban regime. GRF received $18,521 from the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (HLF) in 2000. HLF, a Dallas, Texas-based Islamic charitable organization, was designated under E.O. 13224 on December 4, 2001, and under the European Union's Regulation (EC) No. 2580/2001 on June 17, 2002, for its ties to terrorism.

He is, however, best known as one of the co-authors of After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s, a strategy for the LGBT movement in the 1990s.  Background  Kirk was born in Norway, Maine, the third child of Roger Marchant and Kathleen Marie (Murphy) Kirk, and was raised in Mechanic Falls. Marshall had two brothers, Roger and Douglas, and a sister, Kathy. Growing up Kirk took interest in weather; his brothers report that at age 10 his fellow townsmen in Mechanic Falls, Maine, preferred his forecasts to anything on television. He was valedictorian of his high school class and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1980, majoring in psychology, and writing his honors thesis on the testing of gifted children.  Genealogical research  His interest in his own colonial New England forebears broadened into the study of pre-American ancestry. He became internationally known as one of the three or four major American authorities on medieval and ancient genealogy (Greece, Rome, Egypt, Persia, Armenia, the Merovingians and Carolingians). Writing sometimes under his own name and at other times under the pseudonym \\"Kenneth W. Kirkpatrick\\", he authored or co-authored several articles in the NEGHS Register and also wrote for the New Hampshire Genealogical Record, Vermont Genealogist and The Island Magazine. His accumulation of arguments to \\"build a case\\" for speculative identifications in the near English ancestry of New England immigrants was widely perceived as brilliant, and he published such pieces on the five Winslow brothers and Thomas Bradbury in the NEGHS Register (the second article published 2007) and on John Cotton in the last 1999 issue of The New Hampshire Genealogical Record. His research on Gov. Thomas Dudley was used by both Doug Richardson in Plantagenet Ancestry and in The Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants (RD600) by Gary Boyd Roberts. Marshall was especially pleased by the prospect of an Edward III descent through Katherine Deighton (Dudley's second wife), Dennis and Stradling, and after publication of an article in Foundations attempting to refute it, was strong in its defense. Marshall also contributed to the fourth edition (1999) of the Genealogist‚Äôs Handbook for New England Research, the CD-ROM edition of Clarence A. Torrey's New England Marriages Prior to 1700, and John A. Schutz, Legislators of the Massachusetts General Court, 1691‚Äì1780: A Biographical Dictionary (1997). He was associate editor of The Mayflower Descendant from 2002 to 2003.  Gay rights activism  In 1987 Kirk partnered with Hunter Madsen (writing under the pen-name \\"Erastes Pill\\") to write an essay, \\"The Overhauling of Straight America\\", which was published in Guide magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans \\"to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders\\". Then \\"your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won\\". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the ‚Äô90s. The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Time and The Washington Post. The book is often critically described by social conservatives as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged \\"homosexual agenda\\". The conservative Christian group Focus on the Family claim that, > It is an agenda that they basically set in the late 1980s, in a book called > 'After the Ball,' where they laid out a six-point plan for how they could > transform the beliefs of ordinary Americans with regard to homosexual > behavior ‚Äî in a decade-long time frame.... They admit it privately, but they > will not say that publicly. In their private publications, homosexual > activists make it very clear that there is an agenda. The six-point agenda > that they laid out in 1989 was explicit: Talk about gays and gayness as > loudly and as often as possible... Portray gays as victims, not as > aggressive challengers... Give homosexual protectors a just cause... (to > exploit the sense of fairness)... Make gays look good... Make the > victimizers look bad... Get funds from corporate America. Health Kirk suffered from severe migraine headaches that were preceded by a strong desire to talk in a rapid monologue. He found that if he gave into these \\"babbling fits\\", the headache would be alleviated. He had other medical problems and suffered from bouts of depression that required electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on three occasions. Because of the negative effects on his memory, he considered ECT to be the last alternative to avoid death. In part due to this medical history, his knowledge of pharmacology was usually greater than that of anyone who treated him. When he died, he was found alone in his apartment by two friends. The cause of death has never been publicly revealed. Footnotes Bibliography * Sources * R.

She was launched as HMS Vixen for the British Royal Navy before being transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. She was then named for the Sioux people of Canada's western provinces. Construction and career Vixen was ordered on 1 September 1941 as part of the 1941 shipbuilding programme. The destroyer's keel was laid down on 31 October 1942 by J. Samuel White at Cowes. The ship was launched on 14 September 1943.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 64 As part of the Warship Week in January 1942 Vixen was adopted by the town of Kirkcaldy, Fife. The destroyer was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, into which she was then commissioned and renamed on 21 February 1944 while fitting out at Cowes, and was completed on 5 March 1944. After commissioning Sioux joined the 26th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. The Home Fleet deployed on 29 March 1944 as part of the covering force for convoy JW 58 sailing to Russia. On 3 April, Sioux she escorted the aircraft carriers that attacked the , which was anchored at Altenfjord, Norway, and German shipping along the Norwegian coast as part of Operation Tungsten.Rohwer, p. 314 On 26 April, the destroyer was part of the screening force for strikes on German shipping off the coast of Norway and returned again in early May for more screening duties.Schull, p. 232 =Invasion of Normandy= On 15 May, the 26th Destroyer Flotilla began training exercises in anticipation for its participation in Operation Neptune. On 28 May Sioux sailed to Portsmouth as part of Canada's contribution to the Invasion of Normandy. During the assault on Juno Beach, Sioux bombarded shore batteries for forty minutes during the initial landing and provided fire support afterwards.Gimblett, p. 72 On 10‚Äì11 June, Sioux and the Polish destroyer were sent to intercept a German flotilla of schnellboots laying mines off Le Havre. The two destroyers failed to intercept the Germans.Rohwer, p. 332 On 23 June, the ship bombarded enemy troop concentrations near the mouth of the River Orne and a battery of field guns. The following day, Sioux and sister ship attacked a German battery near Franceville, which was to be their last mission off the coast of Normandy.Schull, p. 314 She remained with the invasion force until July when she returned to Scapa Flow. =Northern operations= After returning from operations in the Normandy area, Sioux rejoined the Home Fleet.Schull, p. 371 In August 1944, Algonquin and Sioux were among the escorts for a carrier force sent to attack German airfields at Gossen, Norway and to carry out attacks on Tirpitz.Rohwer, pp. 349‚Äì50 In September, Sioux escorted a force that performed attacks on German shipping off Norway. Upon returning from that, Sioux' sailed with a convoy sailing for Russia. On the return trip two merchant vessels were torpedoed.Schull, p. 375 On 14‚Äì15 October, Sioux escorted a force that was sent to perform air-mining and attacks on Axis shipping routes along the coast of Norway near Frohavet.Rohwer, p. 352 The destroyer returned to Norwegian waters from 26‚Äì28 October, escorting the aircraft carrier which attacked targets in Norway as part of Operation Athletic.Rohwer, p. 369 In early November the destroyer was laid up undergoing a boiler cleaning.Schull, p. 377 Sioux returned with Implacable for more attacks along the coast of Norway in late November.Rohwer, p. 371 After returning to Scapa Flow, Sioux escorted four convoys to the Soviet Union and back. From 7‚Äì14 December, the destroyer was among the escorts for a carrier force the sortied in support of the convoy RA 62.Rohwer, p. 376 On 30 December, the destroyer departed Loch Ewe as one of the escorts for convoy JW 63, arriving at Kola Inlet on 8 January 1945.Rohwer, p. 380 Sioux returned to Loch Ewe on 21 January escorting convoy RA 63.Rohwer, p. 386 During transit the convoy passed through a storm whose gales reached . The convoy fell apart and Sioux was sent to round up any straggling merchantmen. Sioux helped rescue crew from one disabled merchant and was then sent to search for three more disabled merchant vessels. The destroyer recovered the ships and brought all of them into the Faroes.Schull, p. 378 On 6 February, she left Loch Ewe with convoy JW 64. The convoy came under combined U-boat and air attack after being spotted by reconnaissance aircraft. The convoy arrived at its destination on 13 February, losing one corvette in exchange for 13 German aircraft.Rohwer, p. 392 After escorting convoy JW 64 to Polyarnoe, Sioux departed on 14 February as part of a relief expedition to convey 500 inhabitants of the Norwegian island of S√∏r√∏ya, left without food or fishing boats by the Germans, to safety. The expedition also involved , and . The inhabitants were dispersed among the ships of the next convoy, RA 64 for transit to the United Kingdom. Sioux joined the escort of the convoy on 17 February. RA 64 came under combined U-boat and air attack during its passage. Two freighters and one escort were sunk, another escort was severely damaged in exchange for six German aircraft shot down. Sioux left the escort on 27 February.Rohwer, pp. 393‚Äì94 On 12 March, Sioux joined the escort of convoy JW 65, which came under combined attack by U-boats and aircraft on 20 March. The convoy lost one freighter and one escort sunk and one merchant vessel severely damaged.Rohwer, p. 399 The destroyer returned to the United Kingdom with convoy RA 65 on 31 March.Rohwer, p. 403 =End of war= Sioux sailed to Halifax on 6 April, to prepare for transfer to the British Pacific Fleet and operations against Japan. The vessel underwent a major refit at Halifax and in November 1945 transferred to the west coast, being paid off on 27 February 1946 at Esquimalt. Sioux emerged, fully modernized, in 1950. As part of the modernization, she lost turrets 'X' and 'Y', which were replaced by two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She was also the first Canadian warship to be fitted with bunks instead of hammocks.Boutiller, p. 322 In March 1950, with the cruiser and destroyer , Sioux participated in a training cruise to Mexico, making several port visits. =Korean War first tour= After the declaration of war in Korea, Canada ordered three destroyers of the Pacific Division based at CFB Esquimalt to begin preparations for deployment to the Korean theatre. Sioux was in dry dock and not expected to leave it until 30 June 1950. However, after a massive effort by the dockside crews, Sioux departed with Cayuga and on 5 July 1950. The three vessels arrived at Sasebo on 30 July 1950.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 3‚Äì4 After arriving, the destroyer was assigned to Task Force 96.5 with Athabaskan escorting convoys of ships from Japan to Pusan. Initially retained at Sasebo for rescue missions, on 12 August 1950, the ship transferred to Task Unit 96.53.3 assigned to the west coast of Korea.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 12 After transiting, Sioux was ordered to bombard Popusompu (now a part of Beopseong-Myeon) on 20 August. At the end of the month the destroyer bombarded the island of Te bu Somu with and Cayuga.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 17 She helped provide naval support for the troops that landed at Inchon in September 1950 as part of Task Force 91.2, charged with escorting the logistic support group and enforcing the naval blockade. Along with several US and British cruisers and destroyers, Sioux, along with Cayuga and Athabaskan, bombarded the amphibious landing area at Wolmido Island just prior to the landing of troops. On 20 October 1950, Sioux joined Task Group 95.1 under the new command setup. She remained as part of the unit until her departure later in the year.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 20 The destroyer worked as part of the blockade force on the west coast until the end of the month before returning to Sasebo. She left Sasebo on 5 November 1950 for a visit to Hong Kong. However, en route the vessel encountered Typhoon Clara and suffered slight damage that required repairs upon her arrival.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 24‚Äì6 Upon the destroyer's return from Hong Kong she began blockade duties in coastal waters around Inchon and the mouth of the Yalu River, as part of Task Element 95.12 alongside the other Canadian vessels.Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 29 With the absence of the British cruisers, the destroyers of Task Element 95.12 were ordered on 3 December 1950 to cover the withdrawal of units from Chinnampo by escorting the transports into the harbour and providing gunfire support during their withdrawal. Reports claiming an emergency arrived from the harbour and the destroyers were forced to sail down the swept channel at night. While making her way up the channel, Sioux ran aground. Able to get herself clear, the destroyer then fouled her starboard screw, forcing her to retire. She and provided a covering force for the withdrawal the next day.Thorgrimsson and Russell, pp. 31‚Äì3 Sioux then spent the rest of her time in theatre screening the aircraft carrier, , escorting shipping, blockade patrol and providing general support for the forces evacuating Inchon. The destroyer returned to Sasebo on 2 January 1951 and spent two weeks preparing before returning home,Thorgrimsson and Russell, p. 36 departing 15 January 1951. She was replaced on station by . Sioux performed two more tours of duty in the Korean War and was the last Canadian ship to depart Korean waters. =Training and conversion= In 1953 Sioux was one of a number of Royal Canadian Navy ships which took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15 June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden She was primarily used for training purposes thereafter, until being paid off on 30 October 1963. The destroyer wore pennant 225 from 1949 until 1963.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 317 In November 1959, Sioux was converted to a frigate with two 4.7-inch guns, four torpedo tubes and two Squid launchers.Colledge, p. 670 She was towed to La Spezia, Italy and broken up there in 1965.

Until 14 March 1945 she was attached to 4th U-boat Flotilla for training. She was then assigned to 33rd U-boat Flotilla, a combat unit based at Flensburg. Her first, and only, active patrol started on 15 March 1945. She sank no vessels before the war ended and subsequently surrendered to a Canadian patrol. Surrender After the German surrender on 8 May 1945, the German High Command ordered all U-boats to surrender. On the afternoon of 10 May, U-889 was spotted south of Newfoundland by a RCAF airplane, steaming at 10 knots and flying a black flag of surrender. The RCAF plane radioed to nearby Western Escort Force W-6 who intercepted the submarine an hour later. U-889 was ordered to head to Bay Bulls, Newfoundland. 24 hours later U-889 was turned over to the frigates and who escorted her to Shelburne Harbour where she was boarded and Braeucker, her commanding officer, made a formal surrender. On 14 May 1945, U-889 was commissioned into the RCN and decommissioned in December 1945. U-889 was one of ten U-boats allocated to the United States as part of the Tripartite Naval Commission sitting in Berlin in November 1945. She sailed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 11 January 1946 and experiments were conducted on her special hydrophone gear. She was scuttled at the end of 1947.

Like its predecessor it contains many literary references: it blends together Homer's epics the Iliad and the Odyssey, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and has frequent smaller references to other works, including Proust, James Joyce, Caliban upon Setebos, Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, Shakespearean poetry and even William Blake and Virgil's Aeneid. Plot introduction The novel centers on three main character groups; that of the scholic Hockenberry, Helen and Greek and Trojan warriors from the Iliad; Daeman, Harman, Ada and the other humans of Earth; and the moravecs, specifically Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io. The novel is written in present-tense when centered on Hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons' Hyperion where the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novel and their stories do not begin to converge until the end.

The original wooden church and monastery were razed in the 1760s and construction for a new church was begun in 1768 and completed by 1800 when it was consecrated.Latkovskis, Leonhards Aglona: The History of the Church and Monastery, Publishing House of the Latgalian Culture Centre, Rƒìzekne 2009, It attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims every year on the day of the Assumption of Mary (15 August) as well as on Pentecost. The historic icon of the Aglona Mother of God is considered miraculous and has long been an object of veneration. Its dates to the 17th century and its authorship is unknown. In 1980 the Church celebrated its 200th anniversary and was officially given the status of a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II. In 1986 it was the site of celebration of the 800th anniversary of Christianity in Latvia. A major renovation of the basilica and expansion of the church grounds was begun in 1992 in preparation for the pope's visit. The shrine was visited by Pope John Paul II in September 1993 and over 300,000 pilgrims assembled at that time. Pope Francis visited in September 2018.

They continued to operate under their individual names until April 2015, when the stores were rebranded Lunds & Byerlys. In 2006, they launched its online grocery shopping service. Shoppers have the option of either picking up their groceries at certain stores or having it delivered to their home. Russell Lund Jr., the son of Russell Lund Sr and the heir to the Lunds grocery empire, murdered his estranged wife and her lover. After turning himself in for the crime, he committed suicide. Lunds was founded as Hove's in the early twentieth century at the corner of Lake Street and Hennepin Avenue in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis. Russell Lund, Sr., an employee, took an equity stake in the cheese and cracker department in 1922 and after founding a popcorn business, a larger stake in 1939. The chain took the Lunds name in 1964.

Byerly's opened fourteen other stores in the metro area. Byerly's stores, which range in size from 50,000 to , were previously open 24 hours a day. Store hours changed in February 2008 and are now open 6am to 12am. Byerly's locations also offer in-store United States Post Offices, full-service banks, pharmacies, coffee shops, floral departments, wines & spirits shops, and formerly in-store Byerly's restaurants. All Byerly's branded restaurants have now closed, but a restaurant named \\"Minnesota Grill\\" still operates out of the Roseville store location offering limited Lund's and Byerly's food items. The store is known for its \\"great customer service\\" and its deli and bakery. Byerly's is commonly viewed as high-end grocery shopping, and prices are therefore relatively similar to other retail stores selling the same brands.

Phase-locked loop frequency synthesizers make use of frequency dividers to generate a frequency that is a multiple of a reference frequency. Frequency dividers can be implemented for both analog and digital applications.  Analog dividers  Analog frequency dividers are less common and used only at very high frequencies. Digital dividers implemented in modern IC technologies can work up to tens of GHz. =Regenerative frequency divider= A regenerative frequency divider, also known as a Miller frequency divider, mixes the input signal with the feedback signal from the mixer. Regenerative frequency divider The feedback signal is f_{in}/2. This produces sum and difference frequencies f_{in}/2, 3f_{in}/2 at the output of the mixer. A low pass filter removes the higher frequency and the f_{in}/2 frequency is amplified and fed back into mixer. =Injection-locked frequency divider= A free-running oscillator which has a small amount of a higher-frequency signal fed to it will tend to oscillate in step with the input signal. Such frequency dividers were essential in the development of television. It operates similarly to an injection locked oscillator. In an injection locked frequency divider, the frequency of the input signal is a multiple (or fraction) of the free-running frequency of the oscillator. While these frequency dividers tend to be lower power than broadband static (or flip-flop based) frequency dividers, the drawback is their low locking range. The ILFD locking range is inversely proportional to the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator tank. In integrated circuit designs, this makes an ILFD sensitive to process variations. Care must be taken to ensure the tuning range of the driving circuit (for example, a voltage-controlled oscillator) must fall within the input locking range of the ILFD.  Digital dividers  An animation of a frequency divider implemented with D flip-flops, counting from 0 to 7 in binary For power-of-2 integer division, a simple binary counter can be used, clocked by the input signal. The least-significant output bit alternates at 1/2 the rate of the input clock, the next bit at 1/4 the rate, the third bit at 1/8 the rate, etc. An arrangement of flipflops is a classic method for integer-n division. Such division is frequency and phase coherent to the source over environmental variations including temperature. The easiest configuration is a series where each flip-flop is a divide-by-2. For a series of three of these, such system would be a divide-by-8. By adding additional logic gates to the chain of flip flops, other division ratios can be obtained. Integrated circuit logic families can provide a single chip solution for some common division ratios. Another popular circuit to divide a digital signal by an even integer multiple is a Johnson counter. This is a type of shift register network that is clocked by the input signal. The last register's complemented output is fed back to the first register's input. The output signal is derived from one or more of the register outputs. For example, a divide-by-6 divider can be constructed with a 3-register Johnson counter. The six valid values of the counter are 000, 100, 110, 111, 011, and 001. This pattern repeats each time the network is clocked by the input signal. The output of each register is a f/6 square wave with 60¬∞ of phase shift between registers. Additional registers can be added to provide additional integer divisors. =Mixed signal division= (Classification: asynchronous sequential logic) An arrangement of D flip-flops is a classic method for integer-n division. Such division is frequency and phase coherent to the source over environmental variations including temperature. The easiest configuration is a series where each D flip-flop is a divide-by-2. For a series of three of these, such system would be a divide-by-8. More complicated configurations have been found that generate odd factors such as a divide-by-5. Standard, classic logic chips that implement this or similar frequency division functions include the 7456, 7457, 74292, and 74294. (see list of 7400 series and list of 4000 series logic chips)  Fractional-n dividers  A fractional-n frequency synthesizer can be constructed using two integer dividers, a divide-by-n and a divide-by-(n + 1) frequency divider. With a modulus controller, n is toggled between the two values so that the VCO alternates between one locked frequency and the other. The VCO stabilizes at a frequency that is the time average of the two locked frequencies. By varying the percentage of time the frequency divider spends at the two divider values, the frequency of the locked VCO can be selected with very fine granularity. = Delta-sigma fractional-n synthesizers = If the sequence of divide by n and divide by (n + 1) is periodic, spurious signals appear at the VCO output in addition to the desired frequency. Delta-sigma fractional-n dividers overcome this problem by randomizing the selection of n and (n + 1), while maintaining the time-averaged ratios.

Transamund rose to power by deposing his own father, Faroald II, and tonsuring him in a monastery. In 737 or 738, Transamund captured Gallese and thus disrupted communication between Rome and Ravenna. Pope Gregory III offered to pay for the return of Gallese in return for a peace treaty with Transamund. The treaty included the Gregory, Duke of Benevento. Liutprand rejected the treaty as contrary his interests and attacked Transamund as a traitor. He had taken Spoleto by 16 June 739 and appointed Hilderic as his replacement.Hartmann, Ludo Moritz. Geschichte Italiens im Mittelalter. II, 2, 137-138. Transamund fled to Rome, where Liutprand besieged him. The king took Amelia, Orte, Bomarzo, and Bieda, but still the pope refused to release his refugee. Gregory even wrote to ask Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, for assistance. Charles, however, refused.Hodgkin, Thomas. Italy and her Invaders. Clarendon Press, 1895. pp 475‚Äî478. In December 740, Transamund recovered his duchy and killed Hilderic with Papal-Beneventan aid,Hartmann, II, 2, 139. but did not return the confiscated papal cities and his alliance with the pope ruptured. Liutprand did not recognise Transamund's reconquest and set out to dispossess him a second time. This time Liutprand met with Gregory's successor, Zachary, in 742 and, promising to restore the four towns, allied with the Romans and forced Transamund to flee again.Hartmann, II, 2, pp. 139, 140. Transamund was caught and put in a monastery. Agiprand, Liutprand's nephew, was put in his place. The new duke of Benevento, Godescalc, who had succeeded Gregory without royal assent and continued to support Transamund, was the next object of royal wrath. On Liutprand's death in 744, Transamund managed to regain power in Spoleto. He lasted another year under the weak King Hildeprand the Useless until he died. References Notes Sources *Paul the Deacon.

College students playing the game (United States, 2006) Buck buck (also known as Johnny-on-a- Pony, or Johnny-on-the-Pony) is a children's game with several variants. One version of the game is played when \\"one player climbs another's back\\" and the climber guesses \\"the number of certain objects out of sight\\". Another version of the game is played with \\"one group of players [climbing] on the backs of a second group in order to build as large a pile as possible or to cause the supporting players to collapse.\\" As early as the 16th century, children in Europe and the Near East played Buck, Buck, which had been called \\"Bucca Bucca quot sunt hic? Pieter Bruegel's painting Children's Games (1560) depicts children playing a variant of the game. In the United Kingdom, the game is sometimes called High Cockalorum, but has a large number of different names in various local dialects. These include: \\"Polly on the Mopstick\\" in Birmingham, \\"Strong Horses, Weak Donkeys\\" in Monmouthshire, \\"Hunch, Cuddy, Hunch\\" in west Scotland, \\"Mont-a-Kitty\\" in Middlesbrough, \\"Husky Fusky Finger or Thumb\\" in Nottinghamshire, \\"High Jimmy Knacker\\" in east London, \\"Jump the Knacker 1-2-3\\" in Watford, \\"Wall-e-Acker\\" or \\"Warny Echo\\" in north West London, \\"Stagger Loney\\" in Cardiff, \\"Pomperino\\" in St Ives, Cornwall and \\"Trust\\" in Lancashire. The game is sometimes played in the sergeants' or officers' messes of the British Armed Forces. Other national variants A similar game is played in South Korea (malttukbakgi). is a game that both Korean girls and boys play up until high school. In malttukbakgi, there are two teams. Team A has one person stand up against the wall and the rest of the team have all their heads up in someone else‚Äôs butt/crotch area to form what looks like a big horse. Team B then jumps up onto the human horse one by one, each jumping with as much force as possible. If anyone from any team falls to the floor, that team loses. If everyone stays up, then the person against the wall and the person in front will play a game of gawibawibo (rock, scissor, paper) to determine the winner. In Turkey, a similar game is Uzun E≈üek (\\"Long Donkey\\"). The person standing up is the referee and is called the \\"pillow\\". One team bends over, then the other team one by one jumps on the \\"donkey\\". If the Donkey can stand the pressure, the first person to go in the jumping team puts up one or two with his fingers. If the donkey can guess the number right, they are permitted to jump. If the jumpers fall to the ground, it is the donkey's turn to jump. If the donkey falls, the jumpers jump again. In popular culture Bill Cosby's 1967 album Revenge includes a track \\"Buck, Buck\\" in which he describes playing the game as a child. He mentions that in his hometown of Philadelphia it was called \\"Buck Buck\\", while in New York City it was known as \\"Johnny on the Pony\\". This track introduces Fat Albert, \\"the baddest Buck Buck breaker in the world,\\" who \\"weighed 2,000 pounds\\" and could cause earthquakes when he ran down the street. The character would later become the basis for the cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids which includes a buck buck episode (season 1 episode 6). The same story, in a slightly different form, is also included in Cosby's book Childhood.

The word gravina comes from the Latin grava or from the messapic graba, with the meaning of rock, shaft and erosion of bank river.Rohlfs, 1976 Other words that share the same root are grava, gravaglione and gravinelle.Parise, 2003 Alternatively, when the emperor Frederick II went to Gravina, because of the large extension of the lands and for the presence of wheat, he decided to give to it the motto Grana dat et vina., that is to say It offers wheat and wine..Periodic of cultural information, Gravina's Castle, Cocco Cornacchia, January 1990 Gravina is the home of the Alta Murgia National Park. History Thanks to its strategic position, Gravina has a very ancient history. Its territory has been inhabited since the Paleolithic, due to the high presence of water and woods. The largest remains date back to the Neolithic. The oldest settlements have been identified in the districts of Botromagno, S.Paolo, Vagnari, S.Stefano and S.Staso (early Christian). The town has been known with the names Sidis (Œ£ŒØŒ¥ŒπœÇ), Sylbion (Œ£ŒπŒªŒ≤√¨ŒøŒΩ), Sidio, Silvium, Petramagna or Botromagno (name of the hill where the ancient inhabited area has developed). An important find of a skeleton belonging to an Asiatic man in the Vagnari necropolis testifies the existence of relations between the town of Gravina and the Far East already in 200 BCE. The town was then colonized by the Greeks during the colonization of Greater Greece, as a polis with the right of a mint of his own. Diodorus notes it as an Apulian town, which was wrested from the Samnites by the Romans during the 3rd Samnite War (305 or 306 BCE).Diod. xx. 80 It was a town in the interior of Apulia. It is noticed by Strabovi. p. 283 as the frontier town of the Peucetii, and its name is noticed by Pliny among the municipal towns of Apulia.Plin. iii. 11. s. 16 The Via Appia, which linked Rome to Brindisi, passed through Gravina. The Itineraries place it from Venusia, on the branch of the Appian Way which led direct to Tarentum. The ruins of Frederick II's castle in Gravina in Puglia. Later it was ruled by Byzantines, Lombards and North African Muslims. The town was the site of a Norman countship in the Hauteville Kingdom of Sicily and in the later Kingdom of Naples. A famous count of the former was Gilbert, who was sent by his cousin, the Queen regent Margaret of Navarre to the peninsula to combat the Holy Roman Emperor. In the latter period it was the hereditary fief of John, Duke of Durazzo. The Normans called the town Garagnone or Garaynone. From 1386 to 1816 it was a fief of the Orsini family: the pope Benedict XIII (Pietro Francesco Orsini-Gravina) was born here in 1649. Feudal oppression led to numerous riots, in particular from 1789 until the unification of Italy (1861). Gravina in Puglia was partly destroyed by Allied bombings during World War II.

Following the earthquake of 1722, the bridge was restored and transformed into an aqueduct by the Orsini family of Rome, who then moved to Gravina around the middle of the 18th century. Culture Gravina in Puglia is famous for one of the oldest fairs in Europe: the Saint George's Fair has been held each April since 1294. Gravina's cuisine, one of Apulia's most traditional ones, is based on three typical agricultural products found within the surrounding region of Apulia, namely wheat, olive oil and wine. The local cuisine is also enriched by the wide variety of fruit and vegetables produced locally. The town is also known for a particular cheese, named \\"Pallone di Gravina\\". =Gravina DOC= The commune of Gravina in Puglia produces a white Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) Italian wine that can be made in a still or sparkling Spumante style. While the still Gravina wine is almost always dry, the sparkling Gravina wine can be made in both a dry secco and slightly sweet amabile style. All grapes destined for DOC wine production need to be harvested to a yield no greater than 15 tonnes/ha. The wine is made primarily (40-65%) from Malvasia del Chianti, Greco di Tufo and Bianco d'Alessano with the last two grape varieties collectively permitted to make up between 35-60% of the blend. Bombino bianco, Trebbiano Toscano and Verdeca are also permitted up to a maximum of 10%.

Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful. Traditionally, religious language has been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non- literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions. Empiricist David Hume's requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically ‚Äì with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless. The analogy of games ‚Äì most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein ‚Äì has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of \\"bliks\\" ‚Äì unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established ‚Äì which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death. Problem of religious language Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him. The medieval doctrine of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties ‚Äì these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity. The theologian Sallie McFague believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless. Classical understanding of religious language =Via negativa= 18th-century depiction of Maimonides, who developed the via negativa Jewish philosopher Maimonides believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God. Maimonides believed that God is simple and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes. He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, \\"God lives\\" should be taken as \\"God does not lack vitality\\". Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God. =Analogy= Thomas Aquinas argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness. Philosopher Taede Smedes argued that religious language is symbolic. Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors. In the twentieth century, Ian Ramsey developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied. =Symbolism= Sikh religious text, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan, in which religious language is used symbolically Philosopher Paul Tillich argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times. Louis Dupr√© differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign. Dupr√© believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself. A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived. Dupr√© differentiates between religious and aesthetic symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which \\"remains forever beyond our reach\\". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it. Langdon Brown Gilkey explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived. In the Sikh religious text the Guru Granth Sahib, religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the experiences they have while meditating are ineffable, incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous ‚Äì this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised. To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality. =Myth= William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as \\"folktales\\". Using the example of creation myths, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory. Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann proposed that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self- understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God. Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick believed that demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God. Alternative explanations of religious language =Political= Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications. =Performative= Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making truth-claims; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals. He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses performative, as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words \\"I promise\\" perform the action of promising themselves ‚Äì Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function. Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that \\"the meaning of the language is in the use\\", taking the use of language to be performative. The philosopher J. L. Austin argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children. He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about. Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent. =Imperative= British philosopher R. B. Braithwaite attempted to approach religious language empirically and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of \\"meaning as use\\". He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and parables. Professor Nathan Katz writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim. Challenges to religious language =David Hume= In the conclusion of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it. Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century. =Logical positivism= The logical positivism movement originated in the Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless. In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God ‚Äì theistic, atheistic and agnostic ‚Äì arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus with the proposition that \\"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\\" Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the mystical, which cannot be described, as important. Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary. =Falsification= The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement \\"God loves us\\" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless. Using John Wisdom's parable of the invisible gardener, Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected. Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a \\"death by a thousand qualifications\\" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful. Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless. Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless. Drawing specifically on the emerging science of molecular genetics (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion \\"that there is no creator God\\" might be falsified; \\"the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done.\\" Analogies of games The analogy of a game was first proposed by Hans-Georg Gadamer in an attempt to demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ. Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative language-game analogy. He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language. Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context. Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: \\"Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying\\". Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional ‚Äì a confession of what someone feels and believes ‚Äì rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game. Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical. Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games. Parables =R. M. Hare= In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher R. M. Hare told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a \\"blik\\", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people ‚Äì religious and non-religious ‚Äì hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by empirical evidence. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world. Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two. =Basil Mitchell= Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief. =John Hick= Responding to the verification principle, John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of eschatological verificationism. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death. Hick believed that eschatological verification is \\"unsymmetrical\\" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary \\"symmetrical\\" statements, which can be verified or falsified. In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless. James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.

The said pair of pools were built by the Sinhalese in the ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura. These are considered one of the significant achievements in the field of hydrological engineering and outstanding architectural and artistic creations of the ancient Sinhalese. Dimensions A garden was landscaped which separates the two ponds which long is 18¬Ω ft. The larger pool of the two is 132 ft by 51 ft, while the smaller pool is 91 ft by 51 ft. The depths of the two pools is 14 ft and 18 ft for the smaller pool and the larger pool respectively. Construction The faces of the pools were cut granite slabs which includes the bottom and the sides of the pool. A wall was also built around the pool which encloses the compound. Flights of steps are seen on both ends of the pool decorated with punkalas, or pots of abundance and scroll design. Embankments were constructed to enable monks to bathe using pots or other utensils. Water to the pools were transferred through underground ducts and filtered before flowing to the pool and in a similar fashion the water was emptied. Dr. Senarath Paranavithana was actively involved in the restoration of the ponds, in which small figures of fish, a conch, a crab and a dancing woman were found in the bottom.

He later became a manager, notably managing TSV 1860 Munich for nine years between 1992 and 2001. Playing career Born in Welver, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lorant commenced his professional career 1970 in the second division with Westfalia Herne. 1971 he moved to Borussia Dortmund. There he was part of a side that lost 1‚Äì11 against Bayern Munich and was relegated in 1972. He stuck with the club in its first second division club, but the joined in 1973 Rot-Weiss Essen, a side that just won promotion to the Bundesliga. He stayed with the struggling club around their star Willi Lippens and players like Manfred Burgsm√ºller and Horst Hrubesch until relegation in 1977. Then he joined 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken for a season, experiencing his third relegation. The next four- and-a-half years he spent with Eintracht Frankfurt. With this club he won the UEFA Cup 1980, prevailing in the finals against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. In 1981, he helped win the German Cup with a 3‚Äì1 victory in the final against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. With Eintracht Lorant played amongst others alongside the World Cup winners of 1974 J√ºrgen Grabowski and Bernd H√∂lzenbein. Other notable players were Norbert Nachtweih, Bernd Nickel and the Austrian international Bruno Pezzey. He left Eintracht mid-season 1982‚Äì83 for just promoted FC Schalke 04. By the end of the season he had to face the fourth relegation of his career. He then quickly moved on to second division side Hannover 96, where he ended his time as a professional player after one season. Coaching career After a brief stint as part-time coach of an amateur side in 1982 he commenced a full-time coaching career as player manager of SV Heidingsfeld in the Bavarian town of W√ºrzburg from 1984 to 86 and 1986 to 90 with 1. FC Schweinfurt 05, with which he achieved the then amateur third division championship and promotion. From 1990 to 1992 he coached Viktoria Aschaffenburg, also in the third division, where he won the championship in 1992. After this he was hired by TSV 1860 Munich, a team that then had been dwelling for some years in the third division. He took the club inside two years to the first division and in 1997 qualified for the UEFA Cup, where 1860 was ousted in the first round by Austrian side Rapid Wien. In 2000, he led 1860 into the qualification for the Champions League, where the team lost against Leeds United with 1‚Äì2 and 0‚Äì1. In the ensuing UEFA Cup campaign 1860 was stopped by Italian club AC Parma: after a respectable 2‚Äì2 draw away, 1860 lost the home leg 0‚Äì2. In the season a sweltering conflict with club president Wildmoser came to a head after the team lost in the derby against Bayern Munich 1‚Äì5 and Lorant was let go. Notable players during his tenure with 1860 were the German internationals Thomas H√§√üler and Martin Max who played there from 1999 in the autumn of their careers. Max became twice top scorer of the Bundesliga in this phase. German international Jens Jeremies was discovered at the club during Lorant's tenure. Foreign internationals were amongst others Ab√©di Pel√© from Ghana, Harald Cerny from Austria, Miroslav Stevic from Serbia as well as the Australians Paul Agostino and Ned Zelic. Horst Heldt, Olaf Bodden, Manfred Schwabl and Bernd Trares were further players of note in this era. In the ensuing years Lorant coached SpVgg Unterhaching and LR Ahlen in Germany, Fenerbah√ße, Sivasspor, Kayseri Erciyesspor and Kasƒ±mpa≈üa S.K. in Turkey, APOEL in Cyprus, Saipa Teheran in Iran, Incheon United in South Korea, Liaoning Hongyun in China and DAC Dunajsk√° Streda in Slovakia. Most of these engagements ended up being very short term and the sides were often struggling to retain the class. With Apoel in Cyprus, where Lorant spent two months in 2005, he became runner-up in the championship, however, the club hoped that he would take them to the title. In March 2010, he was appointed sports manager of fourth division side Tennis Borussia Berlin, however, the club folded in May. In April 2015, Lorant was appointed as manager of TSV Waging until the end of the season. In January 2017, he took charge of √ñTSU Hallein. In April 2019, he took charge of FC Hallein 04 until the end of the season.

The Heights received funding from the school and ran stories about student clubs, sporting events, and lectures on campus. The first board declared The Heights a ‚Äúnews organ‚Äù that would live up to the ‚Äúpurity and ruggedness‚Äù of its name.https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&d;=bcheights19191119.2.5&e;=-------en-20-- 1--txt-txIN------- Notably, in 1920, an editorial ran suggesting that the mascot of BC be an eagle; the Eagle remains the mascot of Boston College.https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&d;=bcheights19201015-02.2.8&srpos;=2&e;=------192-en-20-bcheights-1 --txt-txIN-mascot+eagle----1920-- Through the early years of the ‚Äô30s and ‚Äô40s, The Heights remained focused on campus issues. During World War II, The Heights began to include editorials of greater international focus, including pieces about the draft and the war, though Boston College remained the focal point. Among other issues, The Heights wrote heavily about the need for an active student council; The Heights first petitioned in 1947, predating the current undergraduate government (UGBC) by a number of years.https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&d;=bcheights19470328.2.10&srpos;=4&e;=------194-en-20-bcheights-1 --txt-txIN-%22student+council%22----1947-- Before the ‚Äô50s, the buildings in the Quad had no official names. What is now Gasson was simply ‚Äúthe tower building,‚Äù https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&d;=bcheights19481112.2.31&srpos;=1&e;=------194-en-20-bcheights-1 --txt-txIN-naming+buildings------ and what are now Lyons, Devlin, and Fulton were also nameless. The Heights suggested naming the buildings after influential figures in the university's history.https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&d;=bcheights19520111.2.26&srpos;=1&e;=------195-en-20-bcheights-1 --txt-txIN-naming+buildings------ Eventually, the focus of The Heights was not limited to University issues, but also included national issues. In the 1950s, The Heights reprinted a Martin Luther King Jr. article, and in 1960, accusing the University of not honoring the rights of its black students. The Heights also became more vocal about the Vietnam War, encouraging discussion of the war and calling for an end to it through support of protest groups. These more liberal attitudes at the time were a shift from Boston College's more conservative, Catholic values, and became the beginnings of a strained relationship between the paper and the University administrators. =Loss of School Funding= By the mid-‚Äô60s, the paper began to come into conflict with the school's administration. At one point, the paper wanted to sponsor a lecture by birth control activist William Baird, but the University wouldn‚Äôt allow it, as birth control opposes stated Jesuit and Catholic values; The Heights still held the lecture in its office in McElroy. The University placed sanctions on five Heights editors for their actions. Thus began University president Fr. Joyce's somewhat tense relationship with The Heights. Soon, though, the paper would be forced to divorce itself from university funding in order to maintain editorial independence. In 1971, The Heights had a source bug a Board of Trustees meeting and printed a transcript of the meeting in the next issue, publicizing the University‚Äôs plans to fire Executive Vice President Fr. F.X. Shea. The administration pressed charges and had a restraining order put on the information. The paper's editors, Tom Sheehan and Michael Berkey, were arrested on charges of conspiring to obtain information by illegal means. They pleaded no contest and were assessed a small fine. Sheehan and Berkey believed they were acting in the best interest of the student body; one BC professor, Richard Hughes, described Sheehan as ‚Äúa genuine crusader, passionately dedicated to his beliefs.‚Äùhttp://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2006/11/16/Features/A.Reason.To.Rally-2462870.shtml The administration evicted The Heights, and cut off all funding after the incident. In the meantime, the newspaper operated out of the office of the Undergraduate Government of Boston College (UGBC) with borrowed money. Eventually, editors cut a deal with the administration to rent out McElroy 113, its current location. From 1971 onwards, The Heights would be an independent college newspaper, but would occasionally still clash with the values of the Jesuit University; in 1978, the University threatened not to renew lease after the paper published ads for an abortion clinic. =Modern- day Paper= In recent years, the board has editorialized in favor of the creation of a Gay-Straight alliancehttp://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2003/04/22/Editorial/The- Right.Direction-420266.shtml and the revisions of the non-discrimination policy. As an independent student newspaper, The Heights may print what the editorial board chooses, but in order to retain good relationships with the University for a variety of reasons (though the university could not stop the paper from printing per se, they control campus distribution rights and the terms of The Heights' lease agreement for its office on campus), the board has agreed not to run sexually explicit ads or ads \\"for service(s) which may reasonably be interpreted as abortion.\\" https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&d;=bcheights19850121.2.22&srpos;=2&e;=-------en-20-bcheights-1 --txt-txIN-%22lease+agreement%22+-ARTICLE----- In 2003, The Heights‚Äô lease was called into question, following publication of a sexually explicit column called ‚ÄúSex and the Univer- city‚Äù.http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2003/02/04/Features/Sex- And.The.University-358806.shtml A resolution has since been reached, and relationship with the university has been restored.

He was one of six environmental activists arrested December 7, 2005 as part of the FBI's Operation Backfire. His charge was one count of arson for a June, 1998 fire set by the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) at the National Wildlife Research Center in Olympia, Washington. He was found dead in his jail cell on December 21, 2005. According to police, Rodgers committed suicide using a plastic bag. Biography = Before ELF = Rodgers first adopted deep ecology style thinking and engaged in Earth First! activism at Mt. Graham telescope project protests of the early 1990s in Arizona. He lived out of his Toyota 4√ó4 as he traveled North America's wild lands and became involved in many Earth First demonstrations of that time. Rogers was one of the few long-term activists to camp out in snow caves in central Idaho's deepest wilderness during the Cove/Mallard timber sale in the winter of 1994‚Äì1995. His experiences and exposure in some of the last true wild lands of this planet must have further radicalized Avalon beyond the civil disobedience activism of Earth First! (EF). EF style civil disobedience was at the time was under consideration as possible terrorism by the US Congress in hearings of select subcommittees. Avalon was a long-term EF activist, one of the occupation activists of the Cove / Mallard timber sale protests for years, and was one of four protesters whom constantly camped out in snow-caves in the winter of January‚ÄìMarch 1995 in 12 foot deep snow and sub-zero temps, monitoring the logging traffic on Noble Road. After witnessing the destruction of \\"America's Amazon Jungle\\", Avalon became disenchanted with mere civil-disobedience tactics and grew more radical.William C. Rodgers Avalon briefly secluded himself in Spring 1995 only to reappear at the Earth First 11 month-long occupation of the Warner Creek timber sale or 'Free Cascadia' in Oregon. During these times Avalon always spoke of being a witness for the defenseless and was a peaceful presence. While participating in the occupation of Warner Creek Oregon, Rogers first met Jacob Ferguson aka \\"Donut\\", the man who years later turned FBI informant against this cell of Earth Liberation Front activists, to avoid prison time for heroin possession.Associated Press 05/24/2007 by Jeff Barnard Ironically, Rodgers openly debated with other radical environmentalists against the effectiveness of targeted property destruction operations, during the mid-1990s. =ELF and later= The Catalyst Infoshop Between 1996 and 2001 the ELF cell Rogers was involved in is alleged to have started fifteen fires across the West. Rodgers wrote an article for the Earth First Journal about how drug abuse was sapping the will & strength of the environmental movement as activists got depressed and sought solace from the emotional pain by smoking marijuana or drinking heavily. After an action involving burning SUVs in March 2001, the Police become suspicious of ELF cell member Ferguson. Rogers, worried of getting caught and tired of infighting, moved to Prescott, Arizona. In 2004, Rogers co-founded the Catalyst Infoshop with Katie Rose Nelson. = Arrest and Death = Rodgers was arrested in an FBI raid on December 7, 2005 at the Catalyst Infoshop. The FBI were working on information provided by Ferguson, an informer from the same ELF cell as Rodgers. Rodgers wrote a suicide note which he mailed to a number of his friends:  Government claims  The FBI has claimed that Rodgers was a criminal \\"mastermind\\" and the anonymous author of Setting Fire with Electrical Timers, an Earth Liberation Front Guide,Prosecutors portray close-knit arson team, The Seattle Times, 21 January 2006. which explained in detail how to create an incendiary device known as a \\"cat's cradle\\". Authorities said that once the guide was published they no longer were able to tell with certainty when the ELF cell connected to Rodgers was responsible for an arson.  Continuing influence  Rodgers has had a continuing impact on various anarchist and radical environmentalist movements. A number of acts have been dedicated to his memory. Among these have been the removal of 28 beagle puppies from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Independent University of Madrid28 beagles rescued by ALF, Bombs and Shields, 12 January 2006. and the burning of a partially constructed development in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.Anti-Sprawl ELF Action in Memory of William Rodgers , Mostly Water, 10 February 2006.

It is commonly used in areal linguistics in contrast with Sinosphere. Influence The Tibeto-Burman family of languages, which extends over a huge geographic range, is characterized by great typological diversity, comprising languages that range from the highly tonal, monosyllabic, analytic type with practically no affixational morphology, like the Loloish languages, to marginally tonal or atonal languages with complex systems of verbal agreement morphology, like the Kiranti group of Nepal. This diversity is partly to be explained in terms of areal influences from Chinese on the one hand and Indo-Aryan languages on the other. Matisoff proposed two large and overlapping areas combining cultural and linguistic features ‚Äì the \\"Sinosphere\\" and the \\"Indosphere\\", influenced by China and India respectively.Robert M. W. Dixon, Y. Alexandra, Adjective Classes: A Cross-linguistic Typology , page 74, Oxford University Press, 2004, RJ LaPolla, The Sino-Tibetan Languages, La Trobe University A buffer zone between them as a third group was proposed by Kristine A. Hildebrandt, followed by B. Bickel and J. Nichols. The Indosphere is dominated by Indic languages. Some languages and cultures firmly belong to one or the other. For example, the Munda and Khasi branches of Austroasiatic languages, the Tibeto- Burman languages of Eastern Nepal, and much of the \\"Kamarupan\\" group of Tibeto-Burman, which most notably includes the Meitei (Manipuri), are Indospheric; while the Hmong‚ÄìMien family, the Kam‚ÄìSui branch of Kadai, the Loloish branch of Tibeto-Burman, and Vietnamese (Viet‚ÄìMuong) are Sinospheric. Some other languages, like Thai and Tibetan, have been influenced by both Chinese and Indian culture at different historical periods. Still other linguistic communities are so remote geographically that they have escaped significant influence from either. For example, the Aslian branch of Mon‚ÄìKhmer in Malaya, or the Nicobarese branch of Mon‚ÄìKhmer in the Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean show little influence by Sinosphere or Indosphere. The Bodish languages and Kham languages are characterized by hybrid prosodic properties akin to related Indospheric languages towards the west and also Sinospheric languages towards the east.Matti Miestamo & Bernhard W√§lchli, New Challenges in Typology, page 90, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, Some languages of the Kiranti group in the Indosphere rank among the morphologically most complex languages of Asia.David Levinson & Karen Christensen, Encyclopedia of Modern Asia: a berkshire reference work, page 494, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002, Indian cultural, intellectual, and political influence ‚Äì especially that of Pallava writing system ‚Äì began to penetrate both insular and peninsular Southeast Asia about 2000 years ago. Indic writing systems were adopted first by Austronesians, like Javanese and Cham, and Austroasiatics, like Khmer and Mon, then by Tai (Siamese and Lao) and Tibeto-Burmans (Pyu, Burmese, and Karen). Indospheric languages are also found in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), defined as the region encompassing Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, as well as parts of Burma, Peninsular Malaysia and Vietnam. Related scripts are also found in South East Asian islands ranging from Sumatra, Java, Bali, south Sulawesi and most of the Philippines.Martin Haspelmath, The World Atlas of Language Structures, page 569, Oxford University Press, 2005, The learned components of the vocabularies of Khmer, Mon, Burmese and Thai/Lao consist of words of Pali or Sanskrit origin. Indian influence also spread north to the Himalayan region. Tibetan has used Ranjana writing since 600 AD, but has preferred to calque new religious and technical vocabulary from native morphemes rather than borrowing Indian ones. The Cham empires, known collectively as Champa, which were founded around the end of 2nd century AD, belonged directly to Indosphere of influence, rather than to the Sinosphere which shaped so much of Vietnamese culture and by which Chams were influenced later and indirectly.Umberto Ansaldo, Stephen Matthews & Lisa Lim, Deconstructing Creole, page 113, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2007, Structure Languages in the \\"Sinosphere\\" (East Asia and Viet Nam) tend to be analytic, with little morphology, monosyllabic or sesquisyllabic lexical structures, extensive compounding, complex tonal systems, and serial verb constructions. Languages in the \\"Indosphere\\" (South Asia and Southeast Asia) tend to be more agglutinative, with polysyllabic structures, extensive case and verb morphology, and detailed markings of interpropositional relationships. Manange (like other Tamangic languages) is an interesting case to examine in this regard, as geographically it fits squarely in the \\"Indospheric\\" Himalayas, but typologically it shares more features with the \\"Sinospheric\\" languages. Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the Sinosphere tend to be more isolating, while those spoken in the Indosphere tend to be more morphologically complex.Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald & Robert M. W. Dixon, Grammars in Contact, page 4, Oxford University Press, 2006, Many languages in the western side of the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes the Tibeto-Burman languages, show significant typological resemblances with other languages of the South Asia, which puts them in the group of Indosphere. They often have heavier syllables than found in the east, while tone systems, though attested, are not as frequent.Carol Genetti, A Grammar of Dolakha Newar, page 3, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, Indospheric languages are often toneless and/or highly suffixal.Colin Renfrew, April M. S. McMahon & Robert Lawrence Trask, Time Depth in Historical Linguistics, page 334, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, 2000, Often there is considerable inflectional morphology, from fully developed case marking systems to extensive pronominal morphology found on the verb. These languages generally mark a number of types of inter-casual relationships and have distinct construction involving verbal auxiliaries. Languages of the Indosphere typically display retroflex stop consonants, postsentential relative clauses and the extended grammaticalization of the verb say. In Indospheric languages, such as the Tibeto-Burman languages of Northeast India and Nepal, for example, the development of relative pronouns and correlative structures as well as of retroflex initial consonants is often found.

The track was first announced in July 2006, before the music video debuted on TRL on 1 August. \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" was released to radio on July 25, 2006. The song was later released to Modern Rock Radio in September, shortly before the album was released. The single marked a musical departure for the band and was seen by critics as a step away from their usual pop punk sound, with the addition of prominent piano instrumentation. According to internet radio website Last.fm, \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" is the most played song from Coming Home, with 145,000 current listeners. Composition \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" is a rock song at a length of three minutes and thirty seven seconds, written by the five members of New Found Glory, all of whom share credits for the music composition and the lyrics. The song is composed in the A Major key and has a \\"moderate tempo\\" of 129 beats per minute. The band's primary composer and guitarist Chad Gilbert, notes that the song has \\"big, full guitars and a piano line that goes throughout. It's pretty anthemic, and Jordan's voice has never sounded better.\\" Gilbert further explained that, \\"This one shows how we've changed. We're a band who have done different styles of songs every record. There's some really metal riffs on Catalyst that aren't on Coming Home, and then this had some pianos. We're music fans, so we want every record to sound different\\". Lyrically, the song is about dealing with time apart in a relationship. The band's lead vocalist Jordan Pundik has noted, \\"I want people to think it's about whatever they want, but for me, it's about when you're in love with someone and you're away from them and you have an argument or a fight and it's over the phone, so you can't console them.\\" Critical reception As with Coming Home, \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" was warmly received by music critics. In a review for The Palm Beach Post it was noted that, \\"Coming Home is similar, in spirit, to the 1990s crooning of Chicago's brilliant Smoking Popes. Jordan Pundik's vocal delivery curls into sweetness, rather than a snarl. Wrapped around journal-entry cute lines on the earnestly protective pleadings of \\"It's Not Your Fault.\\" Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine, was of the opinion that \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" displays \\"more maturity - and piano - than ever before. It's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it sours.\\" Jack Foley of Indie London was also favorable of the track and noted \\"the chiming piano chords that open \\"It‚Äôs Not Your Fault\\" give way into an effortlessly inspiring song about young love that unfolds into a majestic chorus.\\" Music video Jordan Pundik (centre) performs onstage during the music video The music video for the single was shot by long term music video director Brett Simon (Sugarcult, Queens of the Stone Age, The Killers). The video depicts the band performing the song live on several occasions (see screenshot), in between a story being revealed in reverse chronological order. The story portrays a man and woman (played by Teddy Van Deusen and Heide Lindgren from the American reality show 8th & Ocean), who wake up in bed naked together, and proceed to retrace their steps and retain their several items of clothing along the way. At the climax of the video, they end up where they first met in a record store and go their separate ways. The concept itself was inspired by a German mobile phone commercial. The video idea came from the Axe/Lynx 24-7 spot, \\"Because you never know when (Getting Dressed)\\", that won \\"Gold Lion Cannes 2004\\" award. Chad Gilbert told Kerrang! magazine that, \\"It starts backwards, with a guy and a girl in bed naked, and then they put on their clothes, finding them strewn as they walk, until they get to their first meeting at the end. We just took the idea and went with it.\\" The shoot was completed in one afternoon. Track listing All songs written, composed and performed by New Found Glory.

Wood and Paul Newman provides specialized programs and year-round support for children and their families dealing with life-threatening illnesses. The Ranch's purpose is to enrich their lives and provide camp experiences that are memorable, exciting, fun, empowering, physically safe and medically sound. A fundamental principle of the camp is that no child should be denied the joys of childhood due to an illness or physical limitation, nor should they be restricted due to a family‚Äôs financial situation. Thus, all programs are free of charge. The Double H relies on the support of individuals, corporations, civic organizations and foundations. In the summer camp program, children with life- threatening and debilitating illnesses which prevent them from attending other camps stay for a week in one of the cabins on site. They can participate in activities such as zip lining, fishing, and white-water rafting. Nurses and medical staff are able to provide all medical care necessary to ensure their safety. The Double H offers activities which essentially define childhood; carefree play, interaction with peers, the expression of creativity through arts, song and sports. Programs allow children with Cancer, Leukemia, Sickle- Cell Anemia, Hemophilia, HIV/AIDS and Neuromuscular impairments the chance to grow both physically and emotionally. In addition to the summer camp experience, Double H Ranch also offers an Adaptive Winter Sports Program. The Winter Program offers children ages 6‚Äì18 with chronic and life-threatening illnesses the opportunity to participate in various winter sports in the beautiful Adirondack Mountains. Activities include alpine and Nordic skiing, as well as snowboarding and snow shoeing. In keeping with its mission, the Double H also provides the venue for weekends sponsored by a number of family based support programs throughout the year. These weekends serve families coping with HIV/AIDS, cancer, the loss of a child or parent, bleeding disorders, spina bifida, a child with autism, and many more. The Double H hosts several major events throughout the year to support its programs as well as camper sponsorship fundraising initiatives. The Double H offers numerous volunteer opportunities and corporate sponsorships in support of its campers.

Washington, DC, The National Academies Press, 150 p. https://doi.org/10.17226/25473 State and federal agency responsibilities The Clean Water Act requires that state environmental agencies complete TMDLs for impaired waters and that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review and approve / disapprove those TMDLs. Because both state and federal governments are involved in completing TMDLs, the TMDL program is an example of cooperative federalism. If a state doesn't take action to develop TMDLs, or if EPA disapproves state- developed TMDLs, the EPA is responsible for issuing TMDLs. EPA published regulations in 1992 establishing TMDL procedures.EPA. \\"Water Quality Planning and Management: Total maximum daily loads (TMDL) and individual water quality- based effluent limitations\\". Code of Federal Regulations, . Application of TMDLs has broadened significantly in the last decade to include many watershed-scale efforts, including the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. TMDLs identify all point source and nonpoint source pollutants within a watershed. State inventories The Clean Water Act requires states to compile lists of water bodies that do not fully support beneficial uses such as aquatic life, fisheries, drinking water, recreation, industry, or agriculture; and to prioritize those water bodies for TMDL development. These inventories are known as \\"303(d) lists\\" and characterize waters as fully supporting, impaired, or in some cases threatened for beneficial uses. Planning process Beneficial use determinations must have sufficient credible water quality data for TMDL planning. Throughout the U.S., data are often lacking adequate spatial or temporal coverage to reliably establish the sources and magnitude of water quality degradation. TMDL planning in large watersheds is a process that typically involves the following steps: # Watershed Characterization‚Äîunderstanding the basic physical, environmental, and human elements of the watershed. # Impairment Status‚Äîanalyzing existing data to determine if waters fully support beneficial uses # Data Gaps and Monitoring Report‚Äîidentification of any additional data needs and monitoring recommendations # Source Assessment‚Äîidentification of sources of pollutants, and magnitude of sources. # Load Allocation‚Äîdetermination of natural pollutant load, and load from human activities (i.e. diffuse nonpoint sources and point discharges). # Set Targets‚Äîestablishment of water quality targets intended to restore or maintain beneficial uses. # TMDL Implementation Plan‚Äîa watershed management strategy to attain established targets. =Water quality targets= The purpose of water quality targets is to protect or restore beneficial uses and protect human health. These targets may include state/federal numerical water quality standards or narrative standards, i.e. within the range of \\"natural\\" conditions. Establishing targets to restore beneficial uses is challenging and sometimes controversial. For example, the restoration of a fishery may require reducing temperatures, nutrients, sediments, and improving habitat. Necessary values for each pollutant target to restore fisheries can be uncertain. The potential for a water body to support a fishery even in a pristine state can be uncertain. =Background= Calculating the TMDL for any given body of water involves the combination of factors that contribute to the problem of nutrient concentrated runoff. Bodies of water are tested for contaminants based on their intended use. Each body of water is tested similarly but designated with a different TMDL. Drinking water reservoirs are designated differently from areas for public swimming and water bodies intended for fishing are designated differently from water located in wildlife conservation areas. The size of the water body also is taken into consideration when TMDL calculating is undertaken. The larger the body of water, the greater the amounts of contaminants can be present and still maintain a margin of safety. The margin of safety (MOS) is numeric estimate included in the TMDL calculation, sometimes 10% of the TMDL, intended to allow a safety buffer between the calculated TMDL and the actual load that will allow the water body to meet its beneficial use (since the natural world is complex and several variables may alter future conditions). TMDL is the end product of all point and non-point source pollutants of a single contaminant. Pollutants that originate from a point source are given allowable levels of contaminants to be discharged; this is the waste load allocation (WLA). Nonpoint source pollutants are also calculated into the TMDL equation with load allocation (LA). =Calculation= The calculation of a TMDL is as follows: :TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS where WLA is the waste load allocation for point sources, LA is the load allocation for nonpoint sources, and MOS is the margin of safety.Granato, G.E., and Jones, S.C., 2017, Estimating Total Maximum Daily Loads with the Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model: Transportation Research Record, Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 2638, p. 104-112. https://doi.org/10.3141/2638-12 =Load allocations= Load allocations are equally challenging as setting targets. Load allocations provide a framework for determining the relative share of natural sources and human sources of pollution. The natural background load for a pollutant may be imprecisely understood. Industrial dischargers, farmers, land developers, municipalities, natural resource agencies, and other watershed stakeholders each have a vested interest in the outcome . Implementation To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into discharge permits for these sources.EPA. NPDES Permit Writers' Manual. \\"Chapter 6: Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations\\". September 2010. Document No. EPA-833-K-10-001. The permits are issued by EPA or delegated state agencies under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Nonpoint source discharges (e.g. agriculture) are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario. The TMDL implementation plan is intended to help bridge this divide and ensure that watershed beneficial uses are restored and maintained. Local watershed groups play a critical role in educating stakeholders, generating funding, and implementing projects to reduce nonpoint sources of pollution.

However, other Linux kernel developers opposed accepting extensions to ext3 for stability reasons, and proposed to fork the source code of ext3, rename it as ext4, and perform all the development there, without affecting existing ext3 users. This proposal was accepted, and on 28 June 2006, Theodore Ts'o, the ext3 maintainer, announced the new plan of development for ext4. A preliminary development version of ext4 was included in version 2.6.19 of the Linux kernel. On 11 October 2008, the patches that mark ext4 as stable code were merged in the Linux 2.6.28 source code repositories, denoting the end of the development phase and recommending ext4 adoption. Kernel 2.6.28, containing the ext4 filesystem, was finally released on 25 December 2008. On 15 January 2010, Google announced that it would upgrade its storage infrastructure from ext2 to ext4. On 14 December 2010, Google also announced it would use ext4, instead of YAFFS, on Android 2.3. Adoption ext4 is the default file system for many Linux distributions including Debian and Ubuntu. Features ; Large file system : The ext4 filesystem can support volumes with sizes up to 1 exbibyte (EiB) and single files with sizes up to 16 tebibytes (TiB) with the standard 4 KiB block size. The maximum file, directory, and filesystem size limits grow at least proportionately with the filesystem block size up to the maximum 64 KiB block size available on ARM and PowerPC/Power ISA CPUs. ; Extents : Extents replace the traditional block mapping scheme used by ext2 and ext3. An extent is a range of contiguous physical blocks, improving large-file performance and reducing fragmentation. A single extent in ext4 can map up to 128 MiB of contiguous space with a 4 KiB block size. There can be four extents stored directly in the inode. When there are more than four extents to a file, the rest of the extents are indexed in a tree. ; Backward compatibility : ext4 is backward-compatible with ext3 and ext2, making it possible to mount ext3 and ext2 as ext4. This will slightly improve performance, because certain new features of the ext4 implementation can also be used with ext3 and ext2, such as the new block allocation algorithm, without affecting the on-disk format. : ext3 is partially forward- compatible with ext4. Practically, ext4 will not mount as an ext3 filesystem out of the box, unless certain new features are disabled when creating it, such as \`^extent\`, \`^flex_bg\`, \`^huge_file\`, \`^uninit_bg\`, \`^dir_nlink\`, and \`^extra_isize\`. ; Persistent pre-allocation : ext4 can pre-allocate on-disk space for a file. To do this on most file systems, zeroes would be written to the file when created. In ext4 (and some other files systems such as XFS) \`fallocate()\`, a new system call in the Linux kernel, can be used. The allocated space would be guaranteed and likely contiguous. This situation has applications for media streaming and databases. ; Delayed allocation : ext4 uses a performance technique called allocate-on-flush, also known as delayed allocation. That is, ext4 delays block allocation until data is flushed to disk. (In contrast, some file systems allocate blocks immediately, even when the data goes into a write cache.) Delayed allocation improves performance and reduces fragmentation by effectively allocating larger amounts of data at a time. ; Unlimited number of subdirectories : ext4 does not limit the number of subdirectories in a single directory, except by the inherent size limit of the directory itself. (In ext3 a directory can have at most 32,000 subdirectories.) To allow for larger directories and continued performance, ext4 in Linux 2.6.23 and later turns on HTree indices (a specialized version of a B-tree) by default, which allows directories up to approximately 10‚Äì12 million entries to be stored in the 2-level HTree index and 2 GB directory size limit for 4 KiB block size, depending on the filename length. In Linux 4.12 and later the \`largedir\` feature enabled a 3-level HTree and directory sizes over 2 GB, allowing approximately 6 billion entries in a single directory. ; Journal checksums : ext4 uses checksums in the journal to improve reliability, since the journal is one of the most used files of the disk. This feature has a side benefit: it can safely avoid a disk I/O wait during journaling, improving performance slightly. Journal checksumming was inspired by a research article from the University of Wisconsin, titled IRON File Systems (specifically, section 6, called \\"transaction checksums\\"), with modifications within the implementation of compound transactions performed by the IRON file system (originally proposed by Sam Naghshineh in the RedHat summit). ; Metadata checksumming : Since Linux kernel 3.5 released in 2012 ; Faster file-system checking : In ext4 unallocated block groups and sections of the inode table are marked as such. This enables e2fsck to skip them entirely and greatly reduces the time it takes to check the file system. Linux 2.6.24 implements this feature. fsck time dependence on inode count (ext3 vs. ext4) ; Multiblock allocator : When ext3 appends to a file, it calls the block allocator, once for each block. Consequently, if there are multiple concurrent writers, files can easily become fragmented on disk. However, ext4 uses delayed allocation, which allows it to buffer data and allocate groups of blocks. Consequently, the multiblock allocator can make better choices about allocating files contiguously on disk. The multiblock allocator can also be used when files are opened in O_DIRECT mode. This feature does not affect the disk format. ; Improved timestamps : As computers become faster in general, and as Linux becomes used more for mission-critical applications, the granularity of second-based timestamps becomes insufficient. To solve this, ext4 provides timestamps measured in nanoseconds. In addition, 2 bits of the expanded timestamp field are added to the most significant bits of the seconds field of the timestamps to defer the year 2038 problem for an additional 408 years. : ext4 also adds support for time-of-creation timestamps. But, as Theodore Ts'o points out, while it is easy to add an extra creation-date field in the inode (thus technically enabling support for these timestamps in ext4), it is more difficult to modify or add the necessary system calls, like stat() (which would probably require a new version) and the various libraries that depend on them (like glibc). These changes will require coordination of many projects. Therefore, the creation date stored by ext4 is currently only available to user programs on Linux via the \`statx()\` API. ; Project quotas : Support for project quotas was added in Linux kernel 4.4 on 8 Jan 2016. This feature allows assigning disk quota limits to a particular project ID. The project ID of a file is a 32-bit number stored on each file and is inherited by all files and subdirectories created beneath a parent directory with an assigned project ID. This allows assigning quota limits to a particular subdirectory tree independent of file access permissions on the file, such as user and project quotas that are dependent on the UID and GID. While this is similar to a directory quota, the main difference is that the same project ID can be assigned to multiple top-level directories and is not strictly hierarchical. ; Transparent encryption : Support for transparent encryption was added in Linux kernel 4.1 on June 2015. ; Lazy initialization : The lazyinit feature allows to clean inode tables in background, speeding initialization when creating a new ext4 file system. It is available since 2010 in Linux kernel version 2.6.37. ; Write barriers : ext4 enables write barriers by default. It ensures that file system metadata is correctly written and ordered on disk, even when write caches lose power. This goes with a performance cost especially for applications that use fsync heavily or create and delete many small files. For disks with a battery-backed write cache, disabling barriers (option 'barrier=0') may safely improve performance. Limitations In 2008, the principal developer of the ext3 and ext4 file systems, Theodore Ts'o, stated that although ext4 has improved features, it is not a major advance, it uses old technology, and is a stop-gap. Ts'o believes that Btrfs is the better direction because \\"it offers improvements in scalability, reliability, and ease of management\\". Btrfs also has \\"a number of the same design ideas that reiser3/4 had\\". However, ext4 has continued to gain new features such as file encryption and metadata checksums. The ext4 file system does not honor the \\"secure deletion\\" file attribute, which is supposed to cause overwriting of files upon deletion. A patch to implement secure deletion was proposed in 2011, but did not solve the problem of sensitive data ending up in the file-system journal. Delayed allocation and potential data loss Because delayed allocation changes the behavior that programmers have been relying on with ext3, the feature poses some additional risk of data loss in cases where the system crashes or loses power before all of the data has been written to disk. Due to this, ext4 in kernel versions 2.6.30 and later automatically handles these cases as ext3 does. The typical scenario in which this might occur is a program replacing the contents of a file without forcing a write to the disk with fsync. There are two common ways of replacing the contents of a file on Unix systems: * \`fd=open(\\"file\\", O_TRUNC); write(fd, data); close(fd);\` : In this case, an existing file is truncated at the time of open (due to \`O_TRUNC\` flag), then new data is written out. Since the write can take some time, there is an opportunity of losing contents even with ext3, but usually very small. However, because ext4 can delay writing file data for a long time, this opportunity is much greater. : There are several problems that can arise: :# If the write does not succeed (which may be due to error conditions in the writing program, or due to external conditions such as a full disk), then both the original version and the new version of the file will be lost, and the file may be corrupted because only a part of it has been written. :# If other processes access the file while it is being written, they see a corrupted version. :# If other processes have the file open and do not expect its contents to change, those processes may crash. One notable example is a shared library file which is mapped into running programs. :Because of these issues, often the following idiom is preferred over the one above: * \`fd=open(\\"file.new\\"); write(fd, data); close(fd); rename(\\"file.new\\", \\"file\\");\` : A new temporary file (\\"file.new\\") is created, which initially contains the new contents. Then the new file is renamed over the old one. Replacing files by the \`rename()\` call is guaranteed to be atomic by POSIX standards ‚Äì i.e. either the old file remains, or it's overwritten with the new one. Because the ext3 default \\"ordered\\" journaling mode guarantees file data is written out on disk before metadata, this technique guarantees that either the old or the new file contents will persist on disk. ext4's delayed allocation breaks this expectation, because the file write can be delayed for a long time, and the rename is usually carried out before new file contents reach the disk. Using \`fsync()\` more often to reduce the risk for ext4 could lead to performance penalties on ext3 filesystems mounted with the \`data=ordered\` flag (the default on most Linux distributions). Given that both file systems will be in use for some time, this complicates matters for end-user application developers. In response, ext4 in Linux kernels 2.6.30 and newer detect the occurrence of these common cases and force the files to be allocated immediately. For a small cost in performance, this provides semantics similar to ext3 ordered mode and increases the chance that either version of the file will survive the crash. This new behavior is enabled by default, but can be disabled with the \\"noauto_da_alloc\\" mount option. The new patches have become part of the mainline kernel 2.6.30, but various distributions chose to backport them to 2.6.28 or 2.6.29.Ubuntu bug #317781 Long discussion between Ubuntu developers and Theodore Ts'o on potential data loss These patches don't completely prevent potential data loss or help at all with new files. The only way to be safe is to write and use software that does \`fsync()\` when it needs to. Performance problems can be minimized by limiting crucial disk writes that need \`fsync()\` to occur less frequently.Thoughts by Ted blog entry, 12 March 2009 A blog posting of Theodore Ts'o on the subject Implementation Simplified structure of the Linux kernel: ext4 is implemented between the Linux kernel Virtual File System and the generic block layer. Linux kernel Virtual File System is a subsystem or layer inside of the Linux kernel. It is the result of the very serious attempt to integrate multiple file systems into an orderly single structure. The key idea, which dates back to the pioneering work done by Sun Microsystems employees in 1986,Kleiman is to abstract out that part of the file system that is common to all file systems and put that code in a separate layer that calls the underlying concrete file systems to actually manage the data. All system calls related to files (or pseudo files) are directed to the Linux kernel Virtual File System for initial processing. These calls, coming from user processes, are the standard POSIX calls, such as \`open\`, \`read\`, \`write\`, \`lseek\`, etc. =Compatibility with Windows and Macintosh= ext4 does not, , have as much support as ext2 and ext3 on non- Linux operating systems. ext2 and ext3 have stable drivers such as Ext2IFS, which are not yet available for ext4. It is possible to create compatible ext4 filesystems by disabling the extents feature, and sometimes specifying an inode size. Another option for using ext4 in Windows is to use Ext2Fsd, an open-source driver that supports writing in ext4 partitions with limited journaling. Viewing and copying files from ext4 to Windows, even with extents enabled, is also possible with the Ext2Read software. More recently Paragon released its commercial product ExtFS for Windows which allows read/write capabilities for ext2/3/4. macOS has full ext2/3/4 read‚Äìwrite capability through the Paragon ExtFS software, which is a commercial product. Free software such as ext4fuse has read-only support with limited functionality.

It is applicable to both combinatorial and continuous problems, with either a static or noisy objective. The method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases:Rubinstein, R.Y. and Kroese, D.P. (2004), The Cross-Entropy Method: A Unified Approach to Combinatorial Optimization, Monte-Carlo Simulation, and Machine Learning, Springer-Verlag, New York . #Draw a sample from a probability distribution. #Minimize the cross-entropy between this distribution and a target distribution to produce a better sample in the next iteration. Reuven Rubinstein developed the method in the context of rare event simulation, where tiny probabilities must be estimated, for example in network reliability analysis, queueing models, or performance analysis of telecommunication systems. The method has also been applied to the traveling salesman, quadratic assignment, DNA sequence alignment, max-cut and buffer allocation problems. Estimation via importance sampling Consider the general problem of estimating the quantity \\\\ell = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{u}}[H(\\\\mathbf{X})] = \\\\int H(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\, f(\\\\mathbf{x}; \\\\mathbf{u})\\\\, \\\\textrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}, where H is some performance function and f(\\\\mathbf{x};\\\\mathbf{u}) is a member of some parametric family of distributions. Using importance sampling this quantity can be estimated as \\\\hat{\\\\ell} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N H(\\\\mathbf{X}_i) \\\\frac{f(\\\\mathbf{X}_i; \\\\mathbf{u})}{g(\\\\mathbf{X}_i)}, where \\\\mathbf{X}_1,\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{X}_N is a random sample from g\\\\,. For positive H, the theoretically optimal importance sampling density (PDF) is given by g^*(\\\\mathbf{x}) = H(\\\\mathbf{x}) f(\\\\mathbf{x};\\\\mathbf{u})/\\\\ell. This, however, depends on the unknown \\\\ell. The CE method aims to approximate the optimal PDF by adaptively selecting members of the parametric family that are closest (in the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler sense) to the optimal PDF g^*. Generic CE algorithm # Choose initial parameter vector \\\\mathbf{v}^{(0)}; set t = 1. # Generate a random sample \\\\mathbf{X}_1,\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{X}_N from f(\\\\cdot;\\\\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)}) # Solve for \\\\mathbf{v}^{(t)}, where \\\\mathbf{v}^{(t)} = \\\\mathop{\\\\textrm{argmax}}_{\\\\mathbf{u}} \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N H(\\\\mathbf{X}_i)\\\\frac{f(\\\\mathbf{X}_i;\\\\mathbf{u})}{f(\\\\mathbf{X}_i;\\\\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)})} \\\\log f(\\\\mathbf{X}_i;\\\\mathbf{v}^{(t-1)}) # If convergence is reached then stop; otherwise, increase t by 1 and reiterate from step 2.

To apply CE, one considers first the associated stochastic problem of estimating \\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}(S(X)\\\\geq\\\\gamma) for a given level \\\\gamma\\\\,, and parametric family \\\\left\\\\\\\\{f(\\\\cdot;\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta})\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, for example the 1-dimensional Gaussian distribution, parameterized by its mean \\\\mu_t\\\\, and variance \\\\sigma_t^2 (so \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} = (\\\\mu,\\\\sigma^2) here). Hence, for a given \\\\gamma\\\\,, the goal is to find \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} so that D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(\\\\textrm{I}_{\\\\\\\\{S(x)\\\\geq\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}}\\\\f_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}) is minimized. This is done by solving the sample version (stochastic counterpart) of the KL divergence minimization problem, as in step 3 above. It turns out that parameters that minimize the stochastic counterpart for this choice of target distribution and parametric family are the sample mean and sample variance corresponding to the elite samples, which are those samples that have objective function value \\\\geq\\\\gamma. The worst of the elite samples is then used as the level parameter for the next iteration. This yields the following randomized algorithm that happens to coincide with the so-called Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm (EMNA), an estimation of distribution algorithm. =Pseudocode= // Initialize parameters Œº := ‚àí6 œÉ2 := 100 t := 0 maxits := 100 N := 100 Ne := 10 // While maxits not exceeded and not converged while t < maxits and œÉ2 > Œµ do // Obtain N samples from current sampling distribution X := SampleGaussian(Œº, œÉ2, N) // Evaluate objective function at sampled points S := exp(‚àí(X ‚àí 2) ^ 2) + 0.8 exp(‚àí(X + 2) ^ 2) // Sort X by objective function values in descending order X := sort(X, S) // Update parameters of sampling distribution Œº := mean(X(1:Ne)) œÉ2 := var(X(1:Ne)) t := t + 1 // Return mean of final sampling distribution as solution return mu Related methods * Simulated annealing * Genetic algorithms * Harmony search * Estimation of distribution algorithm * Tabu search * Natural Evolution Strategy See also * Cross entropy * Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence * Randomized algorithm * Importance sampling  Journal papers  * De Boer, P-T., Kroese, D.P, Mannor, S. and Rubinstein, R.Y.

Family background and childhood Francisco Antonio Manzanares, son of Jose Antonio Manzanares and Maria Manuela Valdez, was born in Abiqui√∫, New Mexico, on January 25, 1843. Barely three years later in 1846, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War commenced. By the time he was seven, New Mexico had become a territory of the United States. The Manzanares family held a very prominent place in the community. His parents were from Spanish families that moved to the New Mexico territory during the colonial period. Manzanares' father had supported the Union during the civil war, and afterward, served in the legislative assembly as an Indian Agent. Manzanares grew up with Spanish as his first language, and during his youth attended Taos School under the instruction of Father Antonio Jose Martinez. In 1863 he began attending St. Louis University, where he studied English until 1864. Career in business Manzanares then began his business career with Chick, Browne, and Co. in Kansas City, the birthplace of the firm. He held a sales position there for a brief period, and then quickly relocated to New York City, where he continued his college education. While in New York, Manzanares began working at a bank. He learned valuable skills during his year in New York which resulted in a career leap upon his return to Kansas City. where he was named partner of Chick, Browne, and Co. Throughout his years working for the firm, Manzanares opened a number of markets throughout Kansas Pacific, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway train routes. In 1879, the firm was renamed to Browne and Manzanares, with Manzanares now a full partner. The firm was then moved to Las Vegas, New Mexico. Though New Mexico was still in a period of transition, Manzanares wasted no time in working to boost the economy. With the help of other members in the community, Manzanares planned and founded Las Vegas Waterworks Association. He did not stop there, however, and soon aided in the development of financial infrastructure of the state by opening First National Banks in Las Vegas, Santa Fe, and Raton. A political transition In 1884, Manzanares left the banking business and challenged Republican candidate Tranquilino Luna for a seat in Congress. He won, and served as a territorial delegate to the United States House of Representatives from March 5, 1884 to March 3, 1885. He did not run for re-election. Manzanares was also a member of the board of county commissioners in San Miguel County in 1896 and 1897. He died on September 17, 1904, in Las Vegas, New Mexico.

Temperance hotels' were first established in the UK in the 1850s to provide an alcohol-free alternative to corner pubs and residential hotels, and by the 1870s they could be found in every town and city, some quite large and elaborate. In the late 1870s the idea caught on in Australia, where the appellation \\"coffee palace\\" was almost universal, and dozens were built in the 1880s and early 1890s, including some of the largest hotels in the country. Due to the depression of the mid 1890s, some became ordinary hotels and others were converted to different uses. The name continued to be applied to smaller residential hotels and guest houses in the early 20th century, until the trend died out. As large old hotels that may never have been a financial success, many, including most of the largest, were eventually demolished. History In the 17th and 18th centuries, \\"coffee houses\\", which were like taverns, but sold the new beverage of coffee rather than alcohol, became popular in the United Kingdom, but died out by the late 18th century. Beginning in the early 19th century in the United States, the Temperance movement campaigned against the moral, economical and medical effects of overindulgence in alcoholic beverages, a campaign which soon evolved into the promotion of total abstinence. By the early 1830s the temperance movement began in earnest in the United Kingdom, starting in the north, and soon spread all over the country. The movement built or converted its own premises for meetings, entertainment, food and accommodations, with the first \\"temperance hotel\\" opening in 1833 in Preston, with 22 across the north and the Midlands by 1835 (though not all offered accommodation). Intended as an alternative to the corner pub, they were often about the same size, and just about every town of any size soon had at least one. As well as \\"temperance hotel\\", many other names were used such as temperance bar, coffee tavern, coffee rooms, temperance tavern, or just a named hotel that was advertised as a temperance venue. In the 1870s, with an established market, larger and more elaborate temperance hotels began to be built, a trend which continued into the 1880s, and some of these were called a \\"coffee palace\\". Examples included the 1872 French Renaissance style Trevelyan Temperance Hotel, Boar Lane, Leeds, and the Cobden Coffee Palace, Corporation Street, Birmingham, built in 1883 in a striking Gothic Revival style (demolished). The Temperance movement in Australia was established shortly after its beginnings in the UK, for instance, the temperance society in Melbourne was formed in 1837. This was followed by the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society in 1842, the Independent Order of Rechabites in 1847, and in 1885 the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Tankard's Temperance Hotel, an alcohol-free residential hotel, was established in the 1850s, in the western end of the city. In Australia, the same imperative for their construction applied as in the UK, as expressed at a meeting at the Melbourne Temperance Hall in October 1878, to build a place \\"... as attractive as possible for the working man, [which] should combine every facility for harmless amusement and intellectual enjoyment, with the advantages of a large hotel, the only difference being that coffee should be vended instead of intoxicating liquors\\". A major point of difference to the UK examples however was that they were built \\"on a business basis\\" rather than as a subsidised or not for profit venture. The first \\"coffee house\\" companies were founded soon after that meeting in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and the first to be built, the Collingwood Coffee Palace, opened in Smith Street, Fitzroy in 1879, closely followed by the gladly ornate Melbourne Coffee Palace in the city in 1881. The Melbourne Coffee Palace, built in Bourke Street in 1881, was one of the earliest truly grand coffee palaces in Australia, featuring ornate interiors such as a grand dining room Their promotion occurred at a time of great economic growth in Australia, which perhaps combined with the \\"moral superiority\\" behind them, led to their rapid popularity and the construction of many often quite large and elaborate \\"temperance hotels\\" in the following decade, nearly always called Coffee Palaces. The greatest growth occurred in Melbourne, then in the throes of a \\"land boom\\", with land rising steeply in value and large buildings built to capitalise on that value. This coincided with the popularity of what is now called High Victorian architecture, lavish buildings with richly ornamented facades and interiors, usually Renaissance Revival, perhaps combined with Second Empire elements. The coffee palaces were invariably built in this elaborate High Victorian style, or in the more form of typical large pub/hotels, with extensive cast-iron verandahs. The Scots Presbyterian James Munro, politician and leading Land Boomer, was a champion of the temperance movement in Victoria; in 1886 he formed a company that purchased an already prominent hotel, the Grand on Spring Street built three years previously, and converted it into a temperance hotel, the Grand Coffee Palace, reputedly burning the liquor licence. The Federal Coffee Palace, built in 1888 on the corner of Collins and King Street in the western end of Melbourne's CBD was the largest hotel built in Australia, and the Grand Coffee Palace at the other end of the city was the second largest in Melbourne, while the Queens Coffee Palace in Carlton was possibly the third (though it appears to never have opened as a hotel, instead becoming residential apartments). In Sydney the Grand Central Coffee Palace built in 1889 was almost as big the contemporary Metropole and Australia Hotels, but they were the better known and patronised. The boom lasted a little more than a decade, ending with the banking crisis of 1893, and a severe economic depression. The coffee palaces lost custom to the licensed hotels they were sometimes built to compete with, while others were built for patrons that never came, and so struggled to survive. Some were converted into guest houses or private hotels (or in one case a school), while others applied for liquor licences and dropped the \\"coffee palace\\" title. The \\"coffee palace\\" title was however taken up in the early 20th century for usually small residential hotels / guest houses, often in resort or country towns, to indicate they were not licensed, but they fell short of the grandeur the name implied (such as the 1901 Yarram Coffee Palace, about the size of a corner pub). The larger examples were essentially large Victorian-era hotels with numerous small rooms, and those that had not continued as hotels often became cheap boarding houses by the mid 20th century, especially in the Melbourne suburbs, and a large number were demolished from the 1950s-1970s. Some significant examples still survive, though very few still operate as hotels. The most famous survivor is the Hotel Windsor, the renamed Grand Coffee Palace that James Munro had established, which re-gained its liquor licence in 1897, and changed name in 1920, and is Australia's major surviving grand 19th century hotel.

Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p. 14) and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in 1933 under the title The Tuesday Club Murders.John Cooper and B.A. Pyke. Detective Fiction ‚Äì the collector's guide: Second Edition (pp. 82, 87) Scholar Press. 1994; The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The thirteen stories feature the amateur detective Miss Marple, her nephew Raymond West, and her friend Sir Henry Clithering. They are the earliest stories Christie wrote about Miss Marple. Plot introduction As in some of her other short story collections (e.g. Partners in Crime), Christie employs an overarching narrative, making the book more like an episodic novel. There are three sets of narratives, though they themselves interrelate. The first set of six are stories told by the Tuesday Night Club, a random gathering of people at the house of Miss Marple. Each week the group tell tales of mystery, always solved by the female amateur detective from the comfort of her armchair. One of the guests is Sir Henry Clithering, an ex-Commissioner of Scotland Yard, and this allows Christie to resolve the story, with him usually pointing out that the criminals were caught. Sir Henry Clithering invites Miss Marple to a dinner party, where the next set of six stories are told. The group of guests employ a similar guessing game, and once more Miss Marple triumphs. The thirteenth story, Death by Drowning, takes place some time after the dinner party when Miss Marple finds out that Clithering is staying in St Mary Mead and asks him to help in the investigation surrounding the death of a local village girl. At the start of the story Miss Marple secretly works out who the murderer is and her solution proves correct. Plots =The Tuesday Night Club= A group of friends are meeting at the house of Miss Marple in St Mary Mead. As well as the old lady herself, there is her nephew ‚Äì the writer Raymond West ‚Äì the artist Joyce Lempri√®re, Sir Henry Clithering (a former Scotland Yard commissioner), a clergyman called Dr Pender, and Mr Petherick, a solicitor. The conversation turns to unsolved mysteries; Raymond, Joyce, Pender, and Petherick all claim that their professions are ideal for solving crimes. Joyce suggests that they form a club; every Tuesday night, a member of the group must tell of a real mystery, and the others will attempt to solve it. Sir Henry agrees to participate, and Miss Marple brightly volunteers herself to round out the group. Sir Henry tells the first story of three people who sat down to a supper after which all of them fell ill, supposedly of food poisoning, and one died as a result. The three people were a Mr and Mrs Jones and the wife's companion, Miss Clark, and it was Mrs Jones who died. Mr Jones was a commercial traveller; a maid in one of the hotels in which he stayed saw blotting paper he had used to write a letter, whose decipherable phrases referred to his dependency on his wife's money, her death, and \\"hundreds and thousands\\". The maid read of the death in a paper and, knowing relatives in the same village where Mr and Mrs Jones lived, wrote to them. This started a chain of gossip which led to the exhumation of the body and the discovery that Mrs Jones was poisoned with arsenic. There was further gossip linking Mr Jones to the doctor's daughter, but there was nothing substantive there. The Jones's maid, Gladys, tearfully confirmed that all three people had been served the same meal of tinned lobster, bread and cheese, and trifle. She had also prepared a bowl of corn-flour for Mrs Jones to calm her stomach, but Miss Clark ate this, despite the diet she was on for her consistent weight problems. Jones also had a plausible explanation for the letter which was blotted in the hotel room. The people in the room deliver their various theories as to who the murderer is, but neglect to ask Miss Marple, until Sir Henry politely points out the omission. Miss Marple witters on about a similar case involving a local family (to which Raymond cannot see any relevance) until she suddenly asks Sir Henry if Gladys confessed, and says that she hopes Mr Jones will hang for what he made the poor girl do. The letter in the hotel room was to Gladys. Hundreds and thousands refers to sweets sprinkled atop the dessert; Mr Jones had mixed arsenic with them and given them to Gladys to use for the trifle. Miss Clark had not eaten the dessert (due to her diet) and Mr Jones scraped off the poisoned sweets. Sir Henry confirms that Miss Marple is correct. Mr Jones had got Gladys pregnant and used a promise of marriage after his wife's death to induce the girl to commit murder. He then married someone else. The baby died shortly after its birth and Gladys confessed while dying. =The Idol House of Astarte= The group meets the following week and it is the turn of Dr Pender to tell his story. His tale is one in which a man was struck down by \\"no human agency\\". It took place at a house on the edge of Dartmoor called \\"Silent Grove\\" which was newly purchased by Sir Richard Haydon, an old college friend of the doctor's. Dr Pender was invited to a house party there, where they were joined by seven other people including a striking society beauty named Diana Ashley. Sir Richard was much attracted to her, as were most of the other men in the party, and she bewitched them all in turn. On the moor outside the house were several relics of the Stone Age and within the grounds of the house was a grove of trees which Sir Richard fancied was an authentic grove of Astarte, in the centre of which he had built a rough temple in the form of a stone summerhouse. Diana Ashley was enthused enough by the grove and the structure it contained to wildly suggest a moonlit orgy to the goddess of the Moon, a suggestion which, unsurprisingly, was vetoed by Dr Pender and some of the others, part of their objection being a feeling of evil that the setting provoked in their imaginations. Toned down to a fancy dress party, Diana's suggestion was accepted by the others to take place that night, and preparations happily took place. Diana's shapeless dress, titled 'the unknown', disappointed the group for its lack of imagination, and during the party she disappeared, last being seen heading towards the grove. The others followed and found her in her true costume, magnificently adorned in the moonlight as a priestess of Astarte. She warned the others not to approach but Sir Richard did and promptly collapsed on the ground. When he was examined by his cousin, Elliot, and then Dr Symonds, they found he was dead, killed by a stab to the heart, but no one was seen to approach him and no weapon was found on the grassy floor. They took the body into the house and the police were called. Not satisfied, Elliot went back alone to the grove to investigate further and later the others found him struck down in the same spot with a knife wound in his shoulder and the knife in his hand. His story was one of seeing an illusion of the goddess and then being struck down himself. The knife was identified as one dug up from a barrow on the moor, which was kept in Sir Richard's house. The police suspected Diana but had no proof or explanation as to how she could have committed the crime. The members of the Tuesday Club debate possible solutions between them but Miss Marple hits on the correct one: although she does not know what caused Sir Richard to stumble ‚Äì possibly a trip over a tree root ‚Äì it was his cousin Elliot who quickly stabbed him in the pretence of examining him. The knife was hidden as part of his fancy dress costume. Dr Pender confirms that five years later, Elliot wrote to him on the eve of an expedition to the South Pole admitting the crime and the torment he has suffered since. His motive was love for Diana Ashley, and by killing his cousin he both removed a rival and inherited his wealth. He hoped to atone for his crime and assuage his guilt by dying honourably, which the clergyman confirms he did. =Ingots of Gold= Raymond West takes his turn in telling a story. It took place two years earlier when Raymond spent Whitsun in Cornwall with a recent acquaintance called John Newman. He was something of an authority on the Spanish Armada and had bought the salvage rights to a shipwreck from the Armada which sank off the coast and eluded many attempts at recovery over the years. Travelling by train to Newman's house in the village of Polperran, Raymond shared a carriage with Police Inspector Badgworth who knew of the Spanish treasure trove but was specifically interested in the more recent wreck of a ship called the RMS Otranto. The latter sank six months earlier and its bullion had either been removed from the ship's strongroom after the hull had been torn open on the rocks of Serpent's Point, or stolen some time before. The Inspector was investigating the matter. Arriving in Cornwall, Raymond settled into Newman's house and the following day went with him to the local pub, The Three Anchors, where he immediately felt suspicious of the landlord, Mr Kelvin, who made meaningful comments about the police and other \\"foreigners\\" looking into local matters. The next day, Sunday, saw a storm brewing over the area, and this coincided with Raymond having a feeling of foreboding. This feeling was justified when Newman went out for a walk that night and failed to return, although his disappearance was not noticed until the following day. A search was set up and the missing man was found bound and gagged in a local ditch. His story was that he spotted some men bringing something onto a beach by boat in a local spot appropriately called \\"Smuggler's Cove\\" and then putting the cargo into a local cave. The men set upon him, bound him and drove him to the ditch in a lorry. Badgworth found evidence that the cave had been used to store something but, more importantly, tyre tracks on the route on which Newman was taken matched a tyre on a lorry owned by Mr Kelvin. A night nurse of a neighbour testified the lorry was never taken out of its garage on the night in question. Kelvin evaded arrest and Raymond didn't know the solution to the mystery. Again it is Miss Marple who hits on the solution, when she admonishes her nephew on his choice of friends, and Sir Henry confirms that he knows something of the case and that the old lady is right. Newman is not the man's real name and he is now in Princetown Prison for the theft of gold from a London strongroom. He used the wreck and smuggling story to cover his tracks and Kelvin was set up as a scapegoat. The landlord's lorry was never used, but a tyre was taken off it during the night and put on another lorry to provide the \\"evidence\\". Newman's accomplice was probably his gardener whom Raymond saw working on a bed of rose trees on the Monday morning when they realised Newman was \\"missing\\" ‚Äì as Miss Marple states, real gardeners never work on Whit Monday! =The Blood-Stained Pavement= Joyce Lempri√®re's story also takes place in Cornwall, in the picturesque village of Rathole. One morning, she was painting a picture of the Polharwith Arms when two cars drew up within a couple of minutes of each other. The first contained a couple and the second a scarlet-dressed woman. The man in the couple, \\"Denis\\", recognised the lone woman as \\"Carol\\", an old friend, and introduced her to his somewhat plain wife, \\"Margery\\". As Joyce worked on her canvas she overheard the conversation of the three people, and Denis's suggestion of hiring a rowboat to take them round the coast to a local cave. Carol, disliking boats, agreed to walk to the spot and meet the couple there. That afternoon Joyce had returned to her canvas in front of the pub, spotted two bathing suits drying in the sun from the balcony of the pub, and assumed that the three people had returned. A local man engaged her in somewhat unwanted conversation and distracted her from her work. Before she realised what she had done, she seemed to have painted in bloodstains on the pavement in front of the pub, and was astonished to find that she had captured reality ‚Äì there did seem to be bloodstains on the pavement that were not there a short time before. Before she could take any action, Denis emerged from the pub and asked Joyce and the local man if they had seen Carol return. The three had met at the cave, as agreed, and Carol had supposedly walked back to Rathole but not arrived, although her car was still there. Denis and Margery drove off and Joyce inspected the pavement ‚Äì only to find the bloodstains gone. Two days later, she read in the paper that Margery had disappeared while bathing in the sea, and a week later her body was found washed up with a blow to the head, supposedly caused when she dived into the water on some rocks. The men in the Tuesday Club feel that there is very little in the story to go on, but Miss Marple points out that they do not appreciate the point about clothes as she and Joyce do. The bloodstains were on the pavement, dripping from one of the bathing suits, which was scarlet in colour. The criminals didn't realise that when they hung them up to dry. Joyce confirms her point and finishes the story: a year later, at an east coast resort, she saw the same set up again with Denis, Carol and another woman, supposedly Denis's new wife. Although she didn't know exactly what was happening, Joyce went to the police station and reported suspicious activity. A Scotland Yard inspector was already there investigating Denis who, under several names, had married women, insured their lives for large sums, and then killed them in a conspiracy with Carol ‚Äì his real wife. The woman Joyce saw in Rathole at the time that the bloodstains were on the pavement wasn't Margery but Carol in disguise. When they killed the real Margery during the trip to the cave, blood must have got onto the scarlet bathing suit. =Motive v. Opportunity= Mr Petherick tells his story, which has a legal background. A client of his, whom he calls \\"Simon Clode\\", was a wealthy man who had one son who was killed in the First World War and left an orphaned granddaughter who in turn died when she was a child, leaving the old man bereft and grief-stricken. A brother of his had also recently died and his three children, Grace, Mary and George ‚Äì all grown-up by the time of the story ‚Äì came to live with Simon. His will left his estate to these three in equal shares. Grace married but lived nearby with her husband, Philip. George found employment in a bank, while Mary stayed behind to care for Simon. The old man still pined for his granddaughter and found himself under the influence of an American spiritualist, Mrs Eurydice Spragg, and her husband, Absalom. Mrs Spragg conducted many s√©ances, in which \\"Simon Clode\\" 'contacted' his granddaughter, and the Spraggs were virtually resident in the house. Alarmed by this, Mr Petherick visited his client and then suggested to Grace's husband, Philip, that a noted professor on the subject of spiritualism be invited to the house to witness the s√©ances. This happened, with the result that the professor stated that the Spraggs were frauds. At hearing this, \\"Simon Clode\\" threw Philip out of the house in a fit of anger. The old man then fell ill and was near death. He instructed Petherick to attend him to draw up a new will leaving five thousand pounds to each of his nieces and nephews and the greater part to the Spraggs. As the old man lay in his bed, Petherick tried to dissuade Clode against the terms of the new will but to no avail. Two servants were summoned and instructed to fetch a pen and witness the new will, which Clode wrote out himself and gave to Petherick for safekeeping. After this part of the business had been concluded, Petherick went downstairs for tea and to help George Clode with some matters to do with the estate. During this period, Petherick left his overcoat where only Mrs Spragg could have gained access to the envelope with the will in it. Petherick took it to his office where he was soon visited by Mr Spragg, who was left alone with the will for a few moments. Two months later, Clode died. When the will was opened, the sheet was blank. Petherick's problem was that Mrs Spragg had the opportunity to change the will, but the will was already in her favour, so she had the opportunity but no motive. George had the motive but no opportunity, as when he had access to the will Mr Petherick was present; thus George had motive but no opportunity. Miss Marple again guesses the solution ‚Äì the pen used to write out the will contained a solution of starch in water with a few drops of iodine in it (i.e. disappearing ink). Petherick confirms that Philip confessed as much in a guarded conversation they had had a month later. The house servants were told which pen to fetch for Simon Clode if it looked like he was going to be signing a legal form, and they complied. The three children gained their rightful inheritance. =The Thumb Mark of St. Peter= The final story to be told at the regular meeting of the Tuesday Club comes from Miss Marple herself. It concerns a niece of hers called Mabel who obstinately married Geoffrey Denman when she was twenty-two, despite Denman having a violent temper and a history of insanity in his family. Ten years later he died, and Miss Marple wrote to offer to stay with her niece for a while, but received a reply back that politely refused the offer. Three months later a second letter was sent to her aunt hysterically begging her to come. Arriving at her niece's house, which Mabel shared with two servants ‚Äì hers and a nursemaid for her mentally-ill father-in-law ‚Äì Miss Marple learned that the widow was the subject of gossip to the effect that she had murdered her husband, and no one in the area would now talk to her. Geoffrey had been taken ill in the night and died soon after the doctor arrived, but the old locum had not raised the alarm about the manner of death. It was thought that he had died after eating poisoned mushrooms. The two servants told Miss Marple that Denman had been unable to swallow and was rambling before he died about fish. An exhumation order was granted, followed by an autopsy that proved totally inconclusive. Miss Marple began to wonder if Geoffrey had committed suicide and used a knowledge of medicine gained in a previous period of his life to do so. Totally stumped by the problem, she was in the high street and in something of a silent prayer for guidance when she opened her eyes and saw a fresh haddock in the fishmonger's window with its characteristic black spots known as the \\"thumb mark of St. Peter\\". She realised that the solution lay in the mysterious words uttered by Geoffrey as he lay dying. Questioning the servants further, they stated that the words were to do with a \\"heap\\" or \\"pile\\" of some fish whose name probably began with \\"c\\". Checking a list of poisons, Miss Marple found one called Pilocarpine and read that it is also an antidote for atropine poisoning. Based on her own eyedrops, which contain atropine sulphate, she confronted the elderly Mr Denman and accused him of murdering his son. The insane man laughingly confessed the crime, committed because he overheard that his son was planning to put him in an asylum. He emptied his eye solution into his son's bedside glass of water knowing Geoffrey would drink it during the night. Mr Denman is committed to an asylum after all and the Tuesday Club congratulates Miss Marple on her success, although Raymond points out there is one thing she doesn't know. His aunt corrects him ‚Äì she knows that he proposed to Joyce earlier in the evening! =The Blue Geranium= A year has passed and Sir Henry Clithering is once again in St Mary Mead staying as a guest of Colonel Arthur Bantry and his wife, Dolly. Asked for suggestions as to a sixth person for dinner, he names Miss Marple and tells an incredulous Dolly of her success at solving last year's mysteries. Dolly wonders if the old lady could solve a ghost mystery of Arthur's. Miss Marple duly arrives at the Bantry home along with Sir Henry, an actress called Jane Helier, and Dr Lloyd. Arthur Bantry tells of a friend, George Pritchard, whose late wife was a difficult and cantankerous semi- invalid looked after by a succession of nurses. They changed regularly, unable to cope with their patient, with one exception called Nurse Copling who somehow managed the tantrums and complaints better than others of her calling. Mrs Pritchard had a predilection for fortunetellers, and one day one who called herself Zarida came to the house when both George and Nurse Copling were out of the house on their separate business. Arriving back home, Mrs Pritchard told George that Zarida had declared the house to be \\"evil\\" and to avoid blue flowers. Two days later a letter arrived from the fortuneteller that said, \\"Beware of the Full Moon. The Blue Primrose means warning; the Blue Hollyhock means danger; the Blue Geranium means death.\\" Four days later, one of the primroses in the pattern of the wallpaper in Mrs Pritchard's room changed colour to blue in the middle of the night, when there had been a full moon. A month went by with Mrs Pritchard counting down the days to the next full moon. Sure enough, the same thing happened, with a hollyhock on the wallpaper changing colour, although the door was locked. Another month passed, with Nurse Copling and Pritchard growing increasingly nervous while Mrs Pritchard seems resigned. The morning after the next full moon, Mrs Pritchard was found dead in her bed, her smelling salts beside her, a faint smell of gas in the room and a geranium on the wallpaper turned blue. There was gossip following the death and an exhumation, but no clear result. Moreover, Zarida had disappeared and no one could properly trace how Mrs Pritchard had come to hear of her. Once again Miss Marple has the solution. Having once seen a gardener mixing potassium cyanide with water to kill wasps, she was struck by how closely the solution resembled smelling salts. If such a solution had been substituted for the bottle Mrs Pritchard always kept by her, the cyanide would have killed her, but the gas would have covered the short-lived smell of almonds. The flowers on the wall were red litmus paper which the ammonia ‚Äì as an alkaloid ‚Äì in the true smelling salts turned blue. Nurse Copling, who was Zarida in disguise, was the killer, in the hopes (which did not come to pass) of marrying the widower Pritchard. Sir Henry confirms that Nurse Copling was recently arrested for a similar murder. =The Companion= Dr Lloyd is called upon to tell his story, and it begins in Las Palmas on the island of Gran Canaria. The doctor was living there for his health, and one night, in the principal hotel of the town, he caught sight of two middle-aged ladies, one slightly plump, one somewhat scraggy, whom he found out from a perusal of the hotel register were called Miss Mary Barton and Miss Amy Durrant, and who were tourists from England. The very next day, Dr Lloyd travelled to the other side of the island with friends for a picnic and, reaching the bay of Las Nieves, the group came upon the end of a tragedy: Miss Durrant had been swimming and got into trouble, and Miss Barton swam out to help her but to no avail; the other woman drowned. As part of the ensuing investigation, Miss Barton revealed that Miss Durrant was her companion of some five months. Dr Lloyd was puzzled by the claim made by one of the witnesses who swore that she saw Miss Barton holding Miss Durant's head under the water, not helping her, but the claim was dismissed as none of the other witnesses backed up the story. Dr Lloyd helped Miss Barton attempt to trace next-of-kin, but without success, and he also helped arrange the funeral, which took place on the island. Before she left Gran Canaria ten days later, Miss Barton asked Dr Lloyd several strange questions regarding the justification of taking the law into one's own hands. Miss Marple is interested to know if Miss Barton suddenly put on weight during this period and the doctor confirms that she had done so. Some time later, Dr Lloyd read in the papers that Miss Barton drowned in Cornwall, although the body was never found. She left a suicide note which seemed to confess to some crime, and the inquest ruled that she was temporarily insane. Miss Marple, comparing the tale to that of a local fraudster called Mrs Trout, who claimed several dead people's old age pensions, states that \\"Miss Barton\\" was a clever criminal who drowned the other woman and then assumed her identity ‚Äì hence the reason she looked fat ‚Äì she was simply wearing the other person's clothes. The really significant fact was that the body in Cornwall was never found ‚Äì this was another part of the deception. Dr Lloyd confirms that he met the lady again coincidentally in Melbourne, Australia. Miss Barton was, in fact, Miss Durrant. Two tourists would not have been known to anyone, and no one realised who was the employer and who was the companion in Gran Canaria. The two women were cousins. Miss Durrant was the eldest of nine children in desperate straits, with some suffering ill-health. They wrote to their relative in England for help, but she refused due to a family quarrel from years earlier. Miss Durrant travelled to England under this assumed name and found employment with Miss Barton, whom she then killed and whose guise she adopted in Gran Canaria. Faking her death in Cornwall, she and her siblings inherited her money as next-of-kin. Dr Lloyd met with the Durrant family and realised the harm he would cause them by reporting their elder sister to the police for a crime for which he had little evidence. Six months later, Miss Durrant died. =The Four Suspects= Sir Henry Clithering tells his story, still a puzzle to him. There are four suspects, three of whom are therefore as much victims as the real victim in that they are under constant suspicion. It concerns a German secret society, the Schwartze Hand, started after the war, with methods and objectives similar to those of the Camorra. Dr Rosen, prominent in secret service work, penetrated the organisation and managed to bring about its downfall. Despite this success, he was a marked man and came to England, living in a cottage in Somerset, expecting he might be murdered. His household comprised his niece Greta, an old servant named Gertrud, a local gardener called Dobbs, and Dr Rosen's secretary, Charles Templeton, whom Clithering reveals was one of his own men, put in the house to keep an eye on things (but possibly not totally above suspicion). The tragedy occurred when Dr Rosen was found at the bottom of the stairs, possibly having fallen down, possibly having been pushed. The four people in the locked house were out at the time, but none can produce an alibi for the time of the death. In addition, no strangers were seen in the vicinity, where they would easily have stood out and been spotted, therefore one of the four must be guilty. One puzzle is how the killer received his or her instructions. The only people to come to the house that day were the butcher, the grocer's assistant, and the postman. The latter brought several letters for various members of the house, including a gardening catalogue and a letter for Charles Templeton which appeared to have been sent from relatives in Germany. Templeton ripped it up and threw it away. Of the letters the police were able to examine, the strangest was one addressed to Dr Rosen himself which was from someone called \\"Georgine\\" and mentioned several people of whom Rosen had never heard. Sir Henry shows the group the letter and Miss Marple wonders why the word \\"Honesty\\", which appears in the middle of a sentence, is spelt with a capital letter. Three months after the death of her uncle, Greta Rosen went back to Germany, but not before seeing Sir Henry and asking him to confirm that Charles was above suspicion. Sir Henry was unable to do so. Miss Marple and Mrs Bantry point out that the three people in the letter and the one place name, together with the word \\"Honesty\\", are all species of dahlias and that, rearranged, they spell \\"Death\\". This was the instruction to kill Dr Rosen, and it was sent to the intended victim himself to divert suspicion from the assassin. Receiving a letter from someone he did not know, he would naturally give it to the other people at the breakfast table to read, one being Charles, the secretary and natural suspect, but the other being his niece, the assassin. Her visit to Sir Henry to try and clear Charles's name was intended to have the opposite effect. Miss Marple also remembers, from her childhood German governess, that \\"Georgine\\" is German for \\"Dahlia\\", and that dahlias are symbolic of \\"Treachery and Misrepresentation\\". =A Christmas Tragedy= The ladies are prevailed upon to tell a story, and Miss Marple relates a tale from a time when she was staying at Keston Spa Hydro just before Christmas. Feeling that older and more experienced people's feelings and intuitions are too often easily dismissed when such feelings are based on facts and experience, she relates how, when she saw a couple called Jack and Gladys Sanders together, she just knew that the husband meant to murder his wife. The motive was money; they were living off her income but could not touch the capital in her lifetime, but she could will the money away and had done so in favour of her husband. Miss Marple's feelings were confirmed when she shared a tram ride with the couple and witnessed Mr Sanders \\"tripping\\" on the stairs onto his wife who then fell down, but was fortunately saved by the conductor. The atmosphere of on-coming tragedy was heightened when the hall porter died from pneumonia, followed soon after by one of the hydro's housemaids who died of blood poisoning. Miss Marple dates the tragedy from when Mr Sanders overheard her and two other ladies talking about this latter death. His wife was out playing bridge with friends, and early in the evening Mr Sanders returned from a trip out with two of his friends and asked Miss Marple and the other ladies' opinions on an evening bag that he'd bought for his wife as a Christmas present. They went up to his room and saw the body of Mrs Sanders on the floor, felled by a sandbag. Immediately suspicious, Miss Marple refused to allow the husband to touch the body, and insisted the door be locked and the police called. Miss Marple noticed the woman's hat was lying beside the body, although previously she had been wearing it. Prompted by the police, she also noticed that the dead woman was no longer wearing earrings, as she had been when the body was first discovered. Mrs Sanders's other jewellery was missing, and the police were certain the thief came back after killing the woman and gained entry by means of the fire escape. Mrs Sanders had been summoned back to the hydro from her bridge game by a mysterious telephone call, but her husband had a perfect alibi for the time in question, that is after she had left the bridge game but before the discovery of the body. It took Miss Marple two days to guess the truth; she then asked the police to try the discarded hat on the dead woman's head ‚Äì it didn't fit. She realised that the body they saw and quickly locked in the room when they first discovered it was not that of Mrs Sanders, but that of the dead housemaid, which was awaiting collection by the undertakers. Sanders had put the body there when his wife was playing bridge, and then rushed into the grounds after the \\"discovery\\", supposedly overcome with grief. There he had met his wife returning from the game, summoned by him on the telephone using an alias, somehow persuaded her up to their room by means of the fire escape, killed her, and then swapped the clothes, returning the dead housemaid to her room. The one thing he couldn't do was put the hat back on his wife's head, as her shingled hair meant it didn't fit. The cheap hat they found was the property of the housemaid, as Mrs Sanders's hat cupboard was locked when her husband was placing the dead girl in his room, and a hat was needed to cover the face. Mr Sanders was hanged for his wife's murder. =The Herb of Death= A reluctant Mrs Bantry is prevailed upon to take her turn. She relates how she and her husband were guests of Sir Ambrose Bercy at his house at Clodderham Court. Sage leaves were picked from the garden for dinner that night, but unfortunately foxglove was growing among the sage, and it was also included in the stuffing for the meal of duck. All of the people at dinner were ill but one of them ‚Äì Sir Ambrose's ward, Sylvia Keene ‚Äì died. The inquest heard that death was due to poisoning by digitalis. Among the party was a young man called Jerry Lorimer who was engaged to Sylvia, to the opposition of Sir Ambrose; but, after a year of the engagement, Sir Ambrose had given in. Also there was Maud Wye, supposedly a friend of Jerry, but Mrs Bantry had seen Jerry kissing her one evening. Six months after Sylvia's death, the two were married. Dr Lloyd is puzzled as a fatal poisoning by the use of foxglove leaves ‚Äì if it was an accident ‚Äì is difficult to achieve; the alkaloid has to be extracted with great care and Sir Henry latches onto the main problem of the case, namely: how do you ensure that only your victim dies if you poison everyone, including yourself (assuming the murderer to be one of the house party)? It was Sylvia herself who picked the foxglove leaves and Dr Lloyd wonders if the intended victim was Sir Ambrose, who was prescribed drugs for his heart condition. Miss Marple latches onto this clue and finds the solution ‚Äì Sir Ambrose's drug was digitalin. He planted the foxglove seed among the sage a long time before, and mild poisoning ensued at the dinner party, but somehow he fed his ward further doses at the same time from his own drug, thereby killing her but making it look like an accident. The motive was jealousy ‚Äì he was in love with his ward and determined that she wouldn't marry Lorimer. Mrs Bantry confirms that she received a letter from Sir Ambrose after he died, to be posted to her in the event of his death, in which he confessed to the crime. =The Affair at the Bungalow= Jane Helier, the beautiful but somewhat vacuous actress, is the last to tell a story. Although she attempts to disguise the fact somewhat by using a false name, the others quickly realise that the story is about herself and, slipping up several times, she soon gives up the pretence and continues. She was on tour in a provincial town when she was summoned to a police station. There had been a burglary at a bungalow and a young man called Leslie Faulkener had been arrested. His story was that he was an unsuccessful playwright and had sent one of his efforts to Jane to read. She had written to him to say that she liked it and inviting him to come down to the bungalow to discuss it. He had gone, been shown in by the parlourmaid, met Jane, and drunk a cocktail. The next thing he knew, he was waking up by the roadside. He staggered along and was quickly picked up by the police. The bungalow belonged to Sir Herman Cohen, a rich city gent, and in it he had installed his mistress. She was an actress called Mary Kerr, the wife of another actor, called Claude Leeson (although Jane admits these are not the people's real names). Someone calling herself Miss Kerr had rung up the police, told them the bungalow had been burgled, and described Leslie Faulkener as having visited there earlier that day, but having been refused admittance. He was later seen by a maid as gaining entrance through a window to steal Miss Kerr's jewellery. The police did indeed find the bungalow rifled and a large quantity of jewels missing. Miss Kerr soon returned but denied any knowledge of the affair or even of having rung up the police. Both she and the maid had been summoned away for the day on separate false pretexts and had never been in the bungalow when Mr Faulkener visited (whether by invitation or not). When Jane was brought face to face with Faulkener at the police station, he stated that this was not the woman he met at the bungalow, and the note was proven not to be in Jane's handwriting. Faulkener was released through lack of evidence. Sir Herman tried to hush the matter up but failed, and his wife started divorce proceedings when she found out about the affair with the actress. The guests of the Bantrys try to guess the solution but fail, and are annoyed when Jane claims she does not know the true solution herself. The group disperse for the night, their six stories told, and Miss Marple whispers something in Jane's ear that causes the actress to cry out in shock. Later she confesses to Mrs Bantry that the story she told never happened, but Jane was thinking of carrying out such a scheme against an actress who enticed one of her previous husbands away from her. Jane and her understudy concocted the set-up. Miss Marple's warning was for Jane not to put herself at the mercy of the understudy, who may prove untrustworthy in the future. Jane decides not to proceed with the plan ‚Äì there might be other Miss Marples out there who would find her out. =Death by Drowning= Some time has passed since the six people met at the Bantry home, and Sir Henry is once again a guest there when news reaches the house early one morning that a local girl called Rose Emmott has been found drowned in the river near to the mill. Local gossip was that she was pregnant by a young man called Rex Sandford, who is an architect from London, and the local feeling now is that she killed herself, unable to face her father with the truth. Later in the morning, Sir Henry receives a visit from an upset Miss Marple who tells him that Rose was murdered, and she doesn't want the wrong man to be hanged for the crime. She tells him that while she believes she knows who the murderer is, she has no proof whatsoever. She asks him to investigate for her, just to see what he can make of it, and to attempt to discover if the person she suspects was involved or not. She writes the name of the suspect on a piece of paper and gives it to Sir Henry, who reads it and sets out to investigate. With some reluctance, Sir Henry meets Melchett and Inspector Drewitt, who is investigating the case. By now the police know that the girl did not commit suicide, as bruises have been found on her upper arm where she was grabbed before being thrown in the river, and a small boy walking in the woods nearby on the evening before heard her cry and found her body. Sir Henry joins the two policemen as they continue their investigations. They meet Rose's father who runs the village pub. He definitely thinks Sandford is the murderer. They call on the architect, who confesses that he is the father of the unborn child and that he wrote a note to Rose, suggesting a meeting at the river, when she insisted on speaking with him. He walked through the woods near the river but failed to keep the appointment. He is told that he is the prime suspect in the case, and not to leave his house. To wrap matters up, the three men visit the cottage of a widow, Mrs Bartlett, who has a young lodger, Joe Ellis, staying with her. This young man was besotted with Rose, and he states that he would have married Rose and brought up the baby as his own. At the time of the murder, he was putting up some shelves in Mrs Bartlett's kitchen and she can provide his alibi. At Sir Henry's insistence, they interview the small boy who heard the cry from Rose before she entered the water. He saw Sandford in the woods and thinks he also heard Joe Ellis whistling. He definitely saw two men with what seemed to be a wheelbarrow in the gathering dusk. Sir Henry, defeated in his attempt to clear Sandford, visits Miss Marple, who tells him Mrs Bartlett couldn't have been home on a Friday ‚Äì the night in question. She takes in washing as extra income and on Fridays she takes it round in an old pram. Sir Henry goes back to Mrs Bartlett's where Joe confesses to being in the woods, but denies hurting Rose. He then confronts Mrs Bartlett to the effect that she too was in the woods near the river. The \\"wheelbarrow\\" that was seen was the pram with the washing, and it was Mrs Bartlett who threw Rose in the water, as she herself was in love with Joe. Not wanting to see the young man hanged, she confesses, but is puzzled as to how Sir Henry knew. He recalls the note Miss Marple gave him, naming Mrs Bartlett as the murderer. Continuity In The Tuesday Night Club, Raymond West's future spouse is named as Joyce Lempri√®re, but in later works involving Miss Marple, Joyce is rechristened Joan. Similarly, a guest at the Bantry's household, Doctor Lloyd, is a general practitioner of St. Mary Mead as opposed to the later physician, Doctor Haydock. The change in names is unexplained, maybe as Lloyd retired later on (but in Death by Drowning, the police surgeon is named Haydock). Jane Helier makes a return in Miss Marple's Final Cases, still young and beautiful (despite the forty-seven year difference between the books), in the short story Strange Jest. Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement (8 September 1932) stated, \\"It is easy to invent an improbable detective, like this elderly spinster who has spent all her life in one village, but by no means so easy to make her detections plausible. Sometimes Miss Marple comes dangerously near those detectives with a remarkable and almost superhuman intuition who solve every mystery as if they knew the answer beforehand, but this is not often and Mrs. Christie shows great skill in adapting her problems so that she can find analogies in Miss Marple's surroundings.\\" The review concluded that \\"in general these are all problems to try the intellect rather than the nerves of the reader.\\"The Times Literary Supplement (8 September 1932); pg. 625 Isaac Anderson in The New York Times Book Review (5 March 1933) wrote: \\"The stories are slight in structure, but they present some very pretty problems and introduce us to some truly interesting people.

The Four Suspects received its first true publication in the US in the January 1930 issue (Volume 31, Number 4) of Pictorical Review. The same magazine also printed The Blue Geranium in February 1930 (Volume 31, Number 5) and The Companion in March 1930 (Volume 31, Number 6) under the slightly revised title of Companions. These three instalments were illustrated by De Alton Valentine. The Tuesday Night Club short story received its first book publication in the anthology The Best Detective Stories of the Year 1928, edited by Ronald Knox and H. Harrington and published in the UK by Faber and Faber in 1929 and in the US by Horace Liveright in the same year under the slightly amended title of The Best English Detective Stories of 1928. The storyline of The Companion was later expanded and reworked into a full-length novel, published as A Murder is Announced, the fourth novel to feature Miss Marple. =Book dedication= The dedication of the book reads: \\"To Leonard and Katharine Woolley\\" Leonard Woolley (1880‚Äì1960), knighted in 1935, was a famous British archaeologist who was in the middle of several seasons excavating the ancient city of Ur when he and his wife Katharine (1888‚Äì1945) met Christie in 1928. She was on a solo trip to the Middle East following the painful divorce from her first husband, Archibald Christie. Having read in the Illustrated London News about the progress of the dig, she made a visit there and, unusually for the Woolleys, was made welcome. This special treatment was entirely due to Katharine's admiration for Christie's 1926 novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The situation was further unusual in that Katharine was not a woman that other women found easy to get on with. Incredibly self-centred and difficult, she preferred to surround herself with men whom she then expected would accede to her demands and whims, such as brushing her hair or walking miles to purchase her favourite confectionery, which she would then eat in one sitting, making her sick. She was described by Gertrude Bell as \\"dangerous\\". Katharine's marriage to Leonard was a second marriage for her, her first husband having committed suicide within six months of the marriage in 1919. Christie met her second husband, Max Mallowan, on their dig in 1930 when she returned there, having formed a somewhat fragile relationship with the Woolleys. Max and Agatha's romance required very careful handling as far as the Woolleys were concerned, as they could easily have damaged Max's career. They accepted the news of the engagement, but made Max work to the last moment before the wedding, and refused to allow Agatha to travel with Max to the dig the first season after their marriage, as they had a rule that wives were not allowed. Fortunately, it was Max's last dig with the Woolleys. Christie refers to this incident in Death in the Clouds (1935) and, even more pointedly, based the character of the doomed, unstable Louise Leidner in Murder in Mesopotamia (1936) on Katharine. =Dustjacket blurb= The blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads: > The appearance of Miss Marple in Murder at the Vicarage provided detective > fiction with a new and distinctive character. Miss Marple, that delightfully > clever village spinster who solves the most amazing mysteries quietly and > unobtrusively from her chair by the fireside, appears in each of the stories > comprising The Thirteen Problems. Each story is a little masterpiece of > detection, clever and ingenious, with just that added twist that only Agatha > Christie can give. Television adaptations Three of these short stories have been adapted for television. Elements from The Thumb Mark of Saint Peter were combined with Greenshaw's Folly for the sixth series of Agatha Christie's Marple, starring Julia McKenzie, first airing 20 June 2013. The Blue Geranium was adapted for the fifth series of Agatha Christie's Marple, starring Julia McKenzie, first aired 27 June 2010. The adaptation was considerably embellished from the short story, but still keeps to the core story line. Elements from The Herb of Death were woven into the Agatha Christie's Marple adaptation of The Secret of Chimneys, starring Julia McKenzie, which first aired 20 June 2010. The Secret of Chimneys originally featured Superintendent Battle as the detective; Miss Marple was not a character in the novel.

It is a movie about redemption in which the title character must make amends to his father after being blamed for his grandmother's death while meeting a girl who understands him and his burdens; at the same time, he must also battle against a mafia-like organisation that hates him. The movie was released in Andhra Pradesh on 14 July 2006. It was an average grosser at the box office. The film was later dubbed into Tamil with the same name and Hindi as The Fighterman Ghayal. It was remade into Bengali Bangladesh as Babar Kosom (2007) with Manna & Nipun Akter. Plot Ashok (NTR Jr.) is a mechanic who is thrown out of his house because of his rash actions that have led to the death of his grandmother (Rama Prabha). His father (Prakash Raj) still harbours anger against Ashok despite his good behaviour that has a positive outcome. Ashok then happens to meet an insecure yet talented dancer named Anjali (Sameera Reddy) and fall in love with her. Anjali witnesses a crime involving KK (Sonu Sood), the leader of one of the largest crime syndicates in Andhra Pradesh. KK then tries to ensnare Anjali within his evil plans, while Ashok wages a one- man war against KK's gang. Ashok's friend Rajiv (Rajiv Kanakala) attempts to rescue Anjali, but KK has him killed. Ashok then avenges Rajiv's death by killing KK's sidekick. This enrages KK, and his gang captures Ashok's sister (Revathi), demanding that Ashok hands himself over to them in return for her safety. Ashok's father drags him to KK's manor and orders him to save his sister. Ashok and KK then get into a dramatic fight at Ashok's sister's wedding. Just when it appears that Ashok will emerge the winner, KK's mother (Vadivukkarasi) tries to shoot Ashok but accidentally kills her own son. She drops the gun and falls down dead, apparently dying of shock. The film ends with Ashok's sister getting married and Ashok receiving his father's forgiveness.

History Its first certainly known male ancestor, Knight Peder Klasson (Sir Peder Fleming), is documented living yet in 1406. He came from Denmark to Sweden during the early reign of king Eric XIII of Sweden and is buried in the Riddarholm Church, Stockholm. He was probably son of a Claus Fleming who between 1331 and 1354 is mentioned as bailiff of Barth in the Pomeranian principality of R√ºgen (a Danish fief) and had in principle the same Coat of Arms. The name of the family denotes some of its origin to Flanders. When having first settled in the eastern part of Sweden (modern-day Finland), they soon became assimilated with the country, having married from among natives and grown into local societal activities. They inherited Louhisaari manor (in Swedish Villn√§s) in Finland Proper (located in the modern-day municipality of Masku). The family was one of the most prominent in Finland at the end of Middle Ages. The then head of the house, sir Lars Fleming (died 1562), governor of the Stockholm Palace, was among the first ones to ever be created friherre in Sweden, which took place in the coronation of Eric XIV of Sweden on 29 June 1561. Baron Lars got the title Baron of Nynes (Nyn√§s) from one of his maternally inherited manors. His male line became extinct on 5 January 1569. His cousin, sir Klaus Eriksson Fleming (died 1535-1597), member of the Privy Council of Sweden, afterwards Lord High Admiral of Sweden, Lord High Constable of Sweden (marsk) and Governor General of Finland, was created on 2 August 1569 baron of the barony of Vik. His male line became extinct in the √Öbo Bloodbath on 10 November 1599. When the Swedish House of Knights was established, the family of Fleming of Louhisaari, noble since time immemorial, was registered there, under number 4 of untitled nobility. Sir Klas or Claes Larsson Fleming (Flemingvaesnsjigirhgarg) (1592‚Äì1644), was an admiral and the first Over-Governor of Stockholm (1634‚Äì1644) after the office was instituted by the Instrument of Government of 1634. His children were elevated to the friherre rank on 26 March 1651 by queen Christina of Sweden, with the title Baron of Liebelitz, due to service and accomplishments of the late father. This lineage continues to present day. Sir Eric Fleming (1616‚Äì79), provincial governor, president, chamber councillor, afterwards Marshal of Nobility (lantmarskalken) was created Baron of Lais on 12 May 1654 by queen Christina of Sweden. His male line became extinct 29 July 1786. Widow and children of Baron Claes Fleming af Liebelitz (1649‚Äì85), Marshal of Nobility, Lord High Treasurer of Sweden, president, a grandson of late sir Claes the admiral, were elevated on 10 December 1687 by king Charles XI of Sweden to the comital rank with the title Count to all male-line descendants. Their male line became extinct on 15 November 1729. Baron Claes Adolf Fleming (1771‚Äì1831), councillor of state, Lord High Constable of Sweden was created count on 11 May 1818, but he did not leave any surviving male descendants. Some members of the family still live in Sweden and the United States, but the line ended in the Finnish House of Nobility in mid-19th century.

Hitsuzendo refers specifically to a school of Japanese Zen calligraphy to which the rating system of modern calligraphy (well- proportioned and pleasing to the eye) is foreign. Instead, the calligraphy of Hitsuzendo must breathe with the vitality of eternal experience. Origins Yokoyama Tenkei (1885‚Äì1966), inspired by the teachings of Yamaoka Tesshu (1836‚Äì1888), founded the Hitsuzendo line of thought as a \\"practice to uncover one's original self through the brush.\\" This was then further developed by Omori Sogen Roshi as a way of Zen practice. Hitsuzendo is practised standing, using a large brush and ink, usually on newspaper roll. In this way, the whole body is used to guide the brush, in contrast to writing at a table. History Calligraphy was brought to Japan from China and Chinese masters such as Wang Xizhi ÁéãÁæ≤‰πã (Jp: Ou Gishi; 303-361) have had a profound influence, especially on the karay≈ç style which is still practiced today. The indigenous Japanese way≈ç tradition (ÂíåÊßòÊõ∏ÈÅì, way≈ç-shod≈ç) only appeared towards the end of the Heian era. However, the calligraphy of Zen scholars was often more concerned with spiritual qualities and individual expression and shunned technicalities which led to unique and distinctly personal styles.Nakata, Yujiro. The Art of Japanese Calligraphy, Weatherhill/Heibonsha, New York/Tojyo, 1973. Japanese calligraphy has three basic styles: Kaisho Ê•∑Êõ∏, Gy≈çsho Ë°åÊõ∏, and S≈çsho ËçâÊõ∏. Philosophical background True creativity is not the product of consciousness but rather the \\"phenomenon of life itself.\\" True creation must arise from mu-shin ÁÑ°ÂøÉ, the state of \\"no-mind,\\" in which thought, emotions, and expectations do not matter. Truly skilful Zen calligraphy is not the product of intense \\"practice;\\" rather, it is best achieved as the product of the \\"no-mind\\" state, a high level of spirituality, and a heart free of disturbances. To write Zen calligraphic characters that convey truly deep meaning, one must focus intensely and become one with the meaning of the characters they create. In order to do this, one must free one's mind and heart of disturbances and focus only on the meaning of the character. Becoming one with what you create, essentially, is the philosophy behind Zen Calligraphy and other Japanese arts.  See also  *Zenga *Bokuseki References * Terayama, Tanchu.

Semi-deciduous or semi-evergreen may also describe some trees, bushes or plants that normally only lose part of their foliage in autumn/winter or during the dry season, but might lose all their leaves in a manner similar to deciduous trees in an especially cold autumn/winter or severe dry season (drought).

It differs in its use from a mixed forest, a term usually applied to woods that contain both conifers and broad-leaved trees. Such forests receive less than 150 cm rainfall.
