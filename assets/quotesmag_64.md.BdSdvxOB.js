It is located west of the Darwin Settlement close to the location of the Battle of Goose Green and there is a replica of the cemetery at Berazategui in Buenos Aires Province Argentina.La r√©plica del cementerio de Darwin, ubicado en el cementerio de Berazategui, un muro en el que est√°n plasmados los nombres de los siete soldados berazateguenses que fallecieron History The Cemetery in 2008 When the war ended on June 14, 1982, most Argentine bodies were left in temporary graves close to where they fell. Britain offered to send them to Buenos Aires, but the ruling military junta said they were already in their homeland. In December 1982 the British government commissioned a firm of civilian undertakers under the command of British Army Colonel Geoffrey Cardozo, to consolidate all the temporary Argentine graves on the Islands to a single location. Assisted by the armed forces, they identified and documented each Argentine gravesite and brought the bodies to Port Darwin. As at the time this was the largest single Argentine gravesite, with the bodies of the 47 Argentine soldiers killed at the Battle of Goose Green and buried there soon after the battle.Suplemento de Historia Argentina Many of the bodies collected were without dog-tags, so best efforts were made to identify each soldier from personal effects found on the body. Single items were not considered conclusive, but collections were. All were given a Christian burial with full military honours. Each grave is marked by a white wooden cross with the name of the soldier on it, if known, or Soldado Argentino Solo Conocido Por Dios (\\"Argentine Soldier Known Only By God\\") if not. The cemetery is protected by a walled enclosure with a cenotaph including an image of Argentina's patron saint, the Virgen del Lujan. Surrounding the graves, the names of the 649 Argentine soldiers, sailors and airmen who lost their lives in the conflict are inscribed on glass plaques, with no indication of military rank or service, as requested by their families. Since the end of the conflict the bodies of three more Argentine pilots have been interred: * Capit√°n Jorge Osvaldo Garc√≠a successfully ejected from his Argentine Skyhawk after being shot down by a Sea Dart surface-to-air missile on May 25 but was not recovered from the water. His body was found in a dinghy on Golding Island in 1983. * Lieutenant Miguel Gim√©nez, a Pucar√° pilot, whose body was found in 1986. His burial was attended by his family, the first Argentine relatives to visit the Falklands since the end of the war. * Lieutenant Jorge Casco video, another Skyhawk pilot, who crashed in bad weather on South Jason Island and was buried on 7 March 2009. In the case of Lt. Casco, his family requested that his remains be buried on the Falklands even after they were returned to Argentina in July 2008 for DNA testing in order to confirm his identity. On 9 November 2002 Prince Andrew, himself a Falklands War Veteran, visited the Argentine cemetery and laid a wreath. During the visit the Prince said, \\"I lost friends and colleagues and I know what it must be like for the great many Argentines who have shared the same experience.\\" Since the UK-Argentine joint statement on 14 July 1999 Argentine families are responsible for the cemetery's upkeep and in 2007, Sebasti√°n Socodo, an Argentine married to a Falkland Islander, was employed to do the job of cemetery maintenance.  Location  Although the cemetery is referred to as the Cementerio de Darwin (which translates as the Darwin Cemetery) in Argentina, the location is several miles from the Darwin settlement. The area was known locally as Teal Creek after a house originally constructed nearby. There are no Argentines interred in the Darwin cemetery which is located in the settlement. Acts of vandalism  2012 vandalism  In July 2012 the glass casing protecting a figure of Argentina's patron saint, the Virgin of Luj√°n, at the head of the cemetery was smashed with what appeared to be an axe.Argentina will formally protest vandalism at the Darwin cemetery in Falklands Argentina presented a formal protest to the British government and informed the United Nations and the International Red Cross. Sebasti√°n Socodo, an Argentinian-Falklander responsible for the cemetery's upkeep, said families were notified and that it was not clear when it occurred or who the perpetrators were. Police in the Falklands held an investigation and the glass casing was repaired. 2017 vandalism A further act of vandalism was found in January 2017, when the glass was broken and the head of the Virgin of Luj√°n statue damaged. The Argentinian Foreign Ministry made a formal complaint to the British Government condemning the vandalism and calling for an enquiry. A Falkland Islands Government statement described the act as \\"distressing for the families (of the soldiers) and regretted by the people of the Falkland Islands\\" and an enquiry was begun by the Royal Falkland Islands Police. Former British Foreign Minister Sir Alan Duncan offered his apologies to the Argentine Government, welcoming the enquiry. Identification using DNA As part of a joint project between the UK, Falkland Islands, Argentine Government and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a forensic team exhumed, analyzed and documented the remains in each of the unidentified graves in the Argentine cemetery with this DNA compared to that of surviving family members. The DNA identification project was co-funded by the UK and Argentine Governments as a humanitarian initiative in line with international law. The 2 countries agree to try to identify the soldiers and divide the $1.5 million in related costs On 13 September 2016 a UK-Argentina Joint Communication both countries expressed their full support for a DNA identification process in respect of all unknown Argentine soldiers buried in the Falkland Islands. The ICRC's multinational 14-member forensic anthropology team began its efforts in June 2017 with samples analyzed in the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team's laboratory, and scientists in the United Kingdom and Spain confirmed the results of the DNA testing. By March 2018 the identities of 90 bodies had been confirmed and more than 200 relatives of these soldiers were able to visit the actual grave for the first time.Relatives of Argentine soldiers killed during the Falklands War visit the Argentine cemetery at Darwin On March 26, 2018, Argentina's Secretary for Human Rights, Claudio Avruj, accompanied the Argentine families, along with retired British Army colonel Geoffrey Cardozo, who was originally responsible for burying the Argentine dead immediately after the conflict. The visit included a religious ceremony jointly conducted by Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires, Bishop Eguia Segui, and the Right Reverend Abbott Hugh Allan from the United Kingdom. Since then, after obtaining more DNA samples from relatives some 115 bodies are now identified and a programme agreed with the UK and Falkland Islands Government aims to identify the remaining 10. ; Repatriation of remains Lieutenant :es: Luis Castagnari was killed on the night of May 29 and interred in the Darwin cemetery at the end of the conflict. On December 4, 2018 and at the request of his wife Mar√≠a, his remains were repatriated to the Argentine mainland for cremation and reburial in the Sagrado Coraz√≥n Parish, R√≠o Cuarto, C√≥rdoba.

It was one of the original buildings on the campus, and is modeled after the Universidad de Alcala de Henares in Alcal√° de Henares, Spain. The Admin building has three floors and a basement and includes twin bell towers, double wings, and a courtyard. Some of the offices housed in the building include the Chancellor's Office, President's Office and Board of Regents Office. Architecture Although the north facade draws inspiration from the Universidad de Alcala de Henares, the Administration Building is reminiscent of a typical mid-sixteenth-century, Plateresque period Spanish Alcaldia or city hall. The north facade of the building contains fine detailed ornamentation and is symbolic of the historical background of the region, and the philosophical aims and goals of the early Texas Technological College. The selection of much of the ornamentation of the building is credited to Texas Tech College's first president, Dr. Paul Horn, including two quotes on the north facade. The seals of Spain, France, Mexico, the Confederacy, the United States and Texas are also depicted on the north facade and symbolize the six nations that have had sovereignty over Texas at various times. Over the ten twin-arched windows of the second level of the north facade appear ten portrait medallions of significant figures in American and Texas history: Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Woodrow Wilson, James Hogg, Albert Sidney Johnston, Davy Crockett, Steven F. Austin, and Sam Houston. Victory Bells The Victory Bells consists of two bells, one large and one small, and are housed in the east bell tower. The bells were given to Texas Tech as a class gift in 1936 and were first rung at the class of 1936's graduation. Each graduate contributed $2 towards the cost of the bells. The Saddle Tramps and High Riders ring the Victory Bells after every varsity team's win. The tradition began on September 19, 1936, after the Red Raiders football team defeated Texas Wesleyan 26‚Äì7. The following Friday at a pep rally, head yell leader Arch Lamb told Texas Tech students, \\"if we gig the Horned Frogs the victory bells will be rung until 6 o'clock Sunday morning.\\" After the Red Raiders defeated the TCU Horned Frogs 7‚Äì0 the following day, the team's first victory over a Southwest Conference opponent, the bells rang, keeping Lubbock residents up all through the night. Thereafter, the bell ringing was limited to 30 minutes. Baird Memorial Carillon In 1973, Ruth Baird Larabee donated money to the university to buy and install a carillon in the west bell tower, in memory of her parents Charles and Ruth Baird. Originally consisting of 36 bells, the carillon was refurbished and extended in 2005, bringing the total range of the instrument to 3 octaves. Twelve of the original bells were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in England, the remaining twenty-four original bells were cast in France by the Paccard Foundry, and the newest bells were cast by the Meek & Watson Foundry in Ohio. The estimated value of the collection is $250,000. The carillon has been featured in the Carol of Lights every year since its inception in 1959. The carillon is played at 1:00 p.m. on July 4 in conjunction with the ceremonial ringing of the Liberty Bell, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The carillon also features Sunday evening concerts each summer. Double T Bench The Double T Bench, a bench in the shape of the Double T, is located in the courtyard of the Admin Building. The bench was a gift to the university by the class of 1931. It was an announced tradition that no freshmen were allowed to sit on the bench, a tradition that had faded by the 1950s.

Retrieved 2015-3-5. Only one was constructed. Design and development The Parnall Pike was submitted by Parnall to Air Ministry specification 1/24, calling for a three-seat reconnaissance aircraft that could operate from carrier decks or from the water, a Fairey IIID replacement. Two companies received orders for two aircraft each, Parnall and Shorts for their Sturgeon, although in the end only one Pike was built. The Pike used mixed construction, but its wings were wooden, fabric covered. They were without sweep and had equal span and constant chord, though the lower wing was noticeably narrower than the upper one. There were ailerons only on the upper wing. The wings together were unusual in having slight backward stagger and in being interconnected as a Warren girder with no bracing wires. Thus, seen from the front the left hand wing had pairs of struts of elongated and slightly distorted N form, one behind the other, attached to the two wing spars. The wings were fixed directly to the bottom and top of the fuselage, the upper wing narrowing significantly close to the root to assist visibility from the cockpits. Since the Pike was intended for ship-borne use, the wings folded alongside the fuselage.Flight 13 October 1927 p.713 The Pike's fuselage was a steel-tube structure, rectangular in cross-section and again fabric covered. It had a 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion water-cooled engine driving a two-bladed propeller. There was a small radiator mounted vertically in the nose immediately behind the propeller, with another inclined below. This arrangement allowed the upper surface of the forward fuselage to slope downwards steeply from the pilot's cockpit at the wing leading edge, giving him the good forward view essential for deck landings. The gunner's cockpit was aft, but ahead of the wing trailing edge. The fin and horn-balanced rudder together were large and rounded, the latter extending to the fuselage bottom between split, balanced elevators hinged to an upper fuselage mounted tailplane. A small V-braced tailskid was fixed under the tail. Armament was fairly standard. There was a fixed 0.303 (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted in the port side of the pilot's cockpit. The gunner had a Lewis gun of the same calibre, mounted on a Scarff ring. Up to four bombs could be carried on underwing racks. The specification required the Pike to fly with wheels or floats. As a landplane the Pike had a single-axle undercarriage, with a pair of oleo legs mounted at the wing root front spar and with rearward bracing. The axle carried arrester hooks, which engaged on landing with the longitudinal arrestor wires of those days. The floats were long, with marked chine and two steps, the second close to the tip where there was also a water rudder. They used the same oleo legs as the landplane, augmented by a pair of forward-reaching struts to the fuselage behind the lower radiator, and another pair aft. The Pike first flew on 14 March 1927, with Frank Courtney at the controls and having made a few earlier hops at Parnall's Yate factory airfield. From there it went to the MAEE at Felixstowe for trials on water. The Naval test pilots who flew it there were not enthusiastic about its handling, described as sluggish, nor about its cockpit which they found cold and draughty. Though the view over the nose was good, rearwards and downwards it was not. They also commented that the large separation between pilot's and gunner's cockpits made communication difficult. Plans to build a second Pike were abandoned when the Air Ministry rejected both it and its competitor, the Sturgeon as not meeting the specification requirements.

They are a subset of the embryophytes or land plants. The term phanerogams or phanerogamae is derived from the Greek , meaning \\"visible\\", in contrast to the cryptogamae from Greek = \\"hidden\\" together with the suffix , , \\"to marry\\". These terms distinguished those plants with hidden sexual organs (cryptogamae) from those with visible sexual organs (phanerogamae). Description The extant spermatophytes form five divisions, the first four of which are traditionally grouped as gymnosperms, plants that have unenclosed, \\"naked seeds\\": * Cycadophyta, the cycads, a subtropical and tropical group of plants, * Ginkgophyta, which includes a single living species of tree in the genus Ginkgo, * Pinophyta, the conifers, which are cone-bearing trees and shrubs, * and Gnetophyta, the gnetophytes, various woody plants in the relict genera Ephedra, Gnetum, and Welwitschia. The fifth extant division is the flowering plants, also known as angiosperms or magnoliophytes, the largest and most diverse group of spermatophytes. Angiosperms possess seeds enclosed in a fruit, unlike gymnosperms. In addition to the taxa listed above, the fossil record contains evidence of many extinct taxa of seed plants. The so-called \\"seed ferns\\" (Pteridospermae) were one of the earliest successful groups of land plants, and forests dominated by seed ferns were prevalent in the late Paleozoic. Glossopteris was the most prominent tree genus in the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana during the Permian period. By the Triassic period, seed ferns had declined in ecological importance, and representatives of modern gymnosperm groups were abundant and dominant through the end of the Cretaceous, when angiosperms radiated. Evolution A whole genome duplication event in the ancestor of seed plants occurred about .Jiao Y, Wickett NJ, Ayyampalayam S, Chanderbali AS, Landherr L, Ralph PE, Tomsho LP, Hu Y, Liang H, Soltis PS, Soltis DE, Clifton SW, Schlarbaum SE, Schuster SC, Ma H, Leebens-Mack J, Depamphilis CW (2011) Ancestral polyploidy in seed plants and angiosperms. Nature This gave rise to a series of evolutionary changes that resulted in the origin of seed plants. A middle Devonian (385-million-year-old) precursor to seed plants from Belgium has been identified predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the mutlilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous (wind) pollination. Runcaria sheds new light on the sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed. Runcaria has all of the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed. Relationships and nomenclature Seed-bearing plants are a subclade of the vascular plants (tracheophytes) and were traditionally divided into angiosperms, or flowering plants, and gymnosperms, which includes the gnetophytes, cycads, ginkgo, and conifers. Older morphological studies believed in a close relationship between the gnetophytes and the angiosperms, in particular based on vessel elements. However, molecular studies (and some more recent morphological and fossil papers) have generally shown a clade of gymnosperms, with the gnetophytes in or near the conifers. For example, one common proposed set of relationships is known as the gne-pine hypothesis and looks like: However, the relationships between these groups should not be considered settled. Other classifications group all the seed plants in a single division, with classes for the five groups: *Division Spermatophyta Cycadopsida, the cycads Ginkgoopsida, the ginkgo Pinopsida, the conifers, (\\"Coniferopsida\\") Gnetopsida, the gnetophytes Magnoliopsida, the flowering plants, or Angiospermopsida A more modern classification ranks these groups as separate divisions (sometimes under the Superdivision Spermatophyta): *Cycadophyta, the cycads *Ginkgophyta, the ginkgo *Pinophyta, the conifers *Gnetophyta, the gnetophytes *Magnoliophyta, the flowering plants An alternative phylogeny of spermatophytes based on the work by Nov√≠kov & Baraba≈°-Krasni 2015 with plant taxon authors from Anderson, Anderson & Cleal 2007 showing the relationship of extinct clades.

Gameplay Rush Rush Rally Racing has several game play modes. The goal of the single player grand prix mode is to qualify each race by finishing third, second, or in first place. If the player qualifies the race, he will proceed to the next level. If the player doesn't qualify, he can retry the level until his continues run out. The Grand Prix mode consists of 10 levels, after which the player is rewarded with an ending sequence. However, if the player finishes in first place in all levels, an 11th level is unlocked, and other ending sequences are shown, depending on whether the player finishes first in this level also. In the versus mode 2, 3, or 4 player can race against each other in a split screen mode. Nine levels are initially available for all multiplayer modes, in addition to the Grand Prix levels which can also be played. The item mode is the same as the versus mode, with the addition of various items that are scattered around the levels, such as oil slicks, super speed, invisibility, turn 180 degrees, etc. In the Get Ahead two player mode, the objective is to get so far ahead of your opponent that they disappear from the screen. Each time a player succeeds in doing so, they earn one token. The first player to earn 5 tokens is the winner. Development Senile Team started the project as an entry for a coding competition sponsored by Lik Sang in 2006. They chose to make a racing game because they believed it could be completed in a short time span, would stand out from the competition as majority of Dreamcast games released post discontinuation were Puzzle or Shooters. Retro over the head racers such as Combat Cars, Micro Machines, and Thrash Rally were cited as influences for the game. Lik-Sang was forced out of business on October 24, 2006 due to multiple lawsuits by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe prior to the coding competition and Senile Team had prepared for the contest entry a minimal feature set: one player, one type of car. Senile Team were proud with the work done on the game, however, it was not fit for publishing so they expanded upon the original idea and continued working. It took Senile Team three years to finish it. At Gamescom 2010, Senile Team and RedSpotGames announced the game for WiiWare, with 2 new modes (challenge and time attack), the game was playable at RedSpotGames' booth along with their other past and upcoming games. Reception Rush Rush Rally Racing didn't receive many reviews due to the title's release on the Sega Dreamcast, which at the time of the game's release had been out of production for eight years. BeefJack gave the game a score of 8.8 out of 10, citing the focus on difficult gameplay which required multiple playthroughs, and high level of presentation for not only an indie game but a Dreamcast game in general, as highlights: \\"a steep learning curve that works in favour of the title. As you master these levels and progress through the challenge is constantly with you, always keeping the gameplay fresh and intense...Because of this races always remain highly enjoyable as even after repeated plays things here never become stale.

It was originally located at the head of the Gulf of Adramyttium, at √ñren in the Plain of Thebe, 4 kilometres west of the modern town of Burhaniye, but later moved 13 kilometres northeast to its current location and became known as Edremit. History Classical period The site of Adramyttium was originally settled by Leleges, the indigenous inhabitants of the Aegean littoral, and people from the neighbouring region of Mysia.Karavul et al. (2010), pp. 876-877 The area was later settled by Lydians, Cimmerians, and Aeolian Greeks, who gave their name to the region of Aeolis. The area became part of the peraia (mainland territory) of the city-state of Mytilene in the 8th century BC,Constantakopoulou (2010), pp. 240-241 and the city of Adramyttium was founded in the 6th century BC. According to Aristotle, Adramyttium was founded by, and named after, Adramytos, the son of King Alyattes of Lydia.Hansen & Nielsen (2004), p. 1038 Prior to his ascension to the throne, Croesus, Alyattes' successor, was governor of a district centred on Adramyttium.Parke (1984), p. 218 Following the fall of the Kingdom of Lydia in 546 BC Adramyttium came under the rule of the Persian Empire and was administered as part of the satrapy (province) of Hellespontine Phrygia from the early 5th century BC onward. In 422 BC, Pharnaces, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, offered asylum to exiles from the island of Delos, who settled in the city. Thereafter Adramyttium was considered a Greek city.Magie (2015), p. 83 Arsaces, a general subordinate to Tissaphernes, the satrap of Lydia and Caria, massacred a number of the Delian exiles.Foster & Lateiner (2012), p. 274 The Delians returned to Delos in 421/420 BC when the Athenians permitted them to do so. Archaeological finds from Adramyttium at the Kuva-yi Milliye Museum, Balikesir Following the end of the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Adramyttium came again under the control of Mytilene. The Ten Thousand, a Greek mercenary force, travelled through Adramyttium during their march along the coast.Leaf (1923), p. 307 Mytilene retained control of Adramyttium until 386 BC, after which the city formed again part of the Persian Empire by the terms of the Peace of Antalcidas. During the Great Satraps' Revolt, Ariobarzanes, satrap of Hellespontine Phygia, joined the revolt against Artaxerxes II in 367 BC.Lendering (2005) Autophradates, satrap of Lydia, and Mausolus, satrap of Caria, besieged Ariobarzanes at Adramyttium in 366 BC.Almagor (2012) However, the siege of Adramyttium was abandoned following the arrival of Agesilaus II, King of Sparta, in 365 BC. Hellenistic period Following his victory at the Battle of the Granicus in 334 BC, Adramyttium came under the control of Alexander the Great.Coruhlu (2012), p. 63 After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire was divided among the Diadochi at the Partition of Babylon, and Leonnatus was appointed satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.Roberts (2007) At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Arrhidaeus succeeded Leonnatus as satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.Roisman (2012), p. 174 In 319 BC, Adramyttium and Hellespontine Phrygia were seized by Antigonus I Monophthalmus, satrap of Greater Phrygia.Tritle (2013), p. 130 Adramyttium and Hellespontine Phrygia remained under the control of Antigonus until the Fourth War of the Diadochi; the city was taken by force by Prepelaus, a general of Lysimachus, Basileus of Thrace, in 302 BC.Magie (2015), p. 89 Adramyttium and Lysimachus' other Anatolian territories were annexed to the Seleucid Empire after Lysimachus' defeat at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC.Will (1984), p. 113 An artificial port was constructed at Adramyttium in the early third century BC, which subsequently allowed the city to overshadow the neighbouring port of Cisthene.Leaf (1923), p. 267 Adramyttium came under the control of the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon during the rule of Eumenes I, a nominal vassal of the Seleucid Empire, in the mid- third century BC.Pic√≥n & Hemingway (2016), p. 34 The alliance between Attalus I, Eumenes's successor, and Rhodes during the Cretan War led Philip V, King of Macedonia, to invade the Kingdom of Pergamon and pillage the countryside surrounding Adramyttium in 201 BC. As an ally of Rome, Pergamon fought in the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War against the Seleucid Empire. In 190 BC, Antiochus III plundered the countryside surrounding Adramyttium, but the appearance of a Roman‚ÄìPergamene fleet prevented him from taking the city.Magie (2017), p. 757 In the second century BC, cistophori, the coinage of the Kingdom of Pergamon, were minted at Adramyttium.Magie (2017), p. 776 Attalus III, the last King of Pergamon, bestowed his kingdom to the Romans in his will,Coruhlu (2012), p. 64 and thus, in 133 BC, Adramyttium came under Roman control.Kiminas (2009), p. 81 The city became part of the province of Asia.Mills & Bullard (1990), p. 12 Roman period Manius Aquillius, governor of the province of Asia from 129 to 126 BC, rebuilt the road that connected Adramyttium and Smyrna.Magie (2015), p. 157 In the 1st century BC, a famous school of oratory was located in Adramyttium.Magie (2017), p. 905 Adramyttium was the centre of a conventus iuridicus,Magie (2017), p. 1060 and its jurisdiction included the Troad and the western half of Mysia.Magie (2017), p. 1062 Adramyttium was also the centre of a conventus civium Romanorum in the second or early first century BC.Magie (2015), pp. 162-163 During the First Mithridatic War, Diodorus, a strategos and supporter of Mithridates VI, King of Pontus, had the members of the city council killed and granted control of the city to Mithridates. Following the completion of the conquest of the province of Asia in 88 BC, Mithridates ordered the execution of all Roman settlers. At Adramyttium, the Romans were driven into the sea, where they were slaughtered.Magie (2015), pp. 216-217 At the conclusion of the war, the province of Asia returned to Roman control and Xenocles of Adramyttium, a prominent orator, was sent to Rome to defend the actions of the city during the war. Adramyttium, however, was deprived of its autonomy, and was henceforth obligated to pay regular taxes to Rome.Magie (2015), pp. 236-237 According to the Acts of the Apostles, whilst en route to Rome, St. Paul departed Caesarea Maritima on a ship from the city of Adramyttium which took him to Myra in Lycia. Adramyttium later also became the seat of a portorium. Adramyttium was damaged by an earthquake during the reign of Emperor Trajan (), who subsequently rebuilt the city.Karavul et al. (2010), p. 878 Upon the death of Emperor Theodosius I in 395, and subsequent division of the Roman Empire into eastern and western halves, Adramyttium became part of the Eastern Roman Empire. Medieval period The administrative reforms of the 7th century led Adramyttium to be administered as part of the Thracesian Theme.Nesbitt & Oikonomides (1996), p. 23 In early 715, soldiers of the theme of Opsikion mutinied and travelled to Adramyttium where they proclaimed Theodosius, a praktor (tax-collector),Kazhdan (1991a) as emperor.Venning & Harris (2006), p. 195 Theodosius did not wish to become emperor and fled to the mountains, but was found and forced to become emperor at sword-point.Norwich (1988), p. 349 Adramyttium came under the administration of the theme of Samos in the ninth century and became the seat of a tourmarches of that theme. A tourma of the hinterland of Adramyttium remained part of the Thracesian Theme, but was also based at Adramyttium. Adramyttium was sacked by Tzachas, a Turkish ruler, in and subsequently rebuilt and repopulated by Eumathios Philokales in 1109.Foss (1991) During this period, Adramyttium was used as a base to defend against Italian and Turkish attacks. Upon discovering that Malik Shah, Sultan of Rum, planned to invade in early 1112, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent an army to Adramyttium ahead of him as he travelled to the Chersonese peninsula.Venning & Harris (2006), p. 450 During the reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (), Adramyttion formed part of the new theme of Neokastra.Haldon & Davis (2002), p. 97 French crusaders passed through Adramyttium on their march south to Ephesus during the Second Crusade.Hendy (2008), pp. 107-108 After the ascension of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos in 1183, Andronikos Lapardas revolted against the emperor and travelled to Bithynia to join the rebels, but was seized at Adramyttium and imprisoned.Kazhdan & Wharton (1985), pp. 54-55 The megas doux Michael Stryphnos levied a fine on the Genoese merchant Cafforio,Venning & Harris (2006), p. 535 who subsequently raided the cities of the Aegean Sea and sacked Adramyttium in 1197. Following the Fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and the formation of the Latin Empire, Emperor Baldwin granted the land between Abydos on the Hellespont to Adramyttium to his brother Henry of Flanders, who went on to capture Adramyttium in the winter of 1204/1205.Van Tricht (2011), p. 106 The Byzantine magnate Theodore Mangaphas attempted to seize the city but was defeated by Henry of Flanders at the Battle of Adramyttium on 19 March 1205.Brand (1991a) Adramyttium was recovered by the Empire of Nicaea, a successor state of the Byzantine Empire, later that year. Nicaea maintained control of the city until 1211.Van Tricht (2011), p. 104 Henry of Flanders regained Adramyttium in October 1211 after his victory over the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris at the Battle of the Rhyndacus.Brand (1991b) Theodore I subsequently ceded Adramyttium to the Latin Empire in the Treaty of Nymphaeum.Venning & Harris (2006), p. 559 In 1224, Latin ruler in Anatolia collapsed and Adramyttium was recaptured by the Empire of Nicaea.Venning & Harris (2006), p. 569 The Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261 granted the Republic of Genoa trading privileges, such as marketplaces, at Adramyttium, among other Aegean cities.Kazhdan (1991b) In 1268, the Venetians were granted a concession in Adramyttium. In early 1284, a synod was held at Adramyttium by Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, accompanied by his aunt Theodora and his cousins Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene and Theodora Raoulaina, with the intention of reconciling with the \\"Arsenites\\", supporters of Arsenios Autoreianos, the deposed Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Arsenites who were poorly treated by Andronikos' father Michael VIII Palaiologos, who had deposed Arsenios, were declared martyrs; in exchange, the Arsenites temporarily recognized the appointment of Gregory II as Patriarch of Constantinople, as legitimate.Venning & Harris (2006), p. 622 During the synod, the two factions agreed to settle their dispute by setting fire to separate documents containing their arguments; the undamaged document was said to contain the truth, but both documents were destroyed in the fire.Kazhdan (1991c) Following victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Bapheus in July 1302, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty, Osman I, raided the countryside surrounding Adramyttium.Venning & Harris (2006), p. 636 The threat of Turkish attacks led the Genoese of Phocaea to seize the Venetian concession in Adramyttium in 1304. The city fell to the Karasid Turks before 1334. The Karasid beylik, including Adramyttium, was annexed by the Ottoman beylik in the mid-fourteenth century.Zachariadou (1991) Ecclesiastical history In 325 AD, the diocese of Adramyttium was made a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ephesus. Helladius, Bishop of Adramyttium, attended the Council of Ephesus in 431, and Aurelius attended the Synod of Constantinople in 448.P√©trid√®s (1912), coll. 596 Flavianus was present at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Julian is addressed in a work by Hypatius, Archbishop of Ephesus, in or . Theodore attended the Third Council of Constantinople in 680, and Basilius was present at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. Michael attended the Council of Constantinople of 869. Sergius was Bishop of Adramyttium at the beginning of the 11th century, and Bishop George was active later during the 11th century.Culerrier (1987), p. 153 Constantine was bishop sometime in the 11th‚Äì12th centuries. John was bishop in the second half of the 12th century, and Gregory was bishop in 1167. George was present at the Synod of Ephesus in 1230, and Athanasius was bishop later in the 13th century. The diocese of Adramyttium became defunct in the 15th century, but was united with the former Archdiocese of Pergamon to form the Archdiocese of Pergamon and Adramyttium on 19 February 1922. Following the Greco-Turkish population exchange in 1923, the see is titular only. During the second period of Latin occupation, between 1211 and 1224, a Latin bishop of Adramyttium was appointed and the diocese of Adramyttium was made a suffragan of the Latin archdiocese of Cyzicus.Van Tricht (2011), p. 325 Since the mid-15th century, it is a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church. Location Debate exists as to when Adramyttium moved to its current site at the modern city of Edremit. According to Wilhelm Tomaschek, Adramyttium moved to the site of modern Edremit under Trajan, however, it has been argued that there was no cause for this during Trajan's rule as piracy, the sole cause for such a move, was negligible.Leaf (1923), p. 323 Kiepert argued that this move took place in 1109, however, scholars note that it is not stated in contemporary sources that the city was rebuilt inland. It has also been argued that the relocation of Adramyttium took place after its destruction by Genoese pirates in 1197.

He played as a defender for Celtic and represented the Scotland national team in 15 official internationals between 1906 and 1920. McNair also represented the Scottish League XI 15 times. He then managed Dundee from 1925 until 1927. Stenhousemuir McNair began his career at Stenhousemuir. He played at inside right and was a regular goalscorer, helping the club win the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1901 and 1902. He also played in the Stenhousemuir team that reached the Scottish Cup semi-final in 1903, losing 4‚Äì1 to Rangers. Celtic In May 1904, McNair signed for Celtic. He initially played in a variety of positions, but when right-back Donnie McLeod left in 1908, McNair made that position his own. He was an integral part of the Celtic side spearheaded by Jimmy Quinn that won six successive league championships from 1904‚Äì05 to 1909‚Äì10. McNair had exceptional positional sense and ability to anticipate his opponents' moves. He was a precise tackler and had confidence in his ability to dribble the ball out of his own penalty area rather than rashly boot it forward. He was a calm and composed personality, and his demeanour earned him the nickname 'The Icicle'. Willie Maley, the Celtic manager, described McNair as \\"The coolest, most intelligent player I have ever seen.\\" 1908 Celtic team photo with the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, Scottish Cup and Glasgow Cup trophies; McNair is bottom row, far right In his 21 years at Celtic McNair played a total of 641 games for the club in major competitions, winning the league championship 12 times and the Scottish Cup six times. He played his last game on 18 April 1925, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Queen's Park. He was 41 years old and is the oldest player ever to play for Celtic. McNair's appearances, trophy and caps totals might have been even higher had it not been for the interruption of World War I when the League continued but the Cup and internationals were suspended, considering that his success at club level and selection for Scotland continued after the conflict. He received a benefit match in 1921, in which a combined Rangers/Celtic team played against a Scottish League team (the league also selected Celtic players John McFarlane and Tully Craig, who scored all their team's goals in a 3‚Äì1 win).Scottish League Select's Victory, 5 January 1921 (via The Celtic Wiki) Later years McNair became manager of Dundee in June 1925. His first two seasons saw Dundee finish mid-table and then fifth. However, after a poor start to season 1927‚Äì28, McNair left Dens Park in October 1927. He then left full-time participation in football to become a stockbroker, but still kept some involvement in the game by working as a referee supervisor.

It identifies which revenue source to pursue, what value to offer, how to price the value, and who pays for the value.Afuah, A. 2004. Business Models: A Strategic Management Approach. New York: McGraw-Hill/Irwin, pp. 67-69 It is a key component of a company's business model.Wagner, E. 2013. 5 Business Model Components Every Entrepreneur Needs [online]. Available from: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericwagner/2013/05/23/5-key-business-model- components/ [Accessed 20 October 2014] It primarily identifies what product or service will be created in order to generate revenues and the ways in which the product or service will be sold. Without a clear and well-defined revenue model, with a clear plan of how to generate revenues, new businesses will more likely struggle due to costs which they will not be able to sustain. By having a clear revenue model, a business can focus on a target audience, fund development plans for a product or service, establish marketing plans, begin a line of credit and raise capital.Grant, E. 2010. Defining a Revenue Model for Your Business: A solid revenue model is the foundation for a sustainable business [online]. Available from: http://www.business.com/business- planning/defining-a-revenue-model-for-your-business/ [Accessed 20 October 2014] Types The type of revenue model that is available to a firm depends, in large part, on the activities the firm performs, and how it charges for those. Various models by which to generate revenue include the following.  Production model  In the production model, the business that creates the product or service sells it to customers who value and thus pay for it. An example would be a company that produces paper, who then sells it to either the direct public or to other businesses, who pay for the paper, thus generating revenue for the paper company. = Manufacturing model = Manufacturing is the production of merchandise using labour, materials, and equipment, resulting in finished goods. Revenue is generated by selling the finished goods. They may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances or automobiles), or sold to wholesalers, who in turn sell them to retailers, who then sell them to end users and consumers. Manufactures may market directly to consumers, but generally do not, for the benefits of specialization. = Construction model = Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client, but may be done speculatively for sale on the real estate market.  Rental or leasing model  Renting is an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good, service or property owned by another. A gross lease is when the tenant pays a flat rental amount and the landlord pays for all property charges regularly incurred by the ownership. Things that can be rented or leased include land, buildings, vehicles, tools, equipment, furniture, etc.  Advertising model  The advertising model is often used by Media businesses which use their platforms where content is provided to the customer as an advertising space. Possible examples are newspapers and magazines which generate revenue through the various adverts encountered in their issues. Internet businesses which often provide services will also have advertising spaces on their platforms. Examples include Google and Taobao. Mobile applications also use this specific revenue model to generate revenues. By incorporating some ad space, many popular apps such as Twitter and Instagram have strengthened their mobile revenue potential after previously having no real revenue stream.Danova, T. 2014. For Mobile-Social Apps, Advertising Is Winning As The Money-Making Revenue Model [online]. United States: Business Insider Inc.. Available from: http://www.businessinsider.com/advertising-is-the-most-lucrative-revenue- model-for-growing-mobile-social-apps-2014-1 [Accessed 20 October 2014]  Sponsored ranking model  The sponsored ranking model is a variant of the Advertising model. The sponsored ranking model is mainly used by search engine platforms like Google and specialized products- and IT-services- platforms where users are offered free search functionality in return for sponsored results in front of other search results. The sponsor is often paying per click, per view or as a Subscription model  Commission model  The commission model is similar to the markup model as it is used when a business charges a fee for a transaction that it mediates between two parties. Brokerage companies or auction companies often use it as they provide a service as intermediaries and generate revenue through commissions on the sales of either stock or products.  E-commerce model  This revenue model is the implementation of any of the other revenue models online  Fee-for- service model  In the fee-for-service model, unlike in the subscription model, the business only charges customers for the amount of service or product they use. Many phone companies provide pay-as-you-go services whereby the customer only pays for the number of minutes he actually uses.  Licensing model  With the licensing model, the business that owns a particular content retains copyright while selling licenses to third parties. Software publishers sell licenses to use their programs rather than straight- out sell copies of the program. Media companies also obtain their revenues in this manner, as do patent holders of particular technologies.Holcombe, C. 2012. Revenue Streams [online]. Available from: http://www.ecommerce- digest.com/revenue-streams.html [Accessed 20 October 2014] = Software licensing model = Rather than selling units of software, software publishers generally sell the right to use their software through a limited license which defines what the purchaser can and cannot do with it.  Shareware model  In the shareware model, users are encouraged to make and share copies of a software product, which helps distribute it. Payment may be left entirely up to the goodwill of the customer (donationware), or be optional with an occasional reminder (nagware), or the software may be designed to stop working after a trial period unless the user pays a license fee (trialware or demoware), or be crippled so that key features don't work. Or it may be a free feature-limited \\"lite\\" version (freemium), with a more advanced version available for a fee.  Donationware  Donationware is a licensing model that supplies fully operational unrestricted software to the user and requests an optional donation be paid to the programmer or a third-party beneficiary (usually a non-profit). The amount of the donation may also be stipulated by the author, or it may be left to the discretion of the user, based on individual perceptions of the software's value. Since donationware comes fully operational (i.e. not crippleware) with payment optional, it is a type of freeware.  Nagware  Nagware is a type of shareware that persistently reminds (nags) the user to register it by paying a fee. It usually does this by popping up a message when the user starts the program, or intermittently while the user is using the application. These messages can appear as windows obscuring part of the screen, or as message boxes that can quickly be closed. Some nagware keeps the message up for a certain time period, forcing the user to wait to continue to use the program.  Crippleware model  In software, crippleware means that \\"vital features of the program such as printing or the ability to save files are disabled until the user purchases a registration key\\". This allows users to take a close look at the features of a program without being able to use it to generate output.  Freemium models  Freemium works by offering a product or service free of charge (typically digital offerings such as software, content, games, web services or other) while charging a premium for advanced features, functionality, or related products and services. For example, a fully functional feature-limited (\\"lite\\") version may be given away for free, with advanced features disabled until a license fee is paid. The word \\"freemium\\" is a portmanteau combining the two aspects of the business model: \\"free\\" and \\"premium\\". It has become a highly popular model, with notable success.  Markup model  In the markup model, unlike with previous models, the business buys a product or service and increases its price before reselling it to customers. This model characterises wholesalers and retailers, who buy products from manufacturers, mark up their prices, and resell them to end customers. = Wholesale = Wholesaling, jobbing, or distributing is the sale of goods or merchandise to retailers; to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users; or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services. In general, it is the sale of goods to anyone other than the end-consumer. Wholesaling can be implemented online via electronic transactions. = Retail = Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Demand is identified and then satisfied through a supply chain. Attempts are made to increase demand through advertising.  Brick and mortar retail  Conventional retail or brick and mortar retail is selling products from a physical sales outlet or store.  Mail order  The mail order revenue model and distribution method entails sending goods by mail delivery. The buyer places an order for the desired products with the merchant through some remote method such as by telephone call or web site. Then, the products are delivered to the customer, typically to a home address, but occasionally the orders are delivered to a nearby retail location for the customer to pick up. Some merchants also allow the goods to be shipped directly to a third party consumer, which is an effective way for someone to buy a gift for an out-of-town recipient.  E-tail  E-tail is on-line retail. Retail is the process of selling consumer goods and/or services directly to end-consumers to earn a profit. Demand is created through promotion, and by satisfying consumers' wants and needs effectively (which generates word-of-mouth-advertising). In the 21st century, an increasing amount of retailing is e-tailing, done online using electronic payment and delivery via a courier or postal mail. Via e-tail, the customer can shop and order through the internet and the merchandise is dropped at the customer's doorstep. This format is ideal for customers who do not want to travel to retail stores and are interested in home shopping. The online retailer may handle the merchandize directly, or use the drop shipping technique in which they accept the payment for the product but the customer receives the product directly from the manufacturer or a wholesaler.  Subscription model  In the subscription model, the business provides a product or service to a customer who in return pays a pre-determined fee at contracted periods of time to the business. The customer will be required to pay the fee until the contract with the business is terminated or expires, even if he is not using the product or service but is still adhering to the contract. Possible examples are flat-rate cellular services, magazines and newspapers. Revenue streams A revenue stream is an amount of money that a business gets from a particular source.Collins. 2014. Definition of Revenue Stream [online]. Available from: http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/revenue- stream?showCookiePolicy=true [Accessed 21 October 2014] A revenue model describes how a business generates revenue streams from its products and services.Laniado, E. 2013. Revenue model types: the quick guide [online]. BMN! Available from: http://www.bmnow.com/revenue-models-quick-guide/ [Accessed 22 October 2014] They are resultantly a key aspect of the revenue model. They are generated through the use of the revenue model components listed in the section above. Businesses continually seek for new ways of generating revenues, thus new revenue streams. Finding a new revenue stream has gradually taken on a distinct and specialized meaning in certain contexts to mean a new, novel, undiscovered, potentially lucrative, innovative, and creative means of generating income or exploiting a potential. This approach in particular can especially be applied to new technology and internet businesses which find extremely innovative ways of generating revenues, often ways which seemed not to be possible.Revenue Streams [online]. Available from: http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/revenue-streams.html [Accessed 22 October 2014] As a result, technology-based businesses are constantly updating their revenue models in order to remain competitive. Advertising can be seen as a component of the revenue model, however, when the business is advertising its own products, this would result as a cost for the business which is the exact opposite of revenue. On the other hand, advertising can lead to an increase in sales thus revenue over a period of time. For the majority of businesses which will add value to a product or service that will be purchased by a customer, advertising is often a component of their business plan. Expenditure for this particular component is forecasted as it can generate greater revenues over periods of time.Barrow, C., Barrow, P., Brown, R, 2008. The Business Plan Workbook: The Definitive Guide to Researching, Writing up and Presenting a Winning Plan. 6th ed. London: Kogan Page Limited, pp. 150-155 Component of a business model A revenue model is part of a business model. A business model shows the framework for an entire business and allows investors and bankers, as well as the entrepreneur, to have a quick way of evaluating that business. Business models can be viewed in many different ways, but they are generally composed of the following six elements:Debelak, D. 2006. Business Models Made Easy, Irvine US: Entrepreneur Press, pp. 4‚Äì9 # Offer significant value to customers # Fund the business # Acquire high value customers # Deliver products or services with high margins # Provide for customer satisfaction # Maintain market position The revenue model is a key component of the business model as it is an essential factor for delivering products or services with high margins and funding the business. Less than 50% of the investment required to set up a business will be used in revenue-producing areas. It can not resultantly be viewed as being identical to the business model as it does not influence all the six elements but more should be viewed as an inner component of it. Having a well-structured business model is necessary for the success of any business adding value to a product or service for customers. This will consequently include having a clear and tailored revenue model which will ensure its financial health. It provides the owners of the business with a necessary understanding of cash flows as well as how it will generate revenue and maximize profitability.Ehrenberg, D. 2013. 7 Steps to Developing Your Revenue Model [online]. Available from: https://www.affinitylive.com/resources/blog/7-steps-to-developing-your- revenue-model/ [Accessed 23 October 2014] In addition to the business model, financial targets have to be forecasted when creating an initial business plan whereby expected revenues and profits will have to be presentedBlackwell, E. 1998.

The technique is most effective when the universe of keys is reasonably small, such that allocating an array with one position for every possible key is affordable. Its effectiveness comes from the fact that an arbitrary position in an array can be examined in constant time. Applicable arrays There are many practical examples of data whose valid values are restricted within a small range. A trivial hash function is a suitable choice when such data needs to act as a lookup key.

He is best known for being the primary disciple of Nosson Tzvi Finkel, the Alter of Slabodka\\",According to Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky, quoted by Rabbi Nathan Kamenetsky in Making of a Godol and for his book of mussar (ethics) lectures called Toras Avraham.Published posthumously by his son Yitzchak Grodzinsky in conjunction with Kollel Toras Avraham Early life Grodzinski was born in 1883 in Warsaw to parents of Lithuanian Jewish descent. His grandfather, Zev Grodzinski, emigrated from Lithuania to Warsaw, and his father, Yitzchak (Itcheh) was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Jewish community. Itcheh established and supported a yeshiva in Warsaw, regarding which the Chofetz Chaim commented \\"Reb Itcheh saved Jewish education in Warsaw\\".heard on a tape from Berel Wein of Yeshiva Shaarei Torah circa 1988 His home was dedicated solely to the dissemination of Torah and chesed (lovingkindness); tens of poor people partook in meals on a daily basis. Grodzinski once quipped, \\"From a young age, I was so busy assisting and catering to all the guests and helping my father in all his chesed activities, I did not have a childhood\\". Itcheh was very close to the great Torah leaders of his time, many of whom frequented his home when visiting Warsaw. The Beis Halevi asked Itcheh to accompany him to Brisk to accept the helm of the rabbinate there. Slabodka and the Alter After short stints studying Torah in Yeshivas Radin and ≈Åom≈ºa, in 1899 Grodzinski enrolled in the Slabodka yeshiva in Lithuania, which was under the leadership of Nosson Tzvi Finkel. Under the auspices of Finkel, known as the 'Alter of Slabodka', Grodzinski began years of toil in Torah and self-perfection. Although few details from those years are known, the little that is known gives a picture of his character and the methods he used to further his development. He spent two years perfecting the attribute of \\"greeting every individual with a pleasant facial countenance\\". People would later attest to the extent of which he inculcated this precept into his character; even in the most horrific times in the Kovno Ghetto during the Holocaust, his pleasant facial expression masked his internal grief. Grodzinski's work on character development never interfered with his intense Talmudic study. During his tenure in Slabodka, Grodzinski forged a deep and close relationship with the Alter. He immersed himself in his mentor's teachings, mastering them all and internalizing them. The Alter, in turn, pointed to him as \\"my portion in all my efforts.\\" His relationship with the Alter was fundamental to his own personal growth, and years later, when he accepted the mantle of leadership in the Slabodka yeshiva, the presence of the Alter never left his consciousness. Death In 1944, Grodzinski was burned alive when the Kovna hospital he was confined to was set ablaze. Of his eight children, four perished in the Holocaust and four survived.

Written in 1939 and substantially revised in 1959, it is by far Hartmann's best known work, especially noted for its lyrical final movement. The title is Italian. Unlike many of his works, which the composer did not consider completed before they had been substantially reworked as part of an ongoing process after the end of World War II, he completed the Concerto funebre in a relatively short timespan, principally in autumn of 1939. Originally entitled Musik der Trauer (Music of Mourning), he retitled it after only minor revisions in 1959.Rickards, Guy (1995) Hindemith, Hartmann and Henze, Phaidon It is cast in four movements: # Introduktion. Largo # Adagio # Allegro di molto # Choral. Langsamer Marsch The final chorale is based on a popular Russian song Unsterbliche Opfer (Immortal Victims) which Hartmann almost certainly learned from his mentor, the conductor Hermann Scherchen, who had heard it while interned in Russia during World War I. Scherchen had published his own translation and arrangement of it in Berlin, for use by the choirs he was then conducting. In Russian it appears to have originated as a song of mourning for the victims of the 1905 Revolution, which explains its appearance in Shostakovich's 11th Symphony, op. 103 (1957), whose subject is the same traumatic episode. It is also likely that Hartmann knew a well-known 78 rpm recording of Unsterbliche Opfer made by the violinist Eduard S√µrmus. available on CD Br√ºder, zur Sonne, zur Freiheit - Arbeitermusik in der Weimarer Republik in Originalaufnahmen. Dortmund, Edition Pl√§ne nr. 88775 Hartmann said in a letter to Scherchen that the structure of Concerto funebre was designed to reflect: It was premiered in the Grosser Saal of the Tonhalle at St. Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 February 1940 by the St. Gallen Chamber Orchestra under the direction of Ernst Klug; the soloist was the violinist Karl Neracher.Liner notes to Hyperion CDA67547. Despite the difficulties of wartime travel, the composer obtained permission to travel from Munich to attend. Hartmann's revision was first performed at Braunschweig on 12 November 1959, conducted by Heinz Zeebe. The soloist at that performance was Wolfgang Schneiderhan, one of the work's strongest advocates. A later performance survives on record (Orfeo label). The first recording was made by the Swiss violinist Ulrich Lehmann with the Zurich Chamber Orchestra conducted by Edmond de Stoutz (Amadeo label). Other soloists who have taken the work into their repertoire and made recordings include Andr√© Gertler, Michael Erxleben, Isabelle Faust, Ida Haendel, Alina Ibragimova, Suyoen Kim, Susanne Lautenbacher, Mauro Loguercio, Gordan Nikoliƒá, Theo Olof, Nilla Pierrou, Maffeo Scarpis, Benjamin Schmid, Gil Shaham, Vladimir Spivakov, Thomas Zehetmair and Patricia Kopatchinskaja.

He has created a number of mural paintings and ceramic tile murals in public and private spaces throughout France, Spain, and Belgium. He is also responsible for creating sculptures out of sheets of aluminum and stainless steel in public and private spaces in France and Canada, such as ‚ÄúLes Otimistes‚Äù in Foug√®res, France. Rabinowitz began practicing art as a profession in the 1960s and rose to prominence through the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Biography Le G√©ant Bleu, 1999 Rabinowitz was born in March 1939 in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, a Jewish community in what would later become Israel. He lost his parents at a very early age and spent his childhood years in Poland and Israel. Yehiel was a versatile pupil; able in languages, mathematics, and engineering, yet his principal interest was drawing. He obtained a military rank that allowed him to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Tel Aviv, where he stayed in 1958 and 1959. He decided to celebrate his twentieth birthday in Paris, the capital of art at the time. Rabinowitz was admitted to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He stayed there for five years (1960‚Äì1965) and refused the customary specialization, enrolling in as many ateliers (drawing, litho, painting, sculpturing) as possible. Apart from creating numerous individual drawings, paintings, and sculptures, Rabinowitz has won a number of important art contests, thus realizing many large mural paintings and a number of sculptures. Early works In 1965, almost immediately after leaving Beaux Arts, Rabinowitz got a first solo exhibition at Gallery Abel Rambert in Paris. This exposition was followed by several others in France, Israel, and Norway. At that time Rabinowitz envisioned making paintings in the street, basically accessible for everybody--quite a revolutionary thought at the time. In 1968, during the anarchic months in Paris, Rabinowitz became a member of the atelier populaire, making posters to support the student movement. Thereafter Rabinowitz was a founding member of atelier critique, an ever-changing group of artists with a loose, non-hierarchical organization. The group experimented with new ways of collective creating, for example by creating wigs, street-games, balloons, and even floating isles. The atelier ceased to exist in 1970. Mural paintings Floor Mosaic, 1992 In 1971 his first mural painting was realized for the photographer Bernard Goustard. It was followed by many others, mainly in Paris, though few of these survive. By 1975, Rabinowitz's mural paintings had raised the attention of a number of architects, one of whom suggested to realize one in the newly built Renault site in Grand-Couronne. This new idea was endorsed by then company president Pierre Dreyfus and subsequently led to a number of mural paintings and murals of ceramic tiles in private and public spaces throughout France, Spain, and Belgium. Rabinowitz realized more than 100 mural paintings until 1999. Some of these are very large covering several thousand square meters. Several mural paintings were supplemented by floors of marble mosaic. Sculptures Les Otimistes, Foug√®res, France, 2007 In the late 1980s, Rabinowitz started experimenting with the creation of sculptures out of sheets of aluminium and stainless steel. During the 1990s he realized a number of important projects in public and private spaces. This part of his artistic accomplishment continues till today, with the highlight to date being \\"Les Otimistes\\", a fa√ßade sculpture consisting of 15 high columns with 86 \\"flying persons\\", realized in Foug√®res, France (2005‚Äì2007).

Lifting / relaxing prohibition of alcohol is unconstitutional which is reversing the earlier implemented policy as per Article 37 as long as alcohol prohibition is part of DPSP. National Prohibition was advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, as well as by many Indian women. Prohibition, in the states of India that have implemented the policy, has led to lower rates of drinking among men, as well as a decreased incidence of violence against women.  History  The temperance movement in India often led to the prohibition of alcohol in various states, as with Manipur. In British India, many Indian temperance activists agitated for prohibition in the country. Mahatma Gandhi was a champion of the temperance movement and viewed foreign rule as an obstacle to national prohibition. When India gained independence in 1947, \\"prohibition was included in the Directive Principles of the Constitution of India and the government of several states such as Gujarat introduced it.\\"  Social and economic effects  Prohibition, in the states of India that have implemented the policy, has led to lower rates of drinking among men, as well as a decreased incidence of violence against women. States practicing prohibition Bihar On 26 November 2015, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced that alcohol would be banned in the state from 1 April 2016. Kumar officially declared the total ban on 5 April 2016, and said in a press conference, \\"All type of liquor will be banned in the state from today. Sale [and consumption] of any type of alcohol in hotels, bars, clubs and any other place will be illegal from today onwards.\\" Violating the law carries a penalty of 5 years to 10 years imprisonment. On 30 September 2016 Patna High Court ruled that the ban is \\"illegal, impractical and unconstitutional\\". Although even before the High Court order came, the Bihar government had announced that it would enforce a new stringent law from 2 October 2016, only to stay adamant on it after the order. The government had drafted a new law to keep from withdrawing the ban. As per the new liquor law, those found indulging in unlawful import, export, transport, manufacture, possession, sale, intoxicant or liquor could attract a minimum 10 years of jail term which may extend to imprisonment for life besides a minimum fine of Rs 1 lakh which may extend to Rs 10 lakh, says a report by Press Trust of India. On 3 October 2016, the Bihar government approached Supreme Court of India challenging the High Court order. The Supreme Court Bench headed by Chief Justice T. S. Thakur agreed to give an urgent hearing on the matter and on 7 October 2016, much to the relief of the government, the bench stayed the high court order. \\"Ban on liquor and fundamental rights do not go together,\\" the SC bench said. The bench has directed the hearing of the matter after 10 weeks. On 25 October 2016, the Bihar Government decided to renew liquor licences of canteens in cantonment areas, military and air force stations for 2016‚Äì2017 in the \\"interest of soldiers\\", The Telegraph reported. On 21 January 2017, more than 3 crore (30 million) people of Bihar joined hands to form a historic human chain along 12,760 km of roads to support ban on alcohol by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. This unprecedented and massive human chain was supported by people from all walks of life and political parties. The Government of Bihar introduced a new version of Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act on 2 October 2016, days after the Patna High Court quashed the previous bill, deeming it as \\"illegal\\". The act brought in stricter measures, with all Sections in the act being non- bailable and the police being allowed to assume that manufacturing of alcohol was ongoing if utensils containing a mix of jaggery or grapes are found. Under the law, only special courts constituted under Bihar Special Courts Act can try the cases. It also empowered authorities to confiscate properties upon whose premises liquor is either consumed or stored. The new policy was challenged in Patna High Court a day later. Supreme Court of India meanwhile stayed Patna High Court's order on quashing Bihar's ban on alcohol. It stayed proceedings of all challenges to Bihar's new law in the Patna High Court on 2 January 2017, stating that it will itself hear all cases related to the new ban. However, the Bihar government is going to introduce an amendment to the liquor law in the upcoming monsoon session of Bihar assembly beginning 20 July. According to the new amendment, the first time offenders will not mandatorily face jail term if they pay a fine of Rs. 50,000. = Socio- economic effects in Bihar = Within a year of prohibition, the number of murders and gang robberies decreased by 20%. The number of riots fell by 13% and traffic accidents were reduced by 10%. For the economy, spending per household rose: increase in sales of milk by 10%, cheese by 200%, two-wheeled vehicles by 30%, and electrical appliances by 50%. In villages, brick houses are gradually taking the place of more rudimentary cottages since state Prohibition came into effect. At the same time, substance abuse has increased significantly due to liquor being hard to access. Gujarat Bombay State had prohibition between 1948 and 1950, and again from 1958. Gujarat has a sumptuary law in force that proscribes the manufacture, storage, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The legislation has been in force since 1 May 1960 when Bombay State was bifurcated into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 is still in force in Gujarat state, however there is licensing regime in Maharashtra with granting licenses to vendors and traders. Gujarat is the only Indian state with a death penalty for the manufacture and sale of homemade liquor that results in fatalities. The legislation is titled the Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat Amendment) Act, 2009. The legislation was prompted by numerous deaths resulting from the consumption of methyl alcohol. Predictably, smuggling and illicit sale of alcohol are very common. \\"Folder\\" is a slang term of unknown origin, used in Gujarat to refer to a bootlegger who delivers alcohol on-demand. =Permits= Foreigners and visitors from other parts of India can apply online for a permit. There are 35 stores across the state including nine in Ahmedabad that sell liquor on production of a physical copy of the permit. Once the permit expires, users are to hand-over the unconsumed liquor to the district collector. =Public Interest Litigation= Five petitions, including Public Interest Litigation (PIL), have been filed before the Gujarat High Court challenging the prohibition law in the state. Most petitioners have raised concern that prohibition law violates Right to Privacy and are seeking relaxation on consumption in privacy. Mizoram The Mizoram Liquor Total Prohibition Act, 1995 banned sale and consumption of alcohol effective from 20 February 1997. In 2007, the MLTP Act was amended to allow wine to be made from guavas and grapes, but with restrictions on the alcohol content and the volume possessed. It is illegal to transport these products out of the state. Mizoram repealed prohibition on 10 July 2014, a period of 17 years after it had been imposed. On that date, the state Legislative Assembly passed the Mizoram Liquor (Prohibition and Control) Act, 2014 (MLPC Act), replacing the MLTP Act. The Presbyterian Church had organised mass prayers in all member churches across the state twice that year opposing the repeal of prohibition. The Mizoram Liquor (Prohibition and Control) Act, 2014 was repealed on 20 March 2019 with the Mizoram Liquor Prohibition Act, 2019, it was a legislation promised by the Mizo National Front. Rules are yet to be notified for the ban in the state. Nagaland The Nagaland Liquor Total Prohibition Act, 1989 (NLTP Act) banned the sale and consumption of alcohol in 1989. Enforcement of the ban is lax and Indian Made Foreign Liquor is readily available. Authorities generally turn a blind eye towards illegal sales. Reports have stated that some police officials themselves engage in bootlegging. The Congress party has termed prohibition a \\"total failure\\" and has pleaded for it to be revoked. The excise department had earned around prior to prohibition. It earned about annually in NLTP Act related fines as of June 2014. The Morung Express estimated that were about 500 illegal liquor bars in Dimapur, the largest city in the state, as of August 2014. Alcohol is also smuggled in from neighbouring Assam. Lakshadweep Lakshadweep is the only union territory that bans the sale and consumption of alcohol. Consumption is permitted only on the island of Bangaram. Bangaram is an uninhabited island, but the Bangaram Island Resort has a bar. Dry days Dry Days are specific days when the sale of alcohol is prohibited. Dry Days are fixed by the respective state government. Most Indian states observe dry days on major religious festivals/occasions depending on the popularity of the festival in that region. National holidays such as Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti (2 October) are usually dry days throughout India. Dry days also depend on the establishment selling alcohol. For example, generally 5-star hotels do not have to observe all the dry days that liquor stores and small bars may have to. Dry days are also observed on and around voting days. National dry days also occur during Election Commission of India- ordained voting and result days. States no longer practicing prohibition Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram and Tamil Nadu have previously enforced, but later repealed prohibition. Andhra Pradesh The total prohibition was introduced in Madras State (which included Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema) when C. Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister in 1952. The ban was re-introduced by N. T. Rama Rao in 1994. N. Chandrababu Naidu repealed the prohibition in 1997, claiming that it was \\"not successful or feasible because of the leakages within the state and from across the borders\\". Haryana Bansi Lal led Haryana Vikas Party lift the prohibition on 1 April 1998. The total prohibition was in force in the state from July 1996. Kerala Kerala currently allows alcohol to be served in most hotels, bars and airports. A ban imposed by the United Democratic Front government in 2014 was reversed by the Left Democratic Front government in 2017 when they came to power citing heavy losses in state revenue and sharp decrease in tourism industry. On 24 August 2014, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy announced that Kerala would implement prohibition in a phased manner. The decision was a result of factional conflict within the UDF, led by KPCC President V. M. Sudheeran. The decision was supported by the Catholic Church, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the Kerala Congress. Liquor bars in Kerala are required to renew their licenses every year. The state government did not license any bars on 31 March 2014, resulting in the closure of 418 bars. The state government also declared its intention not to renew the licenses of the remaining 313 bars in the state. The state owned Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) had 338 shops, and Bevco would shut down 10% of them every year. Consumerfed, which has 46 shops, would also be closed. However, sale of alcohol would continue to be permitted in 5-star hotels, and there were fourteen 5-star hotels in the state as of August 2014. Toddy would also continue to be legally sold, and toddy shops would be permitted to operate as before. The state incurred heavy losses due to its tourism-based economy being severely affected by prohibition. However, after the 2016 Elections where the UDF was defeated by the LDF, the newly elected Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, reversed the policy of prohibition. The Chief Minister stated that the state's policy would move from prohibition to regulation. In June 2017 the ban was revoked, allowing three stars hotels and above to openly serve alcohol to its customers. The restrictions on bars were also eased with bars being allowed to remain open till 2300 instead of previous 2200 with new bars being allowed to apply for license. Airport lounges were also allowed to start serving alcohol again. Manipur Prohibition in force in districts shown in red, repealed in green. Prohibition is enforced in the Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts of Manipur. Prohibition was enforced statewide by the Raj Kumar Ranbir Singh government with effect from 1 April 1991. Local brews called and are available in most areas, and authorities usually ignore their sale and consumption. In 2002, the Okram Ibobi Singh government lifted prohibition in the five hill districts of Manipur. The state Legislative Assemble passed the Manipur Liquor Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 2002 on 31 July 2002 lifting prohibition in the districts of Chandel, Churachandpur, Senapati, Tamenglong and Ukhrul. In 2015, Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh stated in the Manipur state assembly that the state government was looking at the option of lifting prohibition in the state, but liquor ban still continues in the state.  Tamil Nadu  The total prohibition was introduced in Madras State when C. Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister in 1952. In 1971, the DMK government led by M. Karunanidhi suspended it on 30 August 1971 and allowed the sale of arrack and toddy. In 1983, after previous serial introduction of prohibition and its revocation the state owned liquor distribution company TASMAC was established by the then Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran. The TASMAC has a monopoly over wholesale and retail vending of alcoholic beverages. Since then, various prohibitions were installed in form of reduction of TASMAC shops, however, the alcohol selling is still legal.

Girgenti House View of the farm, tower and lodges from near Torranyard Captain John Cheape, the builder of Girgenti House, belonged to the Fife family represented by George C. Cheape, Esq., of Strathtyrum, and was the seventh son of James Cheape, Esq., of Sauchie, in Clackmannanshire. He was in the Scots Fusilier Guards and had served in the Napoleonic Wars.Millar, p. 86. Bonnyton (not Muirhead as sometimes stated) was renamed Girgenti by the well-travelled Captain Cheape, perhaps in honour of a visit to the ancient Greek ruins of Agrigentum (the name of the town has become Girgenti in modern Sicilian). In 1827 he paid Thomas Reid ¬£1350Love (2005), p. 39. for the property, totalling 50 Scotch acres, and at a cost of ¬£6000 he demolished the old Bonnyton farm steading and built a rather eccentric mansion house and offices and planted extensive plantations and shrubberies on what had been a wild moss-land. It is not known what brought him to the area or why he chose such a comparatively desolate site. Moorhead is the original name given in the Lainshaw Register of Sasines for Girgenti.Lainshaw, Register of Sasines, Page 159 A clue to his acquisition of these moss lands lies in the fact that The Royal Horticultural and Agricultural Society of Scotland awarded Cheape with an Honorary Silver Medal in 1833 for his publication entitled \\"Cultivation of Land by Manual Labour.\\"Cheape, p.50 Cheape had been an ensign in the 44th Regiment of Foot, then joined the 98th Regiment and next moving as a captain to the Royal Glasgow Regiment of Foot, 1800 saw him in the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards and in 1803 he retired. Cheape lived at Girgenti for the last twenty years of his life (1829‚Äì1850) after leaving the army. The house had a pillared portico and was basically single-storeyed in appearance, with bays, a capped tower and dormer windows on two different levels; it had a large summer house. A conservatory was present and a sunken eight roomed storey for servants.McLeish, p.51 The OS maps show associated buildings‚Äîpresumably the mains or home farm and a coach house, stables, and so forth.

The tower Cheape died unmarried at Girgenti on 10 February 1850, aged 76, leaving James McAlister of Kennox to administer the lands of Girgenti. The estate was sold to benefit a number of infirmaries across Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee). He was buried in the Laigh Kirk, Stewarton. Cheape's only sister, Marianne, who was first married to Sir Alexander Campbell of Ardkinglass in 1792, became the third wife of Thomas, 11th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in 1817; their residence was Glamis Castle (where the Queen Mother would spend a great deal of her childhood and where Princess Margaret was born). She was to have inherited Girgenti; however, she predeceased her brother. Cheape's tower Cheape is said to have believed in reincarnation, or transmigration of the soul, and to have been so convinced that he would return in the form of a bird that next to his mansion house he built a large tower with an octagonal roof, housing a dovecote on top.

The nearby ruins of Auchenharvie Castle and Darnshaw Farm are linked to stories of smuggling corpses for dissection by Glasgow medical students.Love (1989), Page 148 The tower bears a striking resemblance to the typical Italian 'Campanile' and this may reflect his interest in the Italian culture as indicated by the name 'Girgenti'. He is also said to have constructed the tower to be able see the ocean and finally the celebration of his 70th birthday could be the explanation for this folly. Later owners and residents of Girgenti House The West Lodge and remains of the old walled garden The East Lodge William Broom, an ironmaster in Glasgow, purchased the estate, after which it passed into the hands of Alexander Cochrane of Verreville in Lanarkshire.

The 1881 census records the coachman's house as being occupied by James Young of Glasgow and his wife, mother and six children. Christina Fergusson is recorded as a laundress living in the mansion house, as well as a Janetta R. Moffat from Dingwall.1881 Census. Accessed 20 November 2009.Fergussons in Stewarton area in 1881 Census. Accessed 20 November 2009. In 1900 it was sold to Glasgow Corporation for use as a reformatory for female inebriates, which opened in January 1901. (That by 1903 seventy-one inmates had been treated there, with about forty-three in residence on the average, shows the scale of the condition at that time.Girgenti Reformatory. Accessed 20 November 2009.) It had initially been intended for both men and women but became solely for women in 1901, with most of the committed women being paupers, about half of whom had been convicted for prostitution. After less than 10 years as a reformatory, the estate was sold again and transformed into a privately owned training centre for homeless boys between the ages of 14 and 20. It was next sold to the Scottish Labour Colony Association, which continued its use as a training centre. In 1918 it changed hands yet again, and this time it returned to farm use. The owner was now a Mr Muir, who was a great-grandson of the Thomas Reid of Stacklawhill from whom Cheape had purchased the estate in 1827. The farm was next sold in 1932 to Mr Sword, chairman of the Western SMT Company, who took considerable interest in the outbuildings and had the tower restored and the clock repaired. The two Italianate lodges, East and West, survive, together with part of the walled garden; the house itself was demolished in the 1940s. The farm steading is mainly original; a cottage is also present. A Mr and Mrs Smith owned and worked the farm from around 1960.

Pope John approved the Code of Rubrics by the motu proprio Rubricarum instructum of 25 July 1960.Motu proprio Rubricarum instructum of Pope John XXIII, 25 Julay 1960 The Sacred Congregation of Rites promulgated the Code of Rubrics, a revised calendar, and changes (variationes) in the Roman Breviary and Missal and in the Roman Martyrology by the decree Novum rubricarum the next day.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 52 (1960), pp. 593‚Äì740 In the Roman Breviary, the Code of Rubrics replaced the previous rules. In the Roman Missal, it replaced the sections, Rubricae generales Missalis (General Rubrics of the Missal) and Additiones et variationes in rubricis Missalis ad normam Bullae \\"Divino afflatu\\" et subsequentium S.R.C. Decretorum (Additions and alterations to the Rubrics of the Missal in line with the Bull Divino afflatu and the decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Rites that followed it). As Pope Pius X himself declared, his revision of the Psalter of the Roman Breviary was intended to be followed up by a revision of the Roman Missal.Apostolic Constitution Divino afflatu While awaiting that revision, the first of the two sections of the Roman Missal mentioned continued to be printed as before, although the second rendered some of its provisions invalid. This anomalous situation was remedied in the 1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal, which printed in their place the parts of the Code of Rubrics that concerned the Missal. In its turn, the Code of Rubrics was superseded by the General Instruction of the Roman Missal of 1970, but it remains in force for celebrations of the Roman Rite Mass in accordance with the 1962 Missal, as authorized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum of 7 July 2007.Motu proprio Summorum Pontificum of Pope Benedict XVI, 7 July 2007  Contents  The Code of Rubrics is in three parts. The first part, \\"General Rubrics\\" (Rubricae generales), gives rules concerning liturgical days such as Sundays, vigils, feasts, octaves, and matters such as the colour of the sacred vestments. The second part, \\"General Rubrics of the Roman Breviary\\" (Rubricae generales Breviarii Romani), contains rubrics specific to the Roman Breviary. The third part, \\"General Rubrics of the Roman Missal\\" (Rubricae generales Missalis Romani), contains rubrics specific to the Roman Missal. An English translation of the Code of Rubrics, revised calendar, and changes (variationes) is available in The New Rubrics of the Roman Breviary and Missal: Translation and Commentary by the Rev. Patrick L. Murphy. Another English translation of the Code of Rubrics and changes, from The New Liturgy: A Documentation, 1903-1966 by Rev. Kevin Seasoltz, is available at Divinum Officium. The text of the Code of Rubrics in Latin is available at Ordo Divini Officii Recitandi Sacrique Peragendi and, together with a parallel French translation, at Code des Rubriques - 1960.  Some changes  A number of rubrical changes were introduced, including a new system of ranking the various liturgical days of the Roman rite (as days of the first, second, third, or fourth class) that superseded the traditional ranking of Sundays and feast days as doubles of varying degrees and simples. Simplifications included elimination of many of the patristic readings at Matins and a reduction in the number of commemorations to be observed in the Office and Mass. Several changes were introduced into the rituals to be observed at Mass, such as eliminating the requirement for the celebrant to read the Epistle and Gospel at the altar during solemn Mass while the texts were chanted by the subdeacon and deacon, respectively. In association with the Code of Rubrics new typical editions of the Roman Breviary and Missal were issued, incorporating in the text the changes introduced by the Code of Rubrics. The revised Breviary was issued in 1961, within the same year as the Code of Rubrics; the revised Roman Missal, the last whose title, Missale Romanum ex decreto sacrosancti Concilii Tridentini restitutum linked it to the sixteenth-century Council of Trent,Missale Romanum ex decreto sacrosancti Concilii Tridentini restitutum Summorum Pontificum cura recognitum in 1962.

To prevent him from developing mental health problems, he was raised in a virtual reality machine which created a simulated world that kept pace with his own scale of time. When it became clear that this method was not helping, his grandmother, Iris Allen, took him back in time to the present where The Flash, Wally West, tricked Bart into a race around the world. By forcing Bart into an extreme burst of speed, Wally managed to shock his hyper-metabolism back to normal.Flash (vol. 2) #92 (July 1994) Because he had spent the majority of his childhood in a simulated world, Bart had no concept of danger and was prone to leaping before he looked. The youth proved to be more trouble than Wally could handle, and he was pawned off onto retired superhero speedster Max Mercury, who moved Bart to Manchester, Alabama. In Impulse #50, it was revealed that Batman actually named Bart \\"Impulse\\" as a warning, not a compliment. Iris West Iris West discovered that she and her brother were sharing access to the Speed Force, and decided to end that symbiotic relationship, taking all the power into herself. Jesse Chambers, guided by the late Johnny Quick, uses her Speed formula to save Iris' life. Iris embraces her new role, choosing to take up the mantle of Impulse, which Bart used before he joined the Teen Titans as Kid Flash.Flash: Rebirth #5 (January 2010) In other media Television =Animated= * In the original Kids' WB pitch for the Justice League animated series, Robin, Impulse, and a teenage female version of Cyborg were to be seen as junior members of the League. It was later decided to avoid their introduction, so as to avoid making Justice League seem like the old Super Friends series. The corresponding short animation is available as a bonus on the season one DVD of Justice League. * Bart Allen appears as Kid Flash in an episode of Mad, voiced by Jason Marsden. He joins the other superheroes in a musical number that asks Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends.\\" His part involved telling them that they would prove their worth if they sit through Twilight with him. * Jason Marsden reprises his role as Bart Allen in the Young Justice episode \\"Bloodlines\\". He is first seen in the year 2056 working on a time machine and being wished a farewell from an unknown person in a Belle Reve jumpsuit. He then travels back to the year 2016 and is transported inside Mount Justice where he is confronted by Nightwing, Robin, and Beast Boy. After trying to escape, he is stopped by Nightwing. He tells the three heroes that he is the grandson of Barry Allen and Iris West Allen and that he is a time-traveling tourist, but they could call him Impulse. To prove that he is from the future, he reveals the secret identities of all three heroes. Impulse then escapes and heads to Central City to meet his family. When he meets his grandparents, he inadvertently reveals that his grandmother is pregnant with twins, a boy and a girl, and also meets the retired Flash, Jay Garrick, and the retired Kid Flash, Wally West (who is Allen's first cousin once removed). The reunion is cut short when a villain calling himself Neutron attacks Central City. Impulse joins his grandfather and cousin in fighting the villain. During the battle, it is revealed that he's actually faster than Kid Flash and close to Flash's speed. When it seems that Neutron is going to overload and explode for a second time, Flash attempts to take him to the desert. This attempt fails when Impulse joins him and seems to accidentally trip the both of them. Neutron explodes again, but the two are saved by Kid Flash and Jay Garrick. Impulse then returns to the regenerating Neutron and throws an unknown device at him, which turns him into an ordinary human. When the other heroes ask him what happened, Impulse claims he has no idea how Neutron became human again. Later on back at the Mount Justice, Nightwing confirms through a DNA test that Impulse is who he claims to be. Impulse then enters his time machine intending to return to the future, but the machine was damaged and he claims that he has no idea how to fix it. The episode ends showing a flashback to 2056, just before Allen leaves for the past. The unknown person is revealed to be an older Neutron, who gives Allen the device that can cure him and informs him that he will not be able to return to the future. The flashback also reveals that Allen is going back to the past to save his grandfather's life and save the future. After he leaves Neutron is altered out of his jumpsuit into regular clothes, only to realize that nothing else changed. In the episode \\"Before the Dawn\\", it is revealed that his main reason for coming to the past was to stop Blue Beetle from becoming evil and causing a Reach apocalypse. In the second-season finale, \\"Endgame,\\" Bart becomes the new Kid Flash after the apparent \\"death\\" of Wally West. =Live action= * An episode of Smallville entitled \\"Run\\" featured a speedster named Bart Allen, portrayed by Kyle Gallner. Bart also carried around identification with the names \\"Jay Garrick\\", \\"Barry Allen\\", and \\"Wally West\\", the first three Flashes in the main DC Universe. He was portrayed as a self-centered teenager who used his powers as a thief for personal gain, although he showed signs of changing his ways by the end of the episode when he helped Clark save his father. As a sort of in- joke, he flirted with Chloe Sullivan and told her that he is from 100 years in the future (he jokingly claimed that they were still in love by that point). At the end of the episode, after Bart said that he will travel the world to find others like him and Clark, maybe starting \\"a club or a league or something\\", Clark and Bart had a race; just as Clark seemed to be catching up to him, Bart turned and gave him a slight wave and disappeared into the distance. Gallner reprised his role in the season six episode \\"Justice\\", using the codename Impulse and wearing a costume of sorts for the first time on air. He appeared as part of a team led by Green Arrow. According to Green Arrow, he found Bart one night in Star City during one of his patrols and saw that he was about to help himself to a \\"free meal\\", but, seeing goodness in Bart, he helped give him \\"direction\\". Along with Aquaman and Cyborg, they formed a team to stop Lex Luthor and his LuthorCorp 33.1 project, the group rescuing Bart from a lab after he was captured. During missions, he was called \\"Impulse,\\" a name he did not choose himself, much like in the comics. He was composed as more of a fusion of various Flash traits and personalities. When Clark and Lex disappeared from the arctic in the Fortress of Solitude, Bart and Victor Stone searched the entire southern hemisphere for them and found nothing. Later, Oliver mentioned that Clark went on a JL mission with Bart in Keystone City and he was seen along with AC, Victor, and Dinah on Chloe's computer screens in the Isis Foundation. Kyle Gallner returned once again in the season 8 finale \\"Doomsday\\" to help Clark fight his biggest enemy yet. However, he eventually turned his back on Clark in order to save him. He was last seen at Jimmy Olsen's funeral, and Chloe later mentioned to Clark that Bart, along with teammates Oliver and Dinah, disappeared from the face of the Earth and that she feared the worst. Bart's name is mentioned in the season 9 episode \\"Escape\\" when Clark tells Chloe that Bart is in town for the weekend. Impulse gets later mentioned (by codename) in the season 9 episode \\"Checkmate\\" by Amanda Waller, demanding to know everyone who had ever worked with Watchtower (a.k.a. Clark and Chloe). In the season 10 episode \\"Icarus\\", Impulse attends Carter Hall's funeral but his face is not shown. In the Season 11 comic book continuation of the television series, Bart sacrifices his life, sending the Black Flash into the Speed Force, along with himself. However, Clark later meets a mother and a child when he time travels to the 30th century, and the latter's name is revealed to be \\"Bartholomew Allen\\" and he bears a resemblance to his namesake, suggesting a possibility that the boy is either Bart himself (ironically making his claim to Chloe true) or Bart's descendant, the latter giving Clark hope that he is still alive but trapped in the speed force. * In the Arrow/Flash crossover episode \\"The Brave and the Bold\\", Captain Quentin Lance mistakenly calls Barry Allen \\"Bart Allen\\", though Barry later corrects Quentin; his first name is actually Bartholomew. John Wesley Shipp revealed that there are talks about having Bart Allen on The Flash. In The Flash episode \\"Cause and Effect\\", Barry's memory is accidentally erased in a S.T.A.R. Labs mishap. When he learns his name is Bartholomew Henry Allen from his driver license, the amnesiac Barry insists on being called \\"Bart\\", as that name \\"feels more natural\\" to him. Once his memories return, he resumes being called Barry. Video games In Injustice: Gods Among Us, Bart Allen's name is listed on a hit list during Deathstroke's outro.

She was beatified by Archbishop Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI in 2009. On 6 December 2014 Pope Francis recognized a miracle that had been attributed to her intercession which was a requirement for her canonization. The date of her canonization was announced alongside others passed for canonization on 14 February 2015 and she was canonized on 17 May 2015. Life Born Soultaneh Maria Ghattas on 4 October 1843 to a Palestinian family in Jerusalem, she spent her whole life working among the poor of Palestine. When she was 14, Ghattas joined the Congregation of St. Joseph of the Apparition as a postulant. In 1862 after her vows, she was sent to teach catechism in Bethlehem. There she also established religious associations promoting devotion to Mary through the rosary. In Bethlehem, she claimed several apparitions of Mary directing her to found a Palestine congregation known as the \\"Sisters of the Rosary\\". In 1880 seven young girls prepared by Joseph Tannous, priest of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, received the religious habit of the new foundation from the hands of Patriarch Bracco. That same year, Ghattas received a dispensation from Rome to leave the community of the Sisters of St. Joseph and entered the new congregation. She received the habit from the hands of Bishop Pascal Appodia, Auxiliary and Patriarchal vicar, on the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary, 7 October 1883. On 7 March 1885, together with eight other sisters, she professed her final vows in the new order in the presence of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Vincent Bracco. Ghattas dedicated her life to parish ministry and the care and education of Palestinian girls, and the community quickly grew. In 1886 she founded a school for girls in Beit Sahour. Then she was sent to Salt in Transjordan with three sisters, then in Nablus, before returning in Jerusalem because of her health. After having recovered, she went to the house of Zababdeh. In 1917, she went to Ein Karem to found an orphanage in Ein Karem. She died there on the Feast of the Annunciation 25 March 1927. Beatification The rite of beatification was presided over by Archbishop Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, and special envoy of Pope Benedict XVI, at a Mass celebrated by Patriarch Fouad Twal, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, on 22 November 2009 at the Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth. Pope Francis approved a second miracle to her on 6 December 2014 and canonized her on 17 May 2015. The ceremony was attended by more than 2,000 Christian pilgrims from the Middle East and by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\\"The Pope Canonizes Four New Saints\\", Diocese of Orlando Four days before the canonization of Marie-Alphonsine Danil Ghattas, the Vatican announced a treaty that reaffirms Palestinian statehood by the Holy See.

A British Army officer, he fought in India, served as a diplomat in Tehran, and travelled across the Pamirs. These days he is primarily remembered as an author of several books about India, Persia (modern day Iran), and Central Asia of the 19th century. Early life Gordon was born on 12 January 1832 in Aberdeen and was a twin son of Captain William Gordon (1788‚Äì1834) of the 2nd Queen's Royal Regiment. His father served in the Peninsular War in Spain, and was married at Santar√©m, in 1818, to Marianna Carlotta Loi Gon√ßalves de Mello, daughter of Luiz Gon√ßalves de Mello, a Spanish government official in the province of Estremadura. William Gordon was one of the sons of Adam Gordon of Griamachary Kildonan (1750‚Äì1831), whose sons and grandsons included 13 commissioned officers, a Surgeon-General, Huntly George Gordon; and a Lord Advocate, Edward Gordon, Baron Gordon of Drumearn. Alongside his twin brother, Sir John James Hood Gordon, Thomas entered the British Army, joining the 29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot on 21 August 1849. He served in the Indian Mutiny campaign of 1857‚Äì1858. Later he became Military Attach√© and Oriental Secretary to the British Legation in Tehran. During his visits to Persia Gordon decided to publish an account of his journey with the intention of displaying, through his observations and illustrations, evidence of the \\"progress and improvement\\" he found. In 1896 his work, Persia Revisited, was published. In 1873‚Äì1874, he participated in the Second Yarkand Mission led by Thomas Douglas Forsyth. The main goal of the expedition was to meet Yakub Beg, the ruler of Chinese Turkestan. Gordon also joined a party that traveled west to the Pamirs and Wakhan. Gordon was accompanied on the mission by John Biddulph, Ferdinand Stoliczka, Henry Walter Bellew, Henry Trotter, and R. A. Champman.

It was recently thought have only one species (the type species, described in 1775, Pemphis acidula ) but is now believed to have at least two. Pemphis acidula, bonsai Pemphis are highly adaptive. Depending on environmental factors, they are densely branched, or low and spreading bushes or short trees, with main stems that can be furcated and lie nearly prone, or develop into one erect trunk. Leaves can be small, fleshy and succulent, or larger, flat and not fleshy. All surfaces are covered generally in silky, colorless trichomes. The fruits and bee-pollinated flowers are produced throughout the year. Seeds can float, and are sometimes propagated through water dispersal.  Habitat  Most Pemphis live either at the verges of mangrove forests, well away from the forest-ocean interface; or they colonize beaches behind the intertidal zone, taking hold on rocks, gravel or sand, laterite or limestone, and frequently on promontories or crags.  Range and distribution  They are not common, but far ranging from coastal, eastern Africa (including the Seychelles, and the Zanzibar Archipelago), states with Indian Ocean coastlines, to the Pacific (Philippines, Cook Islands), northwards up to Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands Other places reporting Pemphis include mainland coastal Tanzania, Thailand, Malaysia (Johore), Singapore, Indonesia (Papua, Sumatra, the Moluccas, Madura and Java), Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong and throughout tropical Australia. On Java in particular (where it is known as stigi or santigi), some areas are uncharacteristically abundant.  Uses  Despite the difficulty presented for the prospective carver, wood from Pemphis species is highly prized for its extreme heaviness, toughness and resistance to warping. It is usually fashioned into walking canes, fence posts, tool handles, and even anchors, exhibiting a fine finish. Pemphis acidula is a valuable tropical species for bonsai, particularly in Asia.

The Love Bracelet (styled L‚äùVe, with the horizontal line inside the letter \\"O\\" alluding to the bracelet's locking mechanism) is a piece of jewelry designed in 1969 by Aldo Cipullo for Cartier SA. Early versions of the Love Bracelet featured gold plating, while more recent designs are created from solid gold or platinum. Prices for the bracelets differ depending on the item's materials, and some can exceed $56,000. As of 2019, the Love Bracelet is still in production and Cartier has expanded the line to include products based on the original bracelet's design, including cufflinks, rings, earrings, necklaces, and watches. In 2006 the line was considered to be the \\"most successful collection in Cartier's history.\\" The bracelet has received some criticism over its design, which some have compared to medieval chastity belts. Love Bracelets have also posed issues, with airline security personnel and a Transportation Security Administration agents stating in 2015 that the bracelets were \\"the biggest problem item\\" due to the need for airline passengers to remove all metal items when passing through Airport security metal detectors and because a tool is needed to remove the bracelets. In the 1990s, Cartier filed a lawsuit against multiple jewelry stores in Manhattan and Puerto Rico, alleging that the stores were selling counterfeit Love Bracelets. The classic version of the love bracelet starts at $6,300 USD for the yellow and pink gold versions, with white gold offered at $6,750. The locking mechanism Unlike other more traditional bracelets, which are either wide enough to slip over the hand onto the wrist or can readily be opened in order to put them on, the Love bracelet is designed to be opened only by using a special screwdriver that is supplied with every bracelet. The screwdriver is also available in the form of a necklace, allowing the bracelet to be \\"locked\\" onto one person, while the \\"key\\" is kept around the neck of another, as a symbol for their commitment to their relationship. Variations Cartier has offered the Love bracelet in 18k yellow gold, 18k \\"pink\\" (rose) gold, 18k white gold, and in platinum. Platinum has since been discontinued. Some bracelets are offered with diamonds in place of or in rotation with the screw-motif. Ceramic details and special colored precious gems have been offered as well. Pave diamond versions were made available in 2009. Cuff versions that do not close or lock are also available. More recently, a smaller \\"thin\\" version of the Love bracelet became available. The locking mechanism on the thin version involves a hinge and only a single screw. In June 2006, Cartier introduced the Love charity bracelet, a version consisting of a silk cord and a golden ring bearing the word LOVE. Cartier donates $150 from the sale of each bracelet to a variety of charities, each backed by a celebrity. The 2009 version of the charity bracelet was promoted by actress Eva Mendes.

Born in Turin, Duke Charles died in Moncalieri at about seven, falling by his bed. His duchy was therefore inherited by his granduncle Philip II (reigned 1496-1497), the male heir of the Savoy line. Charles's heir-general was his underage sister Violante Ludovica, who was married to Philip's eldest son Philibert the Handsome. Violante however died in 1499, 12 years old and childless, leaving the 18-year-old Philibert (who had succeeded his elderly father as Duke in 1497) a widower.

As a 12-year-old, Bhriguvanshi would follow his brother, Vibhor, to the basketball courts of Udai Pratap College in Varanasi every evening. Within weeks, he competed in the Varanasi U-13 district meet, and soon developed a liking towards the sport. Within a year of playing basketball, Bhriguvanshi represented his district and state in 2000. He kept developing exponentially and six years later, at age 17, bagged himself a spot on the Senior Indian men's team. Growing up with a father who was a lecturer and a mother who was a principal, there was pressure on Bhriguvanshi to perform academically. However, Bhriguvanshi had other things in mind. Professional career Bhriguvanshi began playing competitive basketball in 2009 at the Asian Club Championships. In 2017, Bhriguvanshi averaged 30.8 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 11 games for Bengaluru Beast in the United Basketball Alliance of India Pro Basketball League. In one match against rival Hyderabad, he poured in 57 points and registered 11 assists. On 7 July 2017, Bhriguvanshi signed a one-year training deal with the Adelaide 36ers of the Australian National Basketball League, becoming the league's first Indian player. He did not appear in a game for the 36ers during the 2017‚Äì18 NBL season. He is the first Indian to be signed by Australia's National Basketball League (NBL) in 2017. National team career Bhriguvanshi made his debut for the India national basketball team in 2009 at the FIBA Asia Championship. He has since competed at the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship, 2013 FIBA Asia Championship, 2014 FIBA Asia Cup, 2015 FIBA Asia Championship, and 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge. At the 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge in Iran, Bhriguvanshi averaged a career-best 16.9 points per game, to go with 4.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.5 steals in eight games. Championship Vishesh has helped India to win a 3x3 basketball gold medal at the Asian Beach Games in 2008 and has since been playing in every major FIBA Asia Championship and representing India. He has won three national champions domestically with Indian Railways and, in 2011, was appointed by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation as its Brand ambassador.

Glory surrounds her head and the aegis of Minerva signifies the armor of righteousness and wisdom.Cole, John et al. (1997). The Library of Congress, W. W. Norton & Company. p. 113 The rule of law is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \\"[t]he authority and influence of law in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.\\"Oxford English Dictionary online (accessed September 13, 2018; spelling Americanized). The phrase \\"the rule of law\\" is also sometimes used in other senses. See Garner, Bryan A. (Editor in Chief). Black's Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, p. 1448. (Thomson Reuters, 2009). . Black's provides five definitions of \\"rule of law\\": the lead definition is \\"A substantive legal principle\\"; the second is the \\"supremacy of regular as opposed to arbitrary power\\". The term rule of law is closely related to constitutionalism as well as Rechtsstaat and refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule. Use of the phrase can be traced to 16th-century Britain and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it in arguing against the divine right of kings. John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that does not apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty. \\"The rule of law\\" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers. Aristotle wrote: \\"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens.\\" The rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including people who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials and judges.Hobson, Charles. The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law, p. 57 (University Press of Kansas, 1996): according to John Marshall, \\"the framers of the Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature.\\" In this sense, it stands in contrast to tyranny or oligarchy, where the rulers are held above the law. Lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and monarchies, when there is neglect or ignorance of the law. The rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it. History Although credit for popularizing the expression \\"the rule of law\\" in modern times is usually given to A. V. Dicey,Bingham, Thomas. The Rule of Law, p. 3 (Penguin 2010). development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including ancient Greece, Mesopotamia, India, and Rome.Black, Anthony. A World History of Ancient Political Thought (Oxford University Press 2009). Antiquity In the West, the ancient Greeks initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men. Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law.David Clarke, \\"The many meanings of the rule of law\\" in Kanishka Jayasuriya, ed., Law, Capitalism and Power in Asia (New York: Routledge, 1998). Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that \\"Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state.\\"Cooper, John et al. Complete Works By Plato, p. 1402 (Hackett Publishing, 1997). More than Plato attempted to do, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws. In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law: > It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon > the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some > particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the > servants of the laws.Aristotle, Politics 3.16 The Roman statesman Cicero is often cited as saying, roughly: \\"We are all servants of the laws in order to be free.\\"In full: \\"The magistrates who administer the law, the judges who act as its spokesmen, all the rest of us who live as its servants, grant it our allegiance as a guarantee of our freedom.\\" Original Latin: \\"Legum ministri magistratus, legum interpretes iudices, legum denique idcirco omnes servi sumus ut liberi esse possimus.\\" During the Roman Republic, controversial magistrates might be put on trial when their terms of office expired. Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (legibus solutus), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.Wormuth, Francis. The Origins of Modern Constitutionalism, p. 28 (1949). In China, members of the school of legalism during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted \\"rule by law\\" as opposed to \\"rule of law\\", meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.Xiangming, Zhang. On Two Ancient Chinese Administrative Ideas: Rule of Virtue and Rule by Law, The Culture Mandala: Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies (2002): \\"Although Han Fei recommended that the government should rule by law, which seems impartial, he advocated that the law be enacted by the lords solely. The lords place themselves above the law. The law is thereby a monarchical means to control the people, not the people's means to restrain the lords. The lords are by no means on an equal footing with the people. Hence we cannot mention the rule by law proposed by Han Fei in the same breath as democracy and the rule of law advocated today.\\" Bevir, Mark. The Encyclopedia of Political Theory, page 162. Munro, Donald. The Concept of Man in Early China. p. 4. Guo, Xuezhi. The Ideal Chinese Political Leader: A Historical and Cultural Perspective. p. 152. In contrast, the Huang‚ÄìLao school of Daoism rejected legal positivism in favor of a natural law that even the ruler would be subject to. There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the Old Testament, the book of Deuteronomy imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use). According to Professor Bernard M. Levinson, \\"This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented....\\"Levinson, Bernard. \\"The First Constitution: Rethinking the Origins of Rule of Law and Separation of Powers in Light of Deuteronomy\\", Cardozo Law Review, Vol. 27, No. 4, pp. 1853‚Äì1888 (2006). The Deuteronomic social vision may have influenced opponents of the divine right of kings, including Bishop John Ponet in sixteenth-century England.Brett, Mark G. ‚ÄúNational Identity as Commentary and as Metacommentary‚Äù, in Historiography and Identity (Re)formulation in Second Temple Historiographical Literature, p. 32 (Jonker, ed.)

Middle Ages In Islamic jurisprudence rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the caliph.Weeramantry, Christopher (1997). Justice without Frontiers, p. 132 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. Alfred the Great, Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the Doom Book) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by Leviticus 19:15: \\"You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow.\\" In 1215, Archbishop Stephen Langton gathered the Barons in England and forced King John and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by Magna Carta in return for exacting taxes.Magna Carta (1215) translation, British LibraryMagna Carta (1297) U.S. National Archives. This foundation for a constitution was carried into the United States Constitution. In 1481, during the reign of Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Constituci√≥ de l'Observan√ßa was approved by the General Court of Catalonia, establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the Principality of Catalonia.Ferro, V√≠ctor: El Dret P√∫blic Catal√†. Les Institucions a Catalunya fins al Decret de Nova Planta; Eumo Editorial; Early Modern Period The first known use of this English phrase occurred around AD 1500.Oxford English Dictionary (OED), \\"Rule of Law, n.\\", accessed April 27, 2013. According to the OED, this sentence from about 1500 was written by John Blount: \\"Lawes And constitutcions be ordeyned be cause the noysome Appetit of man maye be kepte vnder the Rewle of lawe by the wiche mankinde ys dewly enformed to lyue honestly.\\" And this sentence from 1559 is attributed to William Bavand: \\"A Magistrate should..kepe rekenyng of all mennes behauiours, and to be carefull, least thei despisyng the rule of lawe, growe to a wilfulnes.\\" Another early example of the phrase \\"rule of law\\" is found in a petition to James I of England in 1610, from the House of Commons: > Amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's > subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings > and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear > and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain rule of the > law which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth > to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government ...Hallam, > Henry. The Constitutional History of England, vol. 1, p. 441 (1827). In 1607, English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke said in the Case of Prohibitions (according to his own report) \\"that the law was the golden met- wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.).\\" Among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was Samuel Rutherford in Lex, Rex (1644).Rutherford, Samuel. Lex, rex: the law and the prince, a dispute for the just prerogative of king and people, containing the reasons and causes of the defensive wars of the kingdom of Scotland, and of their expedition for the ayd and help of their brethren of England, p. 237 (1644): \\"The prince remaineth, even being a prince, a social creature, a man, as well as a king; one who must buy, sell, promise, contract, dispose: ergo, he is not regula regulans, but under rule of law ...\\" The title, Latin for \\"the law is king\\", subverts the traditional formulation rex lex (\\"the king is law\\"). James Harrington wrote in Oceana (1656), drawing principally on Aristotle's Politics, that among forms of government an ‚ÄúEmpire of Laws, and not of Men‚Äù was preferable to an ‚ÄúEmpire of Men, and not of Laws‚Äù. John Locke also discussed this issue in his Second Treatise of Government (1690): > The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, > and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have > only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to > be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in > the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any > law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in > it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. > 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and > not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have > a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by > the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all > things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the > inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of > nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.Locke, John. > Second Treatise of Civil Government, Ch. IV, sec. 22 (1690). The principle was also discussed by Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws (1748).Tamanaha, Brian. On the Rule of Law, p. 47 (Cambridge University Press, 2004). The phrase \\"rule of law\\" appears in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary (1755).Peacock, Anthony Arthur, Freedom and the rule of law, p. 24. 2010. In 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, Thomas Paine wrote in his pamphlet Common Sense that \\"in America, the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other.\\"Lieberman, Jethro. A Practical Companion to the Constitution, p. 436 (University of California Press 2005). In 1780, John Adams enshrined this principle in Article VI of the Declaration of Rights in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: > No man, nor corporation, or association of men, have any other title to > obtain advantages, or particular and exclusive privileges, distinct from > those of the community, than what arises from the consideration of services > rendered to the public; and this title being in nature neither hereditary, > nor transmissible to children, or descendants, or relations by blood, the > idea of a man born a magistrate, lawgiver, or judge, is absurd and > unnatural.Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780), Part the > First, Art. VI. The influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world.  Meaning and categorization of interpretations  The Oxford English Dictionary has defined rule of law this way: > The authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a > constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle > whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are > considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes. Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by divine right. Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as \\"an exceedingly elusive notion\\". Among modern legal theorists, one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a formalist or \\"thin\\" definition, and a substantive or \\"thick\\" definition; one occasionally encounters a third \\"functional\\" conception.Tamanaha, Brian. ‚ÄúThe Rule of Law for Everyone?‚Äù, Current Legal Problems, vol. 55, via SSRN (2002). Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the \\"justness\\" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law. Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics. For instance, such theorists claim that law requires generality (general rules that apply to classes of persons and behaviors as opposed to individuals), publicity (no secret laws), prospective application (little or no retroactive laws), consistency (no contradictory laws), equality (applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (certainty of application for a given situation), but formalists contend that there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law. The \\"formal\\" interpretation is more widespread than the \\"substantive\\" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law. This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of \\"rule of law\\" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights. The best known arguments for the formal interpretation have been made by A.V Dicey, F.A.Hayek, Joseph Raz, and Joseph Unger. The substantive interpretation preferred by Dworkin, Laws, and Allan, holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights. The functional interpretation of the term \\"rule of law\\", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the \\"rule of law\\" with the \\"rule of man\\".Stephenson, Matthew. \\"Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy\\", World Bank Research (2008). According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of \\"rule of law\\", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of \\"rule of law\\". Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are justifiable under natural law but not statutory law. The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable. The ancient concept of rule of law can be distinguished from rule by law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: \\"The difference ... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion.\\"Tamanaha, Brian 2004). On the Rule of Law. Cambridge University Press. p. 3 Status in various jurisdictions thumbupright=2.05 The rule of law has been considered as one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and good governance of a country.Kaufman, Daniel et al. \\"Governance Matters VI: Governance Indicators for 1996‚Äì2006, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 4280\\" (July 2007). Research, like the Worldwide Governance Indicators, defines the rule of law as: \\"the extent to which agents have confidence and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, the police and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime or violence.\\" Based on this definition the Worldwide Governance Indicators project has developed aggregate measurements for the rule of law in more than 200 countries, as seen in the map at right.\\"Governance Matters 2008\\" , World Bank. Europe The preamble of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms says \\"the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law\\". In France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (Etat de droit and Rechtsstaat respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see public law), particularly the legislature. France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law. The German interpretation is more \\"rigid\\" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom. Finland's constitution explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that \\"the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed.\\" =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from Magna Carta in 1215 and the Bill of Rights 1689.See also In the 19th century, A. V. Dicey, a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the British constitution in his classic work Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty. Americas =United States= All government officers of the United States, including the President, the Justices of the Supreme Court, state judges and legislators, and all members of Congress, pledge first and foremost to uphold the Constitution. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader.Vile, Josh (2006). A Companion to the United States Constitution and its Amendments. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 80 At the same time, the federal government has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its enumerated powers and respects the constitutionally protected rights of individuals. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of judicial discretion,Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824): \\"When [courts] are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it.\\" and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including prosecutorial discretion. Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the \\"rule of law\\", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word \\"law\\" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being \\"defined by formal or substantive criteria\\", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria.Harrison, John. \\"Substantive Due Process and the Constitutional Text,\\" Virginia Law Review, vol. 83, p. 493 (1997). Law Professor Frederick Mark Gedicks disagrees, writing that Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.Gedicks, Frederick. \\"An Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: Magna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the Fifth Amendment\\", Emory Law Journal, vol. 58, pp. 585‚Äì673 (2009). See also Edlin, Douglas, \\"Judicial Review without a Constitution\\", Polity, vol. 38, pp. 345‚Äì368 (2006). Some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by legal realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes and Roscoe Pound. For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: \\"The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\\"Tamanaha, Brian. How an Instrumental View of Law Corrodes the Rule of Law, twelfth annual Clifford Symposium on Tort Law and Social Policy. Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: \\"no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.\\" That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed \\"you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers.\\" By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked \\"the ordinary legal manner\\" of the courts, further review of the facts by \\"the ordinary Courts of the land\\" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your \\"day in commission\\", the rule of law did not require a further \\"day in court\\". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.Ernst, Daniel R. (2014). Tocqueville's Nightmare: The Administrative State Emerges in America, 1900‚Äì1940. Oxford University Press. James Wilson said during the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 that, \\"Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect.\\" George Mason agreed that judges \\"could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course.\\"Snowiss, Sylvia. Judicial Review and the Law of the Constitution, pp. 41‚Äì42 (Yale University Press 1990). Chief Justice John Marshall (joined by Justice Joseph Story) took a similar position in 1827: \\"When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law.\\"Ogden v. Saunders, . This was Marshall's only dissent in a constitutional case. The individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner later denounced Marshall for this part of his Ogden dissent. See These same issues were also discussed in an earlier U.S. Supreme Court case, Calder v. Bull, , with Justices James Iredell and Samuel Chase taking opposite positions. See Presser, Stephen. \\"Symposium: Samuel Chase: In Defense of the Rule of Law and Against the Jeffersonians\\", Vanderbilt Law Review, vol. 62, p. 349 (March 2009). Asia East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, Confucianism, which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and Legalism, which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state.Chu, Yun-Han et al. How East Asians View Democracy, pp. 31‚Äì32. According to Awzar Thi, a member of the Asian Human Rights Commission, the rule of law in Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent: > Apart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is > a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the > police force is favor over the rich and corrupted. In Cambodia, judges are > proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political > prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary > criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate > the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall > asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a > decade?Thi, Awzar. \\"Asia needs a new rule-of-law debate\\", United Press > International, UPIAsia.com (2008-08-14). In countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights.Peerenboom, Randall in Asian Discourses of Rule of Law, p. 39 (Routledge 2004). The rule of law in China has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China. In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice. Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century. In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators. In India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. Although the Constitution of India may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion, the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise judicial review.Baxi, Upendra in Asian Discourses of Rule of Law, pp. 336‚Äì337 (Routledge 2004). According to Indian journalist Harish Khare, \\"The rule of law or rather the Constitution [is] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges.\\"Robinson, Simon. \\"For Activist Judges, Try India\\", Time Magazine (2006-11-08). Japan had centuries of tradition prior to World War II, during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.Green, Carl. \\"Japan: 'The Rule of Law Without Lawyers' Reconsidered\\" , Speech to the Asia Society (2001-03-14).See also Organizations Various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.  The Council of Europe  The Statute of the Council of Europe characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: \\"Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy.\\" The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization. International Commission of Jurists In 1959, an event took place in New Delhi and speaking as the International Commission of Jurists, made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the Declaration of Delhi. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to judicial review.Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. ‚ÄúLegislative Sovereignty and the Rule of Law\\" in Tom Campbell, Keith D. Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), Sceptical Essays on Human Rights (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 69. United Nations The Secretary-General of the United Nations defines the rule of law as:What is the Rule of Law?, United Nations Rule of Law. > a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, > public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that > are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, > and which are consistent with international human rights norms and > standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the > principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to > the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, > participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of > arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency. The General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions.See United Nations General Assembly Resolutions A/RES/61/39, A/RES/62/70, A/RES/63/128. The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law,See United Nations Security Council debates S/PRST/2003/15, S/PRST/2004/2, S/PRST/2004/32, S/PRST/2005/30, S/PRST/2006/28. and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security,See United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820. children in armed conflict,E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1612. and the protection of civilians in armed conflict.E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674. The Peacebuilding Commission has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda.United Nations and the Rule of Law. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action also requires the rule of law be included in human rights education.Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action Part II, paragraph 79 Additionally, the Sustainable Development Goal 16, a component of the 2030 Agenda is aimed at promoting the rule of law at national and international levels. International Bar Association The Council of the International Bar Association passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or \\"thick\\" definition of the rule of law:Resolution of the Council of the International Bar Association of October 8, 2009, on the Commentary on Rule of Law Resolution (2005). > An independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right > to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate > approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict > protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; > equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the > Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite > detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; > intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. > The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a > transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to > principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries > to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to > speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities. World Justice Project As used by the World Justice Project, a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld:About the WJP. > # The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law; > # The laws are clear, publicized, stable, fair, and protect fundamental > rights, including the security of persons and property; # The process by > which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, > and efficient; # Access to justice is provided by competent, independent, > and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial > officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect > the makeup of the communities they serve. The World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The WJP Rule of Law Index is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law ‚Äì such as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice.Agrast, M., Botero, J., Ponce, A., WJP Rule of Law Index 2011. Washington, DC: The World Justice Project. (2011). International Development Law Organization The International Development Law Organization (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them. It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity.IDLO Strategic Plan It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world.IDLO Mission and History The International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law: > More than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice > and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they > are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and > procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is > inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access > to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the > viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains > them.IDLO ‚Äì Rule of Law IDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in The Hague and has Permanent Observer Status at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.  International Network to Promote the Rule of Law  The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective. INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States. Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights. INPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices. Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues. In relation to economics One important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law's impact on economic development. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter to economic development or not?Luis Flores Ballesteros. \\"Corruption and development. Does the 'rule of law' factor weigh more than we think?\\" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 15 Nov 2008. Constitutional economics is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the judiciary, which, in many transitional and developing countries, is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors. The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.Peter Barenboim, \\"Defining the rules\\", The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009 The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term \\"rule of law\\" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy.Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. \\"The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform\\", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007). The \\"rule of law\\" primarily connotes \\"protection of property rights\\". The economist F. A. Hayek analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: \\"under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts.\\" Studies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments. In relation to culture The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or Roerich Pact is an inter-American treaty. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes, and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010. The Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935, by the representatives of 21 American states in the Oval Office of the White House (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.Elisabeth Stoumatoff, FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict is the first international treaty that focuses on the protection of cultural property in armed conflict. It was signed at The Hague, Netherlands on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states. The rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is intellectual property. Under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization, nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant piracy, including an increase in peer-to-peer file sharing. Similarly, in Russia, tax evasion is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable. Bribery likewise has different normative implications across cultures.  In relation to education  Education has an important role in promoting the rule of law (RoL) and a culture of lawfulness. In essence, it provides an important protective function by strengthening learners‚Äô abilities to face and overcome difficult life situations. Young people can be important contributors to a culture of lawfulness, and governments can provide educational support that nurtures positive values and attitudes in future generations. Through education, learners are expected to acquire and develop the cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural experiences and skills they need to develop into constructive and responsible contributors to society. Education also plays a key role in transmitting and sustaining socio-cultural norms and ensuring their continued evolution. Through formal education, children and youth are socialized to adopt certain values, behaviours, attitudes and roles that form their personal and social identity and guide them in their daily choices. As they develop, children and youth also develop the capacity to reflect critically on norms, and to shape new norms that reflect contemporary conditions. As such, education for justice promotes and upholds the principle of the RoL by: * Encouraging learners to value, and apply, the principles of the RoL in their daily lives, and; * Equipping learners with the appropriate knowledge, values, attitudes, and behaviours they need to contribute to its continued improvement and regeneration in society more broadly. This can be reflected, for instance, in the way learners demand greater transparency in, or accountability of, public institutions, as well as through the everyday decisions that learners take as ethically responsible and engaged citizens, family members, workers, employers, friends, and consumers etc. Global Citizenship Education (GCE) is built on a lifelong learning perspective. It is not only for children and youth but also for adults. It can be delivered in formal, non-formal and informal settings. For this reason, GCE is part and parcel of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 on Education (SDG4, Target 4.7). A competency framework based on a vision of learning covers three domains to create a well-rounded learning experience: Cognitive, Socio-Emotional and Behavioural. Educational policies and programmes can support the personal and societal transformations that are needed to promote and uphold the RoL by: * Ensuring the development and acquisition of key knowledge, values, attitudes and behaviours. * Addressing the real learning needs and dilemmas of young people. * Supporting positive behaviours. * Ensuring the principles of the RoL are applied by all learning institutions and in all learning environments.

He has competed for several promotions, and currently competes for Impact Zone Wrestling (IZW), a territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) based in Phoenix, Arizona. He has also wrestled in several other promotions and was signed to a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for several years. Much of his career has been connected with fellow wrestler Mike Knox, as the two have held championships together as a tag team and have feuded on multiple occasions. Baseball career Before entering professional wrestling, Neikirk played catcher for the Mesa Community College baseball team in the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference (ACCAC). In 1996, he was named to the All-ACCAC Team. That year, he was picked by the Detroit Tigers in the 19th round of the Major League Baseball Draft At age 21, Neikirk played in Detroit's rookie-class, minor league team, the Gulf Coast League Tigers of the 1996 Gulf Coast League in Lakeland, Florida. He played catcher in 18 games out of a 60-game season. His statistics were as follows: 47 plate appearances, 38 at bats, 8 hits, 4 runs, 1 run batted in (RBI), 5 walks, 7 strikeouts, and 8 total bases. Also, Neikirk ground into a double play 4 times, was hit by a pitch 3 times, and made 1 sacrifice hit. He had a batting average of .211, an on-base percentage of .348, a slugging percentage of .211, and an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .558. That same year, Neikirk was promoted to the high-A-class, minor-league team, the Visalia Oaks, of the 1996 California League, in Visalia, California. While there, he played catcher in 9 games out of a 140-game season. His statistics were as follows: 29 plate appearances, 27 at-bats, 4 hits, 3 runs, 2 RBIs, 2 walks, 9 strikeouts, and 4 total bases. He also had a batting average of .148, an on-base percentage of .207, a slugging percentage of .148, and an OPS of .355. In 1999, at age 24, Neikirk returned to baseball playing for the independent minor league team, the Adirondack Lumberjacks, of the 1999 Northern League, in Glens Falls, New York. While there, he played catcher in 42 games out of an 86-game season. His statistics were as follows: 118 at- bats, 31 hits, 3 doubles, 1 triple, 2 home runs, and 42 total bases. He had a batting average of .263 and a slugging percentage of .356. On a weighted- average, 80-point scale, Neikirk's Baseball Cube scouting report is as follows: :*Power:39 :*Batting:22 :*Speed:43 :*Contact:43 :*Patience:62 Wrestling Throughout his professional wrestling career, Neikirk has competed primarily in the United States. He was also wrestled in Egypt and has worked for the World Wrestling Alliance in Europe and for Enezma in Mexico. Much of his career has been spent portraying a heel (villain) through an arrogant demeanor and by turning on allies. Early career Neikirk trained under Les Thatcher for a career in professional wrestling. In 2002, he formed a tag team known as The A Squad with Chet Jablonski. On July 10, 2002, The A Squad defeated Ice Cream Man and Cody Hawk to win the HWA Tag Team Championship, although this title reign is not recorded in the company's official history. That year, Neikirk was rated number 481 on Pro Wrestling Illustrated's annual PWI 500 list of the top wrestlers in the world. On August 31, 2003, Neikirk wrestled a match on WWE's Sunday Night Heat television program in which he was defeated by Test. In 2003, he improved his PWI 500 ranking and was placed at number 442. He later wrestled for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where he formed a tag team with Mike Knox. The team was also part of a stable known as The Outlaws. Neikirk and Knox later moved to IZW, where they were known as Team Elite. They defeated Navajo Warrior and Hawaiian Lion on January 18, 2005 to win the IZW Tag Team Championship. They held the title belts until March 15, when they dropped them to California Connection (Peter Goodman and Antonio Mestre). On January 6, 2004, Neikirk turned on Knox by superkicking him in the face. He explained this action by saying that he was tired of carrying the team and that Knox had \\"dropped the ball\\". That night, Neikirk and Kox faced each other as part of a six-man match, but Neikirk turned on his teammates and left the ring. Neikirk and Knox had a blow off match on May 25. Neikirk won the match, but the referee then reversed his decision and awarded the victory to Knox. World Wrestling Entertainment =Deep South Wrestling (2005‚Äì2007)= In 2005, he and Knox were signed by World Wrestling Entertainment and was sent to the Deep South Wrestling (DSW), which was a developmental territory for WWE. They resumed wrestling together as Team Elite. Competing as a singles wrestler, Neikirk won the DSW Heavyweight Championship on December 22 that year by defeating Mike Mizanin. He finished the year ranked number 367 in the PWI 500. He held the Heavyweight Championship for six months before dropping it to Roughhouse O'Reilly. On August 3, 2006, Team Elite faced High Impact (Mike Taylor and Tony Santarelli) for the DSW Tag Team Championship. Neikirk and Knox lost the match, which led to them splitting up and feuding. They faced each other at several DSW house shows, with Knox winning most of the matches. At the same time, Neikirk also teamed with Roughhouse O'Reilley to wrestle The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guide and Tony Mamaluke) on several house shows promoted by WWE's Extreme Championship Wrestling. In 2006, he achieved his highest ranking on the PWI 500, as he was rated number 310. =Florida Championship Wrestling (2007‚Äì2008)= In 2007, Team Elite reunited and won the DSW Tag Team Championship on March 8 with a victory over The Major Brothers. They held the title until WWE ended its association with DSW on April 18, 2007. Neikirk and Knox were sent to Florida Championship Wrestling, another WWE developmental territory, where they continued to form a tag team. Neikirk also appeared on WWE's Extreme Championship Wrestling program as one of Paul Heyman's bodyguards. In January 2008, he was suspended by WWE for a violation of the company's Wellness Program. He was released from his WWE contract on January 8. Return to IZW He then returned to Impact Zone Wrestling, where he won the NWA Arizona Heavyweight Championship on December 30, 2008 in a match against G.Q. Gallo. The match ended in controversy, however, because both men's shoulders were on the mat as the referee counted the pinfall. Neikirk raised his shoulder just before the final count and was awarded the victory and the title belt. The title was declared vacant until the two men could face each other again on January 27, 2009. This rematch ended in a draw, but Gallo defeated Neikirk to win the vacant title on March 10. Neikirk regained the title, which had been renamed the Arizona Heavyweight Championship, that summer. He held the belt until dropping it to Mike James on August 11. NWA Representative Greg DeMarco then tried to strip James of the belt and return it to Neikirk, but Neikirk refused to accept the title.

To the end user, it appears as though the program has simply \\"paused\\" to request further input, whereas in reality, most resources are released while the input is waiting to be received. Transparent termination and restart The controlling program has deliberately saved most of its state during the delay, terminated, and then, on being restarted through new input, restores its previous state. A single control variable is usually retained to hold the current state in terms of the stage of input reached (and therefore what must be recovered at any stage in order to resume processing). The state, including the control variable, is usually preserved in a 'temporary storage record' that maps the variables needing restoration as an aggregate set, usually contained in a single structure (other variables will be re-initialized on restart). Conserving resources This method of programming frees up pooled resources (such as memory) for an indeterminate time. This delay is the end- user 'thinking time' (or response time) and depends on human factors including speed of typing. For systems supporting many thousands of users on a single processor, it allows the transparent 'look and feel' of a true conversational session without tying up limited resources.

Irish was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional right- arm medium pace bowler who played club cricket for Sidmouth and Minor Counties cricket for Devon from the mid-1930s. At the end of August 1939, in between Devon games, he also played for Somerset's second eleven in non-competitive matches against Glamorgan's second eleven. After successful seasons for Devon in the immediate post-war years, Irish was recruited as a professional by Somerset for the 1950 season and immediately became a regular in the side, batting at No 3. In his first first-class match, a friendly against Glamorgan, he made 76 and 25, and the 76 was to be his highest first-class score. Just a few days later, he top-scored for his side with 67 on his County Championship debut against Sussex. And a week later in Somerset's next match he made 36 and 70 against Middlesex at Lord's. As the season progressed, though, Irish found runs harder to come by and he passed 50 only once more in an innings, making an unbeaten 75 in the return match with Sussex at Worthing. He was injured soon after this innings and, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"after missing many matches he decided to give up full-time cricket\\". Irish went back to Minor Counties' cricket with Devon for a few seasons, also playing for the Minor Counties representative side against the 1952 Indian team, a two-day match that was not first-class. He also continued to play for and captain the Sidmouth team. He ran a barber's shop and tobacconists in Sidmouth.

Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are often flavored with rosewater, mastic, Bergamot orange, or lemon. The confection is often packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with icing sugar, copra, or powdered cream of tartar to prevent clinging. Other common flavors include cinnamon and mint. In the production process, soapwort may be used as an emulsifying additive. The origin of the confection is not precisely known, but the candy is known to have been produced in Turkey as early as the late 18th century.  History  Rosewater-flavored Turkish delight Several Turkish Delight variants prominently featuring dried coconut A variation on Turkish delight surrounded by layers of nougat and dried apricot Kaymak lokum, Turkish delight of cream, a speciality of Afyonkarahisar Fruit-flavoured rahat from Romania The exact origin of these sweets is yet to be definitively determined; however, the Turkish word lokum comes from the Arabic al-lukum. In the Arab world, Turkish delights are called rƒÅ·∏•at al-·∏•ulq≈´m (ÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ≠Ÿéÿ© ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸèŸÑŸíŸÇŸèŸàŸÖ) which means \\"throat comfort\\". According to the Hacƒ± Bekir company, Bekir Efendi, named Hacƒ± Bekir after performing the Hajj, moved to Constantinople from his hometown Kastamonu and opened his confectionery shop in the district of Bah√ßekapƒ± in 1777. He produced various kinds of candies and lokums, later including a unique form of lokum made with starch and sugar. The family business, now in its fifth generation, still operates under the founder's name. Tim Richardson, a historian of sweets, has questioned the popular attribution of Hacƒ± Bekir as the inventor of Turkish delight, writing that \\"specific names and dates are often erroneously associated with the invention of particular sweets, not least for commercial reasons\\". Similar Arab and Persian recipes, including the use of starch and sugar, predate Bekir by several centuries.Richardson, Tim (2003). Sweets, a History of Temptation, p. 51. Bantam Press, London. .Brown, Jonathan. \\"The Lion, the Witch & the Turkish Delight\\", The Independent, London, 5 December 2005. Retrieved on 5 December 2005. The Oxford Companion to Food states that although Bekir is often credited with the invention, there is no hard evidence for it. Name The Turkish names lokma and lokum are derived from the Arabic word luqma(t) and its plural luq≈´m meaning \\"morsel\\" and \\"mouthful\\"Diran K√©l√©kian, Dictionnaire Turc-Fran√ßais (Ottoman Turkish), 1911 and the alternative Ottoman Turkish name, rahat-ul hulk√ºm,James Redhouse, A Turkish and English Dictionary, 1856, p.707. was an Arabic formulation, rƒÅ·∏•at al-hulq≈´m, meaning \\"comfort of the throat\\", which remains the name in formal Arabic.Hans Wehr, A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, 1966, p.365 In Libya, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Tunisia it is known as ·∏•alq≈´m, while in Kuwait it is called ŸÉÿ®ÿØŸá ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿ≥ \\"kabdat alfaras;\\" in Egypt and Lebanon it is called ' ( ) or  ïagameyya, and in Syria rƒÅ·∏•a. Its name in various Eastern European languages comes from Ottoman Turkish lokum or rahat-ul hulk√ºm. Its name in Greek, ŒªŒøœÖŒ∫ŒøœçŒºŒπ (loukoumi) shares a similar etymology with the modern Turkish and it is marketed as Greek Delight. In Cyprus, where the dessert has protected geographical indication (PGI), it is also marketed as Cyprus Delight. In Armenian it is called lokhum (’¨’∏’≠’∏÷Ç’¥). Its name in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Israel is rahat lokum, and derives from a very old confusion of the two Ottoman Turkish names found already in Ottoman Turkish; indeed this mixed name can also be found in Turkey today. Its name in Serbo-Croatian is ratluk, a reduced form of the same name. In Persian, it is called rƒÅhat-ol-holqum ().Colin Turner, A Thematic Dictionary of Modern Persian, 2004 In English, it was formerly alternatively known as Lumps of Delight.Oxford English Dictionary  Around the world  Europe =Bulgaria= In Bulgarian, Turkish Delight is known as lokum (–ª–æ–∫—É–º) and enjoys some popularity. While it presumably came with the Ottoman Empire, it may have arrived earlier, as the Middle East has been very influential to the country in terms of cuisine. Bulgaria produces its own brands of lokum, which may be plain or spiced with rose petals, white walnuts, or \\"endreshe\\". =Greece= In Greece, Turkish Delight, known as loukoumi [ŒªŒøœÖŒ∫ŒøœçŒºŒπ] has been a very popular delicacy since the 19th century, famously produced in the city of Patras, Patrina loukoumia, as well as on the island of Syros and the northern Greek cities Thessaloniki, Serres and Komotini but elsewhere as well. Loukoumi is a common traditional treat, routinely served instead of biscuits along with coffee. In addition to the common rosewater and bergamot varieties, Mastic-flavored loukoumi is available and very popular. Another sweet, similar to loukoumi, that is made exclusively in the town of Serres, is Akan√©s. =Romania and Moldova= The Romanian word to describe this confection is rahat, an abbreviation of the Arabic rahat ul-holkum.LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu, Influen»õa orientalƒÉ asupra limbii »ôi culturii rom√¢ne»ôti, 1900 However, in the Romanian language, the word rahat took a pejorative sense, in this case a euphemism that translates as crap. According to linguist LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu, Turkish words which entered the Romanian language in the seventeenth century and eighteenth century became mostly obsolete and acquired a pejorative or ironic sense. Politically and socially, this weakened the influence of Ottoman society, and parts of the Ottoman Turkish language which had not had time to take root in the Romanian language took a touch of irony and became a mine for humorous literature. Rahat is eaten as is or is added in many Romanian cakes called cornule»õe, cozonac or . =Albania and Former Yugoslavia= In the countries of former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia), as well as in Albania, Turkish delight is known as rahat-lokum, ratluk or lokum. It was introduced during Ottoman rule of the Balkans and has remained popular. Today it is commonly consumed with coffee. Rose and walnut are the most common flavorings. North America The Nory Candy company in the Greater Los Angeles area has been producing Turkish Delights or Rahat Locum since 1964. The company produces different fruit and exotic flavors including rose and licorice as well a variety which include nuts such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts. In 1930, two Armenian immigrants, Armen Tertsagian and Mark Balaban, founded Liberty Orchards of Cashmere, Washington, and began manufacturing \\"Aplets\\" (apple and walnut locoum) and \\"Cotlets\\" (apricot and walnut locoum). In 1984, they added the medley-flavored \\"Fruit Delights\\" line in strawberry, raspberry, orange, blueberry, peach, cranberry, and pineapple assortments. Although all of these confections are marketed under American-style brand names, they are referred to on product packaging as \\"Rahat Locoum\\". In Canada, the Big Turk chocolate bar made by Nestl√© consists of dark magenta Turkish Delight coated in milk chocolate. Brazil The confection is known in Brazil as Manjar Turco, Del√≠cia Turca, Bala de Goma S√≠ria or Bala de Goma √Årabe. As with most Middle Eastern dishes, it came with the Levantine Arab diaspora to Latin America. Britain and other Commonwealth nations Fry's Turkish Delight is marketed by Cadbury in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and South Africa and can also be found in Canada and New Zealand.

The short is essentially a clip show, in that the majority of the footage is reused from earlier cartoons. Plot The plot features an elderly Foghorn Leghorn and Barnyard Dawg sitting peacefully and exchanging old stories during a game of checkers. Their grandsons outside overhear their talk and imitate their old actions. The flashbacks between Foghorn and Dawg use footage from the following cartoons: (in order of appearance) * Henhouse Henery (1949): The scene where Dawg runs into the fence that Foghorn painted to make look like an open gate, and when Foghorn runs into a mill to create a baseball bat to use against Dawg who steals it; only a new bit of animation is made showing Foghorn coming out of the workshop apparently unscathed telling the audience \\"That, I say, that dawg keeps a-pitchin' 'em and I keep a-duckin' 'em!\\", but proves himself wrong when after briefly going back in, he falls over in a daze after coming back out. It also makes up the final clip in the cartoon, where Foghorn scares Dawg out of his dog house and proceeds to paint his tongue green. * The High and the Flighty (1956): The scene where Foghorn gives Dawg a rigged spring bone, only in this case, not sold to Foghorn by Daffy but rather received by Foghorn in the mail. * All Fowled Up (1955): The scene where Foghorn tries to blow a stick of dynamite through a tube at Dawg, but it backfires.

Igl√≥i coached runners such as S√°ndor Iharos, Istv√°n R√≥zsav√∂lgyi, L√°szl√≥ T√°bori, Bob Schul and Jim Beatty. Counting both outdoors and indoors, and distances no longer officially recognized, Igl√≥i's students achieved 49 world records. Igl√≥i's athletic career and rise to fame as a coach Igl√≥i was a notable runner in the 1930s. A multiple-time Hungarian champion, Igl√≥i participated in the 1500 metres at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but was eliminated in the heats. Igl√≥i became the coach of Honv√©d Budapest, then the Hungarian army club, in 1950, and the results of his pupils steadily improved. The first world records for the Honv√©d Budapest runners came as team efforts in the uncommon 4 √ó 1500 m relay in 1953 and 1954. Wholesale individual record breaking began on May 14, 1955, with S√°ndor Iharos beating Gaston Reiff's old 3000 metres record in Budapest with a time of 7:55.6. By the end of that year, Iharos held the world records over 1500 metres, 3000 metres, two miles and 5000 metres. Istv√°n R√≥zsav√∂lgyi had smashed the previous record over 2000 metres by almost five seconds with a time of 5:02.2; this was arguably the most impressive single mark by any of Igl√≥i's Hungarian pupils, and lasted longer than any of Iharos' records. (It was eventually broken by Michel Jazy on June 14, 1962 with a time of 5:01.6.) L√°szl√≥ T√°bori had tied Iharos' 1500m mark, and had become the third man in the world to run a four-minute mile. 1956 Melbourne Olympics As the form of Igl√≥i's students continued in the Olympic year 1956, with both R√≥zsav√∂lgyi and Iharos running further world records, team Hungary seemed poised to take the lion's share of medals in the long track events. However, that was not to be. The team's mentality and spirit was badly shaken as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was bloodily crushed by the Soviet military just weeks before the Melbourne Olympics. Iharos missed Melbourne entirely due to an ankle injury. T√°bori and R√≥zsav√∂lgyi underperformed and finished out of medals. Career in the United States Igl√≥i (and T√°bori) did not return to the communist Hungary after the Olympics. They moved to the United States and eventually migrated to the west coast, with Igl√≥i becoming the coach of the Los Angeles Track Club and later the Santa Monica Track Club. Though T√°bori stayed in good shape and continued to compete, his international career was effectively over, as he could no longer run for Hungary and was not yet a US citizen. Igl√≥i, however, now had access to a talented generation of American runners, several of whom would eventually make an international impact. On February 10, 1962, Jim Beatty became the first man to run a four-minute mile indoors. Beatty also set world records over two miles both outdoors and indoors and American records over many other distances. Bob Schul became a world-beater in 1964, running a new two mile world record (8:26.4) and winning the Olympic 5000 metres in Tokyo that year with an impressive last lap sprint. However, injuries forced both Schul and Beatty to retire prematurely. Still continuing his coaching career, Igl√≥i moved to Greece in 1970, but did not meet with similar success there. After the fall of communism in Hungary he moved back to his native country, and died in Budapest in 1998. Training methods The key to Igl√≥i's methods was interval training. Arduous training sessions twice a day sought to develop both speed and stamina. A typical Igl√≥i session involved tens of repetitions of sprints of up to 400 metres with only short jog recoveries, distance run in the longest and hardest sessions totaling up to as much as 35 kilometers. Compared to other similar interval training systems, Igl√≥i's had an emphasis on repetitions of such short sprints as 100 or 200 metres. His method was also inspired by the 'style' running of the 1930s Arnd Kr√ºger (2006), Training Theory and Why Roger Bannister was the First Four-Minute Miler. 'Sport in History'. 26:2, 305-324 in that he never used a stop watch but regarded his runners intensely and broke up the set of intervals when the described speed (e.g. 'good swing tempo') could no longer be run as relaxed as demanded Arnd Kr√ºger, 'Mihaly Igloi. The man and the system', in Runners' World (ed.), Guide to distance running (Mountain View, CA, 1969), p. 168.

Development Launched in 1923 were BSA's new 350cc sidevalve was designated the Model L and fitted with a three-speed, hand-change gearbox and chain final drive. This BSA was introduced as one of the last flat-tank models, the Model L that was available with either a side-valve or an overhead-valve 349cc, four stroke engine with bore and stroke of 72mm x 85.5mm. The overhead-valve model was the company's first such model but it otherwise shared all of its running gear with its side-valve stablemate including a three-speed, hand-change, constant-mesh gearbox, an Amac carburettor and chain final drive. Front and rear braking was achieved by a friction pad being applied to a dummy rim built into the wheel spokes ‚Äì not an uncommon practise on veteran machines and derived from building similar brakes onto a belt-drive rim. Although lubrication was achieved with a mechanical oil pump, the rider could adjust the oil flow depending upon the engine's duty conditions via an adjuster mounted on the tank that included a sight glass through which to observe the flow rate. In its first year, the side-valve Model L was immediately successful.

The last item is moved to the first location, which has been vacated. * In a list, removing the tail and inserting it at the head. * In machine code (and assembly language) moving all bits in a register to the right, with the rightmost (least significant bit) becoming the leftmost. Tree rotation In a binary search tree, a right rotation is the movement of a node, X, down to the right. This rotation assumes that X has a left child (or subtree). X's left child, R, becomes X's parent node and R's right child becomes X's new left child. This rotation is done to balance the tree; specifically when the left subtree of node X has a significantly (depending on the type of tree) greater height than its right subtree. Right rotations (and left) are order preserving in a binary search tree; it preserves the binary search tree property (an in-order traversal of the tree will yield the keys of the nodes in proper order). AVL trees and red-black trees are two examples of binary search trees that use a right rotation. A single right rotation is done in O(1) time but is often integrated within the node insertion and deletion of binary search trees. The rotations are done to keep the cost of other methods and tree height at a minimum. References * Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L.

The film crew had faced tough challenges as heavy snowfall where up to 40 feet of snowfall happened during the season and shooting at Himalayas and Glaciers to capture never seen visuals and untold story. Doors To Kedarnath: Synopsis A centuries-old temple, Kedarnath is a sacred pilgrimage site for many millions across India. Located high in the Himalayas, Kedarnath valley is snowbound for half the year. The Temple's doors are closed before winter sets in, and each year, an epic struggle against time and terrain is waged by governmental agencies to make the Yatra possible. The film takes one behind the scenes, to explore the monumental task of preparation for the very first time, riveting, never- before-seen visuals of a snowbound Kedarnath captured by the Nat Geo crew first time on Indian television, as they followed the main players who put together the logistics for this Yatra. Along the way to opening the doors, the film explores many narratives- Kedarnath temple has withstood the test of time and topography many times over, from being buried by snow during the Little Ice Age to surviving the devastating disaster of 2013- it is a temple that excites imaginations of countless devotees. A massive pilgrimage site, the yatra provides many their bread and butter- religious tourism in this area increasingly forming the bedrock of the local economy, and it's only going to get bigger and better. Follow the characters on their own journeys, their struggles and their unique relationships with- the Doors to Kedarnath.

It is placed in the genus Trachylepis, which is otherwise mostly restricted to Africa, and its type locality may be in error. It is an unstriped, olive- brown, grayish animal, with dark spots all over the body.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 293 Its taxonomic history is complex due to confusion with Trachylepis atlantica from the Atlantic Ocean island of Fernando de Noronha and doubts regarding its type locality. T. maculata was first described, as Tiliqua maculata, by Gray in 1839 on the basis of three specimens said to be from Demerara, Guyana. On the same page, Gray described Tiliqua punctata from the island of Fernando de Noronha off Brazil. In 1887, the two names were considered by Boulenger to pertain to the same species, which was initially named Mabuya punctata but renamed Mabuya maculata by Anderson in 1900, because the latter name was preoccupied by an older name. In 1935, Dunn disputed that the two were identical, reinstated Mabuya punctata as the name for the Noronha species, apparently unaware that the name is preoccupied, and considered maculata to be the same as Mabuya mabouya. In 1946, Travassos again synonymized the two, naming the Noronha skink as Mabuya maculata.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 292 In the early 2000s, the matter was revisited by Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, who examined the type specimens of punctata and maculata. They noted that punctata differs from maculata in having five instead of three keels on the dorsal scales; generally fewer scales; parietal scales separated, not in contact as in punctata; and fewer subdigital lamellae below the fourth finger and toe. Consequently, they regarded the two as representing distinct species and recommended that the Fernando de Noronha species be named Mabuya atlantica and the Guyana one Mabuya maculata.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 294 In 2002, it was realized that the genus Mabuya was not a natural grouping and a mainly African group of species which also includes the Fernando de Noronha skink was transferred to a separate genus, first named Euprepis and later Trachylepis. Since then, this species has been known as Trachylepis atlantica.Miralles et al., 2009 In 2009, Miralles and coworkers again considered the taxonomy of maculata, referring it to Trachylepis instead of Mabuya because the third supraocular and frontal are in contact, as in other species of Trachylepis. It also has auricular lobules and heavy keels on the dorsal scales. They were the first to use the current name combination, Trachylepis maculata.Miralles et al., 2009, p. 62 The origin and nature of T. maculata are still unclear. The collection from Demerara which included T. maculata included various species that have not been found in Guyana again, including some restricted to Caribbean islands or to other parts of South America. Consequently, Mausfeld and Vrcibradic suggested that T. maculata may be the same as similarly colored Caribbean Mabuya species or the Venezuelan Mabuya falconensis, but these differ from T. maculata in a number of characters, indicating their membership in Mabuya instead of Trachylepis. T. maculata may in fact have come from Guyana, perhaps inadvertently introduced into Guyana from Africa, and subsequently become extinct; alternatively, the three known specimens may have been collected in Africa. Among African Trachylepis, Trachylepis perrotettii is regarded as most similar to T. maculata. References Literature cited *Miralles, A., Chaparro, J.C. and Harvey, M.B. 2009.

He served as an assistant coach for a national champion at Michigan and three undefeated and untied seasons at Penn State. White served in the United States Army during World War II causing a break in his collegiate education. Personal White was born in Wadley, Georgia and raised in River Rouge, Michigan. White earned his bachelor's degree in education from Michigan in 1948. He earned his master's degree in education at Michigan. White married the former Verna McQueen, and they had one son, Brian. Verna and White were married for 53 years before she died at 75 in October 1997 of emphysema. Athletic career At River Rouge High School he played baseball, basketball and football before attending Ohio State. In 1942, he lettered in both basketball and football at Ohio State as a sophomore. He was a player for national champions on both the 1942 Ohio State Buckeyes football team and the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team. He is one of only three players (along with Justin Boren and Howard Yerges) to have played for the football teams of both Michigan and Ohio State; this low number can be attributed to the strong rivalry between the two schools. White matriculated at The Ohio State University, where he earned a varsity letter playing for Paul Brown's 1942 team. White played at Ohio State for two years. He served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1945 during World War II and lettered two years for Fritz Crisler's Michigan teams. His younger brother, Paul was captain at Michigan when White transferred. J. T. was the starting center for the 1946 and 1947 teams. The Football Writers Association of America named him as their second- team All-American center for the 1947 college football season. White played in the 1948 College All-Star Game, and he was drafted by two pro teams: the Detroit Lions with the first pick of the 21st round (186th overall) in the 1947 NFL Draft and the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference. Coaching career He chose to join Bennie Oosterbaan's Michigan coaching staff for six years (1948-53), including the national champion 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team. Then, for 26 seasons, from 1954 through 1979, J.T. was a defensive line coach at Penn State, first under Rip Engle and then under Joe Paterno, who took over in 1966. When White moved to Penn State to work for Engle, the staff included Paterno, Earle Bruce, Sever Toretti, Jim O'Hora and Jim Patrick. His tenure on the staff included three undefeated and untied seasons (1968, 1969 and 1973). Subsequently, from 1980-1982, he served as assistant to the Penn State Athletic Director.

Its main characteristic is the bright and gold color, hence their common name \\"capim dourado\\", which literally means \\"golden grass\\". The making of handicrafts from S. nitens began in Jalap√£o, in the Afro-Brazilian community of Mumbuca in the municipality of Mateiros. Indigenous people, probably from the Xerente ethnic group, taught the art to local inhabitants when passing through the region around the 1930s. The handicrafts are made of coils of S. nitens scapes sewn tightly together with strips from the Moriche Palm's (Mauritia flexuosa) young leaves. For decades the handicrafts were only made by women for household uses and/or sporadic selling. Today, there are at least 12 local community associations. The handicrafts are usually sold in small shops of local artisan associations.SCHMIDT, I. B.; FIGUEIREDO, I. B.; SCARIOT, A. 2007.

Ruhland (Eriocaulaceae), a NTFP from Jalap√£o region, Central Brazil Syngonanthus nitens' flowering starts in July and seeds are produced from the beginning of September through October. The Tocantins State Government, through its Environmental Agency (Naturatins), established a regional law (Portaria 55/2004 and 092/2005) allowing scape harvesting only after September 20, and requiring flowerhead cutting and dispersal in the grassland areas just after scape harvesting. This regional law can be an efficient tool for contributing to the sustainability of S. nitens handicraft activities. References Schmidt, I. B.; Figueiredo, I. B.; Sampaio, M. B. 2007.

Overview Deleuze used the term virtual to refer to an aspect of reality that is ideal, but nonetheless real. An example of this is the meaning, or sense, of a proposition that is not a material aspect of that proposition (whether written or spoken) but is nonetheless an attribute of that proposition. Both Henri Bergson, who strongly influenced Deleuze, and Deleuze himself build their conception of the virtual in reference to a quotation in which writer Marcel Proust defines a virtuality, memory as \\"real but not actual, ideal but not abstract\\". A dictionary definition written by Charles Sanders Peirce, referencing the philosophy of Duns Scotus, supports this understanding of the virtual as something that is \\"as if\\" it were real, and the everyday use of the term to indicate what is \\"virtually\\" so, but not so in fact.Peirce, C.S. \\"Virtual.\\" Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, ed. James Mark Baldwin. New York: Macmillan, 1902 (Vol. II, pp. 763-764). Deleuze argues that Henri Bergson developed \\"the notion of the virtual to its highest degree\\" and that he based his entire philosophy on it.Deleuze (1966, 43). In Bergsonism, Deleuze writes that \\"virtual\\" is not opposed to \\"real\\" but opposed to \\"actual\\", whereas \\"real\\" is opposed to \\"possible\\".Deleuze (1966, 96-98). This definition, which is almost indistinguishable from potential, originates in medieval Scholastics and the Medieval Latin word virtualis. Deleuze identifies the virtual, considered as a continuous multiplicity, with Bergson's \\"duration\\": \\"it is the virtual insofar as it is actualized, in the course of being actualized, it is inseparable from the movement of its actualization.\\"Deleuze (1966, 42-43, 81) and Deleuze (2002a, 44). Other concepts Another core meaning has been elicited by Denis Berthier, in his 2004 book \\"M√©ditations sur le r√©el et le virtuel\\" (\\"Meditations on the real and the virtual\\"), based on uses in science (virtual image), technology (virtual world), and etymology (derivation from virtue‚ÄîLatin virtus). At the same ontological level as \\"the possible\\" (i.e. ideally-possible) abstractions, representations, or imagined \\"fictions\\", the actually-real \\"material\\", or the actually-possible \\"probable\\", the \\"virtual\\" is \\"ideal-real\\". It is what is not real, but displays the full qualities of the real‚Äîin a plainly actual (i.e., not potential)‚Äîway. The prototypical case is a reflection in a mirror: it is already there, whether or not one can see it; it is not waiting for any kind of actualization. This definition allows one to understand that real effects may be issued from a virtual object, so that our perception of it and our whole relation to it, are fully real, even if it is not. This explains how virtual reality can be used to cure phobias. Brian Massumi shows the political implications of this. However, note that the writers above all use terms such as \\"possible\\", \\"potential\\" and \\"real\\" in different ways and relate the virtual to these other terms differently. Deleuze regards the opposite of the virtual as the actual. Rob Shields argues that the opposite of the virtual is the material for there are other actualities such as a probability (e.g., \\"risks\\" are actual dangers that have not yet materialized but there is a \\"probability\\" that they will).Shields, Rob The Virtual Routledge 2003. The virtual is far more than a technical or communications term. Martin Luther argued in his writing The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ‚ÄîAgainst the Fanatics with other Protestants, most notably Zwingli, over the virtualism of the Christian Eucharist, in alignment with Catholic tradition, that the Eucharist was actually and not virtually the body and blood of Christ. According to Massumi in \\"Parables for the Virtual\\", the virtual is something \\"inaccessible to the senses\\" and can be felt in its effects. His definition goes on to explain virtuality through the use of a topological figure, in which stills of all of the steps in its transformation superposed would create a virtual image. Its virtuality lies in its inability to be seen or properly diagramed, yet can be figured in the imagination. Notes References Sources * Deleuze, Gilles. 1966. Bergsonism. Trans.

In 1949, she played the role of Louis Mazzini's mother, who was ostracised by her aristocratic family, in the film Kind Hearts and Coronets. Granddaughter of Victorian painter, Sir Luke Fildes R.A. and Welsh Sculptor Sir William Goscombe-John R.A., and son of British Olympian (√âp√©e) Luke Val Fildes, Audrey showed keen interest in acting while a student at Hayes Court School. She later related that, while at Hayes Court, she was directed in a performance of The Merchant of Venice by Alec Guinness. At the performance, he brought Peggy Ashcroft backstage and introduced Audrey to her as \\"my Portia\\". During her 20s she enjoyed an active acting career, appearing as Sonia in the celebrated production of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment with John Gielgud at the New Theatre in 1946 and as Diana in Jean Anouilh's Ring Round the Moon (1950), directed by Peter Brook and costarring Paul Scofield. She married a Canadian design consultant in 1955, and moved to Ottawa. They had two sons Paul and Nicholas before separating, following which Audrey returned to England to bring up her sons. In the early 1970s Audrey trained for a second career as a gilder and restorer at the City and Guilds of London School. In 1976 she returned to Canada, settling in Toronto. Her gilding and restoration clients included the Government of Ontario and pieces of her work remain at Queen's Park, the Provincial Parliament.

Shaw's uncle Desmond introduced him to an ancient sect of crime fighters called the Manhunters. Shaw contacted the Grand Master, the sect's leader, through a magical lion medallion. Shortly, he assumed the Manhunter name and costume from a previous Manhunter.1st Issue Special #5The unnamed Manhunter was created by Jack Kirby and first appeared in 1st Issue Special #5. Shaw reappeared in Justice League of America #140 and in a flashback in Secret Origins (vol. 2) #22. This Manhunter wore a costume similar to Paul Kirk's 1940s outfit. The Manhunter sect was composed of androids, created billions of years before by the Guardians of Oa to police the galaxy. For millennia, they served the Guardians well. The Manhunters became obsessed with the act of \\"hunting\\" criminals. Their code, \\"No Man Escapes the Manhunters\\", became more important to them than seeing justice done. Eventually, the androids rebelled against the Guardians, but were swiftly defeated by their creators. Those that survived went into hiding.Justice League of America #140 The latter-day Manhunters attempted to disgrace the Guardians with Mark Shaw at their side. They were opposed by the JLA, especially by League member Green Lantern. Shaw realized that he had been duped by the Manhunters and turned on them, killing the Grand Master, who was revealed to be a robot. Mark Shaw quickly returned as a new hero called the Privateer, but it was soon revealed that he was also working as a villain called the Star-Tsar, in league with the Key. The Red Tornado discovered this deception and Shaw went to prison.Justice League of America #149 While in the midst of serving his sentence, Shaw was offered the chance to accompany the Suicide Squad on a mission as the Privateer, and was released when the mission was completed.Suicide Squad #8‚Äì10 In the wake of the Millennium crisis, he donned a new costume to distance himself from the Manhunter cult, and had his own adventures. Shaw now hunted costumed criminals for the bounty. He kept insisting that he was just operating for the money, but he kept finding himself doing the right thing. Shaw continued working with the Suicide Squad, but left once again upon learning of a mission against Loa in New Orleans, LA.Suicide Squad #20 During this time, he and his family were threatened by two shapeshifters named Dumas. Shaw killed the first Dumas (Stephen Forrest Lee) and his battle with the second (which also ended with the villain's death) led him to give up the Manhunter identity at the end of the second series.Manhunter (vol. 2) #12 It was later revealed that Shaw was actually himself both Dumases and much of his history was actually the result of mental programming by the U.S. government.Manhunter (vol. 3) #13 Shaw joined the Shadow Fighters in order to battle the supervillan Eclipso. It was assumed that Mark Shaw was killed opposing Eclipso alongside his other team members in the Shadow Fighters. This was soon revealed not to be the case.Eclipso #11‚Äì13 He was actually undercover at the time he was facing Eclipso, masquerading as his old enemy Dumas at the behest of Sarge Steel. When the call went out for heroes to fight Eclipso, Sarge Steel believed that it would raise too many questions as to where Mark Shaw was if he did not answer the call, and Sarge Steel sent along a ringer in Mark's place. The ringer thus only appeared once and is not known to have done anything but attack Eclipso and die. In the Manhunter comic featuring Kate Spencer in the title role, Mark Shaw was approached by the Order of Saint Dumas to take up the mantle of Azrael.Manhunter (vol. 3) #28 At some point, it seems he refused, as Michael Washington Lane has now become the new Azrael. In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Mark Shaw appears in the Forever Evil storyline as a U.S. Marshal who is assigned to find Barbara Ann Minerva, a.k.a. the Cheetah. He is referred to as \\"one of the best manhunters\\" in the United States Marshal Service.Wonder Woman #23.1 ‚Äì The Cheetah #1 (Nov. 2013) Shaw was revealed to be the head of Leviathan, having taken control of the organization from Talia al Ghul, assuming its name for himself and transforming it into a highly advanced espionage agency with the goal of taking over the world, which he thought was in chaos. He took on a goal of fixing it, as he saw the constant struggle between heroes and villains, in addition to the governments making their secret maneuvers, as futile.Event Leviathan #6 In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, he accompanied Black Adam in his attack on the White House.Doomsday Clock #11. DC Comics. In other media Television Mark Shaw appears in the Arrowverse TV series. David Cubitt portrays Mark Shaw on Arrow.In the third-season episode \\"Corto Maltese\\", he is the liaison A.R.G.U.S. agent to Corto Maltese, who has gone off the grid and is unreachable. Lyla Michaels asks John Diggle to check-up on Shaw while he visits the island. Diggle finds Shaw who is in the midst of a critical undercover mission with a local cartel and offers him to help. Soon after, Shaw betrays him and steals an A.R.G.U.S. thumbdrive. Oliver Queen, Roy Harper and Diggle ambush the trade between Shaw and the cartel. After Diggle defeats him, Shaw claims Amanda Waller drove him to his insubordination. Shaw begged Diggle to tell Waller he killed Shaw so Shaw can go back to living a normal life. Diggle, knowing full well what Waller was capable of, knocked him out but agreed to do so. In \\"Al Sah-him\\", it is revealed that he became ally to H.I.V.E. and, under the orders from Damien Darhk, went to Corto Maltese to draw A.R.G.U.S. agents in order to obtain secret files.

The theorem states that if the quadratic form defines a homomorphism into the positive real numbers on the non-zero part of the algebra, then the algebra must be isomorphic to the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, or the octonions. Such algebras, sometimes called Hurwitz algebras, are examples of composition algebras. The theory of composition algebras has subsequently been generalized to arbitrary quadratic forms and arbitrary fields.See: Hurwitz's theorem implies that multiplicative formulas for sums of squares can only occur in 1, 2, 4 and 8 dimensions, a result originally proved by Hurwitz in 1898. It is a special case of the Hurwitz problem, solved also in . Subsequent proofs of the restrictions on the dimension have been given by using the representation theory of finite groups and by and using Clifford algebras. Hurwitz's theorem has been applied in algebraic topology to problems on vector fields on spheres and the homotopy groups of the classical groupsSee: and in quantum mechanics to the classification of simple Jordan algebras. Euclidean Hurwitz algebras Definition A Hurwitz algebra or composition algebra is a finite-dimensional not necessarily associative algebra with identity endowed with a nondegenerate quadratic form such that . If the underlying coefficient field is the reals and is positive-definite, so that is an inner product, then is called a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra or (finite-dimensional) normed division algebra. If is a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and is in , define the involution and right and left multiplication operators by :\\\\displaystyle{a^*=-a +2(a,1)1,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, L(a)b = ab,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, R(a)b=ba.} Evidently the involution has period two and preserves the inner product and norm. These operators have the following properties: * the involution is an antiautomorphism, i.e. , , so that the involution on the algebra corresponds to taking adjoints * if , , so that is an alternative algebra. These properties are proved starting from the polarized version of the identity : :\\\\displaystyle{2(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,bd) + (ad,bc).} Setting or yields and . Hence . Similarly . Hence , so that . By the polarized identity so . Applied to 1 this gives . Replacing by gives the other identity. Substituting the formula for in gives . Classification It is routine to check that the real numbers , the complex numbers and the quaternions are examples of associative Euclidean Hurwitz algebras with their standard norms and involutions. There are moreover natural inclusions . Analysing such an inclusion leads to the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction, formalized by A.A. Albert. Let be a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and a proper unital subalgebra, so a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra in its own right. Pick a unit vector in orthogonal to . Since , it follows that and hence . Let be subalgebra generated by and . It is unital and is again a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra. It satisfies the following Cayley‚ÄìDickson multiplication laws: :\\\\displaystyle{C=B\\\\oplus Bj, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (a+bj)^*=a^* - bj, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (a+bj)(c+dj)=(ac -d^*b) +(bc^*+da)j.} and are orthogonal, since is orthogonal to . If is in , then , since by orthogonal . The formula for the involution follows. To show that is closed under multiplication . Since is orthogonal to 1, . * since so that, for in , . * taking adjoints above. * since = 0, so that, for in , . Imposing the multiplicativity of the norm on for and gives: :\\\\displaystyle{(\\\\a\\\\^2+\\\\b\\\\^2)(\\\\c\\\\^2+\\\\d\\\\^2)=\\\\ac -d^*b\\\\^2 + \\\\bc^*+da\\\\^2,} which leads to :\\\\displaystyle{(ac,d^*b)=(bc^*,da).} Hence , so that must be associative. This analysis applies to the inclusion of in and in . Taking with the product and inner product above gives a noncommutative nonassociative algebra generated by . This recovers the usual definition of the octonions or Cayley numbers. If is a Euclidean algebra, it must contain . If it is strictly larger than , the argument above shows that it contains . If it is larger than , it contains . If it is larger still, it must contain . But there the process must stop, because is not associative. In fact is not commutative and in . ' The only Euclidean Hurwitz algebras are the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions. Other proofs The proofs of and use Clifford algebras to show that the dimension of must be 1, 2, 4 or 8. In fact the operators with satisfy and so form a real Clifford algebra. If is a unit vector, then is skew-adjoint with square . So must be even. The real Clifford algebra and its complexification act on the complexification of , an -dimensional complex space. Since is even, is odd, so the Clifford algebra has exactly two complex irreducible representations of dimension . So this power of 2 must divide . It is easy to see that this implies can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8. The proof of uses the representation theory of finite groups, or the projective representation theory of elementary Abelian 2-groups, known to be equivalent to the representation theory of real Clifford algebras. Indeed, taking an orthonormal basis of the orthogonal complement of 1 gives rise to operators satisfying :\\\\displaystyle{U_i^2=-I,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, U_iU_j=-U_jU_i \\\\,\\\\, (i e j).} This is a projective representation of a direct product of groups of order 2. ( is assumed to be greater than 1.) The operators by construction are skew- symmetric and orthogonal. In fact Eckmann constructed operators of this type in a slightly different but equivalent way. It is in fact the method originally followed in .See: Assume that there is a composition law for two forms :\\\\displaystyle{(x_1^2 + \\\\cdots +x_N^2)(y_1^2 + \\\\cdots + y_N^2) =z_1^2 + \\\\cdots + z_N^2,} where is bilinear in and . Thus :\\\\displaystyle{z_i=\\\\sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij}(x)y_j} where the matrix is linear in . The relations above are equivalent to :\\\\displaystyle{T(x)T(x)^t=x_1^2 +\\\\cdots + x_N^2.} Writing :\\\\displaystyle{T(x)=T_1x_1 + \\\\cdots + T_Nx_N,} the relations become :\\\\displaystyle{T_iT^t_j+T_jT_i^t =2\\\\delta_{ij}I.} Now set . Thus and the are skew-adjoint, orthogonal satisfying exactly the same relations as the 's: :\\\\displaystyle{V_i^2=-I,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, V_iV_j=-V_jV_i \\\\,\\\\, (i e j).} Since is an orthogonal matrix with square on a real vector space, is even. Let be the finite group generated by elements such that :\\\\displaystyle{v_i^2=\\\\varepsilon,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, v_iv_j=\\\\varepsilon v_jv_i \\\\,\\\\, (i e j),} where is central of order 2. The commutator subgroup is just formed of 1 and . If is odd this coincides with the center while if is even the center has order 4 with extra elements and . If in is not in the center its conjugacy class is exactly and . Thus there are conjugacy classes for odd and for even. has 1-dimensional complex representations. The total number of irreducible complex representations is the number of conjugacy classes. So since is even, there are two further irreducible complex representations. Since the sum of the squares of the dimensions equals and the dimensions divide , the two irreducibles must have dimension . When is even, there are two and their dimension must divide the order of the group, so is a power of two, so they must both have dimension . The space on which the 's act can be complexified. It will have complex dimension . It breaks up into some of complex irreducible representations of , all having dimension . In particular this dimension is , so is less than or equal to 8. If , the dimension is 4, which does not divide 6. So N can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8. Applications to Jordan algebras Let be a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and let be the algebra of -by- matrices over . It is a unital nonassociative algebra with an involution given by :\\\\displaystyle{(x_{ij})^*=(x_{ji}^*).} The trace is defined as the sum of the diagonal elements of and the real-valued trace by . The real-valued trace satisfies: : \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{\\\\mathbf{R}} XY = \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{\\\\mathbf{R}} YX, \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{\\\\mathbf{R}} (XY)Z = \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{\\\\mathbf{R}} X(YZ). These are immediate consequences of the known identities for . In define the associator by :\\\\displaystyle{[a,b,c]=a(bc) - (ab)c.} It is trilinear and vanishes identically if is associative. Since is an alternating algebra and . Polarizing it follows that the associator is antisymmetric in its three entries. , or lie in then the . This implies that has certain commutation properties. In fact if is a matrix in with real entries on the diagonal then :\\\\displaystyle{[X,X^2]=aI,} with in . In fact if , then :\\\\displaystyle{y_{ij}=\\\\sum_{k,\\\\ell} [x_{ik},x_{k\\\\ell},x_{\\\\ell j}].} Since the diagonal entries of are real, the off diagonal entries of vanish. Each diagonal entry of is a sum of two associators involving only off diagonal terms of . Since the associators are invariant under cyclic permutations, the diagonal entries of are all equal. Let be the space of self-adjoint elements in with product and inner product . ' is a Euclidean Jordan algebra if is associative (the real numbers, complex numbers or quaternions) and or if is nonassociative (the octonions) and . The exceptional Jordan algebra is called the Albert algebra after A.A. Albert. To check that satisfies the axioms for a Euclidean Jordan algebra, the real trace defines a symmetric bilinear form with . So it is an inner product. It satisfies the associativity property because of the properties of the real trace. The main axiom to check is the Jordan condition for the operators defined by : :\\\\displaystyle{[L(X),L(X^2)]=0.} This is easy to check when is associative, since is an associative algebra so a Jordan algebra with . When and a special argument is required, one of the shortest being due to . See: In fact if is in with , then :\\\\displaystyle{D(X) = TX -XT} defines a skew-adjoint derivation of . Indeed, : \\\\operatorname{Tr}(T(X(X^2)) -T(X^2(X)))=\\\\operatorname{Tr} T(aI) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(T)a=0, so that : (D(X),X^2)=0. Polarizing yields: : (D(X),Y\\\\circ Z)+(D(Y),Z\\\\circ X)+ (D(Z),X\\\\circ Y)=0. Setting , shows that is skew-adjoint. The derivation property follows by this and the associativity property of the inner product in the identity above. With and as in the statement of the theorem, let be the group of automorphisms of leaving invariant the inner product. It is a closed subgroup of so a compact Lie group. Its Lie algebra consists of skew-adjoint derivations. showed that given in there is an automorphism in such that is a diagonal matrix. (By self-adjointness the diagonal entries will be real.) Freudenthal's diagonalization theorem immediately implies the Jordan condition, since Jordan products by real diagonal matrices commute on for any non-associative algebra . To prove the diagonalization theorem, take in . By compactness can be chosen in minimizing the sums of the squares of the norms of the off-diagonal terms of . Since preserves the sums of all the squares, this is equivalent to maximizing the sums of the squares of the norms of the diagonal terms of . Replacing by , it can be assumed that the maximum is attained at . Since the symmetric group , acting by permuting the coordinates, lies in , if is not diagonal, it can be supposed that and its adjoint are non- zero. Let be the skew-adjoint matrix with entry , entry and 0 elsewhere and let be the derivation ad of . Let in . Then only the first two diagonal entries in differ from those of . The diagonal entries are real. The derivative of at is the coordinate of , i.e. . This derivative is non-zero if . On the other hand, the group preserves the real-valued trace. Since it can only change and , it preserves their sum. However, on the line constant, has no local maximum (only a global minimum), a contradiction. Hence must be diagonal.

Early life Pollack was born in Baltimore, Maryland and lived in a home near the intersection of Wilson and Exeter Streets during his childhood. However, the death of his mother at age 13 and the death of his father at age 15 forced him to quit school and live on the streets. Pollack found his place in the streets of Baltimore through competitive boxing. Pollack travelled the country competing for $1,500 dollar purses in lightweight title fights. At 175 pounds Pollack was a stout fighter who won acclaim for fighting men as much as 40 pounds heavier. Criminal career Pollack also made a name for himself during prohibition as a whiskey-runner. From a residence on West Fayette Street, Pollack organized whiskey smuggling under the claimed profession of \\"chauffeur\\".U.S. Bureau of the Census. Fourteenth Census of the United States: 1920-Population. Baltimore, Maryland. 9 January 1920. http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ (accessed October 18, 2009). From 1921 to 1926, Pollack was arrested 13 times on charges that ranged from assault to murder. Pollack was charged with the murder of Hugo Caplan in 1921 during the hijacking of a contraband whiskey truck. Two years later, Pollack was acquitted of the charges and the files disappeared from the State's Attorney's office in 1948. Pollack gained some local fame within from his prohibition activities. Political career Pollack gained notoriety and political success during the 1930s with the creation of the Trenton Democratic Club. He used his ties with Baltimore politician William Curran to form a political base amongst area Democrats. Pollack saw major involvement in the Baltimore court system as a tool for political success. His relationships with jurists made him well known for payoffs, bribery, and corruption. In 1954, he beat a charge on obstruction of justice in which he pressured defendants in a series of corruption trials. Pollack was well respected despite some blatant criminal activity while in politics. He was appointed to the Maryland State Athletic Commission in 1933 by Governor Albert Ritchie.

This guerrilla campaign was ultimately defeated. The IRA called a ceasefire in April 1923 and \\"dumped arms\\" the following month. This phase of the war was characterised by small-scale military actions but also by assassinations and executions on both sides. The Free State also imprisoned up to 13,000 IRA fighters. In addition, the campaign saw the destruction of a great deal of infrastructure such as roads and railways by the IRA. Start of the guerrilla war Government victories in the major towns inaugurated a period of guerrilla warfare. After the fall of Cork, Liam Lynch ordered Anti-Treaty IRA units to disperse and form flying columns as they had when fighting the British. They held out in areas such as the western part of counties Cork and Kerry in the south, County Wexford in the east and counties Sligo and Mayo in the west. Sporadic fighting also took place around Dundalk, where Frank Aiken and the Fourth Northern Division of the Irish Republican Army were based and Dublin, where small scale but regular attacks were mounted on Free State troops. Among the casualties of the guerrilla attacks was Commander-in-Chief Michael Collins, who was killed in an ambush at B√©al na mBl√°th, while touring recently occupied territory in County Cork, on August 22, 1922. Arthur Griffith, the Free State president had also died of a brain hemorrhage ten days before, leaving the Free State government in the hands of W. T. Cosgrave and the Free State Army under the command of General Richard Mulcahy. For a brief period, the onset of guerrilla warfare and the deaths of the two foremost leaders of the Provisional Government threw the Free State into crisis. August and September 1922 saw widespread attacks on Free State forces in the territories they had occupied in the July‚ÄìAugust offensive, inflicting heavy casualties on them. In this period, the republicans also managed several relatively large-scale attacks on rural towns, involving several hundred fighters. Dundalk, for example was taken by Frank Aiken's Anti-Treaty unit in a raid on 14 August, Kenmare in Kerry in a similar operation on 9 September and Clifden in Galway on 29 October. There were also unsuccessful assaults on for example Bantry, Cork on 30 August and Killorglin in Kerry on 30 September in which the Republicans took significant casualties.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p223, 225 However, as winter set in the republicans found it increasingly difficult to sustain their campaign and casualty rates among National Army troops dropped rapidly. For instance, in County Sligo, 54 people died in the conflict of whom all but 8 had been killed by the end of September.Michael Farry, The Aftermath of Revolution, Sligo 1921-23 In October 1922, √âamon de Valera and the anti-treaty Teachta D√°la (TDs, Members of Parliament) set up their own \\"Republican government\\" in opposition to the Free State. However, by then the anti-treaty side held no significant territory and de Valera's \\"government\\" had no authority over the population. In any case, the IRA leaders paid no attention to it, seeing the Republican authority as vested in their own military leaders. The Free State gains the advantage In the autumn and winter of 1922, Free State forces broke up many of the larger Republican guerrilla units. In late September, for example, a sweep of northern County Sligo by Free State troops under Sean MacEoin successfully cornered the Anti-Treaty column which had been operating in the north of the county. Six of the column were killed and thirty captured, along with an armoured car. A similar sweep in Connemara in County Mayo in late November captured Anti-Treaty column commander Michael Kilroy and many of his fighters. December saw the capture of two separate Republican columns in the Meath/Kildare area.Meath History, 1922-1958 Execution in County Kildare Intelligence gathered by Free State forces also led to the capture on 5 August of over 100 Republican fighters in Dublin, who were attempting to destroy bridges leading into the city and on 4 November Ernie O'Malley, commander of Anti-Treaty forces in Dublin was captured when National Army troops discovered his safe house. Elsewhere Anti- Treaty units were forced by lack of supplies and safe-houses to disperse into smaller groups, typically of nine to ten men. An exception to this general rule was the activities of a column of Cork and Tipperary Anti-Treaty IRA fighters led by Tom Barry. In late December 1922, this group of around 100 men took a string of towns, first in Cork, then in Tipperary and finally Carrick- on-Suir, Thomastown and Mullinavat in County Kilkenny where the Free State troops surrendered and gave up their arms Meda Ryan Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter pp.186-187 However, even Barry's force was not capable of holding any of the places it had taken and by January 1923 it had dispersed due to lack of food and supplies. Despite these successes for the National Army, it took eight more months of intermittent warfare before the war was brought to an end. The war and the railways By late 1922 and early 1923, the Anti Treaty guerrillas' campaign had been reduced largely to acts of sabotage and destruction of public infrastructure such as roads and railways. This had been an aspect of the Anti-Treaty campaign since August 1922, when Liam Lynch had issued general orders to this effect, \\"Owing to the use of railways by the Free State HQ for the conveyance of troops and war material and for the purposes of army communication, the destruction of the railways under Free State control is an essential part of our military policy\\".Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.198 Not long afterwards the railway bridge at Mallow, linking Cork and Dublin, was blown up, severing rail communications between the cities. Lynch re-emphasised the order on December 29, 1922, leading to a concerted assault on the railways early in the new year. In January 1923 the Great Southern and Western Railway released a report detailing the damage Anti-Treaty forces had caused to their property over the previous six months; 375 miles of line damaged, 42 engines derailed, 51 over-bridges and 207 under- bridges destroyed, 83 signal cabins and 13 other buildings destroyed. In the same month, Republicans destroyed the railway stations at Sligo, Ballybunnion and Listowel.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.199 In response, the Free State set up an Army Railway Corps in October 1922, specifically to protect its rail lines. A massive programme of building fortified blockhouses around railway lines was undertaken and as a result, most lines were open again by April 1923 but the lines connecting Dublin with Cork and Kerry remained out of action until after the war.Hopkinson p.200 While most of the attacks on the railways were assaults on property rather than people, in one case in Kerry, two railway workers were killed when republicans derailed their train.Tom Doyle, The Civil War in Kerry, p.250 Atrocities and executions Memorial to the Republican soldiers executed by Free State forces at Ballyseedy, County Kerry, designed by Yann Goulet The final phase of the Civil War degenerated into a series of atrocities that left a lasting legacy of bitterness in Irish politics. The Free State began executing Republican prisoners on 17 November 1922, when five IRA men were shot by firing squad. They were followed on 24 November by the execution of acclaimed author and treaty negotiator Erskine Childers. In all, the Free State sanctioned 77 official executions of anti- treaty prisoners during the Civil War. The Anti-Treaty IRA in reprisal assassinated TD Se√°n Hales. On 7 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four prominent Republicans (one from each province), who had been held since the first week of the war‚ÄîRory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey ‚Äî were executed in revenge for the killing of Hales. In addition, Free State troops, particularly in County Kerry, where the guerrilla campaign was most bitter, began the summary execution of captured anti-treaty fighters. The most notorious example of this occurred at Ballyseedy, where nine Republican prisoners were tied to a landmine, which was detonated, killing eight and only leaving one, Stephen Fuller, who was blown clear by the blast, to escape.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p241 The number of \\"unauthorised\\" executions of Republican prisoners during the war has been put as high as 153.Todd Andrews, Dublin Made Me, p.269 Among the Republican reprisals were the assassination of Kevin O'Higgins' father and W T Cosgrave's uncle in February 1923.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.191 It was also in this period that the Anti-Treaty IRA began burning the homes of Free State Senators and of many of the Anglo-Irish landed class. On 15 February 1923, Mansion of senator Brian Mahon in Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare was burned down by Anti- Treaty forces. In the remainder of the month, a total of 37 houses of senators were destroyed by the Anti-Treaty IRA. Their owners were mainly big landowners, descendants of the Protestant Ascendancy and many of them were unionists before Irish independence. Oliver St. John Gogarty was another prominent victim of house burnings. He also survived an assassination attempt in Dublin. End of the war By early 1923, the offensive capability of the IRA had been seriously eroded and when, in February, Republican leader Liam Deasy was captured by Free State forces, he called on the Republicans to end their campaign and reach an accommodation with the Free State. The State's executions of Anti-Treaty prisoners, 34 of whom were shot in January, also took its toll on the Republicans' morale. In addition, the National Army's operations in the field were slowly but steadily breaking up the remaining Republican concentrations. On 18 February, Anti-Treaty officer Dinny Lacey was killed and his column rounded up at the Glen of Aherlow in Tipperary. Lacey had been the head of the IRA's 2nd Southern Division and his death crippled the Republicans' cause in the Tipperary‚ÄìWaterford area.History of the Third Tipperary Brigade A meeting of the Anti-Treaty leadership on 26 February was told by their 1st Southern Division that, \\"in a short time we would not have a man left owing to the great number of arrests and casualties\\". The Cork units reported they had suffered 29 killed and an unknown number captured in recent actions and, \\"if five men are arrested in each area, we are finished.\\"Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p. 235‚Äì6 March and April saw this progressive dismemberment of Republican forces continue with the capture and sometimes killing of guerrilla columns. Among the more well known of these incidents was the wiping out of an Anti-Treaty IRA column under Tim Lyons (known as \\"Aeroplane\\") in a cave near Kerry Head on 18 April. Three anti- treaty IRA men and two National Army soldiers were killed in the siege of the cave and the remaining five Republicans were taken prisoner and later executed.Tom Doyle, The Civil War in Kerry, p. 300 A National Army report of 11 April stated, \\"Events of the last few days point to the beginning of the end as a far as the irregular campaign is concerned.\\"Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p? Republicans \\"dump arms\\" As the conflict petered out into a de facto victory for the pro-treaty side, √âamon de Valera asked the IRA leadership to call a ceasefire, but they refused. The IRA executive met on 26 March in County Tipperary to discuss the war's future. Tom Barry proposed a motion to end the war, but it was defeated by a vote of 6 to 5. de Valera was allowed to attend, after some debate, but was given no voting rights.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p. 237 Liam Lynch, the intransigent Republican leader, was killed in a skirmish in the Knockmealdown mountains in County Tipperary on 10 April. The National Army had extracted information from Republican prisoners in Dublin that the IRA Executive was in the area and, in addition to killing Lynch, they also captured senior officers Dan Breen, Todd Andrews, Se√°n Gaynor, and Frank Barrett in the operation. It is often suggested that the death of Lynch allowed the more pragmatic Frank Aiken, who took over as Chief of Staff, to call a halt to what seemed a futile struggle. Aiken's accession to leadership was followed on 30 April by the declaration of a ceasefire on behalf of the anti-treaty forces. On 24 May, Aiken issued an order to IRA volunteers to dump arms rather than surrender them or continue a fight which they were incapable of winning. De Valera supported the order, issuing a statement to anti-treaty fighters on 24 May: Thousands of anti- treaty IRA members (including de Valera on 15 August) were arrested by Free State forces in the weeks and months after the end of the war, when they had dumped their arms and returned home. Conclusion The guerrilla phase of the Civil War lasted roughly eight months. At first the Anti-Treaty, or republican, guerrillas were able to operate in large numbers and to mount relatively large-scale attacks. However their ability to do this was blunt ed by several factors - the onset of winter, the ongoing increase in size and competence of the National Army and their own lack of military and logistical supplies. All of these weaknesses were compounded by a lack of widespread public support. Whereas against the British in 1919-1921, the IRA had been able to rely on the passive support, at least, of most of the population, when fighting a native Irish government, this was no longer true. This was demonstrated in the elections immediately after the civil war, which Cumann na nGaedheal, the Free State party, won easily. (See 1923 Irish general election for the results.) They also faced hostility from the Press and the Catholic Church, which condemned their campaign as a system of murder and assassination of the National forces without any legitimate authority... the guerrilla warfare now being carried on [by] the Irregulars is without moral sanction and therefore the killing of National soldiers is murder before God, the seizing of public and private property is robbery, the breaking of roads, bridges and railways is criminal. All who in contravention of this teaching, participate in such crimes are guilty of grievous sins and may not be absolved in Confession nor admitted to the Holy Communion if they persist in such evil courses.Tim Pat Coogan, De Valera, p.344) As the war dragged on, the Republicans' capacity to undertake large-scale military operations became more and more restricted. A great deal of their activities were devoted to destruction of government property and infrastructure. At the same time, the cycle of executions and reprisals that marked the guerrilla war meant that it left far more bitterness among the combatants than the conventional phase of the war. Although the war ended with the defeat of the Anti-Treaty side, there was no negotiated peace. The remaining Republican guerrillas simply hid their arms and went home. This failure to end the war conclusively - either by military means or negotiation - meant that the Anti-Treaty IRA and its successors never fully accepted the 1922 Treaty settlement. This factor contributed to further campaigns by the IRA in the 1940s, 50s and later in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

It was sometimes abbreviated Agr., or occasionally Agripp.; both forms are found in the Fasti Capitolini.Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum i. Despite ending in -a, it is a masculine name. The feminine form was probably Agrippina, which is also found as a cognomen, or surname, but no examples of its use as a praenomen have survived. The praenomen Agrippa was regularly used by two patrician gentes, gens Furia and gens Menenia, who held several consulships during the early Republic. It was also the name of one of the legendary kings of Alba Longa, Agrippa Silvius, whose descendants came to Rome following the destruction of that city during the reign of Tullus Hostilius.Marcus Terentius Varro, quoted in De Praenominibus (epitome by Julius Paris)Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, books I-V Although the name is not known to have been used as a praenomen by any other gentes, it appeared as a cognomen in several families, including the Asinii, Fonteii, Haterii, Julii, and Vipsanii. Each of these families may once have used Agrippa as a praenomen. As a cognomen, the name survived into Imperial times. With the gradual abandonment of the Roman nomenclature system, Agrippa once again became a personal name, surviving into modern times.Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & MythologyGeorge Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897) Origin and meaning of the name Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro listed Agrippa as one of several archaic praenomina that had passed out of use by the 1st century BC. At least according to legend, it was used in pre-Roman times, and it appears as a praenomen in the earliest years of the Republic. The meaning of the name is unknown. Gaius Plinius Secundus speculated that it was originally used for a child who was born feet-first (a breech birth). However, this is probably a false etymology.Marcus Terentius Varro, quoted in De Praenominibus (epitome by Julius Paris)Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, books I-VGeorge Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897) In The Origin of Roman Praenomina, George Davis Chase, following August Fick's work on Greek personal names, speculated that the name was derived from Greek, and that it entered Latin via contact with Magna Graecia. However, Chase notes that the name does not appear in Greek sources, and concludes that the Italians must have changed the stem to conform to the pattern of Italic names.George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol.

Early years Palm was born 28 August 1910 in Frankfurt/Main, in a house that was located near today's Suhrkamp house. He is the only survivor of the Holocaust from his family, his relatives having been murdered by the Nazi regime. Palm studied archaeology at the University of Heidelberg, where he met a fellow student who would become his wife, Hilde L√∂wenstein (later known as Hilde Palm, and since 1959 as Hilde Domin). Exile Particularly receptive to the malicious developments taking place in Nazi Germany, the couple fled to Italy in 1932 to escape the growing anti- Semitism. They married in 1936, and lived first in Florence and then in Rome. Because of the rapprochement between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, Hitler‚Äôs visit to Rome, and the acrimonious atmosphere of fascist Italy, the pair once again emigrated in 1939, this time to England. Santo Domingo However, their fears of the Nazi menace did not wane, and the couple tried frenetically to emigrate across the Atlantic. None of their preferred choices‚Äîthe United States, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil‚Äîgranted them a visa, while some charged them exorbitant sums of money which they didn't have. The only country to unconditionally welcome them was the Dominican Republic. There, they arrived in the port of San Pedro de Macor√≠s in the summer of 1940. In Santo Domingo‚Äîwhere they lived for 14 years‚ÄîPalm worked as a historian and lecturer at the University of Santo Domingo, while his wife Hilde became a photographer of architecture. (She would later on become a writer, adopting the name Hilde Domin in 1959, in honor of the city which gave her refuge.) He quickly became established as one of the leading experts in his field, and elevated the population‚Äôs pride in their history to an academic standard. In 1950, he masterminded and curated a pivotal exhibit of Colonial Art that for the first time gathered and interpreted the limited artifacts still remaining from the period when Santo Domingo was the capital of the New World. He properly catalogued the treasures of America‚Äôs oldest cathedral (Catedral de Santa Mar√≠a la Menor, est 1536), as well as many artifacts from private collections. This exhibit was influential in developing a collective consciousness among Dominicans in regards to their Spanish past. It helped spark a hitherto unseen interest in colonial architecture that among other things, led to the revalorization and subsequent restoration of the old city district. Palm‚Äôs meticulous research on the Ciudad Colonial (Colonial City) of Santo Domingo‚Äî Europe's oldest American city, established in 1502‚Äîculminated in his seminal work ‚ÄúLos monumentos arquitect√≥nicos de la Espa√±ola, con una introducci√≥n a Am√©rica‚Äù (The Architectural Monuments of Hispaniola, with an Introduction to America, University of Santo Domingo Press, 1955) an in-depth analysis of the pioneering art and architecture of this historical city. His wife Hilde took the accompanying photographs. Their work was instrumental in securing the Government‚Äôs bid before UNESCO which granted World Heritage Site status to the entire Old City of Santo Domingo in 1990. Return to Germany The Palms returned to Germany in 1954, first settling in Frankfurt/Main, then in Heidelberg, where he was appointed lecturer of Spanish American Art and Culture at the University of Heidelberg in 1960. He remained there until his retirement. Palm excelled as a professor in his chosen area of Pre-Columbian, Portuguese and Spanish colonial art. He continued his special bond with Santo Domingo, publishing ‚ÄúArquitectura y Arte Colonial en Santo Domingo (Architecture and Colonial Art in Santo Domingo, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo) in 1978. He was among other things a member of the Academia Mexicana de las Artes. In 1988 he was distinguished by the University of Augsburg with the university price for Spain and Latin American studies. As a writer, Palm wrote poetry and also edited and translated Spanish American poetry into German. His anthology ‚ÄúRose aus Asche. Spanische und Spanisch-Amerikanische Lyrik seit 1900‚Äù (Rose from Ashes. Spanish and Spanish American Poetry since 1900) ranks among its most well known books. His lifelong predilection for his years in Santo Domingo are evident in his choice of poets: out of 12 poets form Latin America, including famous ones like Gabriela Mistral (Chile), C√©sar Vallejo (Peru), and Jos√© Lezama Lima (Cuba), Palm included two Dominican poets: Moreno Jim√©nes (Dominican Republic) and H√©ctor Inch√°ustegui Cabral. Erwin Walter palm died on 7 July 1988 in Heidelberg. He is celebrated in the Dominican Republic for his achievements in advancing scholarly research of the history and architecture of the early colonial period. In Santo Domingo, the Fundaci√≥n Palm‚Äîwhose mission is to study and promote Dominican patrimony, especially architecture, urbanism, and literature‚Äîwas established in his honor. In Germany, he served as a bridge, introducing Germans to Iberian American and Spanish art, architecture, and literature.

Illyria is a traditional adaption of Twelfth Night, but features a more contemporary score. Illyria began as Prospect Theater Company's musical production of Twelfth Night in Central Park in 2001. The company's artistic director Cara Reichel and resident writer Pete Mills then collaborated to create a complete musical adaption. The musical premiered from April 12 through the 28th at the Hudson Guild Theater, New York City. Plot Act I Feste, a jester, welcomes the audience and introduces them to the world of Illyria and each character featured in the show (‚ÄúPrologue‚Äù). In the midst of his introductions, an intense thunderstorm shipwrecks the twins Viola and Sebastian off of Illyria‚Äôs coast. Viola is able to make it to shore, but is unable to find her brother, and assumes he is dead. She decides to take on his identity, reasoning that it would be safer to be a man in an unfamiliar place. Dressed as Sebastian, Viola begins to work as a servant for Orsino, a Duke who is in love with the Countess Olivia. Orsino sends Viola to ask for Olivia‚Äôs hand, but Viola soon realizes she has feelings for Orsino. Meanwhile, Feste returns to Olivia‚Äôs home after spending several years away. He is surprised that Olivia is still mourning for her brother (and Feste‚Äôs former master), and takes it upon himself to bring joy back into the household. He lightheartedly mocks Maria about her love for Sir Toby, and brings back an old rivalry with the steward Malvolio. Feste‚Äôs efforts to cheer up Olivia work, and she agrees to receive a visitor, Viola. The Countess is quite taken with her, and as Viola leaves to report back to Orsino, Malvolio gives her a gift from Olivia, a ring. It is revealed that Sebastian has survived the shipwreck, and he enters Illyria with Antonio, the man who rescued him. At Olivia‚Äôs house, Feste, Toby, Andre, and Maria are all annoyed with Malvolio after he gets them in trouble. The four work together to create a plan for revenge. At the Duke‚Äôs palace, Viola and Orsino have a conversation on love. Viola realizes how much she cares for him, but knows she must wait until she can safely reveal her true identity before the two can be together (‚ÄúPatience‚Äù). However, the next morning Orsino discovers the ring that Olivia gifted Viola, and he yet again sends Viola to her home. Meanwhile, the revenge plan is set in motion as Maria writes a ‚Äúsecret admirer‚Äù letter to Malvolio, written to seem as though Olivia sent it. The letter tells Malvolio to dress and act in a ridiculous way in order to prove he loves Olivia back (‚ÄúThe Love Letter‚Äù). Viola, yet again with Olivia, realizes that the Countess has fallen in love with her instead of Orsino. The act closes as Viola, Olivia, and Orsino worry about their seemingly hopeless situations (‚ÄúSave One‚Äù). Act II The second act begins with Maria‚Äôs revenge plan working: Malvolio clumsily flirts with Olivia while dressed in ridiculous yellow socks (‚ÄúMalvolio‚Äôs Tango‚Äù). Olivia assumes he has gone mad, and has Sir Toby take him away. The real Sebastian makes it to the Duke‚Äôs palace, and the Duke, assuming that he is Viola, declares his love. Sebastian panics and flees to Olivia‚Äôs house, where he is once again mistaken for Viola. Sebastian and Viola end up in an absurd duel with Sir Andrew, which was set up by Maria and Toby (‚ÄúThe Duel‚Äù). Olivia rescues Sebastian from the duel and professes her love. Sebastian is confused but accepts. Malvolio, now imprisoned, begs Feste to release him or at least deliver a message to the Countess. Eventually, through a wild musical sequence, Sebastian and Viola are reunited and all the misunderstandings are resolved. Orsino and Viola are together, Olivia and Sebastian are together, and Toby and Maria reunite as well. Feste and the full cast address the audience and say goodbye (‚ÄúFinale‚Äù).

He started playing the classical guitar at the age of ten in a musical environment based on traditional Spanish music and the Australian rock and pop scene of the 1970s. Lorenzo's interest in guitar increased around 1970 when he saw the Beatles perform on TV. When Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator, died and democracy was reinstalled in Spain, the family returned to Barcelona. For his 18th birthday, his parents allowed him to buy his first electric guitar, which was a Ibanez AS 200. In Barcelona he studied at the L'Aula de Musica del Conservatori Superior de M√∫sica del Liceu. As a composer he has received the commission by the UK national arts lottery in 1997 to compose the suite called The Immigrant, which premiered at the Paul McCartney Auditorium in Liverpool, England. Lorenzo's life changed after hearing the album Wired (Jeff Beck album), Blue Benson by George Benson, Four & More by Miles Davis. Soon after, he was captivated by Wes Montgomery's album Smokin' at the Half Note which was released in 1965 and by Paco de Lucia¬¥s Entre dos aguas (album). He cites Jeff Beck, George Benson, the Beatles, Miles Davis, and Wes Montgomery, Paco De Lucia as having the biggest impact on his music. When he was 18 he was selected as National Jazz Solista Finalist: Ibiza Jazz Festival (1989). He then decided to further pursue his studies and went to Boston, USA. In 1992 he graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston, having studied commercial arranging under the supervision of Grammy Award winner Robert Freedman.

Thomas Cary was the second son of Robert Cary (died 1540), lord of the manor of Clovelly in Devon. Career After education at the Inner Temple (1558), Cary became captain of the Devon militia by 1572, a Justice of the peace from c. 1579, and deputy lieutenant from 1587. He was Member of Parliament for Dartmouth in 1586, and for the county seat of Devon, 1588. He was treasurer- at-war to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex during his campaign in Ireland in 1599 and was appointed a Lord Justice in September 1599 (when Essex left the country) and again in 1603 (on the departure of Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy). In 1601 Cary was responsible for the introduction of a newly debased Irish coinage and was accused in the Exchequer of Pleas of enriching himself in the process. Although the case was prolonged for several years nothing was ultimately proven, which may explain the words free from all filthy fraud that are inscribed on Isaac Oliver's miniature portrait of him (illustrated above).

It is known as Darwin's beetle, Grant's stag beetle, or the Chilean stag beetle. Behavior The male's oversized jaws are crucial in its objective to secure a mate. It climbs trees, often climbing many meters, searching for a female. As it climbs and searches for females, it also seeks out other males in the vicinity. When two males meet, they fight. Males use their jaws in combat: they hook them under the opposite beetle's wings, pull up and throw their opponent to the ground (from 20 meters above, as they are in great trees most of the time). Charles Darwin collected the species in Chile during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, and, despite the enlarged mandibles of the males, he noted that the jaws were \\"not so strong as to produce pain to finger\\". Taxonomy and nomenclature Chiasognathus grantii is one of the seven species belonging to the genus Chiasognathus. It belongs to the subfamily Lucaninae, the largest subfamily in the stag beetle family Lucanidae. C. grantii is also known locally as ', ', and ' in Spanish and ' in the Mapuche language.

Males and female. Mounted specimenChiasognathus grantii is very variable in size and in the development of the jaws and exhibits a strong sexual dimorphism. Males can reach a length of including the mandibles, while females are much smaller, having a body length of . The upper mandibles of the males are very robust at the base, finely serrated and longer than the body itself. The eyes are small and the antennae have a whorl of hairs at the apex. The thorax is broad and the anterior and posterior margins are densely ciliated with short pale hairs. Elytrae are chestnut-brown, with slightly greenish iridescent tinges and finely granulated.James Francis Stephens A description of Chiasognathus grantii C. grantii is considered a rare and vulnerable species, with a high probability of extinction, mainly as a consequence of the global climate change. The adults of these beetles primarily feed on tree juices, while the larvae eat dead wood. Habitat Chiasognathus grantii lives in temperate/subantarctic Nothofagus forests.

Crichton itself is west of Pathhead and south of Scotland's capital city, Edinburgh. The church is reached by leaving the A68 road at the north end of Pathhead and turning on to the B6367 minor road at Crichton on a single track lane signposted Crichton Castle. Before reaching the castle car park, on the left, is the church, situated at .  Origins and Pre Reformation  The site may have been the location of an old Christian shrine and about 1440 William Crichton, 1st Lord Crichton, Lord Chancellor of Scotland started to build a church there. On 26 December 1449, William Crichton, 1st Lord Crichton opened the church \\"Out of thankfullness and gratitude to Almighty God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Kentigern and All Saints\\", with the consent of his son, James of Frendraucht and confirmed on the 29 December by James Kennedy, Bishop of St Andrews. Like many other collegiate churches, Crichton was built for the use of the local lord, and a provost, eight prebendaries, two choir boys and a sacrist were appointed to pray for the souls of the Crichton family. The provost was granted the tiends and tithes of the prebends, the Rectory of Crichton and the Temple lands appertaining to Crichton. The church was built in a Gothic and Romanesque cruciform style with a large central tower; the nave was used as the place of worship for the poor people. However the Crichton family supported the claimant Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, in the 15th century, fell out of favour with the Scottish Crown and the Crichton lands were forfeited. During the Scottish Reformation of 1560 the glass was taken from the windows, the floor converted back to earth and the medieval stone tracery destroyed. The chancel roof was still extant but the church was a ruin and considered unusable for services.  Post Reformation  By 1569 it was being used as the parish kirk (church) and a minister, Adam Johnston, was ordained to lead the service. By the 1580s, major restoration work began, though the nave was said to be ruinous, as it is to this day. In 1641, by an Act of Parliament, Crichton Church was declared to be the parish church for all time. Though there was more restoration and adaptation in 1729 it was considered to have been carried out \\"badly\\". More work in the 1820s helped to bring the old church back to life, but it was not until the end of the 19th century that the church was fully restored, by the Edinburgh architects Hardy & Wright. Stained glass windows made by the Edinburgh company Ballantine and Gardener, new oak pews and a pipe organ built by the Glasgow company Joseph Brook were installed. The Church of Scotland closed the church in 1992 and the Crichton Collegiate Church Trust acquired the property. The Trust restored the organ, stained glass windows, lighting and the tower.

Starting as a Collector of Customs for the Gold Coast, he then became a Treasurer of the Gold Coast and the Gambia. Moving on to colonial administration, he started as the Administrator for the Gambia, where he dealt with the aggression of the native king of Gambia. His next post was as Governor for the Lagos Colony where he negotiated treaties with the local chiefs which protected Christian missionaries and ending human sacrifies. He later served as the Governor for The Bahamas and Barbados and finally as the Governor for Trinidad and Tobago. Early life and Naval career Carter was born in Topsham, Devon in 1848.\\"Sir Gilbert Thomas Gilbert-Carter (1848‚Äì1927)\\" by Bob Maddocks in Cameo, Journal of the West Africa Study Circle, Vol. 13, No. 2, June 2012, p. 117.

Carter joined the Royal Navy in 1864, serving as an Assistant Clerk on , being transferred in 1866 to . On 5 July 1866, Carter was promoted to Clerk, while still serving on HMS Malacca. Between 1867 and 1869, he served on a variety of ships as a clerk, until 1 December 1869 (while serving on ), when he was promoted to Assistant Paymaster (being added to the Navy List). Following a posting to for the first nine months of 1870, Carter's final posting was to the Colonial steamer Sherbro from August 1870. During his time on Sherbro, he was involved with the Third Anglo‚ÄìAshanto War on the Gold Coast. When Elmina was sold to the British by the Dutch Government, he was a commissioner, responsible for valuing the stores and ordnance left behind by the Dutch. He married Susan Laura Hocker, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Hocker, in 1874 (later having 3 sons and 2 daughters ‚Äî his second son Humphrey 1884‚Äì1969 was the first Director of the Cambridge University Botanic Garden). Lady Carter died in 1895. He retired from the Navy on 21 July 1875. Leeward Islands, the Gold Coast and the Gambia Carter became the private secretary to Sir George Berkeley, Governor of the Leeward Islands, in 1875. In August 1879, he was appointed Collector of Customs and Treasurer of the Gold Coast, an appointment he kept until 1882. From 1882 until December 1888, Carter administered the Settlement on the Gambia as a Treasurer and Postmaster. From 1886, he was acting Administrator of the Colony of the Gambia, and on 1 December 1888 he was appointed Administrator on that colony's separation from Sierra Leone. While working in the Gambia, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 1 January 1890. Illustration of Carter meeting with Musa Molloh, Prince of Fehrdoo, in 1889. In 1891, the native King of Gambia had been organising abusive acts towards the British colonists. Carter (from his official residence in Bathurst) sent an envoy with a message that if the abuses continued, \\"he might expect a visit of a disciplinary nature from the marine forces of the Queen of England.\\" The King sent the envoy back mutilated, with a message: \\"This is the King's answer.\\" In response, Carter sent three British gunboats to avenge the outrage upon the envoy. Lagos (Nigeria) Carter was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony of Lagos on 3 February 1891. Carter ordered an attack on the Ijebu \\"in the interest of civilization\\" in 1892. Afterwards, he continued to justify this attack as a war to end slavery and promote civilization. Carter travelled to various parts of Yorubaland, accompanied by soldiers, in an attempt to demonstrate the might of the British. Carter was not well received at Oyo, and the Egba chiefs advised him not to interfere with slavery, while the Ibadan chiefs said they were afraid that their slaves would \\"assert their freedom by running to the Resident\\" ‚Äì and they refused to sign a treaty with Carter that would impose a Resident on the city. However, in January 1893 the Egba chiefs signed a Treaty of Independence with the British Government. It was agreed that freedom of trade between the Egba Nation and Lagos was to be guaranteed by the British Government, in return for which no road would be closed without the approval of the Governor. They further agreed that complete protection and \\"every assistance and encouragement\\" would be afforded to all Christian ministers. The Crown agreed that \\"no annexation on any portion of Egba Nation shall be made by her Majesty's Government without the consent of the lawful authorities of the nation, no aggressive action shall be taken against the said nation and its independence shall be fully recognized.\\" The Egba chiefs further promised to abolish human sacrifices. He was promoted Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 3 June 1893, \\"in recognition of his services in conducting a mission to the Yoruba country which resulted in the negotiation of important treaties and brought to an end a long-standing war.\\" Carter was given Ife works of art in 1896 by the recently crowned King of Ife, Adelekan, in the hopes that a decision in his favour would be made about the resettlement of Modakeke residents outside the city. These works (including three known as the Ife marbles), were sent by Carter to Europe. While serving in Lagos, Lady Carter, his first wife, died on 13 January 1895, shortly after arriving in Lagos. The Carter Bridge, first built in 1901 and linking Lagos Island with Iddo Island, was named after him.

While being attacked by various villains from different alternate timelines, members from the dual Legions are confronted by their two greatest enemies: Mordru and Glorith. The couple disappears with Rokk Krin. Dawnstar is about to begin tracking them, but she unexpectedly fades from existence. Part 2: Valor #22 The structural core connecting the domed cities of New Earth is on the verge of total collapse, and a second faction from the two Legions tries desperately to hold the artificial planet together. Valor struggles to remember the major details of his life, as portions of his memory keep shifting. Legion benefactor R. J. Brande devises a plan to bring the Earth from the pocket universe into the regular universe,The pocket universe is first mentioned in Superman vol. 2, #8 (August 1987). and settle the domes of New Earth there. Computo (Danielle Foccart) and Troy Stewart (the former Tyroc) use their respective powers to open a gigantic wormhole, permitting Valor, the SW6 Andromeda and Dev-Em to tow Earth from the pocket universe to the regular one. However, a matter-energy shift occurs, making the entire planetary core unstable and likely to explode. Before the group can take additional action, more Legionnaires fade from existence. Part 3: Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #60 Mordru and Glorith imprison Rokk Krin in the Castle Keep of Time on the planet Baaldur. They do not kill him, as Glorith has determined that he is a \\"child of destiny\\", and that killing him would unleash chaos throughout the timestream. Meanwhile, almost all the living past and present members of both Legions (except those on New Earth) gather on Winath to begin a search for Rokk, who is considered to be the heart of the Legion. Even as more Legionnaires vanish, Rond Vidar, the SW6 Invisible Kid and the two Brainiac 5s determine that the timestream is completely unraveling, and must be repaired within hours. Mordru and Glorith travel to Legion Headquarters on the planet Talus, and reach the team's Time Beacon. They use it to summon the Infinite Man, who is the living embodiment of the space-time continuum. Mordru and Glorith immediately attack, allowing them to absorb all of the Infinite Man's energies and dissolve him into nothingness. Meanwhile, on Baaldur, Rokk cannot escape the castle, but is able to flee into the Infinite Library, the archive of all chronal knowledge. Part 4: Legionnaires #18 Now possessing near-godlike power, Mordru and Glorith begin to remold reality, with themselves as supreme rulers of the known universe. The Legionnaires with mystical knowledge and powers (Mysa Nal, Projectra, Dragonmage and the two Dream Girls) begin channeling their energies into Devlin O'Ryan, who would then become a living power blast able to stop Mordru and Glorith. Just as they are ready to act, Devlin fades away, leaving the mystics with no focus for their magic. With more of their number vanishing each minute, the heroes fend off attacks by a group of evil doppelganger Legionnaires. Just before Mysa (the former White Witch) disappears, she calls upon the power of Amethyst and manages to reverse Mordru and Glorith's changes to the timeline. In the 20th century, the founding SW6 Legionnaires (Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl and Live Wire) emerge from a shattered Time Bubble high above the Earth. They are about to fall to their deaths when they are saved by Jo Nah, the former Ultra Boy.Jo Nah was searching for his true love, the presumed-dead Phantom Girl, whom he believed to be stranded in the 20th century as an amnesiac. He instead finds her cousin Enya Wazzo, who elects to remain in the past. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #59 (July 1994); L.E.G.I.O.N. '94 #68-70 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1994) An image of Superman then appears before them, seeking their aid to avert a great disaster.Metron (of the New Gods) and Kyle Rayner (last survivor of the Green Lantern Corps) use their powers to send the message to superheroes across the Earth in Zero Hour: Crisis in Time #4 (September 1994). In the Infinite Library ‚Äî where time stands still ‚Äî Rokk Krinn spends an untold length of time studying the volumes on the shelves, learning as much as possible about the secrets of time. Eventually, he notices a door that is slightly ajar. He walks through, and finds himself face-to-face with the Time Trapper. Part 5: Valor #23 The Time Trapper tells Rokk that ‚Äî despite his many battles with the Legion ‚Äî he has actually been attempting to save the 30th century all along from an impending cataclysm in time. As part of the plan, he used his power to split the Legion into two separate time tracks just before Ferro Lad's death,Ferro Lad was killed destroying the Sun-Eater in Adventure Comics #353 (February 1967). placing one group in time-stasis to be discovered later as the SW6 Legionnaires.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #24-25 (December 1991 ‚Äî January 1992) Eventually, the Trapper's attempts to protect time drove him mad, and created revisions to the timeline that allowed Mordru and Glorith to become galactic threats. Rokk, the Trapper explains, is the key to repairing everything. Rokk does not believe the Trapper... until he reveals his true face. The Legionnaires gain much-needed assistance when Superboy, the very inspiration for the team, suddenly appears. When Valor momentarily distracts Glorith, Superboy knocks her unconscious. The team then bathes Mordru in all of the floating chronal energy, overloading him and permitting Imra Ardeen Ranzz (the former Saturn Girl) to command him to teleport to the core of the planet ‚Äî where his claustrophobic fear of being buried underground will render him powerless. Mordru chooses the unstable pocket universe Earth. Valor then fades away, and ‚Äî after an inspirational speech ‚Äî so does Superboy. Part 6: Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #61 The remaining Legionnaires gather on Pocket Earth, where Jo Nah and the SW6 founders return from the 20th century. Rokk Krinn is then returned to the group by the Time Trapper, who reveals himself to be an older version of Rokk. The Legion listens as the two explain that Rokk was destined to become the Time Trapper and attempt in vain to prevent the catastrophe in time, and that the creation of the second Legion team has further weakened the timestream. Only the reunification of the adult Legion with their young SW6 counterparts can realign time. As a final gift, the Trapper reaches into time and restores the two versions of Tinya Wazzo, allowing Jo Nah to finally reunite with Phantom Girl.The adult Phantom Girl was killed by Glorith, as explained in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #2 (December 1989) and Annual #1 (1990). Most of the remaining Legionnaires reunite and fade into the timestream, leaving only the dual versions of the founders. Before departing, the Trapper assures them that their sacrifice will not be in vain. Pocket Earth begins to break apart, and the six Legionnaires ‚Äî the last remaining sentient beings in the cosmos ‚Äî join hands as all reality disappears, fading into a white void. Aftermath \\"End of an Era\\" is a tie- in to the Zero Hour: Crisis in Time miniseries, which attempted to resolve some of the inconsistencies in the timeline of the DC Universe. Thereafter, Legion continuity is completely rebooted, starting in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #0 (October 1994). Subsequently, a second reboot occurs in the final pages of Teen Titans/Legion Special (November 2004). Following the Infinite Crisis miniseries, much of the original Legion continuity is restored.The restoration of the original continuity is depicted in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" and \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story arcs. However, \\"End of an Era\\" is not, and the story arc is no longer considered canonical. In his current incarnation, the Time Trapper is not Rokk Krinn, and his identity shifts with each divergent timeline.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009) He remains one of the Legion's principal enemies, with the complete removal of Superman from the timestream as one of his chief goals.Action Comics #864 (June 2008) Glorith, who originally appeared as one of the Trapper's underlings,Adventure Comics #338 (November 1965) is described by Mordru as one of \\"those that died by pain and torture by my hand!\\" Mordru reanimates her skeleton during a battle with the Legion, but the heroes promptly destroy it.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (November 2008) See also *Zero Hour: Crisis in Time References Comics by Kurt Busiek Comics by Mark Waid Legion of Super-Heroes storylines ","title":"End of an Era (comics)"},{"id":"25167763","text":"Chiasognathus is a genus of stag beetles found in Argentina and Chile.

He was of Jewish origin and was probably born in Pozna≈Ñ in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1498 he was taken captive aboard Vasco da Gama's fleet on its return voyage to Portugal from India. He was known to speak multiple languages including Hebrew and Chaldean, as well as a mixture of Italian and Spanish.  Biography   Before meeting the Portuguese  His original name is unknown. He appears with the name \\"Gaspar da Gama\\" or \\"Gaspar of the Indies\\" in the chronicles and reports of discovery written by Gaspar Correia, Fern√£o Lopes de Castanheda, Jer√≥nimo Os√≥rio, Dami√£o de G√≥is and √Ålvaro Velho but was known to Indians as Mahmet. Some sources confuse the latest with Gaspar de Lemos, a Portuguese sailor who commanded a ship in the fleet that discovered Brazil. Other sources also call him \\"Gaspar de Almeida\\" given his friendship with Francisco de Almeida, 1st Viceroy of India.Jewish Library. Gaspar da Gama (accessed 3 December 2008). There are several versions of his life before meeting Vasco da Gama in India.LIPINER, Elias. Gaspar da Gama: Um Converso na Frota de Cabral. Rio de Janeiro: Ed. Nova Fronteira apud CORDEIRO, H√©lio Daniel. Gaspar da Gama: um judeu no Descobrimento do Brasil. Revista Judaica, n. 63, abril/2003 (accessed 3 December 2008). Some of these were sourced at Gaspar da Gama himself, but he probably tried to hide some \\"inconvenient\\" facts about his own past. According to Gaspar's own account, he became a Jewish traveller, making his way to Jerusalem, and then Alexandria, where he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave in India, in India he secured his freedom in the service of the ruler of Goa. The chronicler Gaspar Correia states that, when found by the Portuguese, Gaspar da Gama was Captain of the fleet of Yusuf Adil Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur, Arab governor of Goa in India. Dami√£o de G√≥is says Gaspar da Gama was a Jew born in the city of Pozna≈Ñ in the Kingdom of Poland and that at that time he did not speak Spanish, but the Venetian language, the very language used in European based commercial centers in the East. Controversy The historian Jo√£o de Barros, reports that Gaspar da Gama informed him that his parents were from Bosna (or Posner, i.e., Poznan) in Poland. His parents migrated to Jerusalem and then to Alexandria, where Gaspar da Gama was born. The Israeli journalist Elias Lipiner, studied the documentation of the Portuguese chroniclers of the Age of Discovery and considered Jo√£o de Barros version as the most faithful to facts, suggesting that Gaspar da Gama must have been born in Alexandria (Egypt) around 1458. Following Jewish Radhanite trade routes at the time, he went very young to India where he established himself as a merchant. Other historians, such as the scholar of Brazilian Jewish history Arnold Wiznitzer, think he was born in Granada or circa 1440 in Bosnia (perhaps confusion with the name of Poznan).  Meeting the Portuguese  In 1498, when the returning Vasco da Gama fleet landed on the island of Angediva, about 20 miles off the coast of Goa, Gaspar da Gama, uninvited, went on the ship of Vasco da Gama and asked happily to go aboard, to visit his native Spain.MAGNO, Ana Beatriz. Torre de Babel. CorreioWeb - 500 Anos de Brasil. O vig√©simo nono dia da viagem (accessed 4 December 2008).Vasco Da Gama, Ernest George Ravenstein, \\"A journal of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama, 1497-1499\\", Asian Educational Services, 1995, He was then more than 50 years age, with white beard, with louder and clear manners than that of the Indians of region. As reported by √Ålvaro Velho, clerk of the Portuguese fleet, Gaspar da Gama said that he was \\"working for a powerful lord who owns an army of more than 40 thousand horsemen, and that upon hearing of their arrival he had asked to see them. If not he would have died of sadness.\\" Vasco da Gama pretended to believe, and discreetly sent men to Anjadip Island to get information about the visitor. Some reliable merchants told that he was a spy, preparing a surprise attack. Upon this, Vasco da Gama had the visitor whipped and interrogated under torture. After having hot oil dropped on his skin, Gaspar da Gama told he was a Jew from Granada who had converted to Christianity and after traveling to Turkey and Mecca went to the Indies, and that there was no plan to attack the Portuguese. After 12 days of interrogation, Vasco da Gama came to rely more on the prisoner. He gave him a cheese and two soft breads and Gaspar da Gama told him that, after all, he was very happy to find these \\"Franks\\". Vasco da Gama kept Gaspar as a prisoner and took him on the eventful trip back to Portugal, perhaps considering that his knowledge of the East would be useful. During the long return, Gaspar da Gama befriended the Portuguese, and especially Vasco da Gama. He was baptized the following year, Vasco da Gama being his godfather and giving him his own surname. The first name - Gaspar - had been chosen as a reference to its origins, being the name of one of three Magi from the East who visited Jesus.CORDEIRO, H√©lio Daniel. Gaspar da Gama: um judeu no Descobrimento do Brasil. Revista Judaica, n. 63, abril/2003 (accessed 3 December 2008). In Portugal and back to India King Manuel I of Portugal enjoyed Gaspar da Gama and called him frequently to the court, to hear his stories about the land and customs of the East. There was a suspicion that Gaspar da Gama was an Arabic spy, but the Portuguese recognized his value, because beside having traded in some of their centers in India, he spoke Latin, Arabic, Italian, Castilian, Portuguese and some languages of India. Because of this, the King Manuel I appointed him counselor and interpreter of the second fleet sailing to the Indies, led by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. Always with a cap on his head and dressed in white linen, Gaspar da Gama was one of the more exotic characters in the fleet of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. Although not the only linguist at the expedition that discovered the Brazil, he was the main interpreter in the trade negotiations between the Portuguese and Brazilian Indians, along with Gon√ßalo Madeira. Once in India, Gaspar da Gama fulfilled his mission with his interpreter services and knowledge of geopolitics and customs of India important in business meetings of Portuguese and Indian rajas in Calicut and Cochin. He returned on his own will to Portugal with Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. In 1501, the fleet met the expedition of Gaspar de Lemos appointed by the king of Portugal to explore the newly discovered lands of Brazil, near modern Dakar, Senegal. Talks between Gaspar da Gama and other members of the expedition with the Florentine Amerigo Vespucci who accompanied Gaspar de Lemos certainly strengthened the idea that the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were not the Indies, but a new continent. In 1502 Gaspar da Gama participated in another travel to India commanded by Vasco da Gama, and again in 1505 with the recently appointed viceroy Francisco de Almeida. During these trips, he learned a few African languages. He participated in the Indian expeditions of the Portuguese who tried to conquer Hormuz in 1508 and Calicut in 1510, when some assume that he died. Others believe that he returned to Portugal where he died. Some say that his death occurred between 1510 and 1515, or even by about 1520, with nearly eighty years. The change of Christian name \\"Terra de Santa Cruz\\" to \\"Brazil\\" is attributed by some to Gaspar da Gama and Fern√£o de Noronha, both being Jewish. However, this does not have an historical basis, being due to the intense trade in Brazilwood.

It was first created in 1964 and is hosted at the Institute for the German Language (IDS) in Mannheim, Germany. The corpus archive is continuously updated and expanded. It currently comprises more than 4.0 billion word tokens (as of August 2010) and constitutes the largest linguistically motivated collection of contemporary German texts. Today, it is one of the major resources worldwide for the study of written German. Alternative names The German Reference Corpus is often referred to by other names, such as Mannheim corpora, IDS corpora, COSMAS corpora and the corresponding German translations. The name Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo) was originally used for a specific portion of the current archive which was collected between 1999 and 2002 by a number of institutions in a joint project under the same name. Since 2004, Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo) is the official name of the full corpus archive. Conception and composition The German Reference Corpus comprises fictional and academic texts, a large number of newspaper texts and several other text types. The texts cover the time range from around 1950 to the present. In contrast to other well-known corpora and corpus archives (such as the British National Corpus), however, the German Reference Corpus is explicitly not designed as a balanced corpus: The distribution of DeReKo texts across time or text types does not match some predefined percentages. This conception complies with the fact that whether or not a given corpus constitutes a balanced or even representative language sample may only be assessed with respect to a specific language domain (i.e., the statistical population). Because different linguistic investigations generally aim at different language domains, the declared purpose of the German Reference Corpus is to serve as a versatile superordinate sample, or primordial sample (German: Ur-Stichprobe) of contemporary written German, from which corpus users may draw a specialised subsample (a so-called virtual corpus) to represent the language domain they wish to investigate. Access Due to copyright and licence restrictions, the DeReKo archive may not be copied nor offered for download. It can be queried and analyzed free of charge via the system COSMAS II - end-users are required to register by name and to agree to use the corpus data exclusively for non-commercial, academic purposes. COSMAS II enables users to compile from DeReKo a virtual corpus suitable for their specific research questions.

He has been a Philippine Senator and the president of the Nacionalista Party. Villar was born to a middle class family in Tondo, an impoverished and densely populated district of Manila. After graduating from the University of the Philippines, he worked as an accountant and financial analyst, then launched a highly successful business in real estate. Villar's companies have built over 200,000 homes, and his business career made him the wealthiest person in the Philippines. Villar entered politics in 1992 when he was elected congressman representing the district of Las Pi√±as-Muntinlupa, and later became Speaker of the House of Representatives. As Speaker, he presided over the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada by the House of Representatives in 2000. In 2001 he was elected Senator, and served as Senate President from 2006 to 2008. He was the candidate of the Nacionalista Party in the 2010 presidential election, which was won by Benigno Aquino III. Early life and education Manuel Bamba Villar Jr. was born on December 13, 1949 in Tondo, an impoverished and densely populated district of Manila. He was the second-born of the nine children of his parents in a poor family. His father, Manuel \\"Maning\\" Montalban Villar, Sr., was a government employee from Cabatuan, Iloilo who worked as an inspector for the Bureau of Fisheries. His mother, Curita \\"Curing\\" Bamba, was a seafood vendor from a poor family in Orani, Bataan. The family lived in a small rented apartment in a run down slum area. Villar's father was eventually granted a year-long scholarship for higher education in the United States, which led to a job promotion to a director position in the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources upon his return. Due to cramped conditions in Tondo, Villar's father obtained a P16,000 loan from the Government Service Insurance System, payable in 20 to 25 years, to build a home in San Rafael Village, Navotas. As a child, Villar initially attended Isabelo delos Reyes Elementary School, a nearby public school in Tondo. He also assisted his mother in selling shrimp and fish at the Divisoria Public Market, as early as age six, in order to help earn the money to support his siblings and himself to school. However, accompanying his mother interfered with his education and he was forced to drop out from school during Grade 1. He was then enrolled at Tondo Parochial School (later renamed Holy Child Catholic School), a private school in Tondo run by priests, to complete his elementary education. Villar finished his high school education at the Map√∫a Institute of Technology in Santa Cruz, adjacent to Tondo. He attended the University of the Philippines - Diliman and earned his bachelor's degree in business administration in 1970. He returned to the same school to earn his master's degree in business administration in 1973. He later characterized himself as being impatient with formal schooling, and eager to start working and go into business. Business career After obtaining his bachelor's degree, Villar began his professional career working as an accountant for Sycip, Gorres, Velayo & Co. (SGV & Co), the country's largest accounting firm. He resigned from SGV & Co. to start his first business, delivering seafood in Makati. However, when his largest customer was unable to pay him, he negotiated a debt restructuring of sorts, selling discounted meal tickets to office workers in exchange for receivables. He then worked briefly as a financial analyst for the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines, where his job was to sell World Bank loans. Wanting to start a business of his own again, he quit his job and availed of one of the loans, which offered attractive rates. In 1975, with an initial capital of ‚Ç±10,000, Villar purchased two reconditioned trucks and started a business delivering sand and gravel for construction companies in Las Pi√±as. This eventually segued into building houses, as Villar took out a seven-year loan from a rural bank offering low interest rates. From the loan, he kick-started building and selling homes at his first project, Camella Homes Phase 1 and 2 in Las Pi√±as, initially with 160 units and would have resulted to be the country's largest home building company, with an emphasis on low-priced mass housing. A notable innovation of Villar's companies was to sell house and lot packages, when the common practice at the time was to sell lots for future homeowners to build upon. He initiated mass housing projects through economies of scale, utilizing the cost advantages of developing a large-scale project in order to bring down housing prices. The number of homes built by Villar's companies totaled to over 200,000 units. In the 1980s, Villar established Prime Water to operate and maintain water distribution systems throughout the country. It counts a 25-year partnership with the municipality of Daraga to deliver bulk water, a 25-year joint venture agreement with Lingayen Water District in Pangasinan, and a 25-year joint agreement with the Leyte Metropolitan Water Districthttps://www.leytesamardailynews.com/villar-owned-prime-water-now- manages-lmwd/ among its 30 water projects with local water districts. The Commission on Audit flagged Prime Water‚Äôs operations in Guagua, Pampanga due to high levels of arsenic in the commission's 2018 annual report.https://politics.com.ph/unreasonable-inquiry-sought-on-prime-water- villars-78-water-rate-hike/ The company produces over 170 million liters of treated water daily, supplied by more than 250 deep wells and surface water resources, and is directly involved in delivering water to more than 150,000 households across the Philippines.http://manilastandard.net/business/154007/villar-joins-bulacan- water-auction.html Now under the Villar Group of companies, the water utility firm is led by their eldest son, Paolo.https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/12/10/duterte-not-endorsing-prime-water-to- take-over-concessions-villar/ In 1984, he founded Golden Haven Memorial Park, a chain of cemeteries in the Philippines, started with its first branch in Las Pinas and expanded in Cebu, Cagayan De Oro, Zamboanga, Bulacan, and Iloilo. It will also expanded into the businesses of memorial chapel, crematorium and columbarium. In July 1995, Villar's flagship property, C&P; Homes, was listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange and grew by more than a third in one day, ballooning Villar's 80% stake in the company to $1.5 billion. Villar had concentrated on low-cost housings which were bought by the home buyers themselves, giving opportunities for the low and middle-income Filipino families to acquire homes. He also wanted to set an example to Filipino entrepreneurs that what they set their mind on can be achieved. Vista Land and Lifescapes, Inc., a family-owned business of Villar, is also listed in the privately owned Philippine Stock Exchange. Their shares of stocks were bought primarily by foreign funds which had given the government, as well as the PSE, good revenues. Villar has received several awards for his achievements during his professional and business career, including being one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in 1986, the Agora Award for Marketing Management in 1989, Most Outstanding CPA by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in 1990, and Most Outstanding UP Alumnus in 1991. In 2004, he was named the Most Distinguished Alumnus, the highest recognition given by the University of the Philippines Alumni Association. As of September 2018, Forbes magazine ranks him as the 2nd-wealthiest person in the Philippines, with his net worth of US$5 billion or ‚Ç±269 billion (53.8 exchange rate). However, his statements of assets and liabilities (SALN) filed for the year 2012 states his net worth at P1.453 billion.http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/05/22/944873/villars- richest-chiz-poorest-senator In 2015, the MB Villar Group formed another company, Vitacare Healthgroup, Inc., a group that will build chain of hospitals nationwide. Its first project Vitacare Unimed Hospital & Medical Center (in partnership with Unimed) will be located in Vista City, Las Pinas will be fully operated in 2018. Manny Villar also ventured into coffee shop business, Coffee Project (formerly The Coffee Project) which has now 31 stores across the country.https://www.instagram.com/p/BpEIvaqHD36/ Becoming the richest person in the Philippines In 2019, Forbes Magazine named Villar as the new richest individual in the Philippines, with an estimated net worth of P250.68 Billion, taking the spot from the late Henry Sy, Sr. Political career House of Representatives He was elected to the House of Representatives, representing the district of Las Pi√±as-Muntinlupa. Due to congressional redistricting, he later represented the district of Las Pi√±as City. He served for three consecutive three-year terms, consistently posting landslide election victories. Villar was chosen Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1998, during his third term in congress. As speaker, he presided over the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada over corruption allegations in November 2000. Along with a large group of lawmakers which include the Senate President, Villar defected from Estrada's Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP) coalition in order to hasten the process of impeachment. Seconds after the opening prayer, and skipping the traditional roll call, he immediately read a resolution sending the impeachment case to the Senate for trial, bypassing a full vote and ignoring attempts by Estrada allies to delay the proceedings. Hours after the impeachment proceedings, congressmen allied with the president led a move to oust Villar from his post as speaker, replacing him with Camarines Sur representative Arnulfo Fuentebella, an ally of President Estrada. In 2001, barred by constitutional term limits from seeking re-election to a fourth term in the House of Representatives, Villar was succeeded by his wife, Cynthia Villar. Senate Villar ran for Senator in the 2001 election. Having recently resigned from Estrada's LAMMP coalition, he ran for Senator as an independent politician, but campaigned as a member of the People Power Coalition, the administration coalition party which was supportive of the recent 2001 EDSA Revolution. He was elected to the Senate with more than 11 million votes, ranking seventh out of 37 candidates. He later won re-election in 2007, running as a member of the Genuine Opposition coalition, ranking fourth out of 37 candidates. In July 2006, Villar was chosen Senate President, making him the first post-World War II public official to head both the House of Representatives and the Senate. He had previously held the position of Senate President pro tempore, as well as the chairmanship of the Committees on Finance, Foreign Relations, Public Order, and Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries. In November 2008, Villar lost the support of the Senate majority, due to alleged fabricated accusations thrown on him by political enemies on the C5 project. He then resigned as President of the Senate and was succeeded by Juan Ponce Enrile who later on investigated Villar for C5 scam. 2010 presidential campaign Villar was a candidate for President of the Philippines in the May 2010 presidential election, as the standard bearer of the Nacionalista Party. He filed his certificate of candidacy for president on November 30, 2009, along with his running mate, Senator Loren Legarda. His popular campaign line was \\"Sipag at Tyaga\\" (Hardwork and Patience). Villar's campaign platform includes combating poverty and corruption, two major problems between which he believes there is a strong link. According to a January 2010 survey by polling firm Pulse Asia and the February 2010 survey from Social Weather Stations, Villar was statistically tied in the lead with his main rival in the election, Senator Benigno Aquino III. In a March survey rival Aquino had regained a significant nine-point lead. Other significant rivals in the presidential race included former President Joseph Estrada and former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro. During the presidential campaign, opinion columnist William Esposo claimed that Villar has lied in his TV ads and could not have been poor because his younger brother Danny was admitted to FEU Hospital, which he claims was a top hospital at the time and in 1962, there was no bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy yet and everyone whether rich or poor died from contracting leukemia. Villar clarified that his brother was admitted as a charity patient, because the family was unable to afford treatment. Any family member, who is on the verge of death, will definitely be brought to the nearest possible hospital to try and save him, regardless of their status in life. Villar placed third in the election, behind Senator Noynoy Aquino and former President Joseph Estrada. On May 11, 2010, a day after the election, Villar was among the first to concede to Aquino. Offshore leaks During the ICIJ's (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) report of Offshore leaks in April 2013, his name appeared on the list of businessmen with offshore accounts. It was revealed that Villar owned an account in the British Virgin Islands. \\"The ICIJ investigation, of which PCIJ was part, found that Villar is the beneficial owner of a BVI international business corporation called Awesome Dragon Holdings Limited,\\" said an ABS-CBN article. https://news.abs- cbn.com/nation/04/05/13/manny-villar-jv-ejercito-linked-offshore-accounts Villar has not denied ownership of Awesome Dragon, and no evidence of any wrongdoing has been found. Personal life In his third year of college at the University of the Philippines, Villar became friends with Cynthia Aguilar, his classmate in the UP College of Business Administration. Her father was then mayor of Las Pi√±as City. They married at the age of 25. They have three children: Paolo (born c. 1977), eldest child and first of two sons; Mark (born 1978); second of two sons; and Camille Linda (born c. 1985), youngest child and only daughter. Villar's two sons studied at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for their college education, while Camille attended Ateneo de Manila University for her undergraduate degree and IESE Business School for her MBA in 2013. All three children graduated with degrees in finance or business management. Mark is a former Representative of Las Pi√±as City and the current DPWH secretary, while Camille is the current Representative of Las Pi√±as City and a former co-host of Wil Time Bigtime and Wowowillie. Villar lives in a two-bedroom house with his family in Las Pi√±as City. In early 2010, a political smear was disseminated on the Internet, claiming falsely that Villar owned an extravagant mansion in the United States, which was debunked by Snopes.com.

Establishing the Anglican Church on the Diamond Fields The first visit by an Anglican priest to the Diamond Fields, in 1870, came from the Free State when the Revd Charles Clulee, born in 1837 Birmingham, England, spent part of a winter holiday there from Bloemfontein. Revd. Clulee was head of the Grammar School in Bloemfontein, and ran the diocesan \\"Native Mission\\". Ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Diamond Fields ‚Äì which, like the Diocese of Bloemfontein as a whole, lay beyond the Queen‚Äôs dominions ‚Äì was first officially extended with the arrival of Archdeacon Henry Kitton from Grahamstown in November 1870. He was temporarily appointed by the bishop of Grahamstown (acting as metropolitan bishop) \\"to the pastoral charge of the whole district on both sides of the river.\\" Anglican services and rites were to be performed only by the archdeacon or clergymen he had authorized ‚Äì until permanent arrangements were made.Pressly, G.N. 1971.

Within a month, \\"Church of England Services\\" were being advertised and held at Pniel, \\"in the new church tent\\"; in the Music Hall at Klipdrift (afterwards called Barkly West); and also at Good Hope. Moving swiftly to consolidate an Anglican presence, Kitton convened a meeting of the English Church Committee in December 1870. R.W. Murray, accepting office as secretary, advocated the erection of a church building and in February 1871 the British High Commissioner Sir Henry Barkly, during his visit, laid the foundation stone. It was also in February 1871 that the Revd Henry Sadler arrived via Bloemfontein, and was referred to as \\"Chaplain to the Fields\\", within the Diocese of Bloemfontein. Sadler had been recruited in England during Bishop Robert Gray‚Äôs recent visit there.Gray, C. 1876. Life of Robert Gray. London: Rivingtons He saw to the completion of the church building. St Mary the Virgin, Barkly West, was dedicated in November 1872, with Fr E. Stenson as first rector. It held its place as the first and principal parish at this western edge of the Diocese of Bloemfontein until gradually other parishes ‚Äì such as those in Kimberley ‚Äì could stand on their own (having initially been chapelries administered from Barkly). When eventually in 1911 the Bishops of the Church of the Province of South Africa agreed to the formation of a separate Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman, Kimberley, soon to be officially a city, had for long eclipsed Barkly West in size and importance, both civil and ecclesiastical.

The name Kengy≈ç is an honorary title given to highly skilled blind musicians. Yatsuhashi, who was born and died in Japan, was originally a player of the shamisen, but later learned the koto from a musician of the Japanese court. While the instrument was originally restricted to the court, Yatsuhashi is credited as the first musician to introduce and teach the koto to general audiences. He is thus known as the \\"Father of Modern Koto.\\" He changed the limited selection of six pieces to a brand new style of koto music which he called kumi uta. Yatsuhashi changed the Tsukushi goto tunings, which were based on tunings used in gagaku, and with this change a new style of koto was born. He adapted the Hirajoshi scale and the Insen scale for the koto, from the shamisen repertoire. Yatsuhashi is also credited as the composer of the important koto solo piece Rokudan-no-shirabe (ÂÖ≠ÊÆµ„ÅÆË™ø, Music of Six Steps), although he may not actually have composed it himself.

His victory over the sitting Liberal Party MP Arthur Crosfield was a narrow one, but at the post-war general election in December 1918, Smith received the coalition coupon and was re-elected with a large majority. He was knighted in the 1921 New Year Honours. At the 1922 general election, he did not stand again in Warrington, where he was succeeded as MP by another Conservative, Alec Cunningham-Reid who had been a flying ace in World War I. Smith stood instead in Liverpool Wavertree, a safe Conservative seat which returned him to the House of Commons with a large majority. However, at the December 1923 general election, he lost the seat with a massive swing to the Liberal Party candidate Hugh Rathbone. Personal life Smith married Beatrice Furneaux, the sister of Margaret Furneaux,http://www.geni.com/people/Joan- Smith/6000000017973628734http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp- content/uploads/2011/11/Birkenhead.pdf his brother FE's wife, in London in September 1914.http://rogerthompson.com/Family%20tree/fam558.html The couple had one child, Harold Anthony Warrington Smith, (known as Anthony), who later died at the age of 26 on 4 August 1944 when his jeep ran over a mine during the Battle of Florence.

The act addresses media policy issues related to digital media, including copyright infringement, Internet domain names, Channel 4 media content, local radio and video games. Introduced to Parliament by Lord Mandelson on 20 November 2009, it received Royal Assent on 8 April 2010. It came into force two months later, with some exceptions: several sections ‚Äì 5, 6, 7, 15, 16(1)and 30 to 32 ‚Äì came into force immediately, whilst others required a statutory instrument before they would come into force. However some provisions have never come into force since the required statutory instruments were never passed by Parliament and considered to be \\"shelved\\" by 2014, and other sections were repealed.  Provisions   Online infringement of copyright provisions (sections 3‚Äì16)  Sections 3 to 16 contained copyright infringement provisions, which were controversial. These provisions established a \\"code\\" to be created which would define a system of procedures covering notifications to Internet Service Providers to notify their customers when an allegation was made of downloading copyright- infringing content online, subscriber appeals, conditions under which subscribers could be identified to third parties, and conditions for disconnecting persistent infringers. The objective was to provide evidence that copyright holders could use in court action against subscribers who repeatedly infringed. A second element of the provisions comprises the ‚Äòtechnical measures‚Äô, where a sanction would be applied directly via a subscriber's Internet provider. Under DEA Section 3 the allegations were to be transmitted to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by the copyright holders. The ISPs would then be obliged to transmit notifications to their subscribers, informing them of the allegation. DEA Section 4 mandated the ISPs to keep a list of repeat offenders (a \\"copyright infringement list\\" ) who had reached a pre-determined threshold in terms of the number of infringements committed, and the data should be anonymous. The aim is that copyright holders could later seek a court order to identify subscribers against whom they want to take action. = Code not passed into law = The Act provided for this in the form of an Enabling Act, which required Ofcom (the communications regulator for the UK) to produce a draft Code that would then be passed by Parliament and come into force as a Statutory Instrument. However, by 2013, when the draft code was produced, the political climate had changed and a substantial controversy existed over the practicalities of the proposed Code. The draft code to create the Code was never passed into law or pursued after that date, and was \\"shelved\\" by 2014. = Outline of Code provisions = The Code had comprised the following components: ;Initial obligations code The act does not specify the implementation detail for the measures. Instead, provides for the implementation to be drafted by Ofcom, in an Initial Obligations Code. Section 5 and Section 6 establish the process for Ofcom to write the code. Section 7 establishes in a very broad way what the code should contain, but leaves all the detail for Ofcom. The code must be approved by Parliament under the annulment procedure before it can come into force. The decision to use the code of practice instead of specifying the measures in full within the text of the act has itself formed part of the controversy surrounding the measures. For example, the act did not specify the standard of evidence required. It also did not specify the threshold ‚Äì number of infringements ‚Äì for entry onto the copyright infringement list. On 28 May 2010 Ofcom published a draft initial obligations code for consultation. In June 2012, it issued a second consultation document ; Obligations to limit Internet access (technical measures) After the Initial Obligations Code has been in force for one year, the act provides for a second set of measures to be brought in. The technical measures specified in the act Section 9 are the restriction or limitation of the speed of the broadband connection, restricting access to particular material online, and suspension (disconnection) of the service. The most controversial of them however, was disconnection of the subscriber for a period of time. It would function as an alternative to taking people to court, and in effect an extrajudicial process. Technical measures are to be brought in under another code, known as the code about obligations to limit Internet access Section 11 and Section 12. This Code would be subject to the super- affirmative procedure in the British Parliament. ; Appeals Section 13 of the act requires the provision of an independent appeals process, so that subscribers who wish to do so, may challenge a notification or (when implemented) a technical measure. Ofcom is required to set up an appeals body. This body will be an administrative body, independent of copyright holders and ISPs. Cases will not be heard in person. If technical measures are implemented, there will be a right to appeal to a First Tier Tribunal. ; Obligations on ISPs and copyright holders The act amends the Communications Act 2003. In this context, it places obligations on the ISP to apply both of the codes, and it gives Ofcom the responsibility of enforcing those obligations. Ofcom has the power to fine the ISPs up to ¬£250,000 if they fail to meet those obligations. Section 14 The act also provides for the cost allocation to be determined by a further statutory instrument. Section 15. To date, two draft statutory instruments have been laid before Parliament but neither has been passed into law.  Blocking Internet locations (sections 17‚Äì18)  : This section of the act has been repealed. Section 17 and 18 would have allowed copyright holders to apply to a court to obtain website blocking injunctions where \\"a substantial amount of material has been, is being or is likely to be made available in infringement of copyright\\", or where a location \\"facilitates\\" such behaviour. In deciding whether to grant an injunction, the court would have been required to consider: * Steps taken by the operator of the location to prevent infringement * Steps taken by the copyright owner to facilitate lawful access to the material * Any representations made by a Minister of the Crown * Whether the injunction would be likely to have a disproportionate effect on any person's legitimate interests * The importance of freedom of expression Sections 17 and 18 would have had to be brought into force by a statutory instrument. However, following a review by Ofcom, they were repealed on the basis that copyright holders already had the ability to use Section 97 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act to take court action against websites.  Other provisions  Other provisions in the act include * Section 42 an amendment to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to increase the penalty in connection with criminal liability for copyright and performing rights to a maximum of ¬£50,000. * Age classification of content is also in the act, which adopts the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) standard for video game ratings, and transferring content rating from the British Board of Film Classification to the Video Standards Council. * Changes to DAB radio in the United Kingdom including the reorganisation and merging of some of the local DAB ensembles and a requirement for a digital switchover of terrestrial radio in the United Kingdom. * The management of \`.uk\` Internet domain registries * The functions of the Channel Four Television Corporation * The regulation of television and radio services * The regulation of the use of the electromagnetic spectrum * The Video Recordings Act 1984 * Public lending right in relation to electronic publications. (Authors receive a 10p royalty for physical books lent from UK libraries but not ebooks. This act extends that royalty to cover some ebooks and audio books lent by libraries electronically. However the appropriate legislation has not yet been amended for this to take place.)  Legislative process  The Digital Economy Act followed the Digital Britain report of 2009,Digital Britain final report a policy document which outlined the United Kingdom Government's strategic vision for its digital economy. Lord Carter, Digital Britain minister, spent eight months considering the matter before releasing his final report in June 2009. The Digital Economy Bill was announced in the Queen's Speech on 18 November 2009 to the United Kingdom parliament. The bill went through three readings in the House of Lords, before being presented to the House of Commons for its first reading on 16 March 2010.  Wash-up  The general election was called on 6 April 2010, which meant that the Digital Economy Act was running out of Parliamentary time, as Parliament was dissolved on 8 April. The Digital Economy Bill went into what is called wash-up.A Copyright Masquerade: How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms ZedBooks, pp248-265, uses Hansard to put together an account of the wash-up The wash-up is an accelerated parliamentary process used after general elections have been called to rush unopposed legislation through parliament before dissolution. This meant it was not debated at length in the Commons. In return for supporting the Digital Economy Bill in the final wash- up vote the Conservatives demanded the removal of Clause 43 which related to orphan works, copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be located, which had been criticised by photographers. Other clauses that were removed during wash-up included provisions for the funding of regional news consortia. The bill received its second reading in the House of Commons on 6 April 2010. There was support for the bill from both the governing Labour party and the opposition Conservatives.Mark Sweney, Digital economy bill gets reluctant Conservative support in The Guardian, 6 April 2010 It passed third reading on 7 April, with Royal Assent granted on 8 April. The Act is in force, however the requirements for the sections relating to online piracy (ss.3‚Äì18) to have legal effect were never implemented.  Initial controversies arising from the proposed Act   Controversial aspects  Aspects of the proposed Act which were strongly criticised included: :* The Digital Economy Bill incorporated a graduated response policy despite the alleged file sharer not necessarily having to be convicted of copyright offences.Digital Economy Bill The bill also introduced fines of up to ¬£50,000 for criminal offences relating to copyright infringement ‚Äì for example if music is downloaded with intent to sell. The high penalty is considered to be proportionate to the harm caused to UK industries. An appeals process exists whereby the accused can contest the case however, the concern has been expressed that this process will be costly and that, in requiring the individual to prove their innocence, the bill reverses the core principles of natural justice. :* Critics saw serious repercussions and perceived the concepts as ill-considered and likely to prove \\"disastrous\\". While the British Phonographic Institute claimed the bill was vital for the future of creative works in the UK. The Conservative party spokesman for Culture and Media stated that those downloading should be given a criminal record. Conversely, the Liberal Democrat party spokesman for Culture and Media claimed the bill was reckless and dangerous stating that children could unwittingly be file sharing causing an entire family to lose their internet connection. In addition to this, there was concern that hackers may access internet connections to download files and leave the bill payer responsible. :* Providers of public Wi-Fi access is uncertain. Responsibility for breaches could be passed on to the provider due to the difficulty in identifying individual users. The internet provider therefore may risk losing internet access or facing a hefty fine if an infringement of copyright takes place. Many libraries and small caf√©s for example may find this impossible to adhere to as it would require detailed logging of all those requiring internet access. In libraries in particular this may provide challenges to the profession‚Äôs importance of user privacy and could force changes in future policies such as Acceptable Use Policies (AUP). Public libraries utilise AUPs in order to protect creative works from copyright infringement and themselves from possible legal liability. However, unless the AUP is accompanied by the provision of knowledge on how to obey laws it could be seen as unethical, as blame for any breaches is passed to the user.Britz, J. J. (2002). Information Ethics: its Demarcation and Application. In: Lipinski, T. A. (eds.) Libraries, Museums, and Archives: Legal and Ethical Challenges in the New Era of Information. Maryland: The Scarecrow Press. pp. 194‚Äì219. :* The hospitality sector considered that it would be badly affected by the Act. The British Hospitality Association has stated that hotels would have particular problems in providing details of guest‚Äôs internet access to Internet Service Providers and entire hotels may face disconnection. They have also expressed their concern that an individual's actions may lead to such a drastic outcome.Arthur, C. (2010). Opposition to the Digital Economy Bill. The Guardian. Availability: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/05/digital-economy-bill. Last accessed 30 March 2010. :* Internet service providers were also hostile towards the bill. TalkTalk stated that suspending access to the internet breached human rights. This view may be shared by many, as a survey carried out by the BBC found that 87% of internet users felt internet access should be the \\"fundamental right of all people\\". Certainly, people require access to the internet for many aspects of their life for example shopping, online banking, education, work and even socialising. Furthermore, TalkTalk Director of Regulation, Andrew Heaney has acknowledged that file sharing is a problem but the answer is to educate people and create legal alternatives. Heaney has also argued that disconnected offenders will simply create other user names to hide their identity and continue downloading. TalkTalk has claimed that 80% of youngsters would continue to download regardless of the bill and that internet service providers are being forced to police this without any workable outcomes.\\"Music fans will sidestep filesharing clampdown says TalkTalk\\" TalkTalk Press Centre 15 March 2010 :* Cable company Virgin Media also criticized the Digital Economy Bill believing it to be heavy handed and likely to alienate customers. Virgin advocated the development of alternative services which people would choose instead of file sharing. There was also a high level of public activism and protest against the Act, in many forms. The Guardian reported that hundreds were expected to march outside the House of Commons on 24 March 2010. Moreover, an estimated 12,000 people sent emails to their MPs, through the citizen advocacy organization 38 degrees. 38 degrees objected to the speed with which the bill was rushed through parliament, without proper debate, due to the imminent dissolution of parliament prior to a general election. In October 2009 TalkTalk launched its Don't Disconnect Us campaign asking people to sign a petition against the proposal to cut off the internet connections of those accused of unauthorized file sharing. By November 2009 the petition had almost 17,000 signatories and by December had reached over 30,000. The Pirate Party in the UK called for non-commercial file sharing to be legalized. Formed in 2009 and intending to enter candidates in the 2010 UK general election, the Pirate Party advocates reform to copyright and patent laws and a reduction in government surveillance.Pirate Party Official website, http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/  Opposition to the bill The provisions relating to copyright infringement and especially technical measures were highly controversial and were criticised by digital rights campaigners. The Open Rights Group, a privacy and digital rights organisation, took their concerns to the House of Lords. Concerns were raised about the impact on businesses offering Internet access to their customers, such as libraries and universities. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, called the bill \\"an utter disgrace. This is an attack on everyone's right to communicate, work and gain an education\\". He said that \\"politicians have shown themselves to be incompetent and completely out of touch with an entire generation's values\\". 38 Degrees, who worked with the Open Rights Group to mobilise opposition to the Act, state that over 22,000 people have emailed their MPs through their web site. 38 Degrees have also raised over ¬£20,000 in donations to fund newspaper advertisements against the bill. More than 35,000 people signed a Number 10 petition,http://www.dontdisconnect.us started by Andrew Heaney at ISP TalkTalk, objecting to being disconnected without fair trial. Over 100 people protested outside Parliament on 24 March 2010, including Labour MPs Tom Watson and John Grogan, Liberal Democrat prospective parliamentary candidate Bridget Fox, and writer and activist Cory Doctorow.Almost 35,000 people have signed a petition calling for the bill's disconnection provisions to be dropped. TalkTalk, Britain's second-largest ISP, has been a vociferous critic of the act. They opposed it from its earliest stages by staging media events, declaring that they would fight against the new laws in court, and commissioning research to demonstrate that music fans would simply transition to other, non-P2P tools (such as \\"applications which scan thousands of internet radio stations and download the desired tracks\\"). TalkTalk have also argued that the requirement in Ofcom's draft code of conduct that only ISPs with 400,000 customers or more would initially be subject to the Act \\"could [lead to] huge swathes of customers moving to smaller ISPs to avoid detection\\". BT said that they felt compelled to act \\"for our customers who otherwise run the risk of being treated unfairly\\". The Pirate Party UK were strongly opposed to it. The Green Party, whose Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sit with the two Swedish Pirate Party MEPs in the same group, opposed the bill. \\"The Digital Economy Bill is deeply flawed and illiberal...Any Green MPs will provide a rallying point for opposition to the Digital Economy Bill.\\" The Liberal Democrats opposed the parts that relate to the blocking of people's Internet connections. These parts were later dropped by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government (see below). Industry lobbying The Secretary of State Lord Mandelson was widely believed to be responsible for the copyright infringement provisions that would see the disconnection of internet subscribers. The Independent reported that according their Whitehall sources Lord Mandelson was persuaded that tough law were needed to reduce online copyright infringement following an intensive lobbying campaign by influential people in the music and film industry. It was also reported that there had been a meeting with DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen at the Rothschild family villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Lord Mandelson's spokesperson claimed that there had been no discussion of internet piracy during the Corfu dinner and suggested that the decision to reverse Lord Carter's findings had been taken in late July before the trip. The Times reported after the Corfu meeting that an unnamed Whitehall source had confirmed that before this trip, Mandelson had shown little personal interest in the Digital Britain agenda, which has been ongoing for several years. According to The Times, Mandelson returned from holiday and effectively issued an edict that the regulation needs to be tougher. At the time Mandelson denied that the two events were linked. In August 2011 a Freedom of Information (FOI) request showed that Lord Mandelson had decided to approve the inclusion of technical measures, such as the disconnection of internet access, some time before public consultation had finished. Letters from Lord Mandelson's office document talks with Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group on 2 July 2009, and that on the following day Lord Mandelson advised Lord Carter about the \\"possibility of [the Secretary of State] having a power to direct Ofcom to go directly to introduce technical measures\\". The government made an announcement that disconnection, was being considered for inclusion in the Digital Economy Bill on 25 August 2009.A Copyright Masquerade: How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms ZedBooks, pp196-210, on Lord Mandelson's reversal on internet disconnection and analysis of the FOI responses Support for the bill The Design and Artists Copyright Society and the British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies support the orphan works provision.DACS The Community Media Association supports the Act for the radio clauses stated to bring significant benefits to the community broadcasting sector as FM spectrum becomes available following digital radio switchover.Digital Economy Bill Benefits Community Radio Attitudes of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) towards the copyright infringement provisions in the bill were mixed. In interviews with ISPs by TechRadar, Virgin Media said that they shared the commitment to address copyright infringement, but that persuasion not coercion is the key; a heavy-handed, punitive regime would simply alienate Internet users. Sky, which is both an ISP and a content provider, was supportive of the government's commitment to underpin the fight against illegal file sharing through legislation, but not directly of the \\"website banning\\" proposal.TechRadar interviews with Virgin Media, TalkTalk, SkySky: Everyone must tackle filesharing cable.co.uk, 30 September 2009.  Ofcom review of sections 17 and 18  Following calls by citizens to repeal all or part of the Digital Economy Act on the Your Freedom website, the government asked Ofcom in February 2011 to review whether sections 17 and 18 of the act on website blocking are technically workable. Following the review by Ofcom, the government announced on 3 August 2011, that sections 17 and 18 of the act were to be dropped as they were not practically enforceable, and also as the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 had been successfully used to block access to a website on the grounds of copyright infringement.  Cost of implementation  In response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request Ofcom disclosed that it had spent ¬£1.8 million in the 2011/12 financial year on the implementation of the online copyright infringement provisions, section 3 to 16 of the Digital Economy Act, and the site blocking provisions, section 17 and 18. Ofcom planned to spend another ¬£4.0 million in 2012/13. These figures include ¬£100,000 spent on reviewing the technical workability of section 17 and 18, a review commissioned by the Government in February 2011. According to Ofcom the Digital Economy Act provides that internet service providers and copyright owners bear the cost of section 3 to 16, including the cost to Ofcom and an appeals body. They are also liable to pay Ofcom's cost incurred prior to actual implementation. However, Ofcom notes that the April 2011 ruling by the High Court on the judicial review of the online copyright infringement provisions provides that internet service providers are not liable to pay towards Ofcom' cost or that of an appeals body. Post-legislative legal inquiries into the Act  Judicial review  On 8 July 2010 TalkTalk were joined by BT, Britain's biggest ISP, in seeking a judicial review of the Act on the grounds of it receiving \\"insufficient scrutiny\\" and having the potential to \\"harm citizens and impact both businesses\\". They questioned whether the provisions were proportionate, respected privacy law, complied with EU law on ISP liability, and suggested that they would hinder a single European market in telecommunications services. The High Court of Justice granted the review permission on 10 November 2010. Mr Justice Kenneth Parker ruled in favour of the government on 20 April 2011. BT and TalkTalk appealed the ruling, however their appeal was dismissed Case No: C1/2011/1437, Royal Courts of Justice, Judgement of 6 March 2012  Select committee inquiry  On 10 November 2010, the same day as the judicial review, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of Parliament announced an inquiry into the act. The inquiry will consider \\"the implementation, practicality and likely effectiveness of the relevant measures contained in the act\\", and \\"the scope for additional and new approaches to ensure that original work is appropriately rewarded in online\\".  Digital Economy Act 2017  This legislation was updated by the Digital Economy Act 2017, which updates the anti-infringement provisions of existing laws, creates or updates criminal copyright breach provisions, and provides for a wider range of sentencing for criminal infringement.

Project 100,000 was initiated by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in October 1966 to meet the escalating manpower requirements of the American government's involvement in the Vietnam War. Inductees of the project died at higher rates than other Americans serving in Vietnam and following their service had lower incomes and higher rates of divorce than their non-veteran counterparts. The project was ended in December 1971 and has been the subject of controversy, especially during the manpower shortages of the Iraq War. Background At various times in its history, the United States military has recruited people who measured below specific mental and medical standards. Those who scored in certain lower percentiles of mental aptitude tests were admitted into service during World War II, though this experience eventually led to a legal floor of IQ 80 to enlist. Another instance occurred in the 1980s due to a misinformed Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. By October, 1966 monthly draft calls had been steadily increasing for 15 consecutive months and stood at 49,300, the highest since early 1951, the peak mobilization period of the Korean War, when 80,000 men a month were called up. In a series of decisions, the Pentagon lowered the required score to be inducted to as low as 10 on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (perfect score: 100)‚Äîa 6% drop (as of 2019, 10 remains the minimum score required for induction). McNamara thought he could turn below average soldiers into above average soldiers through use of technology and learning by use of video tapes. According to Hamilton Gregory, author of McNamara's Folly: The Use of Low-IQ Troops in the Vietnam > MacNamara was a lover of technology... MacNamara believed he could win the > war in Vietnam through the use of advanced technology and computerized > analysis... And he believed he could raise the intelligence of men through > the use of video tapes. Project Promoted as a response to President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty by giving training and opportunity to the uneducated and poor, the recruited men were classified as New Standards Men (or, pejoratively, as the \\"Moron Corps\\"). They had scored in Category IV of the Armed Forces Qualification Test, which placed them in the 10-30 percentile range. The number of soldiers reportedly recruited through the program varies, from more than 320,000 to 354,000, which included both voluntary enlistees and draftees (54% and 46%, respectively). Entrance requirements were loosened, but all the Project 100,000 men were sent through normal training programs with other recruits, and performance standards thus were the same for everyone. The US Army received 71% of recruits, followed by 10% by the Marines, 10% by the Navy and 9% by the Air Force. Project 100,000 soldiers included those unable to speak English, who had low mental aptitude, minor physical impairments and those who were slightly over- or underweight. They also included a special category made up of a control group of \\"normal\\" soldiers. Each of the different categories was identified in the soldiers' official personnel records by a large red letter stamped on the first page of their enlistment contracts. Human resources offices had to prepare reports on them, to be submitted monthly to the Department of the Army. The monthly reports did not disclose the identity of the soldiers. Aftermath While the project was promoted as a response to President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, it has been an object of criticism. Regarding the consequences of the program, a 1989 study sponsored by the DoD concluded: A 1995 review of McNamara's book In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam in the Washington Monthly severely criticized the project, writing that \\"the program offered a one-way ticket to Vietnam, where these men fought and died in disproportionate numbers ... the men of the 'Moron Corps' provided the necessary cannon fodder to help evade the political horror of dropping student deferments or calling up the reserves, which were sanctuaries for the lily-white.\\" Project 100,000 was highlighted in a 2006 op-ed in The New York Times in which former Wesleyan assistant professor and then Tufts assistant professor Kelly M. Greenhill, writing in the context of a contemporary recruitment shortfall, concluded that \\"Project 100,000 was a failed experiment. It proved to be a distraction for the military and of little benefit to the men it was created to help.\\" To explain the reason for veterans from the project faring worse in civilian life than their non-veteran peers, Greenhill hypothesized it might be related to the psychological consequences of combat or unpreparedness for the post- military transition.

W. Scripps Company; she was the great-great granddaughter of James E. Scripps, founder of The Detroit News. In 1993, she was bludgeoned by her estranged second husband, Scott Douglas, as she slept in her Westchester County, New York home. Family and marriages Anne Scripps (formerly Morrell) was born on November 18, 1946, to Captain James E. Scripps III, a former merchant mariner, and Anne Scripps (n√©e Gibbs). She has a brother, James IV, and a sister, Mary. In 1969, when Scripps was 23 years of age, she married Anthony Morrell, a Rye stockbroker. The wedding was held in the St. Regis Hotel. The marriage resulted in two daughters, Alexandra and Anne. Scripps' marriage to Morrell ended in divorce, but she loved and doted on her daughters greatly. At a party in 1988, Scripps met Scott Douglas, an out-of- work and self-employed house painter. She hired him to paint her house, which led the two to marry that October. They had a daughter Victoria, nicknamed Tori. Douglas did not get along with Alexandra, who thought of him as not bright or articulate enough for her mother, and she quickly moved out of the house.  Domestic violence and death Scripps' daughters noticed that Douglas drank heavily and became erratically violent towards their mother, openly hitting her in public on at least one occasion. Both daughters advised their mother to file for divorce and get an order of eviction to have him removed from the home. In 1991, Scripps took Tori and moved in with Alexandra. She had changed her will and moved back in for fear that Douglas would take Tori and flee. During the holidays, she discovered Douglas had removed Tori's birth certificate and other personal records from the house. Scripps and her two eldest daughters began documenting and keeping records of the assaults, and on December 6, 1993, went to obtain an eviction notice; however, the judge refused to order his eviction. Scripps told a friend that she began sleeping with a hammer under her bed because Douglas' new method of abuse was to wake her up in the middle of the night to scare and berate her. On December 31, 1993, Douglas bludgeoned Scripps with a hammer while she slept. Her daughter Anne had called the police on January 1, 1994, at 3:30 a.m., because she was unable to get into contact with her mother or Douglas. The police arrived and knocked down the locked door, and found Scripps unconscious in bed, her sheets soaked in blood, her terrier puppy next to her trying to comfort her. Across the hall Tori, then 3 years old, had witnessed the crime that left her mother's skull irreparably broken. Tori Douglas was reported as saying, \\"Daddy gave Mommy boo-boos. Daddy gave Mommy many boo-boos. Why is Mommy wearing warpaint?\\" Immediately the police began searching for Scott Douglas. In a matter of hours, Douglas' 1982 BMW was found on the Tappan Zee Bridge with the bloody hammer inside. The authorities dragged the Hudson River for him, but operated under the assumption he was still alive. As Scripps lay in the hospital, her first husband, Anthony Morrell, who was in the terminal stages of cirrhosis of the liver and had been hospitalized near Philadelphia, left his hospital bed to be at her side. A week after the attack ‚Äîtwo days after the authorities stopped dragging the Hudson for Douglas's body‚Äîon January 6, 1994, Scripps was taken off life support and died without regaining consciousness. She was 47 years old. After her death, she was able to give her liver, which was transplanted into her ex-husband, Anthony Morrell, saving his life. \\"Her daughters acted on what they knew would be their mother's wishes,\\" said family attorney, \\"Anne left this world the way she lived in it-- loving and giving.\\" Resolution In the days after Scripps's death, her family lashed out at the authorities who allowed Scott Douglas to remain in the home. Scripps's mother told the press, \\"This could have been prevented. My daughter would be alive today, if that judge hadn't let him stay here. I think it's criminal.\\" The family alleged that the New Rochelle Family Court Judge Ingrid Braslow refused to grant an order barring Douglas from the house in spite of the assertions that he beat Anne and tried to shove her from the car. However, court documents show that these allegations relate to the 1991 case that was not before Braslow. The transcript of the December 6 hearing shows Braslow was not asked to remove Douglas from the home. The Scripps family filed an $11-million suit against the county which was later dismissed. Three months after Anne Scripps' death, there was a break in the case when a railroad employee found the corpse of a man in jeans washed ashore in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Dental records identified the corpse as Scott Stuart Douglas. The Scripps family met the news with relief. \\"It was a surprise, but the nightmare is over,\\" stated Anne Morrell. \\"We don't have to worry anymore about him coming after us or Tori,\\" said Alexandra Morrell. Authorities re- examined the system that failed Anne Scripps resulting in changes in Westchester County's domestic violence procedures. Scripps's ex-husband Anthony Morrell died in 2005. Family aftermath On September 25, 2009, The Huffington Post reported that Anne's daughter Anne had jumped to her death from the Tappan Zee Bridge. Authorities found a note and believed Anne got out of her car and jumped off the bridge the evening of September 24. Three days later, her body was found in the Hudson. The contents of the suicide note were released by an interview on ABC's 20/20 in 2010. Family friends stated that Anne never got over her mother's murder and she had been hospitalized several times for major depression. At the time of her death, she was finalizing a divorce and had a son named Michael. In 2011, Tori ‚Äî who had been raised in Vermont after being adopted by her mother's sister, Mary Scripps Carmody, and her husband, Robert ‚Äî was arrested in Burlington, Vermont, for possession of heroin. She was subsequently convicted of drug-related crimes and served time in prison. In 2018, Tori was arrested for possession of stolen property after she pawned the heirloom jewelry of her adoptive mother and stole her car.

He also worked with Sanjalay Press and the International Centre for Circassian Studies. International Centre for Circassian Studies (ICCS) Jaimoukha was director of the International Centre for Circassian Studies (ICCS), an institute specialising in the dissemination of Circassian culture and folklore. The Centre is the brainchild of the famous Circassian writer and film producer and director Mohydeen Quandour. The principal aim of the Centre is the development and dissemination of Circassian literature, culture and folklore. There is a particular emphasis on boosting the status of Circassian and to promote its teaching and use. The Centre publishes a bilingual journal (in Circassian and English) \\"The Hearth Tree\\". The publications of the Centre can be accessed via its website. Jaimoukha devised a Latin orthography for Kabardian (Eastern Circassian) that is characterised by relative simplicity (considering the complexity of the language). An advantage of this system is that it has a one- to-one correspondence with the current Cyrillic orthography used for Kabardian, and already a software has been designed to render one orthography into the other, making it possible to turn works already published in Cyrillic Kabardian into the new orthography, and vice versa, facilitating transition from one system to the other.  Work at the Royal Scientific Society  Jaimoukha previously held the position of Assistant President of the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) in the period 2003-2007. He published a number of studies and bibliographic tomes during his tenure at RSS, including Scientific Integrity, Intellectual Capital Report, and Bibliography of the Publications of the Royal Scientific Society. Circassian culture and folklore Jaimoukha was a strong advocate of the revival of all aspects of Circassian culture and folklore, including obsolete and defunct genres of art and culture. He wrote a number of books and articles in journals and newspapers championing the raising of the status of the Circassian language in both the Circassian republics in the Northwest Caucasus (where about one million Circassians live) and in the diaspora (principally in Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands), where some 5 million descendants of the 19th-century Circassian forced immigrants reside. The ultimate survival of the Circassian language and culture is intimately associated with the political fate of the Circassians in the Caucasus and the re-establishment of Circassia as a viable state, recognised as a full member of the comity of nations. The unification of the Kabardians, Cherkess, Adigeans, and Shapsugh in the Northwest Caucasus in the political and cultural spheres is a requisite step towards enhanced autonomy. Jaimoukha was among the vocal Circassians actively engaged in raising awareness of Circassian issues amongst the Circassians themselves and at a global level. He planned to publish a book on the controversial issue of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, to be held in Circassia. Jaimoukha was a proponent of North Caucasian unity and independence (from Daghestan in the east to Abkhazia in the west). He advocated Circassian independence on a number of media outlets. He referred to the historical lands of the Circassians as \\"Circassia\\". Despite the linguistic diversity, the peoples of the North Caucasus share similar traditions, beliefs and culture. His work \\"Thoughts on North Caucasian Federation\\" maps a plan of unification of the western part of the region (the historical lands of the Circassians (Adiga), Abkhaz-Abaza [Apswa] and the Ubykh). According to this scheme, the Adiga entities (perhaps with the inclusion of the Abaza) would be united into one independent state that might eventually opt to enter into federative arrangements with the already independent Abkhaz and the Karachai-Balkar state. This would remove the artificial tensions that might flare up into open conflict between the Kabardians and Balkar in Kabardino-Balkaria and the Karachai and Cherkess in the Karachay‚ÄìCherkess Republic. The Adigeans would become more secure and more resistant to the Russian drive to undo their fragile republic. It would seem that the logical (interim) step of uniting the Kabardians and Cherkess into one autonomous entity on the one hand and the Karachai and Balkar into another, on the other, is considered taboo by the authorities in the two republics. Collaborations Principal literary collaborations included work with Nicholas Awde, the editor of the Caucasus World series published by Routledge and co-owner of the publishing house Bennett and Bloom, JonArno Lawson, the writer of a number of fantastic books, and Michel Malherbe, the prolific writer and editor of the Parlons... series published by the French publishing house L'Harmattan. A work on the Adigean dialect of Circassian was scheduled to be published by L'Harmattan in 2010. Jaimoukha contributed five articles (on the Circassians, Kabardians, Karachai, Dagestanis, and Jordan) in Carl Skutsche's seminal three-volume work Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities, published by Routledge in 2004 in New York. There was a close co-operation with the Circassian writer Luba Belaghi (Balagova; publications in Circassian and Russian) in the framework of the publications of the International Centre for Circassian Studies.

St Mark's Basilica: the office of Procurator of San Marco originated as a position to administer the assets of the basilica. 18th-19th century costume of the Procurator of Saint Mark, wearing the sash of the Order of the Golden Star The office of Procurators of Saint Mark (Italian: Procuratore di San Marco) was the second most prestigious life appointment in the Republic of Venice, after that of Doge of Venice. History Originating in the ninth century, the Procurator's original duties were to attend to the fabric and administration of St Mark's Basilica. There was originally one Procurator, appointed by the Doge, but between 1231 and 1442, their number increased to nine procurators appointed by the Great Council of Venice. Their duties also expanded in 1269 to include the protection of orphans and the insane, as well as the execution of wills. Appointment as a Procurator of San Marco was one of the highest honours the Most Serene Republic could bestow on its leading citizens, next to the Dogate, and along with the latter, the only appointments for life. The nine procurators consisted of: * the Procuratori de Supra, who took care of the administration of St Mark's Basilica; * the Procuratori de Citra, who dispensed charity and attended to wills in the sestieri of San Marco, Castello, and Cannaregio; and * the Procuratori de Ultra, who performed the same function for the sestieri of Dorsoduro, Santa Croce, and San Polo. The Procurators' offices were located in the Procuratie in the Piazza San Marco. The office today The office of Procurator of St Mark's was not abolished at the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. Instead, the Procurators remained responsible for administering the assets of St. Mark's Basilica, under the authority of the Patriarch of Venice. The position was confirmed by a royal decree issued by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in 1931. Today, there are seven procurators, with the president holding the title of First Procurator of St Mark's (Primo Procuratore di San Marco). The Procurators work closely with architects and engineers to ensure the historic preservation of St. Mark's Basilica.

It was founded on 28 January 1785Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Leoben but after the death in 1800 of the first and only Bishop, its incorporation into the Diocese of Seckau was ordered in 1804 by Emperor Francis II. Although the Bishops of Seckau administered it from 1808, however, Papal consent to the unification was not given until 1859.  History  The Diocese of Leoben was created at the wish of Emperor Joseph II from territory belonging to the Archdiocese of Salzburg. Pope Pius VI gave his consent to its creation on 17 March 1786. The first and only Bishop of Leoben was Alexander Franz Joseph Graf Engl von und zu Wagrain, appointed on 20 Nov 1783 and ordained bishop on 30 Apr 1786. The episcopal seat was in the church of the former G√∂ss Abbey near Leoben, which Joseph II had dissolved, and where a cathedral chapter was also set up. The diocesan territory comprised the districts of Bruck an der Mur and Judenburg together with the area round Aussee, and contained 157 parishes. After the death of Bishop Count Engl on 22 February 1800 the diocese was administered until 1808 by the chapter, and thereafter by the bishops of Seckau. As early as 13 July 1804, the unification of the Diocese of Leoben with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Seckau was ordered by Habsburg Emperor Franz II. The papacy delayed its ratification however, and the unification did not actually take place until 1 September 1859.  References   Literature  * Tomek, Ernst, 1935-39: Kirchengeschichte √ñsterreichs.

I just happen to see > landscape in the abstract events of paint. - James Lavadour Background > I'm a tribal member and grew up on the Umatilla reservation, and I love it > there. One of the aspects of tribal life is that the land and I are one. - > 2005 Early life James Lavadour was born in 1951 to parents of Chinook, Walla Walla, German, Irish, Assiniboine, and French Canadian descent in Pendleton, Oregon. Discovering his love for painting as a child, Lavadour never completed high school, however he was encouraged by his family to explore his artistic endeavors. As a child he was inspired by what he described as \\"The Sistine Chapel\\": the peeling and water stained ceiling of his grandmothers house, with its drips and exposed layers, a visual experience that would influence his work for the rest of his life.\\"Art Review: James Lavadour at Hallie Ford.\\" The Oregonian: Oregon Live. (retrieved 22 Nov 2009) When he was young, his parents worked at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. A troubled teenager and a poor student, he focused on working at any job he could find: delivery boy, canner, janitor, carpenter, and even a firefighter. Without opportunities to gain formal artistic training he used books to explore the world of art and culture, including books about: Charles Marion Russell, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Diebenkorn, Pierre Bonnard, J. M. W. Turner, and Franz Kline. The major turn for his artistic interest came with exploring Chinese and Asian art, a different creation process where \\"the kinetic experience is the essence of making art.\\" Professional and personal life Exhibiting in Seattle, Washington since the 1970s, Lavadour's first major exhibitions came with his involvement in Sacred Circle, a Native American art gallery. A hiker, Lavadour's exploration of the mountain regions of his home continue to serve as a major source of inspiration for his work today.

A painting is a complex event with many things going on at > multiple levels. Close, far, color, layers, scrapes, and drips all swirled > around by memories. I keep it all organized with structure. Structure is the > bed to the river. >  James Lavadour Rejecting the iconography and symbolism inherent in Western art, Lavadour believes that rather than trying to make his artwork mean something it eventually just became something. A theory of rejection that he credits to his relationship with the environment and growing up on the Umatilla reservation. Early work Primarily self-taught, Lavadour grew up exploring his environment on the Umatilla Indian Reservation and Western Oregon. His earlier works, reminiscent of German romanticism, displayed what an impact geology and landscape had on his creation process through his own monochromatic abstract lens (he described these works as his Interiors). Described as \\"emotional interpretations of the land,\\" these Interiors tend to look like painted, hazy photograph-like paintings with streaks of color traveling through them. James Lavadour at PDX Contemporary Art gallery, 2012 Current work In the 1990s Lavadour started to explore printmaking. The melding of printmaking with his painting led to complex layer usage in these new works. The layering technique of printmaking makes the geological features of the landscape look like maps or as if they are moving. These new works have also been compared to the art of Gerhard Richter. He also began to explore other themes, influenced by his interest in Chinese painting, abstract expressionism and jazz music (specifically John Coltrane), however, landscapes continue to be the basis for his work. The usage of panels is also seen throughout Lavadour's work, involving selections of works placed together to provide a panorama and visual exploration of the environment through Lavadour's eyes. Lavadour is represented by PDX Contemporary Art, in Portland. Creation process He wakes up about 3:00 AM every morning to work in his studio on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Music serves as an inspiration and a motivator; often jazz music by the likes of some of his favorite artists: John Coltrane, Sun Ra and Miles Davis. Lavadour's process generally involves applying layers of paint, then scraping or wiping it away, performing his own form of erosion on his unique landscapes. He believes there are two major aspects to his work: the capturing of the sediments, layers and shape of the physical scenery, and then an exploration of the energy of that scenery, its emotions and its relationship with the cosmos. This exploration allows him to discover the physics of the paint - the way it moves on the canvas and its final form, over the color manipulation that many artists often focus on. Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts Motivated by his experiences as a fellow at Rutgers University, in 1990 Lavadour co-founded Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts, a non-profit arts organization that brings \\"technology, instruction and cultural exchange\\" to artists on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

Members of the club had to be a current OMMP cardholder and pay an entry fee. The cafe hosted a number of activities, including the annual Oregon Medical Cannabis Awards, which began in 2002. The OMCA was the first medical marijuana strain evaluation competition in the United States, and the only competition to track the medical conditions of the judges and medical effectiveness of the strains relative to specific conditions.

Agricultural attach√©s may be directly employed by the sending country's agriculture ministry, or they may be employed by the foreign ministry. Typical activities of an agricultural attach√© include reporting on crop conditions, food availability, domestic agricultural policy and the foreign trade outlook in agricultural commodities; negotiating food aid agreements and agricultural credit lines; implementing agricultural technical assistance programs; facilitating professional contacts, exchanges, and technology transfer; assisting in negotiating bilateral and multilateral trade agreements; and promoting the exports of agricultural and food products. In many cases, agricultural attach√©s may also bear responsibility for issues related to the environment, food security, food safety, fisheries, forestry, and indeed anything related to rural areas and the rural economy. Diplomatic status The emergence of agricultural attach√©s with diplomatic status grew out of the posting of agricultural commissioners in the 19th century. In modern times, although the term \\"agricultural attach√©\\" is commonly applied to diplomats responsible for agricultural affairs, these diplomats often possess other, higher diplomatic titles and ranks, up to and including the rank of minister-counselor. Often, agricultural officers of foreign embassies will form an informal group to compare notes and to collaborate on issues of mutual interest with regard to the host country. In Washington, D.C., for example, foreign embassies' agricultural attach√©s created the Agricultural Counselors Forum in the 1970s. Responsibilities Originally, agricultural attach√©s primarily bore responsibility for reporting on agricultural and rural conditions in the host country and other countries in a multi-country area of responsibility. In 1934, U.S. agricultural attach√©s began supporting trade negotiations. During and after World War II, their responsibilities expanded to include oversight and management of food assistance, credit, and technical assistance programs.National Archives, Record Group 16, Records of the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture, General Correspondence, 1906-75, Foreign Relations (1940), Box 87. Memorandum for the Secretary, June 25, 1940, \\"Re: Need for clearer publicity on Inter-American cartel,\\" from Mordecai Ezekial\\"The United States Farmer and the World Around Him,\\" speech by John J. Haggerty, Director of Foreign Agricultural Relations, contained in the Journal of Farm Economics, December 1952 Today an \\"agricultural attach√©\\" may have other responsibilities as well, related to environmental affairs, arrangement of international credit lines, or consumer protection. For example, in Washington, D.C., the Austrian Embassy features a \\"Counselor (Agriculture and Environment)\\", the Royal Thai Embassy has an officer responsible for \\"Organic Food and Agriculture\\", and the German Embassy includes a minister-counselor for \\"Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection\\". In virtually all cases, agricultural attach√©s fall under authority of the chief of the diplomatic mission (ambassador or charg√© d'affaires) so that in addition to answering to their respective agriculture ministries, they also must report to the chief of mission. As an example, under U.S. law, this dual line of authority is attested in Title 7, Chapter 87, Subchapter V of the U.S. Code and U.S. Department of Agriculture regulation DR-1051-001, in which the attach√©s are subordinated to the Secretary of Agriculture, and in Title 22, Chapter 52, Section 3927 of the U.S. Code, in which they are subordinated to the chief of mission. Services Australia The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) has 12 agricultural officers in 12 diplomatic missions abroad. According to the DAFF official website, > These officers: > play a major part in Australia's efforts to remove or lower market access > barriers and facilitate trade > monitor emerging international issues > help resolve quarantine issues > provide briefings and assist with visiting delegations. The current roster of agricultural officers can be found here. Austria The Austrian Ministry of Agriculture (often colloquially called in German \\"Das Lebensministerium\\", or \\"Ministry of Life\\") posts \\"agricultural and environmental attach√©s\\" to 7 countries as well as the headquarters of the European Union in Brussels. Some of these officers have regional responsibilities, covering more than one country. According to the ministry's official website, > In addition to their bilateral tasks (they inform the Ministry of Life about > current environmental and agricultural affairs), some attach√©s are also > responsible for representing the Ministry of Life at several international > organisations like the OECD, FAO, or the United Nations. They are the > contact persons at bilateral visits and events and cultivate the contacts in > the Ministries in charge of agricultural and technical affairs of the > relevant countries. > In the course of the EU enlargement the responsibilities of the attach√©s in > the new Member States have further developed.

Canada Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada operates the Agri-Food Trade Service \\"to support agricultural productivity and trade in an industry that recorded exports of $31.5 billion in 2007...the Agri-Food Trade Service (ATS) was established to support various agriculture and agri-food sector clients, including Canadian food exporters.\\" Canadian agricultural attach√©s posted abroad, though typically selected by and from the ranks of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, do not however work for the Agri-Food Trade Service, but rather as employees of the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service (TCS), and are listed on the rosters of these commissioners maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. China The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture posts agricultural officers to the United States, the Philippines, European Union, WTO, FAO, Brazil, India, Japan, France, and Australia. According to the ministry's website, one of the mandates of the ministry is to \\"undertake foreign-related agricultural affairs and organize related international economic and technical exchanges and cooperation.\\" European Union The European Union, a regional bloc, both sends and accredits agricultural attach√©s. The European Union's delegation list for its mission in Washington, D.C., for example, includes an agricultural counselor and first secretary for agriculture in the \\"Trade & Agriculture Section\\". Conversely, many countries post agricultural attach√©s to Brussels to represent their interests before the European Commission, including members states of the European Union. In the latter case, member states' attach√©s assigned to a Permanent Representation to the European Union perform a fundamentally different function from that of bilateral attach√©s. They do not cover bilateral relations between two countries, but rather participate in EU decision-making and implementation procedures, contributing to coordination and working out of national positions, representing those positions, and preparing and attending relevant (Council and comitology) meetings. France The French Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries maintains an extensive network of agricultural attach√©s abroad, with representatives to three international organizations (World Trade Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and United Nations Industrial Development Organization), to the European Union, as well as to over 90 bilateral diplomatic missions. According to the French Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries official website, > Counselors or attach√©s have the agricultural business tasks: >  Observe, monitor and analyze the positions of countries in which they are > located as to national, EU and international agricultural, fisheries, trade > and veterinary and phytosanitary regulations >  Inform the French authorities and especially the Ministry of Food, > Agriculture and Fisheries, on the changing positions of the countries > concerned on the common agricultural policy issues including forest policy, > common fisheries, veterinary and phytosanitary regulations and international > negotiations directly or indirectly on these issues (WTO, OECD ...) >  Facilitate dialogue between French authorities and the countries of its > area of responsibility, >  To promote French positions to the governments of such countries on the > Common Agricultural Policy, geographic appellations, multilateral trade > negotiations, >  Encourage the development of agri-food trade of France to the countries > in which located, which includes a precise knowledge of regulations > applicable to trade and food, assistance to operators facing difficulties > with the authorities of countries concerned, >  Develop an influence strategy (sustainable development, safety ...). > Counselors or attach√©s for agricultural affairs are under the authority of > the chief of the economics section at the Embassy of France in the country > concerned. Germany The Federal Republic of Germany's Ministry of Nutrition, Agriculture and Consumer Protection has agricultural attach√©s in 18 diplomatic missions. Hungary The Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) maintain agricultural attach√©s in nine countries: Germany, the United States of America (also accredited to Canada), Russia (also accredited to Armenia and Uzbekistan), Italy (also an FAO representation), France, Belgium (Permanent Representation to the European Union), Spain, China, and Romania. The attach√©s are in the employ of the MFA but MARD directs their work. MARD encourages submission of attach√© reports that contribute significantly to the decisions of farmers and their organizations as well as other actors in the agricultural sector and the food industry. MARD has published a monthly Newsletter (K√ºlhoni H√≠rlev√©l) compiled from open information in the reports since 2004. Mexico The Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) maintains agricultural attach√©s in 5 diplomatic missions. They are charged with responsibility for \\"identification of export demand, market information, organization of trade missions and promotion missions for Mexican agricultural and food products.\\" Netherlands The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (MinLNV) of the Netherlands includes a Foreign Agricultural Service which posts agricultural attach√©s to more than 40 overseas locations. According to the ministry, the service's officers \\"are trained to assist Dutch agricultural small and medium-sized enterprises in their activities on foreign markets. The Agricultural Offices abroad also function as a liaison between Dutch agriculture, food, agri-business, fisheries, nature management organisations and agricultural research institutions and their counterparts.\\" Philippines The Department of Agriculture of the Philippines posts agricultural attach√©s to 6 countries. Russian Federation The Russian Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Administrative Work and External Relations administers Russia's agricultural attach√© service. As of August 2008 Russia maintained agricultural attach√©s in 8 countries. Officially, Russian agricultural attach√©s are referred to as \\"attach√©s for the agroindustrial complex\\" in Russian Ministry of Agriculture internal documents. United States The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) includes a Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) created in 1930, but with a history reaching back to the mid-19th century. FAS staffs 103 offices in 82 countries around the world, and also monitors and reports on the agricultural trade matters of an additional 70 countries. These numbers include offices for conduct of foreign agricultural relations with the World Trade Organization in Geneva, the United Nations organizations in Rome, and the European Union Commission in Brussels. The majority of reports written by U.S. agricultural attach√©s are posted to the Foreign Agricultural Service website and are available to the general public. The Secretary of Agriculture determined that overseas officials of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) should also be afforded the benefits of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Accordingly, APHIS officers are also titled agricultural attach√©s. In addition, other USDA employees, notably of the Agricultural Research Service and the Forest Service, are periodically posted abroad with this diplomatic status.

Biography Early life William Speechly was born near Peterborough, Northamptonshire, probably the second son (baptised 25 February 1735) of Ralph Speechly, a butcher and grazier of Orton Longueville, Huntingdonshire, and his wife Sarah Blackwell. He was said to have had a good education and showed an early interest in horticulture, engraving sketches of fruit, flowers, and designs on copper plates. Speechly served an apprenticeship as a gardener at the estate of William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam, at Milton Abbey, Northamptonshire. He was subsequently employed by Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle at Castle Howard, North Yorkshire and then as head gardener to Sir William St Quintin, 4th Baronet at Scampston Hall, Yorkshire. In 1767 he became head gardener to William Henry Cavendish- Bentinck, the 3rd Duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire. At Welbeck Abbey In 1771 Bentinck sent Speechly on a tour of gardens in Holland where it is thought he learned about the design of stoves for hothouses, which he later improved on. In 1776 Bentinck asked him to write a description of the method of planting trees on the Nottinghamshire estates for Alexander Hunter's edition of John Evelyn's Silva. This later appeared as an article in Hunter's Georgical Essays (1803), in which Speechly also contributed a note on the possibility of raising pineapples. Speechly established the first effective system for the cultivation of pineapples in England. He was particularly concerned that they should not be kept at too hot a temperature in the winter and experimented with forcing pineapples in beds of oak leaves instead of the comparatively expensive and unpredictable tanner's bark. In 1779 he published a Treatise on the Culture of the Pine Apple. This was followed in 1790 by a Treatise on the Culture of the Vine, which described 50 species of grapes, and discussed hothouse culture, the construction and management of vineyards in open air, pruning, irrigation, grafting, insect and blight control. The work was organised in four books: the first presenting an annotated list of 50 grape varieties, and discussing the management of the vine in the hothouse; the second on the vinery and including observations on pruning and watering; the third covering grafting, insect control, and remarks on the age and size attained by vines; and the fourth on vineyards. Both works were republished in one volume in 1820. In 1797 Sir John Sinclair, president of the Board of Agriculture, asked Speechly to prepare sections on gardening and domestic rural economy for a comprehensive work on agriculture. But the project was laid aside in 1798, and in 1800 Speechly's manuscript was returned to him at his own request. He then began writing A General Treatise on Gardening. Later life In 1801 following the death of his younger son, Speechly left Welbeck Abbey to take over management of his son's farm at Woodborough Hall, Nottinghamshire. He was succeeded by his pupil, Joseph Thompson, then gardener to the late Lord John Cavendish, Northamptonshire. During this time he neglected his manuscript on rural economy, but on his retirement to King's Newton Hall, near Melbourne, Derbyshire, he completed and enlarged it. This work, devoted to the management of cottage gardens, was published in 1820, with several other essays appended, under the title Practical Hints on Domestic and Rural Economy. He received the honorary medal of the Board of Agriculture for his essays on agriculture. Speechly died on 1 October 1819 aged 86 at Great Milton, Oxfordshire, while living with his only surviving child Sarah and her husband John Stevenson,Sarah married John Stevenson 11 March 1805 in Woodborough, Nottinghamshire. They are both mentioned in Speechly's will a surgeon.

It is necessary to have closed systems like hospitals and primary care services to employ staff and ensure money is administered with probity but they are all parts of an open system of healthcare and changes imposed in any one closed system will have unintended consequences elsewhere through a feedback mechanism that may, or may not, be predictable. Traditional approaches have sought to manage health problems by tighter control of organisations which cover a wide range of health problems, hospitals and community care for example with patients being referred to the former and discharged to the latter. This two-box approach has many weaknesses, implying, for example, that a hospital is not a community service. Another approach is to present different levels of care in the form of a Venn diagram. For serious, acute problems, a fractured femur for example the spectrum of the relative contributions of the different sectors of care, are consistent from between countries and within a country. Self care is minimal, primary care by an ambulance service brief, and most care is provided in secondary care, with tertiary care being needed for the person who has multiple injuries in addition to the fractured femur and needs the services of a trauma center.

The traffic-lanes (or clearways) indicate the general direction of the ships in that zone; ships navigating within a TSS all sail in the same direction or they cross the lane in an angle as close to 90 degrees as possible. TSSs are used to regulate the traffic at busy, confined waterways or around capes. Within a TSS there is normally at least one traffic-lane in each main-direction, turning-points, deep-water lanes and separation zones between the main traffic lanes. Most TSS schemes include 'inshore traffic zones' between the traffic-lanes and the coast. The inshore traffic zone is unregulated and is not intended to be used for through traffic but rather for local traffic, fishing and small craft. A ship navigating in a traffic-lane should sail in the general direction of that lane. The body of water between two opposite lanes is to be avoided by vessels travelling within the TSS as far as possible except in certain circumstances such as emergencies or for fishing activities. Where needed there are special zones where a lane splits into two channels: one ongoing and the other to the nearby port(s). The TSS rules are incorporated in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (Under Part B, Section I, Rule 10- Traffic Separation Schemes). An individual TSS is controlled by a vessel traffic service.  Objectives  Objectives of IMO Routeing Schemes: # Help reduce and manage head on situations for the streams of opposing traffic # Help manage crossing situation arising while entering or coming out of port # In areas of offshore activities, directives regarding safe distance from the installations # Providing routes for deep draught vessels # Avoiding presence of routine traffic from some areas as desired by administration # Better management of inshore traffic zone, fishing zones and areas dangerous to navigation due to presence of isolated dangers and shoal patches in a high density traffic area. Crossing Top: Without current, Bottom: Strong current from the left If a ship wants to cross a traffic-lane it should do so at a right angle to avoid endangering ship traffic using the traffic-lanes (although traffic in the lane does not automatically have the right-of-wayCollision of the Cornelis Vrolijk and the ferry Primrose (Dutch), visited 20 November 2009). To minimize the amount of time a crossing ship spend crossing the traffic-lanes, there should be a right angle between the lane direction and the keel direction ‚Äì even if currents might shift the actual direction of the ship's movement to some angle other than 90 degrees. Locations TSSs are used in locations where there is a lot of traffic (busy shipping areas) where not regulating the traffic would lead to more accidents. In Europe, many TSS areas are found around the Southern part of the North Sea including the English Channel. Other TSSs are in place off Land's End and around Ouessant (Ushant). Well-known TSS locations include the English Channel, German Bight, Singapore, and Cape Horn. The Dover Strait/D√©troit du Pas de Calais was the first International Maritime Organisation (IMO) approved traffic separation scheme in the world in 1967. Other TSS areas can be found in the Mediterranean Sea, western side of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific.

The two married shortly thereafter, and have one daughter. Atanasiu later drew controversy for having Bi»ôboacƒÉ's brother hired at the Agriculture Ministry (then controlled by a PNL colleague) and at the Authority for State Assets Recovery once Atanasiu was in charge there; as well as giving out jobs to his best man and business partner and to a business partner of his wife's.

From 1987 to 1995, he was an engineer at the mechanical plant in his native town, serving as chief of production from 1995 to 1996 and as director from 1997 to 2001. From 1994 to 1996, he belonged to the administrative council of another factory there, while heading a water company in Alba Iulia from 1996 to 1997. From 1997 to 2000, he was on the administrative council of the former State Property Fund, and from 2001 to June 2004, he administered a Dinu Patriciu-owned, Rompetrol subsidiary, pipe manufacturer in Sibiu. Profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site; accessed November 22, 2009 Profile at the Authority for State Assets Recovery site; accessed November 22, 2009 Atanasiu entered politics shortly after the 1989 Revolution, joining the PNL in February 1990. From the following month until 1992, he was secretary of the party's Cugir organisation, and its president from 1992 to 1993. Since 1993, he has been president of the Alba County PNL chapter. From 1992 to 1996, he was a member of the Cugir town council, and in 1996 joined the Alba County Council, of which he was president from June to December 2004. He was on the PNL's permanent central bureau from 2001 to 2002 and from 2005 to 2006, also serving as a party vice president from 2006 to 2008. Defence Minister He was named Defence Minister at the end of 2004, among the cited reasons being his work at the Cugir plant (which specialised in military equipment) and his co- authorship in 2000 of a strategy for restructuring Romania's defence industry. Among his initiatives as minister were a reorganisation of the ministry, including a fight against corruption there and an elimination of redundancies; rest homes for combatants and houses for soldiers; and compensatory pay for personnel dismissed as part of an ongoing reduction in size of the Romanian Armed Forces. He also promoted a law ending conscription from 2007, a change he said would promote stability and discipline. He was in office during severe flooding in 2005 that the Army helped combat. He promoted a close strategic partnership with the United States, including a plan for building American military bases in Romania. However, despite affirming his commitment to Romania's participation in both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan in 2005, the following year he sought Romania's withdrawal from Iraq, a decision opposed and blocked by President Traian BƒÉsescu. \\"Retragere din Irak, rƒÉzboi √Æn Alian≈£a D.A.\\" (\\"Iraq Withdrawal, D.A.

Atanasiu's downfall as minister began in July 2006, when he remarked on television that the military intelligence service was spying on the presidential administration, and specifically on spokeswoman Adriana SƒÉftoiu.

Returning to South Africa he became involved in designing mosaics and leaded glass windows for new churches. Subsequently he specialized in the technique called dalles de verre sous beton, a method using coloured glass and concrete, developed in France after the second world war, and which he developed as a distinctive style during a return visit to France in 1964, when he studied the work of Gabriel Loire in Chartres, which profoundly informed his approach to the medium. From his studio in Pretoria, South Africa, Th√©ron spent 35 years creating windows for 137 churches, many educational institutions, civic buildings, and private houses. In 1978 he was awarded the medal of honour by the South African Academy for Arts and Science. The major achievement of the dalles de verre technique is the creation of window walls or walls of light, which can occupy entire walls in churches or other buildings, reaching from floor to ceiling.

She was built during the last years of the American War of Independence, but did not see action until the French Revolutionary Wars. She served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, in a career that spanned forty-five years. Terpsichore was launched in 1785, but was not prepared for active service until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793. She was initially sent to serve in the West Indies where in 1794 Captain Richard Bowen took command. Bowen commanded Terpsichore until his death in 1797, and several of her most memorable exploits occurred during his captaincy. Terpsichore served mostly in the Mediterranean, capturing three frigates, and in 1797 went as far as to attack the damaged Spanish first rate Sant√≠sima Trinidad, as she limped away from the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Sant√≠sima Trinidad mounted 136 guns to Terpsichores 32, and was the largest warship in the world at time. Terpsichore inflicted several casualties, before abandoning the attack. Terpsichore passed through several commanders after Bowen's death at Tenerife, and went out to the East Indies, where her last commander was Captain William Augustus Montagu. Montagu fought an action with a large French frigate in 1808, and though he was able to outfight her, he was not able to capture her. Terpsichore returned to Britain the following year, and spent the last years of the war laid up in ordinary. She survived in this state until 1830, when she was broken up. Construction and commissioning Terpsichore was ordered from James Betts, of Mistleythorn on 29 July 1782 and laid down there in November that year. She was launched on 29 July 1785 and completed between 31 January and November 1786, at a cost of ¬£8,295.18.3d, with a further ¬£104.15.2d spent on her boats, plus ¬£4,025 for fitting out and coppering. The war with America was over by the time she was ready for service, and with no immediate use for her with the draw-down of the navy, Terpsichore was placed in ordinary at Chatham. Early years and French Revolutionary Wars  With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, many ships that had been laid up were reactivated. Terpsichore was repaired by Pitcher, of Northfleet for the sum of ¬£2,979 between March and August 1793, and was then fitted for service at Woolwich for a further ¬£5,833 between August and 8 October 1793. After nearly a decade spent laid up she commissioned under her first captain, Sampson Edwards, in August 1793 and sailed for the Leeward Islands in December that year. She captured the privateer Montague on 16 August 1794, and in September that year Sampson left the ship, being replaced by Captain Richard Bowen. Bowen was sent to North America, where he learnt that , under Captain Sir Charles Knowles, was being blockaded in the Chesapeake by two French frigates. Bowen set out to relieve him, an act he accomplished on 17 May, when the two British ships escaped to sea. The French attempted to pursue, but broke off when the British offered battle. Terpsichore and Daedalus sailed in company to Halifax, after which Bowen returned to the Caribbean. Bowen and Terpsichore then operated in support of the British forces on Guadeloupe, which were under pressure from French forces, and helped to resupply them until it was deemed necessary to evacuate them. Terpsichore covered the withdrawal, with Bowen receiving a wound to the face from French shot while assisting in the evacuation of the last of the troops. The wound became dangerous in the Caribbean climate, and Bowen was sent home aboard Terpsichore with the despatches. North Sea and Mediterranean Mahonesa Captain Richard Bowen, Terpsichores commander for many of her greatest exploits until his death at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797 Bowen and the Terpsichore spent some time in the North Sea, until December 1795, when his old patron, Jervis, replaced Admiral William Hotham as commander of the Mediterranean Fleet. Jervis requested Bowen to come out and take command of a squadron of small vessels operating around Gibraltar in defence of British trade and the garrison there. In early October 1796 the British squadron under Sir John Man was chased into Gibraltar by a Spanish fleet. Bowen set out in Terpsichore to report this to Jervis, and having rendezvoused with of Jervis's fleet on 10 October, began the return voyage to Gibraltar. While off Cartagena on 13 October, a frigate was spotted under full sail. Bowen's crew had been reduced by sickness, but he decided to chase down the mysterious sail. After closing on her, and determining that she was attempting to manoeuvre into a position to better fight the Terpsichore, Bowen ordered a gun be fired to test her intent. This was instantly met with a broadside, and a general action began. After an hour and forty minutes the frigate surrendered, and was discovered to be the Spanish Mahonesa. Terpsichore had four men wounded during the battle and none killed. Mahonesa was taken into service with the British as . Bowen received a piece of plate valued at 100 guineas. Vestale Bowen refitted Terpsichore and departed on another cruise, capturing several small vessels on 12 and 13 November, sending them to Gibraltar, and on 22 November he learned from an American brig that he had encountered off Cape St. Mary's, that a Spanish ship bound for Cadiz from Montevideo was in the area. Bad weather prevented Bowen from locating the Spanish vessel at first, and he also had to escape from a Spanish ship of the line that appeared and chased Terpsichore for a while. The Spanish ship was found to be anchored in Cadiz, and at 10 am the next day Bowen entered the harbour, captured the ship and brought her out. Bowen continued to cruise off Cadiz, and while sailing through a gale on the morning of 12 December, the lookouts spotted a frigate. Bowen gave chase, with both ships hampered by the rough weather, so that it was only after 40 hours that Bowen was able to bring Terpsichore alongside and at 10 o'clock on the night of 13 December the two ships engaged each other. After two hours the frigate surrendered, and was discovered to be the 36-gun French Vestale, with 270 men aboard. She had lost her captain and 40 men killed, while her second captain and another 50 men were wounded. The Terpsichore had casualties of a quartermaster and three seamen killed, and nineteen wounded. Shortly after the French surrender all of Vestales masts and her bowsprit went by the board. She began to drift towards the breakers off Cadiz, while her crew were drunk. The British prize-crew managed to regain control, and both ships managed to ride out the storm that night. It was not until the following evening that the wind changed sufficiently for Bowen to attempt to tow his prize away. The line became snagged on a rock, and had to be cut for the safety of both vessels. When dawn broke the next day Bowen discovered that the French had risen up against the prize crew and retaken the ship, sailing her into Cadiz. Now bereft of his prize, Bowen returned to port empty handed, writing to Jervis that 'As we feel conscious of having done out duty, to the utmost of our power, we endeavour to console ourselves with the expectation of our conduct being approved.' Jervis confirmed this, writing Sant√≠sima Trinidad Bowen was at Gibraltar when news of Jervis's victory at the Battle of Cape St Vincent arrived. He immediately set out to join the fleet, and having fallen in with several other British frigates, including , came across the Spanish first rate Sant√≠sima Trinidad. The Spanish ship was flying the Union Jack above her own colours, indicating that she was in the hands of a British prize-crew, but the bad weather meant no meaningful exchange could take place between the frigates and the Spanish vessel, and it was suspected that the British colours were being used as a ruse de guerre. After the frigates lost sight of the ship in bad weather, Bowen hurried to report the sighting to Jervis. While returning to his station he again fell in with Sant√≠sima Trinidad, and determined to see if she would surrender to him. He opened fire on the massive Spanish vessel, at the time the world's largest warship, carrying 136-guns on four decks, over a hundred more guns than Terpsichore. The Spanish ship resisted Bowen's fire, and he broke off the attack. It was later discovered that Bowen's attack had killed nine men, and left a number of others badly wounded. Cutting out of Principe Fernando In April Jervis sent Bowen in Terpsichore accompanied by Dido to reconnoitre off Tenerife, where they found the Cadiz-bound Philippine frigates Principe Fernando and El Principe d'Asturia in the Bay of Santa Cruz. On the night of 17/18 April a joint cutting out expedition was mounted by the two British frigates, each sending three boats of which those from Terpsichore under the command of its first lieutenant (Lieutenant George Thorp) successfully captured the nearer of the Indiamen to the shore,Letters from Lieutenant George Thorp to his family Principe Fernando, sailing and towing her to sea while under fire from shore batteries for two hours. Santa Cruz Jervis again sent Bowen to reconnoitre off Tenerife in mid-1797, and at midnight on 18 June he captured a rich ship from the Manillas bound for Cadiz. Next, Terpsichore participated in the bombardment of Cadiz on 5 July. Bowen and Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson then prepared plans for an assault on Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 24 July Bowen was assigned to lead the landing parties onto the Mole. He led forty or fifty of his men and managed to land on the mole and take the battery covering the harbour by storm, spiking its guns, and was advancing into the town in pursuit of the fleeing Spanish. As he did so the Spanish fired a large round of grapeshot onto his party, killing Bowen, his first lieutenant (George Thorp) and many of his men, while Nelson and his men, who were just landing, were caught in the fire, Nelson being hit in his right arm. Bowen's body was recovered the next morning and returned to the British ships after the withdrawal. He was buried at sea on 27 July. Later French Revolutionary Wars Bowen was succeeded by Captain William Hall Gage, who took over command two days after Bowen's death, on 26 July 1797. Terpsichore worked to enforce the blockade of Malta throughout 1798. On 7 May 1798 Terpsichore captured the French Navy xebec Pierre, near Toulon south of Cape Sici√©.{{refnPierre, of six 6-pounder guns and 60 men, had been launched at Toulon Dockyard in August 1795. A marine caused a major incident on 10 August 1798 on Terpsichore. He was on guard at a cabin door when he fired his musket into a box of gunpowder, which blew up. The explosion injured the captain, first lieutenant, doctor, master, and 20 seamen, four of whom later died. On 23 June 1799 Terpsichore captured the 14-gun San Antonio. On 25 July 1800 Terpsichore was part of a squadron that also included , , , and the hired armed lugger . The squadron encountered the Danish frigate , which was escorting a convoy of two ships, two brigs and two galliots. Baker hailed her and said that he would send a boat to board the convoy. The Danish captain refused, and said that if a boat approached he would fire on it. Baker sent a midshipman and four men in a boat, and the Danes fired several shots, which missed the boat, but one of which killed a man on Nemesis. Nemesis then opened fire with her broadside. After an engagement of about 25 minutes, Freja, much damaged, struck. She had suffered eight men killed and many wounded; both Nemesis and Arrow each suffered two men killed and several wounded.London Chronicle, 26‚Äì29 July 1800, p.104. The British brought Freja and her convoy into the Downs on 6 August.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.157. They later released her, and presumably the rest of the convoy. This incident led to strained relations with Denmark, and, in order to anticipate any hostile move from Copenhagen, the British government despatched Earl Whitworth in August on a special mission to Copenhagen. The Danes not being ready for war, his mission staved off hostilities for about a year. In 1807, after the second battle of Copenhagen, the British captured Freja and took her into the Royal Navy as HMS Freya. Terpsichore then sailed for the Mediterranean. On 18 October, an Anglo- Portuguese squadron shared in the capture of the Ragusan polacca Madonna Della Gratia e San Gaetano, which was carrying plate, amongst other cargo. The British vessels were , Terpsichore, , and , and the Portuguese vessels, Principe Real, Reynha de Portugal, Alfonso di Albuquerque, and the corvette Benjamin. Terpsichore then had a succession of different commanders over the next five years. Captain John Mackellar took command in 1801, transferring from Jamaica, sailing Terpsichore to the East Indies in June that year with dispatches and a large quantity of specie.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 1, pp.218-20. In December Terpsichore was at Bombay undergoing repairs when the East India Company (EIC) Governor of the Bombay Presidency received a warning from the Portuguese authorities that they feared that the French were going to try and take Daman and Diu. was also undergoing repairs at Bombay so Mackellar volunteered his services. The EIC gave him command of the 48-gun Marquis Cornwallis, and a small flotilla consisting of the country ship , Betsey (an armed HEIC brig), some other vessels, and 1000 troops. The expedition sailed to Daman and Diu to persuade the Portuguese governor to resist any French incursion. The governor accepted the British reinforcements, which, as it turned out, were not needed. Then on 27 March 1802 the authorities in Bombay received news that the Governor, the Honourable Johnathan Duncan, while negotiating with local princes in Gujarat, had come under attack and had had to take refuge at Surat. The Political Department then instructed Mackelllar to take Terpsichore, , and two Indiamen, and sail to Goa. There he met with Sir William Clarke, who was conducting a siege of the city. Mackellar loaded 3000 troops from the siege and within seven days of leaving Bombay had arrived at Surat. The troops enabled Duncan to regain control of the area. Terpischore and Mackellar then returned to the siege of Goa. Mackellar was court- martialled on 20‚Äì26 May 1802 and dismissed the service for violating the Second (drunkenness and scandalous conduct) and Thirty-third (failure to follow orders while on shore) Articles of War. Napoleonic Wars Fleetwood Pellew commanding Terpsichore against Dutch vessels in Batavia Roads 24 November 1806 In 1803 Terpsichore came under Captain James Vashon, who was succeeded the following year by Captain Walter Bathurst. Bathurst captured the privateer Zephyr in the East Indies on 27 August 1804, before being succeeded in April 1805 by Captain Henry Lambert. Commander Joseph Bogue may have been in charge of Terpsichore until his death in July 1806, or possibly serving alongside Captain William Lye. Thereafter Terpsichore was commanded by several lieutenants in an acting capacity, starting with Lieutenant Augustus Collins in 1807, who captured the 12-gun Jaseur on 10 July 1807. Lieutenant William Wells took over later in 1807, and in 1808 command passed to Captain William Augustus Montagu. On 28 January 1808 Terpsichore was at Calcutta. News had been received of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Denmark. Captain Elliot of sent his boats, together with those of Terpsichore and up the Hooghly River to Serampore to seize the seven Danish merchant vessels there.Seton-Karr & Sandeman (1868), Vol. 4, p.196. S√©millante On 15 March 1808 Terpsichore was sailing some 60 miles off Ceylon when a mysterious sail was spotted coming up fast. The ship came up at 5.50 that evening, hoisted English colours and fired a shot, before changing tack. She fired a second shot at 6.45, at which Montagu hauled up and hove-to. As the strange ship approached, Montagu was able to determine her to be hostile, and Terpsichore opened fire, which was returned and a general action began. The enemy ship, which was the 40-gun French frigate under Captain L√©onard-Bernard Motard, closed at 7.10 and threw some combustible materials onto the deck, which caused a large explosion amongst boxes of powder. The explosion unmanned four guns and started fires, which the officers and men of Terpsichore struggled with but successfully extinguished. The two ships exchanged fire for sometime, each trying to manoeuvre into an advantageous position, until S√©millante ceased fire at 8 and bore round to escape. The reason for this was that S√©millante apparently suffered an explosion in a room near the magazine during the action. To reduce risk, the crew flooded the magazine, leaving her without usable powder, S√©millante had no choice but to break off the action with Terpsichore and return to port. Terpsichore had been badly damaged in her sails and rigging, but gave chase, and for the next four days pursued the fleeing French. By 20 March most of the damage to Terpsichore had been repaired, and she was fast closing on the French ship, under fire from her stern-chasers. The French eventually resorted to throwing overboard her boats, lumber, water and provisions and so S√©millante was finally able to pull away and escape her pursuers. Terpsichores losses were almost entirely caused by the explosion of the powder boxes, and amounted to one lieutenant and twenty men killed and twenty-two wounded, two of them mortally. At 2am in morning of the 20th, Terpsichore sighted a sail, which Montagu initially believed was S√©millante. However, the vessel turned out to be the brig Cadry, a prize to .Pi√©montaise had struck to on 8 March. Montagu put a prize crew on board Cadry and sent her into Madras. Terpsichore herself returned to Point de Galle.Asiatic Register, (1811), Vol. 10, pp.251-2. A report from √éle de France stated that the principle damage to S√©millante was due to an explosion in a room near the magazine, during the action. To reduce risk, the crew flooded the magazine; without usable powder, S√©millante had no choice but to attempt to break off the action with Terpsichore and return to port. S√©millante reportedly had five men killed and six wounded, including Motard, who may have had to have his arm amputated.Asiatic Register, (1811), Vol. 10, p.67. It is not clear from the report how many casualties were due to the action and how many to the explosion. S√©millante was so seriously damaged that the French removed her armament and decommissioned her on 10 July. During this action the future French Admiral Charles Baudin was severely wounded, losing an arm. Baudin recounts, in his memoirs, the kindnesses showed to him by an Englishwoman, wife of Captain Skene, master of the Gilwell, a prize S√©millante had taken earlier.\\"L'Amiral Baudin\\" by Jurien De La Gravi√®re, p.50 (590 on the file) to 53 (593) Return to England Terpsichore was refitted, and remained in the Indian Ocean until she returned to Britain with a convoy. On 15 February 1809 she sailed from Point de Galle with escorting a fleet of 15 East Indiamen bound for England. On 14 March, off Mauritius, a gale developed. Four of the ships, , , , and , parted company with the main convoy. They were never heard of again. Later years On her return to England, Terpsichore was fitted as a receiving ship at Chatham in December 1810. She spent between 1812 and 1813 laid up there in ordinary. She was at Portsmouth between 1814 and 1815, and spent her last years at Chatham between 1816 and 1829. She was broken up at Chatham in November 1830.

The commission was presided by Alexander Menshikov All those suspected of loyalty to Mazepa, including those who did not report to the Hlukhiv Rada council, were taken to Lebedin for torture and execution. Archbishop Konissky wrote: \\"The execution was a usual Menshikov's craft: wheeling and putting on a stake, but the easiest one, considered a child's play, was hanging and beheading. Their guilt was determined through their own confession, and the reliable means for that was the most glorious \\"sacrament\\" of the time - torture, of which postulates are still known to these days by this Russian proverb: \\"The whip is not an Angel: it won't remove the soul from the body, but shall compel the truth\\", and which tortures were carried out with the utmost accuracy and according to the instructions of the Assembly Code (Sobornoe Ulozhenie) in other words: step-by-step and in this order - first whip, then whip and splint i.e., hot iron, that was drawn gently and slowly over the flesh of a living man from which act he would seeth, and boil, and rise in agony. Whoever passed one test was next tried with another one, and all of them who could not stand it were declared guilty and led away to execution. In such a way, not overcoming the torture, suffered nine hundred people; this number is perhaps overstated, but, judging by the cemetery, segregated from the Christian one and known as Hetman Men's Cemetery], it may be concluded that not a small number of them were buried there\\". :Reliability of events (in particular, the number of executions) is the subject of debate.  Description  After Mazepa sided with the Swedes, Peter I issued a decree, which supposedly led to the torture and executions in Lebedin. \\"The decree for army sergeants who had left with the Swedes to Mazepa\\" from 1 November 1708 as: > \\"And those who by this Decree, having forgotten the fear of God and the Oath > to Us, the Great Tsar, and the wholeness and indivisibility of the > Motherland from him, the thief and traitor Mazepa, and from this enemy shall > not depart, and to Us, the Great Tsar, would not return in the course of > this month, i.e. by the 1st of December 1708, shall be declared our and our > Motherland's traitors.

At the same time in the \\"History of Ruthenians\\" there is no description of the location of the \\"grave of Hetman's people\\" and its size. About the torture and execution of the Cossacks in Lebedin, referring to the alleged author of \\"History of Ruthenians\\" Archbishop George Konissky of Belarus and legends preserved among the locals, writes Archbishop Filaret (Gumilevsky) in his book \\"Historical and statistical description of Kharkov diocese, \\"written in 1852-59: > \\" The most wonderful time for Lebedyn was the end of 1708 and beginning of > 1709.

History The frontier fort that became the settlement was built in 1767 by Andrew Donnally. Fort Donnally was the site of an attack by a large group of Indians in May 1778. The settlements were warned by two scouts from Point Pleasant named John Pryor and Philip Hammond (Hamman) who had volunteered to give warning to the Greenbriar settlements. The two scouts went from Point Pleasant to Fort Donnally on foot, being dressed to look like Indians by Nonhelema, the sister of Chief Cornstalk. Col. John Stuart came to the aid of the Fort the next day after the attack had begun, news of the attack having arrived by messenger to Lewisburg, then Fort Savannah.

The site was added to the National Register on 1976-06-17. History The site was once the location of a prehistoric village originally settled in the Archaic period and later by the Middle to Late Woodland people, as the discovery record has turned up projectile points and ceramics dating from those time periods.Pickenpaugh, Thomas E.; Stone Artifacts from the Brokaw Site; Ohio Archaeologist; 1976 The main village site is located on the relatively flat top of a hill roughly about above sea level. The site is estimated to encompass 2-3 acres. The site during its occupation overlooked a roughly-hewn hunting trail, later used as the outline of the first roads and eventually becoming National Road. This vantage point, plus the presence of four springs which flow downstream into a feeder creek of the Ohio River, made this site ideal for settlement. The property was bought by John Brokaw, who settled into a homestead on a part of the same hilltop. It was during his ownership that several artifacts were found, resulting in Brokaw authorizing a dig site during the years from 1972-1974. After extensive study, the investigating team approached Brokaw about placing the site on the National Register. Brokaw informed the team that the site was directly above a large coal seam and had already given permission for the strip mining of the area. However, the mining activity was delayed indefinitely as the site was eventually placed on the Register by the National Park Service. Today The entire hilltop was cleared around the start of the 20th century as evidenced by the bordering Locust and cherry trees in the fence lines and has been used as pasture and cultivation land. Much of the surrounding area has been radically transformed, as an ongoing housing development is slowly encroaching on the site and a reservoir was dug out east of the site.

The left-to-right gap, near the top of the contour map indicates a Fault line. This fault line is between the blue/green contour lines and the purple/red/yellow contour lines. The thin red circular contour line in the middle of the map indicates the top of the oil reservoir. Because gas floats above oil, the thin red contour line marks the gas/oil contact zone. In the oil and gas industry, reservoir modeling involves the construction of a computer model of a petroleum reservoir, for the purposes of improving estimation of reserves and making decisions regarding the development of the field, predicting future production, placing additional wells, and evaluating alternative reservoir management scenarios. A reservoir model represents the physical space of the reservoir by an array of discrete cells, delineated by a grid which may be regular or irregular. The array of cells is usually three- dimensional, although 1D and 2D models are sometimes used. Values for attributes such as porosity, permeability and water saturation are associated with each cell. The value of each attribute is implicitly deemed to apply uniformly throughout the volume of the reservoir represented by the cell. Types of reservoir model Reservoir models typically fall into two categories: * Geological models are created by geologists and geophysicists and aim to provide a static description of the reservoir, prior to production. * Reservoir simulation models are created by reservoir engineers and use finite difference methods to simulate the flow of fluids within the reservoir, over its production lifetime. Sometimes a single \\"shared earth model\\" is used for both purposes. More commonly, a geological model is constructed at a relatively high (fine) resolution. A coarser grid for the reservoir simulation model is constructed, with perhaps two orders of magnitude fewer cells. Effective values of attributes for the simulation model are then derived from the geological model by an upscaling process. Alternatively, if no geological model exists, the attribute values for a simulation model may be determined by a process of sampling geological maps. Uncertainty in the true values of the reservoir properties is sometimes investigated by constructing several different realizations of the sets of attribute values. The behaviour of the resulting simulation models can then indicate the associated level of economic uncertainty. The phrase \\"reservoir characterization\\" is sometimes used to refer to reservoir modeling activities up to the point when a simulation model is ready to simulate the flow of fluids. Commercially available software is used in the construction, simulation and analysis of the reservoir models.Stephen Tyson. An Introduction to Reservoir Modeling (2007), . Seismic to simulation The processes required to construct reservoir models are described by the phrase Seismic to simulation. The process is successful if the model accurately reflects the original well logs, seismic data and production history. Reservoir models are constructed to gain a better understanding of the subsurface that leads to informed well placement, reserves estimation and production planning. Models are based on measurements taken in the field, including well logs, seismic surveys, and production history. Seismic to simulation enables the quantitative integration of all field data into an updateable reservoir model built by a team of geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. Key techniques used in the process include integrated petrophysics and rock physics to determine the range of lithotypes and rock properties, geostatistical inversion to determine a set of plausible seismic-derived rock property models at sufficient vertical resolution and heterogeneity for flow simulation, stratigraphic grid transfer to accurately move seismic-derived data to the geologic model, and flow simulation for model validation and ranking to determine the model that best fits all the data. Rock physics and petrophysics The first step in seismic to simulation is establishing a relationship between petrophysical key rock properties and elastic properties of the rock. This is required in order to find common ground between the well logs and seismic data.\\"Benefits of Integrating Rock Physics with Petrophysics: Five Key Reasons to Employ an Integrated, Iterative Workflow\\", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2007. Well logs are measured in depth and provide high resolution vertical data, but no insight into the inter-well space. Seismic are measured in time and provide great lateral detail but is quite limited in its vertical resolution. When correlated, well logs and seismic can be used to create a fine-scale 3D model of the subsurface. Insight into the rock properties comes from a combination of basic geologic understanding and well-bore measurements. Based on an understanding of how the area was formed over time, geologists can predict the types of rock likely to be present and how rapidly they vary spatially. Well log and core measurements provide samples to verify and fine-tune that understanding. Seismic data is used by petrophysicists to identify the tops of various lithotypes and the distribution of rock properties in the inter-well space using seismic inversion attributes such as impedance. Seismic surveys measure acoustic impedance contrasts between rock layers. As different geologic structures are encountered, the sound wave reflects and refracts as a function of the impedance contrast between the layers. Acoustic impedance varies by rock type and can therefore be correlated to rock properties using rock physics relationships between the inversion attributes and petrophysical properties such as porosity, lithology, water saturation, and permeability. Once well logs are properly conditioned and edited, a petrophysical rock model is generated that can be used to derive the effective elastic rock properties from fluid and mineral parameters as well as rock structure information. The model parameters are calibrated by comparison of the synthetic to the available elastic sonic logs. Calculations are performed following a number of rock physics algorithms including: Xu & White, Greenberg & Castagna, Gassmann, Gardner, modified upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman, and Batzle & Wang. When the petrophysical rock model is complete, a statistical database is created to describe the rock types and their known properties such as porosity and permeability. Lithotypes are described, along with their distinct elastic properties. MCMC geostatistical inversion In the next step of seismic to simulation, seismic inversion techniques combine well and seismic data to produce multiple equally plausible 3D models of the elastic properties of the reservoir. Seismic data is transformed to elastic property log(s) at every trace. Deterministic inversion techniques are used to provide a good overall view of the porosity over the field, and serve as a quality control check. To obtain greater detail needed for complex geology, additional stochastic inversion is then employed.Francis, A., \\"Limitations of Deterministic and Advantages of Stochastic Seismic Inversion\\", CSEG Records, February 2005, p. 5-11. Geostatistical inversion procedures detect and delineate thin reservoirs otherwise poorly defined.Merletti, G., Torres-Verdin, C., \\"Accurate Detection and Spatial Delineation of Thin-Sand Sedimentary Sequences via Joint Stochastic Inversion of Well Logs and 3D Pre-Stack Seismic Amplitude Data\\", SPE 102444. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based geostatistical inversion addresses the vertical scaling problem by creating seismic derived rock properties with vertical sampling compatible to geologic models. All field data is incorporated into the geostatistical inversion process through the use of probability distribution functions (PDFs). Each PDF describes a particular input data in geostatistical terms using histograms and variograms, which identify the odds of a given value at a specific place and the overall expected scale and texture based on geologic insight. Once constructed, the PDFs are combined using Bayesian inference, resulting in a posterior PDF that conforms to everything that is known about the field.\\"Incorporating Geophysics into Geologic Models: New Approach Makes Geophysical Models Available to Engineers in a Form They Can Use\\", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2008. A weighting system is used within the algorithm, making the process more objective. From the posterior PDF, realizations are generated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. These realizations are statistically fair and produce models of high detail, accuracy and realism. Rock properties like porosity can be cosimulated from the elastic properties determined by the geostatistical inversion. This process is iterated until a best fit model is identified. Inversion parameters are tuned by running the inversion many times with and without well data. Without the well data, the inversions are running in blind- well mode. These blind-well mode inversions test the reliability of the constrained inversion and remove potential bias. This statistical approach creates multiple, equi-probable models consistent with the seismic, wells, and geology. Geostatistical inversion simultaneously inverts for impedance and discrete properties types, and other petrophysical properties such as porosity can then be jointly cosimulated. The output volumes are at a sample rate consistent with the reservoir model because making synthetics of finely sampled models is the same as from well logs. Inversion properties are consistent with well log properties because the histograms used to generate the output rock properties from the inversion are based on well log values for those rock properties. Uncertainty is quantified by using random seeds to generate slightly differing realizations, particularly for areas of interest. This process improves the understanding of uncertainty and risk within the model. Stratigraphic grid transfer Following geostatistical inversion and in preparation for history matching and flow simulation, the static model is re-gridded and up-scaled. The transfer simultaneously converts time to depth for the various properties and transfers them in 3D from the seismic grid to a corner-point grid. The relative locations of properties are preserved, ensuring data points in the seismic grid arrive in the correct stratigraphic layer in the corner point grid. The static model built from seismic is typically orthogonal but flow simulators expect corner point grids. The corner point grid consists of cubes that are usually much coarser in the horizontal direction and each corner of the cube is arbitrarily defined to follow the major features in the grid. Converting directly from orthogonal to corner point can cause problems such as creating discontinuity in fluid flow. An intermediate stratigraphic grid ensures that important structures are not misrepresented in the transfer. The stratigraphic grid has the same number of cells as the orthogonal seismic grid, but the boundaries are defined by stratigraphic surfaces and the cells follow the stratigraphic organization. This is a stratigraphic representation of the seismic data using the seismic interpretation to define the layers. The stratigraphic grid model is then mapped to the corner point grid by adjusting the zones. Using the porosity and permeability models and a saturation height function, initial saturation models are built. If volumetric calculations identify problems in the model, changes are made in the petrophysical model without causing the model to stray from the original input data. For example, sealing faults are added for greater compartmentalization. Model validation and ranking In the last step of seismic to simulation, flow simulation continues the integration process by bringing in the production history. This provides a further validation of the static model against history. A representative set of the model realizations from the geostatistical inversion are history matched against production data. If the properties in the model are realistic, simulated well bottom hole pressure behavior should match historical (measured) well bottom hole pressure.Castoro A., de Groot L. , Forsyth D., Maguire R., Rijkers R., Webber R., \\"Accurate Reservoir Modelling Through Optimized Integration of Geostatistical Inversion And Flow Simulation. A North Sea Case Study\\", Petex, 2008. Production flow rates and other engineering data should also match. Based on the quality of the match, some models are eliminated. After the initial history match process, dynamic well parameters are adjusted as needed for each of the remaining models to improve the match. The final model represents the best match to original field measurements and production data and is then used in drilling decisions and production planning.

Biography Born into a family of immigrants from Tuscany, Italy, he lived in Campinas until he was 10 years old, when his father, a master carpenter, moved with his wife and children to the state capital, S√£o Paulo, where he hoped to find better working conditions. One year later, Jos√© and one of his sisters moved to Italy, to live under the care of an uncle and grandparents. In Italy Arriving at the house of his uncle Casimiro, he started to study at the Salesian College in Massa-Carrara. But shortly thereafter, Italy became involved in World War I and Pancetti had to be moved to the countryside home of his grandparents in the town of Pietrasanta. There, he learned the craft of a carpenter in a small workshop. But he did not like the routine of the job and thus went to work, always briefly, in factories until the war ended. Wishing to fix a better job for Jos√©, his uncle arranged for him to be a sailor in the Italian merchant navy, where he learned the seafaring profession. He boarded the \\"Maria Rosa\\" sailboat, which ran trips throughout the Mediterranean, especially between the ports of Genoa and Alexandria. But he later left the ship to go wandering the streets of Genoa, until someone took him to the Brazilian consulate, which provided for his return to Brazil. Back in Brazil Thus, on February 12, 1920, he landed in Santos. To survive, he worked in different places and different crafts until, in 1921, he moved to S√£o Paulo again, where a businessman, also of Italian origin, offered him a job as a painter of walls and posters, which seems to have been his first contact with painting. In that same year, the painter Adolfo Fonzari offered to Pancetti an opportunity to assist him in decorating the house of another Italian in the coast of Guaruj√°. Then, in 1922, Pancetti enlisted into the Brazilian Navy, where he was to remain for 24 years, until 1946. The discovery of painting Aboard the Navy ships, Pancetti was given the task of painting hulls, walls, etc. He did this with such a zeal that his fame spread throughout the Navy until an admiral created a cadre of experts in the profession and appointed Pancetti as its first teacher of painting. But being a wall painter became boring and upon the humble sailor dawned a desire to put into paper what his eyes saw. And so Pancetti began to draw and to paint postcards with landscapes, seascapes and romantic sceneries, still quite clumsy, but which already showed his considerable artistic potential. During the S√£o Paulo Constitutional Revolution of 1932, Pancetti watched and painted a scene depicting a warplane downed by machine guns of the cruiser \\"Rio Grande do Sul\\" on board of which he was. The painting was acquired and published by the weekly \\"Noite Ilustrada\\", and that how he was professionally started in the fine arts. In 1933, while walking through the Campo de Santana in Rio de Janeiro, he observed a painter in his chores to capture the city's landscape, so rich in wonderful scenery to offer. The man seemed friendly and pleasant enough and this encouraged him to strike up a conversation by asking about the painting and confessing his desire to learn to paint. The artist was Giuseppe Gargaglione, who advised him to seek the N√∫cleo Bernardelli, a free painting school that operated in the building of the Rio de Janeiro School of Fine Arts. Pancetti accepted the suggestion and was admitted to the N√∫cleo, where his main advisor was painter Bruno Lechowski. At N√∫cleo Bernardelli Two years later, in 1935, Pancetti married Anita Caruso, with whom he had two children. His recognition as a painter began in 1933, with a participation at the Sal√£o Nacional de Belas Artes (National Fine Arts Exhibition). He was invited again in 1934, 1936, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1947 and 1948. In 1941 he was awarded one of the prizes, which gave out an educational trip to Europe. His first solo exhibition took place 10 years later, only, in 1945, featuring more than 70 of his paintings. His first international exhibition took place in 1950 at the Venice Biennale. The following year, he was accepted at the first International Art Biennial of Art S√£o Paulo, having participated also in the third biennial (1955). Death Unfortunately, Pancetti, uncle of Isaurinha Garcia, one of the most popular singers of Brazil in the 1940s and 50s, suffered from tuberculosis. He spent some time in the spa cities of Campos do Jord√£o and S√£o Jo√£o del Rei, seeking a rest cure. He died in 1958 in the Naval Hospital of Rio de Janeiro and was laid to rest in the S√£o Jo√£o Batista cemetery in the quarter of Botafogo. Assessment Pancetti specialized in painting mostly seascape (\\"marinhas\\", in Portuguese) and is notable for that, but he also liked to paint still life, landscape, figure and portrait painting. While living, Pancetti enjoyed a relatively late recognition. His production was not very prolific, so his paintings are rare and in the hands mostly of private collectors. After his death, his fame grew very much, and his paintings are highly valued and command one of the best selling prices among Brazilian modernist painters, nowadays. Indicative would be prices in 2017 of around USD 80,000 to about 250,000 for his seascapes whilst a portrait or a still-life might only attract from less than 10,000 to less than 50,000.> Artistas > Cota√ß√µes > Jos√© Pancetti, Bolsa de Arte (per 11 November 2017).

It typically has five arms, with the center disk of the animal being much wider than the stubby arms are in length. Although the bat star usually has five arms, it sometimes has as many as nine. Bat stars occur in many colors, including green, purple, red, orange, yellow and brown, either mottled or solid. The bat star gets its name from the webbing between its arms, which is said to resemble a bat's wings. The bat star is usually found in the intertidal zone to a depth of . Its range extends from Sitka, Alaska to Baja California in the Pacific Ocean. It is most abundant along the coast of Central California and the Monterey Bay. Classification The genus of this species has transitioned back and forth between Asterina and Patiria since its inclusion in Fisher's 1911 North Pacific Asteroidea monograph.https://archive.org/details/bulletinunitedst7611911unit However, recent revisions based on molecular systematics have constrained Asterina and identified Patiria as a complex of three closely related species in the Pacific, including P. miniata, P. pectinifera in Asia and P. chilensis in South America.http://www.marinespecies.org/Asteroidea/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=123285 Anatomy Bat stars can be many different types of colors. The bat star breathes through gill-like structures on its back that perform as respirators. It lacks the pincers or pedicellariae that most starfish use to clean the skin surface of debris, but its small, moving hairs or cilia may create enough of a water current to keep the surface of its skin clean. It has visual sensors at the end of each ray that can detect light and note prey. To eat its prey, it covers the prey with its stomach and oozes digestive juices over it; this liquefies the food, enabling the bat star to ingest it. It is omnivorous, eating both plants and animals alive or dead. Reproduction Bat star bipinnaria at fourth day of development Photographed using confocal microscopy. Histones are labeled in blue, actin filaments in orange. The bat stars reproduce through spawning. The male casts sperm and the female drops eggs; each has pores at the base of the rays for this purpose. The sperm and egg unite at sea and are carried away by ocean currents. Behavior Bat stars may gently \\"fight\\" with each other if they meet. Fighting behavior consists of pushing and laying an arm over the other. Bat stars are important as detritivores and scavengers, collecting algae and dead animals from the ocean floor.

Truman on September 6, 1945, which governed US policy in the occupation of Japan following surrender in the Second World War. It was released to the public on September 22. Background The document titled \\"US Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan\\" was drafted by the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee, and approved by that committee on August 29, 1945, and its official designation was SWNCC 150/4. It was approved by the president on September 6, and released to the media on September 22.text in Department of State Bulletin, September 23, 1945, pp. 423-427 Provisions of the document The document set two main objectives for the occupation. \\"The ultimate objectives of the United States in regard to Japan, to which policies in the initial period must conform, are: #(a) To insure that Japan will not again become a menace to the United States or to the peace and security of the world. #(b) To bring about the eventual establishment of a peaceful and responsible government which will respect the rights of other states and will support the objectives of the United States as reflected in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The United States desires that this government should conform as closely as may be to principles of democratic self-government but it is not the responsibility of the Allied Powers to impose upon Japan any form of government not supported by the freely expressed will of the people.\\" The document also set four main policies to be pursued: # Japanese sovereignty only to include the four main Japanese islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, while the fate of additional islands was to be determined later (this provision was taken from the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945). # Japan was to be disarmed, and the military was not to play any important role in Japanese society in the future. # The Japanese society was to be encouraged to develop personal liberties, such as freedoms of religion, assembly, speech, and the press, as well as to develop democratically elected institutions. # The Japanese economy was to be developed for peaceful purposes. The document stipulated the occupation was to last until these objectives were to be met, without specifying time limit. Practical control was vested in the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), appointed by the US, a post given to General Douglas MacArthur. Other Allied governments were only given symbolic participation in policy making over Japan. The Japanese government was retained along with the Emperor, but were subjected to SCAP. The document established freedom of speech and freedom of religion as basic principles, and also prohibited religious and racial discrimination. Two issues the document referred to were the issue of free elections and the demand for the dissolution of the big businesses then controlling the Japanese economy. The document did not require any policy on these issues, but called upon SCAP to encourage the Japanese government to take steps on these matters. This non-committal attitude on free elections and corporate control derived from the view of Japanese society as over conservative and not very susceptible to change.Juha Saunavaara, \\"Occupation Authorities, the Hatoyama Purge and the Making of Japan‚Äôs Postwar Political Order\\" The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol. 39-2-09, September 28, 2009 Aftermath The US Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan became an official legal document for the conduct of Japanese affairs during the occupation. Following the establishment of the Allied Council for Japan in December 1945, it was charged with drafting a joint Allied occupation statute for Japan, to be based on the same document. However, opposition among Allied governments to approve a statute that gave the US government the dominant position led to delays, and the new statute was finally approved on June 19, 1947.

Also known as the Global Marine House, it was declared a historic cultural monument in 1974. Architecture The building was designed by the architects Albert Raymond Walker (1881‚Äì1958) and Percy Augustus Eisen (1885‚Äì1946) in 1927. It is a compact twelve-storey block on an H-shaped plan with a facing of smooth and squared slabs of light-colored stone. Fa√ßade The first three stories present a striking fa√ßade with a trapezoidal profile. The building‚Äôs streetside elevation is divided into three horizontal registers that echo the classic arrangement of a Renaissance palace in distinct lower, central and upper sections. As in Italian antiquity, the section closest to the viewer is given the greatest architectural definition. The fa√ßade's central axis is emphasized by a large entrance portal, with a rounded arch that rises the height of two storeys. This deep, splayed passageway has an arched lintel decorated with plant motifs that introduces serried ranks of arches on either side. They are resting alternately on small columns and pillars variously decorated with fantastic creatures and inlaid geometric patterns. The wall beneath the great arch is densely worked with volutes of acanthus leaves and concatenated circles simulating rope made entirely of terracotta reliefs. The entrance is divided in two by a column of green marble with a capital and decorated entablature on which the two smaller arches rest. Echoes of the architecture of the temple and the religious edifice return boldly in the three uppermost storeys, with a double order of arches on spiral columns, capitals decorated with foliage, and keystones with small animal heads. A tympanum with a curious internal colonnade crowns the fa√ßade in a riot of minute decoration and majestic architectural sculpture groups. Interior The two-storey interior lobby is set in large wall arches that enclose smaller arches on brackets at the lower level. A large balcony-type gallery is above, with spaces designed for artists‚Äô studios. It is modelled on the matroneum overlooking the nave of a church. A shallow pool adorned with bronze sculptures, by the sculptor Burt Johnson, reflects light in the center of the lobby. The lobby walls are decorated with ceramic relief panels, small sculptural inserts, and seventeen showcases made of glass and finely chased bronze like reliquaries. They now display a tenants‚Äô paintings, sculptures and artworks. History Oil wildcatter Russell E.

National Register Multiple Property Nomination, Salt Lake City, 2000. Architectural style The design of the meetinghouse came from Niels Edward Liljenberg, a Swedish- American architect. It is significant as a well-preserved example of a meetinghouse influenced by the Gothic Revival style, a popular style for Mormon meetinghouses in the Salt Lake Valley during the first decade of the twentieth century. The original architectural features are still evident, the fenestration patterns as well as the size of the openings have not been modified, and there have been very few alterations. The Murray Second Ward represents not only the growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and development of the Murray community, but the building is also an excellent example of the influence of the Gothic style in LDS Church architecture. Influences During the first decade of the twentieth century, the English parish style became the model for many LDS meetinghouses including the Murray Second Ward. This style was concurrent with the resurgence of medieval influence in American architecture. As the LDS Church wanted to follow current trends in architecture professionally trained architects were employed to design new buildings. The popularity of the Victorian Gothic influence in American architecture happened to coincide with the LDS Church's program to build new meetinghouses. These typical Gothic- style influenced meetinghouses are characterized generally by either an asymmetrical or symmetrical facade which is dominated by a square Norman architecture-style entrance tower; Gothic or Romanesque arches or a combination of the two, are used throughout the building. The Murray Second Ward Meetinghouse fits this description well; it has an asymmetrical facade dominated by an entrance tower with a crenellated parapet, and tall, Gothic (pointed) arch windows framed in wood tracery. First meetinghouse The first LDS or Mormon meetinghouse in Murray was built in 1856. As in most pioneer LDS communities, the first meetinghouse was vernacular classical in style and was built with the nearest and most available materials. It was understood that in time, a larger, more substantial facility would replace this first building. In communities that did not have a temple or tabernacle, the ward meetinghouse was the primary physical symbol of their relationship to God; it was a common element within the Mormon concept of sacred space. Scandinavian ward Many of the men employed at the Franklyn and Germania smelters were immigrants from Scandinavian countries who had joined the LDS church in their homeland and moved to Utah; most spoke very little English. In 1883 Bishop Rawlins of the South Cottonwood Ward allowed the Scandinavian population to hold separate services in the Swedish language. At first the group met in the homes of various members; by 1893 the group had built a small wood frame meetinghouse located \\"west of the state road\\". This became known as the \\"unofficial\\" Scandinavian Ward. Murray ward organized On October 28, 1900, the Murray Ward was formally organized as an outgrowth of the South Cottonwood Ward, and Uriah G. Miller was appointed as the first Bishop. Six years later, on March 4, 1906, the ward was divided, creating the Murray First Ward and Murray Second Ward; Jacob E. Erekson was Bishop of the Second Ward. The geographic boundaries of the Murray Second Ward included the area west of the Oregon Short Line Railroad tracks to the Jordan River, and between the north and south Murray City limits. New meetinghouse built The newly created Second Ward held their meetings in the twenty foot by thirty-five foot wood frame meetinghouse built by the Scandinavians in 1893. Almost immediately, steps were taken towards establishing a new meetinghouse. On September 10, 1906, a one and one-half acre parcel was purchased from Peter Adamson for $400.00; the property was located on the west side of Second West Street (now Third West Street). In 1909, the new brick meetinghouse was completed; it was formally dedicated in 1911. With seating, fixtures and musical instruments, the price of the new facility came to $13,000.00. The floor plan is in the shape of a T; the stem of the T (or front) was used for assembly and services, while \\"amusements\\" were located in the (rear) section perpendicular to the chapel.Manuscript History & General Minutes for the Murray Second Ward, LDS Church archives. The old \\"Scandinavian\\" meetinghouse continued to be used as a storage facility. According to a 1933 Stake Report, during the months of November and December the chapel, amusement hall and classrooms were renovated. The exterior wood trim was painted, and the interior wood trim was re-varnished. The ceiling in the auditorium was painted, and the walls and ceilings in the chapel and amusement hall were replaced, painted and \\"starched\\". The walls in the classrooms were \\"re- calcimined\\", the boiler was overhauled and new flues were installed, and new linoleum flooring was laid in the front entrance hall. Sale of former meetinghouse In 1956, the boundaries of the ward were changed no doubt due to growth in the population of Murray. Beginning in 1970, proposals were made for construction of a new meetinghouse. In 1977 the building was sold to the current owners, the Alano Club. The Alano Club is a not-for-profit non- denominational support agency for recovering alcoholics and their families.

V√©zina is buried in the Cimeti√®re Notre-Dame-de-Belmont in Sainte- Foy. Early life V√©zina, born in 1849, was the son of Fran√ßois V√©zina, a house painter and amateur musician who taught his son to play the piano. As a youngster, V√©zina briefly studied under Calixa Lavall√©e but, for the most part, he was a self-taught musician. Career V√©zina's work as a musician began in military bands. In 1867, he joined the Voltigeurs de Qu√©bec and played the baritone horn for the Voltigeurs band. He took over the duty of bandmaster in 1868 and held it until 1879. V√©zina later went on to found and direct a number of military, amateur and professional orchestras, most notably the Orchestre Symphonique de Qu√©bec (1902-until his death). On June 24, 1880, he conducted the first performance of O Canada which eventually became Canada's national anthem. V√©zina was also an accomplished composer. His work includes three op√©ra comique: Le Laur√©at (1906) ‚Äî libretto by F√©lix-Gabriel Marchand ‚Äî Le Rajah (1910) and Le F√©tiche (1912). He died before completing a fourth opera: La Grosse Gerbe, adapted from a poem of L√©on-Pamphile Le May. Throughout his career, V√©zina's work as a teacher, musician, conductor, composer and active champion for his art made him the central figure in Quebec City's cultural life. He helped found the music school of Laval University in 1922 and taught there until his death. His notable pupils included Henri Gagnon and Robert Talbot.

Though originally composed for Lute-Harpsichord (Lautenwerck) it has since been adapted for various instruments, including lute, piano and guitar. It is a pedagogical work much in the spirit of The Well-Tempered Clavier, with which it shares musical characteristics. The piece's true authorship fell into question for decades before being proven to be Bach's by publication of Hans Neemann‚Äôs J. S. Bach Lautenkompositionen (1931).  History  Lute- harpsichord The piece's exact year of creation is the subject of extensive speculation. The Oxford Dictionary of Music cites the prelude's similarity to the Well-Tempered Clavier (most notably, the sixteenth-note broken chord patterns anchored by a pedal tone ), stating, \\"c minor bwv999 shows an affinity with the ‚Äò48‚Äô, and may thus belong to the C√∂then or early Leipzig period\\". However, indirect sources, such as IMSLP and Classical Music Archives, place its origin at 1725 and 1720, respectively. These estimates also conflict with the more direct motival parallels between BWV 999 and Prelude and Fugue in C Major, BWV 846, which Bach penned in 1722. As Bach left Weimar to become Kapellmeister at C√∂then in 1717, and departed C√∂then to take his position as cantor and music director in Leipzig in 1723, the uncertainty of dates (wherein the piece was composed between 1717 and 1723) can place it in any one of three locations within Bach's compositional timeline. Initially, analysts were unsure as to whether the prelude was actually composed by Bach, since the only original source discovered was a copy by one of Bach's pupils, Johann Peter Kellner (1705‚Äì1772). Analysis contained within Neemann‚Äôs J. S. Bach Lautenkompositionen (1931) later confirmed the authorship.  Prelude genre  BWV 999's brief, introductory nature (43 measures), improvisatory feel and reiteration of a defining motif fits squarely within the prelude genre of the 1710s and 1720s. Additionally, the shortness of the motif itself follows the conventions of early sixteenth-century prelude. It also served a teaching purpose characteristic of the genre, widely using arpeggiations and technical demands that served students well as an √©tude. Barbara Russano Hanning describes prelude features and goals: \\"The typical prelude assigns the player a specific task, so that the piece functions as an etude. In addition, the preludes illustrate different types of keyboard performance conventions and compositional practices.\\" Such pedagogical traits contribute to the work's longevity; it is still an oft-used educational tool.  Musical characteristics   Motif  Measures 1‚Äì7 of BWV 999 Prelude in C Minor is set in time. Its central motif consists of intersecting rhythms between the upper and lower voice (what originally would have been the left and right hand). In the right hand, this is a sixteenth rest, followed by a seven-note sixteenth passage that typically arpeggiates an inversion of a triad (ascending and descending from and back to the root), and an alternating sixteenth rest‚Äìsixteenth note pattern in the third beat. The left participates by having a pedal tone quarter in the first beat, a rest, then two eighth notes.  Harmony  Measures 8‚Äì14 (modulation occurring in mm. 11‚Äì14 is highlighted]). Contrary to its title and key signature, less than a third of BWV 999 is actually written in C minor. In measure 11, a Secondary leading- tone chord is employed (namely, a diminished F seventh chord) to modulate and lead the ear to G minor, the dominant of the original key. Aside from a turn to G major (mm. 34‚Äì38 and 42‚Äì43), and the reemergence of C minor (mm. 39‚Äì41), G minor tonality dominates the piece. Early on, the upper voice is repeated over several measures, with the left hand providing the only shifting harmonic background. For example, measures 8‚Äì10 are exactly the same in the right hand, but descending tones in the left hand create an expansion of tonic harmony.

McCormack is best known for her role as Rhoda Penmark in the 1956 film The Bad Seed. The film also stars Sarah Jane Miller, Rachel Lemieux, Jason Miller, Brinke Stevens, Michael Cornelison, Mark Spellman, Majel Barrett Mickey Spillane, Marian Wald, Janelle Vanerstrom, Judith Meyers, Nathan Collins, Tom Castillo, and Tom Summit. Plot Mrs Sterling is a middle-aged single mother of a 12-year-old daughter ‚Äì Jessica Ann ‚Äì who is a student at McKinley Elementary School. At the beginning of the film, Mrs Sterling visits the school to meet with Mrs Withers, Jessica Ann‚Äôs teacher. Jessica Ann has repeatedly won previous Student Of The Year awards, but Mrs Withers has decided to award the prize this year to another student- a decision which Mrs Sterling takes exception to, believing the choice to be based on the fact that nominee Eduardo Melendez is Hispanic. After Mrs Withers refuses to change her mind about the award, Mrs Sterling pushes her off a stepladder and then breaks her neck with her bare hands. After Mrs Sterling tells Jessica Ann that she found her teacher dead, the police arrive led by detective Lt. March who immediately suspects that the death may not be accidental. After interviewing Mrs Sterling he tells her he will be in touch and implies he suspects her involvement. Mrs Sterling has previously been married twice- first to Jessica Ann‚Äôs father and then to her second husband Mr Sterling. Jessica Ann reveals, via voiceover, that her mother may have married Mr Sterling to gain access to his finances, although he was not as rich as she first thought. Upon returning home, Jessica Ann is comforted by her Aunt Beth who later reveals to her that Jessica Ann‚Äôs mother is possibly not stable and unable to have the same emotions as others, although she loves her daughter very much. Mrs Sterling‚Äôs new partner- Mark Jeffries- arrives home. Unbeknownst to Mrs Sterling, Jessica Ann and Beth, Mark is an insurance investigator determined to find out the truth about Mr Sterling‚Äôs death and has begun an intimate relationship with Jessica Ann‚Äôs mother to determine the truth. The next day at school, Jessica Ann is questioned by Lt March who reveals the medical examiner determined Mrs Withers died of a broken neck, but that the injury was sustained after she fell off the ladder. Jessica Ann flashes back to dinner the previous evening where she noticed her mother opening a jar with an extremely tough grip and starts to think she may, in some way, be responsible for her teacher‚Äôs death. Lt. March also reveals that the Student of the Year plaque is missing and whoever has it may know the truth about Mrs Withers‚Äô death. Jessica Ann also has a brief confrontation with the school janitor, Ms Jones, who implies that she witnessed Mrs Sterling killing Mrs Withers. Jessica Ann, later that same day, reveals to her mother about what Ms Jones has insinuated. Realising that the janitor may reveal the truth to the police, Mrs Sterling tells Jessica Ann she is going to the store to get some coffee and a rental tape, but in reality visits the school when it is dark. Confronting Ms Jones, who suggests she will blackmail her, she eventually electrocutes her by throwing a pail of water over the janitor near the school‚Äôs fuse board in the basement. Meanwhile, Jessica Ann finds the Student of the Year plaque in her mother's bedroom and realizes that she killed Mrs Withers. Ms Jones‚Äô death is revealed the following morning at school by the Principal Mrs Evans. Jessica Ann starts to think she is responsible for causing the death by telling her mother about the threats Ms Jones was making. That evening, Mrs Sterling and Mark go out for a society dinner-dance together whilst Beth babysits. Beth tries to get Jessica Ann to open up, but she is reluctant to implicate her mother any further. Whilst using the restroom at the dinner-dance, Lt March confronts Mark and reveals he knows the truth about his background and that he may be getting too close to comfort with Mrs Sterling. Mark angrily rebuffs his suggestions and walks out. Later that same night, Mark receives a telephone call from his employers which is overheard by Jessica Ann. When Mark tries to explain his position to Jessica Ann in her bedroom, Mrs Sterling walks in with a loaded pistol and shoots Mark several times in the head and chest. Jessica Ann is upset, but goes along with her mother‚Äôs suggestion that they lie to the police about Mark attempting to molest her. After an unproductive night of questioning, Lt. March suggests to Beth that she should look after Jessica Ann but when she attempts to do just that, she is kicked out of the house by Mrs Sterling. After a brief meeting with Lt. March and her attorney, Eckhardt, Mrs Sterling realizes that she faces the very real possibility of being convicted for Mark‚Äôs death and decides to skip town with Jessica Ann. Arriving at a motel several hours away from their home, Jessica Ann goes to sleep but has a nightmare of Mark rising from the dead and warning her about her mother‚Äôs mental state. Mrs Sterling attempts to strangle Jessica Ann, but she escapes just in time. Running to a disused junkyard, Jessica attempts to hide from her mother, although when both are confronted by a guard dog, Mrs Sterling steps in to protect her daughter, being savaged in the process. Surviving, she is about to strangle Jessica Ann when Lt. March and Beth arrive on the scene. Mrs Sterling is arrested and taken away by Lt. March whilst Beth takes Jessica Ann into her care.

All of the film was shot primarily on location in Muscatine, Iowa (Collins' home town), which aided the casting of the killer's daughter. Then 11-year-old Rachel Lemieux had no prior professional acting experience; she was discovered at an open audition in an Iowa mall and beat out more than 200 girls for the role. A number of other finalists for the role ended up as extras in classroom scenes which were filmed on location at Muscatine Middle School. Max Allan Collins later revealed in the 2020 director's commentary that he initially planned on just being the film's producer but difficulties with the original director eventually left him with little choice but to take over that aspect of the film as well. Collins also revealed that the original director wanted an \\"older, more shapely\\" actress as Jessica Ann, whilst he himself favoured Rachel Lemieux and that it was this contentious point that resulted in a change of directors on the film. The filming of Mommy was covered by Entertainment Tonight in a segment anchored by Leonard Maltin. There had been little interest in Muscatine as a filming location up until this point, so many of the local businesses were keen to support the production including the local professional photographer and the company that made the plaque for the 'Student Of The Year' award. Despite the relatively low budget, the cast had a large number of well-known actors including Patty McCormack as the lead, Mickey Spillane as her attorney, Jason Miller as the investigating lieutenant and Majel Barrett as Jessica's school teacher at the start of the picture. Director Collins' son Nate appears in this film and its sequel in a small role as the Gleeful Kid. Former 'scream queen' Brinke Stevens was cast as the sister of Patty McCormack's character; she was an acquaintance of writer/director Max Allan Collins, whom he had met while the two were making personal appearances at comic book conventions. When asked about her involvement with the film, Collins commented, \\"Brinke was happy to have a chance to do something with her clothes on, I think.\\" Mickey Spillane was a personal friend of writer/director Max Allan Collins and appeared in the movie as a favor. When Spillane arrived to film his part, he was ill and running a dangerously high fever. Concerned for his health, crew members tried to talk him out of filming, but he insisted on going on with the show. Despite his illness, Spillane completed all his filming and returned in better health for the sequel. The film was initially sold to LifeTime movies on cable and was able to recoup its initial investment through additional sales. It was later released on DVD and, in 2020, as a 25th Anniversary double DVD/blu-ray package with its sequel. Reception Critics hailed McCormack's performance and deemed the film as an \\"unofficial sequel\\" to her 1956 film The Bad Seed. Sequel The film spawned a sequel in 1997, with McCormack reprising her role as Mrs. Sterling in Mommy 2: Mommy's Day.

Following this observation, Paris Constantinides MD Vienna, Austria and PhD Montreal, Canada who was the first to discover that the junctions between endothelial cells that line human atheromatous plaques are open in contrast to closed junctions over the normal arterial intima, in an editorial in the journal ‚ÄúCirculation‚Äù raised the possibility that ‚Äúeven ordinary reactions could promote plaque disruption‚Äù.

He lives in Patras, Achaia, Greece with his wife, daughter, son and a grandson. Research His description of Kounis syndrome, denoting for the first time a hypersensitivity blow up inside the coronary, cerebral and mesenteric arteries, might have profound clinical and therapeutic implications because he discovered that the same mediators, released during acute allergic episodes, are increased in blood or urine of patients suffering from acute coronary syndromes of nonallergic etiology.Sakata V, Komamura K, Hirayama A, et al.

Career Hotel Europa Palace (Anacapri), Paolo Monti, 1963 Frattini opened his own professional practice in Milan, after having worked in the office of his teacher and mentor Gi√≤ Ponti. Frattini became an industrial designer by default when he lacked appropriate lighting and furniture for his interiors. His collaboration with Cesare Cassina for his namesake company started in 1954, followed by collaborations with many other manufacturers, such as Bernini, Arteluce, Acerbis, Fantoni, Artemide (for whom among others pieces with Livio Castiglioni he designed the historic Boalum lamp), Luci, Knoll, Lema and many others. In 1956 he co-founded Associazione per il Disegno Industriale and throughout his career he practiced both industrial design and architecture, focusing mostly on interiors. He was a board member of the Triennale. Great connoisseur of wood craftsmanship, he forged a long and fruitful professional partnership with the master craftsman from Bovisio Masciago (Milan), Pierluigi Ghianda. Glassware designed by Gianfranco Frattini for Progetti is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art and the Boalum lamp (with Livio Castiglioni) produced by Artemide is in the collection of the Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.

It was built by the Halberstadt-Blankenburg railway (HBE) between 1880 and 1886. The route length is 30.6 kilometres, the height difference over 300 metres. The seven kilometre long section from K√∂nigsh√ºtte to Tanne was closed in 1968 and the five kilometres from Elbingerode to K√∂nigsh√ºtte followed suit on 30 August 2000, the last train to K√∂nigsh√ºtte having run in 1999. The name R√ºbeland Railway was first used when the railway was nationalised. Previously it had been known as the Harz Railway (Harzbahn). The line is notable for using 25 kV AC railway electrification, resulting in its use as a railway test track for trains built in Germany that needed to be tested before export.  Route  The R√ºbeland Railway has a backshunt (Spitzkehre) in Michaelstein and several ramp sections with inclines of 60 ‚Ä∞. In addition to the junction with the South Harz Railway in Tanne the R√ºbeland Railway was linked via a branch line with the Harzquerbahn and Brocken Railways, that ran from Wechsel station to Drei Annen Hohne. This line was closed in 1963 and the track was later lifted, but the trackbed left in place. As a result, it was able to be rebuilt without the need for planning permission.  History   Since nationalisation  On 1 January 1950 the Halberstadt-Blankenburg Railway, which had been nationalised in 1946, was taken over by the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn. Between 1960 and 1965 the R√ºbeland Railway was electrified, in order to be able to transport the raw material, lime, in larger quantities from the quarries near R√ºbeland. The power system used for this isolated network was not the usual German, single- phase, electrification system, 15 kV AC, 16 2/3 Hz, but single-phase, 25 kV AC, 50 Hz railway electrification, which was taken from the 110-kV state electricity network at a substation at the exit to Blankenburg with the aid of transformers. On 1 August 1966 electrical operations began and since then the DR Class E 251, specially built for the R√ºbeland Railway, has been used on this line. The section from Hornberg junction to K√∂nigsh√ºtte was closed in 2000, goods services having ceased on 2 June 1996 and the last passenger train between Elbingerode and K√∂nigsh√ºtte having run on 29 May 1999. The service was minimal; passenger trains usually consisted of a locomotive and only one or two coaches. The section to the Hornberg Lime Works is still worked by goods trains. These trains, with a maximum of 600 tonnes of towing capacity uphill and 1,500 tonnes downhill are each hauled by a train locomotive and a pusher locomotive which avoids a backshunt at Michaelstein station. In 2005 current to the catenary was switched off. On 12 July 2005 the section from Blankenburg to Elbingerode was put out to tender by DB Netz AG. Passenger services were cancelled by the state of Saxony-Anhalt on 11 December 2005 on the last remaining still operational section between Blankenburg and Elbingerode. On 1 May 2006 the Fels-Werke company leased the line with an option to purchase. The DB Netz AG handed the line over in working condition to the new operator, Fels Netz GmbH. From that point the Havell√§ndische Eisenbahn (HVLE), who had already paid for most of the goods traffic since 2005, took over the remaining transport operations previously run by Railion. Currently the route is operated by dispatchers (Zugleitbetrieb)(as at 2009). Since 2003 it has been upgraded at a cost of 2.4 million euros, of which 800,000 euros were funded by the state. Because many people who lived along the line of the R√ºbeland Railway protested against diesel running due to the noise and exhaust emissions of diesel locomotives, the state of Saxony-Anhalt wanted to fund electrical goods train operations to the tune of 450,000 euros. In summer 2007 the platforms in R√ºbeland station were refurbished. The station buildings in H√ºttenrode and K√∂nigsh√ºtte had to be demolished due to their state of disrepair. H√ºttenrode station was kept open, the backshunt station at Michaelstein was given new spring-loaded points. In January 2008 the catenary between the Hornberg Lime Works siding and the station of K√∂nigsh√ºtte was dismantled. The Elbingerode‚ÄìHornberg Lime Works section is still worked on demand. In 2008 1.7 million tonnes of lime and limestone were transported.  Re-opening of electrical operationsUwe Behmann: The R√ºbelndbahn f√§hrt wieder mit 50 Hz. In: Eisenbahn-Revue International 2009, S. 432 - 437.  In 2007 the catenary masts and some of the overhead wire and feeder cables were replaced. As a result, after a two-year break, electric trains are able to run again. Due to a lack of locomotives suitable for steep inclines, the Class 185 was not able to carry out a test run until January 2009 however. Since 18 April 2009, passenger services are also electrified again. The current system is still single-phase AC 25 kV at 50 Hz. Electrification has ensured the operation and preservation of the line for the longer term. The reinstatement of passenger services is now, in principle, possible. In all the upgrade cost 9.6 million euros, of which the state paid 2.4 million.  Current developments  With a view to its longer term (tourist-based) preservation the state has mooted steam services at weekends, although this proposal has difficulties in terms of the likely costs. The last steam locomotive Mammut is still non-operational. It has also been suggested that the Class E 251 (today Class 171) could be used for heritage services. As a result two locomotives have been left at Blankenburg. Because the R√ºbeland Railway is an inclined route, only locomotives capable of inclined work can work it. On 17 December 2008 the ex-Prussian no. 95 1027 was transferred from Arnstadt shed to the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works, where it will be made operational for the R√ºbeland Railway at a cost of 350,000 euros.  Rolling stock  Originally cog locomotives were used on the line, but the introduction of the HBE Animal Class enabled it to be worked with a rack. Following nationalisation, Class 95.0s were also used. When the line was electrified Class 171s were introduced for passenger and goods trains. From 2000, passenger trains were no longer electric-hauled, because the locomotives had no means of operating the door closing equipment. Push-pull trains were introduced, hauled by Class 218s and running through to Halberstadt. The Class 171 remained in charge of goods trains until 2004. These were, however, replaced by Class 185s and Class 189s; neither lasting very long. On 1 April 2005, the HVLE delivered two-thirds of the transport services on the R√ºbeland Railway. They used diesel locomotives of the Blue Tiger class. As a result, DB Cargo also switched to diesel motive power, using Classes 241 and 233, because the maintenance of the catenary was uneconomical. The employment of these classes ended in 2006, when the HVLE took over the remaining Railion services. Today the following classes are used for goods trains: the Class 346, the Blue Tiger and the Class 285 of the HVLE. Since the recommencement of electric operations, 185 640 and 641 have worked the line, with the diesels in reserve.

Ogden befriended George Washington, who often visited his family residence while the Continental Army was quartered in Morristown. During that time, his young son, Thomas Ludlow Ogden, wounded Washington's hand in a fencing bout. This is believed to be the only injury that Washington suffered in the course of the war. Post-Revolutionary War After the war, Ogden settled in Newark. He represented Essex County in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1790. In 1791 President Washington appointed him U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,Cite as: The Papers of George Washington Digital Edition, ed. Theodore J. Crackel.

Washington also appointed Ogden as Commissioner to the Indians in Northern New York. He led the delegation that negotiated the Treaty of New York (1796) with the Seven Nations of Canada. They had been allies of the British during the Revolutionary War. Aware that the Iroquois and other tribes were being forced to cede most of their lands in New York State, which wanted to sell the property for development, Ogden, his brother Samuel, Gouverneur Morris and others purchased a large tract of land in New York, south of the Saint Lawrence River. They intended to plat and sell it to new settlers; many migrants were entering the state from New England, and some men made fortunes in land speculation. The town of Ogdensburg, New York was named after his brother, Samuel Ogden. Personal life On December 22, 1767, Ogden married Sarah Frances Ludlow (1744‚Äì1823), the daughter of Catherine (n√©e Le Roux) Ludlow and Thomas Ludlow, merchant of New York. Together, they had 13 children: * David A. Ogden (1770‚Äì1829), U.S. Representative from New York, married Rebecca C. Edwards * Catharine L.

The player runs trade routes, fends off pirates, collects artifact and offers transport to fellow countrymen in need, all for the sake of climbing up the game's ranking ladder, which in turn allows the player to buy bigger ships, more firepower and larger cargo holds to progress quicker in the ranks. Gameplay Starting out The game is set in 1650. The player starts out with the most basic ship, Fluyt, and 5000 (5k) gold. Nations The player chooses a nation at the beginning of the game. Consequences lie in relations between nations, which nations declare war/peace will determine which ports the player can access at given times, and which ships will open fire on them at sea. The options are: *Dutch *English *French *Portuguese *Spanish Ships *Fluyt (Crew of 100. Cargohold of 300t. 4 banks of 1 cannon. Price: 4k) *Corvette (Crew of 100. Cargohold of 150t. 4 banks of 2 cannons. Price: 8k) *Merchant (Crew of 200. Cargohold of 500t. Price: 14k) *Frigate (Crew of 200. Cargohold of 350t. 4 banks of 4 cannons. Price: 16k) *East Indiaman (Crew of 250. Cargohold of 700t. Price: 21k) *Fourth rate (Crew of 300. Cargohold of 600t. Price: 27k. 4 banks of 8 cannons) Titles *Peddler (Fluyt and Corvette) *Journeyman (Merchant and Frigate) *Tradesman (East Indianman and Fourth rate, Small estate - 2 treasures max) *Merchant (Medium estate - 4 treasures max) *Master Merchant (Large estate - 6 treasures max) *Viscount (end of the game) Guild ladder Climbing up the ladder ranks grants the player titles, access to bigger ships, and bigger estates. The player can gather points in the categories, then cash them in for a title. Once they're granted a title, the points in the categories reset, allowing them to do it all over. Ammo *Round (Long range ammunition) *Chain (Short range ammunition, tears up sails leaving attacking ships dead in the water) *Grape (Short range ammunition, leaves big holes in attacking ships) Note: The actual purpose of grapeshot is to reduce the enemy crew. It's like firing a huge shotgun filled with grape sized balls of steel. Cannons *Swivel-gun (0.3t) *Saker (1.0t) *Demi-culverlin (1.2t) *Culverlin (2.0t) *Demi-cannon (2.5t) *Cannon (3.0t) Banks Players can place money in banks for safe keeping. This is useful if they ever lose a battle at sea, as they can start over with their savings. However, your savings are reduced by the interest rate over time, as you are paying for security. Reception The game was reviewed in 1995 in Dragon #221 by John Brunkhart in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Brunkhart gave the game 2 out of 5 stars. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Although the subject material may be a little too dry for some gamers, High Seas Trader is definitely a must for strategy fans.\\" See also *Sid Meier's Pirates!

The sculpture is located at the corner of New York and Blackford Streets, the north-east corner of the Herron School of Art and Design. Faust, an alumnus of Herron, created the , vividly colored aluminum sculpture for Herron's eighteen-month-long Public Sculpture Invitational. Installed on May 2, 2005, The Herron Arch 1 as well as fourteen additional sculptures included in the invitational, was part of the public grand opening of the Herron School of Art and Design's new home on the IUPUI campus. Description Over thirty geometrically shaped pieces of painted aluminum make up The Herron Arch 1. This sculpture is vividly painted using an airbrush technique. From the proper front and proper back of the sculpture, the viewer sees a predominantly black and white structure. However, from the proper left and proper right of the sculpture, the viewer sees a wide variety of vivid colors. The sculpture is painted in a geometric pattern on all sides. There is a stylized signature and date near the base of the structure on the proper left side. The square-shaped foot of the sculpture sits on a concrete base, and features a black and white geometric pattern which matches the overall aesthetic of the artwork. A large flood light is mounted flush with the concrete base on all four sides of the sculpture. There is a weather- damaged bronze plaque attached to the east corner of the base which lists the artist, title, and date of the sculpture. Information The Herron Arch 1 was the first large scale sculpture created by James Wille Faust, one of the Herron School of Art and Design's most notable alumni. In an effort to raise funds to name a drawing studio after Faust, the Herron School of Art and Design held an exhibition of Faust's work. Included in this exhibition were maquettes of potential large scale sculpture, including The Herron Arch 1. The Dean of Herron School of Art and Design, Valerie Eickmeier, noticed this particular maquette during the exhibition. In an effort to fulfill Faust's wish of creating a large scale sculpture, she suggested commissioning the piece for the upcoming Public Sculpture Invitational. Through grants and fund raising, as well as the generous donation of time by the artist, the $115,000 sculpture was created and now serves as the signature piece of artwork of the Herron School of Art and Design. The Herron Arch 1 was one of fifteen sculptures placed on the grounds of the new Herron School of Art and Design during the first ever Public Sculpture Invitational. The invitational lasted eighteen months, and initially, this piece was the only permanent sculpture of the group. Since the removal of the invitational works, three others have become permanent fixtures on the Herron grounds: Anatomy Vessels by Eric Nordgulen, Torso Fragment by Casey Eskridge, and Job by Judith Shea. The Herron Arch 1 was commissioned by the Herron School of Art and Design to stand on the north-east corner of the school's property. This is the south west corner of the New York Street and Blackford Street intersection. Since its initial installation, the sculpture has not been moved, and is visible online via Google Street View.The Herron Arch 1 on Google Street View Artist James Wille Faust, an Indianapolis resident, was born in 1949 in Lapel, Indiana. He earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in sculpture from the Herron School of Art and Design in 1971 and a Master of Fine Arts in painting from the University of Illinois in 1974. Faust's vivid paintings have earned him praise throughout his career. His use of the airbrush is both unique and captivating. In 1992, Faust received national recognition when his work was included in the Absolut Art Collection sponsored by Absolut Vodka. For the award winning \\"Absolut Statehood\\" campaign, Faust created \\"Absolut Indiana\\" in an effort to capture the spirit of the state. Faust also served on the N.A.S.A.

It operated between junction 3 (A312) to the start of the elevated 2-lane section near Brentford. The lane, which had no intermediate junctions, was reserved for buses, coaches, motorbikes, emergency vehicles and licensed taxis but not mini-cabs. It was positioned in Lane 3 on the motorway, causing bus drivers to switch lanes between 1 mile and 500 yards before the lane started. The lane opened as a pilot in June 1999 and was made permanent in 2001. It was suspended during December 2010 using an 18-month Experimental Traffic Order after which it was reinstated temporarily for the 2012 London Olympics. It has since been scrapped permanently. History The M4 is mostly a 3-lane motorway, but between Junctions 2 and 3, it narrows down to 2 lanes and the hard shoulder disappears. As a result, the point where the 3 lanes narrowed to two lanes proved a significant bottleneck. The original intention was to replace the bottleneck with a lane drop at Junction 3, meaning that the road stretch between Junctions 2 and 3 would be narrowed to two lanes. The redundant tarmac was then converted into the busway.CBRD M4 Bus Lane The lane, replacing the original offside lane (the lane nearest to the central reservation) of the motorway, was opened as a pilot by the then Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott on 7 June 1999 and was made permanent in 2001. A speed limit of 50 mph was created when the bus lane opened, which was then raised to 60 mph in 2002 when motorcycles were also allowed to use the lane. Research into the effect of the lane was undertaken by the Transport Research Laboratory in 2000 and 2003. (see below) On 1 October 2010 it was reported that the transport secretary, Philip Hammond, was likely to announce at the Conservative Party conference that the lane would be suspended for 18 months from 24 December 2010 to be brought back for the 2012 Summer Olympics after which it would be scrapped. During his speech to the Conservative Party conference Philip Hammond explained that removing the bus lane would result in 'shortening average journey times; reducing congestion; restoring a sense of fairness. Seven Freedom of information requests were made the following day to various organisations (see below). A section of the bus lane was removed and the lane reverted to all-traffic use on 16 November 2010. By the end of December 2010 the entire lane had been removed and the full road width reverted to all-traffic use. However, the 60 mph speed limit is still imposed on the stretch from junction 3. Usage In addition to taxicabs and motorcycles, a number of UK coach services were using the lane. National Express Coaches services include: 030/032 (Portsmouth-London), 033 (Salisbury- London), 035 (Poole-London), 040 (Bristol-London), 402 (Frome-London), 403 (Bath-London), 404/504 (Penzance-London), 413 (Hereford-London), 421 (Blackpool-London), 501 (Totnes-London), 502 (Westward Ho!-London), 505 (Newquay-London), 508 (Haverfordwest-London), 509 (Swansea-London) and 509 (Aberdeen-London); Megabus operate M14 (Cheltenham-London), Green Line Coaches operate their 701 and 702 (Bracknell-London) service and Berry's Coaches the 351 (Tiverton-London) service. In May 2001 a Sunday Times survey found that of 111 buses that used the bus lane over a 5 hours 50 minute period, 38 were carrying no passengers, 37 were carrying 10 or fewer passengers, 15 were half full and 21 were full. Research A study by the Transport Research Laboratory 'Monitoring of the M4 bus lane: the first year' was produced in 2000 reported that the ¬£1.9m scheme had reduced rush hour journey times by 3.5 minutes for buses and one minute for cars. Off-peak car journey times were a minute longer due to a reduced speed limit which was cut from to and overall journey times had increased by 1.8%. CO2 emissions were cut by 16%, fuel consumption had improved by 16% and that noise levels were down by one decibel. Transport for London reported that the 7% of M4 traffic that used the bus lane carried 21% of the people. TRL produced a further report in 2003 'Monitoring of the M4 bus lane: 2000 to 2002'. A 2005 literature review of research into high-occupancy lanes produced for the Highways Agency reported that the lane was used about 3700 vehicles a day (3100 taxis, 500 buses or coaches and 100 minibuses) and that there was an overall benefit was 200 person-hours per weekday and a dis-benefit of 350 person-hours per weekend day; the dis-benefit being the result of the reduced speed-limit. Freedom of information requests A number of freedom of information requests have been made in relation to the M4 bus lane: *14 August 2009‚ÄîHighways Agency which revealed that a total of 20 Penalty Charge Notices had been issued since January 2008 for misuse of the bus lane. *29 October 2009‚ÄîPublic Carriage Office which revealed that 192 complaints had been made about private hire vehicles using the bus lane. *2 October 2010‚ÄîSeven FOI requests were received by agencies following the announcement that the lane was to be removed: Highways Agency (two requests), the first requested details of data held relating to the operation of the bus lane, in particular reports produced by the Transport Research Laboratory and around the decision to remove the lane. The Response was delayed with the reason given as \\"The complexity and volume of the requested information and the current position surrounding the issues of the M4 bus lane mean that it is impracticable for us to give a full response within the original 20 days\\". The second requested details of the changes, communications relating to the changes and analysis. Department for Transport requesting details of data held and correspondence relating to the bus lane. No response had been received by 13 November 2010. Transport for London who responded saying that they had not been part of any discussion. Borough Councils traversed by the bus lane Hillingdon Borough Council, Ealing Borough Council, and Hounslow Borough Council responded saying that they had not been part of any discussion. *13 October 2010‚ÄîPrime Minister's Office requesting details of correspondence regarding the removal of the M4 Bus Lane. The response was that no information was held by that office. Controversy The lane has been controversial since it was first introduced; In 2001 the Automobile Association suggested that it could only be deemed a success if 'significant numbers of drivers switched from their cars to public transport' and Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear said he would 'vote for anyone who promised to tear up that stupid pinko bus lane'. When John Prescott appeared as a guest on Top Gear on 27 February 2011, the bus lane was the first topic raised by Clarkson. Citing independent research, Prescott maintained that reducing the motorway to two general lanes, had improved traffic flow and raised the average speed and lowered journey times for all users, while also improving safety. Countering this theory, Clarkson asked why the government had agreed to widen other motorways, which Prescott justified on the rise in number of cars on the roads (7 million new cars). In 2009 the Automobile Association described it as an underused 'white elephant'. When announcing the suspension of the scheme in 2010 Philip Hammond said that 'Nothing is more symbolic of Labour‚Äôs war on the motorist', the RAC Foundation supported the move with director Stephen Glaister commenting that 'Most drivers on the M4 will wonder why this decision has taken so long'. A Freedom of Information request in 2009 revealed that the bus lane was barely enforced, with only 20 fixed penalty notices being issued in the preceding 18 months and that private drivers were able to get away with regularly driving in it.

As an inker on DC Comics series including Batman, Green Lantern, Justice League of America and The Atom, he helped to define the company's house style for its 1960s Silver Age superheroes. Biography Early career Sid Greene broke into comics during the 1930s to 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Initially, he freelanced at Funnies, Inc., one of the early \\"packages\\" that supplied comic books on demand for publishers testing the new medium.Sid Greene at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. Archived from the original on October 22, 2011. His first confirmed work, during a time when published credits were not routinely given in comics, is as penciler and inker of a nine-page \\"Spark Stevens\\" story in Fox Comics' The Green Mask #5 (June 1941), although Greene has been tentatively identified on stories in issues of Fiction House's Planet Comics and Fight Comics cover-dated as early as April 1940. His first signed work is as penciler-inker of a 10-page story starring the superhero the Patriot in The Human Torch #5[a] (Summer 1941), published by Timely Comics, the Golden Age forerunner of Marvel Comics.Sid Greene at the Grand Comics Database Through 1943, Greene drew the adventures of Target and the Targeteers in Novelty Press' Target Comics, and penciled a small number of Captain America and Miss America stories for Timely. During the decade, he also penciled comic-book stories for Ace Comics, Eastern Color, and Hillman Periodicals. For Holyoke Publishing, he drew the features \\"Fangs\\", \\"Inspector Hunt\\", and \\"Speed Spaulding\\". Joining DC Comics In the 1950s, after doing at least one story for Avon Comics, Greene did anthological horror, crime and romance comics for Atlas Comics, that decade's forerunner of Marvel Comics, and also drew romance stories for DC Comics, Orbit Publications, Quality Comics, and Ziff-Davis. His first known story for DC, where he would become best known during the imminent Silver Age of Comic Books, was the six- page \\"The Wrong Love\\", in Secret Hearts #18 (Nov. 1953). His first science fiction for DC was the eight-page \\"Earth Is the Target\\" in Mystery in Space #26 (July 1955), an anthology series in which Greene and writer Gardner Fox would co-create the team Star Rovers in issue #66 (March 1961). Well into the early 1960s, Greene contributed many dozens of anthological science-fiction stories to Mystery in Space and Strange Adventures. He also drew all six issues of DC's The New Adventures of Charlie Chan (June 1958 - April 1959), starring the long-running fictional Chinese-American detective of novels and films. Silver Age superheroes Greene's first DC superhero work was inking Gil Kane on a backup Atom story in The Atom #8 (Sept. 1963). Along with Murphy Anderson, he became one of Kane's two regular inkers on that series, which generally featured two Atom stories each issue. Greene also soon became Kane's regular inker on Green Lantern, beginning with issue #29 (June 1964). As historian Daniel Herman wrote, \\"Finally, Kane had somebody who could keep up with his frenetic pacing and full-bodied anatomy.\\" Greene soon became one of editor Julius Schwartz's most prolific inkers, one whose work helped define the DC look of the mid to late 1960s. He began inking the Elongated Man backup feature in Detective Comics, over penciler Carmine Infantino, and Batman stories over, initially, penciler Sheldon Moldoff (ghosting for Bob Kane),Batman #169 at the Grand Comics Database beginning in Batman #169-170, 172-174 (Feb.-March 1965, May‚ÄìJuly 1965). Greene soon became, as well, one of the regular Batman inkers in Detective Comics, including on issue #359 (Jan. 1967), the debut of Batgirl,Detective Comics #359 at the Grand Comics Database with penciler Infantino ‚Äî all while continuing to ink the adventures of the previous three characters mentioned. In addition to all this, Schwartz assigned Greene to succeed the retired Bernard Sachs as regular inker on the publisher's primary superhero-team series, Justice League of America, beginning with issue #46 (Aug. 1966). Greene \\"added a new crispness to Mike Sekowsky's pencils for three years until [Greene]'s retirement in 1969.\\"\\"Sid Greene\\" (biography), Crisis On Multiple Earths (DC Comics, 2002) As Herman assessed, \\"Although Greene had a strong personality as a penciler, as an inker, he was able to successfully submerge his style and to highlight the pencilers he was embellishing.\\"Herman, p. 96 As a gesture of appreciation toward editor Schwartz, Greene in many Mystery in Space and Strange Adventures stories would draw characters who resembled him. Late in his career, Greene also returned to Marvel Comics, for whose predecessor companies he had drawn in the 1940s and 1950s. Freelancing, he inked George Tuska on a 20-page story of the jungle lord Ka-Zar in Marvel Super-Heroes #19 (March 1969); and the 20-page story in the superspy series Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #12 (May 1969), co-inking Barry Windsor-Smith (then billed as Barry Smith) in one of the future industry star's earliest professional works. After his final issue of Justice League (#73, Aug. 1969), Greene inked one last superhero story, the lead feature in Atom and Hawkman #45 (Nov. 1969). He then both penciled and inked stories in two issues each of Our Army at War and the supernatural anthology The Unexpected, plus one story each in The Witching Hour and House of Secrets. His stories in The Unexpected #117 and House of Secrets #84 (both cover-dated March 1970, and drawn at least three months earlier) mark his final published works.

California on the Crimea In 1943 a world-famous actor of the Moscow Yiddish State Art Theater, Solomon Mikhoels, together with well-known poet Itzik Feffer, toured the United States on behalf of the Jewish Antifascist Committee. Before their departure, KGB Chief Lavrenti Beria instructed Mikhoels and Feffer to emphasize the great contribution of Jews to science and culture in the Soviet Union. Their assignment was to raise money and convince American public opinion that Soviet anti-Semitism had been crushed as a result of Joseph Stalin's policies. In 1944 and the first half of 1945, Stalin's strategic motivation was to use the Jewish issue as a bargaining chip to bring in international investment to rebuild the war-torn Soviet Union and to influence the postwar realignment of power in the Middle East. Stalin planned to use Jewish aspirations for a homeland to attract Western credits. Intentions to form a Jewish republic actually existed, based on a letter addressed to Stalin from the Jewish Antifascist Committee. Part of the letter, published for the first time in 1993, stated: > The creation of a Jewish Soviet republic will once and forever, in a > Bolshevik manner, within the spirit of Leninist-Stalinist national policy, > settle the problem of the state legal position of the Jewish people and > further development of their multicentury culture.

Kheifetz said the letter was a proposal with details for a plan to make the Crimean Socialist Republic a homeland for Jewish people from all over the world. The co-ordination and execution of Stalin's plans to lure foreign investors was entrusted to Kheifetz. The Soviet plan was for him to lay the groundwork for American investment in the metal and coal mining industries in the Soviet Union. It was rumoured that Mikhoels might be offered the post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet in the proposed new republic. Apart from Molotov, Lozovsky, and other high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mikhoels was the only one aware of Stalin's plans to establish another Soviet republic. Stalin hoped to receive $10 billion in credits from the U.S. for the restoration of the Soviet economy after the war. The plan to lure American capital was associated with the idea of a Jewish state in the Crimea was called California in the Crimea. Kheifetz widely discussed the plan in America.

In 2012, Kelly received the Victorian of the Year award and in 2003 and 2004, she was nominated for the Australian of the Year awards. Biography Born in Melbourne on 31 January 1964, Kelly first developed an interest in disadvantaged children when, as an 8-year-old, she saw a documentary film about Mother Teresa and decided she wanted to be an aid worker. As a primary school student in Carlton, she would climb the fence of her school to help feed the children at the special school next door. In 1982, after completing year 10 at St Aloysius' Girls' College in North Melbourne, she left school and completed a course to be a special education teaching assistant and in 1984 trained as a lay missionary and completed a probation officer course for working with young offenders. She then travelled to Western Australia and worked as a \\"house mother\\" at an Aboriginal mission. On returning to Melbourne, she sold her car to finance her airfare, and left for Calcutta where she stayed and worked with Mother Teresa's mission. Kelly, a practising Catholic, remained in India with Mother Teresa for six months until her visa expired. In 1987 she returned to India and continued her work with Mother Teresa and in 1988 she was honoured as an Australian Bicentenary Young Woman of the Year for her work in community services and the Advance Australia Ambassador Award. In 1992 Kelly received the Paul Harris Rotary International Award for her work in The Bronx, New York City and in 1994 she was awarded the first Sir Edward Dunlop award for humanitarian service. In 1994, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kelly started Nobody's Children, a volunteer program at a refugee camp. She became the program's Director of Field Operations and organised aid and welfare programs in several refugee camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including opening two pharmacies, starting a free mobile dental health care clinic, starting a home care program, organising the emergency medical evacuation of patients to hospitals overseas, and developing education and recreation programs. Kelly left the Nobody's Children program in 1997. Kelly returned to Australia in the late 1990s and in 1999 she set up the non- profit organisation Children First Foundation. Children in developing countries who have existing and often serious health problems, which local doctors are unable to treat effectively, are referred to the Foundation by aid workers, medical staff and church ministries and missions. The Foundation then facilitates provision of medical treatment, often bringing the children to Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital and the Epworth Hospital, where specialist medical and nursing staff donate their expertise. Specialists in New York, Boston and Ireland have also donated their services. In 2001, Kelly and the Children First Foundation opened a farm in Kilmore known as the Open Door Rotary Farm, where she accommodates and cares for the children brought to Australia for treatment. Donated and built by Rotary, the property includes a purpose-built house with 12 bedrooms where children having surgery and medical treatment can rehabilitate before returning home to their families. The Children First Foundation has brought children to Australia for medical treatment from countries including Albania, Djibouti, East Timor, Indonesia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Nigeria, Zambia and the Solomon Islands. Awards and recognition In 2001, Kelly's humanitarian work was recognised with several awards, including the Prime Minister's Award for outstanding community service, the White Flame Award from Save the Children for her service to disadvantaged children, and she was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of her service to both the Australian and international communities. In 2003, Kelly received the Victorian of the Year award, and in 2003 and 2004, she was nominated for the Australian of the Year awards. A Compassionate Rage is a 2001 documentary film by Film Australia and Alan Lindsay following Kelly for 18 months on her missions overseas as she tries to organise medical treatment for sick and injured children. In 2013 Kelly founded Global Gardens of Peace, a newly humanitarian organisation based in Melbourne, Australia to provide safe play and garden areas in post war and third world countries. Alongside a team of dedicated volunteers, the inaugural garden is to be established in Gaza City in Palestine. During a 2017 concert of Coldplay, the band performed the song Imagine with Emmanuel Kelly in recognition of Moira Kelly's work. Twins Herself a twin, Kelly is now the legal guardian of the originally cranially conjoined twins from Bangladesh, Trishna and Krishna, separated in 2009 in a 38-hour operation at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital by a 16-member team of specialist medical and nursing staff led by Wirginia Maixner, director of neurosurgery at the hospital. Their birth mother, a twenty-two-year-old student completing final exams at the Keshobpur Agricultural College in Jessore, gave the twins up for adoption in a Dhaka orphanage. On 8 February 2012, their story was featured on the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service science television series NOVA. Kelly is also the adoptive mother of Iraqi-born brothers Emmanuel and Ahmed Kelly. The brothers, born with \\"severely underdeveloped limbs\\" due to chemical warfare, were discovered by Kelly in 1998 at the Mother Teresa Orphanage in Baghdad. Kelly brought them both to Australia for medical treatment and subsequently adopted them. In 2009, Ahmed and Emmanuel Kelly became Australian citizens. Ahmed, a quadruple amputee and swimmer, represented Australia in the 50-metre breaststroke, 50-metre backstroke, 150-metre individual medley, and the 100-metre freestyle at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Emmanuel Kelly was a contestant on the 2011 season of The X Factor. He was cut from the competition on 11 September 2011, \\"after forgetting the lyrics several times during his performance.\\" Following his appearance on The X-Factor, he met with producers and auditioned for The Glee Project.

This includes all forms of publication, from initial research reports, to articles posted on websites, and the commonly recognized magazine articles and books. Publication process Idea The cycle begins with the authors deciding on what topic they wish to publish about. This can be a very quick step for some authors, who decided on a topic and develop it more later in the process, or the author can take a large amount of time fully developing a complete idea. Research This is when authors take their ideas and find out all the information that is readily available. For scientific publication, this includes previously done experiments as well has conducting more experiments that focus mainly on the chosen topic. For literary authors, this step includes reading previous publications and to see if any other authors have published work similar to theirs. Informal communication Informal communication is when authors get together and exchange ideas without there being any formal purposes or any structured agenda to guide them along. This includes dinners, going to the bar, phone calls, parties, and small gatherings. Idea protection Idea protection is when authors formalize their ideas and reserve their rights to them. This includes patents, copyright, trademark, registered trademarks, and creative commons. It is important for authors to protect their work so that others do not take credit for their work. Report findings This can be done in many different ways. There are formal reports, such as lab reports, research documents, and other white paper publications. Informal versions include posts on person web pages, blogs, and new forms like facebook posts. Conferences These meetings include both formal and inform forms of communication and are great ways not only to present your findings but also begin the cycle. Presentations and discussions are held to publicize research. Magazines and newspapers One of the more public and common types of publications, these are one of the most popular types of printed publications. These are used at many levels such as small towns, college campuses, and regional or national levels. Journal articles These vary a lot throughout their process, but they generally have the same objective in mind: to present an idea or position These can range from a personal to corporate journal and have many various subjects. Depending on the level, the journal article may be peer-reviewed by others in the field or a dedicated editing staff. * Examples * The Wall Street Journal * Personal Diary Book publication This is possibly one of the longest processes due to the many levels of review that go into the production of a book. There are usually many editions of books because each must be reviewed and revised before it actually goes into production. Also, many revisions to manuscripts may be made because of grammatical errors or a focus that needs to be fleshed out in more detail. Government documents There are many varieties of these documents. They can range from bills, deeds, constitutions or government contracts. These carry the most complexity with them because it must be kept updated regularly to reflect the current version of the document. Amendments to government documents make these documents have a longer publication cycle than most other documents because they must constantly be revised and it has to publicly be known that an amendment has been added and usually there are a series of checks these documents must pass through before their publication cycle has ended. Types of publication * Research reports are published when authors do experiments to help support their topics. Reports are generally a formal type of publications, but it depends on the author. Some authors simply publish research findings, without any detailed explanations or formal papers. Other authors will write up full reports, with all the findings, calculations, and conclusions drawn from the information found. * Conference papers are published following conferences. Authors find these helpful, not only for reviewing what happened during the conference, but also finding out what happened at conferences they were unable to attend. * Magazines and newspapers are some of the most commonplace publications that people think of. They are the main source of recent, up to date information that affects everyday life. These types of media are generally published from a day to a week after the event being reported on occurred. Daily newspapers operate on a 24-hour news cycle. * Journals are slower to publish information, but are more reputable than magazines and newspapers. Journals go through a much more formal and strict review process to ensure that the information is authenticated and trustworthy. * Books are the key publication type, used not only for information, but also telling stories, listing facts, and sharing opinions. Books go through a very long revision process which makes sure not only that all errors in the writing have been fixed, but also that there are no copyright infringements. * Encyclopedias are similar to books because they have a complicated revision process, but because of the information contained in encyclopedias and because they are periodicals, they are different in how they function. When encyclopedias are republished, all that changes is the information that has been proven wrong or has altered since the last publication. But even so, they are not normally published more than once a year.  Online publication types  * Blogs are simply people or a corporation's ideas that are published throughout the internet. These are not usually edited and usually have the most interaction with readers. They usually employ comment boxes that allow for people to comment on. The more followers the blog has, the more credible it appears. * Forums are usually for support or posting reviews and specific questions about a specific product or brand. * E-Books (see E-Book) An electronic book (or e-book) is a book publication made available in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices. * Personal website are usually hosted by an individual. It usually reflects the interest of that individual and can have any variety content they see fit to host and have the rights to host. * Corporate and government websites are usually contributed to expressly by employees of a particular company or department of the government. There is usually a small amount of funding that is solely devoted to the internet division of a particular camp. There is also a need to have servers and a large financial cost can be incurred due to the bandwidth that is needed because of the traffic that may travel to the page. * Tutorials are simply videos or texts that demonstrate how to perform a particular task. These can be a part of a larger site, such as Youtube.com, where users are able to post content that other may critique and view.
