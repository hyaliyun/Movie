The Democrats lost twenty-eight seats to the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. The Democrats also lost five seats in the U.S. Senate to the Republicans.

Thus, the Chief of the Dunguile sept is entitled to rightfully claim succession to the overlordship title of The MacCarthy M√≥r.

Aided by Wan Jen-Mi, innkeeper of the Spring Inn, a group of undercover resistance fighters seek to recover the map to save the rebellion.

The director King Hu used methods of framing to show action scenes in detail. Close to the end of the film, the director used cutting patterns and edge framing to show how similar all of the fighters' moves are. Hu also filmed The Fate of Lee Khan back to back with The Valiant Ones. Release The Fate of Lee Khan was distributed in Hong Kong on December 6, 1973. Reception From contemporary reviews, Tony Rayns reviewed The Fate of Lee Khan in Sight & Sound finding the film \\"always strikingly beautiful\\" and that it's \\"bald narrative outline risks suggesting that Lee Khan would sit more comfortably within the Chinese martial arts genre than in fact it does. Its vividly stylised clashes\\" were \\"far from being the film's raison d'etre as they are from being mere set-pieces.\\". Rayns concluded that the film was a \\"remarkable , and not just by the standards of Hong Kong cinema. One can only hope that its appearance here (mercifully subtitled, not dubbed) may herald more of King Hu's work.\\" Verina Glessner of the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that director King Hu \\"comes closest of all currently active Chinese directors to fitting our notion of an art film director\\" noting that he \\"isn't averse to check- mating audience expectations as much as his characters' moves.\\" Glessner also noted the script by King Hu and Wang Chung that \\"like the direction and the gallery of performances, shows a rare sharpness and sophistication.\\" From retrospective reviews, Michael Brooke wrote in Sight & Sound once the film is set up it was as \\"taut as any Hitchcock or Clouzot suspense.

It was established in Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal in 1885 by a trust formed by the nationalist leader, scholar and educationist Surendranath Banerjee, a year after he founded Surendranath College. This is now regarded one of the oldest Law college of British India. History The first name of the college was Presidency School in 1882, when it was handed over to Sri Banerjee on 1 January 1884. That same year the Post-Graduate Department of Law was extended, and it was affiliated to the Calcutta University as an independent professional college in 1885. Banerjee renamed the school the Presidency Institution and brought it to the status of a college affiliated to the F.A. standard. The name was later changed to Ripon College, named after the British Viceroy George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon. The name was changed again in 1949 to honour its founder Sri Surendranath Banerjee. The women's section of the college was founded in 1931 by Mira Datta Gupta, its first principal. Swami Vivekananda delivered his first address in Calcutta from the rostrum of this college on his return from Chicago after his famous deliverance at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893. In 1911, Rabindranath Tagore read out at this college one of his essays dealing with the twin subjects of separatism to be found among many of countrymen and national integration.

In 1970, he founded - along with Valery Chalidze and Andrei Sakharov - the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR. In 1973, Tverdokhlebov - along with Valentin Turchin - founded the first chapter of Amnesty International in the Soviet Union. He also helped found Group 73, a human rights organization that helped political prisoners in the Soviet Union. He was the author/editor of several samizdat publications while in the Soviet Union, which were compiled in the book, \\"In Defense of Human Rights\\", published by Khronika Press, New York, in 1975.  Biography  Andrei Tverdokhlebov was born in 1940 in Moscow into a high-ranking Communist government family. His father, Nikolai Tverdokhlebov, was the Soviet Deputy Minister of Culture in the 1950s and, later, the cultural attache to the Soviet embassy in the Federal Republic of Germany.Chalidze 1975, p. 10. Tverdokhlebov graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and did post-graduate work at the Dubna Institute of Nuclear Research, focusing on theoretical physics. In 1980, he emigrated to the United States. He appeared at a hearing before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee to discuss the role of Soviet scientists in the Soviet human rights movement, but, for the most part, ceased his human rights activities while in the U.S. However, he actively continued his scientific research - first at Lehigh University, then at Drexel University where he received a Ph.D. in 1989 with the thesis, \\"A New Approach to Bulk Wave Propagation in Anisotropic Media.\\"  Human Rights Activism  In November 1970, Tverdokhlebov, along with Andrei Sakharov and Valery Chalidze announced the formation of the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR. According to Sakharov's memoirs, the international publicity of the formation of this group surpassed any of their expectations. \\"For the next week, a good half of all broadcasts over the Voice of America, the BBC, and Deutsche Welle were about the Committee, stressing its significance as an independent association that would study human rights objectively and then publish its findings.\\" In February 1971, Tverdokhlebov and his associate, Chalidze, were summoned to the Moscow Procurator's Office and told that \\"the existence of their committee was an infringement of the law, and that by carrying on their activities, they were laying themselves open to criminal prosecution.\\"Sapiets 1971 In 1973, Tverdokhlebov and Valentin Turchin founded the first chapter of Amnesty International in the Soviet Union. Tverdokhlebov served as the chapter's Secretary. In 1974, Tverdokhlebov was accosted on the streets of Moscow by KGB agents, while walking home with a friend from a movie, and escorted back to his apartment where the agents proceeded to search through his belongings. During the search, several items were confiscated: three issues of the Chronicle of the Lithuanian Catholic Church; a copy of The Gulag Archipelago; three issues of A Chronicle of Human Rights [New York]; an issue of the Bulletin of the Council of Relatives of Evangelical-Christian Baptist Prisoners; documents in defense of civil rights; lists of addresses of political prisoners and their families; lists of addresses of German families wishing to emigrate to the Federal Republic of Germany (about 2,000 families); materials about the situation in labor camps and prisons; notebooks; a typewriter; and a tape recorder.Chronicle 1978 On 28 November 1974, Tverdokhlebov issued a \\"Statement on the Search of 27/28 November'\\", which ended with the sentence: \\"However, they have not yet taken away my fountain pen.\\" This would be one of several searches of his apartment.See A Chronicle of Current Events (Issue nos 34-36), p. 87 (147): 35.12, 31 March 1975, \\"Samizdat update\\". On 18 April 1975, Tverdokhlebov was arrested and taken to Lefortovo Prison to await his trial.See A Chronicle of Current Events (Issue nos 34-36), p. 91 (164-165): 36.1, 31 May 1975, \\"The Arrest of Andrei Tverdokhlebov\\". In 1975, ten Jewish scholars spoke out strongly in defense of Tverdokhlebov. \\"In a sharply worded appeal which has just reached the West they call on 'all people of good will' to demand Dr. Tverdokhlebov‚Äôs 'immediate release.' The appeal is notable, as Soviet Jews do not normally intercede for non-Jews, and Tverdokhlebov is a Russian. The only exceptions in the past have been the world-famous figures of Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.\\" In April 1976, the Moscow Municipal Court sentenced Tverdokhlebov to five years in exile for \\"dissemination of fabrications, known to be false, which discredit the Soviet State and social system\\". He was exiled to a small village of Nyurbachan in Yakutia, in Siberia. According to a New Scientist article from 1976, the village only had a few hundred inhabitants and was cut off from normal transport for eight months of the year due to extreme weather conditions. In October 1976, Andrei Sakharov and his wife traveled from Moscow to visit Tverdokhlebov in exile - a precarious journey, which Sakharov outlined in his memoirs. He is survived by his wife, Natalia Tverdokhlebova, and his step-daughter, Maria Fyodorova, both of Washington, D.C.

After the country formally declared independence in June 1991 and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia, it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. During that time the Croatian War of Independence started. On 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. The Badinter Arbitration Committee had to rule on the matter. Finally, Croatian independence was internationally recognized in January 1992, when both the European Economic Community and the United Nations granted Croatia diplomatic recognition, and the country was accepted into the United Nations shortly thereafter. Background Croatian Parliament building During the World War II period from 1941 to 1945, Croatia was established as a puppet state called the Independent State of Croatia, governed by the ultranationalist, fascist Usta≈°e, backed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy within the territory of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. From 1945 it became a Socialist federal unit of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a one- party state run by the League of Communists of Croatia created at the end of World War II in Yugoslavia. Croatia enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the Yugoslav federation. At the turn of the 1970s, a Croatian national protest movement called the Croatian Spring was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents. In the 1980s, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro.Frucht 2005, p. 433 As Slovenia and Croatia began to seek greater autonomy within the federation, including confederate status and even full independence, the nationalist ideas started to grow within the ranks of the still-ruling League of Communists. As Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá rose to power in Serbia, his speeches favored continuation of a unified Yugoslav state‚Äîone in which all power would be centralized in Belgrade.Brown & Karim (1995), p. 116 In March 1989, the crisis in Yugoslavia deepened after the adoption of amendments to the Serbian constitution that allowed the Serbian republic's government to re-assert effective power over the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Up until that time, a number of political decisions were legislated from within these provinces, and they had a vote on the Yugoslav federal presidency level (six members from the republics and two members from the autonomous provinces). In the Gazimestan speech, delivered on June 28, 1989, Milo≈°eviƒá remarked on the current \\"battles and quarrels\\", saying that even though there were currently no armed battles, the possibility could not be excluded yet. The general political situation grew more tense when in 1989 Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj publicly consorted with Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá, a World War II Chetnik leader. Years later, Croatian Serb leader Milan Babiƒá testified that Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá had financially supported the Serbs in Croatia in the 1990s. Conversely, Franjo Tuƒëman made international visits during the late 1980s to garner support from the Croatian diaspora for the Croatian national cause. Transition to democracy and political crisis In mid-1989, political parties other than the Communist Party were first allowed, starting a transition from the one-party system. A number of new parties were founded in Croatia, including the Croatian Democratic Union () (HDZ), led by Franjo Tuƒëman. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, on 20 January 1990, the delegations of the republics could not agree on the main issues in the Yugoslav federation. The Croatian and Slovenian delegations demanded a looser federation, while the Serbian delegation, headed by Milo≈°eviƒá, opposed this. As a result, the Slovenian and Croatian delegates left the Congress. Having completed the anti-bureaucratic revolution in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro, Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes in 1991, and it was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, because unfavorable decisions could be blocked; this rendered the governing body ineffective. This situation led to objections from other republics and calls for reform of the Yugoslav Federation.Frucht (2005), p. 433 In February 1990, Jovan Ra≈°koviƒá founded the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) in Knin. Its program stated that the \\"regional division of Croatia is outdated\\" and that it \\"does not correspond with the interest of Serb people\\".Goldstein (1999), p. 214 The party program endorsed redrawing regional and municipal lines to reflect the ethnic composition of the areas, and asserted the right of territories with a \\"special ethnic composition\\" to become autonomous. This echoed Milo≈°eviƒá position that internal Yugoslav borders should be redrawn to permit all Serbs to live in a single country. Prominent members of the SDS were Milan Babiƒá and Milan Martiƒá, both of whom later became high-ranking RSK officials. During his later trial, Babiƒá would testify that there was a media campaign directed from Belgrade that portrayed the Serbs in Croatia as being threatened with genocide by the Croat majority and that he fell prey to this propaganda.Babiƒá verdict, p. 9 On 4 March 1990, a meeting of 50,000 Serbs was held at Petrova Gora. People at the rally shouted negative remarks aimed at Tuƒëman, chanted \\"This is Serbia\\", and expressed support for Milo≈°eviƒá.Ramet 2006, p. 382 Political moves and civil unrest In late April and early May 1990, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuƒëman's win resulting in further nationalist tensions. A tense atmosphere prevailed in 1990: on May 13, 1990, a football game was held in Zagreb between Zagreb's Dinamo team and Belgrade's Crvena Zvezda team. The game erupted into violence between football fans and police. On May 30, 1990, the new Croatian Parliament held its first session. President Tuƒëman announced his manifesto for a new Constitution and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, including a plan for Yugoslavia as a confederation of sovereign states. On July 25, 1990, Croatia made constitutional amendments that asserted and effected its sovereignty ‚Äì the \\"Socialist\\" prefix was dropped from the country's name, the President of Croatia replaced the President of the Presidency, in addition to other changes. The changes in the July 1990 Croatian Constitution did not relate to the status of the Serbs, which remained identical to the one granted by the 1974 Croatian Constitution (based on the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution). Nationalist Serbs in Croatia boycotted the Sabor and seized control of Serb- inhabited territory, setting up road blocks and voting for those areas to become autonomous. The Serb \\"autonomous oblasts\\" would soon become increasingly intent on achieving independence from Croatia. After HDZ came to power, they conducted a purge of Serbs employed in public administration, especially the police. The Serbs of Croatia held a disproportionate number of official posts: in 1984, 22.6% of the members of the League of Communists of Croatia and 17.7% of appointed officials in Croatia were Serbs, including 28-31% in the Ministry of the Interior (the police). Whereas, in 1981, they represented 11.5% and in 1991, 12.2% of the total population of Croatia.Milo≈°eviƒá indictment, p. 29 An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier on, which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime.Bjelajac, ≈Ωunec, Boduszynski, Draschtak, Graovac, Kent, Malli, Pavloviƒá, Vuiƒá (2009), p. 239 President Tuƒëman made several clumsy remarks ‚Äî such as the one from an April 16, 1990 speech that he was 'glad that his wife is not a Serb' that was taken out of context. All this was deliberately distorted by Milo≈°eviƒá's media in order to artificially spark fear that any form of an independent Croatia is a new \\"ustashe state\\": in one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuƒëman shaking hands with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, accusing them of plotting to impose \\"a Fourth Reich\\". The new Tuƒëman government was nationalistic and insensitive towards Serbs, but did not pose a threat to them before the war.Brown & Karim (1995), p. 119 The political crisis escalated when the Serb-populated areas attempted to form an enclave called Serbian Krajina which intended to separate from Croatia if Croatia itself attempted to separate from Yugoslavia. The Serb leadership in Krajina refused to recognize the government of the Republic of Croatia as having sovereignty over them. The crisis began in August 1990 with the Log Revolution as Croatian Serbs cut down trees and used them to block roads. This hampered Croatian tourism and caused alarm in the province of Dalmatia as Croatia was hosting the 1990 European Athletics Championships in Split. On December 21, 1990, a new \\"Christmas Constitution\\" was passed, that adopted a liberal democracy. The constitution defined Croatia as \\"the national state of the Croatian nation and a state of members of other nations and minorities who are its citizens: Serbs... who are guaranteed equality with citizens of Croatian nationality....\\" The status of Serbs was changed from an explicitly mentioned nation (narod) to a nation listed together with minorities (narodi i manjine). This constitutional change was also read by the majority of Serb politicians as taking away some of the rights that the Serbs had been granted by the previous Socialist constitution, and it fuelled extremism among the Serbs of Croatia. This was not based on the literal reading of the former Constitution of SR Croatia, which had also treated solely Croats as a constitutive nation, saying Croatia was \\"national state\\" for Croats, \\"state\\" for Serbs and other minorities. On February 21, 1991, Croatia declared its Constitution and laws supreme to that of the SFRY, and the Parliament enacted a formal resolution on the process of disassociation () from SFR Yugoslavia and possible new association with other sovereign republics. Over two hundred armed incidents involving the rebel Serbs and Croatian police were reported between August 1990 and April 1991.David C. Isby, \\"Yugoslavia 1991: Armed Forces in Conflict\\", Jane's Intelligence Review 394, 402 (September 1991) Independence referendum and decisions On May 19, 1991, the Croatian authorities held the Croatian referendum on independence. Serb local authorities called for a boycott of the vote, which was largely followed by Croatian Serbs. In the end, a majority of Croatians endorsed independence from Yugoslavia, with a turnout of 83.56% and the two referendum questions answered positively by 93.24% and 92.18% (resp.) of the total number of votes. On June 25, 1991, the country declared its independence from the SFRY, finalizing its effort to end its status as a constituent republic. That decision of the parliament decision was partially boycotted by left-wing party deputies. The European Economic Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe immediately urged both Croatia and Slovenia that they would not be recognized as independent states because of a fear of a civil war in Yugoslavia. By mid-1991, the Croatian War of Independence had already started. Serb-controlled areas of Croatia were part of the three \\"Serb Autonomous Oblasts\\" later known as the Republic of Serbian Krajina, bulk of which would not be under Croatian control until 1995, and the remaining parts in 1998. Croatia was first recognized as an independent state on 26 June 1991 by Slovenia, which declared its own independence on the same day as Croatia. But by 29 June, the Croatian and Slovenian authorities agreed to a three-month moratorium on the independence declaration, in an effort to ease tensions. The Brijuni Agreement was formally signed in a meeting of the European Community Ministerial Troika, the Yugoslav, Serbian, Slovenian and Croatian authorities on 7 July. Lithuania was the sole state that recognized Croatia on 30 July. The Badinter Arbitration Committee was set up by the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community (EEC) on 27 August 1991 to provide legal advice and criteria for recognition to former Yugoslav republics. The five- member commission consisted of presidents of constitutional courts in the EEC. INA building in ≈†ubiƒáeva Street, Zagreb was selected for security reasons as the venue for parliament's declaration of independence on 8 October 1991 On 7 October, the eve of expiration of the moratorium, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked Banski dvori, the main government building in Zagreb. On 8 October 1991, the moratorium expired, and the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. That particular session of the parliament was held in the INA building on Pavao ≈†ubiƒá Avenue in Zagreb due to security concerns provoked by recent Yugoslav air raid; Specifically, it was feared that the Yugoslav Air Force might attack the parliament building. This decision was reached unanimously in the Parliament, and the only parliamentary deputies missing were some from the Serb parties that had been absent since early 1991. General recognition Germany advocated quick recognition of Croatia, in order to stop ongoing violence in Serb-inhabited areas, with Helmut Kohl requesting recognition in the Bundestag on 4 September. Kohl's position was opposed by France, the United KingdomLukaƒç, Morana (2013). Germany's Recognition of Croatia and Slovenia: Portrayal of the events in the British and the US press. Saarbr√ºcken: AV Akademikerverlag. , and the Netherlands, but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach by following Germany's unilateral action. On 10 October, two days after the Croatian Parliament confirmed the declaration of independence, the EEC decided to postpone any decision to recognize Croatia for two months. German foreign minister Hans Dietrich Genscher later wrote that the EEC decided to recognize Croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then. With the war still ongoing when the deadline expired, Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its policy and duty. Germany's position was supported by Italy and Denmark. France and the UK attempted to prevent German recognition by drafting a United Nations resolution requesting that no country take unilateral actions which could worsen the situation in Yugoslavia. Robert Badinter presided over the Arbitration Commission of the Conference on Yugoslavia Starting in late November 1991, the Badinter Commission rendered a series of ten opinions. The Commission stated, among other things, that Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution, and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics could not be altered unless freely agreed upon. Factors in the preservation of Croatia's pre-war borders were the Yugoslav federal constitutional amendments of 1971 and 1974, granting that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947. Ultimately, France and the UK backed down during the Security Council debate on the matter on 14 December, when Germany appeared determined to defy the UN resolution. On 17 December, the EEC formally agreed to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992, on the basis of its request and a positive opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Commission. In its Opinion No. 5 on the specific matter of Croatian independence, the Commission ruled that Croatia's independence should not yet be recognized, because the new Croatian Constitution did not incorporate protections for minorities required by European Community. In response to this decision, the President of Croatia Franjo Tuƒëman wrote to Robert Badinter, giving assurances that this deficit would be remedied. Ukraine and Latvia were the first to react by recognizing Croatian independence in the second week of December. The following week, Iceland and Germany recognized it, on 19 December 1991, as the first western European countries to do so. In response to the decisions of the Badinter Commission, the RSK formally declared its separation from Croatia on 19 December, but its statehood and independence were not recognized internationally. On 26 December, Yugoslavia announced plans for a smaller state, which could include the territory captured from Croatia during the war. This plan was rejected by the UN General Assembly. Three more countries decided to recognize Croatia before the EEC-scheduled date of January 15: Estonia, the Holy See, and San Marino. The European Economic Community finally granted Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992, and the United Nations did so in May 1992. Aftermath In the period following the declaration of independence, the war escalated, with the sieges of Vukovar and Dubrovnik, and fighting elsewhere, until a ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to stabilization and a significant reduction of violence. With the end of 1991, the second Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist as a state, with the prime minister Ante Markoviƒá and president of the presidency Stjepan Mesiƒá resigning in December 1991, and caretaker government representing it until the country's formal dissolution in April 1992. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory for Croatia as a result of Operation Storm. Present day borders of Croatia were established when the remaining Serb-held areas of eastern Slavonia were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998. Legacy Since 2002, 8 October is celebrated as Croatia's Independence Day, while 25 June is recognized as Statehood Day. Previously, May 30th, marking the day when the first democratic parliament was constituted in 1990, had been commemorated as Statehood Day. Although it is not a public holiday, 15 January is marked as the day Croatia won international recognition by Croatian media and politicians. On the day's 10th anniversary in 2002, the Croatian National Bank minted a 25 kuna commemorative coin.

Through his two marriages, Sir Alexander amassed considerable wealth and power in the Lowland Scottish counties of Berwickshire, West Lothian, East Lothian and Peeblesshire. For the five centuries following Sir Alexander, the Cockburn family was, through its significant landholdings and political connections, an influential force in Scottish affairs. Sir Alexander's parentage is unclear from the surviving record; however, his marriages to two prominent heiresses suggest that he was from a well-known branch of the Cockburn family. In the summer of 1296, along with the bulk of the Scottish nobility and senior clergy, Pieres de Cokeburn and Thomas de Cokeburn 'del counte de Rokesburgh' signed the Ragman Roll pledging their allegiance to King Edward I of England. It seems likely that Sir Alexander was related to Pieres and Thomas, and might very well have been the son of one of them. In 1330, Sir Alexander de Cokburne became the Baron of Langton (in Berwickshire), Carriden (in West Lothian) and Bolton (in East Lothian) following his marriage to the wealthy Anglo-Norman heiress Mariota de Veteriponte (also known as Maria de Vipont).Thomas Cockburn-Hood, The house of Cockburn of that ilk and the cadets thereof: with historical anecdotes of the times in which many of the name played a conspicuous part, Scott and Ferguson, Edinburgh, 1888 Mariota's father, Sir William de Veteriponte, had fallen at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The barony of Langton was located to the southwest of Duns, and about 6 km away from Cockburn Tower on the southern slope of Cockburn Law. Sir Alexander's second marriage to the heiress Maria de Monfode added the barony of Skirling (in Peeblesshire).

He was a successful competitor at eisteddfodau for which he adopted the pseudonym Eos Morlais, and in 1867 he won the main prize as a vocalist at the National Eisteddfod of Wales. He was recognised as one of the leading Welsh soloists of his time. Bibliography Rees was born on 5 April 1841 in Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil, the son of Hugh and Margaret Rees. His father died when he was eight years old and his mother died soon afterwards. At the age of nine he began working in a coal-mine, but due to showing a talent for singing and recitation, he was given lessons in music by an uncle. As an adult Rees joined the Libanus Temperance choir and later became the choir's conductor. He took the pseudonym Eos Morlais, in reference to the River Moralis, which ran near his home during his childhood. He won several prizes at local eisteddfodau as a vocalist and in 1867, at the age of 26 years, he won the tenor competition at the National Eisteddfod at Carmarthen. In 1870, Rees moved to Swansea and became precentor at Soar Congregational chapel. He took a course of instruction at the Swansea Training College and was successful enough to give up work to devoted his whole time to music. Rees served for three years as precentor of Walter Road Congregational Church in Swansea and he conducted in singing festivals and served as adjudicator. In 1874, at the National Eisteddfod, held in Bangor, Rees performed the song Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau and according to the Baner ac Amserau Cymru journal \\"had taken the Eisteddfod by storm\\".

In 1887 Rees was invited to sing at the National Eisteddfod in London in front of the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward. Rees led the singing of God Bless the Prince of Wales and at the end of the meeting he also sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, to which the prince and his family rose, the first time royalty had stood to the Anthem of Wales.

It also adjusts the cutoff of the steam locomotive. Reversing lever This is the most common form of reverser. It consists of a long lever mounted, parallel to the direction of travel, on the driver‚Äôs side of the cab. It has a handle and sprung trigger at the top and is pivoted at the bottom so as to pass between two notched sector plates. The reversing rod, which connects to the valve gear, is attached to this lever, either above or below the pivot, in such a position as to give good leverage. A square pin is arranged so as to engage with the notches in the plates and hold the lever in the desired position when the trigger is released. The advantages of this design are that change between forward and reverse gear can be made very quickly as is needed in, for example, a shunting engine. Disadvantages are that, because the lever must rest at one of the notches, fine adjustment of the cutoff to offer best running and economy is not possible. On large locomotives it can be difficult to prevent the mechanism from jumping into full forward gear (‚Äúnose-diving‚Äù) when adjusting the cutoff once the locomotive has gathered speed: with such engines it was the practice of drivers to select an appropriate degree of cutoff before opening the regulator and to leave it in that position for the duration of the journey. Screw reverser Diagram of Stephenson valve gear controlled by a screw reverserIn this mechanism the reversing rod is controlled by a screw and nut, worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the reversing rod directly or through a lever, as above. The screw and nut may be cut with a double thread and a coarse pitch to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with a locking lever to prevent creep and there is an indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit. On locomotives fitted with Westinghouse air brake equipment and Stephenson valve gear, it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston. Compressed air from the brake reservoirs was applied to one side of the piston to reduce the effort required to lift the heavy expansion link, with gravity assisting in the opposite direction. The two pistons of the steam reverser can be seen at the extreme left on this Bulleid Merchant Navy class Power reverse gear With larger engines, the linkages involved in controlling cutoff and direction grew progressively heavier and there was a need for power assistance in adjusting them. Steam (or later, compressed air) powered reversing gear was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Typically, the operator worked a valve that admitted steam to one side or the other of a cylinder connected to the reversing mechanism until the indicator showed the intended position. A second mechanism, usually a piston in an oil-filled cylinder held in position by closing a control cock, was required to keep the linkages in place. The first locomotive engineer to fit such a device was James Stirling of the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1873. Several engineers then tried them, including William Dean of the GWR and Vincent Raven of the North Eastern Railway, but they found them little to their liking, mainly because of maintenance difficulties: any oil leakage from the locking cylinder, either through the piston gland or the cock, allowed the mechanism to creep, or worse ‚Äúnose- dive‚Äù, into full forward gear while running. Stirling moved to the South Eastern Railway and Harry Smith Wainwright, his successor with that company, incorporated them into most of his designs, which were in production about thirty years after Stirling‚Äôs innovation. Later still the forward-looking Southern Railway engineer Oliver Bulleid fitted them to his famous Merchant Navy Class of locomotives, but they were mostly removed at rebuild. Henszey's reversing gear, patented in 1882, illustrates a typical early solution.William P. Henszey, Reversing-Gear for Locomotives, U.S. Patent 259,538, June 13, 1882. Henszey's device consists of two pistons mounted on a single piston rod. Both pistons are double-ended. One is a steam piston to move the rod as required. The other, containing oil, holds the rod in a fixed position when the steam is turned off. Control is by a small three-way steam valve (‚Äúforward‚Äù, ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äúback‚Äù) and a separate indicator showing the position of the rod and thus the percentage of cutoff in use. When the steam valve is at ‚Äústop‚Äù, an oil cock connecting the two ends of the locking piston is also closed, thus holding the mechanism in position. The piston rod connects by levers to the reversing gear, which operates in the usual way, according to the type of valve gear in use. Steam reverser on a Southern Railway 2-8-0. The Ragonnet power reverse, patented in 1909, was a true feedback controlled servomechanism. The power reverse amplified small motions of reversing lever in the locomotive cab made with modest force into much larger and more forceful motions of the reach rod that controlled the engine cutoff and direction.Eugine L. Ragonnet, Controlling Mechanism for Locomotives, U.S. Patent 930,225, Aug. 9, 1909. It was usually air powered, but could also be steam powered.Jacob H Yoder, Locomotive Valves and Valve Gears, , Van Nostrand, New York, 1917; page 131. The term servomotor was explicitly used by the developers of some later power reverse mechanisms.Lincoln A. Lang, Servo Motor Mechanism, U.S. Patent 1,480,940, Jan 15, 1924. The use of feedback control in these later power reverse mechanisms eliminated the need for a second cylinder for a hydraulic locking mechanism, and it restored the simplicity of a single operating lever that both controlled the reversing linkage and indicated its position. The development of articulated locomotives was a major impetus to the development of power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of reverse gear, instead of just one on a simple locomotive.George R. Henderson, Recent Locomotive Development, Paper 90,Transactions of the International Engineering Congress -- Railway Engineering, San Francisco, Sept. 20-25, 1915; page 491.Charles McShane, Locomotive Power Reverse Gears, The Locomotive Up to Date, Griffin & Winters, 1921; 413. The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet reversing gear, and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield reversing gear, patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet reversing gear with added locking cylinder.James Hadfield, Hydraulic Locking Cylinder for Locomotive Reversing Gear, U.S. Patent 2,523,696, Sept. 26, 1950 (Oct. 7, 1944 in Great Britain). Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system. Many American locomotives were built, or retro-fitted, with power reverse, e.g. PRR K4s, PRR N1s, PRR B6, PRR L1s. Enginemen's terminology In the UK, a screw reverser is sometimes called a bacon slicer, particularly the type fitted to BR Standard locomotives. In the US, a reversing lever is called a Johnson bar.

Representing the three main branches of Celtic culture, the members were Johnny Cunningham (late of Silly Wizard) of Scotland, Kevin Burke (best known for the Bothy Band) of Ireland, and Christian LeMaitre (member of Kornog) of Brittany. Since Cunningham's death in 2003, the group has continued to perform, replacing him with Andre Brunet (formerly of La Bottine Souriante) from Quebec. Cunningham and Burke were both resident in the US and decided they wanted to tour together. It was suggested that a show with just 2 fiddlers, one Scottish, one Irish might not be appealing to many but if another element could be added it might be of interest. Because of their love for Breton music Kevin and Johnny decided to contact their good friend, Christian Lemaitre, from Brittany. Christian agreed and the Celtic Fiddle Festival was born. It was conceived as a \\"one-off\\" tour, an interesting way to showcase the 3 differing styles while at the same time demonstrating the deep historic connections, but the response from audiences was so positive that an album was released from that initial tour and, 20 yrs later, the group is still playing and recording. Cunningham, Burke, and LeMaitre were accompanied by guitarist John McGann on that first tour and the first album, The Celtic Fiddle Festival, was released on Green Linnet Records. The sixth album by the Celtic Fiddle Festival, Live in Brittany, was recorded in Jan 2013 and is scheduled for release in April on the Loftus Music label. During the group's 20 yr career its accompanists have included Breton guitarist Soig Siberil, Scottish guitar player Tony McManus, Ged Foley from the Battlefield Band and Patrick Street, Nicolas Quemener from Brittany.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) placed an initial order for 1,000 missiles and deliveries due to start in 2013. However, initial operating capability has been considerably delayed and is now expected in 2021 with full operating capability anticipated in 2024. https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/the-martlet-missile-wildcat-helicopter-gets- its-claws/The missile was given the name \\"Martlet\\" in British service. History The Lightweight Multirole Missile was initially conceived as Thales' response to the MoD's Future Air-to-Surface Guided Weapon (Light) FASGW(L) requirement. It was designed to be launched from a variety of naval, air and land platforms against a wide range of targets. High precision reduces collateral damage and makes the missile suitable for asymmetric littoral operations. Development began in 2008 and the LMM uses technology from an earlier Thales missile, the Starstreak. Qualification testing and initial production commenced in late 2011, following an initial contract by the UK Ministry of Defence in April 2011. Thales has conducted successful guidance control firings, including a semi-active laser (SAL) version. The MoD contract includes the design, development and qualification of a laser beam rider version of LMM, together with production of an initial quantity of 1,000 missiles. These will be operated from the new AgustaWestland AW159 helicopters and the current armoured and light role Starstreak ground based air defence batteries of 12 Regiment Royal Artillery and 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery. Thales graphics have shown helicopters carrying twin seven-round launchers. These were due to enter service in 2015 but where considerably delayed. The contract was funded by a deal to \\"re-role previously contracted budgets to facilitate the full-scale development, series production and introduction of the LMM.\\" In other words, other contract(s) were cut and the funds switched to paying for LMM. The most likely contract affected is for Starstreak, which is approaching the end of its term. Thales test-fired an LMM from a Schiebel Camcopter S-100, demonstrating a potential for use from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Description LMM is intended to provide a single family of weapons that can be used in different modes, including: *Maritime ‚Äì LMM will be carried on the new Lynx Wildcat helicopters of the Royal Navy for use against small surface vessels. ASELSAN of Turkey has developed dedicated mounting systems which can also enable the LMM to be launched from naval platforms such as fast attack craft. *Surface-to-surface ‚Äì The dual-effect (blast fragmentation and shaped charge) of the LMM's warhead makes it suitable for use against a wide range of ground targets including light/medium armour. *Air-launched ‚Äì The missile's modular design allows for future development and introduction of alternative warheads and seekers. *Surface-to-air ‚Äì In July 2019, the Air Defence Troop of 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group tested LMMs in a surface-to-air mode against Meggitt Banshee target drones. The LMMs in the initial batch use laser beam riding with infrared terminal homing and a laser proximity sensor, although a semi-active laser version is under development for precision surface attack roles. FFLMM/Fury IDEX 2017 In July 2014, Thales unveiled a modification of the LMM that turns it into a glide bomb, called the FreeFall LMM (FFLMM). Thales partnered with Textron to market it as the Fury for the U.S. market, who provides a height-of-burst sensor and electronic safe and arm device. The weapon had been in development for 18 months and undergone initial test drops in August 2013. In comparison to the LMM, the FFLMM removes the rocket motor and associated components while keeping the body and control actuators, as well as adding inertial navigation system and GPS navigation, semi-active laser guidance in place of the beam-riding system, and four enlarged fins for increased lift. The bomb is not intended to replace larger munitions, but be used as a smaller and cheaper alternative to self-propelled missiles, with three bombs able to fit on a single Hellfire missile rail. It is 70 cm (28 in) long, weighs 5.8 kg (12.7 lb), and uses a dual-effect shaped charge and pre- fragmented blast warhead for use against armoured vehicles, small boats, and personnel, with an operational range of when launched at . A potential role for the Fury could be to arm medium intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) UAVs like the RQ-7 Shadow to deal with fleeting or time- sensitive targets.Thales Reveals 6-Kg Glide Bomb For UAVs - Aviationweek.com, 14 July 2015Mini-Munitions Drawing Big Attention - Defensenews.com, 14 July 2014 Surface to surface testing In early 2019 HMS Sutherland tested a modified mounting for the 30mm Automated Small Calibre Gun which incorporated a launcher for five Martlet LMMs, by firing four of them at a small speedboat target at the Aberporth range in Wales. The concept of mounting the missile alongside the 30mm Bushmaster cannon was tested just 5 months after the idea's conception. The intended role of the Martlet is to further extend the Type 23 frigate's capabilities against small, fast moving targets beyond the current 30mm, general purpose machine gun and Minigun options to provide a long range \\"stand-off\\" ability. As of 2019 it was not clear whether the Royal Navy intends to equip any more Type 23s with the system.

In ancient times, it was called Le tea. During the Tang dynasty, it was used as tribute to the emperor. Cloud tea grows in the area of Guangji Temple, Tiefu Temple and Huagai Peak at an altitude of with a mild and wet climate. Meanwhile, rich organic matter in the soil is extremely suitable for the tea's growth. The Chinese great tea master, Lu Yu () in the Tang Dynasty, once mentioned it in The Classic of Tea, which provides for the reputation of cloud tea in Le Mountain. In general, it is famous not only for its thin leaf and beauty, but also the fresh colour, cool taste and attractive smell. It has won an outstanding reputation in both Hunan Province and abroad. Legend It is said that Sun Wukong, the \\"Monkey King\\" (referred to in Journey to the West), often ate peaches and drank wine on Huaguo Mountain. One day he tired of his usual food and drink, and decided to go to heaven to enjoy the tea usually enjoyed only by the emperor and the heavenly queen mother. In the sky as he flew towards heaven, he saw a branch of a tea tree which he did not recognize. It was harvest time, but the Monkey King had no idea how to harvest the tea. Thankfully, a flock of birds passed by and asked the king what was the matter. The king said that he thought Huaguo Mountain was nice, but lamented its lack of tea trees. Hearing this, the birds helped him to harvest tea seeds. Each bird carried some seeds towards Huaguo Mountain. They passed through the high mountains, through the clouds and along the river. While they were flying above the Mount Lu, they were struck by its majesty and could not help singing. As a result of their distraction, they dropped their seeds dropped on Mount Lu. Tea trees soon took root, and grew evermore on the cloudy mountain. Brief introduction Cloud tea belongs to the green tea family. With a standard of one bud, one leaf about 3 centimetres, it is usually picked from Grain Rain (6th solar term) to Beginning of Summer (7th solar term). After a series of complex processes, the finished tea looks lustrous and beautiful. Kinds Lushan cloud tea Mount Lu is known as a respite from summer heat. After enjoying the charming views and climbing, some people choose to have a cup of Lushan Cloud tea (Chinese:Â∫êÂ±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂) to relax their tired bodies. It is also known by its ancient name, Hear Forest tea (Chinese:ÈóªÊûóËå∂). According to legend, the earliest Lushan cloud tea is a wild tea. When a monk, Huiyuan, in Donglin Temple transformed it into a home tea, the Lushan cloud tea started to be grown by hand. Huiyuan often invited his friends to study and chat with a cup of tea he had planted himself. From this origin, the reputation of Lushan cloud tea grew, and became a tribute to the emperor during Song Dynasty. Yingshan cloud tea Yingshan cloud tea (Chinese:Ëã±Â±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂) is mainly produced in Heaven Village near the Dabie Mountains in the north-east of Hubei Province. Wrapped by green trees and wreathed by clouds, the environment and climate are ideal for creating high-quality cloud tea. Yingshan cloud tea is credited by its proponents with refreshing heads and releasing worries, weight loss, clearing the mind, reducing high blood pressure and even treating cancer. These claims are not scientifically supported at this time. Yuntaishan cloud tea Yuntaishan cloud tea (Chinese:‰∫ëÂè∞Â±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂), like Lianyungang cloud tea, has a reputation for its special smell, appearance, taste and fragrance. However, a tree may only produce 1 to 2 kilograms per year. Therefore it is treasured, and can only be served to distinguished guests. Others Other cloud tea varieties include Moganshan cloud tea (Chinese:Ëé´Âπ≤Â±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂), Yandangshan cloud tea (Chinese:ÈõÅËç°Â±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂), Putuoshan cloud tea (Chinese:ÊôÆÈôÄÂ±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂) and Wuyishan cloud tea (Chinese:Ê≠¶Â§∑Â±±‰∫ëÈõæËå∂), etc. Each variety is credited with special characteristics due to the different geographical positions and climate conditions of each growing region.

Life Born into a viticultural family at Vouvray-sur- Loire, Chabot trained at the seminary in Tours where he was ordained. Appointed as assistant priest to La Chapelle-sur-Loire in 1885, he served for two years before becoming a student of Thomas Joseph Lamy (1827‚Äì1907) at Louvain Catholic University in Belgium.\\"Chabot, Abb√© Jean-Baptiste\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 28 His thesis published in Latin in 1892 was devoted to Isaac of Nineveh and included three unpublished homilies from British Museum manuscripts which Chabot translated. He then studied at the School for Higher Studies at the Sorbonne, and under Rubens Duval whose collaborator he became. In 1893 Chabot published catalogues of Syriac manuscripts preserved at the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and of Syriac manuscripts acquired by the French Biblioth√®que Nationale since 1874 (i.e. subsequent to the Zotenberg catalogue). Other catalogues of Oriental manuscripts in the possession of the Eastern Churches were to follow. An early student of the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (founded partly to fill the gap caused by the suppression of the Sorbonne Theology faculty) Chabot worked on the fourth part of the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre, which he published in 1895. Between 1897 and 1900 he published a French translation of John bar Kaldun's Life of Joseph Busnaya. Four years later he obtained a copy of the original Syriac version of Michael the Syrian's Universal Chronicle, which had been rediscovered in a church at Edessa in 1887 by Ephrem Rahmani, subsequently patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. This led to the publication of four volumes of text with Latin translation in 1899, 1901, 1905, 1910 with a follow-up consisting of introduction, corrections and indices in 1924. In 1903 Chabot founded the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium, which he directed single-handed for ten years, supervising the publication of 70 original texts in the four languages initially planned, i.e.; Syriac, Coptic, Arabic and Ethiopian, and personally editing a series of further Syriac chronicles (including the invaluable Documenta ad Illustrandas Monophysitarum Origines 1908) together with the first part of the surviving Syriac version of Cyril of Alexandria's Commentary on St. Luke's Gospel 1912 and (with A. Vaschalde) James of Edessa's Hexaemeron 1928. Chabot remained Secretary general of the C.S.C.O., though responsibility passed in 1913 to the Universities of Washington and Louvain, throughout his lifetime. He contributed a number of articles to the Catholic Encyclopedia on Semitic and Syriac languages. In 1917 Chabot was elected a member of the French Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In 1922 he published Choix d' inscriptions de Palmyre, a major work on Palmyrene Aramaic texts, and in 1935 a general introduction, Litt√©rature Syriaque. He died in Paris, aged 87.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History Side Bridge deck In 1884, the village of Ramsay (now an unincorporated community) began developing around Hubbard and Weed's sawmill on the Black River. The mill burned in 1889, but by that time Ramsay was home to the company headquarters of and workers from the nearby Castile Mining Company. At the turn of the century, Ramsay's Main Street was carried over the Black River by an older truss bridge; by the end of the 1910s, the bridge was deteriorating and was a bottleneck for vehicular traffic. The Gogebic County Road Commission asked the state to help fund a replacement bridge, and in 1922 engineers from the Michigan State Highway Department designed a bridge to span the Black river, designating it Bridge File No. 270103. A contract for $19,455.14 was awarded to Paul N. Massie of nearby Bessemer, who completed construction in 1923. Since that time, the Main Street‚ÄìBlack River Bridge has been essentially unaltered, and continues to carry vehicular traffic. Description The Main Street‚ÄìBlack River Bridge is a concrete through girder bridge, with a main span length of and a complete structure length of . The structure is wide, of which is the roadway. Three concrete girders carry the roadway: a central girder, and two girders on each end. The girders sit on tapered concrete piers. Panels are recessed in the girder walls, which are capped with heavy concrete corbels. Bronze plates stating \\"State Reward Bridge\\" are mounted on each sidewall. Significance By 1923, the concrete through girder bridge design used for the Main Street‚ÄìBlack River Bridge was a well-tested standard design. The Michigan State Highway Department had first delineated this type of structure in 1913-14, and used them for \\"spans from thirty to fifty feet in both the eighteen and twenty-foot clear roadway from curb to curb,\\" as stated in their Seventh Biennial Report. The Highway Department used this design until about 1930, and in that span designed and built perhaps hundreds of them through the state. Most of this type of bridge were single-span structures; the triple- span design and tapered piers of the Main Street‚ÄìBlack River Bridge mark it as a noteworthy example of the design's potential. The bridge is visually striking when views from the river, and is historically important for enabling local vehicular transportation. Other than minor concrete spalling, the bridge is essentially unaltered and remains in good condition.

Contribution to historical discourse  Afghanistan has been in conflict for decades but there has rarely been a place for citizens to reflect on the events of war and how it has affected them. As many Afghans have not received a formal education, they don't necessarily know why their ancestors fought against the Soviets. School texts tend to stop at the 1970s as to not aggravate tensions. The exhibits depict the brutality and human effects of war through the murals, diorama and inscription of names surrounding the rotunda. This message of the horror of war permeates the museum. The creators were careful to depoliticize the exhibits by not depicting the jihadist battles that followed the war with the Soviets. Visitors can ponder how they want their history to progress following the end of the NATO combat mission in 2014.

Listed at , , she batted and threw right-handed. Marilyn Jones was a better pitcher than hitter during her seven seasons in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Her switch from catcher to pitcher kept her in the circuit, even though she was a career .158 hitter. A member of a champion team, Jones hurled a no-hitter and posted a 31‚Äì26 record with a 2.31 earned run average and a minuscule 0.98 WHIP in 69 pitching appearances, even though she pitched mostly for poor teams and suffered from lack of run support.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Jones began playing softball at age 12. She went on to play in an industrial softball league at age 16 with the Monowatt Electric Company, where she worked. After that she played for an independent softball team called the Riverside Townies, where she was discovered by an AAGPBL scout who contacted her parents about her playing in the league. Jones tried out in New Jersey in 1948 and was selected to assist at spring training camp at Opa-locka, Florida.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. ◊¥Jonesy◊¥, as her teammates called her, entered the league in 1948 with the Kenosha Comets, and would be used as a backup for catcher Dorothy Naum. She appeared in 25 games, managing only 2 hits in 50 at bats for a paltry .040 batting average. The next season she was sent to the Chicago Colleens development team to acquire more hitting experience. She was promoted to the Rockford Peaches in 1950, which earned her more playing time under the rookie rule, because each team had to have a rookie in the roster during the regular season. Late in the season, regular catcher Ruth Richard broke a leg in a home-plate collision and Jones was called on to catch in the postseason. Rockford defeated Kenosha in the first round, 3 games to 1, and disposed of the Fort Wayne Daisies in the final round, 4 games to 3.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record BookThe Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Jones opened 1951 with Rockford but was traded to the Battle Creek Belles during the midseason. In 1952, she was asked to pitch because the Belles had two injured pitchers and also had catcher Rita Briggs. She responded with a 9‚Äì7 mark and a 1.69 ERA in 17 games, ending third in the league for the best ERA behind South Bend Blue Sox's Jean Faut (0.93) and Kalamazoo Lassies' Gloria Cordes (1.44). Ironically, the second game that Jones pitched came against her former Daisies teammates on July 10. She pitched a 1‚Äì0 no-hitter against them, silencing a powerful lineup that included Wilma Briggs, Delores Brumfield, Thelma Eisen, Betty Foss, Katie Horstman, Dorothy Schroeder, Kathryn Vonderau and Joanne Weaver. In another memorable game, she lost a duel to Faut and the Blue Sox by a 1‚Äì0 score. The franchise was renamed the Muskegon Belles after moving in 1953. Jones had another good season for her club, going 14‚Äì11 with a 2.56 ERA in 30 games, even though the Belles finished in last place with a 39‚Äì70 record. In addition, Jones ranked sixth in complete games (22), seventh in strikeouts (86) and eight in wins. When the Lassies folded up before the 1954 season, she returned to Fort Wayne, where she finished with an 8‚Äì8 record and helped the Daisies win the regular season pennant. After the league folded in 1954, Jones worked for Michigan Bell Telephone Company for almost 32 years and also played for the Kalamazoo Lassies, a basketball team in the city composed of several All-Americans. In 1969, she married Bud Doxey, a softball umpire and former player, and raised two stepsons. She retired in 1983, while her husband died in 1999. In 1988 she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. It was not really a well known fact until filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her 1992 film A League of Their Own, which was a fictionalized account of activities in the AAGPBL. Starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty and Rosie O'Donnell, this film brought many of the real AAGPBL former players a rebirth of celebrity.

Set in 2032, the novel depicts a highly militarized future where there is severe conflict in the Middle East. A reviewer in the Los Angeles Times favorably compared the novel to Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II's Seven Days in May. Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"A book that paints an all-too-plausible future in which America outsources its dirtiest jobs.\\" Plot The novel follows the actions of a soldier-mercenary named Gentilhomme from Louisiana who follows the prolific, Caesar-like, General Salter, who himself commands a mercenary army after he has been disgraced and exiled from the U.S. 'Gent', for short, is ordered to Egypt to find his old comrade and friend 'El Masri' to aid on a mission into Tajikistan, where a new oil field has been discovered. At first their orders are to eliminate one warlord and put his son into power in Tajikistan, thus brokering a deal in which Salter will have some control over the rights of the newly discovered oil. However, upon learning of the news that the elder warlord has already been killed, their orders are changed. They eliminate the younger warlord, thus leaving the nation leaderless and in chaos, creating a vacuum that China and Russia rush into and keep them blind from other affairs. Meanwhile, Salter has taken control of all Saudi Arabian oil reserves and pipelines, strategically rigging them with explosives to be used if threatened. Salter effectively becomes the most powerful man in the world and begins bargaining away rights to the highest bidders. He hopes to seek revenge against those who had him exiled years ago and also return home as a hero and supreme commander in chief. Gent, Salter's most loyal soldier and the closest thing to a son he has had since his own son's death, is the only man that can stop him. Themes As per most Pressfield books, there are several reoccurring themes that are present in The Profession as well. There is, as always, the theme of warriors uniting in fraternity and under a mystic warrior code. This dynamic is especially strong between Gent and El Masri. A minor theme is that of reincarnation, or re-occurrence of events, that seem to always find their characters through fate. For example, Gent narrates that he has always had a specific dream that in the end was his destiny in one life and one lived thousands of years before. There are also references to Alexander the Great which has been the subject of several of Pressfield's novels. There is a theme of liberty versus empire that is depicted in this novel and manifested in Gent, who has difficulty deciding between the two. It parallels the difficulties of the Roman Empire with the gain of Imperial power at the expense of liberty and freedom of the people. At the end of the novel, the United States republic has a similar end as did the Roman republic and Salter is even likened to Julius Caesar.

Tess Daulton is also an uncredited co-writer. The story follows Tiny, a music hall (vaudeville) performer, Arnold Hugh, a silent film actor, and Tiny's co-worker Daphne, as they attempt to adjust to the coming age of film. Tiny, Arnold and the Organist are voiced by Graham Fellows, and Daphne is voiced by an uncredited Tess Daulton. The short film is eleven minutes in length, and won a BAFTA Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1998.BAFTA Awards Database - Best Animated Short Film, bafta.org. Retrieved 17 March 2012.  Plot  Tiny, a dog trainer, hides with his dogs in a wicker basket on the stage of an abandoned vaudeville theater. He emerges to have them practice a trick, attacking a tattered straw boater hat on command. When a second man, Arnold Hugh, emerges menacingly onto the stage, Tiny fearfully backs away from him and falls into the orchestra pit, getting his clothes snagged on a broken plank. Years earlier, Tiny had found one of his dogs missing while performing his trained-dog act in the theater. Even though he fears that the crowd no longer likes the act, his friend Daphne encourages him to go on with the show. He is booed off the stage in favor of a silent movie, which stars Arnold and Daphne and features the missing dog, taken by Daphne. Arnold pressures her not to tell Tiny about the theft and goes on to make a string of successful movies with Daphne and the dogs. Tiny trains the dogs to jump up and place a boater on his head at his command. When Arnold uses this trick in one of his movies, though, it fails because he is taller than Tiny; he angrily confronts Tiny and threatens to torture the animals unless they can reach his height. Angered, Tiny re-trains them to attack instead, prompting Arnold to leave the studio for the confrontation seen at the beginning of the film. Daphne decides that she no longer wants to work with Arnold and follows him to the theater. Daphne swings a sandbag across the stage, knocking Arnold down, and confesses her involvement to Tiny. Arnold gets up and begins to strangle Daphne, but Tiny delivers his attack command and the dogs advance menacingly toward him. Arnold pulls a metal latch off the wall to use as a weapon, triggering the movie screen to come down on his head and he kicks the bucket. Daphne sees no sign of Tiny when she turns back to the orchestra pit, but he is lifted into view on the organ that had been used to provide background music for Arnold's movies. It now glows white, being played by a spectral organist; Tiny climbs off, unhurt, but Arnold's spirit rises from his body and steps on at the organist's beckoning. The organ then swiftly drops out of sight, carrying a terrified Arnold down to the Underworld. As the theater begins to collapse, Daphne persuades Tiny to overcome his fear of rejection and leave with her. They and the dogs exit into the light of the outside world.

Scope The term \\"literature\\" as it is used in connection with Old High German has a broader scope than for later periods in the history of German: it is not restricted to imaginative works but encompasses everything written in the language, including prayers and theological works as well as verse narratives. The surviving texts were written exclusively by clerics, in the main monks in a small number of monastic scriptoria, and serve almost entirely the purposes of the church in a region that was still being fully Christianized. Pre-Christian and non-clerical literary traditions are reflected in a small number of works, such as the Hildebrandslied and the charms, but otherwise there is little surviving evidence of the oral culture which must have been present outside clerical circles. The earliest texts date from the second half of the 8th century: translation aids (glosses and glossaries) for those learning to read Latin and translations of Latin Christian texts (prayers, creeds, confessions) for use in missionary or pastoral work among the lay population. Translations and, later, adaptations of Latin Christian texts, continue throughout the period, and are seen in Otfrid's gospel harmony in the 9th century and the extensive works of Notker III in the early 11th century. After Notker, there is gap of some 40 years before evidence of a new tradition of biblical verse in a form of language now called Early Middle High German, which is followed by the flourishing secular literature of Middle High German. Language Map showing the main Old High German scriptoria and the areas of the Old High German \\"monastery dialects\\". The Old High German period sees the first attempts to use the Latin alphabet for writing German, something which Otfrid of Weissenburg, writing c. 830, recognized as fraught with difficulty. As Murdoch explains, \\"Written down without prescriptive rules in more or less isolated monasteries, then, it is to be expected that Old High (and Old Low) German texts show a bewildering amount of linguistic variation.\\" The result is that there is no standard Old High German ‚Äî each text presents a particular dialect (or dialect mixture), and in the absence of contemporary evidence for dialect boundaries, they have been termed \\"monastery dialects\\" (German ). Genres  Epic Poetry  The most famous work in OHG is the Hildebrandslied, a short piece of Germanic alliterative heroic verse which besides the Muspilli is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition.  Lyric Poetry  Works include the short but splendid Ludwigslied, celebrating the victory of the Frankish army, led by Louis III of France, over Danish (Viking) raiders at the Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu on 3 August 881. There is also the incomplete Das Georgslied about the life of Saint George, and the Wessobrunn Prayer, a praise of Creation and a plea for strength to withstand sin.  Other Literature  Works include the Evangelienbuch (Gospel harmony) of Otfried von Weissenburg, the Latin-German dictionary Abrogans, the magical Merseburg Charms and the Old High German translation of the theologian Tatian.

The crew of Flight 706 later reported over the Dover VOR at 09:54 local time. At the time, Flight 706 was climbing through 14,200 feet.

However, there were no answers from Flight 706. Witnesses on the ground saw the tailplane of Flight 706 detached and subsequently Flight 706 entered a nose-dive. The flight kept diving and crashed into farm land near Aarsele, Belgium and exploded on impact. All 55 passengers and 8 crew members were killed. At least one person on the ground was injured after pieces of the debris struck a passing car. Rescue services were immediately dispatched. Investigators were deployed and immediately searched the aircraft's black box. A crisis center was set up in Salzburg for the relatives of the victims of Flight 706. Searchers stated that most of the bodies were not intact. One searcher said ‚Äúas for the bodies, what we have found so far is barely enough to reconstitute one body.‚Äù Passengers and crews The aircraft was carrying 55 passengers and 8 crew members. News report stated that there were 37 British passengers on board the aircraft. At least 4 Japanese and 11 Americans were also on board the aircraft. Further reports also confirmed the presence of 8 Austrians on board the flight. Two notable fatalities among the passengers were the British hat designer Otto Lucas and an Austrian academic, . The Captain was identified as 40 year old Captain E.T Probert. At the time of the accident, he had accumulated a total flying hours of 9,260 hours, in which 1,927 hours were on the type. The co-pilot was 38 year old J.M Davies, who held a Vickers Vanguard rating. He had a total flying hours of 3,386 hours, in which 764 hours were on the type. The aircraft was also carrying a third pilot, identified as 27 year old B.J.S Barnes with a total flying hours of 2,237 hours, in which 1,903 hours were on the type and a supernumerary, identified as Captain G. Partridge. Investigation Witnesses on the ground recalled that the Vanguard suddenly exploded in mid-air, lost one of its wings, and plunged onto the ground, with smoke pouring out from one of its wings. They stated that they heard strange noises during the crash. According to them, the aircraft touched down in one field, jumped a road, and plowed through grassland for 500 yards. It gouged into the ground and burst into flames in a pit 15 feet deep. One of the witness stated, ‚ÄúThe fire spread from the wreckage like waves,\\" Police said eyewitness reports indicated that Captain Probert had tried to execute an emergency landing. There was considerable suspicion that the aircraft had been sabotaged by extremists. A BEA spokesman claimed that the aircraft was sabotaged by Northern Ireland extremists. The Vanguard had been used on the London‚ÄêBelfast route, though he said the plane had not been on Belfast service for at least 48 hours and was stored in Edinburgh on Friday. However, after a preliminary investigation by William Trench, one of the investigators from AIB, stated that at the time there was no hint that sabotage played a part in the crash. Flight recorder analysis Investigators recovered the flight recorder from the crash site. The flight recorder was later taken to United Kingdom for further analysis. After investigators downloaded the content, they found that the recordings stopped abruptly while the aeroplane was still in mid-air. Investigators concluded that a sudden explosive decompression caused this abrupt stop of the recordings. Structural failure rear pressure bulkhead Detailed examination showed that the failure of the rear pressure bulkhead started the sequence of structural failure of Flight 706. The rapid inflation of the tailcone and empennage imposed a high differential pressure across the tailplane skin. This caused the upper panel to become detached from the main structure. The aircraft's flight load then caused the rapid break up and separation of the aircraft's tailplane from its main body. This separation of the tailplane caused the aircraft to pitch rapidly nose down. Investigators stated that recovery from this dive was impossible. Investigators found severe corrosion at the joint of the fuselage skin and the rear pressure bulkhead. This crack was hidden and probably was not detected by maintenance crew for a period of time. The crack was probably developed after a long period, evidenced by the presence of nicotine tar stains found on the crack. Further analysis from the nature of the progressive tear marks on the fracture surfaces suggests that the period was short. Investigators concluded that the crack affected the structural integrity of the aircraft. Inspection In their final report, investigators stated, > \\"The approved maintenance schedule called for visual inspection of the > bulkhead at relatively long intervals. This approach assumed that the > bonding paint and sealing schemes remained intact and effective. In fact, > delamination accompanied by corrosion can occur between the redux bonded > doubler and the front face of the pressure bulkhead. The corrosion attack > may be severe before any visual indication is apparent at the edge of the > bonded doubler.\\" Examination from the aircraft's maintenance record showed that maintenance crew had conducted a radiographic examination of the rear pressure bulkhead of the aircraft prior to the accident. However, investigators questioned the effectiveness of the technique. The technique used to examine this particular area (the rear pressure bulkhead) of the Vanguard has since been demonstrated to be ineffective as a sure means of detecting corrosion. This is because of the difficulty of interpreting the photographic plate details resulting from the complex structure. With the inspection technique then in use, investigators concluded that the corrosion on the aircraft was not detectable. The crack was located near the toilet of the aircraft. Investigators stated that they found liquid around the crack. Appreciable amounts of liquids had been retained at various times in the structure aft of the rear pressure bulkhead. Because of BEA practice of employing personnel to clean the aircraft, this could cause the inspector to be unaware of possible fluid contamination on the aircraft. Conclusion Investigators finally concluded the cause of the accident, and stated, > \\"The accident was caused by the rupture of the rear pressure bulkhead, which > led to the separation both tailplanes in flight and caused the aircraft to > dive into the ground,\\" Aftermath British European Airways immediately implemented a new technique in detecting corrosion.

Alfred E. Stone was born on July 29, 1834, in East Machias, Maine, to Rev. Thomas Treadwell Stone and Laura Poor Stone. He attended the Washington Academy in East Machias until the family moved to Salem, Massachusetts .Proceedings of the Rhode Island Historical Society, 1908-1909. Providence: Standard Printing Co., 1910. While attending high school in Salem, he studied drawing and surveying. He graduated from high school in 1850. In 1852 he began his architectural training in the office of Towle & Foster. A few years later he moved to the office of Shepard S. Woodcock. In 1855 he moved again, to Washburn & Brown. He left the following year and began working for Arthur Gilman.\\"Alfred Stone, F. A. I. A.\\" American Institute of Architects Quarterly Bulletin April 1908: 200. While there, he designed the Hotel Pelham in Boston.Jean A.

In 1859 Stone moved to Providence and entered the office of Alpheus C. Morse, where he studied architecture until the outbreak of the Civil War.\\"Death of Architect Alfred Stone\\". Carpentry and Building Oct. 1908: 344. Stone married Ellen Maria Putnam in Salem in 1864. Career and later life In 1864 Stone founded his own architectural firm in Providence, and then partnered with W. H. Emmerton in 1866. Emmerton was killed in a railroad accident in 1871. In 1873, Stone promoted longtime employee Charles E. Carpenter to partner, forming the firm of Stone & Carpenter. In 1882, the firm took on a recent Beaux-Arts graduate, Edmund R. Willson. Impressed with his work, Stone and Carpenter promoted him to junior partner in 1883. He was promoted to full partner a few years later, and the firm became Stone, Carpenter & Willson. Walter G. Sheldon became a partner in 1901. Willson died in 1906. By 1907, the firm had been reorganized as Stone, Carpenter & Sheldon. The firm retained this name even after Stone's death in 1908. The firm soon lost its prestige, and was left to residential and alteration work. It disappeared soon after Carpenter's death in 1923. Stone had a keen interest in land use issues in the Providence area. In the late nineteenth century he played a key role in guiding the expansion of Swan Point Cemetery, continuing the precepts of the original design. He served as the cemetery Director and the last 12 years as President, from 1876 until his death.Swan Point Cemetery website, http://swanpointcemetery.com/notable-people.php , accessed 8/3/12. It was Stone who convinced his fellow cemetery directors to construct Blackstone Boulevard (built 1892-1894), as an easy means of getting to the cemetery. Alfred E. Stone died at the home of his niece on September 4, 1908, in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. A city street is named in Stone's honor.

The manga was serialized in Gangan Online and was released in seven manga volumes between May 21, 2009 and September 27, 2012. A twelve-episode anime series produced by Sunrise aired between January 9 and March 26, 2012. The anime was licensed by NIS America for release in North America and Hanabee Entertainment in Australia. A live-action film directed by Daigo Matsui was released by Showgate in Japan on October 12, 2013. Plot The story revolves around the daily lives of Tadakuni, Hidenori Tabata and Yoshitake Tanaka of Sanada North Boys High school and their various interactions with other students of and around their school and their coming of age endeavors. Characters Main characters ; : :Actor: Masaki Suda :A student in Sanada North Boys High who acts as the straight man of the group. He is usually involved in Hidenori and Yoshitake's wild ideas despite his disapproval. He is good at telling \\"ghost\\" stories, though most of the time he makes them up. He has a younger sister whom he hardly talks to and is stronger than him and his friends. He also works part-time at a pizza restaurant. Despite being introduced like a main protagonist, he gets the fewest roles of the trio. In the anime, it is explained that he was there for most of the trio's adventures, but even though the show is about the daily lives of high school students, the editors only want the 'interesting' lives of high school students. He is cut to save time, and thus rarely appears throughout the second half of the series. His last name is never revealed. ; : :Actor: Sh≈´hei Nomura :The dyed hair character of the main trio, he usually goes along with Hidenori's scheme much to Tadakuni's disapproval. He was Rubber Shooter in the past and had fought against Habara along with Yanagin and Karasawa in that identity. Rubber Shooter first appears in episode 5. Back in elementary school, he had many embarrassing moments that his friends had mistaken to be for Mitsuo. He has a violent sister who is a year older than him. ; : :Actor: Ryo Yoshizawa :The glasses-wearing character of the main trio and also a student of Sanada North Boys High, he is the one that usually gets the group involved in his crazy schemes. He used to be bullied in the past until he was saved by Rubber Shooter. His older brother, Y≈´suke used to be the ringleader of the group until he went off to college. He is also always the main target of literature girl. Sanada North High School ; : :Actor: Taiga :Often referred to by his family name, he is a member of Sanada North High student council, he is stiff and kind but can act lecherously at times. He is also Habara's neighbour and is a target of Yanagin and Ikushima's harassments during the Funky High School Girls meetings, but he always has ways to deal with them. He also has a facial scar between his eyes that he got from the Archdemon when he was in elementary school, which he covers with a cap. Since then he has been fearful of Habara. ; : :A member of Sanada North High student council. He has an intimidating look that is often mistaken as a delinquent, although he is actually gentle and shy. He was bullied by his older sister since he was young, however he gives in and maintains a good relationship with her. Although his older sister usually cooks dinner for them, he can actually cook better than her, much to her envy. ; : :Student Council President of Sanada North High. Despite his good looks and charisma, he is quite laid back and lets the Vice-President handle most of the everyday student council tasks. He initiates the link with the student council of Sanada East High, leading to his mutual rivalry and later admiration with Ringo. The Vice President sees him as a father figure of sorts. ; : :Actor: Akihiro Kakuta :Student Council Vice-President of Sanada North High. His dyed hair, tanned skin and old appearance are often mistaken for an old-time delinquent, but in reality he is kind and gentle. He did however used to be wild as his appearance suggests, but this changed after he was invited into the student council by the current President. He is actually a year younger than the other council members and he becomes President after they all graduate. ; : :Actor: Koshiro Higashimukai :Classmate of the main cast and is prone to mishaps yet friendly most of the time. He once trains with Hidenori to get into the soccer team but ends up playing rugby as a regular. His classmates always talk about his embarrassing moments in school even though they are not always actually his. Funky High School Girls : An alternative female version of the High School Boys, which is usually featured near the end of the episode. Some of them often appear in the regular show but without eyes like Tadakuni and Yoshitake's sister. ; : :Actor: Mizuki Yamamoto :The bespectacled and tomboyish girl of the group. She is good academically and proficient in karate. Full of crazy ideas and prone to violent outbursts. She was once part of the elementary school's strongest warriors to fight against Archdemon. After the battle, she was selected to monitor Habara and ended up being friends with her until now. She attends Sanada Central High. ; : :Actor: Toko Miura :The twin tails of the group and also a student of Sanada East Girls High. She usually goes along with Yanagin and her wild ideas. ; : :Actor: Kasumi Yamaya :The most normal high school girl of the group but not quite so in the past. Back in elementary school she had a fearsome look and was a huge bully in the neighborhood, earning her the moniker Archdemon. She eventually mellowed out after the local elementary school's ten strongest warriors managed to fight her to a draw. She was also responsible for Karasawa's facial scar and seeks to make it up to him even though he is still scared of her. Even now, despite usually acting normal, she still thinks fighting needs no rules and should be to the death and would not hesitate to literally kill her friends with a rock if they challenged her. She attends Sanada West High and is acquainted with Yassan. Other characters ; : :A beautiful and soft-spoken long haired girl from Sanada West High which is a novel writer who is usually seen at the river bank looking for people who might fit into the role of her novel. She seems to be interested in the trio, particularly Hidenori, who has the most encounters with her and amuses her with novelly lines the most (or at least, tries to). She is also extremely clumsy, over imaginative, and often making a fool of herself. Although her real name was never truly revealed, those who know her addressed her as Yassan. ; : :Actor: Anri Okamoto :The Student Council President of Sanada East High. She is full of pride and has a short temper. But she can be a bit of an airhead, which leads her to getting easily tricked, like mistaking Karasawa's snoring for a cat's meow and standing on a step ladder in the Student Council room to connect an intentionally unplugged cable whilst the boys peeked at her panties. She becomes increasingly close with Sanada North High Student Council and hints at signs of feelings for the President, in spite of their initial hostility which had led to a street fight at the School Festival. She is actually popular and is usually hit on, much to her ignorance. ; : :Actor: Sara Takatsuki :Addressed by Yoshitake's older sister as \\"Mei-chan\\". A girl who always appears faceless and loathes Tadakuni and his male friends, but is often caught eavesdropping on their conversations and apparently has absolute faith in her brother's honesty, as she takes whatever he says at face value. She acts violently towards her brother and his friends, though she favors Karasawa. She attends Sanada Central High. ; : :The faceless, short-haired sister of Yoshitake who does not get along with her brother. Strong and violent, she is the ringleader of the girls who shave off Motoharu's beard. She went to Sanada Central High before graduating half way through the show. She is also highly concerned about not getting a boyfriend. She has a crush on Hidenori's older brother, Y≈´suke, who calls her \\"Tanaka\\". ; : :Motoharu's older sister. She is always seen asking Motoharu what to have for dinner and usually cooks for her brother since their parents are not at home. She gets along well with Motoharu unlike most of the other siblings (even though she also loved to bully Motoharu in the past). She went to Sanada West High before graduating half way through the show. ; : :He is the classmate of Yassan. He also lives close to Habara's home and was bullied by Habara in elementary school. He often talks about girls with his classmates from Sanada West High ; : :Fellow part-timer at the same pizza place that Tadakuni works for, she has a complex for her looks. When she takes off her glasses and opens her eyes wide, her reflection from a convex mirror makes her look like a completely different person. She goes to the same school as Yanagin and holds the position of number one grade-wise, while Yanagin is number two. ; :Another coworker of Tadakuni's at the pizza restaurant. He claims that he is pretty popular and, like Tadakuni, hopes to one day see the girl in the convex mirror one more time. ; : :The older brother of Hidenori and former leader of the main cast. Yoshitake's older sister, Tanaka, has a crush on him, but he prefers not to get close to her. He tries to set Tanaka up with one of his college friends, but has difficulty since almost all of them are perverts. ; :Hidenori's father. Supposedly he wanted to be a pilot when he was young. He is pretty blunt and turns out to be just as thick headed as his two sons. ; : :A rich young lady that appears for a short sketch after the ED song of Episode 2. She has a crown tooth that her butlers (Nagase, Asano, and Toyogawa) are afraid will fall out. ; : :A girl with tanned skin who met Hidenori during a summer when he went to visit his grandparents. She spent the summer hanging out with Hidenori and Kiyohiko and developed feelings for Hidenori. Just before she was going to confess her feelings, Hidenori revealed that, unbeknownst to her, they are actually cousins. ; : :Emi's childhood friend who lives next door to her. ; : :An old friend of Hidenori and Tadakuni. He currently goes to Chuuou High School. ; :The principal of Sanada North High is a very nice old man who refuses to turn his students away even if he does not know the answer to their questions. ;Nameless Characters :Some recurring characters do not have names, like the Funky High School girls' senpai who tries but ultimately fails to make Yanagin and Ikushima to be cute; Yassan's classmate who enjoys rejecting guys on the train (and also ends up accidentally thinking at one point or another that each member of the main trio likes her); Mitsuo and Motoharu's two fellow classmates/close friends, and avid video game fans, who they have (as well as Hidenori and Yoshitake) known since elementary school; Takahiro's closest friend who talks to him about girls; The main trio's sensei; and Ringo-chan's fellow council members. Media Manga The manga was first published by Square Enix in the web magazine Gangan Online on May 21, 2009 and ended its run on September 27, 2012. It was later compiled into seven tank≈çbon volumes and published between February 22, 2010 and September 27, 2012. The ending is different from the anime. =Volume list= Anime An anime adaptation produced by Sunrise and directed by Shinji Takamatsu was announced in October 2011 and premiered on TV Tokyo on January 9, 2012. This was followed by later airings on AT-X, Bandai Channel, TVA, TVO and online streaming on Niconico. The series was later released on six Blu-ray and DVD volumes in Japan between April 3 and September 4, 2012 and included special bonus episodes along with the episodes that were streamed on Niconico prior to the television premiere of the anime. The series was also licensed by NIS America. The company released the series in its entirety with English subtitles on a two-disc Blu-ray premium edition package on August 6, 2013. Hanabee Entertainment also announced that they had licensed the anime for release in Australia. This was followed by a DVD release on July 31, 2013. Hulu eventually picked the series up for online streaming in the United States in 2013. Daily Lives of High School Boys uses three pieces of theme music: one insert song, one opening theme and one closing theme. The insert song is \\"Capsule\\" by Mix Speakers, Inc and was used in episode three. The main opening theme for all episodes is \\"Shiny tale\\" by Mix Speakers, Inc while the ending theme is by Amesaki Annainin. The original ending theme was supposed to be by Jinkaku Radio. However the song was quickly pulled after the band made inappropriate remarks concerning the series on their blog which poked fun at the manga, stating \\"About that Daily Lives of High School Boys thing ... the manga is actually pretty boring (lol)\\". The band's lead vocalist had also previously posted inappropriate remarks about voice actress Yui Horie. This later prompted an apology by Jinkaku Radio‚Äîvowing to show more \\"self-restraint\\" on social media along with cancellation of the sales of \\"Subtraction\\" and other scheduled events. Drama CD There are six volumes of Drama CD released. The title is Unseen Daily Lives of High School Boys(Danshi K≈çk≈çsei no Miserarenai Nichij≈ç). These are some randoms gags and other stories. Live-action film A live-action film adaptation produced by Showgate and directed by Daigo Matsui was announced in April 2013 and released on October 12, 2013. The cast includes Masaki Suda as Tadakuni, Sh≈´hei Nomura as Yoshitake and Ryo Yoshizawa as Hidenori. The film follows an original story with the boys of Sanada North holding a joint school festival with the neighboring all-girls high school. Director Matsui remarked that he had spent his high school years in an all-boys school himself and identified with the Daily Lives so much that he began looking at the boys' logic objectively. This made him feel \\"sad and embarrassed\\" and felt as though he made a documentary of his own life at the end of filming. The film was released by Pony Canyon on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan on March 19, 2014.

The Akwasidae Festival (alternate, Akwasiadae) is celebrated by the Ashanti people and chiefs in Ashanti, as well as the Ashanti diaspora. The festival is celebrated on a Sunday, once every six weeks. Observance The Akan annual calendar is divided into nine parts, each lasting approximately six weeks but varying between 40‚Äì42 days in a period; the celebration of this period is called the Adae Festival. The Adae Festival has two celebration days: the Akwasidae Festival is celebrated on the final Sunday of the period, while the Awukudae Festival is celebrated on a Wednesday within the period. The Friday preceding 10 days to the Akwasidae is called the Fofie (meaning a ritual Friday). As the festival is always held on Sundays (Twi in Kwasidae), its recurrence could be after 40 or 42 days in accordance with the official Calendar of Ashanti. During the last Akwasidae of the year, which coincides with the Adae Kese Festival, special attention is given to make food offerings and donations for helping people. The festivals of Adae are not interchangeable as they were fixed from ancient times. Practices The rites on this day relate to honouring personal and community ancestors. A gathering called Akom occurs in which drumming, dancing and singing are a normal celebration to honour Abosom (lesser gods in the Akan tradition) and Nsamanfo (spiritually cultivated ancestors). Food offerings include special items such as eto (mashed African yam), garnished with hard-boiled eggs. Every Ashanti celebrates this festival. For those Ashanti who do not observe the festival of Odwira, the Akwasidae is very important to commemorate their ancestors. On this day, the Asantehene (King of Ashante) meets his subjects and subordinate chiefs in the courtyard of the Manhyia Palace. The Golden Stool (throne) is displayed at the palace grounds in the presence of the king, and people visit in large numbers, singing and dancing. The king holds his durbar on the occasion of the festival, and people have the liberty to shake hands with him. Before holding the durbar, the king goes in a procession in a palanquin decorated with gold jewelry. He also witnesses a colourful parade, from his palace grounds at Kumasi. Participants of the parade include drum beaters, folk dancers, horn- blowers and singers. As it is festival of paying respect to ancestors, the king visits the Bantama Mausoleum and offers worship not only to his ancestors' chairs (stools), but also to the skeletal remains of his ancestors. It is argued that, the king do not worship the stools and the ancestors, however to pay them homage.

Built on the ruins of Haselworth Castle to protect Portsmouth harbour at the start of the American War of Independence, it was rebuilt in the 1880s as a Palmerston fort. History Haselworth Castle (1545-1556) A Henrican fort, variously titled Hasleworth or Haselford, was erected on the site in 1545. The fortification was only lightly armed, and is depicted on the Cowdray Print as a circular keep with an outer wall. The castle was abandoned in 1556, only 11 years after construction, as a result of a review by the Marquis of Winchester. A 1587 map indicates that \\"Hasleworth Castle beaten downe by King Philip\\", potentially in reference to a story about the castle being demolished after it failed to grant Phillip a salute in 1554. The ruins continued to be marked on maps until 1788. There is some dispute as to the exact location of the fortification, but the modern site of Fort Monckton is considered the most probable. No maps produced after the completion of Fort Monckton mark the ruins. Construction (1779-1790) A plan of the fort drawn from original sources Despite several previous plans which noted the exposed nature of Portsmouth harbour to attack, it was not until the American War of Independence that construction of a defensive fort was started on the site in 1779. The Governor of Portsmouth Lt. General Sir Robert Monckton told his Commanding Engineer, Lt. Col. John Archer to draw up plans for the defence of Stokes Bay. In 1779 the Gilkicker Sea Mark was demolished to provide clear ground for a new temporary fort, which consisted of a thick earth bank, supported by brushwood fascines. So poor was the structure, that the tents of the billeted soldiers blew away in 1780, while the site was so exposed that it was used as a sighting point by ships entering Portsmouth harbour. Archer proposed a new permanent structure, which was accepted in July 1780. Known as The Fort at Gilkicker, construction started in September 1780. However, using civilian and often supplemented by conscript labour, construction speed was slow and the design came under criticism from Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, who in 1782 was appointed as Master- General of the Ordnance. After Archer was removed from his post in 1783 construction was taken over by engineer officer James Glenie, who himself was removed in 1784. Construction again slowed, and after much more controversy in its design and naming, it was renamed Fort Monckton after the now deceased Robert Monckton, and completed in 1789 or 1790, just before the French Revolution of 1793. Battery (1790-1956) Some additional work expanding the barracks took place in the early 19th century, to add officer's quarters. A sea wall was added along the beach, along with a northeastern redoubt. Considered too small and old to dominate the key anchorage of Spithead by the 1860 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, they instead opted to build the new Fort Gilkicker and give Fort Monckton a minor defensive role in the defence of Portsmouth harbour. Very little was done to modify the fort during this period apart from reforming the gun positions to take the new armament. The fort was often used as a viewing platform for the fleet reviews as illustrated in the editions of the Illustrated London News for 1856 and 1858. In 1875, experiments were carried out at Stokes Bay with Wilde's Electric Light. The light was placed on the South-west bastion of the fort. More experiments continued with Lime Light and signalling lamps for shore-to- ship communication in July 1875.The Portsmouth News July 1875 The fort was incorporated into the defences of Stokes Bay as an adjunct to the Stokes Bay Lines; the Royal Engineers moved into the fort in 1878 to train in the use of naval mines and later search lights. In 1879, torpedo experiments were carried out at Stokes Bay and part of this consisted of a mock attack on Fort Monckton. This sham attack was recorded in the Illustrated London News.Illustrated London News October 25, 1879 The fort was an ideal viewing platform for the observers and members of the public. In 1880, another demonstration of naval warfare took place in the vicinity of the fort.The Times August 11th 1880 \\"Experimental Naval Attack on Harbour and Fort Defences at Portsmouth\\" In 1880, the 4th Company of Submarine Miners of the Royal Engineers occupied the fort. They moved out in 1884 to Fort Blockhouse, leaving Fort Monckton as accommodation for the R.E. Militia during the annual training. Anti-aircraft searchlights were located in the fort during World War 1 and an anti-aircraft artillery unit was quartered in the fort during World War 2. Virtually abandoned after World War II, the fort was however retained by the Ministry of DefenceThe Western Defences of Portsmouth Harbour 1400-1800 by G.H. Williams Portsmouth Papers No.3 Page 47 and remained armed until the abolition of coastal artillery in 1956. No.1 Military Training Establishment (1956-present) Entrance to Fort Monckton in 2008 Fort Monckton now remains the only fort in the Portsmouth area retained within MoD (Army) ‚Äî as opposed to Royal Navy ‚Äî ownership. Located next to the Stokes Bay Golf Course, much of the original fort still exists including the bastions, sea facing casemates, guard room, one of the caponiers and the ditch. The fort retains its original drawbridge and is additionally protected by modern razor wire security fencing, CCTV cameras and high intensity lighting. The site has been heavily modified with modern offices and accommodation added on and around it, and a portion of the artificial lake was filled in in the 1970s. Security at the site is not undertaken by the MoD Police, but by an in-house civilian guardforce. Now referred to as No.1 Military Training Establishment by the British Army, it is occupied by the Ministry of Defence. In his book The Big Breach, former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson alleges that Fort Monckton is now the Secret Intelligence Service's field operations training centre, where both basic and advanced field training is given to SIS personnel., and liaison training with other services including the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service is undertaken. The site is also referred to as an MI6 training centre in the book \\"Agent Storm\\" by PET announcer Morten Storm. Armament In 1872 the outdated armament was a mixture of smooth bore guns: two 8-inch, nine 32pr, two 24pr, six 18pr, two 12pr all Smooth Bore with two 7-inch Rifled Breech Loading guns.

These were mounted two to each of 1, 2 and 5 Bastions. By this time accommodation within the fort was for eight officers with 70 NCOs and men.

He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Helston October 1553, West Looe April 1554, and Dunheved November 1554. Life He was the son of Christopher Bendlowes of Great Bardfield, in Essex, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Ufford. He was educated for a time at St. John's College, Cambridge; but leaving the university without a degree, he became a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar. In 1548 he was autumn reader of his inn, but did not lecture on account of the pestilence. He was again autumn reader in 1549. He successively represented the Cornish boroughs of Helston, Penrhyn, and Dunheved in the Parliaments which met in the years 1553 to 1554. In 1555 he was double autumn reader at Lincoln's Inn, and was soon afterwards called to the degree of serjeant-at-law, he and the other serjeants included in the same call making their feast in the Inner Temple Hall on 16 October 1555. In the following year he was in a commission for the suppression of Lollards and heretics in Essex. His patrimony in that county was not inconsiderable, and he appears to have greatly increased it. During the latter part of Queen Mary's reign, and the earlier part of Elizabeth's, Bendlowes was the only practising serjeant. He is said to have always adhered steadily to the Roman Catholic faith. In 1576 he became one of the governors of Lincoln's Inn, and he served the office in several succeeding years. The recorder Fleetwood, in a letter to Lord Burghley, relates that on the occasion of the investiture of Sir Edmund Anderson as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in May 1582, the Lord Chancellor (Hatton) \\"made a short discourse, what the dewtie and office of a good justice was\\"; and that after the Chief Justice was sworn, \\"Father Benloos, because he was auncient, did put a short case, and then myself put the next\\". Bendlowes died on 19 November 1584 and was buried at Great Bardfield. In the combination room of St. John's College, Cambridge, there is a half-length portrait of Serjeant Bendlowes, \\"solus ad legem serviens, aet. suae 49, et sui gradus an. anno, 1564\\".

The festival is used to mark the migration of the people Notsie in Togo in the 17th Century to their present location in the south east of Ghana. The migration occurred because the people were fed up with the rule of Togbe Agorkoli. The people therefore use the festival to commemorate the heroics of their ancestors who devised a secret escape through a hole they dug in the wall that surrounded the Notsie town. Another reason for the celebration of the festival is for the people to honour certain ancestors who played leading roles in their secret escape. Other activities Various other activities of mutual benefit to the Ve people and visitors during the celebrations are held. They include fund raising activities to raise monies for needed development projects in education and health. The Ve Educational Endowment Fund was established in 2001 to support brilliant but needy students in the area. Another activity that is organized is Public health issues awareness. During organized fora, various health issues including malaria and HIV are highlighted. Various sporting games such as soccer matches are also organized. Developmental projects During the festival, the state of development projects is made known during the annual durbar. New projects are also initiated. During one of such durbars, it was announced that Ve-Lukusi Improvement Society had purchased a 15-acre lot in the area to construct a replica wall to mirror the one through which their ancestors escaped.

The festival is celebrated in the month of April every year. The festival is used to usher into puberty or adulthood, girls who are virgins and it signifies that a lady, who partakes in it, is of age to be married. Parents upon hearing announcement of the rites send their qualified girls to the chief priest. However these girls would have to go through rituals and tests to prove their chastity before they qualify to partake in the festival. On the first day of the rites, the girls have their heads shaved and dressed with cloth around their waist to just their knee level. This is done by a special ritual mother and it signifies their transition from childhood to adulthood. They are paraded to the entire community as the initiates (dipo-yo). Early the next morning, the chief priest gives the initiates a ritual bath. He pours libation to ask for blessings for the girls. He then washes their feet with the blood of a goat which their parents presented. This is to drive away any spirit of barrenness. The crucial part of the rite is when the girls sit on the sacred stone. This is to prove their virginity. However, any girl found to be pregnant or not a virgin is detested by the community and does not entice a man from the tribe. The girls are then housed for a week, where they are given training on cooking, housekeeping, child birth and nurture. The ritual mothers give them special lessons on seduction and how their husbands will expect to be treated. They learn the Klama dance which will be performed on the final day of the rites. After the one-week schooling, they are finally released and the entire community gather to celebrate their transition into womanhood. They are beautifully dressed in rich kente cloth accessorised with beads around their waist, neck and arms. With singing and drumming, they perform the Klama dance. At this point, any man interested in any one of them can start investigating into her family. it is assumed that any lady who partakes in the rites not only brings honour to herself but to her family at large. It is done to initiate young women into knowing their responsibilities before stepping into marriage.

Its mission is \\"to provide assistance to the area‚Äôs at-risk youth and economically deprived citizens with special emphasis on total growth and development of the community.‚Äù The organization is a tax exempt, faith-based community center that provides programs and services to underprivileged youth, families, and individuals in Fredericksburg and its surrounding counties. History Bragg Hill Family Life Center was established in September 1997 by Dr. Joseph D. Henderson, Sr. and Dr. Doris S. Henderson, former residents of Bragg Hill, one of the area‚Äôs low income neighborhoods. Their goal to become a ‚ÄúPermanent Positive Presence‚Äù in the community began as an outreach ministry of their church, Tower of Deliverance. Originally located in a small storefront, BHFLC expanded in August 2003 by purchasing a former juvenile detention center. In 2006 BHFLC expanded again with the addition of a new 20,000 square foot gymnasium and fitness facility, the Sunshine Fitness and Wellness Center. Programs and Services BHFLC offers homework help, fitness and wellness programs, job readiness assistance, emergency food and clothing, computer access and training, senior craft classes, a prayer group, and other ministries. The center hosts annual holiday and educational events including community dinners, Santa Day, Lights On Afterschool, and festivities for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Bragg Hill Family Life Center emphasizes youth programs. It provides weekday afterschool activities, fitness and craft activities, and a summer camp to provide children with the opportunity to participate in sports, art, and other supervised activities. Within the year, BHFLC plans to launch Star Youth Academy, a licensed preschool geared towards children in the surrounding communities. BHFLC also functions as a community hub. It encourages other organizations to use its facilities to host events and meetings, ranging from faith-based retreats to public school Math & Science Nights to weekly parental support groups administered by RACCAP. Sunshine Fitness and Wellness Center In 2006 BHFLC expanded by adding a $2 million 20,000 square foot gymnasium and fitness facility, the Sunshine Fitness and Wellness Center. The facility was constructed based on donations from local philanthropist, Doris Buffet‚Äôs Sunshine Lady Foundation in conjunction with area churches, businesses, and community organizations. Impact In the course of its existence, Bragg Hill Family Life Center has developed into a multipurpose community center, and it has served thousands of people in the community. In a 2008 editorial, The Free Lance-Star commends, ‚ÄúThe story of Bragg Hill Family Life Center is not just about buildings and programs, it‚Äôs about changed lives. It‚Äôs about casting a positive vision, and sowing hope where there is none. It‚Äôs about believing that giving people a hand up can make a difference, that strengthening families should be a community goal, and that health and wellness are not impossible dreams. Most of all, it‚Äôs about building bonds in a community in an age when that kind of closeness is clearly endangered.‚Äù While expressing his desire to reform the United States‚Äô criminal justice system, U.S. Sen. Jim Webb (VA-D) praised BHFLC for its focus on aiding families and its work in helping incarcerated individuals transition back into regular life.

After Alexander the Great had destroyed Thebes in 335 BC he had given the Theban lands to the Boeotians, but without Macedon as hegemon in central Greece the Boeotians feared the Athenians would revive Theban power as a counterweight to the Macedonians and so the Boeotians would lose the lands they gained. When Athens sent reinforcements to the army led by Athenian general, Leosthenes, the Boeotians mobilized to resist the Athenians. The Athenians' reinforcements consisted of five thousand men and five hundred horses, as well as two thousand mercenaries, while Leosthenes moved with part of his forces to meet with them. After joining with the Athenian reinforcements, Leosthenes formed his men in line and attacked the Boeotian camp, defeating the enemy.

It was previously known as the National Bank of Algae (BNA). Introduction In addition to the functions of isolation, identification, characterization, conservation and provisioning, standard in any collection of microorganisms, the CBM-BEA/ULPGC aims to function as a service facilitating the development of a new bioindustrial sector based on the cultivation and application of microalgae. BEA has been member of the European Culture Collection Organization (ECCO) since 2001 and of the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) since 2003. BEA is listed in the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WFCC-MIRCEN) under registration number 837. BEA is Accredited as an International Authority for the Deposit of Micro-organisms in accordance with the Treaty of Budapest by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), resolution No. 239 of 28.10.2005 before the Government of Spain. This accreditation confers on BEA the deposit of algae for the purposes of recognition of industrial property before the World Intellectual Property Office and the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office. BEA holds strains from tropical and subtropical areas, in particular of the Macaronesian Region. These cultures have strain numbers preceded by BEA. Non-axenic cultures are marked with \\"B\\" at the end of the strain number. History 1985.- The embryo of the Group of Applied Algology, from the former Polytechnic University of the Canaries, started up with the motto \\"sun and seawater can grow more than tourists.\\" 1995.- The Center of Applied Algology -ULPGC (now the CBM-ULPGC) created a collection of microalgae in 1995 thanks to a generous donation from Dr. Ziiadine Ramazanov (scientist in the former USSR at the Soviet Academy of Science‚Äôs Institute of Plant Physiology and Astrobiology, who worked in the IAA in 1995-96), who gave his personal collection of microalgae to the IAA, thus helping to introduce the group to the field of biotechnology of microalgae. Before that date, the applied phycology group had only worked with macroalgae in the fields of in vitro cultures, population genetics and intensive cultures. 1996.- The CBM-BNA lost most of its microalga collection due to a 5-month electrical outage. Dr. Ramazanov emigrated to the United States, published several books and created a plant biotechnology company. 1998.- The paperwork was started to obtain WIPO accreditation for the BEA as an International Depositary Authority pursuant to the Budapest Treaty. The OEPM (Spanish Patent and Trademark Office) and the Spanish Type Culture Collection (University of Valencia) cooperated with this institution to achieve international accreditation for the BEA, a process that lasted until 2005. 1999.- Letter of support from the Council for Scientific Research (Dr. Miguel Garc√≠a Guerrero, CSIC-MEC) to consolidate the BNA (after an inspection visit to the facilities of what was then called the Centro de Algolog√≠a Aplicada (Applied Phycology Center) ‚Äì ULPGC). Letter of support was sent from the Spanish Phycology Society to consolidate the BNA (after an inspection visit to the facilities of what was then called the Centro de Algolog√≠a Aplicada (Applied Phycology Center) ‚Äì ULPGC). The Board of the ULPGC signed an agreement to break up the CBM-BNA. Following arduous litigation, which ended in 2003 with the final ruling from Spain‚Äôs Constitutional Court, the CBM-BNA was left intact. 2000.- The BNA was accepted as a member of the ECCO (European Culture Collection Organization). 2001.- Spain‚Äôs Parliament (Draft Law 161/000706 of 30 April 2001-Series D, No. 170) urged the government to establish the National Bank of Algae at the ULPGC‚Äôs Applied Phycology Center and to accredit it as an International Depositary Authority pursuant to the Budapest Treaty. 2003.- The BNA became a member of the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) and received registration number 837 in the WFCC- MIRCEN World Data Center for Microorganisms. The ULPGC endorsed CBM‚Äôs bylaws, which defined the BNA as one of the two Services (the other being Flow Cytometry) offered by the Centro de Biotecnolog√≠a Marina (Marine Biotechnology Center) ‚Äì ULPGC. CBM and BEA are finally recognized by the ULPGC. 2004.- Spain‚Äôs Ministry of Education and Science (MEC) awards the first and only financial grant conceded to the BEA prior to 2010 (every other local, regional and national grant request was rejected) through its 2003-2006 Complementary Actions aid program. The BNA collaborates in the first study of oceanic toxic algal blooms in the Canary Islands (summer 2004), commissioned by the Government of the Canaries Council on Agriculture, Fishing and Food. Resulting from this effort was the paper \\"Novel Bloom of Trichodesmium erythraeum in the NW African Upwelling\\".Ramos et al. 2005, p.303-305 The year before the CBM-BNA had warned of the risk of toxic microalgal Aphanizomenon spp blooms in reservoirs on the island of Grand Canary. When the bloom of toxic cyanobacteria became evident three months later, the drainage basin had to be closed off and irrigation suspended. There are certified reports of hospitalizations in the Canaries due to the consumption of fish containing microalgal toxins. The risks of HAB (Harmful Algal Blooms) and their increased incidence due to climate change started to be taken seriously by government officials. 2005.- BNA was accredited as an International Depositary Authority for the purposes of patent procedure. The complex process to accredit the BNA/CBM as an International Depositary Authority (for patent purposes) pursuant to the Budapest Treaty successfully culminated on 28 October 2005 with the publication of its accreditation in the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) Official Bulletin (Budapest Notification No. 239). BNA organized the Tropical and Subtropical Cyanoprokaryota Workshop 2005 (TSCW2005), in cooperation with Proexca, the Industry Council of Grand Canary, Caja Rural de Canarias Foundation, La Caixa, the ULPGC Board, the Ocean Sciences Department of the ULPGC and the spin-off company Seaweed Canarias. 2007.- The MEC provided funds for staffing one Scientific-Technological Infrastructure Specialist at the National Bank of Algae (BNA). 2009.- The Minister of Science and Innovation, Dr. Cristina Garmendia, announced the consolidation of the BNA-CBM. ‚ÄúThe BNA will serve as a national research service to promote microalgae-based bio-industries, it will create and maintain its own collection, taking advantage of Spanish oceanographic expeditions, and it will provide samples to laboratories and companies that so request them for study and eventual technical applications‚Äù. In late 2009, the Government of Spain (Ministry of Innovation and Science [MICINN]) finalized a 2.6 M‚Ç¨ grant for the consolidation of the BNA (23 July 2009), as part of the PLAN-E microalgae project. CBM is included in the Canaries Marine Development Complex, located in Taliarte (SE coast of Grand Canary), and the emerging BNA backs the joint request made to the MICINN by the ULPGC and the University of La Laguna (ULL) to classify the Tricontinental Campus as a ‚Äúcampus of excellence‚Äù. 2010.- In March 2010, contracts were finalized and remodeling work had begun on the CBM-BNA laboratories as part of a Plan-E Project, which was initially scheduled for completion in December 2010, though the deadline was later extended until December 2011. The remodeling work (the deadline extension was not implemented) was completed on 16 December (the scientific work of the CBM-BNA did not stop in 2010, since every available inch of the laboratories on the ground floor and the second floor hallways were turned into offices, classrooms and bathrooms ). Doctors Michael Melkonian and Barbara Melkonian (University of Cologne, Germany) made a sabbatical stay (September 2010 to March 2011) at BNA. 2011.- By February growth chambers, equipments and basic microalgae cultivation systems were operating. In May the organization was officially renamed to Spanish Bank of Algae (BEA). On June 2, the authorisation to publish the BEA website was granted, which includes catalogs of products and services. Products *Strains: Main Catalog, Axenic Strains, gDNA Strains, and Sequenced DNA Strains. *Genomic DNA: BEA offers aliquots of genomic DNA from most of its strains. Genomic DNA is extracted and purified in the Molecular Biology Unit of the Marine Biotechnology Center, ULPGC, using commercially available kits.

The company grew to become an important provider of insurance nationwide, before ceasing operations some time after the 1970s. History The United States Fire Insurance Company of New York commenced business on April 9, 1824, with a capital stock of $250,000. The Principal Office for the company was located at 46 Pine Street in New York City. Joshua Sutton Underhill served as President of the company from 1849 until his death in 1858 at the age of 55. Elected to replace him was his younger brother, Abraham Sutton Underhill, who served as President for a further 25 years. At the time of Joshua's death and Abraham's election, their nephew, W. Wilson Underhill began working as a clerk in insurance commissions. In 1862 he was appointed to the position of Assistant Secretary at the company, becoming Secretary in 1865. He was elected President of the company in 1882 following Abraham's death the previous December, a position he held for 26 years until his retirement in 1908. A war among insurance companies around 1898, caused a committee of 15 New York-based insurance companies to be formed, and to organize a tariff association. E.C. Irvin of the Fire Association of Philadelphia said at the time, \\"Rates at first were made so high as to invite and foster unfair and illegitimate competition, loose practices, private deals, broken agreements, and at last utter demoralization. A meeting in September 1898 called for an association to rate and govern the fire insurance businesses in New York City. William Wilson Underhill was involved in discussions leading to formation of the tariff association, given his role as President of the United States Fire Insurance Company. Underhill was subsequently elected as Secretary for the Fire Insurance Tariff Committee. Citing the withdrawal of small companies and a large loss ration for the last two months in 1898, that the work of the committee would be favorably received. The company had net assets of $626,049.95 on December 31, 1901, with total income of $657,078.71 and total disbursements of $542,952.28. The new century brought with it expansion into new areas across the country. Southwestern General Managers were appointed representatives for the United State Fire Insurance Company of New York for a new venture in Houston, Texas. At times other companies reinsured the outstanding insurance of the United States Fire Insurance Company of New York. Such was the case in 1903, when the National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford reinsured all the risks of the United States Fire Insurance Company of New York in Iowa. In 1904, H.G. Fairfield & Co. were appointed Boston agents of the United States Fire Insurance Company of New York, to succeed Prescott Chamberlain. A troubling sign emerged around 1906, when the United States Fire Insurance Company of New York decided to stop underwriting. An article in The New York Times stated \\"This stoppage is understood to be only temporary, and until the capital of the company has been reinforced.\\" Their assets at the time had risen to $814,180 and its net surplus was $60,330. As late at 1977 the United States Fire Insurance Company of New York was still in operation.

He also played for the Edmonton Eskimos and Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Alston played college football for the East Carolina Pirates as a quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. While at East Carolina University, Alston studied economics. After failing to make the Browns' regular season roster in 2003, he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe, where he became a World Bowl champion. Alston played as a kick returner for the Browns in 2004 before playing in the CFL from 2006 to 2007.  College career  Alston played high school football at Warren County High School as a quarterback. He later attended college at East Carolina University, where he played for the Pirates from 1999 to 2002. As a freshman, Alston was used by the Pirates coaching staff in tandem with sophomore teammate David Garrard as a quarterback. As Garrard's usage increased going into his junior and senior years, the Pirates coaching staff tried out Alston at several different positions. After starting the 2001 season as a running back, Alston was converted mid-season to a wide receiver, the position in which he would play out the rest of his college and professional careers. In his final year with the Pirates, Alston led the team with 702 receiving yards on 36 catches, adding six touchdowns.  Professional career  Alston went undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft. He was signed by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in May 2003. Alston did not make the Browns' regular season roster, but he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe. While with the Thunder in 2004, Alston threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Chas Gessner in World Bowl XII. The trick play, which had Alston line up as a receiver before throwing the ball, helped the Thunder defeat the Frankfurt Galaxy 30‚Äì24 to become World Bowl champions. In 2004, Alston returned to the Browns. While he was not valuable to the Browns at wide receiver, the team used him as a return specialist. In a November game against the Baltimore Ravens, Alston scored his first NFL touchdown after returning the opening kickoff 93 yards. He played in nine regular season games in 2004 returning kickoffs. Alston returned to the Browns' training camp in 2005, where he competed with Andr√© Davis and Josh Cribbs to remain a kick returner. The Browns released Alston in their final round of cuts. The Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL signed Alston in 2006. In training camp, he competed with several other import receivers for a roster spot, including former Denver Broncos player Chris Cole. The coaching staff also evaluated him along with Tony Tompkins and Toby Zeigler to return kicks. Alston solidified his spot on the roster by leading the team in preseason catches. Alston remained on the roster into the regular season. After Eskimos wide receiver Trevor Gaylor dropped a pass near the Eskimos sideline during Week 1, the Eskimos coaching staff removed Gaylor from the starting lineup. Alston started his first game in the CFL the following week against the Calgary Stampeders. He suffered an ankle injury during his first start, but he quickly recovered to catch three passes for 76 yards two weeks later against the BC Lions. In August, Gaylor reclaimed his starting position from Alston after Alston dropped a long pass in a game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Alston finished the regular season with seven games played, recording 23 catches for 261 yards and a single two-point conversion. Although the Eskimos had considered him as a potential kick returner in training camp, he returned only one kickoff along with three punts. In February 2007, the Eskimos traded Alston to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The deal also sent Nicolas Bisaillon, Timmy Chang, and a draft pick to the Tiger-Cats in exchange for defensive back Jason Goss. The Tiger-Cats receiver corps were considered a weakness going into the 2007 season, and the team tried out at least fourteen receivers in training camp. In mid-June, The Hamilton Spectator reported that Alston was showing potential in training camp and had a \\"leg up\\" to make the team. Alston made the active roster for the regular season and played in one game for the Tiger- Cats, but he was released in early July. He briefly signed with the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League in November 2007, but the Gladiators released Alston in February 2008 before the start of the regular season.

But receiving news of the progress of the war and realizing that he could not wait for his reinforcements to arrive, he marched south to Thessaly with 13,000 foot soldiers and 600 horsemen, while he left Sippas in command of Macedon. But the Thessalians, who initially supported Macedon, changed sides to the Athenian alliance and joined the Athenian general Leosthenes' forces in occupying the passes of Thermopylae, significantly outnumbering the Macedonians. Antipater was defeated in the ensuing battle and since he could not retreat because the Athenian coalitions' forces were stronger than his forces, he shut himself in the city of Lamia where he was subsequently besieged by Leosthenes' forces.

Evans grew up in South Bend, Indiana and attended James Whitcomb Riley High School. He went to the University of Notre Dame and played halfback and fullback on the school's football team starting in 1940. After graduating from college, Evans joined the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, where he stayed until his discharge in 1945. He then signed with the Browns, a team in the new AAFC, where he played for one year. He subsequently played for the Buffalo Bills, the Chicago Bears and the Chicago Rockets in 1947 and 1948. Evans moved to Cleveland after his playing career and owned a dry cleaning business. He died in 2007. Early life and high school Evans was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and moved to Detroit before his family settled in South Bend, Indiana. Evans attended James Whitcomb Riley High School in South Bend, where he played football, baseball, basketball and track. He was named an all-state halfback in his senior year. College and military career Evans attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played at left halfback for the school's football team starting as a sophomore in 1940. He moved to fullback the following year, when Notre Dame went undefeated under coach Frank Leahy. Evans led the team in rushing yards and scoring in 1941. Evans was considered shy but tough. Before a game against the University of Southern California (USC) in 1941, Bill Riordan, a teammate, poured a bucket of water over Evans's head. Evans tried to retaliate but crashed into a wall and split his knee open. He concealed the injury from Leahy and played in the USC game, but needed 11 stitches afterward. After graduating in 1942, Evans was drafted by the Chicago Bears of the National Football League. His professional football career, however, was delayed by service in World War II. Evans signed up for the United States Army Air Corps and flew P-51 Mustangs with the Flying Tigers, a unit that defended China against Japanese incursion during the war. While in the air corps, Evans played for the Randolph Field Ramblers, a military team at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Randolph won the national service title in 1944, when Evans was on the team. Professional career In 1945, Evans became the fourth player signed by the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference, which was to start play in 1946. Evans was the first player to score points for the Browns in their inaugural exhibition game on August 30 against the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Akron Rubber Bowl. He scored a touchdown on a seven-yard pass from quarterback Cliff Lewis; he later intercepted a pass and returned it 83 yards for another touchdown. Later in the season, Evans twisted his knee and was sidelined for more than a month. The Browns went on to win the first AAFC championship in 1946. Before the beginning of the 1947 season, Evans was sent to the Buffalo Bills in a special draft designed to help the AAFC's weaker teams. He played for the Chicago Rockets and Chicago Bears in 1947 and 1948. Later life and death Evans came back to Cleveland after his football career and owned a dry cleaning business, with his wife Dorothy Evans, called Handee Cleaners in the city's West Park area.

December 2010; 7: 87‚Äì102. It is a pre-harvest festival celebrated in the months of March and April, with sacrifices offered to seek protection and ensure plentiful rain and a good harvest in the coming season from the earthly gods. The festival has a three-day programme at three different villages. The first part takes place at Gorogo, the second at Yinduri, and the final and biggest at Teng-Zug (Tong-Zuf). Libation is poured at the Teng-Zug shrine to thank the gods for a successful occasion. The one in March is called Gol-diema, which means tutorial. The main Gologo festival is celebrated in the second week in April. Traditional songs are composed by the elders of each community for the occasion and people dance to the composed songs. During this period, noise-making is prohibited and no one mourns their dead. The Gologo festival which is also known as the Golib festival is celebrated in the month of March at the end of the dry season before the sewing of the early millet (Ansah, 1997; Allman & Parker, 2005). Tengzug, Santeng, Wakii, Gbeogo, Yinduri/Zandoya, Shia, Gorogo and Spart are the communities which celebrate the festival. There is a special dress code whereby men wear a short knicker and a towel on the chest. Women are also expected to tie a long towel from their chest down to the feet and cover their heads with a special local-made cloth. Costumes used in Gologo Festival The Talensi people of Tenzug in the Upper East Region celebrates on of the rarest festivals in the country of Ghana. It is probably the only festival where participants observe a strict compliance to the wearing of certain kind of costume. Due to the nature of this custom, researchers sort to find out the art form which make up the costume and their religious or functional significance. The study used participant observation and interviews to document the festivities before, during and after the festival. The prominent features of the costume includes towels of different sizes and colours, knives of different sizes and the wearing of triangularly shaped aprons. The study concludes that there is the need to advertise the festival in the entire country of Ghana as well as abroad in order to open up the Tengzug area to more tourists and investors. Preparation of the festival In the month of February which precedes the festival celebration, new songs are learnt by the communities for the celebration also new costumes and accessories are procured or prepared. The date for the celebration depends on the appearance of the third moon in each year. And this could appear in March or early April. In 2016, the new moon surfaced on 9 March. On the first day when the moon appears, the Chief and the Tindaana's remove their clothes (especially shirts and trousers, and put on traditional regalia meant for the celebration). The people in the community also remove theirs a day after the chief and the Tindaana have done so. For community members, the removal involves all clothing covering the upper part of the body, removing all trousers and wearing only boxer shorts, pants or shorts which have no pockets on them, or wearing kpalang or kpalang peto. This removal is for a period of one month. During this period, no noise is to be made in the community. As such crying for the dead, roofing of houses, loud music playing among other activities are prohibited during this period. The communities then begin series of mini festival rites in the towns that surround the Tongo Hills which include dancing and merry making. On the 16th day after the removal of dresses (in 2016, the day was on 24 March), all the communities will congregate at Tengzug for the final festival celebrations. Relevance of the festival It is celebrated to ensure ‚Äúsuccess in all food getting enterprises, security from danger, disease and death‚Äù (Insoll, et al., 2013). In the celebration prayers are said to the Golib god led by the Nnoo shrine. According to Joffroy (2005), the festival is to reinforce the belief of the people of the community in the shrine.

In 1992 she founded the Aidan Gallery in Moscow. Salakhova's works can be found in many private and state collections including the State Tretyakov Gallery, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, the Ekaterina Cultural Foundation, Francois Pinault Foundation, Teutloff Museum and the Boghossian Foundation; in private collections of I. Khalilov, P-K. Broshe, T. Novikov, V. Nekrasov, V. Bondarenko and others. At the 2011 Venice Biennale, Salakhova's name hit the headlines when her work was politically censored. Biography Aidan Salahova was born in 1964 in Moscow in the family of Azeri and Russian artist Tahir Salahov, who is the Vice-president of the Russian Academy of Arts, and a laureate of state awards in Russia and Azerbaijan. In 1987 she graduated from the Moscow State Surikov Institute of Fine Arts (Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture) as an external student. Since 2000, Aidan Salakhova is professor at the institute. Since 2007, she is an Academician of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts. In the late 1980s Salakhova became one of the most significant art figures of the new generation in post-Soviet countries In 2002 Aidan was awarded a silver medal by the Russian Academy of Fine Arts. In 2005-2007 she was a member of the Public Chamber. Having worked for over twenty years as both an artist and a gallerist she has been one of the strongest influences on the development of contemporary art in post- Soviet Russia. Salakhova has exhibited her work at major international art fairs and biennales, including twice at the Venice Biennale (1991 and 2011) and at the Second Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art (2007). Artworks Salahova's art won recognition not only in the Russian art community, but also internationally. Aidan is a regular participant of major international art fairs and biennales including the Venice Biennale of Contemporary Art (1991, 2011), the 2nd Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art (2007), etc. In her works, Salakhova investigates gender themes, women's sexuality in the context of Islam, contrasts between the East and the West, matters of prohibition, esotericism, and beauty. She is one of the key artists on a contemporary Russian art scene working in various mediums, such as photography, sculpture, painting, and installations. Aidan Salakhova marries Eastern Islamic with Western feminist influences, combining her Azerbaijani background with her Eastern European upbringing. Her ‚ÄúPersian Miniatures‚Äù series explores the feminine identity in an Islamic context. Missing elements carry as much weight as those that are visualized. Feminine figures are delicately portrayed, with the male presence noticeably absent. The drawings are flat and their subjects anonymous, rendering them interchangeable and representational. Her execution traces back to Persian miniatures from which the series takes its name. Her selection of this style is fitting, as Persian miniatures historically were private books, allowing artists to express themselves more freely than they would with more public wall art. Although these are typically executed in vibrant, vivid colors, Salakhova's miniatures are more somber, as though carrying the strength and the weight of their subjects. Highly semiotic, Salakhova's work plays on the capability of representative imagery to represent a multitude of meanings, primary among which is women's position within established social conventions. Her symbols are far from mundane, featuring images such as the gourd, a womb- like symbol of fertility. Also recurring is the minaret symbol, representing faith and power, as well as unity given its function as the location of the call to prayer. Water, a symbol of purity and life across a number of civilizations and religions is also an expression of tears as the inner emotional sea.

The festival is celebrated on the first Saturday in the month of September every year. The Fetu Afahye is celebrated annually by the Oguaa people of Cape Coast because in the past there was an outbreak of disease among the people that killed many. The people prayed to the gods to help them to get rid of the disease. Thus the festival is celebrated to keep the town clean and to prevent another epidemic befalling the people. History Fetu Afahye is an annual festival celebrated by the people and chiefs of Cape Coast Traditional Area in the Central Region of Ghana. Once upon a time there had been a plague in Cape Coast as history has it. This was devastating and as such demanded that the people of Cape Coast call for an intervention from their gods. However, it is believed that the inhabitants of Cape Coast and its environs were able to eliminate this plague with the help of their gods, hence, the name \\"Fetu\\" ‚Äì originally Efin Tu (\\"doing away with dirt\\"). It is also observed to commemorate a bumper harvest from the sea as well as performing rituals to thank the 77 gods of Oguaa Traditional Area.\\"Oguaa Fetu Afahye Festival, Cape Coast\\" at Afro Tourism. The Fetu Afahye was once banned by the then colonial administration of the country, and specifically Cape Coast, and was termed \\"Black Christmas\\" to depict it as a bad traditional phenomenon. The Omanhen (paramount chief) at that time, who is named as the Osabarimba Kodwo Mbra V, Okyeame Ekow Atta, debunked this conception as misleading. Between 1948 and 1996, the festival finally resumed, after the religious struggle from various important personalities in the Oguaa Traditional Area. The festival is now used as a calendar for the farming seasons of the Oguaa Traditional Area and this particular phenomenon is also referred to as \\"Afehyia\\", meaning \\"a loop of seasons\\". Celebrating the Fetu Afahye festival Preparation for the festival starts in the last week of August. During this period, Oguaa Traditional area receives many visitors from all walks of life, as well as people from different parts of the country or outside the country who are natives of Oguaa state. The actual celebration follows on the first Saturday of September. Prior to the actual celebration of the festival, the Omanhen is confined for a week. During this period of confinement, he meditates and asks for wisdom from the creator (Aboadzi) and the ancestors, as well as seeking medical attention where necessary from his physician to enable him come out both physically and mentally fit for the impending activities such as delivering his tasks for the success of the festival. At the end of Omahen‚Äôs confinement, he appears in public in pomp and dignity and goes to the stool house to pour libation, seeking blessing from the 77 gods of Oguaa state who the people believe steer the affairs of Oguaa traditional area. It is also noted that before the festival, all drumming festivities and drumming sounds are banned as tradition demands, as well as fishing in the Fosu Lagoon, lying between The Government Central Hospital and stretching to a place called Aquarium, to ensure a quiet and peaceful environment. It is believed that this done to allow the spirits of Oguaa state to take over and lead the planners of the festival. This is usually observed before 1 September. The custodians of Fosu Lagoon (Amissafo) of Oguaa Traditional Area also pour libation at the estuary of the lagoon and invoke the spirits of their ancestors to eradicate any bad omens that may befall visitors involved in the festival. The aim of pouring libation is also to call for a plumper harvest of fish and crops. In all, they call for prosperity. Another important event observed is the \\"Amuntumadeze\\" ‚Äì literal meaning \\"health day\\" ‚Äì a day when both old and the young make efforts to clean the environment, including clearing waste from choked gutters and painting all buildings in the area, with the aim of beautifying the vicinity before the actual grand durbar of \\"Bakatue\\". A vigil is observed at Fosu Lagoon near its shrine on every last Monday of August. A large number of people gather at the shrine to have a glimpse of the display of the priests and priestesses of the traditional area. This exhibition is normally done in the night till the next morning. During this night, drumming and dancing by both the priest and the priestesses are observed and the spirits of their ancestors are invoked to foretell what will happen in the next year. The following Tuesday also sees many activities, such as rituals carried out at the Fosu shrine, and finally daytime regatta and canoe riding on the Fosu Lagoon is observed after the Omanhen's libation at the estuary. As a result of the earlier ban on fishing in the Fosu Lagoon, the Omanhen is the first person to throw his net, three consecutive times. to officially open up the lagoon for the general public. For the Omanhen to catch plenty of fish indicates a prosperous fishing season to come. This event is foreshown by special crowd in the middle of the firing of musketry. This is called \\"Bakatue\\". However, in giving a warm welcoming atmosphere for the native who have travelled, the chiefs of Oguaa Traditional Area set aside Wednesday for receiving and welcoming citizens of Cape Coast. This day is also characterized by drumming and dancing by the Asafo companies, the seven traditional militia groups.Shirley Asiedu-Addo and Deborah Oluwamuyiwa, \\"Oguaa celebrates Fetu Afahye\\", Graphic Online, 4 September 2017. It is also noted as a day of socialization and resolution of issues. A religious ceremony is held in front of Nana Paprata shrine on the Thursday night, with accompanying rituals and dancing (\\"Adammba\\") to summon the spirits of the ancestors to enable the priests and priestesses to soothsay. This ceremony normally lasts till the next morning. The main aim of this ceremony is to cleanse Oguaa Traditional Area of any bad spirit. During this same period, a bull is always needed to purify the Oguaa Traditional Area. Prior to this purification, the bull is sent to Nana Tabir‚Äôs shrine to cleanse the bull for sacrifice on the ultimate day. This bull is then later sacrificed at Papratam (the durbar grounds for Ogua Traditional Area). It is mostly identify as the silk cotton tree where the Omanhen, on the climax day, sits in state with his divisional and sub- chiefs, flanked by the council of elders. At the meeting, the Omanhen addresses the people and visitors of Oguaa Traditional Area, recounting events of the past. After the state address, the Omanhen walks towards the entrance, flanked by his sub-chiefs and divisional chiefs to Tabir's shrine, where the cow is tied by its limbs. The Omanhen pours libation and performs various rituals, calling on the forefathers to intervene in Oguaa state. At this juncture, he takes a dagger to slaughter the cow for the gods. After the Omanhen's sacrifice, the Fetu festival reaches its climax on the first Saturday of September. This particular day attracts a unique and attentive audience for the procession of the Asafo bands, which usually parade along the street of Cape Coast from Kotokuraba through Chapel Square to the chief palace. People from all parts of the country visit Cape Coast to observe this festival. A durbar of chiefs is held on this day to deliberate on issues affecting Oguaa Traditional Area as well as the seven Asafo companies to contribute to the security of Oguaa Traditional Area. This day is marked by drumming, dancing and pouring of libation to usher the state in a peaceful and prosperous new year. Contemporary issues, such as the Afahye state dance, local cuisine, football games, clothing and traditional wear, among many other forms of cultural artifacts, add up to giving facial lift to the endowments of the festivals, particularly the stylish and eye-catching dance of the Miss Afahye. After the festive days are over, the grand ceremony is on Sunday, when a joint service of all Christian denominations is held at Chapel Square to offer thanks to Almighty God for helping Oguaa Traditional Area to have a peaceful festival. In addition the day is an occasion is to appeal for funds for Oguaa Traditional Area. In view of this, the Omanhen and his divisional chiefs as well as elders attend the church occasion and take the opportunity to announce the day for next year's celebration.

It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It was deemed \\"an excellent example of the architecture of Bruce Goff during the time he was Director of the School of Architecture at the University of Oklahoma.\\" With .  Structure  The teepee-shaped design was intended to be imaginative on a frugal budget, using surplus pipe and corrugated aluminum from oil fields, volunteer labor to weld the pipes and build the church, and local supplies like rock from quarries in nearby Calumet, Oklahoma. The peak, which is about 80 feet high, is an open metal bellfry containing no bell and 12 triangular windows that always leaked when it rained. The shingles were originally the color of the red soil that is characteristic to the area, but were eventually replaced by gray shingles. The base was finished with native rock and sheet metal. The nave of the church was arranged in the round. The lower level held classrooms. The exterior support structure features 12 exposed tapered trusses made of welded steel drill-stem pipes and painted russet color and secured by a compression ring. The 12 supports were nicknamed after the Twelve Apostles.  Construction  The building was constructed by members of the church, who worked on evenings and weekends from 1947 to 1951 to build it. Construction used 1,000 tons of steel pipes. The building cost $20,000, and Goff reduced his fee for the design and for supervising the construction to $1,200.  Use  The building was used as a church until it closed in 1989, due to water leaks, and due to the high cost of heating and cooling a building with no insulation. The church owning the property was first known as Hopewell Baptist Church. After that, it was the Church at Edmond. Later, a non-denominational church, meeting in a separate building, was called God's TP Tabernacle or God's Tabernacle of Praise.  Restoration  Asbestos was removed in 1999. The Hopewell Heritage Foundation was formed in 2005 to raise $1.25 million to restore the church, plus money to pay for maintenance. The restoration effort is being led by Elliott and Associates Architects of Oklahoma. The roof was replaced in late 2013 by Jenco Roofing Company to prevent further decay. , the roof, windows, and doors had been fixed, but structural work was needed on the inside, to support the upstairs floor.

The festival is celebrated annually on the first Saturday in the month of November. The name of the festival is derived from the Ewe language and translates as, the festival of exodus. or \\"coming from Hogbe (Notsie)\\". The celebration of the festival was instituted about four decades ago. History The Anlo are a group of people from a tribe in the eastern coast of Ghana. Prior to their settling in their present location, they lived in Notsie, a town in present-day Togo. It is believed that they had migrated from southern Sudan to settle in Notsie. Oral tradition has it that they lived under a wicked king, Togbe Agorkoli, and in order to escape his tyrannical rule they had to create a hole in the mud wall that surrounded their town. They achieved this by instructing the women to pour all their waste water on one particular place in the wall. Over time the spot became soft, thereby allowing the townspeople to break through the wall and escape. Tradition also holds that, to avoid pursuit and make good their escape, they walked backwards with their faces towards the town so that their footprints appeared to be going into the town. The celebration Various ceremonies are held during the festival. They include a peace-making period in which all disputes are ended with the finding of amicable solution. It is believed that the reason for this traditional period of peace making is that the people believe their ancestors lived in harmony with themselves all through their escape from Notsie and that it was this character that made their sojourn a success. There is also a purification ceremony of the ceremonial stools (where the Ewe believe the ancestral spirits reside) through the pouring of libations. This is followed by general cleaning where all the villages are swept and rubbish burnt. This cleaning ceremony starts at the Volta Estuary and ends after several days at the Mono River in the Republic of Benin. The climax of the festival involves a durbar of the chiefs and peoples of Anlo. The chiefs dress in colourful regalia and receive homage from their subjects at the durbar grounds. Various forms of dancing, singing and merry-making characterize the entire festival.  The Agbadza The Agbadza is the traditional dance of the people of Anlo which is performed vigorously during the grand durbar of the Hogbetsotso festival. It is a way of expressing joy to their ancestors and gods. Agbadza can be performed anywhere, at parties, funerals and at naming ceremonies. In this modern age anyone from any tribe can perform the agbadza dance regardless.Agbadza is a very great dance indeed.  Today  The 2019 Hogbetsotso festival was attended by some dignitaries including two Ghanaian Ex Presidents, Jerry John Rawlings, and John Dramani Mahama.

Building design This building is a two-story structure dug into a hillside facing west across Riverside Drive toward the Arkansas River. Located on an tract, it has a flat roof and stucco exterior. The NRHP application says that the two-story entrance hall is, \\"... the most prominent feature of the building.\\" Two sets of external stairs lead to a common landing that accesses a foyer. The large, flat, circular window in the front of the foyer is considered a primary decorative feature of the building. Other front windows are stepped and have alternating inserts of black glass to provide a diagonal pattern. Behind the foyer is an auditorium (recital hall), in which the audience would face eastward toward the stage, in the next wing of the building. The one-story auditorium has three sets of double doors on the north and south sides. The auditorium, as a connecting element between the entrance hall and living quarters, is relatively narrow and this geometric configuration defines partially enclosed patio areas on both north and south elevations of the building. The wing east of the auditorium houses the recital stage. A small service area and kitchen is at the north end of the stage, while a living room, garage, and servant quarters are at the south end. This end of the wing is two stories high, with a small part extending to three stories. Subsequent alterations The original living room walls were paneled with wood imported from Japan, the ceiling was decorated with aluminum leaf and the room had a fireplace decorated with green marble and black glass. As mentioned above, there were four murals in the recital hall that had been painted by Olinka Hrdy. These features were no longer present at the time the NRHP application was submitted. The Iannelli-designed fountain had been dismantled. Side doors of the recital hall had been blocked by air- conditioning ducts that had been installed during a later period. The NRHP review committee determined that these changes did not negate the assignment of Category C.

It was a siege of the city of Bactra by the Seleucid Empire after they defeated the Greco-Bactrians at the Battle of the Arius. The Seleucids besieged the capital of Bactria until concerning news from the west of his dominions and lack of progress against the city led the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III to negotiate a peace treaty with the Bactrian king Euthydemus and lift the siege. It was agreed that Antiochus would recognize Euthydemus as an ally, and he gave one of his daughters as a wife to Demetrius, Euthydemus' eldest son. Siege and Peace The Greco-Bactrians had recently been defeated at the Battle of the Arius by Antiochus III. After this defeat, Euthydemus retreated to Zariaspa, a district of Bactra. The Greco-Bactrians were able to hold out long enough against Antiochus until his fortunes in the west deteriorated. After two years' laying siege to Bactra, Antiochus' fortunes to the west of his empire had deteriorated to the point where he decided to withdraw from the siege. Euthydemus then sent his son, Demetrius, as his representative to negotiate a peace treaty. Impressed at Demetrius' behaviour and bearing which was seen as worthy of that of a member of the royalty, Antiochus offered him one of his daughters and agreed to a peace treaty. As a part of the peace treaty, Euthydemus gave Antiochus elephants which Antiochus, along with his own, may have used at Magnesia.

Eyeem.com and the EyeEm mobile app is a place for photographers of any ability to share, interact and learn more about photography. The technology company uses artificial intelligence to find the best images to license to brands, agencies or individuals looking for authentic imagery. As of August 2016, the community consists of over 18 million photographers and more than 70M photos.  History  In early 2010, photo enthusiasts Florian Meissner, Ramzi Rizk, Gen Sadakane and Lorenz Aschoff came together to discuss mobile photography. By March, they decided to host one of the world's first mobile photography competitions and host an exhibition. The winners and runners-up were part of an exhibition that took place in Berlin on June 22 of the same year.\\"EYE'EM\\" by Mobile Photography, Lulu.com, first edition, October 26, 2010 During the beta period, EyeEm was an iPhone only app and was called EYE'EM, and managed to have more than 5,000 users from 79 countries.http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/8/prweb8693991.htm In early 2011, Meissner, Rizk, Sadakane, and Aschoff decided to work on the idea full-time and launched the first version of the EyeEm app on Android and iOS in August 2011 following the beta test period. In March 2014, EyeEm partnered with Getty Images to distribute photographs taken by EyeEm users. By June 2014, EyeEm had over 10 million users. In March 2015, EyeEm reached 13 million users and launched Market, its own online marketplace where users can sell their own images. A month later, in April 2015, the technology company raised $18M in Series B funding. The round was led by Valar Ventures and includes existing investors Earlybird Ventures, Passion Capital, Wellington Partners, Atlantic Labs and Open Ocean Capital. As part of the new round, Valar took a board seat at the company. In June 2015, EyeEm launched the Discover Feed, a manually curated feed, in an effort to showcase the ‚Äúmost beautiful images from featured photographers and albums.‚Äù In September 2015, EyeEm launched EyeEm Vision (previously called EyeVision), a deep learning computer vision framework that recognizes concepts and ranks aesthetics of images. In January 2016, EyeEm announced a new partnership with Alamy as another distribution partner besides Getty. In May 2016, EyeEm launched The Roll, an iOS app that analyzes the camera roll and uses computer vision to tag the images and rank the photos by how good they are. The app made headlines at Apple's worldwide developer conference (WWDC 2016), where it was announced that The Roll will be one of the first apps to deeply integrate with Siri, \\"by combining speech recognition with EyeEm‚Äôs aesthetic rank technology\\". In July 2016, EyeEm reaches 18M users and opens their Web Upload to all users so that it is as easy as possible for Flickr users to upload their pictures to EyeEm Market and join their photography based community. On February 16, 2019 EyeEm announced that they got hacked and its database was put for sale on the Dream Market. The database consists of roughly 22 million records and included email addresses and passwords. The passwords were stored encrypted (hashed and salted) with the SHA-1 algorithm.  Technology  EyeEm's image recognition technology uses artificial intelligence to tag and rank images based on an aesthetic score assigned to each photo. When users upload a photo via the Web Upload tool, this technology is applied to determine the discoverability of each photo, and suggest keywords. The company applied this to an iOS app called The Roll, which launched in May 2016 and organizes the images on your camera roll.  Funding  The company has raised $24 million to date in funding from Valar Ventures, Earlybird Venture Capital, Passion Capital, Wellington Partners, Atlantic Labs and OpenOcean. In 2018, it was revealed that the company raised an additional $10 million in an internal round from existing investors, with new investors Cipio Partners joining the round.http://www.cipiopartners.com/portfolio/https://www.gruenderszene.de/technologie/eyeem-10-millionen- dollar-geheim EyeEm was incorporated in Berlin, Germany,http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/eyeem-receives-seed-funding.html in February 2011 by founders Florian Meissner, Lorenz Aschoff, Gen Sadakane, and Ramzi Rizk.

A graduate from Tsinghua University, Chen served as the party chief of the prestigious institution from 2002 to 2008. Thereafter he served as a vice-minister of education and Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology.  Early career  Chen traces his ancestry to Putian, Fujian province, and was born in the provincial capital Fuzhou. He worked in his youth at a mechanics factory attached to Fuzhou University. Shortly after the resumption of higher education at the end of the Cultural Revolution, Chen was recommended to attend the prestigious Tsinghua University as a \\"Worker-Peasant-Soldier student\\", where he earned a bachelor's degree. At Tsinghua he was friends with Xi Jinping, who was also attending Tsinghua at the time. Chen joined the Communist Party in November 1978. After graduating from Tsinghua he returned to Fuzhou University to become a lecturer. In September 1979 he headed back to Tsinghua where he completed a Masters of Science degree. He stayed at Tsinghua to work for the Communist Party and its affiliated Youth League as a political organizer. Between 1990 and 1992 he went on a stint at Stanford University as a visiting scholar. Beginning in August 1993, he became the deputy chief of the party organization at Tsinghua, becoming executive deputy chief two years later. In 2002 he became head of the Tsinghua party organization. In November 2008, Chen became Vice Minister of Education, leaving his post at Tsinghua shortly thereafter. In September 2010, Chen was sent to Liaoning to serve as Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the province, where he served for a mere seven months. In April 2011 Chen became the head of the party branch and Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST), succeeding Deng Nan. Rise to prominence In April 2013, following the ascension of Xi Jinping to the posts of General Secretary and President, Chen left his post at CAST and was transferred to become executive deputy head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China.Áî≥Áª¥Ëæ∞‰ªª‰∏≠ÂõΩÁßëÂçèÂÖöÁªÑ‰π¶ËÆ∞ ÈôàÂ∏å‰∏çÂÜçÊãÖ‰ªª Chen is widely seen as a confidant and ally of Xi Jinping. At the 19th Party Congress, Chen was named head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China, placed in charge of party personnel. As was customary for an Organization Department head, he was given a seat on the 19th Politburo of the Communist Party of China. Unusually, however, Chen Xi broke nearly thirty years of party precedent by becoming the president of the Central Party School without holding a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee. While this was seen as a \\"demotion\\" of the status of the Central Party School, it was also seen as an elevation of Chen Xi's position. Chen is a member of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and was a member of the 16th and 17th Central Commissions for Discipline Inspection. Beginning in 2013, he also was a member of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work.

Their music is mainly characterized as post-rock mixed with electronic music elements. Their tracks often follow a scenario-based structure, which has led some critics to describe their music as \\"cinematic rock\\". History Misuse were formed in 2001 by Spiros Kintzios (guitar), Dimitris Patsaros (guitar), Costas Stergiou (keys), Christos Kormalis (drums) and were shortly afterwards joined by Stauros Maragkos (bass). In 2002 they record their first demo, consisting of 8 tracks and start performing live in the local scene. In 2005 Titos Moschakis takes the place of Spiros Kintzios and in the winter of the same year Christos Kormalis leaves the band. After a few months of inactivity, drummer Nikos Dimitrakakos (a.k.a. nid) joins the band. Sadly, on 18 September 2006, Christos Kormalis loses his life in a motorbike accident. His performance can be heard on the tracks \\"Locked in a bar\\" and \\"Enemy Lapdance\\" (these tracks were never re-recorded after the demo, partly as a tribute to Christos). Misuse have pointed out that he is always considered as an active member of the band. In 2007 Christos Alexopoulos of Puzzlemusik Records approaches Misuse and urges them to (at last) make an album. This leads a year later to the production of their first self-titled studio album which soon gets many and very positive reviews in the Greek press and online music websites.mic.gr Five out of the album's eight tracks are older tracks already recorded in their 2002 demo, recorded again from scratch, with a renewed approach. The album gets released in March 2008 by Puzzlemusik Records and Spinalonga Records on CD. In the following months the band performs live in various stages around Greece along many big names of the worldwide post-rock scene such as Mogwai (who have repeatedly picked Misuse for opening up their shows in Greece), Silver Mount Zion, Crippled Black Phoenix, Piano Magic and others. In summer 2010 Titos Moschakis leaves the band due to personal obligations. The band carries on as a quartet, writing a large amount of the music of their second album. After a short time they eventually decide that the gap of the second guitar must be filled in in order to sustain their arrangement methods and general style approach. Early 2011 Leuteris Volanis joins as guitar player. Mid-2011 finds Misuse in the studio producing the album \\"April\\" with the help of Spinalonga Records' Philip Kaponis as co-producer. The album gets released on 16 November 2011 by Puzzlemusik Records and Spinalonga Records. Misuse have often collaborated in their shows with visual artists such as \\"Hope\\". Some of their tracks have been choreographed and some have been featured in shows and documentaries in Greek television. Musical style In its first years the band's sound was influenced by alternative and heavy rock of the 90's, fused with string arrangements to form long lyrical and dynamical compositions. The self-titled debut album, consisting of tracks composed between 2001‚Äì2008, is rooted to guitar driven rock forms, alongside piano/keys and string arrangements. In a sense, it explores the possibilities within post-metal, progressive rock and instrumental rock. From 2009 to 2011 the acquirement and addition of new equipment, mostly modern electronic devices (such as iOS Applications, Samplers and Sequencers), leads the band to new ways of composing. Thus a new sound emerged which resulted in lengthy instrumental compositions, maintaining the bands' aesthetic signature, while fusing new elements that borrowed heavily from electronic genres in an unprecedented way.

Huberath. The novel has layers of nested stories, each of which is printed in a different font. This, along with its theme of books and reading, places it in the genre of metafiction. It was translated into English by Michael Kandel in 2014. Setting Nest of Worlds is set in a universe which resembles the real world, but with different physical laws and social organisation. Physics In the main story, the flow of time depends on the distance of a given person or object from the planet. The further a body is from the surface, the slower time flows for that body. For example, at the beginning of the novel, two of the main characters, Dave and Magda, make a journey covering the same distance. Dave travels by plane, while Magda travels by ship. As a result, Dave's journey takes thirty-six hours, while Magda's takes four years, although they start and finish their respective journeys at roughly the same time. The physics varies further in the embedded stories. Society The planet in the main story is divided into four countries. At the age of thirty-five, every individual must leave their native country and move to the next. After another thirty-five years they move again, and so on: if they live long enough, they may return to their home country. The reason behind these removals is not explained but none of the characters seems to question their purpose. Each country's society is organised according to racial criteria and divided into four castes according to hair colour. The hierarchy of castes is different in each country, so with each move, an individual's social position changes. Apart from a given name and surname, everyone also has a Significant Name, which, with inexplicable yet inevitable certainty, determines the cause of its owner's death. The Significant Name is chosen by the child's parents and there are twelve alternatives. Sulled, for example, means 'from oneself', Aeriel means 'from air', Myzzt means 'through brain'. Nested worlds The qualities of the universe of each embedded story remain in a relationship with the qualities of all other \\"nested worlds\\", which can be expressed by means of mathematical formulae. For example, in each successive world, the number of countries increases, while the time an individual spends there decreases. Plot The main character, Gavein Throzz (a.k.a. Dave) and his wife, Ra Mahlein√© (Magda), arrive in the country of Davabel, after an obligatory migration from their native country. As soon as they settle in, a series of mysterious deaths in occurs in their neighbourhood. The mystery, is not the manner of death (for they are always perfectly explicable), but the reason their number and why the victims have always met Gavein. The idea that Gavein is responsible for the \\"epidemic of deaths\\" starts as a vague suspicion, but becomes widespread. Meanwhile, Dave's colleague, Wilcox, reads Nest of Worlds, a book that will later drive him to insanity and suicide. Throzz is taken to the Division of Science, where physicians unsuccessfully attempt to kill him. During Dave's stay at the Institute, his friend, Zef, also starts reading Nest of Worlds but, unlike Wilcox, is influenced positively by the book. Dave escapes from the hospital, which is being destroyed by earthquakes accompanying the formation of a volcano. He comes home to find most of the household murdered (including Zef). After an unsuccessful attempt on his life‚Äîthis time by the army‚ÄîDave starts reading Nest of Worlds as a form of escapism. The book tells about a world similar to his but with slightly changed qualities. The characters, like Gavein, read a book called Nest of Worlds. In their book the world is still different and the characters also read Nest of Worlds‚Äîand so on and so forth. It is characteristic that what happens in a \\"nested world\\" largely depends on the readers from a higher level. If they read the book, the characters‚Äô lives speed up; if they stop reading it, the action slows down; if they reread any passage, it is never the same. Dave also reads notes that Zef had placed inside the book on slips of paper. Zef had been comparing the qualities of all the nested worlds and arranging them in mathematical formulae. These formulae show that the nested worlds constitute a logical continuum, suggesting that Gavein's world is also part of it, i.e. that Gavein is a character in a book. By \\"juggling numbers\\" Zef also infers the existence of our world and of the ultimate world, encompassing all other nested worlds, whose sole inhabitant is implicitly God. The protagonist concludes that the mysterious deaths occurred because somebody had been reading the book in which he is the main character. Therefore, when his wife is also dying, Gavein addresses that reader and asks him or her to stop reading the book, so that his and his wife's lives can be suspended. Unless the reader fulfils Dave's wish, they learn from the Epilogue, that, after his wife's death, Throzz will commit suicide to finish the \\"epidemic of deaths\\". He also reasons that if all worlds are books, then somewhere there must be a gigantic Library with a Catalogue, where all characters from all Nest of Worlds books can finally meet. In the end, it is suggested that Gavein finds his way to that place. Marek Oramus, in a review, argues that the hero does not reach the Catalogue but \\"ends up [...] in hell, degraded by three levels\\" to one of the embedded worlds.Oramus, Marek. Rozmy≈õlania nad tlenem. Przygody cz≈Çowieka czytajƒÖcego. Olsztyn: Solaris, 2000, p. 91. However, whatever the place in which Gavein finds himself after his suicide, it seems highly unlike any kind of hell as his surroundings in the final scene are all more beautiful than before.

Personal life He was born in Borge, √òstfold as a son of farmers Hans Ludvig Larsen Kviberg (1849‚Äì1917) and Karen Pedersdatter Heia (1848‚Äì1929). The family moved to Kristiania when Kviberg was four years old. In 1910 he married teacher Elisabeth Grude (1878‚Äì1941), a daughter of Martin Adolf Grude and sister of Karen Grude Koht. Career He graduated from Holmestrand Teacher's Seminary in 1902, and returned to Kristiania to work as a teacher. When the evening school Den socialdemokratiske Aftenskole was established in 1909, Kviberg was among the staff, and he became the school manager in 1911. He remained so until 1922. From 1921 to 1950 he was the headmaster at Lilleborg School. He also led the film-based education program in the city from 1921, and issued a publication named Filmen som undervisningsmiddel. Kviberg joined the Labour Party in 1908, and was a member of the city council from 1909 to 1934. As a teacher by profession, his first publication was the pamphlet on school policy, Folkeskolen i Kristiania, in 1913. In 1915 he issued Kampen om Gamle Aker, as he was fielded as Labour's candidate, with Sverre Iversen as deputy, in the single-member constituency Gamle Aker. He gathered 7,953 votes, but lost to the Conservative candidate Otto Bahr Halvorsen who had 11,458 votes. In 1921 he joined the new party Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway, a splinter party from Labour. He was the ninth ballot candidate for the party in the 1921 election. From 1924 to 1927 he chaired the city chapter of the Social Democratic Labour Party. He rejoined the Labour Party when the two parties reunited in 1927. During the Second World War he left his social democratic background, and joined the Communist part of the Norwegian resistance movement. He was arrested, and imprisoned in Grini concentration camp from 30 January 1945 to the war's end. After the war he represented the Communist Party in Oslo city council for two terms; from 1945 to 1951. He also wrote the history of his own school, Lilleborg skole gjennom 50 √•r 1898‚Äì1948.

The type species D. limbus was described in 1989 from a single skull found in the Naobaogou Formation. Daqingshanodon belongs to a group of dicynodonts called cryptodonts. It is the smallest known cryptodont, and the only one known from China. Like other cryptodonts, it has a pair of rounded nasal bosses above its nostrils and a ridge of bone on the upper jaw called the postcaniniform process. Daqingshanodon has a pair of elongated, recurved tusks extending from its beak-like snout. It is distinguished from other dicynodonts by the presence of a distinct ridge running along the side of the skull from below the eye socket to the area around the tusks. The skull of Daqingshanodon is less than long, yet this specimen is thought to have been an adult on the basis of its well-developed nasal bosses. In his 1998 study of dicynodont biogeography, paleontologist Spencer G. Lucas synonymized Daqingshanodon with Dicynodon, forming the species Dicynodon limbus. Most of the features used to distinguish Daqingshanodon as a distinct genus were also seen in specimens of Dicynodon. In 2011, a study of Dicynodon species included D. limbus in its phylogenetic analysis. D. limbus was placed among the cryptodonts, which are only distantly related to Dicynodon. With this phylogenetic placement, the genus Daqingshanodon was reinstated for D. limbus.

The bindings clipped onto the extension on the bottom of the sole. As was typical of the era, the boots are a rear-entry design. The Look Integral was a downhill ski binding that worked in conjunction with a custom ski boot made by Nordica. The Integral was fairly common in ski rental shops in the 1980s and into the 90s, but has since disappeared. Conventional ski bindings attach to flanges extending from the toe and heel of the ski boot. These are well- standardized in size and shape, under ISO 5355. However, as they are attached to the ends of the boots, the distance from the toe to heel changes from boot to boot. This requires the binding system to have the ability to move fore and aft on the ski to accommodate different sized boots. The \\"Integral system\\" moved these flanges to a small extension on the bottom of the sole of the boot. This extension was always the same size, so the Integral binding did not have to be adjusted for different sized ski boots. The system was designed for rental shops, eliminating the constant adjustments otherwise needed. Integral was offered since 1975 in Europe. In North America, Spademan offered a system with similar advantages that controlled the market. When Spademan failed, Integral moved in to replace them. During this introduction, Dynamic Skis also produced a small run of Look-branded skis to go with the package. Modern conventional bindings have greatly reduced the need for solutions like the Integral. Most bindings now have easy-to-adjust sizing based on a lever that locks into a rack plate on the ski. Others use a rack and pinion arrangement that moves the toe and heel bindings by the same amount by turning a single screw.

The location proved to be ideal for an airport, since the area is often clear while other parts of the San Francisco Bay are covered in fog.

Four days later it was renamed NAS Moffett Field. From the end of World War II until its closure, NAS Moffett Field saw the development and use of several generations of land-based anti-submarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft, including the Lockheed P2V Neptune and Lockheed P-3 Orion. Until the demise of the USSR and for some time thereafter, daily anti- submarine, maritime reconnaissance, Fleet support, and various training sorties flew out from NAS Moffett Field to patrol along the Pacific coastline, while Moffett's other squadrons and aircraft periodically deployed to other Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf bases for periods of up to six months.

Looking across its deck, planes and tractors look like toys. Along its length maintenance shops, inspection laboratories and offices help keep the hangar busy. Looking up, a network of catwalks for access to all parts of the structure can be seen. Two elevators meet near the top, allowing maintenance personnel to get to the top quickly and easily. Narrow gauge tracks run through the length of the hangar. During the period of airship, the rails extended across the apron and into the fields at each end of the hangar. This tramway facilitated the transportation of an airship on the mooring mast to the airship hangar interior or to the flight position. During the brief period that the USS Macon (ZRS-5) was based at Moffett, Hangar One accommodated not only the giant airship but several smaller non-rigid lighter-than-air craft simultaneously.  Hangars Two and Three  Moffett Field's Hangars Two and Three (Mountain View, California) were built at the beginning of WWII for a program of coastal defense. The Hangars are still among the world's largest freestanding unsupported wood structures. In 1940, the US Navy proposed to the US Congress the development of a lighter-than-air station program for anti-submarine patrolling of the coast and harbors. This program proposed the construction, in addition to the expansion at NAS and Lakehurst, the construction of new stations. The original contract was for steel hangars, long, wide and , helium storage and service, barracks for 228 men, a power plant, landing mat, and a mobile mooring mast. The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941, passed July 3, 1941, changed the authorization to the construction of 8 facilities to accommodate a total of 48 airships (as requested in 1940), but due to steel rations, a total of 17 large wooden hangars were built among 10 LTA bases. As finally developed in 1943, LTA facilities in addition to NAS Lakehurst (2) and NAS Moffett Field (2), included NAS South Weymouth (1), NAS Weeksville (1), NAS Glynco (2), NAS Richmond (3), NAS Houma (1), NAS Hitchcock (1), NAS Santa Ana (2) and NAS Tillamook (2). In the initial program, accommodations were provided for six airships at each station. This was later increased to twelve at seven of the stations and to eighteen at NAS Richmond as a result of an increase in the authorized strength to 200 airships. Seven (7) of the original seventeen (17) of the wooden hangars still exist: Moffett Field (2), Tustin, California (2), Tillamook, Oregon (1), and Lakehurst, New Jersey(2).  Popular culture  An episode of the Discovery Channel TV show MythBusters used one these smaller hangars to disprove the myth that it is not possible to fold a sheet of paper in half more than seven times. The sheet of paper covered nearly the full width of the airship hangar. Other episodes of Mythbusters have utilized the hangar to test myths such as \\"Inflating a football with helium allows longer kick distances\\" and \\"Airworthy aircraft can be constructed of concrete.\\"  Other historic buildings  Many of the buildings at Moffett Field which once supported its active military presence have been contaminated with asbestos within the structures, and require restoration.

The natives stated that they had dropped the gold in a water- filled shaft at the back of the cave. However, there appears to be no newspaper reports of this particular ambush and murders, though there is a report of two miners being murdered and the gold being buried on one of the river flats of the upper Trinity River.

She was one of the few Canadian corvettes to serve in action in both oceans. She was named for Dawson City, Yukon. Background Flower-class corvettes like Dawson serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail- driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Dawson was ordered on 14 February 1940 from Victoria Machinery Depot, Victoria, British Columbia as part of the 1939-1940 Flower- class building program. She was laid down on 7 September 1940 and was launched on 8 February 1941. She was commissioned into the RCN on 6 October 1941 at Victoria. In September 1943 Dawson began a major refit at Vancouver that saw her fo'c'sle extended. She had a second refit at Dartmouth that began in January 1945 that lasted until April. Wartime service Dawson was one of the few RCN ships that played an active role in both the Pacific War and the Battle of the Atlantic. After initial workups, she was assigned to Esquimalt Force. From 1942 to 1944 Dawson was deployed in an anti-submarine role on the Pacific coast as a local escort. In August 1942 she and her sister, HMCS Vancouver were assigned to the American invasion of the Aleutian Islands. There was little risk to the corvettes as they met very little resistance at sea. On 4 November 1942 she returned to Esquimalt. In February 1943 she returned to work with the United States Navy in Alaska until the end of May. After completing her major refit Dawson transferred to the Atlantic in February 1944. Upon arrival in March she joined escort group W-7 as part of the Western Escort Force. She escorted convoys from North America to the UK for the remainder of her war. After undergoing a second major refit, Dawson worked up in Bermuda in April 1945 but did not return to active service before the European part of the war ended. Post-war service Dawson was paid off on 19 June 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. The ship was sold for scrap on 5 October 1945. On the way to the breakers, she foundered near Hamilton, Ontario on 22 March 1946. She was raised and broken up.

The shortage caused soaring prices and stores' stocks of butter ran out within minutes of deliveries. According to the Danish tabloid B.T., Norway was gripped by sm√∏r-panik (\\"butter panic\\") as a result of the butter shortage. Shortage Norwegian traditional Christmas sweet bread called julebr√∏d or julekake (\\"Christmas bread/cake\\") sliced and spread with butter. Butter is a common ingredient in Norwegian Christmas fare, and prices were at their highest in December 2011. Heavy rains during the summer affected the grazing of cows and reduced milk production during the summer months by about , which led to increased butter prices. At the same time, demand increased rapidly ‚Äì a 20 percent increase in sales in October 2011 with a further 30 percent rise in November. An acute shortage resulted in prices soaring. A single pack of imported Lurpak butter cost NOK 300 (‚Ç¨39; ¬£32; $50) by mid-December 2011. For Norwegians, butter forms a staple part of the Christmas diet, and is particularly popular as part of a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich diet. Shortages persisted as a result of high import tariffs on butter to protect the domestic dairy industry against foreign competition, which meant that 90 percent of the butter on sale in Norway was produced domestically. The dairy industry estimated a deficit of 500 to 1000 tonnes, while the demand for butter had increased by 30 percent since 2010. Tine, which produced 90 percent of Norwegian butter at the time and was both the largest dairy cooperative in the country and the market regulator, was blamed by dairy farmers for not informing them about higher demand quotas and exporting too much butter despite a looming domestic shortage. Response In response to growing criticism, Tine asked the government to reduce tariffs to allow demand to be met with cheaper imports from neighbouring countries. The government responded by cutting the import duty by 80 percent to NOK 4 (‚Ç¨0.51; ¬£0.43; $0.66) per kilogram, from NOK 25 (‚Ç¨3.22; ¬£2.69; $4.18). However, according to a Tine spokesman, the move was unlikely to result in supplies of butter becoming available in large quantities until January 2012. There were calls for the Norwegian state monopoly to be reformed as a result of the butter crisis. The dairy industry's structure was created after the Second World War to keep prices high to protect small farms, but according to critics it is a de facto monopoly that failed to meet consumers' needs. The crisis prompted a variety of responses from individuals and organizations in Norway and neighbouring countries. A Norwegian newspaper sought to attract new subscribers by offering them a half kilogram of butter, while students auctioned butter on the Internet in a bid to raise funds for graduation parties. A number of individuals were apprehended by the authorities for attempting to smuggle butter across the border, while Swedes posted online adverts offering to drive butter to Norwegians at prices of up to NOK 460 (‚Ç¨59; ¬£50; $77) per packet. Danish dairy businessman Karl Christian Lund sought to drum up demand for his own butter by handing out thousands of packs in Kristiansand and Oslo, while Swedish supermarkets offered free butter to Norwegian customers to entice them to do their shopping across the border. On the Swedish side of the southeastern border at the Svinesund, stores reported selling twenty times as much butter as normal, with nine out of ten buyers being Norwegians. A Danish television show broadcast an \\"emergency appeal\\" for viewers to send butter and gathered 4,000 packs to be distributed to butter- starved Norwegians. Danish airports and ferries crossing the straits between the two countries kept a stock of butter in their duty-free stores. Aftermath As a result of the butter crisis, Norwegian retailers lost an estimated NOK 43m.FrP Requires Tine to Pay for Butter Crisis in Norway, 12 March 2012 The Progress Party has demanded that Tine compensate the retailers for their losses.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 30, 2011. In the episode, Leonard Powers is about to retire as the Wizard of Social Services and give the job to his apprentice, Lionel, whom he abandoned fifty years prior. Meanwhile, Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone must infiltrate the compound where the wizards hold the initiation ritual, but their complicated strategy involves building a summer camp with Mark Lilly as the head counselor. The episode was written by Daniel Powell and directed by Aaron Augenblick. Powell was inspired to write the episode after reading a critic's review of the series; the critic referred to Leonard as having \\"omnipotence\\", which spurred an idea involving the character having to take responsibility. \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" parodies the Harry Potter series, particularly the character design of Lionel. The Harry Potter elements were planned nine months in advance to coincide with the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2, which premiered two weeks after the episode aired. \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" received generally positive reviews from television critics; several commentators praised its cultural references and claimed that it showed similar quality to that of the series' first season. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" was watched by 1.14 million viewers in its original airing and attracted less viewers than the series' pilot episode. Plot Leonard Powers, the Wizard of Social Services, is about to retire and takes his apprentice to Mount Magic to complete the initiation ceremony. For a wizard to retire, they must hatch their apprentice from an egg and train them for fifty years. However, Leonard abandoned his apprentice, the Harry Potter-like Lionel, in Chinatown and did not contact him until the ceremony. Later, it is revealed that to become a wizard, the apprentices must be circumcised. Meanwhile, the demons‚Äîthe wizard's enemies‚Äîare ready to attack Mount Magic, but a force field is keeping them out. Since Leonard still needs to sign his retirement forms, demons Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone decide to use Mark Lilly to lead them to Leonard. To get Mark to come along, they elect him as the camp leader for a summer camp (originally a mining camp) that they build nearby. Mark brings his students from the Department of Integration to the camp, and the devil, Aldermach, brings several demons to act like the camp's visitors. The department's police officer, Frank Grimes, also comes along, but runs away to live with bears as he thinks the camp is infested by vermin. Mark's students and his roommate, the zombie Randall, begin to mine in an old silver mine. However, they get trapped inside, but Doug the koala begins to dig them out. At Mount Magic, Lionel is upset because Leonard abandoned him, and goes outside to the balcony, where he spots Callie swimming in the lake while wearing a bikini, and he declares that \\"she will be mine\\". Mark arrives at the lake and sees Leonard from the balcony and tells him that he forgot to sign his retirement forms. Leonard explains how to come to the secret entrance to Mark, which the demons hear. Later, Mark meets Leonard and Lionel at the entrance, where he signs his forms and is ready to retire. Moments later, when initiation ceremony begins at Mount Magic, the demons invade the compound and a battle between wizards and demons commences, while Lionel runs away to be with Callie, who, being the camp's \\"sexy counselor\\", has sex with him before Mark interrupts. Grimes arrives with his army of bears and soon thereafter, Doug arrives in a hole that he dug; the hole collapses the floor and all the demons and bears are consumed by it. As the battle ends, the sun goes down and it is too late for Lionel to be circumcised and take over as the Wizard of Social Services, so Leonard continues to work and begins to raise a new egg. Production Daniel Powell wrote \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\". \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" was written by Daniel Powell and directed by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: \\"We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just means we have a little more of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum.\\" Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do \\"topical stuff\\" as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were aware of the fact that the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. \\"So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice\\", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: \\"We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there. The episode explores Leonard's background and that he is \\"essentially a deadbeat dad\\". In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Powell revealed that he was inspired to write the episode after reading a critic's review which referred to Leonard as \\"basically [having] omnipotence\\" as he is able to conjure any magic he wants, but is too lazy to take advantage of his powers. The review spurred an idea for an episode where Leonard would be responsible for dealing with a kid. Powell called the episode's mythology \\"very bizarre and surreal\\", but said that they tried to keep the core themes relatable, such as Leonard's relationship with his estranged son. The same day as the episode's original broadcast, a deleted scene from \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" was made available on the official Ugly Americans website. In the half-minute clip, Grimes is shown settling into living his life as a bear. Reception The episode originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 30, 2011, following the Futurama episode \\"Ghost in the Machines\\". According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" was watched by 1.14 million viewers, compared to the 1.92 million who watched Futurama. The episode also acquired a 0.5 rating among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that 0.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds viewed the episode. It dropped in viewership compared to the series' pilot episode, which attracted 2.10 million viewers and acquired a 1.1 rating. \\"Wet Demonic Summer\\" also marked a drop in ratings compared to the first season finale, \\"The Manbirds\\", which received a 0.7 rating. \\"Wet Hot Demonic Summer\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it four out of five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is \\"equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves\\". Hinckley went on to remark that \\"Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated\\". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes \\"visual pizzazz\\", cultural references and \\"so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes\\" that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: \\"For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line...\\" Lastly, Wagner observed that \\"Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created\\". Josh Harrison of Ology deemed the episode a \\"good sign\\" that the second season will be \\"just as good, if not better\\" than the first season. He said, \\"The way it all works together in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness.\\" Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it \\"one of the best single sequences in the series so far\\". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it \\"tries a tad too hard\\". McDonough commented: \\"The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, that pretty much sums up Ugly Americans itself.\\" References External links  2011 American television episodes Ugly Americans (TV series) episodes Summer camps in television ","title":"Wet Hot Demonic Summer"},{"id":"34200406","text":"KASBI, Kongres Aliansi Serikat Buruh Indonesia (Congress of Indonesia Unions Alliance) is an Indonesian trade union formed in 2005 by 18 labor unions.\\"Profile of KASBI\\" blog post, Blogspot blog of Congress of Indonesia Unions Alliance, July 2, 2008 In 2011, they were engaged in a strike action with Carrefour, a French retailer which operates a hypermarket chain in Indonesia.

It contains 27 centuries of history. Mostly declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1995 (about 1021 hectares), it was included in the list of assets to be protected; its particular uniqueness lies in the almost total conservation and use of the ancient Greek road layout.  History  The historic center of Naples bears witness to the historical and artistic evolution of the city, from its first Greek settlement in the 8th century BC along the area overlooking the sea,. the refounding of the same city in a more internal area, constituting the \\"ancient center\\", up to the Spanish Baroque city that saw the opening towards the west of the urban nucleus and to that center of the nineteenth-century cultural elite, with the flowering in the city of numerous noble and bourgeois villas that characterize the whole area of Posillipo and Vomero. The area considered a UNESCO heritage site covers approximately 1021 hectaresPatrimonionellascuola.it and contains the following quarters: Avvocata, Montecalvario, San Giuseppe, Porto, Pendino, Mercato (Municipalit√† I), Stella, San Carlo all'Arena, (Municipalit√† III), Chiaia, San Ferdinando, San Lorenzo, Vicar√¨a e parte delle colline del Vomero e Posillipo. The Irpinia earthquake of 1980 damages part of the historical center and brings to light structural and social problems (even ancient ones) to which it is decided to remedy also urbanistic with the enactment of the law n. 219 1981, laying down provisions for the planning and control of building activity, sanctioning, recovery and rehabilitation of illegal construction. Currently, a large part of the historic center of the city is in poor conditions and suitable for conservation, in fact, many structures, in addition to the already mentioned churches of art (fountains, palaces, ancient architecture, sacred shrines, etc.) lie in conditions of extreme abandonment: to deal with this emergency, various citizens' organizations and committees are trying to get UNESCO to intervene. A recent agreement signed between the Campania region, the municipality and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, meant that the European Union allocated 100 million euros in June 2012 to carry out restoration workThe aforementioned funds were also used for other strategic works such as the works for the new underground and the reorganization of the area Oltremare. on the monuments of the historic center most at risk. Quarters that are part of the World Heritage  The Ancient Center  decumani The city has two true and original ancient nucleuses: the first is the hill of Pizzofalcone on which the city of Partenope was born, while the second is the zone of the decumani of Naples where the following Neapolis was born. In this last space, in particular, all the buildings over the centuries have concentrated until the 16th century, with the opening towards the west of the city at the behest of the Spanish viceroy don Pedro de Toledo. A particularly high number of cultural and artistic resources are on this site: obelisks, monasteries, cloisters, museums, the famous streets of the crib, catacombs, outdoor and underground archaeological excavations with Roman and Greek remains, including the Roman theater, statues and bas-reliefs, monumental friezes, as well as medieval columns supporting ancient historic buildings and much more. The Strozzi Table. In the fifteenth century, a closed Naples in the ancient area is highlighted Only the ancient center, which incorporates the districts of San Giuseppe, Porto, Pendino, Mercato, San Lorenzo and Vicar√¨a which, more specifically, correspond almost to the area of the decumans of Naples, sees the existence of more than 200 historic churches to which the activity of famous exponents of Italian art are linked. Among the main artists there are: Giotto, Caravaggio, Donatello, Giuseppe Sanmartino, Luca Giordano, Cosimo Fanzago, Luigi Vanvitelli, Jusepe de Ribera, Domenichino, Guido Reni, Tino di Camaino, Marco dal Pino, Simone Martini, Mattia Preti and many others. During the medieval era, the city was divided into seats. These were: Capuana, Montagna, Nido, Porto, Portanova and Forcella. In this context the city was closed by its walls beyond which there was an absolute prohibition of construction. The characteristic that distinguished the ancient center of Naples, in fact, is the almost foreclosure of the development in extension of the city, thus favoring that \\"in height\\". The circumstance that the city rests on tufaceous soil has favored practices of raising existing buildings, drawing the material from the underground quarries already used since the first birth of the city. However, the shift of political power to the Maschio Angioino was a first impulse for the local aristocracy to drag their noble residences towards the western part of the city.  The opening to the west with the Spanish viceroyalty  Don Pedro de Toledo The expansion of the city to the west, which took place in the 16th century with don Pedro de Toledo, entails the birth of the current \\"historic center\\". Thus the Spanish quarters were born, with Via Toledo, Largo di Palazzo, Via Medina up to the Pizzofalcone area and Chiaia. The royal palace, specifically, was the reason for a real hoarding by the Neapolitan and foreign aristocrats of the empty spaces rising along the road that went directly to the residence of the viceroy, ie via Toledo. These reforms determined in the city the \\"reconquest\\" of the sea which, since the advent of Partenope and until then, was no longer used.  The great buildings of the Bourbon period  Naples in the first quarter of the eighteenth century With the passage from the Spanish viceroyalty to the Bourbon kingdom, there is the definitive cultural leap in the city, which became the extreme destination of the European Grand Tour. Naples matures its own enlightenment conscience confirming itself as great European capital.Carlo Knight, Hamilton a Napoli. Cultura, svaghi, civilt√† di una grande capitale europea, Napoli Electa 2003 Within just twenty years (from 1730 to 1750) impressive buildings were born, symbol of the cultural level reached: the reggia di Capodimonte, the real Albergo dei Poveri and the Teatro di San Carlo. With the advent of the neoclassicism of the early nineteenth century (and also of the eclecticism of the end of the century), the historical center is also extended to the area of Posillipo and Vomero, exploiting these \\"new\\" spaces characterized by landscapes of particular beauty and by a large surrounding natural space. Thus the Villa Floridiana, Villa Rosebery and many other important Neapolitan villas are born.

It was given to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC in 1937. The NGA describes the work as a \\"majestic group portrait\\". Born Lady Elizabeth Howard (1746-1813), Lady Elizabeth (Howard) Delm√© was the third daughter of the 4th Earl of Carlisle, and sat for Reynolds with her children John and Isabella Elizabeth in April and June 1777. Reynolds was the chief proponent of the Grand Manner, and, as the NGA points out, the two years involved in completing the portrait would have aged the children noticeably. \\"But Reynolds worked from abstract principles of design rather than observation of nature,\\" the NGA writes, \\"One of his conceptions for Grand Manner likenesses was: Each person should have the expression which men of his rank generally exhibit. Reynolds therefore suppressed psychological individuality to gain a grandeur appropriate for these aristocrats.\\" In Grand Manner fashion, Reynolds alluded to the Madonnas of Raphael (such as the Madonna of the Goldfinch and the Madonna of the Meadow) in the triangular configuration of the sitters and alluded as well to the art of Rembrandt and Titian in the browns of the background. Reynolds was paid three hundred pounds for the work in 1780, and touched up and revarnished the picture in 1789. Cynthia Saltzman writes in Old Masters, New Worlds (2009) that \\"Lady Delm√© has a long, elegant face, heavy-lidded eyes, and towering powdered hair. She wears a white dress and a cloak that covers her knees in a cascade of rose-colored satin that speaks both to her beauty and to the luxury at her command.\\" Saltzman notes that Lady Delm√© is one of the finest representatives of Reynolds's intent to raise portraiture to the level of history painting. English portraiture of the period \\"flattered the sitter\\", Saltzman explains, by depicting the sitter as a member of a powerful ruling class whose very existence made the world a better place. Her life Lady Elizabeth Howard (1746-June 1813), married twice, first on 16 Feb 1769 to Peter Delm√©, M.P. (1748-1789), and secondly on 13 January 1794 to Capt. Charles Garnier, R.N., (d.1796 by drowning). Ruvigny described Lady Elizabeth as \\"the beauty of the Court of Queen Charlotte\\".

Containing nine separate papers produced by various scholars working in the fields of Anglo-Saxon archaeology and Anglo-Saxon history, the book presents a number of new perspectives on Anglo-Saxon paganism and, to a lesser extent, early Anglo-Saxon Christianity. The collection - published in honour of the archaeologist Audrey Meaney - was put together on the basis of a conference on \\"Paganism and Popular Practice\\" held at the University of Oxford in 2005. Opening with a foreword by Neil Price, the book's first paper, written by Carver, examines how archaeologists can best understand Anglo-Saxon paganism, drawing from the works of Price and David Lewis-Williams in order to do so. The second, written by Semple, looks at how pagan Anglo-Saxons viewed their surrounding landscape, whilst the third, written by Julie Lund, delves into Anglo-Saxon votive depositions into water. The fourth paper, authored by Howard Williams, looks at funerary practices, which is followed by Jenny Walker's study on the religious aspects of the hall. The sixth paper, produced by Aleks Pluskowski, delves into the roles of animals in Anglo-Saxon belief, while Chris Fern's following paper focuses on the role of the horse. The eighth paper, written by Sanmark, looks at conceptions of ancestors and the soul, while the ninth, co-authored by Sue Content and Howard Williams, looks at the subsequent understandings of Anglo-Saxon pagandom. In the afterword, written by historian Ronald Hutton, the findings of the book are summarised and potential areas of future research highlighted. The book received a mixed review in Charlotte Behr's review for the journal Anglo-Saxon England, and a positive one from Chris Scull in the British Archaeology magazine. It was praised by others looking at the field of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as Stephen Pollington. Background The origins for Signals of Belief in Early England came from a conference held in 2005 at the University of Oxford; based around the subject of \\"Paganism and Popular Practice\\", it had been organised by Sarah Semple and Alex Sanmark, two archaeologists who would go on to edit the volume. The decision to produce a book based on the papers presented at that conference gained a \\"renewed impetus\\" after two further academic conferences were held by the Sutton Hoo Society, on the subjects of paganism and Anglo-Saxon halls respectively.Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010. p. x. The collection was published in honour of the archaeologist Audrey Meaney, \\"in appreciation of her studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism.\\"Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010. p. v. In the foreword, archaeologist Neil Price commented on Meaney and her influential work, noting that most of the published studies that had previously delved into the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism came from her \\"monumental output\\", and that it was her \\"years spent patiently excavating Anglo-Saxon attitudes this collection honours.\\" Synopsis Preface In the book's preface, written by Martin Carver, Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple, the anthology's three objectives are laid out. The first of these is to establish that Anglo-Saxon paganism consisted of \\"a set of beliefs that varied from place to place\\" rather than being a dogmatic religion that was the same across England. The second objective is to show that the beliefs of the pagan Anglo-Saxons, \\"whether pure reason or intellectual mish-mash, [were] expressed in their material culture\\". Carrying on from the second, the third objective of the anthology was to show that through archaeology, contemporary scholars can \\"rediscover\\" Anglo-Saxon belief. Summing up their view of Anglo-Saxon paganism, the editors state that it \\"was not a religion with supraregional rules and institutions but a loose term for a variety of local intellectual world views\\". They also \\"extend the same courtesy to Christianity\\", noting that \\"Christianisation too hides a multiplicity of locally negotiated positions\\". Ultimately, the writers noted that neither \\"paganism nor Christianity are treated here as independent agents, out to confront and better each other. They are sources on which people, local people - the true agents of Anglo-Saxon England - eclectically drew. Price's \\"Foreword: Heathen Songs and Devil's Games\\" The book's foreword, entitled \\"Heathen Songs and Devil's Games\\", was written by the archaeologist Neil Price, then a professor at the University of Aberdeen. Price had previously been involved in the investigation of the pre-Christian religious beliefs of northern Europe, authoring the influential book, The Viking Way: Religion and War in the Later Iron Age of Scandinavia (2002). In his foreword, Price comments positively on Signals of Belief in Early England as a whole, noting that it is \\"remarkable that the present book represents the first attempt for nearly two decades to present an overall survey of early English beliefs that cannot be firmly situated within a Christian frame.\\"Price 2010. p. xiv. Ultimately, Price writes, Signals of Belief in Early England \\"simply represents the state of the art, with supporting references to the work on which it builds, and summarises with admirable caution and sensitivity most of what we currently know about the intricate mental world of the pre-Christian English. All future journeys through this difficult terrain must necessarily start here, and they could not have a better guide.\\"Price 2010. p. xvi. Carver's \\"Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda\\" In the first paper of the anthology, written by Martin Carver of the University of York, the author opens with a discussion of the work of Neil Price in his book The Viking Way (2002), which explored the existence of female shamans in pre-Christian Scandinavian society.Carver 2010. pp. 1-2. He proceeds to note that the work of Price and other academics has enabled contemporary scholars to understand historical paganism far better than ever before because they are \\"better equipped in that triad of disciplines\\"; archaeology, anthropology and history.Carver 2010. pp. 3-4. Carver then goes on to discuss the work of the archaeologist David Lewis- Williams in his book The Mind in the Cave (2002), which Carver argued has \\"redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists\\". Carver expresses his opinion that both Lewis-Williams' theories and his multidisciplinary approach (using methods drawn from disciplines like anthropology, psychology, art and ethnology) can be employed in order to shed light on the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism.Carver 2010. p. 4. He proceeds to point out several problems facing archaeologists in their study of Anglo-Saxon paganism,Carver 2010. p. 5. before looking at the ideas put forward by the archaeologists Colin Renfrew and Tim Insoll for how to best understand the cognitive aspects of historical religious beliefs.Carver 2010. pp. 6-7. Setting up a \\"programme for investigating Anglo-Saxon spirituality\\", Carver argues that those Anglo-Saxonist archaeologists who have focused their research on either the pagan or the Christian periods of Anglo-Saxon history need to interact with one another far more, before stating that the same is true for prehistorians and medievalists; in Carver's opinion, an understanding of the beliefs of the Early Anglo-Saxon period can only be achieved by understanding it as being, in part, a \\"continuum of prehistory\\". Moving on to discuss the burial monuments of Anglo-Saxon England and their relations with those found elsewhere in north-western Europe, Carver argues that we can understand more about the beliefs of people at the time by looking at the spread of specific burial styles.Carver 2010. pp. 8-11. He then looks at the assembly sites found in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that there is sufficient archaeological evidence for specific shrine structures, here drawing parallels with the work of archaeologist Leszek S≈Çupecki in relation to the pagan shrines of Slavic Europe. Going on to reference several excavations in northern Europe, Carver discusses the theory that halls were also used as ritual spaces, and considers whether the same could be true of Anglo-Saxon England.Carver 2010. pp. 11-14. In the third part of his paper, Carver deals with what he describes as \\"Christian variants\\", arguing that in his view, the archaeological evidence implies that \\"paganism and Christianity do not, in this period, describe homogenous intellectual positions or canons of practice. Pagan ideas and material vocabulary were drawn from a wide reservoir of cosmology and were recomposed as local statements with their own geographical and chronological context. I believe that the same kind of evidence, the evidence of monumentality, provokes us to a similar judgment of Christianity.\\"Carver 2010. pp. 14-15. For this reason, Carver argues, most individuals in 7th-century England were neither clearly Christian or pagan, but adhered to elements of both in a syncretic fashion.Carver 2010. p. 16. Semple's \\"In the Open Air\\" In the second paper of the anthology, entitled \\"In the Open Air\\", Sarah Semple provides an overview of what she refers to as the \\"pre-Christian sacred landscape\\". Opening the article, Semple discusses the theoretical trends behind recent Anglo-Saxon scholarship and looks at how these can enlighten our understanding of the Anglo-Saxon landscape; in doing so she argues in favour of an interdisciplinary approach which uses historical sources to back up archaeology, before then arguing for the use of continental European parallels to shed light on the world of Early Mediaeval England. Finally she argues that the landscape archaeology of Anglo- Saxon England has to be seen as an extension of the earlier prehistoric and Romano-British landscape rather than in isolation.Semple 2010. pp. 21-23. Initially describing \\"natural places\\" in the landscape, Semple discusses how the pagan Anglo-Saxons may have understood their surroundings, looking at the manner in which fields and groves were devoted to deities. Proceeding to look at the way in which pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons viewed hilltops, she discusses their association with sites designated as hearg in Old English. Semple then looks at the role of fissures, hollows and pits, highlighting how Anglo-Saxons believed them to be inhabited by monsters and goblins, before examining similar ideas regarding water-places, which were believed to be inhabited by nicor and which also saw some votive depositions occurring in the Early Mediaeval. Discussing votive offerings to such water-places, she then discusses the Anglo-Saxon attitude towards \\"ancient remains, monuments and ruins\\", discussing the re-use of prehistoric burial mounds and Roman-period structures. Rounding off her paper, Semple discusses evidence for pagan temples and shrines in the Anglo-Saxon landscape, as well as sacred beams, poles and totems.Semple 2010. pp. 24-48. Lund's \\"At the Water's Edge\\" The anthology's third paper was produced by Julie Lund, then a Senior Lecturer in archaeology at the University of Oslo in Norway. Entitled \\"At the Water's Edge\\", it looked at the relationship between the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons and watery areas such as rivers and lakes, relying particularly on comparisons from Scandinavia. Opening with a discussion of those votive offerings that had been deposited into water, it goes on to discuss the Early Mediaeval idea that objects, and in particular swords, had personalities, and how this might be related to their ritual deposition. Proceeding to discuss the role of rivers in the Anglo-Saxon cognitive landscape, it examines the archaeological evidence for votive deposits placed into them at this time, noting the wide array of weapons, but also jewellery and tools, which have been found.Lund 2010. pp. 49-54. Lund moves on to discuss the role of bridges, fords and crossings in both Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon contexts, arguing that they were significant sites in the latter's cognitive landscape, and that they were often used as the sites for votive offerings. She then discusses the role of lakes, noting that while there is ample evidence for votive deposition in Scandinavian lakes, there is currently none from Anglo-Saxon England. Finally, she looks at Christian attempts to suppress pagan ritual activity at watery places, and the revival which it experienced following the Scandinavian settlement of Britain.Lund 2010. pp. 54-66. Williams' \\"At the Funeral\\" The fourth paper in Signals of Belief was authored by Howard Williams, then a Professor of Archaeology at the University of Chester. Devoted to evaluating the evidence for pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon burial rites, it begins by explaining the approaches taken to this subject by earlier antiquarians and archaeologists. Moving on, Williams discusses the idea that mortuary practices in the Early Medieval Germanic-speaking world reflected pagan cosmology, eschatology, cosmogony and mythology, and describes those Scandinavian examples where aspects of the burial rituals have been interpreted as being symbolically related to elements of Norse mythology. Williams then discusses the role of cremation as a burial rite in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that the whole cremation process must be viewed as a series of ritualised events rather than as a singular occurrence. Proceeding to discuss inhumation burials, Williams once more argues that there would have been a series of different ritualised scenes as the corpse was prepared, laid in the grave, and then covered in soil, rather than simply one singular layout of the dead.Williams 2010. pp. 67-82. Walker's \\"In the Hall\\" A reconstructed Anglo-Saxon Hall; Walker devoted her paper to discussing the ritual uses of such buildings. The fifth paper of the anthology, authored by Jenny Walker, a graduate of the University of York's Department of Archaeology, explores the role that the great wooden halls served as \\"ritual theatre[s]\\" in Anglo-Saxon paganism, using the Northumbrian site of Yeavering as a case study. Commenting on earlier approaches to understanding the relationship between religious practices and the Early Medieval hall both in England and Scandinavia, she highlights the influence of post-processual archaeology in altering earlier culture-historical perspectives on this subject. Referencing the theories of sociologist Anthony Giddens, Walker maintains that the role of both human agency and ideology in constructing the halls \\"as a political act\\" must be taken into account by archaeologists adopting a post-processual approach. Proceeding to discuss the evidence for three of the halls excavated at Yeavering by archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor in the early 20th century - buildings A2, D2b and Bab - she then goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for two Scandinavian examples, Upp√•kra in Skana, Sweden, and Borg at Vestv√•g√∏y, Norway, both of which show evidence for ritual activity. Concluding her paper, Walker emphasises the diversity in uses that halls in Anglo-Saxon England - and wider Northwestern Europe - had been put in the Early Medieval. Some, she asserts, would have been used for both socio-political and socio- religious activities, while others would have been explicitly reserved for just one of these activities.Walker 2010. pp. 83-102. Pluskowski's \\"Animal Magic\\" Aleks Pluskowski - an Archaeology Lecturer at the University of Reading - offers the anthology's six paper, an exploration of the role that non-human animals played in pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon religion. Opening with a discussion of the \\"zoomorphic\\" symbolism of Early Anglo-Saxon art, he also lists the various different species, both wild and domestic, that the people of Anglo-Saxon England would have been familiar with from their daily lives. Pluskowski then moves on to look at the zoomorphic symbolism found on shields, themselves symbols of adult masculinity in Anglo-Saxon England, before providing a discussion of the idea that animals offered \\"windows to cosmology\\", representing symbols of different mythological figures and cosmological places that contemporary scholarship is unaware of, in doing so referencing the work of Stephen Glosecki. Proceeding to examine the symbolic use of animals in Anglo-Saxon warfare, he rounds off this chapter by dealing with both comparisons from continental Europe and Scandinavia and by looking at the influence that Christianity had on re-deploying the symbolism of zoomorphic designs.Plusckowski 2010. pp. 103-127. Fern's \\"Horses in Mind\\" In his paper, Chris Fern, an independent archaeologist and Research Associate of the University of York, explored the role of the horse in Anglo- Saxon paganism. Remarking that the horse was \\"a motif with socio-political, heroic and spiritual significance\\" for the early Anglo-Saxons, he begins with a brief overview of the importance of horses in the preceding prehistoric and Roman periods of British history. Moving on to explore the ceremonial usages of horses in Anglo-Saxon England, he first examines the archaeological evidence for horses who had been cremated or placed in inhumation burials, including those from sites such as the Snape ship burial who had been ritually beheaded. Fern follows this with an examination of horses depicted in Anglo- Saxon art, noting the predominance of motifs featuring either two fighting stallions or a warrior riding a horse, the latter being an image which Fern argues had been adopted from Imperial Rome. He also puts forward the theory that the geometric stamps found imprinted on pots represented horse branding marks. Proceeding to look at horses featured in documents from the period, Fern discusses the mythological figures Hengist and Horsa who appear in Bede's 8th-century Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, as well as the role that the former played in the epic poem Beowulf. Turning his attention to the human consumption of horse flesh in this period, he argues that it was only eaten rarely, usually as \\"a sacred activity\\".Fern 2010. pp. 128-157. Sanmark's \\"Living On\\" The penultimate paper in the anthology, \\"Living On: Ancestors and the Soul\\", is authored by Alexandra Sanmark, then a post doctoral Research Associate at the Millennium Institute Centre for Nordic Studies and Lecturer at the University of Western Australia's Department of History. In it, she takes a primarily historical approach to studying Anglo-Saxon conceptions of the soul, utilising comparisons from Norse paganism, which she recognises offers contemporary scholars \\"an echo or an analogy\\" of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Beginning by discussing the structure of Norse religious thinking, she describes the division between the \\"higher religion\\" devoted to the cult of the gods and the \\"lower religion\\" devoted to the veneration of animistic deities; Sanmark includes the Norse \\"cult of the ancestors\\" within this latter category. Expanding on this by exploring the Norse conception of the soul and the manner it which it might migrate in an animal form, she then turns her attention to similar evidence from Anglo-Saxon England, in particular discussing the ideas regarding an Anglo-Saxon shamanic tradition advocated by Stephen Glosecki. At first dealing with the literary evidence from Anglo-Saxon poems like The Seafarer, she then turns her attention to the evidence from Anglo-Saxon art, again citing the theories of Glosecki. Looking at the link between an ancestor cult and places of burial - namely burial mounds, which she considers to be places of communication between the living and the dead - she makes use of Norse historical texts and ethnographic evidence from Eastern Europe to argue that the Anglo-Saxons probably used burial mounds for the same purposes. Moving on to look at the relation between the ancestors and the ritual consumption of alcoholic beverages, she primarily makes use of Norse sources, before discussing the role of the malevolent ancestors in the pre- Christian Anglo-Saxon worldview, highlighting the theories regarding deviant burials advocated by archaeologist Andrew Reynolds.Sanmark 2010. pp. 158-180. Content and Williams' \\"Creating the Pagan English\\" The final paper of the anthology, \\"Creating the Pagan English: From the Tudors to the Present Day\\", is the product of a collaboration between Howard Williams and Sue Content, a doctoral student at the University of Chester's Department of History and Archaeology. An overview of the history of Anglo-Saxon archaeological investigation into pre-Christian religion, it begins by looking at the manner in which the Anglo-Saxon pagans were glorified as proto- Protestants under the regime of the Tudor monarchs by the likes of Polydire Vergil and William Camden, before highlighting how Roman Catholic writers such as Richard Verstegen counteracted this by portraying these pagans as barbaric. Chronologically proceeding to the 18th century, he discusses the Nenia Britannica, a proto-archaeological work authored by the Reverend James Douglas which discussed the material evidence for early Anglo-Saxon belief. Moving into the Victorian era, Content and Williams note that the period between circa 1845 and 1860 was important for the antiquarian investigation of Anglo- Saxon paganism, in particular making reference to the work of John Young Akerman and John Mitchell Kemble. They argue that following the deaths of these two figures, there was a period of stagnation in Anglo-Saxon archaeology lasting until 1910, when interest in the subject once more emerged.Content and Williams 2010. pp. 181-200. Hutton's \\"Afterword: Caveats and Futures\\" The book's afterword, entitled \\"Caveats and Futures\\", was written by the English historian Ronald Hutton (1953-), then working at the University of Bristol. At the time a Commissioner for English Heritage, Hutton had previously written about Anglo-Saxon paganism in a chapter of his book The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy (1991).Hutton 1991. Hutton notes that the collection exposes Anglo-Saxon England as a \\"world of fluid religious identities\\" in which people \\"pick and mix between religious systems\\", developing \\"their own idiomatic and personal manifestations\\" of belief and practice. Reception and recognition Academic and popular reviews In a review published in the academic journal Anglo-Saxon England, Charlotte Behr of Roehampton University noted that Signals of Belief in Early England differed from many conference volumes in that the archaeologists who authored the book's papers appear to have undertaken \\"intense discussions\\" about how to carry out their research and interpret the evidence. Although she believed that there was much to commend in the anthology, she was wary that words like \\"superstitious\\", \\"magical\\", \\"numinous\\", \\"sacred\\", \\"sanctified\\" and \\"supernatural\\" had been used in a loose way as if they were synonyms despite the fact that they have distinct meanings. She was also critical of \\"two dozen spelling errors\\" and \\"minor factual mistakes\\" that made it into the text, but ultimately considered the presentation of the book to be \\"pleasing\\".Behr 2011. Robert J. Wallis reviewed the book for Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture, noting that it would be enjoyed by those who liked the theoretical positions adopted in the 1990s, and that much of the language used is similar to that which has been employed in Bronze and Iron Age Studies. Expressing that its post-processualist angle has given Anglo-Saxon archaeology \\"a sharper edge\\", he opines that it constitutes essential reading for those interested in this area, but that a greater attention to anthropological theory, particularly regarding concepts of animism, shamanism, and totemism, needs to be developed.Wallis 2012. Writing in the Council for British Archaeology's bimestrial magazine, British Archaeology, the Early Medievalist Chris Scull praised Signals of Belief in Early England, opining that it should be \\"required reading\\" for any researcher investigating Anglo-Saxon beliefs. Arguing that the book was \\"[s]timulating and provocative\\", he believed that the most successful essays were those that engaged directly with the \\"material evidence and near-contemporary texts\\" rather than those which used later Scandinavian sources. Scull furthermore expressed his view that archaeologists should now discard the terms \\"pagan\\" and \\"paganism\\" when \\"considering the belief-worlds of early England.\\"Scull 2011. Legacy In the year following the publication of Signals of Belief in Early England, the established Anglo- Saxonist Stephen Pollington published an overview of Anglo-Saxon paganism entitled The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England.Pollington 2011.

Biography Vernon was born in New York City in 1905. He was in show business from the age of three, appearing in vaudeville and stock theater; he made his first Hollywood appearance in 1937's Mountain Music. He made more than 75 films altogether, almost always playing a Brooklynese wiseguy and/or the hero's assistant. He was a fixture in Twentieth Century Fox features of the late 1930s and early 1940s; Vernon's considerable skill as an eccentric dancer is most fully seen in Fox's Alexander's Ragtime Band (1938), where he appears as himself. Vernon freelanced at other studios after leaving Fox. He became the unlikely sidekick to cowboy star Don \\"Red\\" Barry at Republic Pictures, and when Barry began producing his own features in 1949, he remembered Vernon and brought him back as his sidekick. In 1948 Columbia Pictures producer Jules White paired Wally Vernon with Eddie Quillan, another breezy comedian with a vaudeville background. White emphasized extreme physical comedy in films, and Vernon and Quillan gamely indulged in pratfalling, head-banging, kick-in-the-pants slapstick.

Biography He was born in Morgan County, Georgia, the son of a sharecropper and the youngest of seven children. The family later moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where he learned slide guitar and later steel guitar. He performed with the Westernaires as steel guitarist, and in the early 1950s, after moving to Gainesville, joined country band Smilin' Jack Herring and his Swingbillys. The band's other members were Herring, Pee Wee Jenkins, and Bob Chisolm. Biography by Ronnie D. Lankford Jr at MusicianGuide.comSmilin' Jack Herring and His Swingbillys While playing with the Swingbillys, Durden began writing the lyrics for \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", inspired by a Miami Herald story about a man who committed suicide, leaving a note that read \\"I walk a lonely street\\". He took the half-written lyrics to his friends and occasional songwriting partners Mae Boren Axton - who worked as a part-time disc jockey and publicist for Colonel Tom Parker's client Hank Snow - and Glenn Reeves. While Reeves thought the idea of the \\"lonely street\\" leading to a \\"heartbreak hotel\\" was not worthy of a song and turned down the offer of a co-writing credit, Axton composed a tune, and recorded an initial version with Durden. Another account from a radio-station owner has it that Durden had written the song in its entirety months previous and had already been performing it onstage. In any case, the song was recorded as a demo by Reeves who had a better singing voice. Axton had promised to write a song for Elvis Presley and presented Presley with the demo at a 1955 disc jockey convention in Nashville. Presley liked the song, and he and Parker, his manager, agreed that he should record it so long as he was given a co-writing credit, which Axton and Durden accepted. \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" eventually became Presley's first record on RCA Records and his first number one hit. Biography by Bruce Eder at Allmusic.com Obituary by Spencer Leigh, The Independent, 3 November 1999 Although Durden continued to write songs with Axton and Reeves, including \\"Honey Bop\\" which was recorded by Wanda Jackson in 1960, none had anything approaching the success of \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\". By 1958, he had set up a song poem business in Dayton, Ohio, setting submitted lyrics to music for a fee. \\"Tommy Durden\\", American Song-Poem Music Archives.

He moved to live in Houghton Lake, Michigan, and worked as a commercial dishwasher repairman until retiring in the early 1980s.

The representative team of the African Rugby Board was known as the Leopards. Early black rugby and the first union As with the game among whites, clubs for black and coloured players emerged before unions were established, and before that may have started in missionary schools. Black rugby received a considerable boost from the missionaries who introduced the game to their schools for indigenous peoples. A region that particularly benefitted from such intervention was the Eastern Cape, which remained the stronghold of black rugby until the present day. Canon Robert John Mullins,Odendaal's impression that Mullins was the headmaster of St Andrew's (p.55) is not borne out by the website of that school, nor by other sources, which does affirm Mullins' position as principal of the Kaffir [sic] Institution . headmaster of the Kaffir [sic] Institution from 1864, is usually credited as the first to introduce rugby to blacks, in the shape of his students. Mullins is the father of rugby international Cuth Mullins, who played forward for the 1896 British touring team to South Africa. The Institution was initially a branch of the all-white St Andrew's College in Grahamstown, where Mullins had been a teacher. Rugby was first played at St Andrew's in 1878. The earliest black rugby club probably was the Union Rugby Football Club, founded in 1887 at Port Elizabeth, with games played on the grounds where the current hospital stands. Union's first opponents were local coloured teams, but soon other black clubs were established in the city, including Orientals (founded 1894), \\"followed by the Morning Star, Rovers, Frontier and Spring Rose Clubs\\". Rovers and Union in turn had formed the Port Elizabeth Union by 1897. Inter-town contests were a fixture of black rugby before the end of the 19th century, with challenges occasionally issued via black newspapers such as the Xhosa-language Imvo Zabantsundu. The earliest attempt to establish a national rugby governing body for players of colour was the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board (SACRFB), formed in 1897 during South Africa's British colonial period. The SACRFB emerged from a meeting of all clubs and unions called to Kimberley by the Griqualand West Colonial Rugby Football Union. Black administrators like Bud Mbelle had earlier persuaded Cecil John Rhodes to provide a trophy like the Currie Cup to \\"'all the coloured Sporting People if South Africa'\\". The SACRFB then organized a domestic rugby competition for the Rhodes Cup, which started in 1898 and was first won by Western Province. In 1905 black clubs formed the Eastern Province Native Rugby Union, whose president was Tobias Mvula. Founding of the Board The first rugby governing body devoted to organizing black rugby was the South African Bantu Rugby Board (SABRB), which broke away from the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board in 1935. Black rugby players and administrators was initially drawn primarily from the emerging black middle class, who also were involved in other sports transplanted to South Africa by 19th century British colonists. Accordingly, discussions about forming a Bantu Rugby Board began in 1935 with a committee formed for that purpose, continued during an inter-town rugby tournament at East London, and was concluded at the inter-provincial cricket tournament at Port Elizabeth. SABRB's first officers included J.M. Dippa of Port Elizabeth as president and Halley Plaatje, son of Sol Plaatje, of Kimberley as secretary. The Bantu Rugby Board arranged the first of its annual inter-provincial tournaments in 1936 in Kimberley,One source indicates that the tournament was held in Port Elizabeth.Rugby in South Africa I: Early History in which Transvaal and Eastern Province shared the title after a goalless draw. Other participants included the Northern Eastern Districts from Aliwal North and Griqualand West, but not Western Province, Border or Natal. These tournaments were sponsored by the Chamber of Mines with a trophy called the Native Recruiting Corporation Cup, commonly known as the NRC Cup. Meanwhile the Coloured Rugby Football Board selected its first national side in 1938. In turn, the Bantu Rugby Board initiated test matches with their coloured counterparts to forge a sense of unity. Conflict and alliances in the apartheid era In 1959 the Bantu Rugby Board changed its name to the South African African Rugby Board, as \\"Bantu\\" had acquired pejorative overtones due to its use by the apartheid state to segregate blacks, reduce their access to land and economic opportunities, and remove their civil and political rights. As the struggle for political rights intensified in South Africa, black sports bodies came under increasing pressure to strengthen links with white governing bodies, or sever them. Proponents of either position hoped to attempt to transform white governing bodies by co-operation or by opposing them. The African Rugby Board decided to affiliate with the white South African Rugby Board in 1978, just as the Rugby Football Federation did. In 1966 the Coloured Rugby Football Board changed their name to the South African Rugby Union (not to be confused with the current body of that name), and in 1973 became a founding member of the anti- apartheid South African Council on Sports whose slogan argued that there could be no normal sport in an abnormal society. The decision by the African Rugby Board and the Rugby Football Federation to join forces with the Rugby Board cost their players dearly in terms of criticism from home and abroad, and also disqualified them from national recognition in the post-apartheid era. When the South African Rugby Union rewarded black and coloured rugby players who had represented their governing bodies in national teams with Springbok blazers, players who had not been selected for the multi-racial body were excluded from this honour on the basis that they could, technically, have qualified for selection as Springboks from 1978 onwards.

He then accepted an invitation from M. G. Evans FRS to work in England as an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester (1950‚Äì54) in the department created by Michael Polanyi. He was subsequently lecturer and then reader in the Department of Chemistry, University of Bristol (1955‚Äì71). He returned to Australia in 1971 to found the Department of Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Sydney, the first such department in Australia. In 1989 he became a full-time research-only emeritus professor. He has held numerous prestigious visiting scientist positions at universities in Australia, the UK, and the US. Adiabatic electron transfer A unifying theme of Hush's research is explanation of chemical electron transfer. This is the basis of oxidation‚Äìreduction processes, which are ubiquitous in nature in both the inorganic and biological spheres. The mechanism of these reactions‚Äîthe simplest of which proceed without making or breaking chemical bonds‚Äîremained unknown until the mid 1950s, when several independent theoretical studies showed that it was due to modulation of coupling between electronic and vibrational motions. According to his Royal Society election citation, Hush's research in the area of homogeneous and heterogeneous electron transfer showed that electron transfer occurring during a collision between a molecule and either another molecule or an electrode surface occurs adiabatically on a continuous potential-energy surface, and that electron transfer can occur by either optical or thermal mechanisms with the corresponding rates being closely connected.

Sochatchov is a branch of Kotzk Hasidism, which in part is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism. After World War I the dynasty was moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and, subsequently, to other nearby towns. After World War II the dynasty was transplanted to Israel, where it thrives to this day. History Leadership in Poland ohel (gravesite) of the Avnei Nezer and the Shem Mishmuel in Sochaczew. The founder of the dynasty, Avrohom Bornsztain was a leading posek (Jewish legal authority) in 19th-century Poland. He was a close disciple of Menachem Mendel Morgenstern (a disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa) and married the Kotzker Rebbe's daughter. After the Kotzker Rebbe's death, Bornsztain became a Hasid of his uncle, Yitzchak Meir Alter, the Chidushei HaRim of Ger. Following the latter's death in 1866, he became a hasid of Chanoch Heynekh of Alexander. When the Alexander Rebbe died in 1870, Bornsztain agreed to become a Hasidic rebbe himself. From 1883 until his death he served as Rav and av beis din (head of the rabbinical court) of Sochaczew (Sochatchov), becoming known as the Sochatchover Rebbe. The homilies that he delivered before his Hasidim on Shabbat were collected and printed in the book Ne'ot Deshe. His voluminous responsa on every section of Shulchan Aruch were published posthumously in seven volumes under the title Avnei Nezer (\\"Stones of the Crown\\"). Shmuel Bornsztain, the Shem Mishmuel. His only son, Shmuel Bornsztain, succeeded him as av beis din of Sochatchov and second Sochatchover Rebbe. From his childhood, Shmuel's primary teacher was his father, and he continued to live near him even after his marriage. Upon his father's death in 1910, he was accepted as Rebbe by all his father's Hasidim. He established a Sochatchov yeshiva, Yeshivat Beit Avrohom, first in Sochaczew and later in Zgierz. He delivered many shiurim (Torah lectures) to his Hasidim on the topics of the weekly Torah portion and Jewish holidays, primarily based on the teachings of his father. These teachings were posthumously published in the nine-volume Shem Mishmuel. In 1915 the town of Sochaczew was destroyed by the German army and the Rebbe re-established his court in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In 1919 he moved his court to Zgierz, a small town near ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He died in 1926. Rabbi Dovid Bornsztain, third Sochatchover Rebbe. The third Sochatchover Rebbe, Dovid Bornsztain (1876-1942), eldest son of Shmuel Bornsztain, grew up near his grandfather, the Avnei Nezer, who was his primary teacher. After his marriage, he lived in his grandfather's house, continuing to learn from him.Harav Dovid Bornstein -- The Sochatchover Rebbe. Hamodia Features, 11 November 2010, p. C3. He served as the Rav of Vishgorod, where he established a yeshiva patterned after the Sochatchov learning style, and served as Rav of Tomashov after World War II. Upon his father's death in January 1926, Bornsztain was appointed third Sochatchover Rebbe by his father's Hasidim. He established his court in Pabianice, near ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and founded a network of yeshivas under the name Yeshivat Beit Avrohom in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Warsaw, and other Polish cities. He was an active member of Agudath Israel of America and the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah and became known as one of the generation's leading Rebbes. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the Rebbe was smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto on forged documents. His home became a center for Torah study and gatherings of rabbis and activists. He supervised the education of several hundred Sochatchover yeshiva students in the ghetto. When the deportations began, the Rebbe hid in a shop on 67 Genesha Street, where he died of heart failure on 17 November 1942. His wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren were all murdered by the Nazis in the spring of 1943. All of the Rebbe's many manuscripts were destroyed, save for a few pages containing chidushim (new Torah thoughts) on the Passover Haggadah. These pages were later published as Chasdei Dovid together with the ninth volume of Shem Mishmuel, his father's work, which deals with the Haggadah. Leadership in Israel The fourth Sochatchover Rebbe was Chanoch Henoch Bornsztain (d. 1965), the younger brother of Dovid Bornsztain, who had emigrated to Palestine in 1924 and opened a beis medrash in Jerusalem. After World War II, he accepted the request of the surviving Sochatchover Hasidim to be their leader and established his court in Jerusalem, preferring to remain in that city even during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when his followers in Tel Aviv urged him to join him there.Growise, Yisroel Alter. The Sochatchover Rebbe, Harav Menachem Shlomo Bornstein, zt\\"l, 40 Years Since His Tragic Passing. Hamodia Features section, 27 August 2009, pp. C4-5. He led the dynasty until his death in 1965. The fifth Sochatchover Rebbe was Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain (1934-1969), eldest son of Chanoch Henoch Bornsztain. He was officially known as the Sochatchover- Radomsker Rebbe, since he was the great-grandson of the third Radomsker Rebbe (through his maternal lineage) and was asked by the Radomsker Hasidim who had survived the Holocaust to become their Rebbe as well. While his father was alive, he served as Rav of the Sochatchover shtiebel in Tel Aviv and Rav of the Yad Eliyahu neighborhood. He died in an automobile accident in August 1969 at the age of 34. The sixth Sochatchover Rebbe is Shmuel Bornsztain (b. 1961), eldest son of Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain. He was 8 years old at the time of his father's death, and became Rebbe a few years later. He presently leads the Sochatchover dynasty from Bayit Vegan, Jerusalem, where the Sochatchov yeshiva, Yeshivat Avnei Nezer, is located. Teachings The Avnei Nezer and his son, the Shem Mishmuel, produced a body of teachings that are widely acknowledged as halakhic and homiletic Torah classics. The homiletic essays of the Shem Mishmuel have earned a following in both the Hasidic and non-Hasidic world, and are quoted in many Torah shiurim and books.

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 12, 2012. It was written by Steve Hely and was directed by executive producer B. J. Novak. In this episode, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) reveals that he is partaking in a trivia contest in Philadelphia and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to get the entire office involved. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) journeys to Florida and meets with his boss, Robert California (James Spader), in order to explore other job opportunities. After airing, the episode sparked a debate among fans, as well as critics, as to whether former leading actor Steve Carell had made an uncredited cameo as a member of an opposing trivia team. NBC later denied that Carell had made an appearance and stated that the situation was just a coincidence. \\"Trivia\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many noting that the episode marked an improvement from the first part of the season. Despite this, several reviews were critical of the Dwight sub-plot. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Trivia\\" drew 5.87 million viewers and received a 2.9 rating/7% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, staying relatively even with the previous three episodes, \\"Christmas Wishes\\", \\"Gettysburg\\" and \\"Mrs. California\\". It ranked third in its timeslot and was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Plot Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), worried that he will not be able to meet the 8% quarterly sales growth figures that Robert California (James Spader) asked for by about $800, proposes that everyone in the office buy paper to alleviate some of the burden, but no one is willing. He then asks Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to make a rounding mistake in the books. Oscar tells Andy that he does not have time to make the mistake because he is leaving for a trivia contest with a $1,000 prize in a bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Andy, encouraged by Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), decides to take the entire office to Philadelphia in an attempt to win the money and make up the sales growth difference. At the bar, which turns out to be a gay bar called the Liberty Well, Andy divides the office into three teams: the A-Team consisting of Jim, Darryl, Andy, and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), the B-Team consisting of Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad), and the \\"Just For Fun\\" team consisting of Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery). Oscar refuses to join Andy and stays on his original team. Initially, the Dunder Mifflin A-Team does well but soon falter. However, the \\"Just For Fun\\" team (calling themselves The Einsteins) does much better than expected because of the group's trivial knowledge on a variety of issues (though at one point, they ironically get a question about Albert Einstein wrong). They make it to the final round against Oscar's team and eventually win thanks to Kevin's correct answers. However, the Just for Fun team later get demolished while trying to win another bar's even more lucrative trivia contest. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) heads down to Florida to meet with Robert California at the Sabre headquarters to discuss a possible manager position. While sitting in the waiting room, Dwight talks to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), who describes himself as the \\"toilet of the company\\" who flushes all the unwanted items away. Robert then tells Dwight that he cannot meet with him but will have him meet with Bill, another executive, much to Dwight's frustration. Robert secretly calls Gabe and instructs him to not let Dwight speak with Bill either, but to listen to Dwight's pitch and then reject him. Gabe can barely keep a straight face throughout Dwight's pitch. Dwight, after being told by Gabe that Dwight isn't wanted as a manager, grabs and twists Gabe's arm and forces him to take him to Robert's Florida condo. Initially, Robert tries to spare Dwight's feelings, attempting to give him a medal as a sign of respect. Dwight resists, so Robert eventually turns him down by telling him he is a better salesman and his drive and energy would be wasted in a manager's position. Dwight then returns to Scranton. Production \\"Trivia\\" was directed by series star B. J. Novak. The episode was written by supervising producer Steve Hely, at the time, his second writing credit for the series. It was directed by executive producer and cast member B. J. Novak, who portrays Ryan Howard on the show. The episode also marks the fifth appearance of Lindsey Broad, who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season and she initially appeared in \\"Pam's Replacement.\\" Due to Jenna Fischer's actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode. After airing, the episode sparked a debate among fans, as well as critics, as to whether former leading actor Steve Carell had made an uncredited cameo as a member of an opposing trivia team, The Queerstein Bears. NBC later denied that Carell had made an appearance and stated that the situation was just a coincidence. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Andy attempting to get the office to sell $800 worth of paper in a day, and Andy trying to switch team members in order to boost Dunder Mifflin A-Team's chance of winning. Cultural references Due to the episode largely taking place at a trivia contest, \\"Trivia\\" featured a plethora of cultural references. After Ryan uses his smart phone, the trivia reader chides him for checking his Grindr account, a geosocial networking application for gay men. Dwight compares himself to a Spanish conquistador, coming to Florida to \\"claim what is rightfully [his].\\" Several of the trivia teams featured names with culturally related puns. The teams included: The Queerenstein Bears, Joey Triviani, Impish Impresarios, Two Broke Dorks, Jason So-Gay-Kiss, Ladies Gaga, Aesop's Foibles, and Lawrence O-Trivier. Many of the references were either the answers to trivia questions, or incorrect guesses. The \\"Einsteins\\" erroneously guess \\"See-atle\\" when asked what city was on Ray Charles' mind when he wrote one of his most famous songs. After being asked a question about Albert Einstein, the \\"Einsteins\\" answer with Thomas Edison, much to the delight of the sarcastic trivia reader. Kelly is able to correctly guess a basketball question because she cross-referenced her knowledge of Khloe and Lamar and Dancing with the Stars. Kevin knows that the answer to the final trivia question is the 2001 French film Les Jolies Choses, starring Marion Cotillard, because Cotillard \\"exposes herself a number of times.\\" Reception Ratings \\"Trivia\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 12, 2012. The episode was viewed by an estimated 5.87 million viewers and received a 2.9 rating/7% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.9% of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 7% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode remained relatively equal in ratings compared with the previous episode, \\"Christmas Wishes.\\" The episode finished third in its time slot, being beaten by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.8 rating/9% share and the CBS drama Person of Interest which received a 3.2 rating/8% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode, however, did manage to beat the Fox drama series The Finder and The CW drama series The Secret Circle. Reviews \\"Trivia\\" received relatively positive reviews, although many critics did not enjoy the Florida sub-plot. Many television critics agreed that \\"Trivia\\" was a marked improvement over many of the episodes in the first part of the season. Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, \\"Aside from a few weak moments, 'Trivia' was a solid episode of The Office and a vast improvement over most of the episodes this season.\\" Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, \\"When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I‚Äôll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative.\\" Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that \\"If you plan to continue watching The Office, here‚Äôs my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot.\\" He concluded that \\"The Office is not irreparable. It‚Äôs not great either, but there is some marked improvement here over the worst episodes from the first half of the season.\\" Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit \\"quite fun\\" and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars. The Huffington Post wrote that \\"The Office continues to find fun and unique ways to spotlight how mundane office life can be by showing ways the gang finds to fill their day.\\" Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode \\"charming.\\" IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled \\"The Quiz\\", writing that \\"while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common.\\" She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, \\"the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, and it feels good to be laughing again at The Office.\\" While a large majority of critics praised the main trivia storyline, many reviews criticized the Dwight and Robert plot. McNutt wrote that, \\"As the trivia storyline was building momentum, the Florida storyline was killing that same momentum, a push-and- pull that the trivia ended up winning.\\" Forcella explained that \\"the titular storyline of the gang playing 'Trivia' in Philadelphia worked really well, but the forced trio in Florida definitely did not.\\" Jill Mader from InsidePulse.com wrote, \\"All in all, I thought it was an inconsistent episode ‚Äì I liked the trivia storyline, but the Dwight stuff really fell flat for me.\\" References External links *\\"Trivia\\" at NBC.com  The Office (American season 8) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Trivia (The Office)"},{"id":"34200993","text":"Mullah Ehsanullah Ehsan (died late 1997) was a former member of the Taliban leadership who served as the chairman of the Taliban's Central Bank.Document 1 - Islama 01750, National Security Archive, September 11, 2004 Biography He was originally from Kandahar and belongs to the Popalzai tribe.

J. Walker. That is, it returns integer values according to some arbitrary probability distribution . The algorithms typically use or preprocessing time, after which random values can be drawn from the distribution in time. Operation Internally, the algorithm consults two tables, a probability table and an alias table (for ). To generate a random outcome, a fair di—Åe is rolled to determine an index into the two tables. Based on the probability stored at that index, a biased coin is then flipped, and the outcome of the flip is used to choose between a result of and . More concretely, the algorithm operates as follows: # Generate a uniform random variate . # Let and . (This makes uniformly distributed on and uniformly distributed on .) # If , return . This is the biased coin flip. # Otherwise, return . An alternative formulation of the probability table, proposed by Marsaglia et. al. as the ‚Äúsquare histogram‚Äù method, uses the condition in the third step (where ) instead of computing . Table generation The distribution may be padded with additional probabilities to increase to a convenient value, such as a power of two. To generate the table, first initialize . While doing this, divide the table entries into three categories: * The ‚Äúoverfull‚Äù group, where , * The ‚Äúunderfull‚Äù group, where and has not been initialized, and * The ‚Äúexactly full‚Äù group, where or has been initialized. If , the corresponding value will never be consulted and is unimportant, but a value of is sensible. As long as not all table entries are exactly full, repeat the following steps: # Arbitrarily choose an overfull entry and an underfull entry . (If one of these exists, the other must, as well.) # Allocate the unused space in entry to outcome , by setting . # Remove the allocated space from entry by changing . # Entry is now exactly full. # Assign entry to the appropriate category based on the new value of . Each iteration moves at least one entry to the ‚Äúexactly full‚Äù category (and the last moves two), so the procedure is guaranteed to terminate after at most iterations. Each iteration can be done in time, so the table can be set up in time. Vose points out that floating-point rounding errors may cause the guarantee referred to in step 1 to be violated. If one category empties before the other, the remaining entries may have set to 1 with negligible error. The Alias structure is not unique. As the lookup procedure is slightly faster if (because does not need to be consulted), one goal during table generation is to maximize the sum of the . Doing this optimally turns out to be NP hard, but a greedy algorithm comes reasonably close: rob from the richest and give to the poorest. That is, at each step choose the largest and the smallest . Because this requires sorting the , it requires time. Efficiency Although the alias method is very efficient if generating a uniform deviate is itself fast, there are cases where it is far from optimal in terms of random bit usage. This is because it uses a full- precision random variate each time, even when only a few random bits are needed. One case arises when the probabilities are particularly well balanced, so many and is not needed. Generating is a waste of time. For example if , then a 32-bit random variate could be used to make 32 choices, but the alias method will only generate one. Another case arises when the probabilities are strongly unbalanced, so many . For example if and , then the great majority of the time, only a few random bits are required to determine that case 1 applies. In such cases, the table method described by Marsaglia et al. is more efficient. If we make many choices with the same probability we can on average require much less than one unbiased random bit. Using arithmetic coding techniques arithmetic we can approach the limit given by the binary entropy function.

Scientific Contributions As a graduate student, Ingham isolated a novel homoeotic mutation in Drosophila, which he named trithorax (trx). Using genetic mosaic analysis, he showed that the trx gene is required for the maintenance of the determined state of cells, presaging the current understanding of the Trithorax-group proteins as key epigenetic regulators throughout the animal kingdom. Subsequently, he pioneered the molecular analysis of the process of segmentation in the Drosophila embryo, through the simultaneous analysis the expression of patterns of pair rule genes using the technique of in situ hybridisation. These studies led to his interest in what is now known as the Hedgehog signalling pathway; Ingham's genetic studies identified the core components of this pathway and in particular the role of the Patched protein as the receptor for the Hedgehog ligand. In 1993, in collaboration with Andy McMahon and Cliff Tabin, Ingham's research group discovered the vertebrate homologues of the Drosophila hedgehog gene, including Sonic hedgehog.Biologists Find Key Genes That Shape Patterning of Embryos ‚Äì New York Times This finding set in train a surge of interest in this pathway, leading amongst other things, to the recognition of its role in a number of human cancers and to the development of a novel anti-cancer drug that specifically targets the pathway.Pin by Cancer Research UK on Skin Cancer  Pinterest Ingham was in the vanguard of researchers to adopt the zebrafish, Danio rerio, as a model for the analysis of vertebrate development and more recently for the study of processes related to human diseases. Publications Ingham has authored or co-authored over 180 peer-reviewed scientific primary research papers and review articles.

The temple is located on the slopes of Mount Nokogiri and is known for its Nihon- ji Daibutsu. Nihon-ji was established as a Hoss≈ç sect temple, was transferred to the Tendai sect, and is now a S≈çt≈ç Zen temple. Since its founding the temple has fallen into ruin and been revived numerous times.  History   Founding  Nihon-ji was founded in the Nara period in 725 by order of Emperor Sh≈çmu by the priest Gy≈çki (668-749). The temple is considered to be the Kant≈ç region's sole Nara period , or temple built by order of the emperor. Nihon-ji was founded by Gy≈çki as a Hoss≈ç Sect temple. In this period the temple had seven great halls, twelve smaller halls, and was home to 100 monks. By tradition Nihon-ji was visited in the Nara period by R≈çben (689-774), a monk of the Kegon sect and founder of the T≈çdai-ji in Nara, and later by K≈´kai (774-835), founder of the Shingon or \\"True Word\\" school of Buddhism. In 857, by opportunity of a visit to the temple by the monk Ennin (793 or 794-864), Nihon-ji was transferred to the Tendai school of Buddhism.  Revivals and transfer to S≈çt≈ç sect  Minamoto no Yoritomo was associated with the rebuilding of Nihon-ji. In 1181, he ordered the building of the jiz≈ç statue in the lecture hall. In 1271, the area came under the control of the Nikaid≈ç clan, and Nihon-ji is mentioned as Awa no Kuni Nihon-ji in the clan history. Nihon-ji was burned during a local conflict 1331 and many of the temple structures, including the d≈çu hall, were destroyed. Ashikaga Takauji (1305-1358), founder and first sh≈çgun of the Ashikaga shogunate, rebuilt Nihon-ji. Takauji built the eaved main hall in 1345, but during the Sengoku period the temple again fell into decline. In the Tensh≈ç era (1573-1592) of the Momoyama period, Nihon-ji came under the protection of the powerful Satomi clan of Awa Province. During this period it became a subordinate temple of the Awa Seizen-in. In 1647, the temple was transferred to the S≈çt≈ç Zen sect, and Nihon-ji became a center of ascetic Zen practices. Nihon-ji came under the control of Enmei-ji, a temple in present-day Minamib≈çs≈ç. During the Sengoku period the temple again fell into ruin.  Tokugawa period revival  In 1774, the priest , the 9th chief H≈çs≈ç priest of Nihon-ji, carried out a large- scale revival of the garan, or temple complex. In 1774, Guden relocated the d≈çu temple hall, as well as many other structures of the temple, to the southern side of the middle of Mount Nokogiri. This transformed Mount Nokogiri into a sacred mountain. The Nihon-ji Daibutsu was built in this period, as well as the 1,553 rakan Arhat stone statues.  Meiji Period destruction and modern restoration  Nihon-ji suffered much destruction during the anti- Buddhist haibutsu kishaku movement (1868-c.1874) after the Meiji Restoration. Buddhist property was destroyed on a large scale throughout Japan, and many of the structures of the temple complex at Nihon-ji were destroyed. Many of the Arhat statues were beheaded in this period. In 1916, a restoration of the temple complex of Nihon-ji began. A major earthquake in November 1939, however, again damaged the temple. The chief d≈çu hall, statues, and treasured Buddhist articles were lost in a fire that occurred due to the earthquake. In 1989, the government of India presented Nihon-ji with a sapling from the Bodhi Tree as a gesture of world peace. Nihon-ji is now a popular tourist destination.

As of 2009, it is also known as the Scott Building. The five-story building is in the Renaissance Revival style, constructed of tan brick and trimmed with Lake Superior Sandstone. The building is listed as a Michigan State Historic Site and is a contributing property of the Quincy Street Historic District. History Pencil drawing of the hotel prior to the 1920s showing the four balconies Construction of the hotel was completed in August 1906. It opened on August 14, 1906, and was owned by Archibald J. Scott, for whom the building is named. In December 1913, Charles Moyer, president of the Western Federation of Miners, was in the hotel when he was attacked, shot, and later deported by train to Chicago. The Kerredge Theatre, located next door to the east, burned down late May 1959 and caused an estimated $100,000 (1959 US dollars) of smoke and water damage to the hotel. At this time, the hotel had 100 rooms. The hotel closed in the late 1960s. The building was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site on January 17, 1986. On October 13, 1988, the Quincy Street Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with the Scott Hotel as a contributing property. A 2004 study recommended that the largely unused building should be put to better use. The Hancock Hardware store, located on the ground floor, closed in 2006. Beginning in 2006, the building underwent a $4.2 million renovation to create 28 apartment units for low-income seniors. The renovation was completed and the apartments opened for occupancy in December 2007. Architecture Designed by Eric Anderson in the Renaissance Revival style, the five-story building is rectangular in shape with a flat-roof. It is largely constructed of tan-colored brick adorned with Lake Superior Sandstone trimmings and quoining. The building's stamped metal cornice is trimmed with modillions and dentils. The building was originally fronted by four stories of balconies, though by March 1921 the topmost balcony had been removed. By April 1922, the balconies had been replaced by a single veranda. About this time, a large sign displaying Scott Hotel was built on top of the building. A different sign at the same spot that read Hotel Scott existed during the 1940s and 1950s. The veranda was removed in the 1960s and the hotel signage was also removed at some point.

Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned a challenge to a civil commitment statute for sexual predators in Washington state. The petitioner tried to differentiate this case from previous ones before the Supreme Court which upheld civil commitment statutes. The Court rejected the challenge to the law over the objection of a single Justice. Background In 1990, Washington state passed the Community Protection Act of 1990 which authorized the civil commitment of \\"sexually violent predators\\", persons considered to have a \\"mental abnormality\\" that makes them likely to engage in sexually violent acts. Under this law, a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and is scheduled for release from jail or prison is instead subject to civil commitment, if found to be a \\"sexually violent predator\\". Andre Brigham Young was confined under the provisions of the Act.The other named party in the case, Dr. Mark Seling, was the superintendent of the facility where Young was committed. (Hough 2001) He challenged his commitment in state court, arguing that the conditions of his commitment were punitive and that he was, in effect, serving a second criminal sentence. After losing in his suit, he began a habeas action in federal court. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that Young's challenge to the law was allowed, even though the United States Supreme Court had decided in 1997, in Kansas v. Hendricks, that a similar Kansas law was constitutional. The Ninth Circuit distinguished the cases, saying this case challenged the law \\"as applied\\", and was specific to the potentially 'punitive' nature of the Washington law. The state appealed and the Supreme Court granted review. Opinion of the Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court, which disagreed with the Ninth Circuit as to the nature of the challenge to the Washington statute. O'Connor argued that because the Washington Supreme Court had already held the law as entirely 'civil', Young's contention that the law was 'punitive' was functionally a full \\"facial challenge\\". A facial challenge takes issue with the entire law, and such challenges had already been dismissed by the Supreme Court. O'Connor stressed that the decision \\"does not mean that respondent and others...have no remedy for the alleged conditions at the Center\\". Instead, committed persons could challenge the state of conditions in accordance with the procedures established under the Washington law. Lastly, the Court dismissed the challenge to the law as the act in question was entirely 'civil'. Scalia's concurrence Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurrence in the decision of the majority with which Justice Souter joined. He wrote simply to \\"dissociate [himself] from any implication that there is [an] open question\\" about the ex post facto and Double Jeopardy Clause challenges to the Washington law. Scalia wrote that the purely civil nature of the commitment statute blocked any Fifth Amendment challenge, which only relate to criminal laws. Thomas' concurrence Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment of the Court, but not the reasoning of the majority. His opinion rested on two primary points: first, that just because a civil statute is implemented in a 'criminal-like' manner does not change the nature of the statute; second, a 'first instance' challenge and a subsequent challenge is a distinction \\"without a difference\\". Thus, he disagreed with the concept of 'as-applied' challenges to state laws. Stevens' dissent Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a lone dissenting opinion. He argued that the detention of a person in the manner Washington state has done is not \\"necessarily civil\\". Stevens argued that the punitive nature of the detention makes the sanction criminal. Thus, he saw a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause as \\"conditions of confinement\\" were placed twice for the defendant -- once in prison and once in civil commitment. Stevens concluded by saying he would have affirmed the decision of the Ninth Circuit.

It stars Betty Compson as a destitute young woman on the verge of becoming a prostitute, who is hired by a wealthy man to woo his ne'er-do-well son away from the clutches of a gold-digger (Margaret Livingston). The plot is regarded as risqu√© enough to appear in at least one collection of pre-Code Hollywood films. Plot John Darrow as Russell Sir Gerald Courtney (Gilbert Emery) is an aristocrat whose son, Russell (John Darrow), prefers to spend his time partying with young women rather than focusing on the promising career he has in architecture. When Russell leaves one evening to revel with the gold-digging Berthine Waller (Margaret Livingston) rather than spending it dining with his father, Sir Gerald is a bit despondent. As he ponders what to do about his wayward son, providence takes a hand. A beautiful destitute young woman, June (Betty Compson), on the verge of entering into the oldest of professions due to her desperation, is being pursued by the London police. Sir Gerald, who was at the window in the first floor watching his son leaving with Berthine Waller, observes how June leaves a taxi on the other side of the street, and is being cornered by the police. As she comes over to his house to knock, he opens the door and welcomes her as a niece he was expecting, reassuring the Policemen that she is a respectable citizen. After they leave, Sir Gerald invites her to dinner, after she tells him of her situation. He then proposes to hire June for 1000 Pounds to prevent his son from falling into the clutches of Berthine. Betty Compson as June June does her job beautifully, as Russell leaves Berthine and begins to concentrate on his architectural career, much to his father‚Äôs delight. There‚Äôs a slight hitch, however: June has fallen in love with Sir Gerald, rather than Russell. Devastated, Russell calls Berthine to meet him at his apartment (which is upstairs in the same building where June lives). Seeing all of her work being unwound in a single evening, June lures Russell down to her apartment where she gets him so drunk that he passes out and spends the night. Berthine arrives at Russell‚Äôs apartment where she has been followed by an ex-lover, Nikolai Rabinoff (Ivan Lebedeff). In a jealous rage, Nikolai kills Berthine. The following morning Russell awakes to find June gone, having vowed to not come between the son and the father. Russell is also the main suspect in Berthine's murder. Seeking shelter from his father, Russell refuses to invoke June as his alibi. In order to save him, June steps forward and admits that Russell spent the night in her apartment. Sir Gerald, thinking the worst, renounces his devotion for June, which devastates her, but confirmed what she always feared: That Sir Gerald would never rely on her. June leaves his house, but when Sir Gerald, shortly thereafter, discovers the innocence of Russell‚Äôs night spent in her apartment, he realizes his own mistake and vows to track her down and spend the rest of his life with her.

History Lightwave was originally conceived as an electronic music trio consisting of Serge Leroy, Laurent Bozeck and Christian Wittman. In 1987, Lightwave was re-established as a duo comprising musicians Christoph Harbonnier and Christian Wittman. The first album by the newly formed Lightwave was released in 1990 under the title Nachtmusik for German Erdenklang. In 1993, it was the turn of Tycho Brah√© with the help of the violinist Jacques Deregnaucourt, Hector Zazou and Paul Haslinger member of Tangerine Dream. The album, dedicated to the Danish astronomer of the same name, is an innovative blend of cosmic music and ambient music. In 1995 Mundus Subterraneus, an album of what is considered their magnum opus, was published by Hearts of Space Records. The group, now a quartet, was inspired to create a guide to a journey into the bowels of Vesuvius by Athanasius Kircher, a philosopher of the seventeenth century. The album is a succession of sounds that evoke terrifying nightmares, symbolic journey into the bowels of the Earth, but represents collectively a journey in the human unconscious. The returning duo of Wittman and Harbonnier continued the work begun with the sound research of Mundus Subterraneus in subsequent albums: In Der Unterwelt (1996), consists of a single 20-minute suite, published by Plan Sonores; Cantus Umbrarum (1999), recorded within the Choranche caves in the Vercors region (France) on the occasion of Rugissants Festival of Grenoble, and Caryotype (2001) consisting of a suite in eleven movements. In 2004, the group turns to chamber music for the album Bleue Comme Une Orange. Inspired by the works of Alexander Scriabin, the group uses classical instruments to a greater extent and featured the participation of Jon Hassell. Their concerts and recordings of their records are the result of research of particular locations like the concert at the Gasometer in Oberhausen in Germany, and in the large domed observatory of Bischoffsheim Nice during the recording of the live album Uranography at M.A.N.C.A. (Musiques Actuelles Nice C√¥te d'Azur) Festival. Musical style With a jovial approach to old and new electronic stringed instruments and sound materials, Lightwave focused on exploring poetic and sensual worlds, playing with sounds as with colors, shapes, concrete objects or spatial dimensions. The duo favored mixing live electronic with acoustic instruments, performing impromptu compositions that were built on listening and sharing, similar in to a jazz trio or string quartet. Lightwave utilized analog synthesizers such as Polymoog, Oberheim and RSF Polykobol to craft their music.

For certain regular expression operators like \`\` (logical disjunction or boolean \\"or\\") it exceeds PCRE. On the other hand, RE2 does not support back-references and cannot implement those efficiently. It is also slightly slower than PCRE for parenthetic capturing operations. PCRE can use a large recursive stack with corresponding high memory use and have exponential runtime on certain patterns. In contrast, RE2 uses a fixed stack and guarantees that run-time increases linearly (not exponentially) with the size of the input. The maximum memory allocated with RE2 is configurable. RE2 has a slightly smaller set of features than PCRE, but has very predictable run-time and a maximum memory allotment. This makes it suitable for use in server applications which requiring boundaries on memory usage and computational time. PCRE, on the other hand, has almost all of the features that a regular expression library can have, but has unpredictable run-time and memory usage and can grow unbounded.

It was last was assigned to the United States Army Philippine Department at Nichols Field, Commonwealth of the Philippines. It was disbanded on 1 November 1941.4th Composite Group organizational record card, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, Alabama The Group was the primary command and control organization for all Army Air Corps units in the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1919 until the eve of World War II in November 1941. History Inter-war years The unit was formed from the World War I 2d, 3d and 28th Aero Squadrons in 1919 (its emblem represents the three squadrons with Maltese crosses). The 2d Aero Squadron, having served in the Philippines beginning in 1915, was transferred back from Rockwell Field, California in 1920 after training duties in the United States during the war. The 3d Aero Squadron, also a stateside training unit during the war, was transferred from Mitchel Field, New York in 1920. The 28th Aero Squadron, which had served in combat on the Western Front during the war, was transferred to the group in 1922. The units were re- designated as the 2d Observation Squadron, 3d Pursuit Squadron, and the 28th Bombardment Squadron, which represented the missions of the components of the group. Its mission was tactical training for coastal defense. Exercises and maneuvers with Army ground forces and Naval forces were a regular and important part of its mission. Another mission of the 4th Composite Group during the 1920s was aerial mapping of the Philippines, the topography of many of the islands were largely unknown. The aerial mapping mission was the primary mission of the 2d Observation Squadron. In the Philippines, the group largely received a wide variety of second-line aircraft over the years from the United States; Air Corps overseas units in the Philippines as well as the Panama Canal Zone were notorious for being the last units to receive the hand- me-down aircraft during the austere years of Air Corps procurement during the 1920s and 1930s. Beginning in 1934, the Philippine Constabulary Air Corps (PCAC) was created. The Philippine department of the US Army lent the Commonwealth government the services of men from the 4th Composite Group to train the officers and personnel of the budding Air Corps, making it one of the earliest independent Air Forces in Asia. Prelude to War In 1940, political relations between the United States and the Japanese Empire reached a crisis with the Japanese occupation of French Indochina. With war clouds forming, a reinforcement effort was made to the Air Corps units in the Philippines. On or about 1 November 1940, the 4th was reinforced by the 17th Pursuit Squadron from the 1st Pursuit Group, being transferred from Selfridge Field, Michigan. The 20th Pursuit Squadron, from the 35th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field, California also was transferred. Both of these squadrons, however, had only sent their personnel and both were equipped in the Philippines with the obsolete Boeing P-26 Peashooter. AFHRA Document 00078307 24th Pursuit Group In May 1941, the 3d, 17th and 20th squadrons were re- equipped with Seversky P-35As that were manufactured for the Swedish Air Force. On 24 October 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order requisitioning all the undelivered P-35s sold to Sweden and impressing them into the USAAC. 40 of the planes arrived at the Manila Air Depot in Swedish markings, with Swedish language technical orders and Swedish marked instrumentation. These planes all required modification at the depot before being turned over to the squadrons for operational use.Baugher, Seversky P-35A The 28th Bombardment Squadron also received some Douglas B-18 Bolos. During the summer of 1941, Nichols Field was undergoing construction of an east-west runway, making the north-south runway unusable due to a lack of drainage. The 4th was forced to move all of its squadrons to Clark Field with the exception of the 17th Pursuit Squadron. The 17th was sent to Iba Airfield on the north coast of Luzon where it was undergoing gunnery training. In July, the 20th Pursuit Squadron was upgraded to the P-40B Warhawk. At the same time, about 100 new pilots out of training school at Randolph Field arrived. A training unit was set up to provide transition training for the new pilots into pursuit aircraft. In September, the 17th was moved to the still uncompleted Nichols Field when word was received that space at Clark was needed for B-17 Flying Fortresses of the incoming 19th Bombardment Group. The 3d Squadron was sent up to Iba for gunnery training to free up the space. However the 17th suffered from the ongoing construction at Nichols, which caused several ground accidents. With the large number of units being deployed to the Philippines during the buildup of forces in the summer and fall of 1941, the 3d, 17th and 20th Squadrons were reassigned to the new 24th Pursuit Group, which was activated at Clark Field. The 28th Bombardment Squadron was transferred to the newly arriving 19th Bombardment Group. With its tactical squadrons transferred, the organization was no longer needed and the 2d Observation Squadron was assigned directly to Far East Air Force Headquarters. Subsequently, the 4th Composite Group was disbanded.Edmonds, Walter D.

The command was officially established on 6 May 1941 as the Philippine Department Air Force at Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippines. Origins The United States Army Philippine Department was established on 11 January 1911 in the Unincorporated Philippine Territory. Fifth Air Force traces its roots in the Philippines to the activation of the Air Office of the Philippine Department in March 1912.The Army Almanac (1950) In August 1907, Brigadier General James Allen, the United States Army's Chief Signal Officer, established the Aeronautical Division as the nation's air service and oversaw the introduction of powered heavier-than-air flight as a military application. Four years later Allen recommended the establishment of an air station in the Philippines. Military aviation began there on 12 March 1912,Civil aviation preceded military in the Philippines by more than a year. Three Americans, airplane designers Thomas Scott Baldwin and Tod Shriver, and barnstormer James C. \\"Bud\\" Mars, visited the Philippines in early 1911 as part of a 30,000-mile world demonstration tour. Their aircraft were the Skylark, Shriver's 1910 biplane, flown by Mars, and the Red Devil, designed and flown by Baldwin. Both planes had been built by Glenn Curtiss. Baldwin made the first cross-country flight in the Philippines in the Red Devil in February 1911, and sold it to an American resident of the Philippines, who later crashed it. when 1st Lt. Frank P. Lahm of the 7th Cavalry, detailed to the Division, opened the Philippine Air School on the polo field of Fort William McKinley, using a single Wright B airplane to train pilots. Ultimately attriting four of the Army's first 18 airplanes, aviation went temporarily out of business when the last plane crashed into Corregidor's San Jose Bay on 12 January 1915. The First Company, 2d Aero Squadron, was activated at Fort William McKinley, Luzon, on 3 February 1916. This unit was a training school, operating Martin S Hydro seaplanes, first produced in the United States in 1915. The unit operated under the Air Office until 15 October 1917, when it was inactivated when the early aviators returned to the United States as a result of the American entry into World War I. In 1917 outside Fort Stotsenburg, Luzon, construction began on a half-mile long dirt runway, hangars and other support facilities to bring the local army units into the air age. Construction was completed in 1919. A permanent Army Air Service presence in the Philippines began in December 1919 with the activation of the 3d Aero Squadron at the facility. The unit was initially equipped with de Havilland DH-4 medium bombers. The next year it moved to the new Clark Field on 15 October 1920 where, combined with some support units, the 1st Observation Group was formed. Clark Field became the Army Air Corps headquarters overseas, and was the only American air base west of Hawaii. In 1923 the Air Service withdrew all of the DH-4s, along with Liberty motors and spare parts, previously sent to the Philippines to be stored as a reserve, came back to the United States for conversion to DH-4Bs. When workmen at Rockwell Field outside San Diego, California opened one of the crates, they found a motor with a remarkable history. Built in Detroit, it went to France, back to the United States, then to the Philippines, and now to Rockwell- without ever being used.  4th Composite Group  In 1922, a second unit, the 28th Bombardment Squadron, was activated at Clark Field with DH-4s. in 1923, the 3d Aero Squadron was re designated the 3d Pursuit Squadron and received new Boeing Thomas-Morse MB-3 fighters. With that, the 1st Observation Group at Clark was re-designated as the 4th Observation; and later the 4th Composite Group. The 4th Composite would be the mainstay of United States air power in the Philippines until 1941, under the nominal command of the Air Officer of the Philippine Department. In addition to Clark Field, additional airfields at Kindley Field on Corregidor in Manila Bay (Opened September 1922), and one at Camp Nichols (Nichols Field, 1920) were constructed. The 3d Pursuit and 28th Bombardment moved from field to field during the 1920s, with the 4th Composite Group having its headquarters at Nichols until World War II. Over time, various aircraft were sent to the Philippines, the Martin NBS-1 night bomber in 1924 (28th BS); Boeing PW-9 fighters in 1926 (3d PS); Keystone LB-5 bombers in 1929 (28th BS). Beginning in 1930, the 3d Pursuit Squadron received Boeing P-12E fighters; the 28th Bombardment Squadron, receiving Keystone B-3A bombers in 1931. The 3d Pursuit squadron also received some Douglas O-2 and Thomas-Morse O-19 observation aircraft. These would be the last new aircraft received in the Philippines until 1937 due to funding shortages caused by the Great Depression. In 1935, the Philippine Army Air Corps was established as part of the gradual decision by the United States to establish the Philippines as an independent nation. Its Army counterpart, the Philippine Scouts, had been established in 1901. In 1937, the 4th Composite Group began receiving Boeing P-26 Peashooter fighters and Martin B-10 bombers, its older aircraft being transferred to the Philippine AAC. By 1940, the corps had around 40 aircraft and 100 pilots. In 1940 as part of the overall mobilization of the Army Air Forces and in response to the increase of tensions between the United States and the Japanese Empire, two additional pursuit squadrons were transferred from the United States to the 4th Composite Group at Nichols Field: * 20th Pursuit Squadron, 18 November 1940 (Seversky P-35) * 17th Pursuit Squadron, 5 December 1940 (Seversky P-35) In addition, additional obsolete Boeing P-26 Peashooters were sent from the United States. In January 1941, however, the three pursuit squadrons began receiving a few Seversky P-35As. These little Severskys had originally been consigned to Sweden, but on last-minute orders from Washington the shipment was diverted to the Philippines. Because the plane had been designed for the Swedish Air Force they were considerably more powerfully armed than the U.S. model, which carried only two .30-caliber machine guns firing through the propeller. Before this, their standard equipment had been obsolete Boeing P-26 Peashooters. The pilots of the 17th and 20th Squadrons, arriving from the States in November 1940, had been surprised, to put it mildly, when they found themselves back in the obsolete type of plane from which they had graduated a year before at Selfridge Field, Michigan. In fact, when they scratched the paint off a few of these antique numbers, they found some of the identical aircraft that they had trained in back in the States.Edmonds, Walter D. 1951, They Fought With What They Had: The Story of the Army Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific, 1941‚Äì1942, Office of Air Force History (Zenger Pub June 1982 reprint), :\\"In spite of suggestions by radical Air Force officers, no guns were installed in the wings of our planes; but the Swedes, being practical fellows, had ordered an extra .50-caliber gun in each wing. Some difficulties occurred in assembling the planes and in pilots' transition to them, for they were naturally equipped with Swedish instrumentation and no English version of technical orders was available. However, by the end of May the transition had been successfully accomplished and the 3d, 17th and 20th pursuit squadrons were equipped, if not with actual first-line planes, at least with machines that did not threaten to come apart in the fliers' hands.\\"  Philippine Department Air Force  The Philippine Department Air Force was formed on 6 May 1941AFHRA's fact sheet for the Fifth Air Force gives the date, in error, as 20 September 1941. Craven and Cate's date (cited from the monograph AAF Reference History No. 11, \\"Army Air Action in the Philippines and Netherlands East Indies, 1941-42\\", p.6-10 and reissued as AAF Historical Study No. 34) of 6 May coincides with the assignment of a general officer to command the PDAF. 20 September 1941 is possibly the date that the Army endorsed the Philippine Department's general order organizing the PDAF. Whatever the source of AFHRA's error, by 20 September its name had already been changed to \\"Air Force, USSAFFE\\" for a month. (Williams p. 5) as the War Department hastily reversed course and attempted to upgrade its air defenses in the Philippines. The general officer requested by Grunert arrived on May 4 in the person of Brig. Gen. Henry B. Clagett , who had just completed a three-week air defense course taught at Mitchel Field, New York, to familiarize him with the concepts of integrating Signal Corps radars, radio communications, and interceptor forces.The general was known in the service as \\"Sue\\" Clagett. A West Point graduate in the class ahead of Chief of Air Corps Major General Henry H. Arnold, he had been a career infantry officer until switching to the Air Service in mid-career during World War I. He had never served in nor commanded troops in combat. Clagett had succeeded Arnold in command of the GHQ Air Force 1st Wing in 1936 after holding a number of Air Corps Training Center commands, which led to his promotion to brigadier general in a wave of Air Corps expansion promotions in October 1940. When selected to command the new PDAF he had been wing commander of the newly-created 6th Pursuit Wing less than three months. His selection by the War Department had come at a time when Arnold was in the dog house with President Roosevelt for vociferously criticizing foreign sales of aircraft at the expense of the Air Corps and in England, struggling to keep from being involuntarily retired. Edmunds described Clagett as \\"an old-line officer of uncertain health, with a long record of peacetime service and a prodigious knowledge of regulations, which had induced conservative habits of thought and a certain inflexibility of imagination.\\" (Edmunds, p. 19) His poor health, reputation for drinking and possibly his selection by the War Department without input from Arnold ultimately contributed to the AAF chief relieving him from command after just five months. (Miller) Marshall had also given Clagett a top-secret mission to go to China in mid-May for a month of observation and assessment of Japanese tactics. On 27 July 1941, General Douglas MacArthur, who had been recalled to active duty, was placed in command of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). For the Air Forces the new command involved further shifts in organization, and on 5 August the Philippine Department which had controlled air units since March 1912 was redesignated Air Forces, USAFFE.  Operating squadrons and reinforcements  In the meantime, though, the squadrons suffered from a shortage of pilots. The 17th and 20th Pursuit Squadrons, which had arrived with a full complement, were continually losing men through transfers to other organizations more seriously understaffed. Pilot reinforcements began to come in February, but not until July were the three pursuit squadrons brought back to strength, when pilots fresh out of training school landed at Manila. As these men all required further training, a unit for that purpose had to be set up at Clark Field. By then the 17th and 20th had lost about 75 percent of their original personnel, and ultimately the 17th went into the war with only five of the pilots who had come out with the unit and 35 younger pilots who had received their training in the Philippines for periods varying from one to ten months. Throughout the second half of 1941, additional units were deployed to the Philippines, reinforcing the Philippine Department Air Force. These reinforcements aimed to deter Japanese aggression. They were sent in response to the proposal by Chief of the Army Air Forces, Major General Henry H. Arnold, who in July 1941 proposed sending four heavy bombardment groups (340 aircraft) and two pursuit squadrons (260 aircraft) to the Philippines.Edmonds, Walter D. 1951, They Fought With What They Had: The Story of the Army Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific, 1941‚Äì1942, Office of Air Force History (Zenger Pub June 1982 reprint), An increasing stream of reinforcements now began to arrive from the United States. By October, it had become necessary to move one of the fighter squadrons out of Clark Field to make room for the expected arrival of the 19th Bombardment Group. The 17th Pursuit Squadron was therefore transferred to its old base at Nichols Field, and shortly afterward, on 26 October, the 3d Pursuit Squadron took its place at the new Iba Airfield and began gunnery training. Work on the landing strips at Nichols Field had not been completed, and their poor condition resulted in a high accident rate for the 17th Squadron. However, these two squadrons, and the 20th, which stayed at Clark Field, had now finally reached the fields on which they were still based when the news of the Pearl Harbor Attack came, near dawn of 8 December. With the arrival of the 19th Bombardment Group, the 4th Composite Group would become an unwieldy organization. On 26 September, therefore, the 24th Pursuit Group was created, including the three squadrons, now at the three separate fields, as well as Headquarters and a Headquarters Squadron, which were based at Clark Field. On 16 November 1941, the 19th Bombardment Group arrived from the United States at Clark Field and the 4th Composite group was disbanded. On 20 November, two more squadrons, the 21st Pursuit Squadron and the 34th Pursuit Squadron, both from the 35th Pursuit Group, arrived from the States and were attached to the 24th Pursuit Group pending the arrival of the rest of the 35th group, which of course never came. These two squadrons were at only half strength. They also arrived without their planes, for they expected to find new ships ready when they disembarked from San Francisco.  Airfields  The Manila civilian Nielson Airport was taken over in October 1941 and became Nielson Field, giving the Air Force a third operational airfield on Luzon. Additional fields were constructed at Iba, Ternate, and Del Monte on Mindanao. Clark Field, 60 miles north of Manila, was the only first-class field‚Äîit was, as a matter of fact, the only first-class field in the Philippines, for Del Monte had not yet been developed. Del Monte had no hard runways, but was entirely surfaced with turf. Nielson Field, at which the Air Headquarters was to be located, lay just south of Manila, between the city and Fort McKinley. It was classed as a fighter field, but had few facilities and was little used by combat planes then or later. Iba Field, on the Zambales coast well north of Subic Bay, had been a training camp for the Philippine Constabulary. It was to be used for a few short months by the Air Force as a gunnery training field, but it lacked facilities for extended operations. This left Nichols Field as the principal fighter field. It was about six miles south of the heart of Manila and near the shore of Manila Bay, from which it was divided by the constricted, ramshackle barrio of Baclaran and a curve of the Para√±aque River. The only approach to the field was down the main road that doubled as Baclaran's village street and then sharp left along a narrow lane that crossed the Para√±aque River on a flimsy two-lane bridge.

A rare example of American influence in Danish architecture, the building now serves as an exhibition space. History Munkeruphus was built in 1916 for civil engineer Frederik Raaschou and his family by the two young architects Terkel Hjejle and Niels Rosenkj√¶r. In 1958 it was acquired by artist and designer Gunnar Aagaard Andersen and his wife. Aagaard had previously lived in France from 1946 to 1951 where he had co-founded Groupe Espace, a collaborative between artists and architects who worked with spatial art, and he made it the centre of an active artistic environment with many visiting colegees visiting from abroad. In 1986 it was purchased by the Capital Region Authority and subsequently listed by the Danish Heritage Agency. For a few years it was left empty but in the autumn of 1988 it was ceded to a foundation with the aim of transforming it into an exhibition space for changing exhibitions. It was renovated with support from private benefactors and opened the doors to its first exhibition on 26 August 1989. Architecture The house viewed from the west Munkeruphus was designed with inspiration from the Arts and Crafts Movement and American Colonial Revival architecture. It is a two-story, T-shaped structure with a horizontal board siding, topped by a shingled hip roof. The almost symmetrical main facade is nine bays long but the second window from each side and on both floors is omitted, save in the ground floor of the left hand side where a smaller window creates a small deviation from the dominating symmetry of the facade. The main entrance is through a double-leafed French door with a glass transom. On the north (rear) side, another wing has been designed to optimize views of the sea. Park The house viewed from the garden Set back from the coastal road between Hornb√¶k and Gilleleje, at the end of an unpaved driveway, the house is on a 16-hectare lot which consists of parkland with lawns, winding paths and many mature trees. The rear slopes reach all the way to the sandy beaches along the √òresund and the park affords views of Nakkehoved and Hornb√¶k along the coast as well as Sweden on the other side of the water. There are also a number of outdoor sculptures on the premises. Munkeruphus today Munkeruphus is operated as a self-owning institution. It plays host to 5-6 exhibitions a year about art, crafts, design, architecture or other themes. It also serves as a venue for lectures and indoor as well as outdoor concerts. There is also a caf√© which serves light lunch meals, cakes and hot and cold drinks in the ground floor of the rear wing.

It is closely allied to N. truncata and was once considered a dark, highland form of this species.Mey, F.S. 2011. Nepenthes robcantleyi aka \\"Nepenthes black truncata\\". Strange Fruits: A Garden's Chronicle, December 27, 2011. Nepenthes veitchii from Borneo is also thought to be a close relative. The pitchers of N. robcantleyi are exceptionally large, reaching 40 cm in length by 10 cm in width. The inflorescence, at up to 2.5 m long, is the tallest among known Nepenthes species.Smith, L. 2011. The award-winning plant that dines on rats and reptiles. The Independent, December 26, 2011. The plant itself does not grow very tall, however, and is not known to climb. The specific epithet robcantleyi honours Robert Cantley, who was involved in the plant's discovery, propagation, and introduction to cultivation.McPherson, S.R. 2011. Discovery of Nepenthes robcantleyi. In: New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 452‚Äì457. Botanical history Discovery Nepenthes robcantleyi was discovered by Robert Cantley in January 1997, on a remote mountain on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Cantley was exploring the site in search of N. truncata seeds for his recently established plant nursery, Borneo Exotics. The site lay within a logging concession and Cantley was accompanied by the head of security for the company with the logging rights to the area. Near the top of a small hill Cantley found a number of typical N. truncata plants as well as two mature individuals of a striking, previously unknown taxon. Though bearing very dark pitchers with well-developed wings and a wide, flared peristome, the plants closely matched N. truncata in leaf morphology and were at the time assumed to represent a robust highland variant of this species. One of these plants bore a mature infructescence that had already dispersed \\"nearly all\\" of its seeds. Cantley collected the few remaining seeds from this plant. The darker of the two plants‚Äîwhich later became known as the \\"black N. truncata\\" on account of its almost completely black pitchers‚Äîwas growing in full sun and measured around 1.5 m in diameter, being \\"not yet mature\\". The original population discovered by Cantley is now thought to be extinct, as the area was cleared shortly after Cantley's visit (in 1997) and two trips in the subsequent two years failed to find any surviving plants. Nepenthes robcantleyi plants (foreground) at the Borneo Exotics display for the 2011 Chelsea Flower Show Horticultural interest The seeds collected by Cantley were successfully germinated in cultivation. The resulting plants closely matched the two individuals seen in the wild in both their morphology and dark pigmentation (though they exhibited some variation in peristome colour). Initially thought to represent an extreme variant of N. truncata, they were presented as such on the Borneo Exotics website.Nepenthes truncata. Borneo Exotics. [archived page from 6 October 2008] Martin Cheek's describing paper states that only 9 plants were raised from the original batch of seeds. Cantley subsequently clarified that there were in fact 11 plants: 4 were sent to a grower in the United States (Tony Paroubek),Cantley, R. 2012. Nepenthes robcantleyi: Tony Paroubek's Clones .

In total around 3000 seedlings were produced. They became available commercially in late 2009. Nepenthes robcantleyi, and particularly the 'Queen of Hearts' plant, has featured prominently in the company's Gold Medal-winning Chelsea Flower Show displays.Fernando, H. 2007.

It has also appeared at other shows, including the Singapore Garden Festival in 2008. The species is reported to be an easy grower and to do well in typical Nepenthes highland conditions, with warm days up to 25 ¬∞C, cool nights down to 12 ¬∞C, and high light levels. Providing adequate conditions are maintained, a pitcher-to-leaf size ratio greater than 1 can be achieved in cultivation. A number of horticultural hybrids involving N. robcantleyi have been produced.2012 Nepenthes Roundup. Borneo Exotics. [Anonymous] 2013. New & returning items - summary.

Formal description Nepenthes robcantleyi was formally described by Kew botanist Martin Cheek in the Nordic Journal of Botany. An independently paginated preprint of the type description was distributed on 2 December 2011, but the journal number in which it appeared was only issued on 6 January 2012 (though dated \\"2011\\"). For the purposes of priority the year of valid publication is recorded as 2011. The specific epithet robcantleyi was chosen to honour Robert Cantley. The shorter epithet cantleyi (also referring to Robert Cantley) had previously been applied to a natural hybrid between N. bicalcarata and N. gracilis (N. √ó cantleyi). Though this name has never been validly published (it is a nomen nudum)Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes cantleyi. Carnivorous Plant Database. and was therefore available for describing a new species, Cheek chose robcantleyi instead to avoid confusion between the two. The herbarium specimen Cheek 15877 is the designated holotype and is deposited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K) in London, England. An isotype is held at the Philippine National Herbarium (PNH) in Manila, the Philippines. Cheek 15877 was prepared on 15 June 2010, and originates from cultivated material that was grown from wild seed originally collected by Cantley in 1997.Nepenthes robcantleyi Cheek. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). This herbarium material was prepared from the 'Queen of Hearts' plant, which was supplied by Cantley. Cantley also supplied Cheek with closeup photographs of the other mature specimens in his possession, and a photographic record from January 1997 (showing the original wild plants) is deposited alongside the herbarium material. Possible rediscovery Wild plants resembling N. robcantleyi were found by Andy Smith and colleagues in 2011, but due to their epiphytic habit they could only be photographed at a distance.Smith, A. 2011.

Smith managed to relocate the plants in 2013, and this time he was able to examine them more closely, showing that they were morphologically similar to N. robcantleyi and possibly conspecific with it.Mey, F.S. 2013. Looking for Nepenthes robcantleyi in Mindanao, Philippines. Strange Fruits: A Garden's Chronicle, September 13, 2013.

Carnivorous Plants in the tropics, July 14, 2014. Description Nepenthes robcantleyi is a shrub growing to a height of 0.5‚Äì1 m; no climbing specimens have been recorded. The stem is terete and reaches around 2 cm in diameter in mature plants, with internodes 1.5‚Äì2.5 cm long. The short internodal length means that each leaf base forms a slight sheath around the one immediately above it. Axillary buds are inconspicuous. Leaves Leaves are thick and robust, with a coriaceous (leathery) texture, and possess a distinct petiole. Laminae (leaf blades) borne on short stems are oblong-elliptic and measure up to 28.5 by 26.5 cm. The laminar apex is both truncate and acuminate, the acumen continuing for 2‚Äì3 cm down the tendril and being similarly wide. The tendril attachment is not peltate. The laminar base is cordate with a sinus 2.1‚Äì3.2 cm deep. The petiole is highly pronounced and very long, reaching 23 cm in length. It varies in width from 0.8‚Äì1.0 cm near the lamina to 2 cm in its basal portion. It is canaliculate with wings that fold over the adaxial channel; this gives the petiole its terete appearance. The base of the petiole forms a sheath that surrounds the stem for three-fifths of its circumference and 3‚Äì5 cm of its length. Two to four prominent longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are inconspicuous. Tendrils are thick (‚â§7 mm in diameter) and uncoiled, even when produced on higher parts of the stem. Pitchers Two of the original N. robcantleyi plants raised by Cantley, on display at the 2011 Chelsea Flower Show True rosette or lower pitchers are only produced for a brief period before the plant begins developing mature traps (termed intermediate pitchers in the type description). These mature pitchers can be very large: up to 33.0 cm high by 9.5 cm wide. They are broadly cylindrical throughout, being widest near the base (‚â§9 cm) and narrowing slightly below the peristome (‚â§8.5 cm). A pair of wings around 10 mm wide runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. These wings bear filiform fringe elements 10‚Äì12 mm long, spaced 3‚Äì4 mm apart. The pitcher mouth is obcordate in shape and has a more-or-less oblique insertion, being horizontal at the front, rising slightly by 1 cm (rarely up to 3 cm) in the central portion, and rising abruptly at the rear to form a tall neck that curves forward, giving the mouth a concave appearance when viewed from the side. The top of the neck stands around 12 cm above the front of the mouth. The peristome of this species is very well developed and showy. It is gently curved in cross section and has a somewhat wavy outer margin. The peristome may be flattened (as in the 'Queen of Hearts' plant) but is often folded back in mature pitchers. It varies in width from approximately 2 cm at the front, up to 5 cm in the central portion, and expanding to 6‚Äì9 cm or even 10 cm at the rear, making it one of the broadest in the genus. The neck extends for around 4 cm beyond this expanded portion of the peristome. The peristome bears ribs 1.0‚Äì1.5 mm high, spaced around 1.5 mm apart. These terminate in teeth on the peristome's inner margin. The teeth are generally 3‚Äì4 mm long, with those of the central seam being slightly smaller ( 2 mm long) and splayed forward at an angle of around 45¬∞. The pitcher lid or operculum is broadly ovate to suborbicular and up to around 9.5 cm in both width and length. It is held more-or-less horizontally on a cylindrical stipe measuring around 5 mm by 3 mm. It has a rounded apex and a base that is first shallowly and then abruptly cordate, with a sinus 2 cm wide and 5‚Äì8 mm deep. A prominent basal appendage is present on the underside of the lid. It is laterally-flattened, approximately semicircular, and around 13 mm long by 4 mm high. It emanates from a keel (3‚Äì5 mm high) that runs along the midline of the lower lid surface for around 2.5 cm. This keel continues as a \\"raised midrib\\" and ends in a second appendage around 7 mm from the lid apex. This apical appendage is cylindrical and much smaller than the basal projection, measuring around 3 mm in width by around 2 mm in height. The larger basal appendage is set within a concavity that appears as a bulge on the upper surface of the lid. This ovate boss is around 4 cm by 3 cm and rises up to 1 cm above the rest of the lid. Strengthened by the underlying keel, it forms a rather rigid structure. Its concave lower surface houses a dense concentration of larger nectar glands, which are otherwise absent from the lid. Those glands within 5 mm of the basal appendage are domed, orbicular, and 0.15 mm in diameter. Those occupying the remainder of the boss are transversely elliptic and 0.5 mm by 0.3 mm wide. The area of the lower lid surface outside the boss also bears glands, but these are much smaller (~0.05 mm in diameter) and sparsely distributed. They have the appearance of \\"red depressed globose glands\\". A well-developed spur is inserted near the base of the lid. It is entire (smooth and unbranched) and stout, with a truncate-concave apex. It measures up to 12 mm in length, with a diameter of up to 1.5 mm. True upper pitchers‚Äîthose having coiled tendrils and lacking fringed wings‚Äîare apparently not produced by this species. Inflorescence Nepenthes robcantleyi has a racemose inflorescence bearing two-flowered partial peduncles. The male inflorescence of N. robcantleyi is the tallest among known Nepenthes species and possibly among all carnivorous plants. It measures up to 2.13 m in length, of which the peduncle constitutes up to 97 cm. The rachis bears 100‚Äì130 two-flowered partial peduncles, spaced 6‚Äì8 mm (rarely as little as 0 mm) apart. The partial peduncles lack bracts and have a basal length of 5‚Äì12 mm, before forking into a pair of pedicels 30‚Äì36 mm long. Tepals are elliptic and measure 4‚Äì6 mm by 3‚Äì4 mm. The androphore is 5‚Äì6 mm long and terminates in a bright yellow anther head measuring 1‚Äì2 mm by 2‚Äì3 mm. As in many species, the male flowers undergo a colour change associated with anthesis; tepals are initially green with a red base, turning purple with age, whereas the androphore changes from dull red to bright red during the same period. The female inflorescence is somewhat shorter, though still very large at up to 140 cm long. As in male plants, the peduncle is up to 97 cm long. Flowers are far more sparsely distributed, with only around 35 partial peduncles per inflorescence. The partial peduncles are two-flowered and usually spaced 17‚Äì55 mm apart, but sometimes they may be very close or even touching. They are 19‚Äì28 mm long with pedicels 20‚Äì33 mm long. The partial peduncles bear basal bracts inserted 4‚Äì10 mm above the attachment point to the rachis. These bracts are filiform-linear, patent-reflexed, and 4‚Äì6 mm long, becoming longer towards the base of the inflorescence. Tepals are oblong-elliptic, patent-reflexed, and, unlike those of male flowers, are a dull pale green. They measure 6‚Äì8 mm by 3‚Äì4 mm and become elongated with age. The ovary is ellipsoidal and measures around 3 mm by 9 mm. Mature fruits and seeds were not included in the type description as they had not been seen by the author. Indumentum Nepenthes robcantleyi bears a variable indumentum of short, reddish-brown, dendritic hairs around 0.5 mm long. These are sparsely distributed on the lower surface of the lamina and upper part of the pitcher, and very sparsely on the inflorescence, but form a dense covering on developing leaves. Colouration The pitcher body is a rich reddish-brown to almost black, sometimes with green wings. The peristome is similarly dark, usually a uniform reddish-brown or black except for the pale green inner margin. The upper surface of the lid also ranges from dark red to black. The underside of the lid is pale green along the midline and near the basal appendage, and bright green to dark red towards the margins. The pitcher interior, as seen through the mouth, is bright green with purple blotches. The pitchers of this species generally have a glossy appearance. Distribution and habitat Nepenthes robcantleyi is known with certainty only from the single location in Mindanao, the Philippines, where it was observed in 1997. This location has not been disclosed for conservation reasons. The plants originally observed by Cantley grew at an altitude of around 1800 m above sea level in \\"submontane evergreen forest\\". Though these plants grew terrestrially, the species is also likely to occur as an epiphyte, like its close relative N. truncata. The plants found by Andy Smith and Wally Suarez, which may be conspecific with N. robcantleyi, also grew epiphytically. The plants observed in 1997 were sympatric with an \\"unusual and giant form\\" of N. alata sensu lato. In the type description Martin Cheek informally assessed the conservation status of N. robcantleyi as Critically Endangered based on the IUCN criteria, while noting that the species may already be extinct in the wild. Related species On account of its vegetative and floral features‚Äîspecifically the racemose inflorescence, pronounced petioles, flattened and expanded peristome, and basal and apical lid appendages‚ÄîN. robcantleyi is placed in the infrageneric Regiae, a group introduced by B. H. Danser in his 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\".Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. This group reaches its greatest diversity on the island of Borneo, where around 12 species are currently recognised. Nepenthes robcantleyi and N. truncata are the only Regiae species known from the Philippines. Nepenthes truncata Nepenthes robcantleyi shows close affinities to N. truncata, from which it differs in several aspects of pitcher morphology. Nepenthes robcantleyi retains fringed wings in its mature (largest) pitchers, while in N. truncata these are reduced to fringe-less ridges around 1 mm wide. The peristome is another distinguishing feature: in N. robcantleyi it is variably flattened and 6 to even 10 cm wide at the rear, compared to only 2 cm in N. truncata, whose peristome is rounded and semi-circular in section. The peristome ribs of N. robcantleyi are described as \\"wing-like\\" in section and reach a much greater level of development than in N. truncata: they are 1‚Äì1.5 mm high and spaced 1‚Äì2 mm apart. The far less conspicuous ribs of N. truncata (which are cylindric in section) lie closely packed together, with no obvious separation between each rib. Nepenthes veitchii In describing N. robcantleyi, Martin Cheek considered it to be closer to N. veitchii of Borneo, writing: \\"Many of the characters that separate N. robcantleyi from N. truncata are those that have defined N. veitchii.\\" He distinguished these two species on the basis of pitcher morphology and indumentum development. In N. robcantleyi the shape of the pitcher lid ranges from broadly ovate to suborbicular, compared to oblong in N. veitchii. The basal lid appendage is more pronounced in N. robcantleyi, always being clearly distinguishable from the keel. It also differs in shape, being semi-circular instead of slightly convex. Whereas in N. robcantleyi the nectar glands of the lower lid surface are densely concentrated around the basal appendage and largely absent from other parts, those of N. veitchii are sparsely distributed over the entire lid underside. In N. robcantleyi the upper surface of the lid is also distinct in that it bears an ovate boss measuring around 4 cm by 3 cm; this structure is not found in N. veitchii. Perhaps the most obvious means of distinguishing between the two species lies in the hairs covering their vegetative parts. Nepenthes robcantleyi is for the most part glabrous, having a glossy appearance. Nepenthes veitchii, in contrast, is one of the most conspicuously hairy of all Nepenthes species, with all parts bearing an indumentum of mostly simple (unbranched), patent (unobstructed), copper-coloured hairs 3‚Äì4 mm long. Pitchers of three colour variants of the Bornean endemic N. veitchii Possible hybrid origin Atypical colour forms of N. truncata, such as this specimen with an unusually dark peristome, fall within the natural variation of this species Given the small number of specimens originally observed by Cantley, there has been some speculation that N. robcantleyi may represent an F1 natural hybrid.Mey, F.S. 2014. A casual observation of cultivated Nepenthes robcantleyi. Strange Fruits: A Garden's Chronicle, July 13, 2014. Martin Cheek considered this possibility in the type description, and while accepting N. truncata as a possible parent species, he concluded that no other known Philippine species could account for the combination of characters seen in N. robcantleyi. Nepenthes veitchii, a Borneo endemic, was discounted as a possible parent since N. robcantleyi shows no evidence of the conspicuous indumentum of that species, not even in a reduced state. Moreover, N. robcantleyi exhibits a number of characters not seen in either N. truncata or N. veitchii, namely a basally domed lid, its associated concentration of nectar glands, and bracts on the partial peduncles. Cheek speculated that N. robcantleyi might have evolved from a plant similar to N. veitchii that had spread to Mindanao by long-distance dispersal from Borneo and there acquired its present suite of characters. Natural hybrids No natural hybrids involving N. robcantleyi have been recorded with certainty. However, one of the original batch of 11 seed-grown plants (one of the four that were sent to Tony Paroubek in the US) produced pitchers roughly intermediate in appearance between those of N. robcantleyi and N. truncata. Since these species were sympatric at the site where the seeds were collected, it has been suggested that this cultivated specimen may have represented a natural cross between them. This plant, which Paroubek called \\"clone C\\", was prone to producing deformed and slightly variegated leaves and eventually died.Paroubek, T. 2012. Re: black truncata: a new species?

The company has been in business since 1988. Over the years the company has grown but in 2012 it has been restructuring its business by selling off divisions and now solely focused on managed print business and print solutions. Significant Events In 2007 CSG listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and expanded into the IT Services market. A year later the company acquired the Commander Managed Services business in the ACT and won the Northern Territory Government contract to supply desktop and server management throughout the Territory. The business also expanded its print services business in regional Queensland. CSG also acquired Change Corporation Ltd in 2007 and entered in the IT consulting and integration services market for AUS $20 million. Seeking to have a national footprint, CSG terminated its relationship with Fuji Xerox in favour of Canon but was subsequently required to give existing customers the option of remaining with CSG, or novating to Fuji Xerox A year later, CSG acquired the exclusive distributorship of Konica Minolta Business Solutions in New Zealand as the majority shareholders as well as acquiring the largest dealership of Canon devices in Australia. In October 2011, an unexpected takeover offer was received by the CSG board. Shortly thereafter, the company reported that other bidders had emerged. However, in December CSG announced that it was withdrawing from the process in the best interest of shareholders In 2012, company founder, Denis Mackenzie retired from CSG and the Executive General Manager of the Technology Solutions business, Julie-Ann Kerin was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director. In July, CSG sold the Technology Solutions business to NEC Australia for a consideration of $227.5 million resulting in a profit on the sale of $92.2 million. Net proceeds from the sale after capital gains tax and other transaction related costs totalled $187.0 million. Subsequently, CSG undertook an extensive business restructure to stabilise the remaining print business and position it for future growth. CSG now employs approximately 600 staff.

She was sheathed in copper in 1810 and partially resheathed with copper in 1812. She made one voyage transporting convicts from Ireland to New South Wales, and on her return voyage to Britain she carried a cargo from China for the British East India Company (EIC). She was wrecked in 1816 while carrying troops from Quebec to Nova Scotia. Career Her first master was a Captain Simpson. She was twice issued a letter of marque, which authorized her captain to take offensive action against French vessels, not just defensive action, should the opportunity arise. The first was issued on 20 March 1810 to Henry Moore, as master of Archduke Charles. Between 1810 and 1812, Archduke Charles was in the South Seas. She may have engaged in whaling, but this is not certain. Her second letter of marque was issued to John Paul Jeffreys on 20 March 1812. In 1813, Archduke Charles, J.P. Jeffries [sic], transported convicts from Ireland to Australia. She departed Cork on 15 May 1812. She called at Rio de Janeiro where Indefatigable and Minstrel joined her. The three vessels left Rio together on 11 August, but Archduke Charles parted the next day. Six days after they left Rio, a gale separated Minstrel and Indefatigable. Archduke Charles lost her rudder in a gale on 8 September, which delayed her. She reached the Cape on 25 September. There she effected repairs and did not depart until 19 December.Lloyd's List, no.4762 - accessed 4 August 2015 Archduke Charles arrived on 16 February 1813 in Port Jackson, New South Wales. She had embarked 147 male and 54 female convicts; two male convicts died during the voyage. She was one of only two convict transports after 1811 to carry both men and women convicts; after 1815, no vessel did. Archduke Charles then again engaged in whaling, before returning to Port Jackson. She left Port Jackson on 17 September bound for China. There were eight stowaways aboard. When Archduke Charles arrived at China the authorities apprehended the stowaways and returned them to Australia in 1815 on the Frederick.Convict or Felon?: Convict Ship Archduke Charles 1813 - accessed 4 August 2015.

On 29 May 1816 she embarked half of the Nova Scotia Fencibles regiment, some 210 officers and other ranks, together with 48 wives and children.

In the late 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi finished unifying Japan and he invaded Korea twice. The aim of the attack was to prepare for conquering China in the future. Although he failed in the end, this action symbolized the starting of Japan's expansion. In the late Tokugawa shogunate, many advisers had thoughts of conquering different lands and setting up colonies. Honda Toshiaki mentioned that Japan should begin conquering the world and become the world's strongest nation to be their ultimate aim. For this, he suggested they occupy Manchuria, Sakhalin, and Kamchatka Peninsula first, and follow the lead of Europe in setting up overseas colonies.Yu Lu. „ÄäËøë‰ª£Êó•Êú¨„ÄåÂ§ßÈô∏ÊîøÁ≠ñ„ÄçÂΩ¢ÊàêÁöÑÊÄùÊÉ≥Ê∫êÊµÅ„Äã.

This became the strategy used by Japan in World War II. Continental Policy after the Meiji Restoration In the mid-19th century, Japan had been strengthened by the Meiji Restoration and had built a modernized and centralized Japanese government. The Meiji Government greatly encouraged people to help modernize Japan, setting up industrial enterprises and starting their industrial revolution in mid-1880s. Due to many factors affecting Japan, Japan decided to be a military-based country, creating the Continental Policy. Japan‚Äôs plan and actions Plan Tanaka Giichi is alleged to have presented the so- called Tanaka Memorial, a plan outlining the procedures of Continental Policy in 1927. According to the presented text, \\"If we want to conquer the World, we need to conquer China first. If we want to conquer China, we need to conquer Mongolia and Manchuria first. If we want to conquer Mongolia and Manchuria, we need to conquer Korea and Taiwan first.\\"Katsuji Inahara. Japan's Continental Policy. Foreign Affairs Association of Japan. 1938. However, in the wake of the countless war crime accusations by the victorious Allies after World War II, intensive searches for a Japanese language original were unsuccessful, and the original document, if it existed at all, has never been found. Furthermore, in 1995, a former NKVD official stated that the document was a forgery created in 1931 by the Soviet Union to sow anti-Japanese sentiment abroad, especially in the United States.Romerstein and Breindel, 2001, pp. 520‚Äì521 While the Tanaka Memorial has been mentioned in newspapers and school textbooks in China, most Japanese historians contend that the document is a forgery.Stephan, \\"The Tanaka Memorial (1927),\\" p. 740. Actions Japan's first modern foreign action was the conquering of Ryukyu by the Satsuma Domain in 1879. However, this was not a part of a wider plan, and was done on the prerogative of the Satsuma Domain. Then, Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War and annexed Taiwan and Penghu in 1895. Following that, Japan built up a puppet state in Korea with the excuse of pacifying the Donghak Peasant Revolution. Japan finally occupied Korea in 1910. In 1932, Japan captured Manchuria and built the puppet state of Manchukuo. Japan attacked China in 1937 and tried to finish the Continental Policy. But Japan failed to conquer China and lost in World War II, costing Japan all of her overseas land. This also symbolized the end of Japan's expansion and the failure of the Continental Policy.

The tribe mostly populates the western slopes of Shinghar, a mountain in the Suleiman Range, though a considerable number reside in the Zhob District. There is also a scattered population in the Duki subdivision of Loralai District, Sanjavi subdivision of the Ziarat District, a small population in Quetta, and some in Zarkanai Daraban of Dera Ismail Khan district. The word Harifal is also transliterated as Airf Aal, Haripal, and Hurreepaul. The two union councils of Sherani district, Shinghar Harifal south with 23 villages (13,883 people) and Shinghar Harifal north with 31 villages (12,228 people), are altogether occupied by the Harifal tribe. The main bulk of the tribe lives in clusters of villages in the central block of Mt. Shinghar. The Harifal tribe is relatively small and tractable compared to other tribes. The total votersECP SHERANI of the Harifal tribe is numbered at 8,728, and gender-wise breakup is as follows: male: 4,797 and female: 3,931. There is an ancestral link between the Harifal and the Shirani tribe, but the Harifal is considered separate. Etymology The term Harifal has undergone etymological change. As it is pronounced in the manner favoured by Pashtuns. Harifal, in Pashto, is the corrupted form of Arif Aal, meaning progeny of Arif, the founder of the tribe. The actual name of this eponymous ancestor was \\"Arif-Ullah\\". The word Harifal has undergone change over time, and so it has been variously transliterated as Arif Aal, Haripal, and Harifal. These words are all homophones but heterographs, and Harifal is the most correct one. History Under Arif's leadership, the Shiranis sent a portion of their tribe to occupy Bargha. Arif later married a Shirani women (according to tradition, his second wife and the mother of the Ibrahikhail sub-tribe), and thus became the eponymous ancestor of the Harifal tribe. This account is corroborated by Olaf Caroe, who wrote that \\"the genealogies frequently supply actual confirmation of observable differences today.\\" An account of the warlike nature of the Harifal and Sherani tribes is given by the Scottish historian Mountstuart Elphinstone in his book An account of the kingdom of Caubul, and its dependencies in Persia, Tartary, and India: comprising a view of the Afghaun nation, and a history of the Dooraunee monarch, \\"The Sheeraunees [Sheranis] are at war with all the tribes that pass through their country in their annual migrations. They may, indeed, be said to be at war with all the world, since they plunder every traveller that comes within their reach; and besides, make incursions into parts of Damaun, with the inhabitants of which they have no quarrel. While I was in their neighbourhood, they stopped the body of a Dooraunee of rank, which was going through their country to be buried at Candahar, and detained it till a ransom had been paid for it.\\"An account of the kingdom of Caubul, and its dependencies in Persia, Tartary ... - Mountstuart Elphinstone - Google Books (page 383) However, due to the influence of legendary accounts of Arif's peaceful nature, the Harifal restrained their warlike nature and became relatively docile. The Harifal are more quiet and industrious, and their habits are decidedly averse from the system of violence pursued by other tribes. In personal bravery and endurance of privation and hardship, they are esteemed superior to other inhabitants around. In manner they are mild, inoffensive and tenacious in respectability. Historical records Mountstuart Elphinstone (1779‚Äì1859) says \\"The tribes of Hurreepaul (sic) and Kuppeep resemble the Sheeraunees, of which tribe they are branches; and their residence is in the hills and valleys at the western base of Tukhti Solimaun. To the north of the Hurreepaul is the country near the junction of the Gomul and Zhobe, sometimes pastured on by wandering Cankers. North of it is Wauneh, a low plain situated on the hills that slope down to the valley of the Gomul.\\" According to Baluchistan Through the Ages, \\"The Haripals claim a Saiad descent, and allege that their progenitor, Harif, was a Saiad from Pishin, who migrated to the Shirani country, married a Shirani woman, and was affiliated with the Shiranis\\".Baluchistan through the ages P68. vol ii. Herbert Benjamin Edwardes says \\"It is by the Zirkunnee Pass that caravans go to Kandahar. About five or six miles to the south of the Zirkunnee Pass, is the Pass of Drabund, the mouth of which is about eight miles from Drabund itself. Not very far from midway between the town and the Pass of Drabund, but rather nearer to the latter, are ruins of the former fort of Akhoond Gool Hubeeb. This Akhoond, I was informed, belonged to a tribe called Hurrial, connected with the Sheraunees; the same probably as that of 'Hurreepaul,' mentioned by Mr. Elphinstone as a branch of the Sheraunees, residing 'in the hills and valleys at the western base of Tukht-e-Sulaiman'.\\"A year on the Punjab frontier, by Herbert Benjamin Edwardes in 1848-49 (Volume 1 ) page 551-2 Qazi Abdul Haleem Asar Afghani (1910-1987), a well known Pashto writer (District Mardan, Tehsil Takht Bhai) holds that \\"Harifal is a minor tribe living in and around Daraban amongst Sheranis. In the twelfth generation of this tribe was a renowned saint by the name of Sheikh Ahmed Zinda-pir. Sheikh Ahmed Zinda-pir had five sons; eldest among them was Sadar-ud-din, who later became famous by the name of Sheikh Sadar-ud-din Sadar Jahan; an erudite and noted Sufi saint. He migrated to India to spread the word of Islam. In India he reached \\"Malir Kotla and settled there. Sheikh later married daughter of Sultan Behlul Lodhi. This gave much impetus to his reputation. Stories of Hazrat Shaikh's erudition and piety spread far and wide and gradually Malerkotla became the seat of Sufism in India.\\"Roohani Rabita au Roohani Taroon by Qazi Abdul Haleem Asar p 415 Shaikh Sadar Ud-din also known as Haidar Shaikh was born at Daraban, the winter dwellings of the Harifal tribe, in 1437. In 1449, he reached Multan and became the disciple of Baha-ud-din Zakariya. When his master was sure that his disciple was well versed in spirituality, he asked him to go out and help humanity. The Sheikh chose a raised mound near the old village of Maler to build his hut, and there he used to spend his time in prayer. One distinguished member of this family was Zulfiqar Ali Khan who, although not a nawab, was a figure in the literary history of the riyasat. A close friend of allama Muhammad Iqbal, he was the author of the first biography of the famous poet, titled A Voice from the East. Stanley Reed (28 January 1872 ‚Äì 17 January 1969) was a British Conservative Party politician and an important figure in the media of India in the early 20th century. He claims;The British India founded that Maler kotla's ruling family, though famed as Pathan, is actually Sayyid in its origin, for its ancestral progenitor was Sayyid Husain who migrated from Ghaur during the reign of caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (646‚Äì705 the 5th Umayyad Caliph) and settled in the region neighboring \`Kooh-e-Sulaiman.My State, Malerkotla Geography The Harifal tribe lives on Shinghar, which are separated from the Sulaiman Mountains by the valley of Lahar. The main peak of Shinghar is 9,273 feet above sea level, and the mountain extends from Kurchpina in the north to Sulyazai valley in the south. With relation to nearby towns, is to the west of the Takht-e-Sulaiman, and about 50 km east of Zhob. The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation has reported finding significant coal deposits near Shinghar. The average elevation of Harifal territory is 2,043 meters from sea level. Harifal territory is situated 372 kilometers south west of the capital, Islamabad. The location is sparsely populated, with 21 people per square kilometer. The predominant form of vegetation in the area is the olive tree, though Ephedra is also abundantly found in Harifal territory. Known locally as \\"oman,\\" the plant was once purchased in large quantities by Quetta Marker Company. There is also a dense forest of edible pine (Pinus gerardiana) (In Urdu ⁄ÜŸÑÿ∫Ÿàÿ≤ÿß Ÿæÿßÿ¶ŸÜ) which covers the mountains, growing at an elevation from 1800 meters to 3350 meters. The nearby village of Ghwanza contains a shrine of the Sufi saint Hazrat Babakr Nika Harifal, which is frequently visited by pilgrims. Weather and climate Harifal territory is in a very strong (vii) earthquake zone, with occurrences of earthquakes at 6-7 on the Richter magnitude scale. Harifal has an arid (0.05 - 0.2 p/pet) climate. Land area is not cultivated; most of the natural vegetation is still intact. The landscape is mostly covered with closed to open grassland. There is a moderate occurrence of periods with extreme drought. Additionally, flood risk is low. The climate is classified as a subtropical steppe (low-latitude dry), with a subtropical thorn wood land biozone. Weather varies according to the locality, and the heat or the cold is felt in different spots in the same latitude with very different degrees of intensity, according to the configuration of the country. Winter is mild; on the plain the snow melts as it falls, and does not lie long even on the summits of the mountains. In general the temperature is moderate. September is on average the month with most sunshine. Rainfall and other precipitation have no distinct peak month. Demographics The Harifal are divided into clans, the clans into sections and sections into subsections. According to the 1901 census, the population of Harifal was 1,593, with the following divisions of sub-tribes: Ibrahikhail (180), Hamakzai (sic)(5), Hasankhail (706), Naqibkhail (630), and Umerzai (3). According to the 1998 census its population is 36,111. An estimated 5.64% of the children below 5 years old are underweight, with a mortality of 66 per 1,000 births.

The killings, which came to be known as the Clear Lake Murders, made national headlines. Paolilla, who was 17 years old at the time of the murders, was accompanied by her then-boyfriend, Christopher Snider. She was arrested on July 19, 2006, three years and one day after the murders were committed. Paolilla was convicted in October 2008 and sentenced to life in prison. Snider committed suicide in July 2006 before he was apprehended by police. Early life Paolilla was born on Long Island, New York to Lori, a stay-at-home mom, and Charles Paolilla, a construction worker. She has one older brother. When Paolilla was 2 years old, her father was killed in a construction accident. Following the death of her husband, Lori Paolilla began abusing drugs and eventually lost custody of her children to her parents. When Paolilla was in kindergarten, she was diagnosed with alopecia which caused her to lose her hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. As a result of the hair loss, Paolilla was forced to wear wigs. She also had poor vision and wore thick glasses. Paolilla was frequently ridiculed and bullied by her classmates for her appearance, which affected her self-confidence. Paolilla was eventually reunited with her mother who had overcome her drug addiction and remarried. The family then moved to Clear Lake City, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Paolilla enrolled at Clear Lake High School. She was befriended by two popular students, Rachael Koloroutis and Tiffany Rowell, who helped her improve her appearance and fit in with the other students. In 2003, Paolilla was voted \\"Miss Irresistible\\" by her school's student body. That year, she also began a relationship with 21-year-old Christopher Lee Snider. Paolilla's mother and stepfather disapproved of Snider, as did Koloroutis and Rowell, because of his frequent drug use and extensive criminal record. These fears would be substantiated, as Paolilla would increasingly experiment with various drugs during the year she and Snider were in a relationship. Lori Paolilla later recalled that Snider isolated her daughter from her friends and family and indicated that she had been raped and that the relationship was both abusive and dysfunctional. Snider's family also said the relationship was tumultuous and that Paolilla was prone to jealousy. After one fight with Snider, Paolilla spent the night on the front lawn of his family's home and threatened to kill his family. Murders On July 18, 2003, Paolilla and Snider went to her friend Tiffany Rowell's home in Clear Lake City. Also at the home were Rachael Koloroutis, Rowell's boyfriend Marcus Precella, and Precella's cousin Adelbert Sanchez. According to Paolilla, she and Snider planned to steal the drugs that were kept at the house but Snider reportedly got into an argument with Precella which led to the shootings of Rowell, Koloroutis, Precella, and Sanchez. All four victims were shot multiple times. Rachael Koloroutis attempted to crawl to a phone to call 911 after she was shot but Paolilla struck her in the head multiple times with the butt of a 38-caliber revolver, bashing in her skull. Koloroutis and Rowell were both shot in the crotch, a sign of sexual jealousy. Snider and Paolilla left little evidence at the crime scene leading police to suspect that the killings were drug related as Marcus Precella was said to have sold drugs from the home. Adelbert Sanchez had moved to Clear Lake to get away from violence on the north side to change his life around and he had only been in Clear Lake for about a week or two before losing his life. The only evidence police had were descriptions of the suspects who were seen walking to and from the home by neighbors. An hour after the murders, Snider drove Paolilla to Walgreens where she was scheduled to work the makeup counter. Apprehension In 2004, Paolilla and Snider ended their relationship after Snider was jailed in Kentucky for car theft. Shortly thereafter, Paolilla entered rehab in Kerrville, Texas. It was there that she met Stanley Justin Rott, a heroin user with whom she began a relationship. The couple married in March 2005. Around that time, Paolilla came into a $360,000 trust fund left to her by her father. Paolilla used a portion of the money to buy an apartment. In July 2005, the second anniversary of the murders, Paolilla saw a newscast on television about the still unsolved case. She became upset after seeing sketches of the suspects given by neighbors and confessed to Rott that she and Snider had committed the murders. The couple then went into hiding. By November 2005, Paolilla and Rott were living in a motel room in San Antonio. For the next eight months, the couple holed up in the room, shooting heroin and cocaine. On July 8, 2006, police received an anonymous tip via Crimestoppers regarding the murders of Rowell, Koloroutis, Precella, and Sanchez. The male caller told police that he had been in rehab with Paolilla who had admitted to being a participant in the crime (it was later reported that Justin Rott was not the man who called in the tip). Police tracked Paolilla down in San Antonio and arrested her on July 19, 2006. (Paolilla's husband was also arrested as police found 70 vials of heroin in the couple's room). After their arrests, Rott told police that Paolilla had confessed to him that she had been an active participant in the murders. He stated that Paolilla had gone back into the house and beat Koloroutis to death with a gun, after finding her still clinging to life and attempting to summon help. Paolilla initially denied killing her friends, but eventually admitted to participating in the murders but placed all the blame on her ex-boyfriend, Christopher Snider. On July 21, 2006, Paolilla and Snider, who had not yet been apprehended, were charged with capital murder. Paolilla's bail was set at $500,000 as she was considered a flight risk. In June 2006, Christopher Snider moved to Greenville, South Carolina where he was living with a woman he met online. After Paolilla's arrest that July, one of Snider's family members called to inform him that police had issued a warrant for his arrest in relation to the murders. Acting on a tip that Snider may have committed suicide, police went to Greenville and searched near an area where Snider was reported to have been seen. His decomposing body was found in a heavily wooded area on August 5, 2006. It was later determined that Snider had overdosed on prescription medication. Conviction Mountain View Unit, where Paolilla is imprisoned On October 13, 2008, Paolilla was convicted of four counts of capital murder. As she had been a juvenile offender at the time of the killings, she was spared the death penalty. The following day, she was sentenced to life in prison. Paolilla filed an appeal on November 29, 2008 on the grounds that \\"the trial court abused its discretion in setting [Paolilla's] amount of bail at $500,000\\". An appeals panel decided that the court did not abuse its discretion and affirmed Paolilla's original sentence. She has since filed additional appeals which have also been denied. As of 2020, Paolilla is incarcerated at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas and will be eligible for parole in 2046, when she will be aged 60.\\"Paolilla, Christine Marie \\" (Archive ).

It was designed by William Paul. The house was expanded by William Jennings, mayor of Salt Lake City from 1882 to 1885, again using Paul as the architect. Devereaux was a social center for the Salt Lake City area, hosting distinguished visitors. Brigham Young's son Joseph Angell Young owned the house for a short time. Description The house is Victorian in character, with evidence of French-influenced detailing. It is built of brick with cement plaster overlay. A mansard roof forms the third floor. A wide porch wraps around the south and east sides. The grand house and its large yard have been preserved in the middle of the city without a perimeter fence, so the yard has the appearance of a park. William Jennings expanded and landscaped the grounds. The house is surrounded by larger and newer structures including Vivint Smart Home Arena, the Triad Center, and the Salt Lake City Union Pacific Depot and the surrounding The Gateway development. The interior features a large stair hall with a drawing room to the left and a library to the right. To the rear of the parlor lies a banquet room, and a dining room is behind the library. The second floor has many bedrooms, and the attic houses servants' quarters and a billiard room. The house was noted for the high quality of its woodwork and appointments. History The house was the first to be built on a scale that could be described as a \\"mansion\\" in the Salt Lake Valley. It was a social center for the area, and was the scene of a meeting between Brigham Young and Governor Alfred Cumming to resolve the Utah War. The house was purchased for $20,000 by Young's oldest son, Joseph Angell Young in 1865. Young sold the house for $30,000 in 1867 to local entrepreneur William Jennings who added to the house. Jennings, believed to be the Salt Lake Valley's first millionaire, named the house \\"Devereaux\\" for a family property at Yardley, Birmingham in England. Jennings lived there with his wives Jane and Pricilla, who had eleven and fourteen children respectively. Jennings was visited at the house by Secretary of War William Seward and General Philip H. Sheridan in the 1860s, and by General William Tecumseh Sherman in the 1870s, whose visits implied a tolerance of polygamy in Utah by federal officials. Following Jennings' death in 1886 the house passed through several hands, and was at one time an alcohol treatment facility, the Keely Institute. At a later time it accommodated offices for a mining equipment company. The State of Utah acquired the property in the 1970s and approved the use of public funds to restore it in 1978, but a tragic fire in 1979 almost resulted in its demolition. It was ultimately restored in the early 1980s and served as a reception center and home of the Chart House restaurant. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acquired it in 2005 and maintains it as a historic site with occasional use for receptions and other events.

Below is a list of presidents of what is now known as Tennessee State University. William Jasper Hale (1912-1943) William Jasper Hale was appointed as the first head of TSU, then known as the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal School. The original 247 students, along with the faculty and staff, operated as a family. Everyone worked to keep the institution running in its early years from clearing rocks and harvesting crops to carrying chairs from class to class. The school was raised to the status of a four-year teachers' college in 1922 and became empowered to grant the bachelor's degree. Commencement exercises for the first college class were held in 1924, awarding degrees to seven men and one woman. In 1927, the school's name was changed to Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Teachers College. As Tennessee State grew in scope and stature throughout the 1920s and 1930s, so too did its impressive roster of alumni who embodied the school's charge: \\"Enter to learn, go forth to serve.\\" In 1943, when President Hale retired following more than 30 years at the school's helm, an alumnus was chosen to succeed him. Walter S. Davis (1943-1968) From 1943 until his retirement in 1968, Walter S. Davis led Tennessee State through an era of tremendous growth in academics, facilities and worldwide recognition. Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College achieved university status in 1951, and the Tennessee Board of Education elevated the university to a full-fledged land-grant university in 1957. Under Davis's leadership, 24 new buildings were constructed on the campus. During his tenure, athletes from Tennessee State commanded the attention of the nation and the world by winning national championships in football, basketball and swimming, and national titles and Olympic medals in track and field. Andrew P. Torrence (1968-1974) In 1968, Andrew Torrence, also an alumnus, was named the university's third president. Throughout his relatively brief tenure, the university strengthened its focus on academics and introduced a broader array of offerings. During this time the university, through a bill passed by the state legislature, formally dropped \\"Agricultural and Industrial\\" from its name and became Tennessee State University. Still, one of the most significant events of the Torrence presidency would not be fully resolved or have its impact felt for decades to come. It was in 1968 that a TSU faculty member named Rita Sanders filed a lawsuit alleging a dual system of higher education in Tennessee based on race. An agreement in that case, which over the years evolved into Geier v. Tennessee, would not be reached until 2001. Frederick S. Humphries (1975-1985) When Frederick Humphries became TSU's president in 1975, Nashville still was home to two public, four-year universities. In 1979, the University of Tennessee at Nashville was merged into Tennessee State University, and UTN's site became TSU's downtown campus. Humphries was the first TSU president to face the challenge of maintaining the balance between TSU's role as one of America's preeminent historically black universities and as an emerging comprehensive, national university. Otis Floyd (interim 1986-1987, 1987-1990) TSU's fifth president, Otis Floyd, assumed his post in 1987 following a year as interim president. He was appointed chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents in 1990. Floyd kept TSU moving forward in both capacities, initiating efforts that resulted in the university receiving an unprecedented $112 million from the state general assembly for capital improvements. James A. Hefner (1991-2005) Dr. James A. Hefner became the sixth president of Tennessee State University in 1991. During his 14-year tenure as president, he implemented the $112 million capital improvement plan secured by his predecessor. Jefferson Street was closed off through the campus, and several new buildings were erected, including a massive campus center, a new administration building, and a performing arts center. Major renovations of historic buildings were completed, and total enrollment grew to 9,100 students. Melvin N. Johnson (2005-2011) Dr. Melvin N. Johnson was named the seventh president of Tennessee State University on March 10, 2005, assumed leadership of TSU on June 1, 2005 and retired effective January 2, 2011. Tennessee State University partnered with the Small Business Administration to open the first business recovery center in Tennessee. Johnson was instrumental in continuing to bring national attention to the university by recognizing the Freedom Riders and awarding them honorary doctorate degrees, engaging the university in the Tennessee Campus Compact, receiving national awards for community service and engagement, securing $8 million in Race to the Top Funds by President Obama and obtaining Community Engagement Classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Dr. Johnson is a graduate of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State UniversityNorth Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. Dr. Portia Holmes Shields (interim 2011-2012)  Dr. Portia Shields was appointed as Interim President of Tennessee State University effective January 2, 2011. Under the terms of her contract, she is not allowed to apply for the permanent position of university president. Dr. Shields made sweeping changes to the university which led to a more involved and active alumni and staff.http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/board-regents-names- shields-tsu-interim-president Dr. Glenda Baskin Glover (2013-present)  Dr. Glenda Baskin Glover began serving as President of Tennessee State University on January 2, 2013.

She was the daughter of freedom fighter and post-Independence Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Educated in Bombay, Maniben adopted the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi in 1918, and started working regularly at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Early life Maniben was born on 3 April 1903 at Karamasad, Bombay Presidency, British India. She lost her mother when she was 6 years of age. She was brought up by her uncle Vitthalbhai Patel. She completed her early education at Queen Mary High School in Bombay. In 1920 she migrated to Ahmedabad and joined Rashtriya Vidhyapith started by Mahatma Gandhi. After completing her graduation in 1925, Maniben went on to assist her father.  Borsad Movement  In 1923-24 the British Government levied heavy taxes on the common people and for recovery of the same they started confiscating their cattle, land and property. To protest against this oppression, Maniben motivated women to come and join a campaign led by Gandhi and Sardar Patel and support the 'No-Tax Movement'. Bardoli Satyagrah Exorbitant taxation was levied by the British authorities on the peasants of Bardoli in 1928 and they were enduring similar harassament to that of Borsad. Mahatma Gandhi directed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to take leadership of the Satyagrah. Initially women were reluctant to join the movement. Maniben along with Mithuben Petit and Bhaktiba Desai motivated women, who ultimately outnumbered men in the movement. As a part of the protests they stayed in huts erected on land confiscated by the government. Rajkot Satyagrah During 1938, a Satyagrah was planned against the unjust rule of the Diwan of Rajkot State. Kasturba Gandhi was keen to join the Satyagrah despite her poor health and Maniben accompanied her. The government passed an order to separate both the ladies. Maniben went on a fast against the order and the authorities then allowed her to reunite with Kasturba Gandhi.  Non-cooperation movement  Mahatma Gandhi and Maniben Patel before his departure to Europe, 1931. She participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement as well as the Salt Satyagraha and was imprisoned for long periods of time. In the 1930s she became her father's aide, also caring for his personal needs. However, because Maniben Patel was committed to the liberation of India, and thus the Quit India movement, she was again imprisoned from 1942 to 1945 in Yerwada Central Jail. Maniben Patel served her father closely until his death in 1950. After moving to Mumbai, she worked for the rest of her life with numerous charitable organizations and for the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust. She went on to author an account of the freedom struggle as a book on her father's life in the years following Indian Independence.  Principles  Maniben always ensured that her and her father's clothes were weaved from khadi threads which were spun by her. She always insisted on travelling in third class.

The entertainment industry during this time was often controlled by a country's government. Since the governments believed that a supportive home front was crucial to their countries' victory, they generally sought to keep the civilian spirits high and to depict the war in a positive light. With this motive in mind, governments engaged in the regulation and censorship of the forms of media, as well as the introduction of new methods of informing citizens through these media outlets. Government censorship of mass media was enforced in much of the world during this time period in fear of threatening the domestic harmony of a nation. Some of the most popular forms of entertainment during World War II were radio, film, and music. In conjunction with one another, these forms of media kept citizens entertained with a pastime, informed about their country's war efforts, and motivated to contribute to the cause of the war. The radio was a great way to reach out to citizens and communicate with the community. Radio In comparison to television, radio was a much more affordable form of entertainment. Because of this, the radio was the most popular form of entertainment during World War II. Radio stations fueled propaganda and reached a countless number of citizens. Many shows popularized and quickly gained influence in certain countries. Radio broadcasts, like other forms of entertainment at the time, were regulated by the government and were pushed to keep citizens informed about war efforts and to encourage citizens to help the cause. Radio stations, along with other media outlets, were major fuels of propaganda during World War II. An example of a popular radio program is Tommy Handley's It's That Man Again, which continued airing throughout the war in Britain until 1949. Comedian Tommy Handley utilized his radio broadcasts to keep citizens informed about the war efforts and to keep the spirits of Britain high during this time of hardship. It's That Man Again garnered substantial influence - up to 40% of the British population listened to this show during World War II. The show's last broadcast occurred on January 6, 1949, with Handley passing away only three days later. To further demonstrate the show's influence, two memorial services were held in his honor, with thousands of listeners present at the funeral grounds. It's That Man Again was hosted on BBC, a broadcasting service program still widely known in Britain today. Like BBC, other broadcasting companies also attempted to keep civilian spirits high and expressed certain opinions on the war. Hosts of radio programs took sides regarding the war; for example, the Voice of Russia, the government's international radio broadcasting station, expressed the country's opinions and eventually targeted the United States. Radio programs were broadcast in up to twenty-three different languages, which widened the appeal of these stations.Anthony Rhodes, \\"Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II\\", 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Film The film industry during World War II was an important source of communication to the people on all sides. At this time the cinema was the most popular form of entertainment to the people. It was used to entertain, lift spirits, motivate and inform the audience. This made film an important means of distributing propaganda. Governments used film to influence the public to support the war effort in their everyday lives and to justify their actions. Film was a powerful force which unified the nations. Cinemas provided for a good place to watch information films. New films that showed in cinemas were often informative of a country's war efforts or the progress of the war itself. Furthermore, the government released additional films that were designed to model the desired human behaviors and actions during the war. These government films often suggested methods of coping with the loss of families and homes and to inform the audience to caution the presence of enemy spies. Though Philo Farnsworth had invented the first working television system in 1927, only few people owned television sets because of its price and scarcity. Since most citizens did not own televisions, they relied on cinemas to keep informed and educated. Cinemas of Europe and the United States were mostly regulated by the government. Films made during this time period were more realistic than escapist, in contrast to entertainment during the Great Depression. Hollywood (United States) From December 8, 1941 is when the USA entered WWII. It was a big year for the country because they had to arrange for the results of the war. The main focus that the US wanted to make on films was their own historical phenomena and a spread of US culture. The war films made focused mostly on the \\"desperate affirmation\\" and the \\"societal tensions\\". Many films main focus was about the war; they wanted to make sure that they explain the objectives. The US war films were good and bad, many of them showed the different lives of the people during the war. The importance of these films and as studies have mentioned, is the influence behind these films. Furthermore, war films showed a lot of information about the war and the life of their families just like the film Since You Went Away. When the US government noticed the content of the feature films they became more interested in the political and social significance messages in the film. This shows how Hollywood wanted to raise two important production of films together with war films. With the growth of the film industry came the growth of the influence of Hollywood celebrities. Hollywood stars appeared in advertisements and toured the country to encourage citizens to purchase war bonds to support their country in the war. =Propaganda= The film industry during the Second World War was able to communicate with large audiences. In this way, it was a very powerful source of mass communication and could be used for propaganda purposes. A great deal of explicit and implicit propaganda took place within the film industry and the cinemas. The film industry stereotyped Hitler and the Nazis as cold-hearted with an authoritarian regime. For example, the movie Beast of Berlin. Interestingly, was shot in less than a week and this was the first Hollywood film to show the brutal treatment of resisting heroes in concentration camps at the hands of vicious gestapo officers. This was the first film to depict life in Germany under Nazi Rule. More movies that showed a lack of sympathy for religion, the Jews and intellectuals by a ruthless Nazi regime flourished. Movies like The Mortal Storm, The Man I Married, Hitler's Children and Pastor Hall all portrayed these as victims of the Nazis. In 1941, the US entered the war and more films were made to reinforce an image of the Nazis as \\"Army officers as impeccable aristocrats, cold, aloof and efficient, Gestapo men as clever and merciless‚Ä¶. And the German soldier as efficient, displinced, and unswervingly patriotic\\". This was a strong image of a military regime which did not respect the individual or democracy. Hollywood did not just focus on stereotyping Nazis but also in raising the moral of the people. Movies that depict \\"war\\" reinforced the message that the war would not be permanent and that a better world and society would be created in the end. Hence, they were aimed at keeping the moral of the nation high and convincing the people that the war justified and righteous. For example, movies like The Story of G.I. Joe, Dive Bomber, So Proudly We Hail! and Sahara all displayed the humanitarian principles of the allies in contrast to the brutality of the enemy and gave justification to the public to fight the war. Film historian Arthur F. Mclure states that these motivational films had two purposes: \\"to give unity of purpose for the war itself and to give strength of purpose to the people on the home front\\". Propaganda not only was used to create an impression of an evil Nazi enemy but also to instill in the people the justification of the war they were in and Hollywood provided this in its film production. Hollywood believed that \\"the role that films should play in time of war was a bone of contention within the industry\\" which describes the conflict between patriotism and art was ongoing throughout the war. = Censorship = Theater attendance was at an all-time high in 1946, proving to be Hollywood's most profitable year of the decade. For the United States, the propaganda agency that coordinated actions with the film industry was the Office of War Information. The agency worked with film makers to record and photograph wartime activities while regulating its content. The agency worked to display the war in a positive light and censored negative content like pictures of soldier insanity and casualty; pictures of American casualties were banned from being published until 1943. Hollywood was controlled by the government through the United States Office of War Information (OWI). A branch of this organization, The Bureau of Motion Picture informed Hollywood about key issues which the government wanted the industry to promote. Hollywood did not easily accept governmental control. Clayton R. Koppes and Gregory D. Black stated in the book Hollywood Goes To War: How Politics, Profits and Propaganda Shaped World War II Movies highlighted how \\"From a mixture of patriotism and the profit motive, Hollywood became a compliant part of the American war machine\\". The film industry cooperated with the government and included the required ideas within the films but the government was constantly suspicious of Hollywood and kept an FBI investigation of all activities. In 2008, documents published by the National Archives leaked to the public regarding the involvement of numerous Hollywood celebrities with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Some 750,000 documents reveal that famous American public figures were actually spies for the Office of Strategic Services. These celebrities include celebrity chef Julia Child and baseball player Moe Berg, who were hired to gather information required by the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff. = Prominent Hollywood Film Directors = * Frank Capra * George Stevens * William Wyler * John Ford * John Huston  Britain  The film industry in Britain during World War II was highly important to the country and had a huge impact on the citizens. Interestingly, two days after Britain declared war on Germany the government ordered that all public entertainment places to close which included \\"4300 cinemas\\". Within two weeks, this was revoked and far from being afraid to go to the cinema the attendances grew steadily. In fact \\"cinemas thrived in wartime, and attendance figures surged upward from an average of just under 20 million weekly admissions in 1939 to over 30 million weekly admissions in 1944 and 1945. In a country with a population of approximately 48 million people. This is a clear indication of the part that films played in the lives of the ordinary people to either escape reality. Statistics show that \\"The Wartime Social Survey\\", conducted in 1943, found that 32% of Britons went to the cinema frequently (defined as once a week or more) and another 38% attended occasionally (defined as once a fortnight or less)\\". Therefore, more than half of the British population were regular cinema goers. There were many reasons why the cinema was so popular. During this time everybody was employed but food was rationed and not everyone especially women wanted to spend their time in pubs. Therefore, a cinema was a secure and warm place to go to where a person could escape their own homes which often had lodgers living with them and spend their money. = Propaganda = Propaganda was also prevalent in the British film industry movies such as Miss Grant Goes to the Door and The Way ahead were made. The film Miss Grant Goes to the Door, showed audiences how to recognize German spies, how to hide Ordnance Survey maps from enemies, and how to be of aid to soldiers and sailors ‚Äì women were encouraged to knit socks and mittens for sailors. This film further reminded citizens that ‚Äò‚ÄôCromwell‚Äô‚Äô was the codeword to signify the invasion of Britain. Some of the propaganda films made in Britain were sponsored by the government to be featured films with a message motivate the audience. Even Though television had been invented it was in its infancy and very few people had a television set. The only home entertainment for most people was a radio or a gramophone.  Germany  Films in Germany played a dominant figure in propaganda during World War II in Germany. WWII was a blow to Germans film centers. The film industry in Germany was controlled by the Nazis which was the greatest political party at the time. The ordering of the closure of the films was given where they were reopened later under the control of Nazi. People relied on the industry to acquire news and get entertained. It is the place where people were going to get their stresses off. The films had shown promoting the nations culture where people would watch and learn what was expected of them. People did not have televisions during World War II and the only place they would get chances of watching were the film centers and entertainment joints. The film industry was initially the source of information for the nation's citizens. The broadcast helped them understand what was happening in the world, especially with the two major operating films. On taking control, the Nazi party ensured that what they wanted to be known. This had an impact on the citizens because the content depicted was merely Nazism in cinema. Films depicted messages which provided people with information against the Jews. It tried to explain how Jews were bad people and \\"why they looked like rats\\". Spreading diseases, making the nation dirty and slowing the other nations‚Äô economies was all that the German citizens were fed with about the Jews so that they could also hate and collaborate in fighting them. The nation's values were disrupted where people were expected to follow the iron fist and what was provided on the films rather than what rotated around their way of life and cultural practices. The film industry was filled with lies and negative information meant to destroy people's relations and give Nazi more support. Propaganda was evident in the Germany film Industry films such as Der Marsch zum F√ºhrer and Menschen im Sturm. These films showed the nationwide march of Hitler Youth to Nuremberg for the Nazi Party Rally. Also, it showed the justification of Germany's invasion of Slovenia. Fritz Kirchhoff was a director who showed anti-British propaganda in his films. Kirchhoff directed Attack on Baku (1942) which was filmed in Germany intending to show messages against the British while including aspects of German patriotism. Patriotism was evoked by the means of utilizing the German literature of the 19th century. The nation was already well-read on most of popular German writings of that period. It was the task of Nazi cinema to strategically target the population, in this case the German nation and convince them to visit theaters. The profit from the sales was ever-growing and came in handy for the means of mobilizing the nation. The profitability of the Nazi movie industry receive such a great demand that it operated all the way up until the end of the War,1945. One of the last movies directed during 1945 was Kolberg, which gained popularity due to the fact it contained the most convincing speeches for the viewers to keep fighting to the end. = Popular German Propaganda Films = * Der Marsch zum F√ºhrer * Die Rothschilds *Der ewige Jude *Venus vor Gericht * Menschen im Sturm  Film Genres  Between 1939 and 1942, there were 1,313 feature films produced worldwide of these 374 films had a connection with war. Of the films with a war-connection 43 films dealt with why America was fighting the war while 107 films dealt with the enemy. There are nearly two and a half times the number of film about the enemy then the justification for war. A further 68 films dealt with the allies. The remaining films are split into two groups either the 65 home-front films made which included life under war-time conditions and other occupations such as red-cross or air-raid wardens. The remaining 95 films were feature length about American soldiers fighting the war.Cover Page of 361x361px Most of the films in this period were about the enemy and had a propaganda basis. Films were created to influence the audience to believe that the enemy was evil followed by films showing the bravery of the American forces. After this came, equal categories of supporting the allies and the Homefront followed by the fewest films which covered the reason why America was fighting the war. This follows a recognized pattern for propaganda where validation of an action is the least priority and concepts are a high priority.  Impact of the film industry  During this period, the cinema was the most popular pastime in fact following the war \\"the average 'A' film reached an audience of thirteen million in 1948, a large audience than could be claimed by any single magazine, book or newspaper\\". It was the prime form for entertainment and reached all members of society. In fact, going to the cinema was such a special occasion because the audience were treated to the entertainment within dazzling movie palaces. These buildings equated with the power of this industry they not only showed films but they were prime source of news distribution because they held such large audiences. Cinema-going was not just to see feature films but the audience also watched news articles such as Pathe News which were important for the government to inform the population. Most moviegoers had family members participating in the war and were suffering hardships in there daily life and the cinema was an effective form of escapism from reality. Not only in the films but also in the magazine \\"Picture-goer\\" which followed the film industry throughout this period. The magazine describes Hollywood glamour \\"an impossible ideal‚Ä¶ but also one that freed women expectation of self sacrifice\\". Men and women tried to imitate the fashion and styles of there stars in order to raise their spirits.The film industry in that era did not solely focus of propaganda but also created psychological support and motivation through its film stars. Music The theme of war took a popular role in the development of pop music. Artists expressed their feelings of hardships during the war. Others sang songs that aimed to lift the spirits of the citizens. British singer Vera Lynn, or the Forces Sweetheart, sang popular songs such as \\"We'll Meet Again\\" and \\"The White Cliffs of Dover\\", which restored an optimistic outlook for soldiers and families while uplifting Allied spirits during a time of hardship when Nazi Germany was bombing Britain. American singer and stage actress Adelaide Hall also entertained extensively throughout WWII entertaining both the public and the troops in the UK and with ENSA across Europe. Adelaide Hall starring in Piccadixie at the Finsbury Park Empire, London, 28 July 1941 \\"The Last Time I Saw Paris\\" was a 1941 Academy Award-winning song by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein, which illustrated memories of the magnificent city of Paris that had been taken over by Germany prior to the song's release. The Andrews Sisters' \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" expressed the feelings of a man's draft experience. Many listeners could relate because of the number of people drafted into the war.  Government involvement in the music industry  Government agencies pushed music producers to record more patriotic and uplifting songs. The Office of War Information especially pushed for this following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in the United States. In her book God Bless America, Kathleen E.R. Smith states that only twenty-seven war-themed songs had reached the top ten charts during the span of the war.Smith, Kathleen E. R. God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2003. This suggests that these patriotic war- themed songs, pushed by the government, did not sell well. Billboard archives suggest that the public preferred escapist and rather lighthearted songs. Female singers became more prominent by singing songs expressing the war from the woman's point of view, illustrating feelings of separation and loneliness. Furthermore, as musicians joined the military, larger bands shrunk and often disbanded, creating a trend towards soloists and smaller music groups. Musician contributions to the war Many musicians contributed to the war effort. Musician Glenn Miller enlisted in the army to perform in the United States Organization, in which he established the Army Air Force Band. Musician Irving Berlin assisted in the war effort by creating the \\"This is the Army\\" musical, which raised millions by playing on Broadway and for the US troops. Impact of the war Because of the war, approximately 15 million people \\"crossed county lines\\" and brought about the spread of different music styles like country music and African-American styles.Ennis, Philip H. The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rock 'n' Roll in American Popular Music. Hanover: Wesleyan University Press, published by University of New England Press, 1992. Even the war itself influenced the music industry through its technology. The capture of Germany's magnetic tape technology became a staple in music production for independent producers. Magnetic tape sound recording allowed for independent producers to produce high quality sounds without the assistance of major labels. Dance Changes in music correlated to the evolution of dances. Ballroom dancing gained popularity when people were looking to have a good time. The Grafton Ballroom in Britain was famed for its architecture and interior at the time. The evolution of music brought about new sounds such as jazz and swing music. These sounds translated to new dances. Jitterbug dancing grew in popularity. The Jive, which was taken to England by American troops, eventually became a dance of the International style of Ballroom dance.

He was appointed Royal Governor of South Carolina in 1738, but did not arrive in the province until December 17, 1743. He served as governor until June 1, 1756 and was succeeded by William Henry Lyttelton. On June 21, 1761, Glen returned to Europe and died in London. He is buried in Linlithgow, Scotland.  Governorship  James Glen has the longest term of governorship of any of those of colonial South Carolina. His term was noted for extensive dealings with Native American tribes on the colony's western and southern borders.  Controversy over Salary  Traditionally the governor of South Carolina played the role of defender of the southern frontier but with the creation of Georgia that role passed to the Georgian governor James Oglethorpe. This transfer of roles was accompanied by the transfer of a thousand pounds that no longer went to the governor of South Carolina but now went to his Georgian counterpart. James Glen stayed in England to protest this change and William Bull acted as governor in his stead. Dealings with Native Americans Governor Glen was noted for forging a 1755 treaty with the Cherokee, known as the Treaty of Saluda Old Town, in present-day Saluda County and the building of Fort Prince George near Keowee River. He was also responsible for promoting an official policy that aimed to create in Indians an \\"aversion\\" to African Americans in an attempt to thwart possible alliances between them.  King George's War  During King George's War, Governor Glen sent a trade delegation led by notable Indian trader and historian James Adair to win over Red Shoes (Choctaw chief) to abandon their alliance with the French and to side with the British. The efforts led to a great civil war amongst the Choctaw Nation. Adair blames the resulting failure on Glen for not supporting this mission.History of the American Indians by James Adair, pg 143-148.

Waukesha, 531 U.S. 278 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned the denial of a business license for an adult store which sold sexually explicit materials. The Court eventually dismissed the case as the store had withdrawn their application to renew their license. Background In Freeman v. Maryland the United States Supreme Court announced procedural requirements necessary to guard against unconstitutional prior restraint. Under this regime, the state of Wisconsin set up an administrative review process for reconsidering denials of licenses for adult stores. City News & Novelty, Inc., requested a renewal to operate their business in the city of Waukesha. Their application was denied. Wisconsin state courts upheld the denial and the store appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that they were not afforded proper judicial review of their matter before lower courts. The Supreme Court accepted the case to resolve a split amongst state and federal courts over how swift judicial review in these matters must be. Jeff Scott Olson, the attorney for the store, called the Supreme Court appeal important. According to Olson, \\"prompt judicial review\\" is important because municipal decisions on license matters can sometimes happen for a \\"distaste\\" of the particular business. Opinion of the Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the decision for a unanimous court, dismissing the case. The basis for the dismissal was that City News had withdrawn its renewal application entirely. This meant that there was no \\"cognizable interest in the outcome\\" of the case. While expressing a desire to resolve the important question in this case regarding judicial review of state censorship, there was no way for the matter to survive when there was no live controversy.

It is native to North America, where its main distribution lies along the coastline of the southeastern United States, including the Gulf Coast. It occurs from New Jersey to Texas, with outlying populations in Connecticut, New York, Mexico, and certain Caribbean islands.Uchytil, Ronald J. (1992). Juncus roemerianus. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Retrieved 1-2-2012. Description This rush is a perennial plant forming tufts of rough, rigid stems and leaves. It is gray-green in color. The plant may appear to be leafless at first glance, but what look like sharp-pointed stems are actually stiff leaves rolled tightly to form pointed cylinders. The true stems are tipped with inflorescences.Juncus roemerianus. University of Florida IFAS Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants. Retrieved 1-2-2012. It grows from a rhizome. This plant is variable in appearance. Its size and shape depend on environmental conditions in its salt marsh habitat. In areas with low soil salinity the plant can exceed two meters in height, whereas in high- salinity areas the rush is dwarfed, sometimes measuring under 30 centimeters (12 in.) tall. Both large and small plants generally occur in one marsh, with the large plants nearest the open water and the small plants occurring on higher ground in the salt flats and other areas of higher salinity. Plants of different sizes differ genetically, as well, with soil salinity being the selective force leading to the genetic variation. The dwarf plants have an adaptation to high soil salinity. Larger plants lack this adaptation, and do not survive when experimentally transplanted to high-salinity environments.Eleuterius, L. N. (1989). Natural selection and genetic adaptation to hypersalinity in Juncus roemerianus Scheele. Aquatic Botany 36(1) 45-53. Retrieved 1-2-2012. Reproduction The plant reproduces sexually by seed and vegetatively by sprouting from its spreading rhizome. It expands its dense, sometimes monotypic stands by sending up new stems from the rhizome, and establishes new stands by broadcasting seeds. The species is gynodioecious, with some plants having bisexual flowers and some having only female reproductive parts. The seeds are very viable, germinating readily, but they require light for germination and may fail to sprout if covered in thick mud. Therefore, seedlings are most often seen in open, sandy stretches, and rarely in areas with dense vegetation or thick substrates. The plant grows new shoots and leaves year-round, and does not typically experience seasonal growth spurts. Dead leaves remain on the plant for a long time, leading to an accumulation of plant matter. The species may form much of the physical structure of the marsh.Christian, R. R., et al. (1990). Juncus roemerianus production and decomposition along gradients of salinity and hydroperiod. Marine Ecology Progress Series 68 137-45. Retrieved 1-2-2012. Ecology This is a common and ecologically important plant in its range, often dominating salt marshes and estuaries. In northwestern Florida perhaps 60% of all the salt marshes are covered in this species of rush.

Other plants occurring in the higher-salinity regions of the marsh include saltmeadow cordgrass (S. patens), giant cordgrass (S. cynosuroides), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), glassworts (Salicornia spp.), Olney threesquare (Scirpus americanus), and saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus robustus). In the brackish marsh plant associates may include sealavender (Limonium carolinianum) and common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia). In the intermediate marsh between the brackish and freshwater marsh levels other plants include common reed (Phragmites australis), sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), softstem bulrush (Scirpus validus), and Virginia iris (Iris virginica). This rush provides cover for a number of salt marsh animal species. Birds such as the long-billed marsh wren, clapper rail, and seaside sparrow nest in it. Rice rats nest in it and prey on the eggs of the local birds. A number of fungal species grow on this rush, some exclusively. The new ascomycete species Aquamarina speciosa, Keissleriella rara, Massarina carolinensis, and Paraphaeosphaeria pilleata were described from dead or dying stems of this rush.Kohlmeyer, J., et al.

It was declared Endangered in 2016. The species's population had recently been in decline in the country while it slowly increases in reintroduction sites. The Turkmenian kulan has been reintroduced to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine, where the onagers formerly existed, also in Israel, where the subspecies are making hybrids with Persian onagers in the wild. Previously in 2005, the population was estimated at 1,295-1,345 in Turkmenistan. No other data existed on the condition of the Turkmenistan populations, but hope remained that small groups of animals still resided in inaccessible areas around Badkhyz, and were thriving in the West Kopetdagh (Sumbar-Chandyr Valley) and Ustyurt Plateau around Lake Sarakamish. However, certain fragmented populations of Transcaspian wild ass are currently on the rise to even more than 2,000 individuals in the wild. It is also estimated that over 6,000 kulans live in Central Asia. In 2017, there are 3,900 kulans in total roaming in Kazakhstan, of which the largest Kazakh population (3,400) reside in Altyn-Emel National Park. Physical description A Turkmenian kulan at Korkeasaari Zoo. The Turkmenian kulan is one of the largest subspecies of the onagers. It is 200‚Äì250 cm long, 100‚Äì140 cm tall at the shoulder, and it weighs 200‚Äì240 kg. Male onagers are larger than the females. The Transcaspian wild ass is characterized by a pale brown coat, a dark stripe down the spine and white patches on the sides, back and belly. It also has shaggy black mane and a tuft at the tail end. During the summer, the Turkmenian kulan's coat is leaner and brown, then it turns into thick grayish-brown winter coat during the cold season. Evolution Skull of a giant extinct horse, Equus eisenmannae The genus Equus, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from Dinohippus via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged Equus livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9‚Äì7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus E. (Asinus), including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (Dolichohippus), and E. (Hippotigris)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (Equus) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2‚Äì6.5) million years ago. Habitat and range The Turkmenian kulan lives in Central Asian deltas, hot and cold deserts or semi-deserts, steppes, arid grasslands and shrublands. The Turkmen specimen used to be the most widespread of the onagers, ranging from northernmost Iran and northern Afghanistan, the Transcaspian Oblast and western China to Ukraine and southern Siberia. It used to live in Saryesik-Atyrau Desert of Kazakhstan. However, it has gone extinct from that location. Diet and behavior The Turkmenian kulan are herbivorous mammals. They feed on herbs, shrubbery and plants. Most of their liquid comes from food, although often traveling at water sources, especially when breast- feeding their offspring. The mare lives with foals in small herds. The dominant stallion defends the surrounding areas to the water sources and tries to mate with any females that come close to drink. The mare, after a gestation period of about a year, gives birth to a single foal that stays with her mother for the first two years of life. The scorching heat of the Central Asian deserts makes the Transcaspian wild ass mostly active at dawn and dusk when temperatures are milder. The kulans, like most onagers, are one of the fastest land mammals and can run at high speed of 70 km/h. Threats Like all onagers, the Turkmenian kulan is threatened by poaching, hunting for their meat and their coat, habitat loss and relationships with apex predators such as Persian leopards, striped hyenas and mostly Himalayan wolves. Extinct predators like the Caspian tiger and Asiatic cheetah also preyed on the kulan. However, like other onagers, they have anti-predatory protections. Group of stallions can cooperate and chase off the predators. Conservation A Turkmenian kulan at Grodno Zoo, Belarus. In early 1919, the Soviet Union placed the Turkmenian kulan under protection. However, the measures enacted in their favor have not saved them from local extinctions, such as in Kazakhstan, where the subspecies disappeared in 1935. The main kulan population has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years. Badkhyz was the main stronghold and the last habitat of the Transcaspian wild ass which contained a few thousands of individuals, until it was reintroduced in other protected areas in Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries that was built purposely for the kulans, such as the Gapla≈àgyr Nature Reserve, the √áemenebit Sanctuary and the M√§ne-√á√§√ße Sanctuary. As of 1996-1997 the total population of Turkmenian kulan were estimated at between 500 and 700 kulans in Kazakhstan and about 6,000 kulans in Turkmenistan. Of the latter about 5,000 to 6,000 lived in Badkhyz Zapovednik alone and about 1,000 in artificially restored populations elsewhere in Turkmenistan. In Badkhyz, the Turkmenian kulan population has decreased from 6,000 individuals as of 1993 to 2,400 in 1998 and to 650 in 2002. Currently, there are 900 kulans in Badkhyz. Previously in 2005, there were more than 1,300 Turkmenian kulans in Turkmenistan (850-900 in Badhyz State Nature Reserve and another 445 in seven different reintroduction sites). Reintroduction projects After their local extinction in Kazakhstan in the 1930s, the kulan was reintroduced in four localities of Kazakhstan (where live about 900 specimens), and in Uzbekistan afterwards (34 specimens). The first reintroduction site of Turkmenian kulans in Kazakhstan was the Barsa- Kelmes Nature Reserve. Another 35 were reintroduced to the Aktau-Buzachinsky Sanctuary in 1991, which have grown to a population of more than 100 individuals on the Mangishlak Peninsula. Between 1986 and 1990, 105 Turmenian kulans were reintroduced to the Andasai Sanctuary, and have since increased to 200. In 1984, 32 kulans were reintroduced to the Kapchagai Game Area, which subsequently became the Altyn-Emel National Park (over 50,000,000 hectares in area), from southeastern Kazakhstan which consists of desert, between the Ili River and the Ak-Tau mountain range, near Lake Kapchagai. The previous census revealed that more than 700 individuals lived at Altyn-Emel. The population of Turkmenian kulan are on the rise, as that said small populations of Turkmenian kulan at Altyn-Emel increased to 2,000 as of 2012. The population has further increased to 3,400 kulans in Altyn-Emel as of 2017. In Kazakhstan, BirdLife partner, the ACBK (Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan) has recently started work on a project to establish a new kulan population in Central Asian steppe. On 24 October 2017, nine kulans were taken from Altyn-Emel and released to Altyn Dala protected area of the central Kazakh steppes. The reintroduction project aims to further move 30 or 40 kulans from Altyn Emel to the central steppes during the next 3 or 4 years. They are also released in Irgiz-Turgai. The Turkmenian kulans, along with the Przewalski's horse, have been reintroduced to the Askania-Nova Biosphere Reserve in southern Ukraine. In 2020, a herd of 20 kulans sourced from the Askania-Nova Biosphere Reserve were reintroduced to the Tarutyns'kyj steppe in southwestern Ukraine. In captivity The Turkmenian kulans are breeding in captivity in zoos, breeding centers and wildlife parks part of the American (SSP, AZA) and Eurasian (EEP, EAZA) captive breeding programs. There are over 1,000 Turkmenian kulans registered in the international studbook of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).

The case concerned whether the FDCA (Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act), a federal statute, pre-empted a state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claim. Although finding it on different grounds, the Court decided to reject the lawsuit attempt. Background The Plaintiffs' Legal Committee represented plaintiffs who claimed injuries resulting from the use of bone screws on their spines. They sued Buckman Company, alleging they made fraudulent representations to the FDA. They further argued that \\"but for\\" the false representations, the injuries would not have occurred. The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania heard these claims and decided to dismiss the \\"fraud-on-the-FDA\\" sections of the complaint on the ground that it was pre-empted by federal law. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, arguing that there was no express pre-emption. Buckman Company appealed to the Supreme Court which heard the case in December 2000. Opinion of the Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the decision of the Supreme Court, reversing the Third Circuit. He concluded that there was express pre-emption because holding these claims under state law would \\"inevitably conflict\\" with the FDA's duty to police fraud. Additionally, to allow such suits could potentially chill information provided to the FDA, a concern the Court thought would hamper the FDA's evaluation of applications. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurring opinion in the judgement of the Court, which Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Thus, they agreed with reversing the Third Circuit, but on different grounds. Stevens said the lawsuit could not proceed because the plaintiffs could not rebut the fact that the FDA did not remove the allegedly defective products from the market. Therefore, there was no \\"but for\\" causation in the first instance.

It is California Historical Landmark #927. The temple was constructed from local redwood in the mid-19th century and served what was once a large population of Chinese immigrants who worked in or supported the lumber industry in Mendocino, including survivors from a fleet of Chinese junks that sailed to California for the gold rush and landed instead on the Mendocino coast. The temple's ownership was passed down through Chinese families until, in 1995, a nonprofit organization was formed to restore and maintain the temple. It continues to be used both as a house of worship and to educate visitors about the history of Chinese Americans. It is one of the oldest continuously used Chinese temples in California, the only remaining joss house on the northern California coast, and the only remaining building from the Chinese community in Mendocino. Description The Temple of Kwan Tai is a small brightly painted red and green redwood building with two doors, three windows, and a gable roof, located at 45160 Albion St in Mendocino, facing south toward the Pacific Ocean. Nine steps lead from the street level to the front door, a number that \\"is said to fend off evil spirits\\".. The name of the temple is written over the door, in Chinese characters pronounced in Cantonese as \\"Mo Dai Miu\\" or \\"Military God-king Temple\\". The main room of the temple is approximately in area; a small room at the rear of the building, originally the temple keeper's quarters, is now used as an office. The temple is dedicated to the deified Han Dynasty general known in Cantonese as Kwan Tai (or Guan Di in Mandarin) and holds in its main altar an image of Kwan Tai flanked by generals Liu Bei and Zhang Fei, decorated in shell and glass on a black fabric background. A table in front of the altar holds five pewter altarpieces. Signboards recording prayers and donations are displayed on the temple walls, a collection of flags, drums, and baskets stands to the left of the altar, and the room also holds two wooden benches and a furnace for burning offerings. Taoist mandalas hang in the two front windows.. Construction and initial usage Like the other settlers in Mendocino County, Chinese laborers came to the area to work in the lumber industry. In one incident in 1854, a Chinese junk landed at Caspar, just north of Mendocino, one of two surviving ships from a fleet of seven that had sailed to California.. One of the passengers on this ship, Joe Lee or Chong Sung, was one of the builders of the temple, and his descendants continue to maintain it and worship there.. Over the next few decades, Mendocino had a substantial population of 500 to 700 Chinese immigrants, who worked there as cooks, servants, and shopkeepers, as well as working in the lumber industry as water slingers (people who kept the trails wet so that the cut logs could slide more easily). Chinese farmers also grew fruit and vegetables for local consumption in gardens now located on the grounds of the Stanford Inn, and gathered and processed seaweed for export back to China., pp. 38, 45‚Äì47, 49. Some of the descendants of these immigrants, such as Look Tin Eli and his brother Lee Eli, became successful and wealthy businessmen. An oral account by Mendocino resident George Hee (a grandson of one of its builders) states that the temple was originally built in 1854; however, other sources date it to 1852 or 1867,. 43-page booklet available for sale at the Gallery Bookstore, Mendocino. and the earliest record of it is an insurance company map from 1883. Its original building materials cost only US$14. It was enlarged in the 1870s, and at that time had a full-time priest; it was open at all hours to the Chinese population, but Caucasians were not permitted entry. Inheritance and restoration The temple ownership was passed down from Hee's grandfather to his mother, Yip Lee; she had ten sons, and in turn passed the ownership to Hee despite the return of her husband to China. Mendocino's Chinatown burned down in 1910, and over the years, the other Chinese left the area until only Hee was left. He married a Caucasian woman in the early 1940s, defying anti-miscegenation laws in California that remained in force until the 1948 court decision Perez v. Sharp, and in turn passed the property to his two daughters, Loretta Hee McCoard and Lorraine Hee-Chorley. In 1995, they donated it to the Temple of Kwan Tai, Inc., a nonprofit corporation formed to maintain it. The Temple of Kwan Tai is now the only remaining joss house on the northern California coast.Mendocino Joss House (Temple of Kwan Tai), Asian- Pacific Heritage Month, National Register of Historic Places, 2002, accessed 2011-12-25.

The building was restored beginning in 1998 and 1999, under the guidance of architect Laura Culberson and with funding from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the California Coastal Resources Agency.. Also printed with minor revisions as \\"Temple Honors Legacy Of Chinese in California; 19th Century Immigrants Used Site\\" in the Washington Post, March 24, 2002. These restorations included the replacement of the foundations, east wall, and floor of the building, the addition of insulation, and repainting, the placement of a commemorative plaque noting its status as a historic landmark, and the replacement of the original silk-screened canvas altarpiece (damaged during the restoration process) by a replica purchased in Chinatown, San Francisco. The temple was rededicated in October 2001 in a religious and cultural ceremony featuring a parade, a lion dance, martial arts exhibitions, and attendance by Buddhist nuns from the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas as well as local politicians.. It received the National Preservation Honor Award of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2002. Activity The Temple of Kwan Tai is one of the oldest Chinese temples in California that has been used continuously since its construction.California Historical Landmarks in Mendocino County, accessed 2011-12-25. Other 1850s-era Chinese temples in California include the Weaverville Joss House, San Francisco's Tin How Temple, and the Bok Kai Temple in Marysville. The temple is used for traditional Chinese rituals in which the officiant kneels and bows at the altar, placing offerings at the table in front of the altar or burning them in the furnace. Offerings of food are made on the first and 15th day of each month and at the new moon, and incense is burned daily. Additionally, the temple may be used for divination by kau cim sticks and jiaobei blocks. As well as continuing to serve as a house of worship, the temple has a mission of educating members of the Mendocino community and visitors about Chinese contributions to California history.

It includes the genera Cistecephalus, Cistecephaloides, and Kawingasaurus. Cistecephalids are thought to have had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, with adaptations such as broad skulls, strong forelimbs, and squat bodies. A similar group of dicynodonts called the pylaecephalids were also fossorial, although to a lesser extent than cistecephalids. Cistecephalids showed a high level of endemism, with each of the five known species unique to a single region. Description Cistecephalids were small dicynodonts. Most species, with the exception of Kembawacela, lacked tusks, but sexually dimorphic supraorbital ridges were present. Cistecephalids had boxy, broad skulls with relatively laterally directed temporal openings, a result of a considerably broadened intertemporal region. Sauroscaptor, the most basal genus of the family, had a less extreme broadening of the intratemporal region than in other members of the family. In the derived genera Cistecephaloides and Kawingasaurus, the intratemporal portion of the skull was broader than the skull was long. Cistecephalids also had a relatively posteriorly positioned pineal foramen, which in Kembawacela and Sauroscaptor was displaced all the way to the posterior margin of the skull. They also had anteriorly directed orbits; they may have had binocular vision, which may have been an adaptation for nocturnality or an insectivorous lifestyle.

Its name reflects four schools founded and merged in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida by the Women's Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church to educate former slaves and their descendants. Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy closed in 1983. Among its graduates/students were U.S. Congressman James E. Clyburn (D-SC), major league baseball pioneer Larry Doby, businessman E. Perry Palmer, childcare advocate Frieda Mitchell, \\"Dean of the CIAA\\" coach Eddie C. McGirt, and civil rights attorney John Roy Harper II. History Boylan School Founded in 1886 in Jacksonville, Florida, the school was named for a benefactor, Ann Boylan DeGroot, treasurer of the Newark Conference. She‚Äôd hoped to atone for, and change the image of, her family, which had operated two large plantations. In 1901, the school established a nurse training department, which later became Brewster Hospital ‚Äì the first for African Americans in Jacksonville. Haven Industrial Home and School Founded in 1885 in Savannah, Georgia, the school was named for Bishop Gilbert Haven, based on an earlier school founded by Mrs. S.M. Lewis and Mrs. M.C. Bristol of the Atlanta Mission. It lasted until 1932, when its isolated location, low student enrollment and poor facilities resulted in a merger with the Boylan School. Boylan-Haven School Created in 1932 in Jacksonville, this was the merger of the Boylan and Haven schools. Mather Academy Founded in 1887 in Camden, this was the brainchild of Sarah Babcock, a Plymouth, Massachusetts teacher who'd opened a short-lived Freedmen's Bureau school in 1867 before purchasing the 27-acre Thomas Lang plantation. When she became corresponding secretary of the New England Southern Conference, she urged the group to establish a girls' school on the property. The school was named Browning Model Home and Industrial School in honor of benefactor Fanny O. Browning. In 1890, it enrolled its first male students, and the Conference purchased the land from Babcock, who'd married Rev. James Mather. In 1900, at Babcock Mather's request, Browning Home was renamed Mather Academy in honor of her husband. Mather Academy expanded its curriculum over the years, offering grade levels from kindergarten through high school, and accepting applicants from across the nation. In 1928, it was one of the first S.C. schools for African Americans to offer a 12th grade. In 1934, Mather's high quality of education earned it a Class A school rating‚Äîa distinction held at the time by only three other schools in the state. The combination of black students co- existing peaceably and equally with white teachers and administrators during segregation made Mather an \\"oasis\\" of race relations. A gymnasium and auditorium in the administration building/girls' dormitory were the preferred sites in the region for many sporting events, concerts, pageants and plays. The Christmas Pageant attracted a large cross-section of the Camden community. Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy In 1959, the Women‚Äôs Division of Christian Service of the Methodist Board of Missions closed the Boylan-Haven School in Florida and merged it with Mather Academy in Camden to economize finances. In 1983, the Methodist Women's Division, part of the General Board of Global Ministries, closed Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy because of the Board's new mission priorities, rising costs, and the school's declining enrollment brought on by factors such as integration and increased educational opportunities in the public sector. The Women's Division ordered the buildings torn down in 1995 and began selling the land. A memorial site and historical marker in Camden identify the school‚Äôs former location.

The script was written by de la Iglesia, Rafael S√°nchez Campoy and Gonzalo Goicoechea with the working title La acera de enfrente (literally: The other side of the street, which was used as a pejorative expression for \\"homosexual\\"), considered too daring for its time, the title was changed upon release.Smith, Laws of Desire, p. 137 The film stars Sim√≥n Andreu, Charo L√≥pez and Tony Fuentes. The plot follows a middle-aged, closeted homosexual banker from a wealthy family, who falls in love with a much younger heterosexual man. Los placeres ocultos is notable for being the first extended representation of gay men in Spanish cinema.Smith, Laws of Desire, p. 129  Plot  Eduardo, a well off bank manager in his forties, is a sophisticated closeted homosexual. He keeps his sexual life a secret, but he uses his social and economic position to win over young men. In one of his regular cruising sessions in the University area, Eduardo meets Miguel, an attractive young man from a humble background and falls in love with him. Then Eduardo starts his usual plan to approach men. Through Nes, a gay man who lives in Miguel's neighborhood, Eduardo finds out Miguel's address and offers him a job in the company run by his friend Raul. Raul and Eduardo had a relationship in the past and Raul is still secretly in love with Eduardo. With the excuse of helping him typing a book, Eduardo takes Miguel to his apartment every afternoon. To gain his friendship, Eduardo buys him a motorcycle. However, Miguel is heterosexual. He has a steady girlfriend, Carmen. Miguel is also entangled in a sexual affair with Rosa, an older married neighbor who he visits with excuse of helping her with plumbing problems in her house. When Eduardo tells his fellings to his new friend, Miguel rejects him. Eduardo returns to his solitary life looking for fleeting pleasures with young men in cruising spots: cinemas, parks and public toilets. He rejects the offer of his friend Raul to be involved in the emerging gay movement. Then, Eduardo's elderly mother becomes terminally ill and in her deathbed, she confesses that she had known he was gay since he was a teenager. She urges him not to be alone. In one of his adventures cruising in the park, Eduardo meets Nes again. Nes and members of his gang go to Eduardo's apartment to rob him and beat him. When Miguel finds out what had happened, he worries about Eduardo and beats Nes in revenge. As a result, Eduardo and Miguel resume their friendship. This time, they accept each other and Eduardo respects that Miguel is straight. Miguel introduces his girlfriend Carmen to Eduardo and the trio establish a close relationship. For Eduardo, the company of the young couple fills the void of a family life and eases his loneliness. The close friendship between Eduardo and the couple formed by Miguel and Carmen is abruptly truncated by Rosa's reappearance. Rosa, angry because she was jilted by Miguel, maliciously begin to spread rumors that Miguel is gay. She talks to Carmen's father and, as a consequence, he forbids his daughter to see Miguel again. Miguel becomes very upset with the loss of his girlfriend, blaming his closeness to Eduardo for it. Hurt and enraged, Miguel goes to the bank where Eduardo works and makes a terrible scene, shouting, insulting, and revealing Eduardo's homosexuality to all. In the last scene Eduardo is alone in his apartment and hears the rings of the doorbell. He looks through the peephole and his face lights up with joy. When the door is ajar the film ends without seeing the visitor.

The review in El Pueblo stated that the film treats the \\"sad problem of homosexuality, but with Little scandal\\". On opening night in Madrid, the film was met with massive street demonstrations by gay liberationists, with de la Iglesia recalling that, \\" It was the first time a Spanish gay group came out in public, with its banners and presenting its demands.\\"Murray, Images in the Dark, p. 40 Notes   References  *Murray, Raymond.

The darkly comic story takes place in Oregon and California in 1851. The narrator, Eli Sisters, and his brother Charlie are assassins tasked with killing Hermann Kermit Warm, an ingenious prospector who has been accused of stealing from the Sisters' fearsome boss, the Commodore. Eli and Charlie experience a series of misadventures while tracking down Warm which resemble the narrative form of a picaresque novel, and the chapters are, according to one review, \\"slightly sketched-in, dangerously close to a film treatment.\\" The film rights for the novel were sold to actor John C. Reilly's production company and adapted into a 2018 film of the same name, with Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix playing Eli and Charlie, respectively.http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/05/27/book-review-the-sisters- brothers-by-patrick-dewitt/ and https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts- post/post/patrick-dewitts-the-sisters-brothers-wins-governor-generals-award- in-canada/2011/11/15/gIQArjMARN_blog.html Plot summary In 1851, Eli and Charlie Sisters, a pair of assassins of minor repute, are hired by a wealthy businessman known only as \\"the Commodore\\" to travel from Oregon City to California in order to murder a gold rush prospector named Hermann Kermit Warm, who is described to them as a \\"thief\\". Hard-nosed, plainspoken Charlie, more impulsive and aggressive than his younger brother Eli, has a fondness for binge drinking and appears remorseless about the crimes he commits. Eli, contemplative and often sentimental, admires and looks up to Charlie but finds himself at odds with Charlie's apparent nonchalance about the directions their lives are taking. The brothers bicker constantly about money, the job, their horses, and each other's personalities. As they ride south, Eli and Charlie encounter many strange characters and endure a series of mishaps and adventures. Eli is first bitten by a spider and then must have a tooth removed, for which he is given morphine to numb the pain; his horse is attacked by a grizzly bear but survives despite a serious eye injury. Charlie frequently gets drunk and is too sick to ride the following morning, slowing their progress to California, which frustrates Eli. The pair hears rumors on the trail about a female bear with a uniquely red-colored pelt, for which a hefty reward has been offered by a man named Mayfield. Entering California, the brothers unexpectedly spot the bear and Charlie kills it, and they decide to bring it to Mayfield, who runs an inn in a town named after him. After being paid, Charlie insists they stay a night in Mayfield's hotel; Eli sleeps with the hotel's bookkeeper. Waking the next morning, they discover the red bear pelt is missing and suspect Mayfield will accuse them of stealing it. The brothers sneak to the stable to retrieve their horses and flee town, but a group of surly fur trappers who work for Mayfield stop them and demand they return the cash they were paid for the pelt. Charlie and Eli simultaneously dispatch these enemies with well-placed gunshots, and Charlie feels compelled to kill an innocent stable boy to eliminate eyewitnesses. Returning to the hotel, they find that Mayfield has fled. The brothers steal his enormous cache of gold bullion and hide it behind the hotel's stove for safekeeping while they leave to finish their business with Hermann Warm. Eli and Charlie reach San Francisco and seek out an acquaintance named Morris, whom the Commodore had instructed to keep track of Warm until the Sisters brothers arrived. Morris has disappeared, though, and the brothers must coerce the proprietor of his hotel to hand over Morris' journal. The journal reveals that Morris was approached by Warm, who has concocted an ingenious chemical formula that causes gold to glow brilliantly, making it highly useful for indicating the location of placer deposits in riverbeds. Warm demonstrated his formula to Morris and offered him a partnership in it, and the two have since teamed up to travel to the \\"River of Light\\", where they hope to test large quantities of it. Eli and Charlie realize then that the Commodore has duped them: Warm is not a thief but had simply refused to share his formula with the Commodore. Though Charlie wants to see the job done as intended, Eli hesitates to murder an innocent man, but they eventually agree to ride out to Warm's claim and finish the job, which Eli vows will be his last for the Commodore. When they finally track Morris and Warm to their camp along a remote river, Warm at first catches them off-guard, knowing they were sent to kill him. But the prospectors do not retaliate, and Eli and Charlie likewise earn Warm's trust by defending the camp from a gang of curious bandits. Soon the four men decide to join forces in the prospecting operation. Warm's gold-finding formula, however, proves severely caustic, and both Morris and Warm are already suffering burns to their skin from having exposed their legs to the chemical while wading in the contaminated river. The four partners wait for nightfall to pour the formula into the river and collect as many illuminated gold fragments as possible before the glow fades away. Charlie spills some of the raw formula on his shooting hand and finds it too painful to use, but the men manage to extract a fortune in gold from the riverbed. Morris then falls into the river and Warm dives in to rescue him; both men are severely burned and die from exposure the following day. While the brothers wait for Warm to die so he can be given a proper burial, a party of Indians stumbles upon the camp and robs the men of their money and the gold they had collected. Eli realizes that no one but Warm knew how to make the formula. The Sisters brothers slowly make their way back to Oregon City, stopping in Mayfield on the way, only to discover the entire town burned down and the gold bullion they had hidden there missing. Mayfield's whores gang up on the brothers and rob them of their little remaining money and pistols. Charlie's burned hand is eventually amputated, and Eli nurses him back to health. Profoundly distressed by the experience, Charlie's former confidence and fearlessness are now gone. Eli, too, is uncertain what to do with himself, but sets out first to break the endless cycle of killers hired by the Commodore by killing him instead. He finds the Commodore soliloquizing in a bathtub in his mansion and drowns him. Now free of their life of crime, the brothers return to their mother's house, who welcomes them to stay.

The war lasted from 1923 until 1932,Nina Consuelo Epton, Oasis Kingdom: The Libyan Story (New York: Roy Publishers, 1953), p. 126. when the principal Senussi leader, Omar al-Mukhtar, was captured and executed.Detailed description of some fights (in Italian) Fighting took place in all three of Libya's provinces (Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica), but was most intense and prolonged in the mountainous Jebel Akhdar region of Cyrenaica.The Second Italo-Senussi War http://countrystudies.us/libya/21.htm retrvd 2-1-20 The war led to the mass deaths of the indigenous people of Cyrenaica, totalling one quarter of the region's population of 225,000. Italian war crimes included the use of chemical weapons, execution of surrendering combatants, and the mass killing of civilians, while the Senussis were accused of torture and mutilation of captured Italians and refusal to take prisoners since the late 1910s.Gaston Leroud, Matin Journal edition August 23, 1917 Italian authorities forcibly expelled 100,000 Bedouin Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica, from their settlements, many of which were then given to Italian settlers. Background Italy had seized military control of Libya from the Ottoman Empire during the Italo-Turkish War in 1912Antonio De Martino.Tripoli italiana Societa Libraria italiana (Library of Congress). New York, 1911 , but the new colony had swiftly revolted, transferring large swaths of territory to local Libyan rule. Conflict between Italy and the Senussis a Muslim political- religious tariqa based in Libya erupted into major violence during World War I, when Senussis in Libya began collaborating with the Ottomans against Italian troops. The Libyan Senussis also escalated the conflict with attacks on British forces in Egypt.Ian F. W. Beckett. The Great War: 1914-1918. Routledge, 2013. P188. Warfare between the British and the Senussis continued until 1917.Adrian Gilbert. Encyclopedia of Warfare: From the Earliest Times to the Present Day. Routledge, 2000. P221. In 1917, an exhausted Italy signed the Treaty of Acroma, which acknowledged the effective independence of Libya from Italian control.Melvin E. Page. Colonialism. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. P749. In 1918, Tripolitanian rebels founded the Tripolitanian Republic, though the rest of the country remained under nominal Italian rule. Local resistance against Italy continued, such that by 1920, the Italian government was forced to recognize Senussi leader Sayid Idris as Emir of Cyrenaica and grant him autonomy. In 1922, Tripolitanian leaders offered Idris the position of Emir of Tripolitania; however, before Idris could accept the position, the new Italian government of Benito Mussolini initiated a campaign of reconquest. Since 1911, claims had been made of massacres of Italian soldiers and civilians by Turkish and local Muslim guerrillas, such as a slaughter in Sciara Sciat:Italo-turkish war: Sciara Sciat and the massacre of Italians Reports of these massacres led to cries for retaliation and revenge in Italy, and in the early 1920s the rise to power of Benito Mussolini, leader of the National Fascist Party, as Prime Minister of Italy led to a much more aggressive approach to foreign policy. Given the importance that the Fascists gave to Libya as part of a new Italian Empire, this incident served as a useful pretext for large-scale military action to reclaim it. The War The war began with Italian forces rapidly occupying the Sirte desert separating Tripolitania from Cyrenaica. Using aircraft, motor transport, and good logistical organization, the Italians were able to occupy of territory in five months, cutting off the physical connection formerly held by the rebels between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. By late 1928, the Italians had taken control of Ghibla, and its tribes were disarmed. From 1923 to 1924, Italian troops regained all territory north of the Ghadames-Mizda-Beni Ulid region, with four-fifths of the estimated population of Tripolitania and Fezzan within the Italian area. In this period they also regained the northern lowlands of Cyrenaica, but attempts to occupy the forested hills of Jebel Akhtar were met with strong guerrilla resistance, led by Senussi sheikh Omar Mukhtar. Attempted negotiations between Italy and Omar Mukhtar broke down and Italy then planned for the complete conquest of Libya. In 1930, Italian forces conquered Fezzan and raised the Italian flag in Tummo, the southernmost region of Fezzan. On 20 June 1930, Pietro Badoglio wrote to General Graziani: \\"As for overall strategy, it is necessary to create a significant and clear separation between the controlled population and the rebel formations. I do not hide the significance and seriousness of this measure, which might be the ruin of the subdued population...But now the course has been set, and we must carry it out to the end, even if the entire population of Cyrenaica must perish\\". By 1931, well over half the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps where many died as result of overcrowding in combination with a lack of water, food and medicine while Badoglio had the Air Force use chemical warfare against the Bedouin rebels in the desert. Inmates at the El Agheila concentration camp. 12,000 Cyrenaicans were executed in 1931 and all the nomadic peoples of northern Cyrenaica were forcefully removed from the region and relocated to huge concentration camps in the Cyrenaican lowlands. Italian military authorities carried out the forced migration and deportation of the entire population of Jebel Akhdar in Cyrenaica, resulting in 100,000 Bedouins, half the population of Cyrenaica, being expelled from their settlements. These 100,000 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were forced by Italian authorities to march across the desert to a series of barbed-wire concentration camp compounds erected near Benghazi, while stragglers who could not keep up with the march were shot by Italian authorities. Propaganda by the Fascist regime declared the camps to be oases of modern civilization that were hygienic and efficiently run - however in reality the camps had poor sanitary conditions as the camps had an average of about 20,000 Bedouins together with their camels and other animals, crowded into an area of . The camps held only rudimentary medical services, with the camps of Soluch and Sisi Ahmed el Magrun with 33,000 internees each having only one doctor between them. Typhus and other diseases spread rapidly in the camps as the people were physically weakened due to meagre food rations and forced labour. By the time the camps closed in September 1933, 40,000 of the 100,000 total internees had already died in the camps. The Fiat 3000 light tank used by Italian forces during the campaign.David Miller, Chris Foss. Great Book of Tanks: The World's Most Important Tanks from World War I to the Present Day. Zenith Imprint, 2003. p. 83. To close rebel supply routes from Egypt, the Italians constructed a barbed wire fence on the border with Egypt that was patrolled by armoured cars and aircraft. The Italians persecuted the Senussi Order; zawias and mosques were closed, Senussi practices were forbidden, Senussi estates were confiscated, and preparations were made for Italian conquest of the Kufra Oasis, the last stronghold of the Senussi in Libya. In 1931, Italian forces seized Kufra where Senussi refugees were bombed and strafed by Italian aircraft as they fled into the desert. Mukhtar was captured by the Italians in 1931, followed by a court martial and his public execution by hanging at Suluq. Mukhtar's death effectively ended the resistance, and in January 1932, Badoglio proclaimed the end of the campaign. Takeover of Kufra The Frankfurter Zeitung reporter and author Muhammad Asad interviewed a man from Kufra after its seizure by the Italians in his book The Road to Mecca. War crimes Specific war crimes committed by the Italian armed forces against civilians include deliberate bombing of civilians, killing unarmed children, women, and the elderly, rape and disembowelment of women, throwing prisoners out of aircraft to their death and running over others with tanks, regular daily executions of civilians in some areas, and bombing tribal villages with mustard gas bombs beginning in 1930.Geoff Simons, Tam Dalyell (British Member of Parliament, forward introduction).

Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's ruler at the time, attended the signing ceremony wearing a historical photograph on his uniform that showed Cyrenaican rebel leader Omar Mukhtar in chains after being captured by Italian authorities during the war. At the ceremony, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi declared: \\"In this historic document, Italy apologizes for its killing, destruction and repression of the Libyan people during the period of colonial rule.\\" He went on to say that this was a \\"complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on Libya by Italy during the colonial era.\\" These declarations received harsh criticism from the Associazione Rifugiati Italiani dalla Libia and from some Italian historians, who felt the agreement was \\"based on false assumptions created by Gaddafi propaganda\\".Critics to Berlusconi apologies (in Italian) Film portrayals The 1981 film Lion of the Desert by Moustapha Akkad is about this conflict.

Meetings were held in assembly or classrooms of the school. In 1881, the society reorganized as the Students' Christian Association, and they were granted a room in the campus conservatory building as a meeting place. However, in 1891, the room was required for classes, and the Association was homeless. They soon decided to gather funds to erect a new building. By early 1892, nearly $1000 had been pledged, and the Association appealed to philanthropist Mary Ann Starkweather for additional funding. She agreed to bequeath an additional $10,000 for the purpose of constructing a building; the funds were disbursed in late 1895. Detroit architects Malcomson and Higginbotham were hired to design the building, and it was constructed in 1896 at a cost of slightly over $11,000. The Starkweather Religious Center was dedicated on March 26, 1897. When it was constructed, it was the only religious center at any teacher's college in the United States. After construction, it was leased to the University's Students' Christian Association. The Students' Christian Association was disbanded in the 1920s, but Starkweather Hall continued to be used by a succession of religious organizations. The building was renovated in 1961 by Jinkling and Lyman of Birmingham, Michigan. In 1976, the Office of Religious, which used the building at that point, was closed. The building was again remodeled, and used by public relations services. As of 2013, it is used by the Graduate Office. Description Starkweather Hall, c. 1910 Starkweather Hall is a two-story Richardsonian Romanesque structure built of squared fieldstone, covering approximately by . It is asymmetrical, with an octagonal sandstone tower on one corner and a gable over the front entrance. Fishscale orange tile covers the top halves of the other facades. On the interior, the first floor originally contained dining/reception rooms, a kitchen, a dressing room, a library, and a few classrooms. The rooms were delineated by partitions that could be rolled open to create a larger space. The second floor originally contained a large assembly room and a caretaker's room. Hardware was designed especially for the building, and some original doorknobs, marked \\"SCA,\\" still remain.
