Egypt has an embassy in Pyongyang whilst North Korea has an embassy in Cairo. History Relations have remained fairly strong since the time of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Non-Aligned Movement, when North Korea strongly supported Nasser's decision to nationalise the Suez Canal. During the Suez Crisis, on 3 November 1956, the DPRK issued a declaration of solidarity with Egypt, and sent a small amount of financial aid (60.000 won) in the aftermath of the invasion.Barry K. Gills, Korea versus Korea: A Case of Contested Legitimacy (London: Routledge, 1996), 64. In 1957 and 1958, the two governments signed a trade agreement and a cultural cooperation agreement, respectively.Chung-in Moon, \\"Between Ideology and Interest: North Korea in the Middle East,\\" in Jae Kyu Park, Byung Chul Koh and Tae-Hwan Kwak, eds., The Foreign Relations of North Korea: New Perspectives (Colorado: Westview Press; Seoul: Kyungnam University Press, 1987), 385. A North Korean diplomatic delegation was sent to Egypt in 1961 for the purpose of establishing consular relations. On 24 August 1963, the two governments elevated their diplomatic relations to the ambassadorial level.Moon, \\"Between Ideology and Interest,\\" 383. During the annual UN General Assembly debates over the Korean problem, Egypt initially abstained on the question of whether both Koreas or only the Republic of Korea should be invited to participate in the UN discussions. On 11 December 1962, Egypt, for the first time, voted in favor of a Soviet draft resolution on inviting both Koreas; this step was probably a reaction to the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and South Korea (9 April 1962). Nevertheless, in 1962-1966 Egypt still refrained from rejecting the U.S.-sponsored UN resolutions on Korea; instead, it preferred to abstain from voting.Balazs Szalontai, \\"Courting the 'Traitor to the Arab Cause': Egyptian-North Korean Relations in the Sadat Era, 1970-1981,‚Äù S/N Korean Humanities, 5:1 (March 2019), 106-107. In the aftermath of the Six-Day War, North Korea provided Egypt with food aid (5.000 tons of cereals). Egypt, on its part, switched to a consistently pro-DPRK position in the UN. At that time, this shift reflected Nasser's growing dependence on Soviet assistance, but the Egyptian government maintained cordial relations with the DPRK even after Nasser's successor, Anwar Sadat, broke with the USSR in favor of a partnership with the U.S. In 1973‚Äì1976, Egypt continued to side with North Korea in the UN and the Non-Aligned Movement, whereas the DPRK expressed agreement with the Sinai Interim Agreement, the abrogation of the Egyptian- Soviet treaty of friendship (14 March 1976), Sadat's visit in Jerusalem (19‚Äì21 November 1977), and the Camp David Accords.Szalontai, \\"Courting the 'Traitor to the Arab Cause',\\" 107-126. In 2015, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el- Sisi, who has refused to enforce United Nations sanctions against North Korea, invited North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to attend the reopening of the reworked Suez Canal; Kim Yong-nam attended in his place. Military During the visit of a North Korean government delegation headed by Kang Ryang-uk (1-7 March 1973), Egyptian Chief of Staff Saad el-Shazly asked the delegates to dispatch DPRK troops to train Egyptian pilots. On April 6-13, Shazly visited the DPRK, and gained the consent of Kim Il-sung. The North Korean trainers (20 pilots and 18 other staff members) arrived in June, and were assigned in July. On October 18, after the outbreak the Yom Kippur War, Kim Il-sung sent Egypt and 16 other Arab states a message of solidarity.Satoru Miyamoto, \\"DPRK Troop Dispatches and Military Support in the Middle East: Change from Military Support to Arms Trade in the 1970s.‚Äù East Asia 27 (2010): 345-359. However, during the Libyan‚ÄìEgyptian War in July 1977, North Korea sided with Libya. President Anwar el-Sadat approved the sale of R-17 Elbrus missiles to North Korea between 1976 and 1981. North Korea has also helped Egypt develop its own missile systems. North Korea obtained its first Scud-B ballistic missiles from Egypt in 1979 or 1980, whereas in the 1990s, Egypt purchased Scud-C missiles from North Korea. Port Said has served as a transshipment port for North Korea weapon exports to Africa. The United Nations reported in 2016 that a North Korean freighter containing some 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades worth an estimated $26 million had been intercepted off the coast of Egypt; the RPGs were allegedly purchased by the Egypt-based Arab Organization for Industrialization overseen by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In 2017, following a visit to South Korea, Egyptian Defense Minister Sedki Sobhi reportedly announced that Egypt had \\"severed all military ties with North Korea\\", after the US slashed some $291 million worth of aid to Egypt. Economic relations Egypt is one of North Korea's biggest trading partners. As of 2010, Egypt is the third-largest importer of North Korean goods, after China and South Korea, and also ranks among the top five exporters to North Korea. The Egyptian telecommunications company Orascom was critical to the establishment of Koryolink in 2008, creating North Korea's only 3G phone network. Orascom also became the first non-North Korean company to own a telecom license in North Korea.

History The original site for what became Clarence Barracks was the early 17th-century King's Cooperage in Old Portsmouth, owned and operated by the Victualling Commissioners. Rebuilt in 1723, it consisted of a long narrow courtyard surrounded by workshops, seasoning sheds, offices and storehouses; a new well was dug and a rainwater cistern erected to provide reliable sources of water. It stood on the town's south-eastern edge, with St Nicholas Street on one side and the line of fortifications on the other. Royal Marine Barracks, Portsmouth In 1753 the Cooperage relocated to the Weevil on the Gosport side of the harbour; whereupon the Navy Board began making plans to convert the old buildings into a barracksPainting: Old Clarence Barracks, 1847. for the newly-constituted Portsmouth Division of the Royal Marines. Accommodation was provided for about a quarter of the Division (which numbered 2,200 men plus officers, two-thirds of whom were expected to be at sea at any one time): eight rooms were set aside for the officers, and forty-five rooms for the men (who slept two to a bed, twelve in each room); each room was also furnished with two dining tables, twelve stools and kit-lockers. In 1823-4 the barracks were extended into an adjacent parcel of land previously known as the Shot Locker. The barracks were renamed Clarence Barracks after the Duke of Clarence who visited the site to present colours to the Royal Marines Light Infantry in 1827. By the 1840s the Marines were outgrowing this accommodation, and an arrangement was made whereby the Admiralty exchanged Clarence Barracks for the Army's Forton Barracks, near Gosport. In 1848 the Portsmouth Division of the Royal Marines Light Infantry moved into their new accommodation in Forton, and the Army took possession of Clarence Barracks. Ten years later, however, Clarence was condemned by the Army Sanitary Commission as 'quite unfit for habitation', which cited (among other shortcomings) the close proximity of the privies to the cook-house. Fourhouse Barracks Immediately to the south of the King's Cooperage stood the Tudor King's Beerhouses (or Brewery) on what was known as Four House Green. In the 17th century they had been sold into private hands and were subsequently closed. For a time quarters for Invalid soldiers stood on the site, until barrack accommodation for around a thousand infantry was built there in 1760; this was known as Fourhouse Barracks. Later, when both Forehouse and Clarence were in Army hands, the two together were sometimes known as Clarence BarracksMap, 1890. (in the 1860s several properties in St Nicholas Street had been purchased by the War Office 'so as to unite the Clarence, Cambridge and Fourhouse Barracks'). New Clarence Barracks Parade ground at the new Clarence Barracks, 1899. In the 1880s the old ramparts were levelled and the opportunity was taken in 1890 to demolish the old Clarence/Fourhouse barracks and build a 'spectacular' new complex of buildings (on a much larger scale, since they were no longer hemmed in behind fortifications). The new Clarence Barracks housed six garrison battalions of the Royal Artillery, while nearby Victoria Barracks (begun ten years earlier) contained a regiment of Infantry. A large parade ground was created and new officers' quarters were added in 1893. Later, when the north (officers') range of the adjacent Cambridge Barracks was purchased by Portsmouth Grammar School, the south (soldiers') range was incorporated into Clarence Barracks (it was later itself purchased by the school). The barracks suffered a significant amount of bomb damage in the Second World War. In March 1948 they were converted for use by the Women's Royal Naval Service and renamed the Duchess of Kent Barracks (after the Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, who was Duchess of Kent and Commandant of the Service). The barracks began to be decommissioned in the early 1960s. From 1966 senior and junior WRNS ratings were temporarily accommodated in the Wardroom of the Naval Barracks (HMS Victory, later renamed HMS Nelson) to allow the Duchess of Kent Barracks to be vacated, while new permanent quarters were constructed for them within Victory alongside their male counterparts. In 1967 most of the former Clarence Barracks buildings were demolished, the site having been acquired for housing by the City Council. The officers' quarters survived; the last of the WRNS having left in 1970, the building was acquired for use by the Portsmouth City Museum in 1972.

Born in Minsk, he survived the German invasion of the USSR in a remote village and was almost killed while trying to join the Partisans. He spent six years imprisoned in Siberian gulags for distributing books sympathetic to Zionism. After being under investigation by the KGB for spreading Zionist ideas, he immigrated to Israel in 1969. Once there, he campaigned for the Israeli government to assist others who wished to emigrate from the USSR to Israel. He also published memoirs of his earlier experiences. He died in Jerusalem in 2017. Biography Anatoly (Yitzhak) Rubin was born in Minsk, Byelorussia (later Belarus). His father was religiously observant, and his mother maintained some traditions out of respect for him. Rubin was more attracted to Russian role models than Jewish ones. In the summer of 1941, when the Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union by way of Minsk, Rubin was forced to join the stream of refugees fleeing deeper into Russia, and was strafed by the Luftwaffe. After two days, he reached the town of Smilovichi, some from Minsk. There he was reunited with his aunt and her young son. The three of them remained with a Jewish blacksmith, until the Germans occupied the town, preventing their plans to move farther east. They were forced to return to occupied Minsk, where they found a second aunt along with his mother and two sisters. Rubin's father was at work away from home when the invasion occurred. Upon his return to Minsk, he was told his family had fled towards Moscow. He was later murdered by bandits while searching for his family. In Minsk, as part of the German invasion, legislation caused displacement of Jews into the Minsk ghetto. Rubin's family lived with two other families in two small rooms. They obtained their daily necessities at great risk from German sentries by bartering their aunt's belongings through the ghetto fence. Their situation was alleviated by his sister Tamara, whose Aryan looks allowed her to pass as a non-Jew. In November 1941, the Germans began the liquidation of the ghetto. The residents, his family among them, were marched off to the killing pit. However, Rubin and his older sister Tamara managed to escape. Anatoly Rubin's story is written in Barbara Epstein's book \\"The Minsk Ghetto 1941‚Äì1943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism\\" Tamara joined the partisans and he fled to the 'Aryan' part of the town where, beset by the hatred and physical abuse by the locals, he tried to survive. In the end, he returned to the ghetto, where he lived at first with aunts and worked on forced labor crews. Labor forced work in the Minsk ghetto In March 1942,Rubin (1977), pp. 21‚Äì27. as his labor crew was filing back into the ghetto they were halted by SS men who were implementing a round of selektion He was narrowly able to escape back to the ghetto where some of the remaining residents provided a cellar for him to hide in. The next day, he returned to his own house. By day, he continued to work on the forced labor crews, since laborers were fed 30 grams of bread and a ladle of soup for their efforts. By July 1942, the majority of the ghetto's Jews had been murdered. Before the ghetto was finally liquidated on 21 October 1943, a German woman who had worked as a maid at his school smuggled Rubin out to relatives of her husband in an outlying village. He succeeded by using Aryan papers that he had received from another friend, also a local ethnic German. Rubin was now able to live and work in the village as a non-Jew, doing farm work and cow-herding. Partisans, suspecting he was a German spy, almost killed him.Rubin (1977), pp. 37‚Äì41. In the spring of 1944, the Red Army liberated his village. He destroyed his Russian papers and returned to Minsk, where he discovered that not a single member of his family remained alive. His attempts to enlist in the Red Army were refused on the grounds of him being underage. Instead he enrolled in a trade school, which provided bed, board and employment. First incarceration Anatoly Rubin in the obligatory work camps 1962 Rubin was sent by the local boxing federation to take part in a national exhibition of physical culture in Red Square in Moscow. On his return (14 November 1946), he was arrested and jailed for abandoning a military facility. A military court sentenced him to five years 're-education' \`in a labor camp for his 'nationalist' (i.e. Jewish) views, his unhealthy opinions about the Soviet regime, and his destructive influence on local youth.Rubin (1977), pp. 47‚Äì51. Life in prison was oppressive.Rubin (1977), pp. 51‚Äì60. There was a significant class-gap between the 'regular' and the criminal prisoners. The latter carried on their own terror regime, and effectively ruled prison life. Rubin instigated an uprising against them. He was transferred to a labor camp. The regime at these camps was a combination of hunger, physical abuse and hard forced labor. A niece heard of his imprisonment and sought his release. She eventually reached a top-ranking general who ordered a review of his case. His sentence was changed to a twelve-month probation. Back in Minsk, he entered The Institute of Physical Culture, which provided generous stipends, larger food rations and even an array of sportswear. His boxing studies were successful. He won fight after fight and steadily built up his physical strength, further motivated by the fact that he could now effectively defend himself against anti-Semitic attacks, which came from many directions.–ó–µ–º—Å–∫–æ–≤ –í.–ù. –ö –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω. 1944‚Äì1951 –≥–æ–¥—ã // –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –°–°–°–†. 1990. ‚Ññ 4 (Zemskov V.N. On repatriation of Soviet citizens. Istoriya SSSR., 1990, No.4 Awakening of national identity The ongoing anti-Semitism Rubin encountered from local Russians steadily fashioned his Jewishness.Rubin (1977), pp. 74‚Äì79.Rapoport (1991), pp. 119‚Äì120 He came to understand that he was unwelcome in Russia, and if he was ever to have a home it could only be in the State of Israel. He now devoted all of his energy and resources toward that goal. In 1955, while in Riga for a boxing tournament, he first encountered Jews who observed Jewish customs, holidays and traditions. As Soviet rule in Latvia only dated to the Second World War, Jewish activists, especially in Beitar, were still open and active. Well-stocked Jewish libraries were also available. Determined to expand his Jewish knowledge upon his return, he discovered written material of Jewish interest in the central library. He studied and began to openly refer to material in his conversations concerning the ubiquitous Russian hatred of Jews. Young Minsk Jews were also interested in Gromyko's and Cherepakhin's speeches about the establishment of the new state of Israel, with which Russia then enjoyed warm relations. Rubin would push to awaken their interest in Jewish life and in the State of Israel. In 1956 he first encountered foreign tourists. He also described to them what it was like to be a Jew in the USSR, with its constant waves of anti-Semitism. He asked them to relay this to the United States and Israel. All of these conversations were recorded by the KGB. In 1957, an international youth festival was held in Moscow. Rubin, along with Jews from throughout Russia, approached the Israeli delegation. These Soviet Jews surrounded the Israelis and could not stop asking them questions. He himself photographed the delegation and the Israeli flag. Rubin met the delegation head to obtain material for the Jewish youth in Minsk. Since the delegation was being monitored by the KGB, the exchange of material could not take place. He still managed to accumulate a significant quantity of literature, which he used extensively in Minsk. His enthusiasm for Jewish things led him to ignore the rules of caution. Interrogation, investigation and trial The KGB was closing in, and he was arrested. He refused to incriminate those who shared in his Jewish activities, and he managed to dispose of secret information that was on his person. At interrogation it became apparent that the KGB had amassed detailed and accurate information on him and on his friends and relatives.(After his trial, one of his relatives told him that a listening device had been hidden in the attic above his apartment.) Evidence obtained by bugging and photographing was not admissible in a court of law, and he believed that this legality would be observed. Yet, the greater part of the charges brought against him were based precisely on this \\"inadmissible evidence\\". Despite the various 'methods' of interrogation employed against him, Rubin did not reveal information. The official list of the charges was treason, attempted assassination of a senior party leader and government minister, (in this case, the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev), anti-Soviet propaganda, dissemination of Zionist literature, ties with the Israeli embassy and the inflaming nationalist passions. Two weeks into his interrogation a new investigator arrived whose assignment was to persuade Rubin to denounce Israeli embassy staff for conducting subversive activities under the guise of diplomatic activity. Rubin refused and no further attempt was ever made to recruit him as a collaborator. Two others had been arrested along with Rubin. One was the wrestling champion of the Minsk republic, to whom Jewish refugees from Minsk had given Israeli literature, along with a sealed package to take back to Rubin. The wrestler did as he was asked, without checking to see what he was carrying. Both Rubin and the wrestler told this to the interrogators, even though they had not coordinated their testimony. Rubin's second co-accused was a doctor, the son of a veteran communist with long years of underground activity to his credit, including interest in Zionism. Rubin had viewed him as a potential ally and gave him material which the doctor distributed. Once arrested, he broke immediately, writing a letter of confession and penitence, and placed all the blame on Rubin. Rubin accepted all responsibility for acts which had been proved against the doctor. He explained that he adopted this course of action, because in his eyes the issue was not his own actions but his conviction that all three of the accused were perceived to be representatives of Zionist Jewry. For this reason, he declared it was important to him that he retain his dignity, proving once and for all that Jews were people of steadfast principle, and neither cowards nor traitors. The most dangerous of the charges against him was that of attempted assassination of Premier Khrushchev, since that carried the death penalty. He was endlessly questioned on this point, and had persisted in his absolute denials. He refused to accept the court- appointed defense lawyer to defend him, preferring to defend himself. Nevertheless, the court appointed a defense attorney, the chairman of the Byelorussian bar. The trial lasted five months, four of which he was held in solitary confinement. (The treason charge was dropped during the interrogation.) The proceedings were carried out behind closed doors to prevent them from being used by Rubin for advancement of his ideas. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges (in contrast with his co-defendants, who immediately pleaded guilty). He admitted that the literature found in his possession was his, however, he asserted that he did not regard the materials as being anti-Soviet. His court appointed lawyer admitted that he was guilty of grave crimes, although he endeavored to mitigate the verdict by recounting his life history: that during the war he had been held in a ghetto and orphaned at the age of 13; that the anti-Semitic Fascist Nazis had slaughtered his whole family, which accounted for his adult sensitivity to anti-Semitism; that brushes with a few anti-Semitic hooligans since then had left him over- sensitive, which Zionist propaganda had then exploited. Twenty witnesses testified at the trial. In his closing remarks, the prosecutor asked that Rubin be sentenced to five years re-education in a labor camp as the organizer of a criminal cell. The doctor was sentenced to two years and expulsion from the Communist Party and the wrestler to six months. The trial lasted six months, until 29 April 1959; the KGB's file No.19121-s about the trial and the sentence is in Minsk.RUBIN ANATOLY PINKHUSOVICH in the list of VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR IN THE USSR, as cited by the Memorial Society on the basis of the Memory Books issued or prepared for release in various regions of the former USSR, as well as a number of unpublished sources In his closing remarks, Rubin defended his actions, highlighted state-sanctioned anti- Semitism and the suppression of the Jews' national life. He declared his goal to leave for his homeland, Israel. His defense lawyer had assumed that he would not get more than three years. However, after Rubin's speech, the judges reconsidered and sentenced him to six years; the KGB's file on this case is in Moscow. Return to the gulag The KGB had spread the word that Rubin had planned to blow up the Minsk hotel; that he had been caught in the company of an agent who had given him information to take to the West; and that a half million rubles in foreign currency were found in his possession. Everything about the gulags was familiar there from his ten years before, except the majority of prisoners were now political internees. He was first sent to Lagopunkt 11, Map of Gulag camp administrations and stories from Central Europe next to the Yaya train station. The inmate population was mostly Nazi war criminals ( e.g. Gestapo investigators). When asked what they were in for, their inevitable answer was, \\"Because of the Yids\\". During the last three years of his sentence (1962‚Äì1965), he was interned at Lagopunkt 10 where all prisoners wore striped overalls, were held in cells after work, and denied the 'privilege' of walking around the camp grounds. The rations were also several grades severer than in other camps. Ten percent of the camp was composed of Jews, some of whom had been convicted of Zionist activism. They came from every corner of the Soviet Union. Rubin had thought that he was alone but, under his leadership, all the Jews in the camp were united and of one mind on Israel. They met to exchange information. Veteran Zionists shared history, culture and traditions. Some knew Hebrew and began giving lessons. They compiled their own small dictionaries by taking Russian primers and writing the Hebrew for each Russian word above it. They composed and learned by heart frequently used sentences. They celebrated every Jewish holiday. For this activity, which was forbidden both within the camp and in the USSR generally, they would gather in one of the clothing storerooms to hear one of the older inmates recite the prayers. As far as was possible they observed the commandments, and on Yom Kippur every one fasted, religious and secular alike. For them this was not only a religious observance, but a demonstration of national unity. They fashioned old silver coins into Magen David pendants, which they wore under their shirts. Collaboration was not tolerated. Among the Jewish political inmates there was an unwritten, iron-clad law that no one was to join any officially organized structure in any way. Anyone who did so was immediately totally ostracized.Ron Fedder Amit (2004), pp.38‚Äì46 Circumstances offered a prospect for his early release. The camp commandant informed him that as commandant, he had to draw up a prisoner assessment and he was included in a list of inmates who were willing to undertake \\"public activity\\". Upon hearing this, Rubin angrily demanded that his name be removed from this \\"blacklist\\". Two weeks later, the Prosecutor General informed him that he would never be eligible for commutation of his sentence. The KGB's file about those six years is in Moscow. =Leon Uris' Exodus= Prisoners made great efforts to obtain reading materials. One of the prisoners was a well-known writer who was allowed to receive books. He was friendly with many Jewish inmates and defended them against anti-Semitic assaults. He told Rubin that he had received a book in English called Exodus that he might find interesting. Other Jewish inmates immediately organized a group reading. Rubin had the book disguised as a Soviet textbook. The book was passed from hand to hand, and smuggled by Rubin in the transfers to other camps. In one of these camps, a Jew undertook its translation into Russian. Immediately upon its completion, Rubin had it smuggled out to the world beyond the camps. There, in samizdat form, it fulfilled a critical and formative role in the awakening the national consciousness of Soviet Jewry. =Release from the Gulag and return to Minsk= As the prospect of his release came closer, his health began to fail as a result of the endless stress of hunger rations, physical strain, and inhuman conditions. Throughout the spring of 1964, the inmates worked standing in pools of freezing melt-water, as a result, pain in his feet and legs built up until he could hardly sleep at night. His release date had been set for Tuesday, 8 December 1964. The camp authorities offered him an early release on condition that he sign an application for a pardon, which was effectively an admission of guilt, which he declined. Upon his release, he later said, \\"I was stepping out into the biggest prison camp of them all‚Äîthe Soviet Union itself\\". Rubin had friends in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Riga and elsewhere. Friends introduced him into their circles. After four days in Moscow, he traveled to Minsk and then to Riga. He met with youth, attended the synagogue and visited Rombula ravine where the Jews of Riga had been massacred. When he left for the station, it was clear that the KGB was shadowing him. He boarded one coach and moved to another, certain that the KGB would be waiting for him in Minsk. The agent did not find him and decided that Rubin had eluded him. When he arrived at his Minsk apartment, a police agent appeared to record his address. Zionist activity in Minsk and departure from Russia Upon returning to Minsk, Rubin found himself unemployable. A month later, he was informed that the charges against him had been unfounded and he was fully rehabilitated. This was apparently a result of the fall of Khrushchev in October 1964. He was soon employed by the Minsk Municipal Hospital as a senior physical exercise teacher. At the same time, he set up activities to teach the city's Jews about Judaism and the State of Israel. Soon he had created a cadre committed to Jewish national revival. Knowing that he was a KGB target, he was careful not to endanger them. He compartmentalized all those involved, and the lines of distribution of material. Several times it happened that someone would approach him and suggest, in absolute secrecy, that he give him a booklet to read that he himself had put into circulation. Ze'ev Jabotinsky's writings were especially popular. Rubin himself translated them into Russian and ensured there was a wide circulation To obtain material, Rubin traveled to other towns, where he had friends from the camps. To justify these visits, he took advantage of Soviet regulations that allowed anyone who donated blood to receive two days vacation. Rubin combined these with his regular, weekly day of rest, resulting in three-day trips away from Minsk. On a trip to Riga, he learned that the KGB was investigating him. He warned his contacts to dispose of anything incriminating. Almost every friend and contact of Rubin's was detained and questioned by the KGB. Finally, his own turn came. He decided to deny everything, because in Russia a 'no' always remained a 'no'. He was interrogated for five days, from morning to evening. On the sixth day, the agents confronted him with a friend, who it emerged had revealed everything he knew. Rubin violated the rules of interrogation by jumping up and declaring that everything was a lie. Faced with his refusal to admit anything, the chief interrogator closed the investigation against him. Soon after, the authorities in Riga started issuing exit permits for Israel to selected Jews. He traveled to Riga and asked friends who had received permits to try to obtain an official invitation for him to immigrate once they reached Israel. Such an invitation did arrive and the OBIR registered the invitation. Rubin was summoned to OBIR and informed by its director: \\"You have been granted a travel permit. It's better you go to this Israel of yours than stay here poisoning the minds of Soviet youth.\\" Rubin was the first Jew from Minsk to receive an emigration permit after the Six Day War. He was given twelve days to leave, during which time he traveled to bid farewell to friends. A large crowd came to the train station to see him off in person. There were speeches, and Israeli songs and dances. Many Jews sent him their names and addresses, asking that they too be sent an official invitation to make aliyah. They sent the message that Israel do all in its power to help them leave the Soviet Union. Immigration to Israel Anatoly Rubin and his comrades with David Ben Gurion in Sde Boker, 1969 Rubin landed in Israel on 1 May 1969, and was sent to an absorption center in the northern town of Carmiel. There he found a large group of Russian Zionist activists who felt the time had come for open and public action against attempts to halt emigration from the USSR. He and his friends, Joseph Khrul and Joseph Schneider, wrote to the prime minister, Golda Meir, who invited them to her office. An 18-member group from Georgia had also been invited, along with attorney Lidia Slovina and her husband, Zionist activists from Riga. The attendees all wanted to know why more was not being done to get Russian Jews out of the USSR. The Prime Minister explained that Israeli policy was to maintain public silence. Upon emerging from the meeting, the attendees concluded that they would have to take action themselves. Two of them flew to the United States to arouse public opinion there. At the same time, NATIV (a department of Israel's Foreign Ministry that was tasked with fostering Jewish education and awareness behind the Iron Curtain, and in facilitating emigration to Israel) sent two representatives to America to do the same, Joseph Khrul and then Rubin. At the time, the media was prohibited from publishing the names of those who had left the USSR. One American journalist had not heard of the prohibition and published Rubin's name and everything he told them. Anatoly and his comrades at the end of the hunger strike in the Kottel, 1970 When Russian Aliyah activists failed to persuade either NATIV or the Israeli Government to do more, they declared a hunger strike in front of the Wailing Wall. NATIV strongly opposed this move but it became the crucial push that set the movement to 'Let my People Go' in motion. Rubin, Khrul, Joseph Schneider and Asher Blank were enlisted by NATIV as advisers. In the camps, Rubin had felt a painful sense of aloneness and despair at the lack of outside support. He never forgot the activists' plea to him that Israel not remain silent, but rather do all in its power to help them get out. In 1972, Rubin married Karny Jabotinsky Rubin, daughter of Eri Jabotinsky and grand daughter of Ze‚Äôev Jabotinsky, Psychiatrist and former ombudsman to the National Health Law (1996-2006). They had two children, Eri and Tamar, and later three grandchildren, Yoav, Maya-Shai and Itamar. Previously, in 1969, after he immigrated to Israel his daughter Ilona was born in the USSR and later had 2 grandchildren. The family lives in Atlanta, USA. In Israel, Rubin began teaching physical education, at first in schools and then at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The link between physical fitness and national pride continued to drive him. To ensure that his experiences in the Holocaust and the Gulags were not forgotten, he wrote his memoirs, first in Russian, a work for which he shared first prize in a nationwide competition, 'My Path to the Land of Israel', which he was awarded in 1975, by Israeli President Ephraim Katzir. The book was then translated into Hebrew and published in 1977 by Dvir Publishing, under the name Brown Boots, Red Boots: From the Minsk Ghetto to the Siberian Labor Camps. After his death, Israeli author Galila Ron-Feder Amit reworked the translation. In 2004, she had written about Rubin in her book Prisoner of Zion, a Journey to the USSR of the Early Sixties and Prisoner of Zion Anatoly Rubin, the 26th volume of the Time Tunnel series. Anatoly Rubin lights one of the six memorial torches at the National Observance of Holocaust Memorial Day at Yad VaShem in Jerusalem, 2012 In 1989, Rubin was sent by NATIV to the USSR to encourage Aliyah. Over the next two years many Minsk and Leningrad Jews followed him to Israel. Rubin died on 16 January 2017, and was buried in the Kiryat Anavim cemetery, near Jerusalem. Awards and recognition In 2012, he was honored to light one of the six memorial torches at the National Observance of Holocaust Memorial Day at Yad VaShem in Jerusalem.

A duospaced font (also called a duospace font) is a fixed-width font whose letters and characters occupy either of two integer multiples of a specified, fixed horizontal space. Traditionally, this means either a single or double character width. although the term has also been applied to fonts using fixed character widths with another simple ratio between them. These dual character widths are also referred to as half-width and full-width, where a full-width character occupies double the width of a half-width character. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters and spacings have more than two different widths. And, unlike monospaced fonts, this means a character can occupy up to two effective character widths instead of a single character width. This extra horizontal space allows for the accommodation of wider glyphs, such as large ideographs, that cannot reasonably fit into the single character width of strictly uniform, monospaced font. Although associated with Asian character sets and halfwidth and fullwidth forms, the general notion of duospaced fonts is not limited to such characters.

Retrieved on 08 April 2018. Plot Adam Merkin, a white graduate student at Berkeley, is writing a thesis on the use of the word \\"nigga\\" in battle rap. To research, he attends a freestyle rap battle between rappers X-Tract and Behn Grym and brings his girlfriend Maya along; Maya is offended by the sexism she perceives in the bars used in the battle. Adam attempts to interview Grym and is made fun of for his rhetoric. In the parking lot outside the event, Grym is called out by young white rapper Billy Pistolz, but Adam steps in and delivers a freestyle verse accusing Pistolz of cultural appropriation. An impressed Grym agrees to speak with Adam further. Adam's father, Professor Merkin, is a best-selling author and professor at Berkeley. When Adam runs the idea of his thesis by his father, he is met with more ridicule. Adam accepts an offer by battle promoter Donnie Narco for a battle for newcomers against Korean rapper Prospek. At the battle, Adam attempts to perform joke lines but doesn't get the reaction he hoped for; he falls back on Asian jokes, winning over the crowd and taking the battle. Adam also meets rappers Che Corleone, Devine Wright, and Megaton, who is known for his aggressive persona. At a vegan restaurant, Adam attempts to convince the disapproving Maya that it's okay for him to keep battling but insults both her and a waitress in rhyme, angering her and getting himself ejected from the restaurant. Maya later leaves Adam after his rapper friends offend her. After an event where Adam, Che, Devine, and Grym all win their battles, they attend a house party hosted by Megaton where Che has sex with Megaton's girlfriend, porn star Bella Backwoods. An enraged Megaton challenges Che to a battle in the coming days. Adam tries to stay with Grym, who reveals his life outside battle rapping: he is a video game designer with a wife and a child with cystic fibrosis. He states that he maintains his privacy because he doesn't want people to use personal insults against him and, as such, never uses personal insults himself. Grym offers Adam to stay at his house, but his wife accuses Adam for appropriating black culture and refuses to let him stay. Adam is contacted by another promoter, offering him the chance to battle Grym for $5,000 at the same event as Megaton and Che's battle, but he turns it down, stating that battle rap has ruined his life. Maya then uses an online video of Adam's battle with Prospek as supporting material for her own thesis, turning the student body of Berkeley against him. His father also disowns him, and the dean of the school suspends his scholarship. Left with no other choice, Adam calls the promoter and accepts the battle. At the event, Adam and Grym go head to head. Grym delivers scathing but fictional bars against Adam, but Adam betrays his friend to win by using Grym's actual personal details against him, with emphasis on his daughter's illness. While enraged during the fight, Adam gets angry at two other rappers who are talking during the fight, and he and Grym perform an impromptu tag-team battle against them. Afterwards, Grym informs Adam that they are no longer friends, because while other battle rappers' cruelty is merely an act, Adam's battle rapping has become an outlet for his actual cruelty. Grym departs, saying he needs to be where he belongs; with his family. Desperate, Adam attempts to call Maya and ask her to marry him, but she lashes out at the ridiculousness of the idea and tells him stay away from her. Megaton \\"bodies\\" Che during their battle, even bringing his girlfriend out to freestyle about how bad he is at sex. Afterwards, Megaton starts insulting the crowd, daring anyone to challenge him. Adam, left with nothing else, steps into the ring and takes on Megaton, who hits him in the face during his verse. Unfazed, Adam gets back on his feet and calls Megaton out for putting on an aggressive act. Megaton concedes the battle to a triumphant Adam. Afterwards, Adam, now sleeping on a park bench on the Berkeley campus, watches a video on his phone and says he's decided what his rap name is, but the film cuts to credits before he can say.

It was originally developed to treat epilepsy in humans, but clinical trials were terminated upon findings of unfavorable metabolic differences in smokers and non-smokers. Imepitoin acts as a low-affinity (4,350‚Äì5,140 nM; relative to Ki = 6.8 nM for diazepam and Ki = 1.7 nM for clonazepam) partial agonist of the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor (up to 12‚Äì21% of the maximal potentiation of diazepam, a full agonist of this site).

It may be useful against an opponent playing a Ranging Rook Bear-in-the-hole position. The name comes from the way the rook moves from second file to the ninth file on the bottom rank as if it were an underground subway. This bottom rank positioning of the rook is shared by a few other strategies such as the Pinwheel and Right King openings. Overview It's an attack opening used against Bear-in-the-hole Ranging Rook and Right King. Starting with Black's moving the knight to 85, it's a powerful attack concentrated on 93 by rook, bishop, left knight and left lance. It's particularly effective against Bear-in-the-hole, since the king has no escape route and it's possible to do checkmate in one gulp. In addition, in a Double Static Rook if the rival uses Right King, it's possible to start the attack in a location close to that king. Although boasting superb defense power, this opening requires moving almost all pieces from the 1st to the 2nd rank, which takes a lot of moves, and also makes the formation constrained. For this reason, this opening is seldom used.

He lived most of his life in Bristol. Early life and education Cottle was born in Cardiff on 17 March 1917. He was the younger son of Arthur Bertram Cottle (1881-1964), a clerk, and Cecile Mary Bennett, a schoolmistress. He attended Howard Gardens Secondary School in Cardiff, where his precocious talents came to the notice of Evan Frederic Morgan (1893-1949), 2nd Viscount Tredegar, Welsh poet, author, occultist and convert to Roman Catholicism, who gave Cottle the use of the extensive library at Tredegar House. A prolonged and severe bout of rheumatic fever in his early teens permanently affected his eyesight and he subsequently completely lost the sight of his right eye. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, Cottle went on to the University of Wales, where he obtained a double first in English and Latin, and a second in Greek, his favourite subject. Whilst there he became a protege of Dr Victor Erle Nash-Williams (1897-1955), Keeper of the Department of Archaeology at the National Museum of Wales, and lecturer in Archaeology from whom he developed a life long interest in Roman and early Celtic Christianity and epigraphy. Cottle was encouraged by Nash-Williams to become a museum curator but he eventually trained as a schoolmaster, gaining a first in education at Cardiff, and taught at Cowbridge Grammar School.  Second World War  At the outbreak of the Second World War, Cottle was judged to be medically unfit for active service and instead became a private in the Royal Pioneer Corps, stationed at Huyton. Whilst serving there, in May 1941, he witnessed the Liverpool Custom House burn down in a German air raid. Later, he was transferred to the Royal Army Educational Corps and rose to the rank of Sergeant-Major. In 1942 he was billeted with the Iredale family in Workington while attached to a coastal regiment of the Royal Artillery during his attachment with the AEC. Here he forged a life-long friendship with the two Iredale sisters, one of whom Hilda Queenie, published a volume on Thomas Traherne in 1935 and deepened Cottle's knowledge and appreciation of the work of the Welsh metaphysical poet, Henry Vaughan, \\"the Silurist\\". Both Traherne and Vaughan became favourite poets of Cottle's. He later taught generations of Bristol students to appreciate their works. Eventually Cottle received a commission and was transferred to Bletchley Park in 1943, where he read decoded Enigma messages. In 1945 he was transferred to the Albanian section of the Foreign Office during the civil war between the Zoggists and the Communists. Whilst there, he compiled an Albanian language Grammar and Syntax for use by the Foreign Office. Amongst those who were transferred to his staff was the Bristol-educated linguist, Stuart Edward Mann (1905-1986), who had traveled to Albania in the 1930s, subsequently wrote a historical grammar of Albanian. Mann had a rich fund of anecdotes about the country in general, and of King Zog and his sisters in particular, whose English tutor he had been, and which Cottle frequently and dramatically recounted.  Academic career  In 1946, Cottle took a position as an assistant lecturer in the department of English in the University of Bristol. In 1962, he became a senior lecturer, and in 1976 a reader in mediaeval studies. He taught courses on the Greek lyric, for Professor H. D. F. Kitto, F.B.A. (1897-1982), on pre-Norman Irish art and architecture, the Anglo-Saxons, Middle English, Names, and on the Bristol Romantics. Cottle was an expert on the writings of the \\"Accrington poetess\\", Janie Whittaker (1877-1933), and the Welsh Nonconformist minister, the Revd Henry Maurice (1634-1682), an Independent, who had formerly held the living of Church Stretton, and whose journal for the year of Indulgence, 1672, belonged to him. He described himself as a Welshman, an amateur herald, and an Anglican, and he was immensely proud of his Welsh roots. This led him to bequeath his extensive library to St Woolos Cathedral , Newport, where his remains are buried. His students at Bristol included the novelist, Deborah Moggach, and the Middle English scholar, Thomas Lingen Burton, Emeritus- Professor of English at the University of Adelaide. Cottle's life-long interest in archaeology, led to his active involvement in the excavation of Keynsham abbey by the Bristol Folk House. He became the president of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society and was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. A fourth generation Primitive Methodist, the grandson and great-grandson of local preachers, he was confirmed into the Church in Wales in 1942 and thereafter became an active and forceful supporter of the liturgy of the Established Church, the Book of Common Prayer, the 39 Articles, and the Authorized Version of the Bible. Successively church warden of four Bristol churches, St. Mary Redcliffe; St. Paul's (the centre of the Anglican Chaplaincy to the University); St. George's, Brandon Hill; and latterly Christ Church with St Ewen, Broad Street, he was an active member of the Bristol Diocesan Advisory Committee for the Care of Churches. He befriended numerous clergy and ordinands in the diocese, and through his roles as Sub Warden, successively at Wills Hall (1947-1948), and from 1948-1972 at Burwalls, (once the home of the tobacco baron, Sir George Wills), he was an influential figure in the lives of many generations of undergraduates. Following his retirement in 1982 he remained active as a lecturer and reviewer, and in 1987 a group of his former colleagues and students celebrated his contribution to the study of Middle English by presenting him with a festschrift, Medieval Literature and Antiquities: Studies in Honour of Basil Cottle, edited by Myra Stokes and T.L.

After easily and rapidly learning all that was taught in the public schools of Gloucester, she studied by herself. Career At the age of fifteen she began to teach in the public schools. She continued until she was twenty-two, at the same time writing for the press. Her success with an adult Bible class led her to expand her theological study. Her husband encouraged her to preach the gospel. She began in 1869 in New England. In 1872 she was licensed in Boston to preach and became the non-resident pastor of a church in Marlborough, Massachusetts. Her husband at the same time settled in Cambridge, and accepted a call to the pastorate of the Church of the Restoration in Philadelphia, while Bowles was called as non-resident pastor of the Universalist Church in Easton, Pennsylvania, a position she held for three years. She left that parish to lay the foundation of a new church in Trenton, New Jersey. She was regularly ordained in 1874 and preached and lectured since then in most of the large cities of the United States. When without a church of her own, she shared the parish work of her husband and was constantly engaged in charitable and philanthropic work. In addition to all her ministerial work, she lectured in various parts of the country under the auspices of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in which organization she was state superintendent of various departments. She was national lecturer of the American Woman Suffrage Association and president of State, county and city suffrage organizations, as well as an active member of many other reforms. Notwithstanding all the duties and labors, she was famed among her acquaintances as a wise and affectionate mother and a model housekeeper. One of her most popular lectures was on \\"Strong-minded Housekeeping\\" which embodied her own experience in household cares and management. In 1892 she published The Old Man of the Mountain and Old Mother Ann. Personal life She married Rev. Benjamin F. Bowles (1824-1892), pastor of the Universalist Church in Melrose, Massachusetts. She became the stepmother of three children, and later the mother of three more. She was an expert swimmer and could handle a saw, hammer or rolling-pin with equal dexterity.

TTOs engage in a variety of commercial activities that are meant to facilitate the process of bringing research developments to market, often acting as a channel between academia and industry. Most major research universities have established TTOs in the past decades in an effort to increase the impact of university research and provide opportunities for financial gain. While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.  History  The history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the science policy of the United States. The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in Vannevar Bush's letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which had coordinated large private-public partnership research projects as part of the war effort, including the Manhattan Project. Bush's answer was Science - the Endless Frontier. In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund basic research at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power. As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government. Federal research funding drove the growth of the research university. Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry. Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the Research Corporation, while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university. Some universities, such as Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin, had active licensing programs of their own. There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980. During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs. The Bayh‚ÄìDole Act of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices. The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy. The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.  Functions  While the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:  Industry partnerships  An important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market. Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the \\"pull\\" method, in which TTOs receive interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the \\"push\\" method, in which TTOs actively seek industry partners for this purpose.  Intellectual property  The Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek patent protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university. Universities typically license the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.  Counseling and incubation for startups  TTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students. By providing resources, funding, and connections to university spin-off companies, TTOs attempt to increase the chances of startup success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company. Hence, many TTOs establish business incubators and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university. Some examples of such incubators and programs include the Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator as well as the Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator at Harvard University, and Fab Lab MSI, affiliated with the University of Chicago. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.  Structure and organization  The structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities. Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in multiple disciplines throughout the university. TTOs can by classified into three different types: * internal: existing as an integrated part of the university and controlled by university administration * external: existing as an independent company that does not operate under the control of university administration * mixed: having components of both internal and external TTOs As of 2012 the \\"internal\\" type was most common in the US. TTOs of different universities can also collaborate between them to grow, thus originating new organizational structures. Such structures are: *Network structure: the existing organizational forms of each TTO are maintained and the single organizations operate together in a virtual manner creating a subset of links between the existing TTOs involved in the consortium * Strong Hub structure: a new central TTO is created and it works for each university involved in the consortium * Light Hub structure: a new central TTO with the functions of a hub is created, but each university involved in the consortium maintains internally some technology transfer activities in a dedicated internal office.  Strategies  TTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off). Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology. Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing, but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure). While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.  International diffusion & TTOs outside the US  As many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of \\"professor's privilege\\", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many OECD and EU nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh- Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities. Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007. Countries such as France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights. As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege. Hence, there has been a marked increase in the commercialization activities of universities and creation of TTOs in Europe. Several Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model. Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries.  Criticisms  Although universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development. It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs). Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university. Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue. Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry. Rebecca Eisenberg and Michael Heller have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating patent thickets and a tragedy of the anticommons especially in the field of biomedical research. As of 2012, evidence for such an anticommons effect in the practice of biomedical science was lacking.

According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. Though there is no time limit for speeches, a voluntary guideline of 15 minutes is requested.http://www.unhcr.org/5028f5129.pdf The president's chosen theme for this year's debate was chosen by President Miroslav Lajcak as \\"Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.\\"http://sdg.iisd.org/events/72nd-session-of-the-un-general-assembly- unga-72/https://gadebate.un.org/en Speaking schedule 19 September ;Morning schedule * ‚Äì Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres * ‚Äì 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly - President Miroslav Lajcak (Opening statement) * ‚Äì President Michel Temer * ‚Äì President Donald Trump * ‚Äì President Alpha Cond√© * ‚Äì President Doris Leuthard * ‚Äì President Andrej Kiska * ‚Äì President Muhammadu Buhari * ‚Äì President Milo≈° Zeman * ‚Äì President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf * ‚Äì President Emmanuel Macron * ‚Äì President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf (Scheduled) * ‚Äì President Juan Manuel Santos Calder√≥n * - President Emomali Rahmon * - President Edgar Chagwa Lungu * - President Dalia Grybauskaitƒó * - Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani * - President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan * - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ;Afternoon schedule * - President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta * - Prince Albert II * - President Andrzej Duda * - President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi * - President Shavkat Mirziyoyev * - President Serzh Sargsyan * - President Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s Rivera * - President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni * - President Maithripala Sirisena * - President Danilo Medina S√°nchez (Scheduled) * - President Kersti Kaljulaid * - President Jimmy Morales * - President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai ;Evening schedule * - President Adama Barrow * - President Evo Morales Ayma * - President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz (Scheduled) * - President Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez Alvarado * - Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz * - Foreign Minister Isselkou Ould Ahmed Izid Bih * - President Jacob Zuma (Scheduled) =Right of Reply= Member states have the option to reply to comments on the day (or even to the days prior), but are limited to 10 minutes for the first response and five minutes for the second response. All speeches are made from the floor, as opposed to the podium for the General Debate. Iran used its turn to respond (through a translator) to Israel in saying that the \\"representative of the Israeli regime made unfounded allegations by trying to deceive the world to distract public opinion from [the] hideous actions of his regime. The nature of the regime that is founded on occupation, violence, and terror can in no way be covered up by accusing others.\\" He said that Israel has \\"weapons of mass misinformation but in this information age it is becoming useless day- by-day. Instead of trying to deceive he should explain to the Assembly why it has invaded all of its neighbours and even beyond the region. It has waged over 15 wars in its lifetime. Why does it ignore tens of resolutions of this Assembly, as well as over 100 resolutions? [As] he spoke today...why does the state sponsor of terrorism continue such acts, including of supporting ISIS by providing arms and assistance...sure this regime has an exceptional capability in committing all crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, including oppression. It is exceptional in barbarity. It has an exceptional capability in killing women and children, destroying homes, schools, and hospitals. It has an exceptional capability in terrorism. He claimed his regime saves live around the world but why does it oppress Palestinians daily. Why does it jail and arrest thousands of Palestinians and why does it carry out a blockade against millions in the Gaza Strip. Does he think that by wearing white he can cover up his red hands? Does he think the world forgets the Sabra and Shatila massacre? He did not explain why the regime, despite its arsenal of conventional weapons, does it have chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Why is it not a party to end weapons of mass destruction, in particular the NPT. Why does it reject the establish of a nuclear-free Middle East despite repeated calls by the UN, the international community and this Assembly over the past 30 years? One question he was expected to answer is why his regime which is the only nuclear weapons possessor in the Middle East, hides behind the doctrine of strategic ambiguity. He shamelessly lectures the world on non-proliferation and accuses Iran, whose [non-military] nuclear capability has been approved by the IAEA. He tried to abuse this Assembly by only accusing others. He also tried to create anxiety over the JCPOA.\\" The session was then ended for the day. 20 September ;Morning schedule * ‚Äì President Sauli Niinist√∂ * ‚Äì President Almazbek Atambaev * ‚Äì President Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev * ‚Äì President David Arthur Granger * ‚Äì Chairman of the Presidency Dragan Coviƒá * ‚Äì President Juan Carlos Varela Rodr√≠guez * ‚Äì President Paul Kagame * ‚Äì President Petro Poroshenko (Scheduled) * ‚Äì President Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara * ‚Äì President Hassan Rouhani * ‚Äì President Rumen Radev ;Late morning session * ‚Äì President Alassane Ouattara * ‚Äì President Petro Poroshenko * ‚Äì President Mahmoud Abbas * ‚Äì President of the European Council Donald Tusk * ‚Äì Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s Santos da Costa * ‚Äì Prime Minister Shinzo Abe * ‚Äì Prime Minister Mark Rutte * ‚Äì Prime Minister Theresa May * ‚Äì Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni ;Afternoon schedule * ‚Äì President Lenin Moreno Garc√©s * ‚Äì Vice President Marta Gabriela Michetti Illia * ‚Äì President Denis Sassou Nguesso * ‚Äì President Michelle Bachelet Jeria * ‚Äì President Raimonds Vƒìjonis * ‚Äì President Jacob Zuma * ‚Äì President Hage Geingob * ‚Äì President Filip Vujanoviƒá * ‚Äì President Klaus Werner Iohannis * ‚Äì President Arthur Peter Mutharika * ‚Äì President Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana * ‚Äì President Macky Sall * ‚Äì King Mswati III * ‚Äì President Faiez Mustafa Serraj * ‚Äì President Baron Divavesi Waqa * ‚Äì Vice President Henry Van Thio * ‚Äì Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al- Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah * ‚Äì Prime Minister Erna Solberg (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas Maldonado 21 September ;Morning schedule * ‚Äì President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá * ‚Äì President Jovenel Moise * ‚Äì President Moon Jae-in * ‚Äì President Michel Aoun * ‚Äì President Nicos Anastasiades * ‚Äì President Roch Marc Christian Kabor√© * ‚Äì President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo * ‚Äì President Ali Bongo Ondimba * ‚Äì President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour * ‚Äì President Danny Faure * ‚Äì Vice President Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi * ‚Äì Prime Minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá * ‚Äì Prime Minister Justin Trudeau * ‚Äì Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi * ‚Äì Prime Minister Miro Cerar * ‚Äì Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Wang Yi ;Afternoon schedule * ‚Äì President Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n * ‚Äì President Azali Assoumani * ‚Äì President Thomas Remengesau Jr. * ‚Äì President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo * ‚Äì President Evaristo do Espirito Santo Carvalho * ‚Äì President Robert Gabriel Mugabe * ‚Äì Vice President Muhammad Jusuf Kalla * ‚Äì Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II ;Evening schedule * ‚Äì Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Prime Minister Enele Sosene Sopoaga * ‚Äì Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili * ‚Äì Prime Minister Gaston Alphonso Browne * ‚Äì Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi * ‚Äì Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth * ‚Äì Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina * ‚Äì Prime Minister Charlot Salwai * ‚Äì Prime Minister Umaro Sissoco Embal√≥ * ‚Äì Prime Minister Selom Komi Klassou * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Alfonso Mar√≠a Dastis Quecedo * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn * ‚Äì =Right of Reply= Ukraine responded to Russia in saying that it would be brief due to the late hour (about 22:45). The representative said that the \\"last thing the General Assembly needs is to get into different exchanges. Russia is recognised by the United Nation as an occupying power in Ukraine. [This is] recognised by the General Assembly, the most representative UN body. Russia has no moral right to lecture on Ukraine until it returns sovereignty.\\" India then responded to Pakistan in criticising its \\"defence of terrorism. It is odd that the state that sheltered Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar should have the gumption to suggest terrorism. Thus this august Assembly and the world knows that efforts to create history does not change [reality]. Pakistan's name from the land of the pure [has changed] to pure terror. Paksitan is Terroristan. [It has harboured] Hafeez Sayyeed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Its counter terrorism strategy has involved it being a haven to terrorists. It protects terrorists. Pakistan must understand that Jammu and Kashmir will always remain an integral part of India. However it ramps up terror, this will not change. Pakistan spoke of its supposed counter terrorism efforts, [but] having diverted international aid to infrastructure of terror, Pakistan is now talking of its suffering from terrorism. The world does not need lectures on democracy and human rights from a state defined as a failed state. Terroristan...if it is committed to civilisation the world may still understand.\\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-slams-pakistan-at- un-calls-it-terroristan/articleshow/60789448.cms Afghanistan responded to Pakistan in referring to \\"safe havens of terror in Pakistan. Pakistan diverts attention from [its] failure to take action against groups with sanctuaries in its territory. Those in Pakistan constitute the main source of instability to Afghanistan and the region. Efforts to this end, from this platform, have yielded nothing. Pakistan prevents a constructive approach to peace and stability in the region and the world. Where was Osama bin Laden killed? Near the capital, Islamabad. Where did Mullah Omar die? In an hospital in Karachi. Where was his successor Mullah Akhtar Mansour found and killed by foreign forces? Quetta in Pakistan. Which passport did he have to travel? Pakistan. From what country has almost every terrorist group entered Afghanistan? From Pakistan. Incessant support for extremist groups by Pakistan...[the] so-called civil war in Afghanistan has been so by the use of proxies for political purposes in Afghanistan. Now the time has come for Pakistan to adopt a constructive approach to promote peace in the region. Lastly Abbasi admitted in an interview a few days ago that the truck used in a bombing might have come from Pakistan to Afghanistan. We will use dialogue to ensure stability for our people. In this context, our resolve to defeat terrorism is unwavering, as is shown by our security forces everyday.\\" Pakistan then responded to India (and added a response to Afghanistan) by saying \\"that it is unfortunate India criticises Pakistan. The oppressed people of Kashmir [have suffered] by Indian occupation forces. The people of occupied Kashmir look to the international community to carry out a free and fair plebiscite to determine their future. The misconceptions India creates is such that only yesterday Indian forces on the Line of Control in Kashmir killed 10 people where many, including women, lost their lives. The strategy of offense-defense is flouted blatantly by India...[this] will never succeed. Commander Kulbhushan Yadav was caught red handed in Pakistan for spreading [propaganda] and espionage. For our Bangladesh brothers and sisters,...we have to come out of hate. The 1971 war issues were resolved by the signing of a tripartite agreement. We have to move on.\\" The representative then responded to Afghanistan in saying that \\"instead of blaming others, [they] should focus on eliminating terrorists in places it cannot control.\\" The session was then closed for the day by the president of the General Assembly. 22 September ;Morning schedule * ‚Äì President Paul Biya * ‚Äì President Taneti Maamau * ‚Äì President Faustin-Archange Touad√©ra * ‚Äì Prime Minister Pavel Filip * ‚Äì Prime Minister Charles Michel * ‚Äì Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay * ‚Äì Prime Minister Edi Rama * ‚Äì Prime Minister Joseph Muscat * ‚Äì Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva ;Late morning session * - Deputy Prime Minister Ph·∫°m B√¨nh Minh * ‚Äì Prime Minister Allen Chastanet * ‚Äì Prime Minister Timothy Harris (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva (Scheduled) * - (Scheduled) * - Foreign Minister Bruno Eduardo Rodriguez Parrilla * - Foreign Minister Khemais Jhinaoui * - Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai * - Foreign Minister Julie Bishop * - Foreign Minister P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ * - Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel * - Foreign Minister Amina Chawahir Mohamed * - Foreign Minister Gudlaugur Th√≥r Th√≥rdarson * - Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr√∂m ;Afternoon session * - King Tupou VI * - Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare * - President Zoran Zaev * - Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn * - Prime Minister Antoni Mart√≠ Petit * - Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire * - Prime Minister Thomas Motsoahae Thabane * - Deputy Prime Minister Louis Straker * - Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn * - Foreign Minister Wilfred Elrington * - Foreign Minister Nicola Renzi * - Foreign Minister Aurelia Frick * - Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias * - Foreign Minister Maxine Pamela Ometa McClean * - Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan * - (Scheduled) * - Foreign Minister Tsend Munkh-Orgil * - Prime Minister Pascal Ir√©n√©e Koupaki * - Foreign Minister Pehin Lim Jock Seng * - Prime Minister Dato' Sri Anifah Aman * - Foreign Minister Samura Matthew Wilson Kamara =Right of Reply= Serbia responded to Albania in saying that \\"as the General Assembly searches for numerous challenges the world is faced with...the same is for Serbia. In order to achieve this, Serbia seeks regional cooperation. We share the western Balkans working together. During the 72nd session of the General Assembly numerous dignitaries underlined sovereignty. Albania again used this august body to call for the independence of the Serbian southern province, so-called state of Kosovo. This is against the charter and the principles of the UN. [Rama] contended that the dialogue is between two states and not Belgrade and Pristina...outstanding issues are being addressed in Brussels by the European Union between Belgrade and Pristina. What the prime minister of Albania said may jeopardise the future. [Amongst] my government's priorities is to reach a solution that is acceptable to all taking into account all communities in Kosovo-Metohija. Kosovo is not independent nor a UN member state. Serbia will use all its means to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\\" Qatar responded to the UAE (through a translator) in criticising the \\"allegations and false claims by the UAE against Qatar which faces an illegal siege and encroachment on its national sovereignty. [We] face an attempt to defame Qatar and trying to hurt its relations with other countries...[to] impose an unjust and unlawful siege. We face actions against our media. [This] violation of good neighbourliness and of the charter of the GCC is thus rejected by many countries. Many countries talked of the negative impact of the siege. The unity of our people [and] solidarity with countries around the world [will prevail]. We believe these measures hurt, [but] despite many attempts to defame Qatar, the international community knows the objective of this campaign. [It has] failed to prove what they sought. The record of Qatar in confronting terrorism is known to all and our partners in this fight. [It is] better than the record of those stating what is contrary to that. Qatar is also working through bilateral mechanisms to fight terror and dry up its source of funding. Whether freezing assets or prevent travelling...the state of Qatar will always be firm in confronting [terrorism]...we all bear collectively responsibility in the charter and [its] perspectives...respect for sovereignty and human rights. This is the best forum to defend international law. UAE must put an end to all violations perpetrated against Security Council such as in Libya. [This will be] leading to[wards] more terrorism as a result of failed policies.\\" Albania responded to Serbia's reply \\"in response to his excellency Edi Rama. We regret at this hour to take the stand but to set the record strait. Let me remind [them] that Kosovo is an independent state. Since 2008 Kosovo is recognised by [111] member states. [It] proved to be a contributor to peace. Kosovo is member of regional groups in south east Europe. It has signed cooperation deals with the EU and is working towards future EU membership. [This has] brought clear benefits and an improve[d] atmosphere in the region. Facilitate[d]...youth in particular. Based on this record, the UN and other groups only benefit by recognition of Kosovo. Based on what my prime minister Edi Rama said, [this] move[s] towards stability...[and is] good for all countries, Serbia included. Serbia and Kosovo engage in dialogue which brought the two countries together to engage issues for the good of its citizens. [This is the] best investment for them to work towards reconciliation. This is what both need...for peace and the future in Europe.\\" The UAE responded (through a translator) to Qatar's response in saying that \\"we regret to see the state of Qatar has once again sought to distract the representatives here. Four countries took measures against the state of Qatar claiming to fight terrorism, but [against] those [who] genuinely fight terrorism in line with international law...To break relations was not difficult but a direct response to Qatar's own actions which destabilise the region. The state that meddles in other Arab states. In point of fact, Qatar is in violation of international law and resolutions of the UN. We will continue with measures taken because we found no other way against Qatar's hostile actions. They can [either] choose to be a rogue state against international law or work in cooperation [with others].\\" Egypt then also responded (through a translator) to Qatar in saying \\"we do not find it odd that the delegation of state of Qatar is using allegations to defend [itself]...Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain are fed up and take measures to prevent the regime from interference in the internal affairs of others. As is known to all, Qatar supports terror in Syria, Iraq, Libya and others. This regime is financing terrorism; for instance, in Iraq they paid two terrorists a ransom; and this regime is also providing weapons to terrorists and providing them with a safe haven. [This includes] even giving Qatar nationality and not extraditing [personnel] per Security Council resolution[s]. [It] also [is] instigating terrorism in a very known way. [Its] terrorism support is explicit in the Security Council committee. The insistence [by] the regime to support terrorism is something we all reject. Its objection to go back [as a] right country...this is why the four countries acted with[in] international law...and the Qatar regime that fighting and countering terrorism is an obligation on all countries [and] is with[in] relevant resolutions.\\" Qatar then used its second Right of Reply in saying that it is \\"truly regrettable that the delegation of UAE would verbally attack Qatar. [It is] not surprising as an investigation of the hack of Qatar news agencies [showed]. [The] result shows the hacking happened from a nearby Gulf state. This crime with a campaign...and lies were continuation of this campaign. Everybody realises [this] was fabricated. Therefore, [it is] ironic the UAE speaks of confronting terrorism when some of its citizens participate[d] in the ugliest acts of terrorism in history.\\" The session was then closed for the day. 23 September ;Morning schedule * ‚Äì (Scheduled) * ‚Äì President Joseph Kabila Kabange * ‚Äì First Vice President Taban Deng Gai * ‚Äì First Vice President Yosiwo George * ‚Äì First Vice President Sher Bahadur Deuba * ‚Äì Prime Minister Peter Paire O'Neill * ‚Äì Deputy Prime Minister Walid Muallem * ‚Äì Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf * ‚Äì (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Adel Ahmed Al-Jubeir * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Darren Allen Henfield * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Alan Peter S.

Qatar has an excellent record in counter-terrorism and ranks high in that regard. The allegations [that] allude to a link between Qatar and terror are baseless. [This is an] unlawful campaign against Qatar, [including] with hacking and piracy. Other members used the same [excuse] and used religious rhetoric to strengthen the claims. These countries are now frustrated and used commercials means to bring pressure on Qatar. to Saudi Arabia, the state of Qatar has strengthened its resolve. In fora such as against the international terror fight, which countries like ours signed, [a] deal [was struck] to stop funding terrorism. To countries that accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism, we say you need to follow our example. The state of Qatar fully follows Security Council resolutions. [we play a]constructive role [for] peace and humanitarian assistance. This paves way to stability and root out terrorism. To Bahrain, a number of contradictions [have been made]. It is surprising the representative of Bahrain...that criticises Qatar used to commend Qatar. What Bahrain is experiencing has a stability effect on the region....counter to our excellent record. It is surprising Bahrain is accusing us of terrorism. We call upon the kingdom of Bahrain to work tirelessly to overcome problems it is facing [and] to support huamn rights. [They should] refrain from marginalising the rule of law. The [accusation against the] state of Qatar [seeks] to obscure internal problems Bahrain is facing [and] will not yield to any resolve. [The accusations] against Qatar are unacceptable. Is it conceivable to prevent students from attending studies? Is it not tagainst human rights? What about legislating laws that put pressure on any citizens that just express sympathy with Qatar...[it is] this rhetoric that fuels the campaign against Qatar.\\" Pakistan responded to India in saying that India had \\"indulged in an orgy of slander against my country. The comments to Pakistan betrays the hostility the leadership has to[wards] Pakistan. [This] hostility [we have] endured for 70 long years. In her vitriol, the Indian foreign minister deliberately ignored the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Let me be clear, Kashmir is not a part of India; it is recognised by the UN as disputed territory. I invite you to look at UN maps. In over dozen resolutions the UN has resolved to let the people of Jammu and Kashmir decide their destiny through a plebiscite. India accepts the resolutions but obfuscates. Women and men have been shot dead [in Kashmir]. Today violence continues with pellet guns [resulting in] children being shot. Everyday people come out to protest. If the parties do not resolve [their issues], the UN has not only the right but an obligation to help resolve dispute. In the case of Jammu and Kashmir, this is explicit since the Security Council has been involved in how the situation should be resolved. Resolutions have no expiry date. Law has not expiry date...India has not morality against the Security Council. India now also refuses bilateral dialogue with Pakistan, either composite or comprehensive. Violence emanates first and formeost from Indian repression of Kashmir. My prime minister proposed [to the] secretary-general [that he] should appoint a special envoy to promote the specifics of the resolutions. In the meantime, [one] should take steps...[such as to] de-list draconian emergency laws and punish those respoinsible for the genocide in Kashmir. If India want to avoid conflict with Pakistan...[it] must end ceasefire violations. [It] must halt support for terrorist groups inside Pakistan. India speaks a lot about terror, [but the] UN should define terrorism, includ[ing] state terrorism. What India's national security advisor boasted against spy agencies in [his] country...Pakistan has in its custody the Indian spy Kulbushan Yadav who confessed to terrorist activities in my country. In fact, it sponsored and perpetrates terrorism and commits aggression against all its neighbours. [It] supports subversion in Pakistan. All [this] proves [is that] India is the mother of terrorists in South Asia. In 70 years of independence, India engaged in over dozen use[s] of force; and it has over 17 insurgencies in its own land. The Indian foreign minister sought to denigrate the founding father of my country, Muhammed Ali Jinnah...[it is ironic coming from a] regime that has the blood of thousands of Muslims in Gujurat...today India is...ruled by a regime who is fascist. [It is being ruled] by the RSS, the same group that assassinated Gandhi. [It has] appointed a fanatic in its largest state. [Its] government allows the lynching of Muslims. [This is] amply documented by human rights organisations. As indeed one of India's biggest authors wrote, and I quote, 'dalits, adivasis await repression' and 'much of the terror in Kashmir.' [It is ironic that] the foreign minister talks of human rights, who is using pellet guns [that are] blinding children? Who is using terrorism against not only Kashmir but hundreds of Indians? Who is using [this] to crush [and ruin] in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. In conclusion, Pakistan remains open to resume [a] comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues, including Kashmir. But dialogue must be against [the] campaign of [its] state- sponsored terrorism in Pakistan.\\" Bahrain responded (through a translator) to Qatar in saying that \\"in response to Qatar's allegations...Saudi Arabia, [the] UAE, Egypt and [are] supported by several [other] countries. These four countries practice [their[ sovereign right in accordance with legal and international practices to impose measures on Qatar because it violated resolutions that state when violations [occur in] one part, then the whole resolution [is violated]. Qatar interfered in the kingdom [of Bahrain] to create chaos. [It] threat[ens the] fabric of Bahrain by giving nationality to many Bahraini families. [It is] also trying since the beginning of [the] boycott measures taken by the four countries by spreading [and] violat[ing] human rights. Although Qatar knows, the kingdom of Bahrain ha[s] taken measures in order to make sure all humanitarian cases are taken under consideration whether for studies or health. The measures by the four countries are sovereign measures, the right of any country under international law. These allegations of boycott is refuted by Qatar [what the] other [state] claims when they talk of economic growth. It is their right however, but they should behave in [such a] way and [they should not] behave in a[n] uncooperative [manner]. Qatar [is] trying to exploit international fora for its [own] interests. Bahrain [has] suffered as Qatar [has] not take[n up the spirit of] good neighhbourliness. We have good ties, family ties [with Qatar]. However, Qatar [is] supporting instability in Bahrain through financing terrorist group... or through [its] media to spread false news in order to create chaos[...,]with more than 800 false news [reports. And it is hiding behind freedom of expression and freedom of [the] media. [Conversely] Bahrain long respects free media. Democracy [is] in Bahrain. We have a fully elected parliament and [we] let [our] parliament carry out its work. Therefore, all these achievements [that] are non existent in Qatar...their constitution has no parliament. [We do] not interfere, it is their choice. However, [we] believe [that the] reform process is part of a democratic process. [We would like to] remind our brethren in Qatar [that it is] easy to criticise others, but [one] should first look at yourself.\\" Qatar then used its second Right of Reply to respond (through a translator) to Bahrain in saying that it is \\"regrettable for Bahrain to launch an attack on Qatar. These false llegations [up]on Qatar [are also] unjust measures on Qatar. [They] amount to a violation of human rights and the right of expressing opinions. [This] also runs counter to counter-terrorism based on human rights. One cannot fight terror without respect for human rights. [The group of four aforementioned Arab states] accuse[s us] of terror but [has provided] no evidence; these four [member states] provide no evidence as none is there. Qatar is better than all four [states] in the field of counter-terrorism. The[y] are against human rights, includ[ing] le[a]d[ing] to [a] cut in family ties. Any allegation [that] Qatar interefered in the internal of these countries are false. Indeed, [it is] obscuring these countries interefer[ing] in our internal affairs. [This] campaign threaten the unity of Qatar. These countries [need to] pay attention to their own unity and human rights. To ensure the stability of the [Persian] Gulf [Arab states] we need the cooperation of Gulf states. As [we are] not able to take a third right of reply, [we would] like to present further comments in writing.\\" The session was then closed for the day by the president of the General Assembly. 25 September ;Morning schedule * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Rodolfo Nin Novoa * ‚Äì (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Secretary for Relations with States Paul Richard Gallagher * ‚Äì Permanent Representative Antonio Gumande * ‚Äì Permanent Representative Ismael A.

It is regrettable of the comments [in regards to] Rakhine state . [The term] genocide should not be used easily. Let me be clear, [there is] no ethnic cleansing, no genocide. We will do everything to prevent ethnic cleansing. We will not dwell...as our vice president has already spoken...We condemn all such violations. We condemn the attack on the police station....[even] the highest Islamic organisation in Myanmar has also condemned the attack. [It is] not just Muslim...most of the world is unaware of the plight of [Muslim], Buddhist and Hindu groups [in the country]. [The] evil nature of terrorist groups was revealed yesterday when Hindu groups were attacked. Today 93 bodies were revealed when Hindu villages were attacked. We must stand together...most [people] were forced to flee. Many villagers were forces to flee to Bangladesh so as to exploit international attention. Villages though to be with the government have been under attack. The government is striving...to ensure aid is being received...[so] too [are] humanitarian organisations.

[We are] also reaching out to Bangladesh [resolve he situation].\\" Iran responded (through a translator) to Saudi Arabia and UAE in saying that \\"on Friday (22 September) [they] made several unfounded allegations to Iran...and [they are responsible] for spreading taqfiri terrorism. Saudi Arabia and UAE have the audacity to accuse Iran of spreading terrorism and [being] against inteference in the internal affairs [of other countries...[It is they who are] against [the] basic human rights of [the] Bahraini people.

Originally intended for rescue operations, it was sent on an experimental mission to the International Space Station in 2019. FEDOR is a Russian given male name and an acronym for \\"Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research\\". History The robot, originally called Avatar, was funded by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and intended for rescue operations but its role was later expanded to include space missions. The new name, FEDOR, was announced in 2017 by then Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin. FEDOR is intended to be a platform for development of a series of robots, although the first model was often called FEDOR in news media. In April 2017, a video of FEDOR shooting guns caused a media alarm. Rogozin insisted Russia was not creating a Terminator. After the video was posted, one of the parts suppliers cancelled their relationship with the project. On 22 August 2019, a FEDOR robot was launched on Soyuz MS-14 to the International Space Station. The plan was for the robot to spend a week and a half aboard the orbital outpost. The model going to space was given the name Skybot F-850. On 24 August 2019, the Soyuz failed to dock as scheduled with the station, due to a fault with its rendezvous system. On 27 August 2019, it successfully docked with the Zvezda module of the station. On 30 August 2019, FEDOR successfully matched plug connectors while weightless, simulating the repair of cables on the station's exterior surface during a spacewalk. On 6 September 2019, the reentry capsule of the Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft, with FEDOR on board but no crew, landed in the designated area in the steppes of Kazaskhtan, south-east of the city of Zhezkazghan.¬∑¬∑ On 11 September 2019, \\"Russian robot Fedor cannot fulfill his mission to replace human astronauts on space walks\\", Yevgeny Dudorov, executive director of robot developers Androidnaya Tekhnika said.¬∑ On 14 December 2019, Russia's Androidnaya Tekhnika SPA ¬´Android Technics¬ª and Japan's GITAI‚Äì Robotics Startup for Space Development startup plan to create a robot to operate on the lunar surface, the Russian company's executive director, Yevgeny Dudorov, told TASS.

After attacking his victims, Lloyd stole their footwear and jewellery to keep as trophies. Lloyd was known to be active during the 1980s, and was arrested in 2006 after a familial DNA profile linked him to the crimes. He pleaded guilty to four rapes and two attempted rapes, and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Crimes For a period of a least four years during the 1980s, a man violently attacked and raped at least four lone women and attempted to assault at least two others in the Rotherham area. His victims were aged between 18 and 54 and were typically attacked during the early hours of the morning while returning from a night out. During the attacks the perpetrator carried stockings and tights to use as a mask and to tie up his victims. The offender always stole the shoes from his victims; he also often stole their jewellery and perfume. While several suspects were identified and interviewed at the time, the case grew cold. The crimes were featured on the BBC Television programme Crimewatch, which prompted 350 names being provided to authorities. Lloyd was not among those named. Re-opening of investigation Following advancements in genetic profiling and forensic science, South Yorkshire Police re-opened the case in 2001. Investigators produced a list of just over 40 individuals possibly related to the rapist, based on their DNA profiles. Police spoke to Lloyd's sister, who had provided a DNA sample after a prior drink-driving offence. After learning that the police were investigating him, Lloyd attempted to hang himself. The suicide attempt failed when he was found by his son. At the time he came to the attention of the police, James Lloyd was a married father of two living in the village of Thurnscoe, in South Yorkshire. He was a manager at Dearne Valley Printers, a printing firm in Wath upon Dearne. Police raided his home and the printing firm he managed and found over 100 pairs of women's shoes, both new and used, as well as hundreds of tights and stockings. Police also found a document titled \\"The Perfect Victim\\" which detailed identical crimes to the ones committed by Lloyd, although it was unclear if it was written by Lloyd.  Arrest and conviction  In April 2006, Lloyd was arrested and charged. He pleaded guilty to four rapes and two attempted rapes in July 2006, but denied responsibility for one other rape. Lloyd was initially sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for just under fifteen years. Lloyd successfully appealed against the severity of his sentence, with judges at the Court of Appeal reducing his minimum term to seven years and 263 days. After Lloyd's conviction, Detective Inspector Angie Wright stated \\"Obviously he had a fetish. There may well be other victims who have not come forward and some of the shoes may belong to other victims which were stolen at the time. Some are brand new but we know he took some from his victims to keep as sort of trophies. Some of the victims were able to identify the shoes that had been taken.\\" Police have stated they believe Lloyd may have had as many as 120 victims. Aftermath Detective Inspector Sue Hickman was awarded first prize in the Crime Investigation category at the Airwave Police Professional Awards in 2007 for her work on the case. The 2011 Peter James novel Dead Like You is based on the case. In an interview with the Telegraph, James said he was \\"instantly drawn\\" to the shoe rapist case as inspiration for a novel which would \\"explore the subject of rape from all perspectives, from that of the perpetrator, the victim and the police.\\" An episode of the CBS Reality series Written in Blood aired in 2017 explores the crime and the efforts to bring Lloyd to justice.

It was founded in 1938 as an apprentice-base learning workshop. Curricula established to meet educational standards set by the government were implemented in 1979. In 1997, the legislature created the Pablo Antonio Cuadra Nicaraguan Center for Artistic Education () to direct artistic education and development of Nicaraguan arts and established separate national schools for circus arts, dance, music, theater and visual arts. History Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes was founded in 1938, in Managua, Nicaragua by the sculptor Genaro Amador Lira. It operated as a workshop, where students collaborated as apprentices on commissions Amador secured to finance the school and sporadically held art history lectures. It was located on the west side of the Central Park in a home that formerly belonged to President Carlos Jos√© Sol√≥rzano. The house was a large two-story building surrounding a central courtyard and also served as the home of the School of Dance, Theater and Visual Arts (). Lira drew from European influences, teaching students classical, mannerist and modernist sculptural styles, based on the works of Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. Many of his works were human figures of monumental size dedicated to glorifying the national and religious iconography of the country. Edith Gr√∏n was a student of Lira who studied sculpture at the school and during her tenure, Roberto de la Selva and Fernando Saravia were fellow students. In 1948 was appointed director of the school. He had a background in painting and had studied abroad in Madrid, Mexico City, New York City and Rome. Students who graduated during Pe√±alba's leadership included , Alejandro Canales, C√©sar Caracas, P√©rez Carrillo, Noel Flores Castro, Arnoldo Guill√©n, Genaro Lugo, Silvio Miranda, Carlos Montenegro, , Fernando Saravia, Luis Urbina, Julio Vallejos Ugarte, Leonel Vanegas and Pedro Vargas. In 1972, the property was destroyed in the earthquake and in 1973, Pe√±alba left. The painter, Sergio D√°vila took over the direction of the school in 1974. Without a permanent home, the school moved often until 1975, when D√°vila secured a donated property in the Dambach Neighborhood of Managua from owners who had emigrated from the country. The location was shared with the National Museum of Cultural Heritage and offered only courses in visual arts and music. In 1979, D√°vila was replaced when a new policy on culture was instituted by the government. For the first time, the state established material and courses for teaching visual arts and hired Cuban professors to formalize a program to teach ceramics, engraving, painting and sculpture. A workshop on murals developed in 1983. They established an autonomous facility in the Ministry of Culture, but in 1988, it closed and students rejoined the National School of Fine Arts. In 1984, Alejandro Ar√≥stegui founded the David Alfaro Siqueiros National School of Public- Monumental Art (), to address the fact that most of the public artworks in the country were being created using acrylic paints, a media which is impermanent in the tropical climate. The idea behind the school was to create public art, integrating architecture, crafts, painting and sculptural techniques for urban spaces. By merging the concepts of the Italian Renaissance schools, the German Bauhaus approach to design, and the Mexican Siqueiros Experimental Workshops, the school was operated with funds provided by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When the funding ceased in 1987, the school was only able to survive for one or two more years, officially closing in 1989. In 1997, the legislature created the Pablo Antonio Cuadra Nicaraguan Center for Artistic Education () as an institution to direct artistic education and development of Nicaraguan art. The center coordinates curricula for the Lu√≠s Abraham Delgadillo National School of Music (); the Rodrigo Pe√±alba National School of Visual Arts (); the Adan Castillo National Dance School (); the Pilar Aguirre National Theater School (); and the National School of Circus Arts ().

Its borders faced the Bay of Bengal to its west, the Indian subcontinent to its north and Burma proper to its east. The Arakan Mountains isolated the region and made it accessible only by sea. The region now forms the Rakhine State in Myanmar. Arakan became one of the earliest regions in Southeast Asia to embrace Dharmic religions, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. Islam arrived with Arab merchants in the 8th century. The Kingdom of Mrauk U emerged as an independent Arakanese kingdom for 300 years. During the Age of Discovery and Bengal Subah's major economic development, Arakan caught the interest of the Dutch East India Company and the Portuguese Empire. In the middle of the 17th century, it was dominated by the Islamic Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Arakan steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss to the Mughal Empire. After conquest by the British East India Company, Arakan became one of the divisions of British India and received settlers from the neighboring Chittagong Division of the Bengal Presidency. In 1937, it became a division of British Burma. Arakan Division was once a leading rice exporter. During the Second World War, the region was occupied by Imperial Japan. The Allied Forces liberated Arakan during the Burma Campaign. It continued to be an administrative division after Burmese independence; and later became a province. In the early 1960s, the northern part of Arakan was governed from Rangoon as the Mayu Frontier District. In 1982, the Burmese nationality law stripped many inhabitants of the region of their citizenship. In 1989, the Burmese military junta changed the official name of Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name of Arakan State to Rakhine State ‚Äî a name reflecting the dominance of the Rakhine majority. Many in the Rohingya minority strongly opposed the move. The region has seen conflict between the Burmese state, Rakhine nationalists and Rohingya rebels. In more recent times, Rakhine State has been notable for the exodus of refugees into neighboring countries because of military operations by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army). Etymology Claudius Ptolemy identified Arakan as Argyr√©. Portuguese records spelled the name as Arracao. The name was spelled as Araccan in many old European maps and publications. The region was named as Arakan Division during British rule in Burma. Other names Early Arab traders were familiar with the Indian name of Rohang as the name of Arakan. Burmese tradition holds the name of the region to be Rakhaing. History Early inhabitants It is unclear who the earliest inhabitants were; some historians believe the earliest settlers included the Burmese Mro tribe but there is a lack of evidence and no clear tradition of their origin or written records of their history. Burmese traditional history holds that Arakan was inhabited by the Rakhine since 3000 BCE. But there is no archaeological evidence to support the claim. According to British historian Daniel George Edward Hall, who wrote extensively on the history of Burma, \\"The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century AD. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal. All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern Akyab\\".D. G. E Hall, A History of South East Asia, New York, 1968, P. 389. Ancient Indic influence A map showing Arakan as a neighbor to the kingdoms of the Ganges delta in 200 CE A map showing Arakan as a neighbor to the Indian Gupta Empire in 400 CE Arakan came under strong Indic influence from the Indian subcontinent, particularly the ancient kingdoms of the Ganges delta. Arakan was one of the first regions in Southeast Asia to adopt Dharmic religions. It became one of the earliest Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia. Buddhist missionaries from the Mauryan Empire traveled through Arakan to other parts of Southeast Asia. First states Due to the evidence of Sanskrit inscriptions found in the region, historians believe the founders of the first Arakanese state were Indian. The first Arakanese state flourished in Dhanyawadi between the 4th and 6th centuries. Sircar has dated King Chandrodaya at the start of 3rd century AD and there are king which are mentioned even prior to him. It is concluded that from King Chandrodaya a new religion of Buddhism took root in Arakan as the prior kings are regarded less religious compard to the later. The city was the center of a large trade network linked to India, China and Persia. Power then shifted to the city of Waithali, where the Candra dynasty ruled. Waithali became a wealthy trading port. The Chandra-ruled Harikela state was known as the Kingdom of Ruhmi to the Arabs. Arrival of Islam Since in the 8th century, Arab merchants began conducting missionary activities, and many locals converted to Islam. Some researchers have speculated that Muslims used trade routes in the region to travel to India and China. A southern branch of the Silk Road connected India, Burma and China since the neolithic period. Many Arab merchants married local women and settled in Arakan. As a result of intermarriage and conversion, the Muslim population in Arakan grew.Andrew T. H. Tan (2009). A Handbook of Terrorism and Insurgency in Southeast Asia. Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 327. Rakhine migration It is also unclear that the Rakhine people were one of the tribes of the Burmese Pyu city-states because Pyus are not related with Burmese ethnic. They began migrating to Arakan through the Arakan Mountains in the 9th century. The Rakhines settled in the valley of the Lemro River. Their cities included Sambawak I, Pyinsa, Parein, Hkrit, Sambawak II, Myohaung, Toungoo and Launggret. The cities flourished between the 11th and 15th centuries. The Burmese invaded Arakan in 1406. Indo-Islamic influence Arakan under the Bengal Sultanate in the 15th century After the Burmese invasion, Min Saw Mon fled to Gaurh in the Bengal Sultanate, where he stayed in exile for 24 years after being granted asylum by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah. The Bengal Sultanate was one of the major Islamic states established after the Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent. In 1430, Min Saw Mon regained control of Arakan with help from the Bengal Sultanate. He established his new capital in the city of Mrauk U. Arakan became a vassal state of the Bengal Sultanate and recognized Bengali sovereignty over some territory of northern Arakan. Arakanese kings adopted Islamic titles and struck the Bengali taka. Min Saw Mon was styled as Suleiman Shah. Bengalis settled in Arakan and formed their settlements. Kingdom of Mrauk U Mrauk U Kingdom in the 17th century Min Saw Mon's successors in the Kingdom of Mrauk U sought to end the Bengal Sultanate's hegemony. Min Khayi (Ali Khan) was the first to challenge Bengali hegemony. Ba Saw Phyu (Kalima Shah) defeated Bengal Sultan Rukunuddin Barbak Shah in 1459. Min Bin (Zabuk Shah) conquered Chittagong. Taking advantage of the Mughal Empire's invasion campaign of Bengal, the Arakan navy and pirates dominated a coastline of 1000 miles, spanning from the Sundarbans to Moulmein. The kingdom's coastline was frequented by Arab, Dutch, Danish and Portuguese traders. Control of the Kaladan River and Lemro River valleys led to increased international trade, making Mrauk U prosperous. The reigns of Min Phalaung (Sikender Shah), Min Rajagiri (Salim Shah I) and grandson Min Khamaung (Hussein Shah) strengthened the wealth and power of Mrauk U. Arakan colluded in the slave trade with the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong. After conquering the port city of Syriam in the early 1600s, Arakan appointed the Portuguese mercenary Philip De Brito e Nicota as the governor of Syriam. But Nicota later transferred Syriam to the authority of Portuguese India. The old city wall of Mrauk U Even after independence from the Sultans of Bengal, the Arakanese kings continued the custom of maintaining Muslim titles. They compared themselves to Sultans and fashioned themselves after Mughal rulers. They also continued to employ Indians and Muslims in prestigious positions within the royal administration. The court adopted Indian and Islamic fashions from neighbouring Bengal. Mrauk U hosted mosques, temples, shrines, seminaries and libraries. Syed Alaol was a renowned poet of Arakan. Indian and Muslim influence continued on Arakanese affairs for 350 years. In 1660, Shah Shuja, the brother of Emperor Aurangzeb and a claimant of the Peacock Throne, received asylum in Mrauk U. Members of Shuja's entourage were recruited in the Arakanese army and court. They were kingmakers in Arakan until the Burmese conquest. Arakan suffered a major defeat to the forces of Mughal Bengal during the Battle of Chittagong in 1666, when Mrauk U lost control of southeast Bengal. The Mrauk U dynasty's reign continued until the 18th century. Burmese conquest The Konbaung Dynasty conquered Arakan in 1784. Mrauk U was devastated during the invasion. The Burmese Empire executed thousands of men and deported a considerable portion of people from the Arakanese population to central Burma. British Empire British Arakan Division in 1931 The Burmese Empire ceded Arakan to the British East India Company in the 1826 Treaty of Yandabo. Arakan became one of the divisions of British India. Initially governed as part of the Bengal Presidency, it received many settlers from neighboring Chittagong Division. The settlers became influential in commerce, agriculture and shipping. In 1937, Arakan became part of Burma Province, which was separated from India into a distinct crown colony. During World War II, Arakan endured the Japanese occupation of Burma. The Burma National Army and the pro-British V Force were active in the region. Sectarian tensions flared during the Arakan massacres in 1942. Japanese rule ended with the successful Burma Campaign by Allied forces. During British rule, Arakan Division was one of the largest rice exporters in the world. The division's seaport and capital Akyab were dominated by Arakanese Indians, which caused tension with Arakanese Burmese. Both groups were represented as natives in the Legislative Council of Burma and the Legislature of Burma. In the 1940s, Arakanese Muslims appealed to Muhammad Ali Jinnah to incorporate the townships of the Mayu River valley into the Dominion of Pakistan. Burmese independence Arakan became one of the Union of Burma's divisions after independence from British rule. Burma was a parliamentary democracy until the 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat. The northern part of Arakan was governed by the central government in Rangoon in the early 1960s. Known as the Mayu Frontier District, it covered townships near the border with East Pakistan. In 1982, the Burmese junta enacted the Burmese nationality law which did not recognize Arakanese Indians as one of Burma's ethnic groups, thereby stripping them of their citizenship. In 1989, the Burmese government altered the country's name from Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the State Peace and Development Council changed the name of Arakan State to Rakhine State. The province was renamed after the Rakhine ethnic group. However, the new name is not accepted as legitimate by many in both the Rakhine and Rohingya communities, instead preferring the historical term Arakan. Rakhine-led groups like the Arakan Liberation Army have sought independence for the region. Other groups, including the Arakan Rohingya National Organization, have demanded autonomy. The region witnessed military crackdowns during Operation King Dragon in 1978; in 1991 and 1992 after the 8888 uprising and 1990 Burmese general election; the 2012 Rakhine State riots, the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis and Rohingya persecution in Myanmar (2016-present). Geography Maungdaw District by the banks of the Naf River. The Arakan Mountains separated Arakan from Bengal and Burma proper, and thus the region was accessible only by sea for centuries Arakan is a coastal geographic region in Lower Burma. It comprises a long narrow strip of land along the eastern seaboard of the Bay of Bengal and stretches from the Naf River estuary on the border of the Chittagong Hills area (in Bangladesh) in the north to the Gwa River in the south. The Arakan region is about 400 miles (640 km) long from north to south and is about 90 miles (145 km) wide at its broadest. The Arakan Mountains (also called Arakan Yoma), a range that forms the eastern boundary of the region, isolates Arakan from the rest of Burma. The coast has several sizable offshore islands, including Cheduba and Ramree. The region's principal rivers are the NƒÅf estuary and the Mayu, Kaladan, and Lemro rivers. One-tenth of Arakan's generally hilly land is cultivated. Rice is the dominant crop in the delta areas, where most of the population is concentrated. Other crops include fruits, chilies, dha and tobacco. The main towns are coastal and include Sittwe (Akyab), Sandoway, Kyaukpyu and Taungup. Demographics The people of Arakan have historically been called the Arakanese. The population consists of Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans. Tibeto-Burman Arakanese mostly speak the Arakanese language, also known as Rakhine and closely related to Burmese. Most Indo-Aryan Arakanese speak the Rohingya language. Other languages spoken by smaller communities in Rakhine state include the Tibeto-Burman Chak, Asho Chin, Ekai, Kumi, Laitu, Mru, Songlai, Sumtu and Uppu, as well as the Indo- Aryan Chakma.

It chronicles various case studies of jihadist terrorism within the United States. The book served as the basis for a 2016 HBO documentary, Homegrown: The Counter-Terror Dilemma.Homegrown: The Counter-Terror Dilemma Home Box Office, Inc. Summary Peter Bergen‚Äôs United States of Jihad provides an authoritative overview of one of the most discussed‚Äîyet misunderstood‚Äîtopics: jihadist terrorism in the United States. As Bergen notes in Jihad, some 360 Americans have been charged with jihadist terrorism crimes in the US since the September 11 attacks. As a result of those attacks, public opinion has, at times, viewed terrorism as an existential threat to the US. One of the standout points in Jihad is: of the 360 people who have been prosecuted for jihadist terrorism offenses since 9/11, an overwhelming 80% were US persons- meaning that they were either citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States at the time. This stands in stark contrast to the presumption by some that persons of the Islamic faith who originate from outside the US are the primary jihadist threat. Indeed, as Bergen shows, Americans like Anwar al-Awlaki, Adam Gadahn, Omar Hammami, and David Headley have had prominent roles in foreign terrorist organizations. Awlaki‚Äôs radical sermons have been directly tied to nearly a quarter of American jihadist cases, Bergen says. Additionally, a number of American Muslims have chosen to leave, or have attempted to leave, the US in order to join a foreign terrorist organization. Others have provided financial support to these groups. Bergen‚Äôs examination of American jihadists finds that they are largely middle class and typically well educated. Some, like Major Nidal Hasan, would grow up with the quintessential American lifestyle, before experiencing a ‚Äúcognitive opening‚Äù that turned them towards militant Islam. Bergen finds that in Hasan‚Äôs case, it was the deaths of his parents that provided this opening, as their deaths caused him to become more pious. This in turn ultimately led to Hasan‚Äôs deadly 2009 assault at Fort Hood, Texas. On another front, Bergen shows how the greatest menace to the US homeland is posed, not by centralized groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, but rather by lone wolf attackers, such as the Tsarnaev brothers, whose terrorist attacks in 2013 paralyzed Boston‚Äôs residents with fear. These jihadists visit terrorist websites and learn how to carry out attacks in the US. As social media and encrypted chat applications continue to grow, recruiters take full advantage of their anonymity and continue to seek out more recruits for further attacks. Their decentralized operations are difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to stop, and the terrorist organizations are aware of this. Despite the massive surveillance efforts on the part of the intelligence community, Bergen finds that in the cases of the 360 individuals he examined for Jihad, ‚Äúsurveillance of American phone data had no discernible role in preventing acts of terrorism and only a marginal role in preventing terrorist- related activity, such as fund-raising.‚Äù Reception United States of Jihad has been well-received, with former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano declaring that ‚ÄúBergen‚Äôs book is the best one-volume treatment available on the current state of jihad in America.‚ÄùJanet Napolitano Reviews Peter Bergen‚Äôs ‚ÄòUnited States of Jihad‚Äô The New York Times Michiko Kakutani writes that Bergen's \\"profiles of jihadists . . . leave the reader with a harrowing appreciation of the banality of evil and an unnerving sense of missteps made by the authorities\\" and \\"Mr. Bergen‚Äôs detailed accounts of terror plots (both executed, foiled or failed) make for chilling reading.\\"Review: Peter Bergen‚Äôs ‚ÄòUnited States of Jihad‚Äô Surveys Homegrown Terrorism The New York Times Walter Mead states Bergen has written \\"what in effect are two books about terrorism.

Region  Verbena stricta is native to Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. Because if its versatility and hardiness it is even more widespread spread with the only states without this species including Oregon, California, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. It is mostly found in meadows, fields, Dry sandy soils and anthropogenic biomes which include man-made or disturbed habitats. Due to the habitats Verbena stricta lives in, it is an extremely drought resistant and non-aggressive species.  Plant Structure   Growth  In ideal growing conditions it can grow up to 2'-4' with a spike topping the plant. This spike includes a densely packed cluster of ¬Ω-inch flowers.  Flower  The flowers can bloom in a variety of colors with the majority of flower as a purple or lavender shade with the rare rose pink or white shade appearing. The flower includes five petals fused at the base forming a short tube. The petal lobes are unequal in size and length with the two later lobes being the largest and a notched lobe at the top of the bottom lobe. As the plant ages the spike atop the plant will elongate. The Spike topping the plant will eventually seed and encapsulate tiny nutlets. The fruit are usually 2‚Äì3 mm in length when ripe.  Leaves  The leaves are on average two to three inches long with an opposite pattern along the stalk of the plant. The leaves have a heavy serrated edge with an oval to egg shape and a pointed tip. All leaves are covered in a dense hair and are completely stalk-less. The stems of this plant are square and are as well covered in short dense hair. The base of the stem can include a reddish color.  Season  Verbena stricta blooms in the early summer and stays flowering through the late late summer until its seeds ripen.  Benefits  Verbena stricta is an extremely important component of many butterfly gardens as the leaves are the ideal food for the larval form of the common buckeye butterfly. The seeds are also an important dietary portion of many small birds and mammals.

On 2 April he gave another speech, answering eleven questions which had been posed.Baluze, p. 1349. He was Master of Requests by 1382.Baluze, p. 1349. He served as Secretary of Memorials for King Charles. He was recommended to Pope Gregory XI by Duke Jean of Berri (Bourges) in 1377, with a view to the Archbishopric of Vienne, but the post had already gone elsewhere.Baluze I, p. 1348. Cardella, p. 360.

Despite the brief tenure, he was known thereafter as the Cardinal of Maillezais. In October 1385 he accompanied his patron Duke John of Berri to Toulouse. The Diary of Bishop Jean le Fevre of Chartres indicates that, on his return from Toulouse, Pierre spent the next three years continuously at the Curia in Avignon.Baluze, p. 1349. During the winter of 1389, Cardinal de Thury was sent by Pope Clement VII to the royal court in Paris to brief the King on the critical state of affairs in Naples, and on the efforts of Joanna I of Naples, the widow of Charles of Durazzo, to keep control for her adopted son Louis d'Anjou. He departed the Curia in Avignon on 16 January, and returned on 19 June 1389.Eubel, p. 28, note 7. The Cardinal also held conversations with Marie of Blois, Duchess of Anjou, the widow of Louis I of Naples and mother of Louis d'Anjou.

Adams, Sede Vacante 1394, retrieved: 2017-09-17. Reign of Benedict XIII In 1395 French leaders and a number of courtiers of the Papal Curia set out to persuade Benedict XIII that, for the sake of peace and the union of the Church, he should agree to resign the papacy, if his competitor Boniface IX could be persuaded to do the same (\\"The Way of Cession\\"). Many difficulties stood in the way. The French leaders then tried to persuade the cardinals in a private meeting to adopt the view which had been arrived at the royal Court. Thury was of the opinion that reducing Boniface to obedience to the Avignon pope was a better way, but, that if Boniface could be persuaded to resign, the plan of the Court was acceptable. When the embassy had returned to Paris, a number of courtiers at Avignon began to work on the cardinals to retract their agreements. The King, however, wrote a strong letter to the cardinals to stand firm, to which Thury wrote a reply on 12 October stating that he would never retract, and that he wished that the King would try the \\"Via Cessionis\\" as soon as possible, for the good of the Church.Baluze, pp. 1350-1351. After frustrating years of inaction on the part of both popes, the Cardinals at Avignon decided to take action. On 1 September 1398 at Villeneuve eighteen cardinals published the retraction of their obedience to Benedict XIII. One of them was Pierre de Thury.Baluze, p. 1351. Martin de Alpartils, Chronica Actitatorum I (Paderborn 1906) (ed. Ehrle) p. 35. In January 1399 the cardinals of the Avignon Obedience sent three representatives to Paris, Cardinal Guy de Malsec, Cardinal Pierre de Thury, and Cardinal Amadeo di Saluzzo, to lay before the royal Court their complaints against Benedict XIII. Cardinal de Thury acted as their spokesman in accusing Benedict of being a promoter of heresy, a perjurer, and a person of dissolute morals. They asked that he be deposed and imprisoned, and that the King invite other monarchs to withdraw their obedience from him. Their proposal met with little approval.Religieux de Saint Denis, Book XIX chapter xii: Two of the cardinals returned to Avignon in July, but Thury remained in Paris. He presided at the marriage of the Comte de Clermont, son of Louis the Duke of Bourbon, and the Comtesse d'Eu on 24 June 1400 in the royal palace in Paris. On 29 April 1403 the cardinals finally made their peace with Benedict XIII and returned to his obedience. Cardinals Malsec and Saluzzo were sent to Paris to inform the King. Cardinal Thury and Patriarch Simon de Cramaud were opposed to the reconciliation, but finally went to the King and submitted.Religieux de Saint Denis, Book XXIV, chapter iv-vii; Volume III (ed. Bellaguet), pp. 84-91, 98. In the Spring of 1407, Pierre de Thury was one of several cardinals appointed by Benedict XIII to deal with an embassy from Gregory XII, which had come to France to attempt to agree upon a place where the two popes could meet and resolve the schism.Religieux de Saint Denis, Book XXVIII, chapters i-ii; Volume III (ed.

Location The institute is located in the central business district of Blantyre, Malawi's second-largest city. MJC is located on the grounds of \\"Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital\\", the largest public hospital in Blantyre, to which it is affiliated. It is also within walking distance to the University of Malawi College of Medicine, which uses the 1,000-bed Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital as its teaching hospital. Overview This institute was developed by Raising Malawi, a non-government organization, founded by Madonna, in collaboration with the Malawian health ministry, to provide intensive care services for children and increase the number of pediatric surgeries performed at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital. The Mercy James Centre is a modern, fully equipped pediatric surgery and intensive care unit at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in the city of Blantyre, Malawi‚Äôs commercial and financial center. Prior to the opening of MJC, the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital had less than ten intensive care beds. The entire country of 17 million people, of whom 15 percent were aged less that 15 years, had less than five pediatric surgeons. The new institute addresses both those problems. It serves as a teaching facility for Malawian pediatric surgeons. History Plans to construct this institute were first made public in November 2014. Construction of the buildings started in 2015 and the hospital was officially opened on 11 July 2017.

In the 2018 season, the team was known as the Atlanta Havoc. History The franchise announced themselves as the Atlanta Havoc, an expansion team who were charter members of the new American Arena League (AAL) on September 10, 2017. The team was added to the AAL on September 22 where it was revealed the owner was Tim Viens, who already owned the Vermont Bucks in the AAL until he sold that team in December 2017. The team also announced that they would play their inaugural 2018 season out of the Buford Arena, a local arena used by Buford High School, in Buford, Georgia. On April 14, 2018, founder and majority owner Tim Viens stepped away from the team. After going undefeated for the first six league games, the Havoc initially lost their first game due to a forfeit to the Cape Fear Heroes for not having their field goal posts ready for their home game on May 26. The team appealed the forfeit claiming the opponent did not wait long enough before leaving; the forfeit loss was expunged from the Havoc's record, while the walkover win was still awarded to the Heroes. The Havoc were then allowed to schedule another league game for the following week, traveled to play the Carolina Energy instead of their non-league home game against the Peach State Cats, and lost their first actual game 45‚Äì41. The Havoc also lost the following game, and last regular season, to the Georgia Doom, dropping to the second seed for the playoffs. However, the third-seeded Doom then opted out of participating in the playoffs, leading to a scheduled match-up against the Heroes at home. The league then announced that the Heroes would host the semifinal game instead despite retaining the third seed. The Havoc would win the semifinal game over the Heroes 61‚Äì54 to face the top-seeded Richmond Roughriders in the AAL championship. They defeated the Roughriders 58‚Äì50. On July 26, 2018, general manager Josh Resignalo announced they had signed a one- year lease to play at the Florence Center in Florence, South Carolina. The team was rebranded as the Carolina Havoc. Resignalo also took over head coaching responsibilities as Boo Mitchell stayed in Georgia and was named general manager of the Peach State Cats. However, on September 29, Resignalo announced that he stepped down as head coach and general manager of the Carolina Havoc to take a new position as assistant coach of the National Arena League's defending champion Carolina Cobras. Steven Smith was then named the general manager and then former defensive lineman Anson Yarbourough was named the head coach. The team would go on to sign a number of indoor and arena football veterans which included quarterback Daryl Clark, wide receivers Thyron Lewis and Rashad Carter and defensive back Micheaux Robinson. Later on in free agency, they would set a president as they signed the first international player in the short history of the American Arena League in Scottish national Cameron Craig. The Carolina Havoc would go on to a 7‚Äì1 regular season, with their only loss coming against the Carolina Energy, including three wins over non-league members. The Havoc then won their divisional playoff game over the Cape Fear Heroes before losing again to the Energy in the league semifinal game. After the season ended, the Florence Center unanimously voted to not renew the Havoc's lease for 2020 citing very low attendance. General manager Steven Smith then resigned in October 2019 and sued the team over unpaid salary adding up to more than $32,000. Head coach Anson Yarbourough then joined former general manager Josh Resignalo with the Carolina Cobras as a defensive coordinator.

The center opened in 1999 on the site of the former Winter Park Mall.  History  The site was originally home to Winter Park Mall, which was Greater Orlando's first enclosed shopping mall. The mall opened in 1964 and had Ivey's and J. C. Penney as the original anchor stores. At the time, the J. C. Penney store was the second-largest in the nation. Ivey's was sold to Dillard's in 1990. Over the years, the mall lost popularity, as many shoppers preferred the Park Avenue, Winter Park's upscale shopping district, or newer malls in the area. J. C. Penney moved to Orlando Fashion Square in 1993 leaving Dillard's as the only anchor store. At the time, developers had begun seeking replacements for the J. C. Penney store, with prospective replacements including Belk and Parisian. After this, the mall‚Äôs owners sold the property to Don M. Casto, who had plans for a redevelopment of the property starting in 1997. The mall was razed in 1998 except for the Dillard's store. However, Dillard's did not renew its lease in 1999, and the store was redeveloped. Winter Park Village was officially dedicated on November 15, 1999, but some stores and restaurants such as Borders and P. F. Chang's China Bistro opened as early as March. The empty Dillard's building was divided into smaller spaces to house The Cheesecake Factory and Guitar Center on the lower level and 58 loft apartments on the upper level. The new center also included a new Albertsons supermarket and a Regal Cinemas. Albertsons closed in 2008 and was replaced with Publix. Borders closed in 2011 after the company decided to close all stores, and the building was demolished and replaced with two smaller buildings housing Chase and Starbucks.

It was published in the March 2003 issue of Science Fiction World. Plot Yiyi, a poet, Big-tooth, an ambassador, and Li Bai, also a poet, are travelling on a yacht to the South Pole. Ten years ago, Big-tooth went with Yiyi to meet the \\"god\\" that had recently appeared in the solar system. They meet the god, who is in the form of a sphere floating above a plane, in space. Yiyi is almost killed by the god, but the poems he has catch the god's interest. After reading a few of the poems, the god almost kills Yiyi again, but is again interested in him after he says that poetry is an unsurpassable art form. Both Big-tooth and the god think that technology can surpass all, but Yiyi insists that poetry is a representation of the human soul. The god then takes a sample of Yiyi's genes and becomes human, explaining after that he does this with every species he meets to truly understand their art form. The god calls himself Li Bai, after the poet Li Bai, and then declares that there are to ways to surpass the original Li Bai: to create poems better than him, or to create all possible poems. Li Bai thus starts constructing the Poetry Cloud, which will create and store all possible poems. To accomplish this requires the destruction of the sun and most of solar system for material, although. After hollowing out the Earth to use as material, Li Bai returns humans and some of the dinosaurs to it, creating along with it a white hole to provide light. The story then returns to Yiyi, Big-tooth, and Li Bai on the yacht. When they reach the South Pole, they use the Earth's gravity to go to space to see the Poetry Cloud. When the three of them see the poetry cloud, Li Bai starts to lament on how technology cannot appreciate poetry. This is after his attempt at writing a poetry recognition software. Big-tooth questions if technology can reach the essence of intelligent life. Before leaving, Li Bai gives Big-tooth and Yiyi chips containing all of the poems that mention their names. Themes The tension between technology and humanism is the main subject of \\"The Poetry Cloud\\". The three main characters, Yiyi, Big-tooth, and Li Bai, represent the three different viewpoints in regard to the debate between technology and humanism. Yiyi represents those who think that one can only understand the world using poetic aesthetics, and that technology could make humans lose the spirituality required to understand aesthetics. This is alike to the perspective of Confucian humanists. Big-tooth represents those who think that technology is a powerful force. Liu uses his portrayal of Big-tooth to expose how science has its limitations. The final character, Li Bai, represents the intermediary of Yiyi and Bigtooth's viewpoints. He represents Liu's thought that humanism and technology should complement each other; that both are useful. This is also reflected in the conclusion of the story; how technology cannot capture the essence of poetry. Another idea that is espoused by Liu is that there are too many creative constraints in Chinese science fiction. This is shown in a paragraph where Li Bai dismisses eliminating poems that do not follow classic Chinese prosody. Reception \\"The Poetry Cloud\\" is held in high regard by readers.

It is certainly the highest church on Exmoor. History The church has no known dedication to any saint, however an inscription on one of the three bells suggests it may have been dedicated to Saint Barbara. The tower dates from the 13th century.

It is the work of the \\"Suessula Painter\\", an Athenian vase-painter whose name is unknown. He worked in both Corinth and Athens and is recognizable by his style, with great freedom of posture and a unique shading of figures. This red-figure amphora was made around 410-400 BCE and is 69.5 cm tall, 32 cm large. It is currently conserved in the Louvre Museum.  The Gigantomachy  This vase is separated in registers, with the largest register being the only one decorated with mythological scenes one encircling the belly of the amphora is the only one decorated with mythological scenes, the one below is empty and the one above is simply covered in floral motives. The interesting thing about this vase is the difference between the side A and B. Both are a representation of the Gigantomachy, the fight between the Giants, Ga√Øa's sons and the Olympian gods, accompanied by Herakles. The first side is much more elaborated than the second one, and it led specialists to believe that it might be a reproduction of the Gigantomachy of Phidias depicted inside the shield of the Parthenon Athena.\\"L'Amphore de la Gigantomachie de Milo au Mus√©e du Louvre\\" by Pierre Devambez in Comptes rendus des s√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Ann√©e 1963 Volume 107 Num√©ro 3 pp. 282-284 On the side A, we can see Zeus ready to hit a Giant identified as Porphyrion Jane Henle, Greek Myths, A Vase Painter‚Äôs Notebook (Bloomington; Indian University Press, 1973), p. 47. with his lightning bolt, next to Nike on a chariot run by horses, while Dionysus' chariot one is run by panthers. Poseidon is on the same side, on the back of a horse. Athena and Herakles ‚Äì with his leonte, the skin of the lionof Nemea, that he had to kill for his first labor ‚Äì are fighting side by side, under Nike's carriage. Around them, and recognizable by their varying attributes are Apollo, Artemis and Hermes. They all are fighting giants, recognizable by the fact that they are not wearing any kind of clothes. On the side B, which, as it is not as intricate as the side A, and was interpreted as a filling of the other side, a reproduction of the shield, we can see the rest of that Gigantomachy scene, with Ares and Aphrodite on a chair in the middle. Demeter, Persephone, Hekate and the Dioskouroi are also present and fighting the giants. To fully understand the meaning of that vase painting, it is necessary to place it back in its context. It was made by an Athenian artist in the Vth century, at the peak of the Athenian imperialism over the Greek world, afer they both won the Greco-Persian wars and took control of the treasury of the Delian League. During that time, the High Classical Period, representations of Gigantomachy, Centoromachy or amazonomachy were quite common. Those depictions of the Olympian Gods triumphing over lesser, or foreigner societies were used as a metaphor of the Athenian victory over the Persians, and their now supremacy over Greece.\\"On Iconology, Intention, Imagos, and Myths of Meaning\\" by Seymour Howard in Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 17, No. 34 (1996), pp. 83-94 See also * Red-figure pottery * Warfare in ancient Greek art Bibliography * Martine Denoyelle, Chefs d'oeuvre de la c√©ramique grecque dans les collections du Louvre, 1994, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, p. 154, n 72 * Devambez, \\"L'Amazone de l'amphore de la Gigantomachie au Louvre et le bouclier de la Parth√©nos\\", M√©langes Orlandos, 1964, pp. 102-9, pl. 28, 29 Notes Ancient Greek pottery ","title":"Gigantomachy by the Suessula Painter"},{"id":"55270057","text":"The 1984 Girabola was the sixth season of top-tier football competition in Angola.

A round-hooded Portland stone alcove with a figure sitting inside is located at the eastern courtyard of the Colonnade. The alcove was originally part of, and is one of the surviving fragments of the old London Bridge that was demolished in 1831. The alcove was brought to the hospital in 1861, and was re-erected within the eastern internal court in 1926. The alcove now houses the statue of John Keats, an English Romantic poet who studied at Guy's Hospital from 1815 to 1816 to become an apothecary. The statue displayed at the western courtyard on the other side of the Colonnade is that of William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield, another benefactor of Guy's Hospital. The front courtyard, named the General Court, was later built in 1738, and the part of the Georgian complex was completed in 1780. A brass statue of Thomas Guy by Peter Scheemakers stands in the centre of the General Court, upon a pedestal with bas-reliefs of \\"Christ Healing the Sick\\" and the \\"Good Samaritan\\".

She began her literary career by winning the Munhakdongne Writer Award in 2005 with her novel Akeottaega nawatda (ÏïÖÏñ¥ÎñºÍ∞Ä ÎÇòÏôîÎã§ A Swarm of Crocodiles Came Out). In 2009, she won the Jaeum & Moeum Literature Prize for her novel Ozeuwa dakteo (Ïò§Ï¶àÏôÄ Îã•ÌÑ∞ Oz and the Doctor).  Life  An Boyun studied history in university. It was a major she chose in order to become a history teacher. However, when she entered university, it didn't fit with her, leaving her to wander. At that time, her mother mentioned writer Park Bum-shin, saying that if she doesn't like history, perhaps she should take one of his classes. The class that she took by her mother's suggestion was so enjoyable that she started writing fiction. However, she had grown up too ordinarily to write fiction. One time, writer Park Bum-shin, who had taught her during her 20s, asked her what her dream was, and she answered ‚Äúget into a small company, save up for 3 years, and marry a man after 2 years of dating‚Äù. During a fiction writing class, her first story that she had submitted as an assignment received a harsh criticism that said, \\"you have lived far too comfortably, and have resided in such comfort, and it seems that you are simply doing average writing without any sense of challenging yourself and doing something new\\". Because of that, she continued writing out of refusing to yield.Youth Writer Special 2, Special Stories Made From Violent Fantasies ‚Äì Writer An Boyun, Channel Yes, accessed July 28th, 2017.  Writing  An's works are full of violent fantasies. She calmly reveals the pathological elements of Korean society. The characters in her fiction are always second class citizens who are unable to belong anywhere, and are always helplessly exposed to violence. In her debut work, Akeottaega nawatda (ÏïÖÏñ¥ÎñºÍ∞Ä ÎÇòÏôîÎã§ A Swarm of Crocodiles Came Out), one of the protagonists, a woman with C-cup breasts, makes into the finals of a model audition, but she gets eliminated due to her legs not being pretty enough. She begins to hate her legs, and she smashes her legs using a wooden bar with rusty nails, which causes her legs to start rotting, and leads to the amputation of her legs.

At the playground, high school boys order a middle school boy Hwang Sun-gu to rape a middle school girl, and watch it happening while laughing. Hwang Sun-gu discovers an elementary school girl Kwon A-yeong, who is called Shrek because she is ugly and fat, and repeats the violence that he has received on her.Munhakdongne Website , accessed July 28th 2017. As her works are filled with such violence, An has been asked from early in her career why she depicts such unreal violence. However, she instead retorts by asking whether such violence is actually unreal. Because in today's reality, stories that are more fiction than fiction grace the headlines of newspapers everyday, and such brutal and tragic events actually, and certainly exist in this society.Munhakdongne Website , accessed July 28th, 2017. Therefore, in An's works, her protagonists don't have a future. They are in a state where the possibility of being able to change their lives is taken from them, and all they can do is simply endure their hopeless lives. An Boyun shows such uncomfortable truth in the form of an ironic theater of cruelty.

It describes the intramolecular substitution of aromatic compounds via aryldiazonium salts as intermediates and is catalyzed by copper. The reaction is a variant of the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. The following reaction scheme shows the Pschorr cyclization for the example of phenanthrene: Pschorr- Cyclisierung  Reaction mechanism  In the course of the Pschorr cyclization, a diazotization of the starting compound occurs, so that an aryldiazonium salt is formed as intermediate. For this, sodium nitrite is added to hydrochloric acid to obtain nitrous acid. The nitrous acid is protonated and reacts with another equivalent of nitrous acid to the intermediate 1 which is later used for the diazotization of the aromatic amine: Erster Teil des Reaktionsmechanismus der Pschorr-Cyclisierung The intermediate 1 reacts in the following way with the starting compound: Zweiter Teil des Reaktionsmechanismus der Pschorr-Cyclisierung Intermediate 1 replaces a hydrogen atom from the amino group of the starting compound. A nitroso group is introduced as new substituent, producing under the release of nitrous acid intermediate 2. Intermediate 2 then reacts via a tautomerism and dehydration to the aryldiazonium cation 3. Dritter Teil des Reaktionsmechanismus der Pschorr-Cyclisierung Nitrogen is then cleaved from the aryldiazonium cation 3 by the use of the copper catalyst. The aryl radical thus formed reacts via ring closure to the intermediate stage 4. Finally, rearomatization takes place using again the copper catalyst and phenanthrene is formed.  Atom economy  The Pschorr cyclization has a relatively good atom economy, since essentially only nitrogen is produced as a waste material. For the diazotization, two equivalents of nitrous acid are used, of which one equivalent is being re- formed in the course of the reaction. The copper is used in catalytic amounts only and does therefore not affect the atomic efficiency of the reaction. However, when considering the atom economy it has to be mentioned that the Pschorr cyclization has often only low yields.

Early life and army Wynn was the son of Sir John Wynn, 2nd Baronet and his wife Sydney Williams-Wynn, daughter of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 3rd Baronet. He joined the army in 1755 and was a lieutenant in the 13th Foot in 1758. He was captain in the 90th Foot in 1759 and in the Coldstream Guards in 1763, also becoming Lieutenant- Colonel. He was appointed prothonotary and clerk of the Crown for Carnarvonshire Anglesey and Merion in 1762 and held the post until his death. He married Bridget Pugh, daughter. of Edward Philip Pugh of Penrhyn-Creuddyn, Carnarvonshire on 11 January 1766. Political career Wynn stood for Carnarvon on his family interest and was returned as Member of Parliament unopposed in the 1768, 1774 and 1780 general elections. He retired from the army in 1773. In 1781 he was appointed receiver general of land revenue in North Wales and Cheshire. In 1784 he was a member of the St. Alban's Tavern group who tried to bring Fox and Pitt together. However he fell out with Lord Bulkeley who had supported him, and was in financial dispute with his brother Lord Newborough. This dispute related to annuities that their father had left for his children which had not been paid and to Wynn, who took proceedings in Chancery.Gwynnedd Council Rhagorol online catalogue In the 1784 general election Wynn sought the support of Lord Paget who was a great rival of Bulkeley in local politics. He was opposed in the polls by his brother Lord Newborough, who had gained the support of Lord Bulkeley. Wynn was successful after a poll lasting ten days although the contest between the brothers ruined the Wynn interest in Caernarvon. Before the general election of 1790 a compromise was concluded between Lord Bulkeley and Lord Paget (now Lord Uxbridge), and Wynn lost his seat. Later life and legacy Wynn died on 25 June 1793. He and his wife Bridget had four sons and a daughter. The dispute over family inheritance continued until the death of Lor Newborough in 1807, and was then continued against his heirs.

It is a white cylindrical tower with dome and red veins, with illumination being supplied by a red fluorescent light. It was rebuilt in 1954 following a landslide which destroyed the old light and killed ten people on a passing train. History Gibalta Lighthouse, together with the neighbouring lighthouses of Esteiro and Mama, were built to replace older lighthouses, originally built between 1878 and 1879 to guide ships into Lisbon's port. These consisted of a catoptric device with a parabolic reflector and an Argand lamp with two twists. The previous Gibalta light was built in 1914 and, like its predecessor, it used a fixed red light. The lighthouse was 13 metres high and 30 metres above sea level. It was not until 1951 that a flashing light was introduced. View of Gibalta and railway line in 2011 In 1952 there was a landslide of the land on which the lighthouse was built, causing its partial destruction. Known as the Gibalta rail accident the landslide caused the death of ten people on a train from Cascais to Lisbon, the line for which hugged the coastline and passed underneath the lighthouse. On April 3, 1952, what was left of the lighthouse was demolished and a provisional light was mounted. The current building began operation on February 10, 1954, about 30 metres from the former building. It is 21 metres tall and 30 metres above sea level. In 1981 it was automated. From 1987 to 1997 it was only lit from 1 October to 15 March, but from 1997 it has been lit all year round. After its construction a new coastal road, known as the ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù, was built to connect Lisbon with Cascais. To mitigate the effect of the lights from this road, 4 red fluorescent lamps were mounted externally on the tower. In the year 2000, a new Omron remote control system was established.

She grew up on military posts and was educated at a number of different schools. She lived in the Philippines while her father was serving as an advisor to Governor-General Theodore Roosevelt Jr., an experience that fed into two of her earliest two books, Lucio and His Nuong (1939) and That Mario (1941). She served in World War II with the Red Cross, spending five years in New Caledonia, Guadalcanal, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea. Of the nine books she wrote and illustrated, several reflect her life during and after the war. The Magnificent Bastards (1953), her best-known book, was about her experiences with the U.S. Marine Corps, while Popcorn on the Ginza (1949) was about her time in occupied Japan. The Magnificent Bastards was made into a 1956 film starring William Holden and Deborah Kerr under the title The Proud and Profane. Interviewers of Crockett stated that she was \\"mild-looking\\" and seemed, \\"too gentle for the ugliness she described\\" in her books. After the war, she lived in Smyth County, Virginia, where she ran a gift shop. As she got older, she became somewhat paranoid and was placed under house arrest for \\"threatening behavior\\" toward John F. Kennedy. Her papers are held by Virginia Tech.

It has been the only abortion clinic in Mississippi since the only other one closed in 2006. The clinic provides multiple reproductive health services, including abortions, birth control and checkups. As of 2016, the clinic's owner was Diane Derzis. In March 2015, the clinic was severely vandalized, with security cameras destroyed and a generator severely damaged. Legal challenges Many Mississippi Republicans (including the governor, Phil Bryant) have attempted to close JWHO with TRAP laws since 2012, when Bryant signed a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. This was problematic for JWHO, because neither of its two doctors who performed abortions had such privileges. In response to the law, JWHO filed for a restraining order to allow them to remain open temporarily. On Sunday, July 1, 2012, a federal judge granted them this order, preventing the law from being enforced until at least July 11, 2012. In 2013, Derzis told ABC News that both of JWHO's doctors lived out-of-state and flew in every week to work there. In April 2013, Judge Daniel Porter Jordan III issued a ruling blocking part of the law that would have closed JWHO. In 2014, a divided panel of judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision blocking Mississippi from using the law to close JWHO. In a statement accompanying the ruling, Judge E. Grady Jolly wrote that, \\"Mississippi may not shift its obligation to respect the constitutional rights of its citizen to another state\\". In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to review the 2014 decision, thereby allowing it to stand. In March 2017, a U.S. federal court permanently blocked the state of Mississippi from closing JWHO for noncompliance with the law, while still allowing the law to move forward. Additional cases were filed in March 2018 and December 2019. In a 2018 lawsuit, the plaintiffs attempted to assert that there was a specific age at which the abortion would be wrongful. (\\"Gestational Age Act\\") This was later blocked by United States District Judge Carlton W. Reeves.

M. Ellams (born 23 October 1984) is a UK-based poet, playwright and performer.  Biography   Childhood in Nigeria: 1984-1996  Ellams was born in the city of Jos in the north Nigerian highlands to the nation tribe of the nomadic Hausa people in a family with a \\"long line of troublemakers\\". Ellams' father, Inua Ellams I, was born in the early 1950s and grew up Muslim in Bendel State (what is now Delta State) and, while in secondary school, survived through the Midwest Invasion of August 1967 in the Nigerian Civil War, which leveled his town and pitted him against his uncle. He traveled extensively after educating at Nautica University, eventually marrying Ellams' Christian mother in 1995 in a mixed-faith marriage rejected by some wider family members, and found success as a businessman in the import and export trading of Nigerian food. Ellams' family lived a comfortable privileged middle-class Nigerian life with family servants. Ellams attended boarding- school at the Plateau Private School in Jos. Growing up, Ellams wanted to be, variously, an architect, painter (he eventually became disillusioned with due to its perceived pretentiousness), and town planner. He followed both faiths in his household, Islam and Christianity, with \\"similar enthusiasm\\". He played with his sisters' Barbie dolls while composing stories about comic strip superheroes. In 1996, his father went on a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia a tenet of the Islamic faith but he saw some things there which he did not agree with. Upon returning to Nigeria, his father began to openly doubt his faith and was considering to leave Islam and decided to convert to Christianity. Islamic extremists threatened the family and tried to kill his father and burn down their house. One of Ellams' uncles also disappeared in suspicious circumstances. The family escaped to Lagos, but the threats and violence still continued, so in the autumn of 1996, when Ellams was aged 12, the family migrated from Nigeria to London, UK under political exile.  Adolescence in Britain and Ireland: 1996-2002  The family settled in Holland Park, a \\"very multicultural\\" neighborhood of London. British culture was not foreign to him as he had visited London before at age 8 or 9 and loved British television in Nigeria. Unlike in Nigeria, money was tight for his family in Britain, and Ellams even resorted to cutting his own hair being unable to afford to go to the barbershop. He attended Holland Park School in Holland Park, London, where he experienced racism for the first time when, confusingly, a schoolboy called him a \\"nig nog\\". The London law firm they engaged to work on their immigration case was unknowingly fraudulent and the Royal Mail and Home Office had \\"lost\\" the family's immigration papers, which stalled their British immigration case, so in July 1999, at the age of 14, his family was forced to move to Firhouse at the time a poor suburb near Tallaght in the outskirts of Dublin, Ireland. They lived there for three years, and Ellams worked jobs in general office administration for a local architectural firm and a sports retailer in his secondary school years. He attended Firhouse Community College in Firhouse, as the only Black boy at the school in his years. Racism towards him was prevalent, though it was out of ignorance, but he learned to laugh and not give in to self-pity, and eventually found a tightknit group of friends. It is at this school that, at age 17, Ellams worked on his first play: a poor adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, with Dublin slang and a cast of his friends and the school basketball team. He also organized the school's first arts festival and also served as vice-president of the student council. He was deeply affected by the depression-related suicide of his close school friend. Ellams' interest for poetry and basketball was kindled and supported at this school by Mr. Senan Nolan, a poetry teacher and a basketball coach who saw Ellams through the confusion of the racism he was experiencing. He learned about John Keats and Eminem, simultaneously. After his secondary education, he applied for university in Dublin in the field of graphic design, but his family was forced to leave Dublin. Despite moving from Ireland, he retained aspects of his Irish identity.  Adulthood in Britain  In late 2002, at age 18, Ellams and his family settled back in London, UK. By this time, their London immigration law firm had disappeared after being raided and shut down by the Home Office for fraud. He applied for college and art school in Britain, but having unresolved British citizenship status, Ellams qualified as an overseas student, which came with higher tuition fees. Money being \\"painfully tight\\", he could not afford to go, so he did not pursue further post-secondary education. Dejected, he tried visual art, but because he could not afford paint and other art materials, he turned to poetry, thinking of it as \\"painting pictures with words\\". Now an adult, Ellams started working as a self-employed freelance graphic designer for poets, and rekindled relationships with his previous London childhood friends. Ellams began to frequent bookshops, in particular Borders bookshop on Charing Cross Road, every Friday night to write poetry and read and discuss extensively about X-Men comics with a community of Black poets, including Roger Robinson, Nii Ayikwei Parkes and Jacob Sam-La Rose, who would become his mentors. These experiences contributed to his lifelong interest and \\"encyclopaedic knowledge\\" of Marvel comics, and they were formative in his poetry as Ellams relates that \\"part of my poetry education was through comics and fandom.\\" In March 2007, when Ellams was aged 22, his father suffered a hemorrhagic stroke which left him unable to work. Ellams moved into cash-in- hand poetry performance and selling his books as a way to make a living and help his mother to educate his sisters through university while his father was unable to work. Robinson mentored Ellams for his first solo play, The 14th Tale, produced by Fuel Theatre, which took a chance on Ellams despite him not having a work permit in the UK. Ellams had a gig at a sodden Glastonbury Festival, playing to a sozzled crowd. Ellams attended a Royal garden party at the Buckingham Palace at the invitation of Queen Elizabeth II, with Goldie and Andrew Marr, while under threat of deportation by the Home Office. Despite this, the Home Office refuses to recognize Ellams, or the rest of his family, as British citizens. = The Midnight Run = In London in June 2005, Ellams founded The Midnight Run, an undirected and politically-unaffiliated urban social excursion project where strangers gather to explore a city‚Äôs streets from 6pm to midnight or 6am. The project originated when Ellams and a close friend were waiting one night for a bus after seeing a play at Battersea Arts Centre. The bus did not show up, so they walked the bus route aimlessly for hours discovering London. Further influenced by the 1950s French artistic movement The Situationists and the nomadic traditions of Ellams' Nigerian Hausa tribe, Ellams began inviting members of his poetry newsletter mailing list. Over the years, the sessions have expanded initially from poetry excursions to other arts and activities, ranging from \\"Tai Chi instructors to basketball coaches, to guerrilla gardeners and Greek wrestling enthusiasts, to puppetry, poetry and political speech writing, as well as cookery classes\\". The project is currently international, with sessions in Australia and Italy.  Personal life  Ellams has a twin sister as well as one younger and older sister, to whom he attributes his sense of femininity. His twin sister owns a cake bakery business, and wrestled him in childhood. His younger sister, who is around five years younger than him, also owns a bakery business and, unlike Ellams, was granted British citizenship in October 2018. His older sister, who is around two years older than him, works as a PA for the Transport of London as of July 2019. Until 2018, Ellams' family had only \\"discretionary leave to remain\\" in the UK and had to apply to renew and extend their stay in the UK by formal request to the Home Office every three years at a cost of ¬£900 per person; however in 2018, 22 years after first immigrating from Nigeria, Ellams' family was given \\"indefinite leave to remain\\" in the UK. Except for his younger sister, Ellams and his family have not yet been granted British citizenship as of September 2020, and Ellams' application for citizenship was refused in December 2019. Ellams disdains Donald Trump, who figures in some of his poems, though he would like to move to New York City, US. Ellams is gluten-intolerant. Ellams is fascinated with hip hop culture and basketball, which figures occasionally in his work like The Half God of Rainfall. He started playing basketball at age 12 to get the attention of a girl obsessed with African-American culture during his time in Holland Park School. He still plays basketball pick-up games two times a week as point guard. Ellams has written for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Royal National Theatre and the BBC. In June 2018, Ellams was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature as part of its 40 Under 40 initiative.

The play was produced by the National Theatre, Fuel Theatre and Leeds Playhouse and was shortlisted for the Alfred Fagon Award in 2017. Following a period of touring, the play was also performed at the Roundhouse in 2019, and a recording of the National Theatre production was streamed in May 2020 as part of the National Theatre at Home season. For the production, Ellams recorded 60 hours of \\"male banter\\" in barbershops all over Africa and in London at his barber Peter's shop Emmanuel's in Clapham Junction. This project originally did not secure funding. = The Half God of Rainfall = In April 2019 his new play, The Half God of Rainfall, was presented at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, in advance of its run at London's Kiln Theatre, as well as its publication as a book. = Three Sisters = In December 2019‚ÄìFebruary 2020 Ellams's reworking of Chekhov's play Three Sisters was performed at the Royal National Theatre, London.

After the death of her father, her family lived briefly in New Hampshire before moving to Salem, Massachusetts. Tannatt taught for a time in the local public schools. Tannatt published her first written work at the age of ten. Much of her early work was published under the pseudonym \\"Kate True.\\" Career Writing Cover of Across the Continent from Cape Cod to the Golden Gate by Kate Tannatt Woods, 1897 To help support her family, Tannatt Woods published children's books, novels, travelogues, poems, short stories, and nonfiction articles.

Women's club activities In 1891, while living in Salem, she founded the Thought and Work Club and was elected its first president. The club's purpose was to encourage women \\"in all departments of literary work, to promote home study, and to secure literary and social advantages for its members.\\" The club met twice a month at a tearoom on Lynde Street. In addition to literary activities, the club organized civics classes, which were addressed by city officials and state senators, and foreign-language classes. At its peak the club had over 300 members. Its motto was \\"Lofty thoughts and kindly deeds,\\" and its emblem was a pansy, a symbol of thought. The women worked to improve local schoolrooms, clean the streetcars, and elect women to the school board. They successfully campaigned for a half-holiday for store clerks, and published a book of proverbs. Honorary members included Mary Livermore and Laura Ormiston Chant. Tannatt Woods was also an officer of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and a member of the New England Women's Club, the New England Woman's Press Association, the Unity Art Club of Boston, the Wintergreen Club, the Authors' Society of London, and the Moral Education Association of Boston. She was involved in the founding of the Salem Moral Education Association, later renamed the Woman's Friend Society, an organization which provided an employment bureau, a reading room, and a home for young women. In 1893, when the Swami Vivekananda traveled to the United States to attend the Parliament of the World's Religions, Tannatt Woods hosted him in her home on North Street, Salem, which she called \\"Maple Rest.\\" Once her children were grown, she frequently gave readings from her own work and lectures on historical subjects. Personal life and legacy She married attorney George H. Woods of Minnesota, and moved with him to Minneapolis, where she had her first child and published some of her best-received poems and short stories. During the Civil War, her husband served as a first lieutenant in the First Minnesota Regiment under General Sherman. Tannatt joined him at the front, bringing her two small children with her, and volunteered as a nurse. Her husband was seriously injured in battle, leaving him partially disabled. In addition to raising two children, Tannatt Woods cared for her husband's elderly parents. After her husband's death, she resettled in Salem. She died in Buffalo, New York, on July 12, 1910, at the home of her son Prince. She is remembered in connection with the Thought and Work Club on the Salem Women's Heritage Trail.

Creating abstract works since 2011, he painted figuratively for most of his career, particularly large triptychs.  Biography  Jessup was born on July 18, 1952 in Moscow, Idaho to Clifford and Alvina Jessup and was raised in Seattle, Washington. He received his BFA in painting from the University of Washington in 1975 and his MFA in painting from the University of Iowa in 1979. He has had professorships at Ohio State University, Georgia State University, Cornell University, the Hartford Art School and the University of North Texas. He is currently the Professor of Drawing and Painting in the College of Visual Arts and Design at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas.  Works   Figurative (1971 - 2004)  Although Jessup occasionally created in other styles this period is predominantly stylized and representational. The paintings tended to be large triptychs roughly 15 feet wide by 6 feet tall. The entire surface of each painting tended to be heavily textured like a choppy sea when viewed up close. The subject matter appeared heavily symbolic.  Transitional (2005 - 2010)  Already an established artist Jessup, then in his mid-fifties, and his wife Faith travelled to Europe for a month in 2008. They travelled to Madrid, Brussels and Florence but it was the baroque paintings in the Prado in Spain that influenced him the most. He returned ‚Äúwith a desire to be more aggressive, more ambitious, more visionary, and take more chances.‚Äù Paintings during this time were strange and sometimes unsettling.  Abstract (2011 - present)  Jessup ‚Äúexchanged ferocious depiction for ferocious plasticity‚Äù and started painting completely in the abstract style. He started working ‚Äúwith a 10-inch palette knife, making huge sweeping gestures, pushing the paint this way and that, scraping it off and hurling it back on.‚Äù  Selected Exhibitions  * The Amarillo Museum of Art, Amarillo, TXhttp://amarillo.com/stories/060103/fea_artbeat.shtml * Besharat Gallery, Atlanta, GAhttp://atlanta.besharatgallery.com/artists/robert-jessup/ * Conduit Gallery, Dallas, TXhttp://conduitgallery.com/artists/robert-jessup * Fay Gold Gallery, Atlanta, GAhttp://www.faygoldgallery.com/exhibition-schedule/ * Schomburg Gallery, Santa Monica, CAhttp://www.schomburggallery.com/exhibitions.htm * Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, VAhttps://www.vmfa.museum/library/wp- content/uploads/sites/16/2013/12/ExhibitionHistory.1936-2009.pdf  Personal life  Jessup is married to the painter Faith Scott Jessup whom he met while both were at Cornell.

At one extreme, the parent H2PNH2 is lightly studied and fragile, but at the other extreme tris(dimethylamino)phosphine (P(NMe2)3) is commonly available. Intermediate members are known, such as Ph2PN(H)Ph. These compounds are typically colorless and reactive toward oxygen. They have pyramidal geometry at phosphorus. Parent members P(NMe2)3. The aminophosphine called the Verkade base is a superbase. The fundamental aminophosphines have the formulae PH2‚àín(NH2)n (n = 1, 2, 3). These species cannot be isolated in a practical quantities, although they have been examined theoretically. H2NPH2 is predicted to be more stable than the P(V) tautomer HN=PH3.

Ateizm Derneƒüi is headquartered in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Istanbul. As of 2019, its president is Selin √ñzkohen.  History  Among Nonbelievers trailer, featuring Ateizm Derneƒüi. At the time of the foundation, the organisation was headed by a board consisting of eleven members, presided by Tolga ƒ∞nci. It is the first legally recognised Turkish atheist organisation, and simultaneously one of the first in the Muslim-majority world. The direct cause to form the organisation was a remark made by president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, who has stimulated tendencies to Islamise Turkey, and said \\"(...) despite the [protests of] leftists, despite those atheists. They are terrorists\\", referring to his enforcement of construction plans, despite student protests in Ankara. The foundation of the association has bureaucratically run smoothly, but the association has installed surveillance cameras because of harassment and threats, telephone recording devices and a panic button for faster reaching the police. In 2015, Ateizm Derneƒüi was featured in Doroth√©e Forma's Dutch documentary film Among Nonbelievers, where several of its members were interviewed by former Dutch Member of Parliament and Dutch Humanist Association president Boris van der Ham. In 2018 it was reported in some media outlets that the Ateizm Derneƒüi would close down because of the pressure on its members and attacks by pro- government media, but the association itself issued a clarification that this was not the case and that it was still active.  Recognition and awards  Ateizm Derneƒüi was recognised by the European Union as the representative organisation of Turkish atheists in June 2014. In 2017, the association won the International League of non-religious and atheists's Sapio Award for being the first organisation in the Middle East defending the rights of atheists.

A minor stakes winner at age three, he won his first Grade I race at age four in the United Nations Stakes. At age five, he won five of six starts including the Grade I Fourstardave Handicap and Woodbine Mile before his victory at the Breeders' Cup. Background World Approval was bred in Florida by Live Oak Stud, which is owned by Charlotte Weber, the granddaughter of Campbell Soup founder John T. Dorrance. World Approval raced as a homebred for Weber's Live Oak Plantation. His sire is Northern Afleet, best known as the sire of dual classic winner Afleet Alex. World Approval's dam is Win Approval, a daughter of Canadian Triple Crown champion With Approval. Win Approval previously produced Breeders' Cup Mile winner Miesque's Approval and multiple stakes winners Za Approval and Revved Up. World Approval was originally trained by Christophe Clement, but after two unsuccessful starts was transferred to the barn of Mark Casse. Casse has won numerous Sovereign Awards as the outstanding trainer in Canada. World Approval is an attractive gray gelding, known around the backstretch for his difficult temperament. \\"He lures you in a little bit with his beauty and then it's like he strikes at any time\\", said Casse. Racing career World Approval made two starts at age two, finishing fourth on October 16, 2014 at Belmont Park and third on November 26 at Aqueduct, both races over the main (dirt) track. He made his three-year-old debut on the turf March 14, 2015 at Gulfstream Park, winning the race with a late outside run by lengths. In his stakes debut on April 4, he won the Sophomore Turf Stakes at Tampa Bay Downs. After two losses, he was shipped to Arlington Park where he won his first graded stakes, the American Derby. His next start came at saratoga Race Course in the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame Stakes where he finished fourth, but then took the Saranac Stakes in his next start, also at Saratoga. He closed his three year-old season with a fourth place finish in the Hill Prince Stakes. 2016: four-year-old campaign At age four, World Approval won only twice in eight starts but was consistently in the money in top level stakes company. He started the year on March 5, 2016 in an allowance optional claiming race, where he set the early pace and then drew away in the stretch to win by lengths. He then finished second in the Muniz Memorial Handicap after racing near the back of the field in the early running and then being floated wide in the final turn. He made his first start in Grade I company in the Turf Classic Stakes on May 7, losing by a neck to Divisidero after a determined closing drive. In the Manhattan Stakes on June 11, he set the early pace but was caught in the stretch by Flintshire and Ironicus to finish third. On July 3, World Approval was entered in the Grade I United Nations Stakes at Monmouth Park, where he went off as the 2.7-1 second choice behind Man o' War Stakes winner Wake Forest. In his first start at miles, he received a \\"perfect trip\\" while rating behind the early pacesetter Cement Clement, then took command of the race entering the stretch. Despite a late run from Money Multiplier, he held on to win by lengths. \\"The only question was whether he could go that far,\\" said jockey Florent Geroux. \\"But he showed he can do it and he did it well. When I asked him at the quarter pole, he responded nicely.\\" In the Arlington Million on August 13, World Approval was in contention until late in the race, when he weakened to finish seventh in a blanket finish. He then entered the Northern Dancer Stakes where he set a slow pace and led for much of the race but was outkicked near the finish line to finish third. \\"It's hard to believe the pace was that slow,\\" Casse said. \\"They certainly sprinted home. I'm not sure that's exactly how he wants to run but I understand that [jockey Julien Leparoux] had no other choice.\\" World Approval finished his four-year-old season on October 16 in the Canadian International at a distance of miles. He led for most of the race but tired in the stretch to finish eighth. 2017: five-year-old campaign World Approval made his five-year-old debut on April 2 in the EG Vodka Turf Classic, a stakes race for Florida-bred horses run at a distance of miles. After rating behind the early leader Go Around, he pulled away in deep stretch to win by lengths. He was scheduled to make his next start in the Turf Classic Stakes at Churchill Downs but was scratched due to soft going. Instead he was entered in the Grade II Dixie Stakes on May 20 at Pimlico Race Course, where he went off as the 5-2 favorite on a turf course rated as good. Benefiting from a perfect trip, he again stalked the early pace before drawing away at the top of the stretch to win by lengths. On June 10, World Approval was entered in the Grade I Manhattan Handicap at a distance of miles over Belmont Park's inner turf course. The race attracted multiple stakes winners from the United States and Europe but was won by long-shot Ascend, who won easily in his graded stakes debut. World Approval finished fifth after being outkicked in a blanket finish for second place. Casse later stated that the race was an eye-opener in that the distance of the race was simply too long for the horse against top quality opposition. Accordingly, his next start was at a distance of only one mile in the Fourstardave Handicap at Saratoga on August 12. Some late rain softened up the turf course but Casse felt the horse had run so well in the Dixie Stakes that it wouldn't be a problem. Casse told jockey Manny Franco that the horse liked to run at a target, so Franco settled behind the early leaders for the first six furlongs. Turning into the stretch, he swung World Approval four-wide and the horse responded with a convincing length win. \\"I just tried to stay out of trouble,\\" said Franco, who earned his first Grade I win at Saratoga. \\"I sensed the pace was good enough because they were fighting for the lead on the first turn.\\" World Approval followed up with another Grade I win in the Woodbine Mile on September 16 as the 2-1 favorite. He was ridden for the first time by John Velazquez, who quickly realized that no one was interested in setting a decent pace. Accordingly, he went to the early lead and was soon joined by Dragon Bay. Velazquez gave World Approval his head and the horse relaxed as they raced down the backstretch. When Velazquez finally asked him to run, World Approval responded by running the final quarter mile in 22.74 seconds to win by lengths. \\"I wasn't sure how he would quicken with not having the target,\\" said Casse, who had watched the race from Lexington. \\"But there wasn't a whole lot of speed and Johnny realized that and rode him accordingly.\\" On November 4, World Approval entered the Breeders' Cup Mile at Del Mar, going off as the slight 5-2 favorite on a day dominated by longshot winners. The field of fourteen also included a strong European contingent featuring Ribchester (Lockinge Stakes, Queen Anne, Prix du Moulin de Longchamp), Roly Poly (Falmouth Stakes, Prix Rothschild, Sun Chariot), Suedois (Shadwell Turf Mile), Lancaster Bomber and Zelzal, plus several American-based stakes winners like Blackjackcat and Midnight Storm. World Approval stalked the early pace set by Midnight Storm and Heart to Heart, then swung wide to get racing room as the field turned into the stretch. He wore down the tiring front runners and drew off to win by lengths, with Lancaster Bomber prevailing in a blanket finish for second place. World Approval raced three times in 2018, winning the Grade III Tampa Bay Stakes while unplaced in his other two starts. Retirement World Approval was officially retired on February 26, 2019. He will be pastured next to his dam and stakes-winning siblings Za Approval and Revved Up. Charlotte Weber commented on her pride in the achievement of the family. \\"I am proud and privileged to have experienced this Sport of Kings with such outstanding racehorses,\\" she said, \\"and shall protect them as we grow older together.\\" Honors and assessment World Approval was voted American Champion Male Turf Horse for 2017 and was finalist for Horse of the Year. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, World Approval was rated the twelfth-best horse in the world, and the best turf horse in the United States.

She then returned to Paris to earn a living as an employee in a store. She attended meetings led Ren√© Viviani et Albert Thomas. She became a socialist activist in 1899. From that time on, she campaigned for absolute equality between men and women, which, according to her, would only be possible with the transformation of economic structures and the implementation of socialism. She joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905. She was widowed in the First World War, and raised her child alone. She remarried on March 23, 1926, with the union leader Georges Buisson, who in 1929 became the adjunct secretary of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). She took on a major role in the SFIO after the war. She became responsible for the column \\"Woman, Activist\\" (\\"La femme, la militante\\") in Le Populaire, a French socialist newspaper, and Secretary of the National Committee of Socialist Women. In 1924 she was elected to the Executive Committee of the party, a post which she would occupy until 1932, then again from 1935 to 1936. In 1933‚Äì1934 and 1938‚Äì1939, she was a member of the Permanent Administrative Committee, the principal decision-making organism of the SFIO at the time. She was first made a member by a motion presented by Vincent Auriol, the second by a motion of L√©on Blum. In 1931, she was a part of the SFIO delegation to the Socialist International Congress, held in Vienna.  French Resistance  Since 1938, Suzanne Buisson aligned herself with partisans united in opposition to Hitler. In March 1941, she cofounded the Socialist Action Committee (CAS) and became its treasurer. She made numerous forays around the country to distribute Resistance literature and participate in actions supporting the Socialist activists arrested by the Vichy regime or German authorities. In March 1943, when the CAS effectively became a reunited, clandestine SFIO, Suzanne Buisson became a member of its political bureau. Two months later, she became responsible for relations with the Communist Party.  Sacrifice  Soon after, the Gestapo discovered the headquarters of the clandestine SFIO. Informed of their raid, Suzanne Buisson paced through the building, alerting her comrades, when she was arrested by the Gestapo. Under pains of torture she revealed nothing to the Germans. Being Jewish as well as a r√©sistante, she was deported, and ultimately died at Auschwitz. L√©on Blum paid her homage in the edition of February 2, 1946 of Le Populaire \\"She was the accomplished, exemplary activist of whom the party could ask anything, who never shirked her duties, but on the contrary, could be relied upon to fulfill them with absolute devotion and disinterest. In the everyday workings of the party, she hesitated before no task; in clandestine struggle she recoiled before no danger.\\"  Sources  * Jean-Marc Binot, Denis Lefebvre et Pierre Serne, 100 ans, 100 socialistes, √©d.

It is often referred to as being any heat treatment performed after welding; however, within the oil, gas, petrochemical and nuclear industries, it has a specific meaning. Industry codes, such as the ASME Pressure Vessel and Piping Codes, often require mandatory performance of PWHT on certain materials to ensure a safe design with optimal mechanical and metallurgical properties. The need for PWHT is mostly due to the residual stresses and micro-structural changes that occur after welding has been completed. During the welding process, a high temperature gradient is experienced between the weld metal and the parent material. As the weld cools, residual stress is formed. For thicker materials, these stresses can reach an unacceptable level and exceed design stresses. Therefore, the part is heated to a specified temperature for a given amount of time to reduce these stresses to an acceptable level. In addition to residual stresses, microstructural changes occur due to the high temperatures induced by the welding process. These changes can increase hardness of the material and reduce toughness and ductility. The use of PWHT can help reduce any increased hardness levels and improve toughness and ductility to levels acceptable for design. The requirements specified within various pressure vessels and piping codes are mostly due to the chemical makeup and thickness of the material. Codes such as ASME Section VIII and ASME B31.3 will require that a specified material be post weld heat treated if it is over a given thickness. Codes also require PWHT based solely on the micro-structural make-up of the material. A final consideration in deciding the need for PWHT is based on the components' intended service, such as one with a susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking. In such cases, PWHT is mandatory regardless of thickness.  Application  Rate of heating, hold times and temperatures, and rate of cooling are all important variables that need to be controlled and monitored precisely, or the desired effects may not be achieved. When PWHT is mandatory by a given industry code, requirements for these variables will be specified.  Heating  The rate of heating when PWHT is performed is typically based on the component‚Äôs thickness and is specified by the governing codes. If the rate of heating is not performed properly, either by heating too quickly or unevenly, temperature gradients within the component can become detrimental to the component. As a result, stress cracks may occur and residual stresses not previously created can form when the component is cooled to ambient temperatures.  Holding temperature and time  Holding temperature and time are governed by the material and thickness respectively. Regarding material thickness, longer holding times are needed for thicker materials. This is to allow the material to reach a stable condition where the distribution and levels of stresses become more uniform and decrease. The specified holding temperature is one that is at a high enough temperature to relieve high residual stress levels, yet is still below the lower transformation temperature. In addition to the reduction of stress, high hold temperatures below the transformation temperature allow for microstructural transformations, therein reducing hardness and improving ductility. Great care should be taken as to not heat the component above the lower transformation temperature, as detrimental metallurgical effects and impaired mechanical properties can result. In addition, the holding temperature should not be greater than the original tempering temperature unless later mechanical testing is performed. Holding above the original tempering temperature can reduce the strength of the material to below ASME required minimums.  Cooling  As with the heating rate, the cooling rate must be controlled, as to avoid any detrimental temperature gradients that could cause cracking or introduce new stresses during cooling. In addition to this, rapid cooling rates can increase hardness, which may increase the susceptibility of a brittle fracture. .  Monitoring technique  Thermocouples are typically attached to the component undergoing PWHT to check and ensure that heating rates, hold temperatures, and cooling rates meet code specification. Computer software is typically used in conjunction with the thermocouples to monitor the fore-mentioned variables and provide documentation that the PWHT was performed properly.

The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau was formed in 1968 to copy archives, manuscripts and rare printed material relating to the Pacific Islands. The aim of the Bureau is to help with long-term preservation of the documentary heritage of the Pacific Islands and to make it accessible.  History   Background  Pacific scholar Harry E. Maude, Department of Pacific History at the Australian National University from 1958, was the first to conceptualise the workings of the Bureau when he discussed the need for interlibrary co- operation in the copying of documents of Pacific interest for Pacific researchers with Dr Floyd Cammack, University of Hawaii in December 1962. Dr Cammack proposed an association of Pacific research libraries and contacted potential members, winning support from Gordon Richardson, Mitchell Librarian and Principal Librarian of the NSW Public Library. In 1966 Richardson pursued the idea of a joint copying scheme and with the University of Hawaii requested Maude produce a paper to make the scheme a reality. Maude's Paper entitled: The Documentary Basis for Pacific Studies: a Report on Progress and Desiderata, was released in March 1967. It proposed setting up a Pacific Islands Manuscripts Clearing Centre to identify and obtain microfilm copies of unpublished documents on the Pacific Islands.  Establishment  Maude's Paper recommended the proposed Pacific Islands Manuscripts Clearing Centre be established at the Australian National University (ANU), the only institution in the world at that time with a Department of Pacific History. The Australian National University supported Maude's proposal and invited the National Library of Australia, National Library of New Zealand, the Mitchell Library (State Library of New South Wales), and the University of Hawaii to sponsor and establish the Centre effective 1 January 1968. The Pacific Islands Manuscripts Clearing Centre was declared fully operational under the name Pacific Manuscripts Bureau on 1 July 1968 with Robert Langdon, then editor of the Pacific Islands Monthly, appointed to manage the Bureau.  Objectives  The aim of the Bureau is to help with long-term preservation of the documentary heritage of the Pacific Islands and to make it accessible.  Pacific Islands Archives  To this end the Bureau undertakes fieldwork in the Pacific Islands to copy archives, manuscripts and rare printed material, particularly when the material is in danger of loss or destruction. Island based records have been identified as most at risk due to climatic factors and lack of trained staff to care for them. Fieldwork reports can be found on the Bureau's website.  International Pacific Island Collections  The Bureau has an interest in copying archives relating to the Pacific in major collections throughout the world, including member libraries. An earlier co- operative microfilming project, The Australian Joint Copying Project, achieved some success. In its 45-year history it microfilmed a large number of Pacific manuscripts in the United Kingdom, many identified by Mitchell Librarian, Phyllis Mander-Jones during the 1960s.  Membership  The Bureau is based at the Australian National University in the College of Asia and the Pacific and is sponsored by an international consortium of Pacific research libraries. Each member Library has the complete PMB Collection. The Libraries are: * Mitchell Library, State Library of NSW, Sydney * National Library of Australia, Canberra * The Library, Australian National University, Canberra * Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington * University of Auckland Library * Hocken Library, University of Otago, Dunedin * Library of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu * Library of the University of California, San Diego * Yale University Library, New Haven * University of Michigan Library, Ann Arbor * University of Bergen Library, Bergen * University of the South Pacific * National University of Samoa, Apia  Collections   Content  The Pacific Manuscripts Bureau collection is the most extensive collection of non- government primary documentation on the Pacific Islands available to researchers.

Context With the death of Joseph Smith on June 27, 1844, the First Presidency of the LDS Church was dissolved. The leadership of the Church was taken on by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles with Brigham Young, the president of the quorum, taking on the main leadership role. By 1845 it became apparent to the church leaders in Nauvoo, Illinois that the violence against the members of the Church would not abate. Consequently, they began to make plans to evacuate Nauvoo and migrate to the Rocky Mountains where they hoped to establish Church headquarters and practice their religion in relative isolation and peace. Originally they planned to leave Nauvoo in April 1846. Ongoing concerns about their safety and their ability to leave Nauvoo led the Church leaders on February 2, 1846 to meet to discuss their situation. Two days later on February 4, 1846, a large group left the town. The journey across southern Iowa was difficult due to inclement weather and incessantly muddy roads. The journey took the better part of three and half months and left the members of the Church bereft of provisions, fatigued, and sickly. They settled in the territory of the Omaha Tribe on the west bank of the Missouri River as well the east bank of the river in Council Bluffs. They called the area Kanesville in honor Thomas L. Kane, an attorney, friend and advocate for the Latter-day Saints. Kane helped the Church leaders negotiate an agreement that allowed them to establish a provisioning base in the territory of the Omaha tribe known as Winter Quarters. In the Spring of 1847, Young led the first group of Mormon Pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley, arriving in the valley on July 24, 1847. Many of the pioneers stayed in the Salt Lake Valley, planting crops, preparing homes, and starting the settlement that would grow into Salt Lake City. Young, however, quickly returned to Winter Quarters (near present-day Florence, Nebraska) to organize the remainder of the pioneers in preparation for their trek and to deal with a few business items. Construction One of the items of business that Young wanted to accomplish was the reorganization of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Since Joseph Smith's death, the First Presidency had not existed, and Young believed it was finally time to reorganize it. In anticipation of the event, the LDS Church leaders felt it necessary and appropriate to construct a hall large enough to accommodate the large number of Latter-Day Saints who would want to witness the event. With this end in mind, approximately 200 Mormon Pioneers spent two and a half weeks building the large log-cabin like hall. The dimensions of the building were 40 feet by 60 feet with a large sod-block fireplace and chimney located at one end. In the center of the wall opposite the entrance, there was a small wing that provided a stage upon which the church leaders could sit and conduct the meeting. It was here on December 27, 1847 with 1,000 people in attendance that Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards were sustained by members of the Church as the new First Presidency, and Brigham Young was sustained as the second president of the Church. Destruction Another important event that took place in this building was the reconciliation of Oliver Cowdery, who had been excommunicated in Missouri in 1838, with the leadership of the Church. Shortly after the building's construction, it became apparent that it had been built over the top of a spring and the base of the building was rotting. Having served its purpose the building was torn down two years after its completion. Reconstruction The Kanesville Tabernacle was reconstructed in the mid-1990s as a replica of the original building. The reconstruction was not directed or financed by the LDS Church, but rather by the Pottawattamie County Mormon Trails Association and Kanesville Restoration, Inc. Major financial backers for the replica of the tabernacle were Bill and Patricia Ann Child and Mont and Viola Nelson. Bob Schulze directed the building program. The replica, which sits less than a block from the site of the original tabernacle, was dedicated by Church President Gordon B. Hinckley on July 13, 1996. In 1999, the tabernacle was donated to the Church and now serves as an official visitors' center. Like the original tabernacle, the replica was built from cottonwood. The wood shrank two inches in the first two months and was anticipated to shrink another ten inches over the first five years of its life. To counteract this, the church placed jacks under the main supports that can be lowered as the walls shrink.

Geologic history Maine's geologic past is unknown prior to 650 million years ago, although some geologists have suggested that rocks over a billion years old may be present in units of the Chain Lakes in northwestern Maine. The state is made up of three distinct terranes, including Laurentia, Iapetus Ocean terranes and the former microcontinent of Avalonia. With the breakup of the supercontinent Pannotia beginning 600 million years ago, the new continent of Laurentia‚ÄîProto-North America‚Äîbegan shedding eroded material out into the newly formed Iapetus Ocean. The region experienced limestone and marine sediment deposition, in connection with the erosion of a neighboring microcontinent. The region that is now northern Penobscot Bay, which then belonged to the microcontinent Avalonia, experienced an episode of pegmatite intrusion and metamorphism around 650 million years ago. Throughout the early Paleozoic, from the Cambrian into the early Ordovician, Laurentia experienced limestone and shale deposition at its continental margin from a position near the equator. On the Iapetus terranes, a mix of sediment deposition and volcanism took place during the early Cambrian, after which a proposed microplate collision launched the Penobscottian mountain building event. This period of metamorphism and deformation is preserved in rocks in northwest and north-central Maine. The early Ordovician marked a return to sedimentation and volcanism on the Iapetus terranes. Simultaneously, while Avalonia was situated in the Southern Hemisphere, it experienced much less limestone formation, although it also experienced sedimentation and volcanism throughout the Cambrian that is now preserved in rocks near Penobscot Bay. Beginning in the middle Ordovician, the offshore Iapetus terranes collided with Laurentia, launching the Taconic Orogeny mountain building event, which included uplift, deformation and igneous activity. Portions of the island arcs of the Iapetus terranes are preserved in the Boundary Mountains. Avalonia continued to experience sedimentation and volcanism and the intrusion of granite bodies in the Silurian, now found along the central coast of Maine. Avalonia and Laurentia collided in the early Devonian. The collision started the Acadian orogeny, a major mountain building event. As a result of the collision, sediments in what is today northern Maine were buried to a depth of nine miles and underwent metamorphism. The collision also brought about the formation of the northern Appalachian Mountains, numerous faults and widespread igneous activity. At the time the new composite continent was positioned south of the equator. During the Carboniferous the intrusion of Sebago granite took place. Slight remnants of sandstone and other sedimentary rocks deposited during this period remain along the coast of Maine. The Carboniferous marked the end of regional deformation and metamorphism. During the Permian, North America shifted north of the equator white Maine experienced uplift and erosion, exposing deeper rocks. The breakup of Pangaea during the early Mesozoic was marked with new faulting of bedrock in Maine and the intrusion of basalt dikes on southwest coast of Maine. Limited igneous activity continued into the late Mesozoic. During the Cenozoic, uplift and erosion continued in the northern Appalachians. Maine became extensively glaciated during the Pleistocene. Extensive erosion altered much of the region's surface while the ice weighted down the continental crust. The release of stress and the slow rebound of the land surface since the end of the Pleistocene has generated new uplift, fractures and erosion. Humans arrived in Maine beginning in the early Holocene and human activity has played an increasing role in the surficial geology of the region since the start of European colonization and statehood. Physical geography The northeast coast of Maine belongs to the Coastal Volcanic Belt, which extends into New Brunswick, while most of the state lies in the Central Maine Basin up to the Boundary Mountains in north-central Maine. North of the mountains the Connecticut Valley Basin stretches from Vermont into Quebec. Bedrock geology A belt of Ordovician-Silurian rocks extends from Kittery to northeast of Bangor, with sandstone and slate in the east and gneiss and schist in the southwest. From southwest of Augusta to just south of Houlton, extending to the Canadian border are Silurian rocks, also found in a small area near Machias along the coast and in smaller areas further north. The Silurian rocks trend from marine shale in the north to gneiss and schist in the south west. A large area of the state, in a narrow belt from the New Hampshire line widening around Greenville and Millinocket and extending across much of northern Maine to Fort Kent is Devonian rock, including shale and sandstone in the north and gneiss and schist in the southwest. Northwest York County is Silurian-Devonian bedrock, with marine slate sandstone and slate in the east, grading to schist closer to New Hampshire. A small area of igneous syenite intrusions is also found in York County on the coast, northeast of Kittery. Parts of Oxford, Penobscot, Hancock, Piscataquis and other counties have Devonian age gabbro, slate, granite and granodiorite. Very small pockets of unmetamorphosed conglomerate and sandstone dating to the Devonian and Carboniferous are found slightly to the west of Presque Isle and northwest of Eastport. Franklin and western Somerset County contain Precambrian and Ordovician gneiss, breccia, limestone, marble, sandstone, slate, syenite and diorite. Mt. Desert Island, Calais and portions of Downeast Maine and the Mid- Coast are Silurian granite and gabbro. Among metamorphosed rocks, central and northern Maine display decreasing levels of metamorphism further north. A belt of highly metamorphosed rocks extends from just of north of Casco Bay through Androscoggin and Oxford counties. Surficial geology and soils Soils are a part of the surficial geology of Maine, but are often considered and studied separately because of their role in construction and agriculture. Maine soils have formed since the retreat of the last ice sheet from the region 12,500 years before the present. Much of Oxford County and parts of Cumberland, York and Androscoggin County have loam soils, derived from granite, gneiss and schist with an average depth to bedrock of 5 feet, underlain by sandy till with a groundwater 30 inches below the surface in winter. Riverbeds in central and northeast Maine are lined with sandy glacial outwash made up of gneiss, limestone, phyllite, shale and granite. Much of coastal Maine has clay-loam soils from marine and lake sediments, with a water table at the surface or 12 inches below it and poor drainage throughout the year. Much of northern Maine has poorly drained loam soils, basal till, with material derived from schist, phyllite slate and metastone. Similar soils are found across an additional 23% of Maine. Surface stones and boulders are common throughout most of Maine. Much of greater Portland, greater Augusta and coastal and river channels of southwest Maine feature clay-loam soils or sandy soils, with very few boulders and surface rocks. Hydrogeology and water resources The hydrogeology and water resources of Maine are closely related to the state's surficial geology, soils, climate, land use and environment. The Maine Geological Survey began a continuing process of mapping sand and gravel aquifers beginning in 1978. Statewide, Maine receives an annual rainfall total of 42 inches or 24 trillion gallons. Up to 50% of rainfall runs off the landscape in rivers and streams, while an additional 30‚Äì40% evaporates or is transpired through vegetation. Between 10% and 20% of precipitation (including rain and snow melt) recharges groundwater. Because of the state's rural and small town settlement pattern 40% of residents use private groundwater wells for household water. Maine has extensive sand and gravel aquifers formed in sediments left behind after the last glaciation. Northwestern Maine is currently unmapped for these aquifers. Deeper, bedrock aquifers formed within cracks in the state's igneous and metamorphic basement rock are also present. For drilled wells, the average borehole depth is 250 feet. Groundwater is recharged in the springtime with rain and snow melt, but drops throughout the summer. Saltwater intrusion is a growing problem in heavily populated coastal locations. Mining in Maine In the 21st century, granite quarries and gravel pits continue to contribute to the economy of Maine. However, mining has a long history in the state, stretching back to the early 19th century. The Lubec Lead Mine was an early mine operating in the 1830s. Maine's first State Geologist, Charles T. Jackson, sketched a diagram of the site's limestone, greenstone trap-rock and veins of galena during an 1837 visit. The site is still open for amateur mineral collecting, although the State of Maine advises extreme caution as a result of potential flooding from high tides. In surficial, udic soils, Maine had an extensive bog iron extraction industry in the 1800s, including smelters such as the Katahdin Iron Works, which operated in the 1840s. One of sixteen brick kilns for producing charcoal to smelt the iron remains at the site. Maine experienced a boom in metal mining between 1879 and 1882, centered in Lubec, Acton, Blue Hill and Sullivan. A dedicated publication, the Maine Mining Journal was published starting in 1880. Although the boom was partially an economic bubble, some mines such as the Douglass Copper Mine in Blue Hill produced viable quantities of copper and continued to do so until 1918 under the control of the American Smelting and Mining Company. High silver prices drove a short period of silver mining in Cherryfield between 1905 and 1907, but after 1890 little significant metal mining took place. Manganese ore, discovered in the 1840s, was extracted during World War II in Aroostook County for the US war effort. Harborside Copper Mine in Brooksville first opened in the 1880s, but was acquired and reopened by Callahan Mining Corporation from New York in 1965. The company got permission from the state to drain the Goose Pond tidal inlet and opened an open pit copper mine that operated until reserves were depleted in 1972. The mine was equipped with a flotation mill and shipped zinc to Pennsylvania and copper to Quebec for smelting. A larger zinc, copper and lead mine was operated by Kerramerican next to Second Pond in Blue Hill. State Geologist John S. Cummings discovered a 35 million ton massive copper-zinc sulfide deposit in Aroostook County, estimated to be the third largest find in the US, in September, 1977, but the deposit has not been developed. The deposit stretches across 130 miles, between 50 and 60 miles in northern Maine. Historically, Rockport supported large limestone kilns to supply the East Coast cement industry and North Paris had a feldspar plant until 1988. The Central Maine Slate Belt from Waterville to Brownville was a site of widespread slate mining into the early 20th century. Small scale slate mining continues in Monson and a small clay pit supplies the Morin Brick Company in Auburn. Between the 1940s and 1980s, Maine also had a small peat industry in Penobscot, Sullivan, Deblois, Franklin, Friendship and Centerville. Significant quantities of aggregate are extracted from locations such as the Whitefield and Topsham gravel pits, Blue Rock quarry as well as the large Dragon Cement plant in Thomaston. Deer Isle granite is still quarried in Stonington, 80 years after the Great Depression and the widespread adoption of concrete hobbled the Maine granite industry.

It belonged to Rong Zongjing, a Chinese industrialist and national capitalist during the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China who was known as the \\"King of Flour\\". The house was purchased by Rong Zongjing in 1918 as one of his Shanghai homes.  Description  The house is built in a western-style and is a standalone three story home. Including the garden area the total land space is 6.6 mu, 2,182 square meters of which are taken up by the house and 2,475 square meters for the garden. Rong Zhai was designed in an Eclecticism style with reinforced concrete structure by Chen Chunjiang. The interior was decorated with a combination of French classicism and traditional Chinese elements. The outside structure and technology are mainly Western style while the inside arrangements had more of a traditional Chinese design. History In 1918 Rong Zongjing purchased the house from a German person who had returned home to Germany after World War I, however the house was left empty for a long period of time by his family due to the need to develop the family business. In 1949, after the liberation of Shanghai, the Rong family rented the house to the China Economic Research Institute. The house was also rented to the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch in 2002 for ten years while he used it as his Shanghai office for the News Corporation.

Village site The village of Kiusta lies on a sheltered beach facing Cloak Bay on the northwest corner of Graham Island, opposite Langara Island. It faces north onto Parry Passage, noted for its tidal currents, but is well protected by Marchand Reef along its northern end.ibid History Kiusta is one of the few sites that has been archeologically dated and \\"in 1986, archeologists from the Haida Gwaii Museum uncovered campfire charcoal dating back 10,400 years\\" denoting it as \\"one of the oldest known sites of human activity in British Columbia.\\"Horwood, Dennis, Lesley Cameron, and Karla Decker. Haida Gwaii: the Queen Charlotte Islands. Surrey, BC: Heritage House Pub., 2009. Early European references: contact with Kiusta During the maritime fur trade era Chief Cuneah was the primary leader of Kiusta and had influence over the entire region. George Dixon visited the Kiusta area in 1787 and called the inlet where he traded \\"Cloak Bay\\", for the large number of beautiful sea otter cloaks he acquired there. The first European to visit Kiusta and meet Cuneah was William Douglas, in June 1789. Kiusta was first portrayed in 1799, in a drawing in the journal of the ship Eliza. The illustration provided a panorama of the town from the water. Small Pox Epidemic: 1830s In the late 1830s an epidemic of smallpox ravaged the North Coast resulting in the death of more than half the Haida (though others have estimated the deaths to be closer to 80 to 90 per cent of the population.)xv With the reduced population, trade became monopolized by a smaller number of chiefs. Over the next quarter- century other chiefs, including Chief Edenshaw of Kiusta, had to establish stronger links with other chiefs as a result of their remote location and dwindling population and many gravitated to Masset where there were missionaries and other service and commercial people.ibid p. 15  Abalone trade  Evidence of trade in abalone shells is based in part on recovered abalone shells from a site in Kiusta. it is suggested that traders imported California-area abalone shell because \\"they had noticed local peoples' use of \\"paler, smaller\\" abalone. Such importation was likely done by American traders who dominated the sea otter pelt trade in the Haida Gwaii area from the mid-1790s to the 1840s (Lyle Dick, Parks Canada, pers. comm. 2001).\\"p. 279 Sloan, N.

JSTOR, JSTOR This trade is important as the \\"Haida used abalone shell fragments for personal adornment including labrets, jewellery, appliqu√© on garments, inlay into personal ceremonial dress such as frontlets, and inlay in argillite carvings for sale (Barbeau 1953). Boas (1898: 15) reports that sometimes pieces were glued directly to the skin for facial decoration.\\", and some families adopted abalone shells as crests.ibid 276-277  Edenshaw  \\"The name Edenshaw is first mentioned by fur traders of the 1790s. As with all Haida chiefly names, it was passed down the matrilineal line to a chief's eldest sister's son. At least one Chief Edenshaw preceded the one who dominated most of the nineteenth century, Albert Edward Edenshaw. Albert Edward Edenshaw built his house in Kiusta around 1840 after the details of the carvings on the corner posts, rafter ends and frontal pole were revealed to him in a dream. He named it Story House, and it stood on the site of his predecessor's dwelling, called Property House. When Story House was finished, Albert Edward gave a great potlatch and invited guests from Masset, Skidegate, Kaisun and Cha'atl, as well as from Kaigani villages. The noted artist Charles Edenshaw, who was Albert Edward's nephew and heir, made a model of Story House for John R. Swanton, and it is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.ibid  Stastas Eagles  The Stastas Eagles are part of the Eagle contingent on the north coast of the Islands. It has been suggested that the Stastas originated outside of the Islands, some probably on the Stikine River and others on the Nass River. Although most of their lands were around Rose Spit, at the northeastern tip of the Islands, and in Naden Harbour, they were town chiefs of Kiusta village at the northwest end.ibid p. 14 Art mapping \\"In 1966 the National Museum of Man launched a major programme of prehistoric research on the northern coast of British Columbia. ‚Ä¶Mapping began at the village of Kiusta in Cloak Bay in 1966‚Ä¶ extensive files on each village were compiled, including references to village histories, house ownership, and the identification of the figures on the carved columns commonly known as totem poles. Over ten thousand historical photographs, assembled from museum and archive collections in North America and Europe, proved invaluable in checking the authenticity of the site maps. Careful records of the date and location of the photographs kept by the photographers, most of whom were attached to government survey parties, establish dates for the houses and monuments.

Hayes announced that he would not seek re-election in 1880. Thus, the 1880 election ended up being fought between Republican James A. Garfield, the winner, and Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock. Democratic nomination fight Winfield Scott Hancock After winning control of both houses of the U.S. Congress in 1878, Democrats felt that voters could elect a Democrat as U.S. President for the first time in 24 years. Early frontrunner 1876 Democratic candidate and former New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden decided not to run because of his health and the opposition of Tammany Hall leader John Kelly. With Tilden's withdrawal, other Democrats entered the race; however, they all had issues. Senator Thomas Bayard of Delaware alienated soft-money supporters with his hard-money stance; his initial support of Southern secession during the American Civil War had also made him vulnerable to Republican attacks. House Speaker Samuel J. Randall was unwilling to campaign and further damaged by Tilden's refusal to endorse him. Meanwhile, 1868 Democratic nominee and former New York Governor Horatio Seymour declined to run again. Other candidates failed to attract significant support. The party settled on former Union general Winfield Scott Hancock. He was acceptable to all factions of the party, had a reputation for integrity, and had no negatives. Hancock won the Democratic nomination with 705 delegates on the second ballot at the 1880 Democratic National Convention. Former Indiana congressman William Hayden English was selected as Hancock's running mate. Campaign The 1880 Democratic platform was kept vague to hold the party together and avoid alienating any voters. During the campaign, Hancock and the Democrats attacked James A. Garfield, the Republican nominee, for his involvement in the Credit Mobilier scandal and his alleged support of unlimited Chinese immigration as evidenced by the forged Morey letter, which Garfield publicly denied having written. Meanwhile, Republicans attacked the Democrats by associating them with the Confederacy and calling attention to their alleged support for low protective tariffs in contrast to Republican support for higher tariffs. Republicans made much of Hancock's statement that \\"the tariff question is a local question\\". The former general had meant merely that it was for the voters to decide through their elected representatives in Congress, but it was used to suggest he did not understand the issue. Republicans avoided direct attacks on Hancock's character, instead focusing on his lack of political experience. They also circulated partisan rumors about how he had allegedly plotted to overthrow President Lincoln during the Civil War and had engaged in corrupt business practices while serving in Louisiana during Reconstruction. Results Garfield ended up winning the popular vote by less than 0.1% (less than 10,000 votes) although he took a 214‚Äì155 majority of the Electoral College. Garfield won New York, Indiana, and Connecticut, all of which had voted for Tilden in 1876, allowing him to defeat Hancock. The Morey letter may have helped Hancock narrowly win both California and Nevada. References 1880 United States presidential election James A.

Born Ina Rains in Windsor, Colorado, Souez was of Cherokee extraction; she took her maternal grandmother's name as her own when she embarked upon her career. She studied under Florence Hinman in Denver, and in 1931 traveled to Europe, taking further lessons with Sofia del Campo in Milan. She made her debut as Mimi in Ivrea in 1928, and was soon singing at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo. In May 1929 she bowed as Li√π at the Royal Opera House to the Turandot of Eva Turner. Although she was very well-received, she was not reengaged. For the following decade she remained in England, eventually attracting the attention of Hamish Wilson, who suggested her for a position at the Glyndebourne Festival. Souez appeared at Glyndebourne for the first time on the second night of the inaugural festival, May 29, 1934, singing Fiordiligi; married at the time to an Englishman, she was billed as an English singer. Her performance was sensationally received, and the Royal Opera House quickly engaged her for the upcoming season; this created a problem for Glyndebourne, as they had taken it for granted that she would return and so had not bothered signing her up for the following festival year. In the event she was able to discharge both obligations, but was once again not reengaged in London. She also sang Donna Anna for Glyndebourne, in 1936, and appeared in Stockholm and The Hague as well before returning to the United States on the outbreak of World War II. During this time she also recorded Don Giovanni and Cos√¨ fan tutte, the first commercial recordings either piece would receive. Souez joined the Women's Army Corps after her return. She appeared a few more times in New York, but retired from opera to become a jazz singer in 1945. Souez spent the next part of her career touring with Spike Jones and his band, often the butt of many of their jokes. Of the experience, she said that Jones \\"was offering me some real money\\"; she remained with him for more than ten years before retiring to teach voice in San Francisco and Los Angeles. She spent the last few years of her life in a nursing home in Santa Monica. She is buried at the Los Angeles National Cemetery.

Irma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30, 2017. The storm quickly became a hurricane on August 31 and then a major hurricane shortly thereafter, but would oscillate in intensity over the next few days. By September 4, Irma resumed strengthening, and became a powerful Category 5 hurricane on the following day. The cyclone then struck Saint Maarten and the British Virgin Islands on September 6 and later crossed Little Inagua in the Bahamas on September 8. Irma briefly weakened to a Category 4, but re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall in the Sabana-Camag√ºey Archipelago of Cuba. After falling to Category 3 status due to land interaction, the storm re-strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane in the Straits of Florida. Irma struck Florida twice on September 10 ‚Äì the first as a Category 4 at Cudjoe Key and the second on Marco Island as a Category 3\\\\. The hurricane weakened significantly over Florida and was reduced to a tropical storm before exiting the state into Georgia on September 11. Preparations for the hurricane began nearly a week before it struck the Keys, beginning with Governor Rick Scott declaring a state of emergency on September 4. With both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the state threatened, record evacuations ensued with an estimated 6.5 million people relocating statewide. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for all Monroe County‚Äîthough roughly 25% of residents stayed‚Äîand portions of 23 other counties. The large-scale evacuation strained roadways, with gridlock reported along Interstates 75, 95, and Florida's Turnpike. A total of 191,764 people sought refuge in public shelters. All major airports saw disruption of services, resulting in the cancellation of 9,000 flights. Professional- and college-level athletics saw substantial schedule adjustments due to the storm. The storm's large wind field resulted in strong winds across the entire state except for the western Panhandle. The strongest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the highest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though stronger winds likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys. Over 7.7 million homes and businesses were without power at some point ‚Äì about 73% of electrical customers in the state. Precipitation was generally heavy to the east of the storm's path, peaking at in Fort Pierce. Heavy rainfall ‚Äì and storm surge, in some instances ‚Äì caused at least 32 rivers and creeks to overflow, resulting in significant flooding, especially along the St. Johns River and its tributaries. Many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, including over 65,000 structures in West Central and Southwest Florida alone. Agriculture was also hit hard, suffering about $2.5 billion (2017 USD) in damage. It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane left at least 84 fatalities across 27 counties, including 12 at a nursing home due to sweltering conditions and lack of power in the hurricane's aftermath. Background A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 27. After three days, the system organized into a tropical cyclone to the west of the Cape Verde Islands. Initially classified as a tropical storm, Irma quickly intensified under favorable environmental conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, becoming a hurricane on August 31. Later that day, the storm reached major hurricane status, becoming a Category 3 hurricane. However, Irma oscillated in intensity over the next few days due to drier air. By September 4, Irma resumed strengthening, becoming a powerful Category 5 hurricane with 180 mph (285 km/h) ‚Äì and the most intense tropical cyclone over the open Atlantic ‚Äì on the following day. The hurricane then struck Sint Maarten and the British Virgin Islands on September 6 and later crossed Little Inagua in the Bahamas on September 8. Irma briefly weakened to a Category 4, but re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall in the Sabana-Camag√ºey Archipelago of Cuba. After falling to Category 2 status due to land interaction, the storm re-strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane in the Straits of Florida. At 13:10 UTC on September 10, Irma made landfall on Cudjoe Key as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). Moving northward and weakening, the hurricane made a second landfall in Florida on Marco Island at 19:35 UTC with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). The hurricane weakened significantly over Florida and was reduced to a tropical storm before exiting the state into Georgia on September 11. Hurricane Irma making landfall over the Florida Keys Irma was the first major hurricane to strike the state since Wilma in 2005 and the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Charley in 2004. The storm made landfall in Florida on the same date as Hurricane Donna, the last Category 4 hurricane to strike the Florida Keys. Irma was only the second hurricane to hit Florida since Wilma, the other being Hermine in 2016. Due to few very intense hurricanes since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, there was concern that many Floridians never experienced or did not recall experiencing a hurricane as strong as Irma was projected to be at landfall, with significant growth in population and assets during the previous 25 years. Preparations Doral installing hurricane shutters in advance of the storm Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on September 4. Several local state of emergencies were declared. A total of 100 members of the Florida National Guard were initially placed on duty by Governor Scott to assist in preparations, while all 9,000 troops were required to report for duty by September 8. Officials encouraged residents to stock-up on emergency supplies. The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated. Governor Scott waived tolls on all toll roads in the state, including on Florida's Turnpike. All state offices were closed from September 8 to 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period. The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose. By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed. Many airports throughout the state, including the Albert Whitted Airport, Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, Downtown Fort Lauderdale Heliport, Everglades Airpark, Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood International Airport, Immokalee Regional Airport, Marco Island Airport, Miami Executive Airport, Miami Homestead General Aviation Airport, Miami International Airport, Miami Seaplane Base, Naples Municipal Airport, North Perry Airport, Okeechobee County, Opa-Locka Executive Airport, Palm Beach International Airport, St. George Island, St. Pete-Clearwater International, Tallahassee International, Tavares Seaplane Base, and the Florida Keys Marathon airports, were closed. Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled. Along Florida's coasts, the seaports of Port Canaveral, Port of Key West, Port Manatee, Port of Miami, Port of Palm Beach, and Port Everglades, and Port of St. Petersburg were closed, while the ports at Port of Fernandina, Port of Jacksonville, Port of Panama City, and Port of Pensacola were opened, but with restricted access. For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm. Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground closed on September 9 at 2:00 p.m. due to its location in a heavily wooded area of the resort, while the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Blizzard Beach, Typhoon Lagoon and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12. Other Orlando metropolitan area theme parks and water parks, including Universal Orlando Resort's Universal's Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios Florida, Universal's Volcano Bay and SeaWorld Orlando Resort and Aquatica Orlando, were also closed. The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to 15. Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites. At the time, the EPA had 54 Superfund sites in Florida. A survey conducted a few years before the hurricane indicated that a storm surge of just could flood Superfund sites in low-lying areas of South Florida, potentially causing toxic waste to enter aquifers used for drinking water. Watches and warnings 'Florida Governor Rick Scott on Evacuations' video from Voice of America The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued watches and warnings in Florida as Irma approached the state. At 15:00 UTC on September 7, a hurricane watch was issued for parts of South Florida, from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee. The hurricane watch area was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 03:00 UTC on September 8, while a new hurricane watch was issued on the west coast from Bonita Beach to Anna Maria Island and on the east coast from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet. Twelve hours later, the watches were extended northward on the west coast to the Anclote River and on the east coast to the Flagler-Volusia county line. At 21:00 UTC on September 8, the hurricane watch along the Gulf Coast was stretched to the Suwannee River; the hurricane warning was simultaneously modified to include all areas from Sebastian Inlet southward along the Florida peninsula to Anna Maria Island, as well as the Florida Keys. Early on September 9, the hurricane watch on the Gulf Coast was extended to Indian Pass, while the hurricane watch on the Atlantic coast was stretched northward to Fernandina Beach. The hurricane warning was changed to include areas from the Anclote River southward on the west coast and from the Brevard-Volusia county line southward along the east coast.

Plywood boards shield the Conch Tour Train building in Key West A record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state's history. Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida's Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC's forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast. Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma's arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol. Use of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9. It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations. The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic. Throughout the state, nearly 700 emergency shelters were opened. The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida, including 31,092 in Miami-Dade County, 17,263 in Palm Beach County, 17,040 in Collier County, and 17,000 in Broward County.

The river reached a record height or major flood stage at several other locations, including at the Buckman Bridge, Buffalo Bluff, Dames Point Bridge, and Naval Station Mayport. Additionally, record heights were reached on the Clapboard Creek near Sheffield Road; Dunn Creek at Dunn Creek Road; the Cedar River at State Road 128; the Julington Creek at Old St. Augustine Road; the Nassau River near Tisonia; the Pottsburg Creek at Beach Boulevard and Bowden Road; and the Ortega River at Argyle Forest Boulevard. Winds downed multiple trees fell at the National Weather Service office in Jacksonville, with one falling onto the sign and damaging it. One home was deroofed in the Sans Souci neighborhood. Major flooding occurred in the St. Johns River basin. Several buildings and homes were flooded, with water reaching about in some homes. Emergency crews conducted about 350 water rescues, especially in Downtown Jacksonville and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods. Farther west, heavy rainfall inundated the ramps onto Interstate 10 at Cassat Avenue, while the Yellow Water Creek overflowed at State Road 228, causing the road to be closed. Damage in Jacksonville was estimated at about $85 million. In Jacksonville Beach, storm surge and abnormally high tides washed away of sand from the dunes, though the dunes protected the city from major coastal flooding. Heavy rainfall flooded The Sanctuary subdivision, with water entering several homes. Wind damage was reported along 1st Street South, including uprooted trees, toppled fences, and some roof damage. Five deaths occurred in the county, with three from cardiac arrest and two by drowning. =Nassau County= Much of Nassau County experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, though a private weather station at the south end of Amelia Island observed a wind gust of . The winds left 26,612 customers without power ‚Äì approximately 59% of the county's electrical subscribers. Heavy rains fell in some areas, with a peak total of in Fernandina Beach. Tides along the coast reached above normal in Fernandina Beach. Inland, storm surge and abnormally high tides caused the St. Marys River to crest at at Interstate 95, which is minor flood stage. Irma spawned two tornadoes in Nassau County. The first tornado, an EF0 tornado spawned near Yulee, mostly left damage to trees and shrubs before dissipating. The other tornado, also an EF0, left similar impact, after touching down on northern Amelia Island near Fernandina Beach and then crossing marshlands before dissipating north of Becker. Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in the vicinity of Hilliard, with water inundating streets and approaching homes. Throughout Nassau County, 30 homes suffered major damage and 102 others sustained minor to moderate structural impact. Damage was estimated at just over $9 million. One death occurred in the county when a man was cutting down a tree, but the tree fell on a power line, snapping a power pole, which struck his head. In Baker County, winds downed many trees, including large trees near Macclenny. A total of 5,341 electrical customers were left without power, which was approximately 47% of the county. Rainfall totals peaked at about north of Olustee. Falling trees and flooding left many roads impassable. The precipitation elevated creeks and rivers. The St. Marys Rivers crested at near Macclenny and at near Moniac, Georgia, which was major flood stage at both locations. =Florida Panhandle= Rainfall totals throughout the United States Much of the eastern Florida Panhandle observed tropical storm force winds, downing power lines and trees, some of which fell on cars, roofs, and streets. Along the coast, winds blew water away from land, rather than generate storm surge, with water receding more than in some areas. In Taylor County, damage was mainly limited to downed power lines and trees, with a few falling onto houses. Three homes suffered major damage and two homes experienced minor damage. At the height of the storm, all electrical customers in the county ‚Äì a total of 12,916 ‚Äì were left without power. Two indirect deaths occurred, both by carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator. In Madison County, trees and power lines were toppled in many areas, with two falling onto Interstate 10, blocking traffic. Falling trees damaged two roofs. Throughout the county, 12 homes were damaged, with 3 sustaining major damage. In Jefferson County, sustained winds reached about and gusts topped out at . Winds uprooted or damage 338 trees, with 1 hitting a house and several falling onto roads. The storm also downed 224 power lines, which at one point left 8,113 customers ‚Äì 100% of the county ‚Äì without electricity. Tropical storm force wind gusts were observed in Leon County for about eight hours, with the highest wind gust of being observed at the Tallahassee International Airport. Power lines were downed across the county, with approximately 70,000 customers left without electricity, including roughly 40,000 in Tallahassee. Trees were also toppled throughout the county, with roads blocked at 200 different locations. A total of 29 homes were inflicted with minor damage, 4 were inflicted major damage, and 1 was destroyed. Two fatalities occurred in the county, with one from chest trauma and the other by blunt trauma and respiratory failure. Winds uprooted 98 trees in Wakulla County, with 50 falling onto power lines, three falling onto structures, and two falling onto vehicles. Nearly all of the trees blocked streets or posed a threat to traffic, with U.S. Route 98 blocked from State Road 267 to State Road 363. About 8,700 power outages were reported. Throughout Wakulla County, the storm inflicted minor damage to three homes, major damage to six homes, and destroyed one home. Some downed trees and power lines were reported in Liberty County, but there was no structural damage. There were five weather-related car accidents in the county, one of which resulted in a death. In Jackson County, many electrical wires and trees were knocked over, blocking streets and extensively damaging two homes. Several trees were also downed in Franklin County, damaging some homes and causing power outages. In Bay County, sporadic power outages were reported and a fire station suffered minor damage. Impact in Calhoun, Gulf, Holmes, and Washington counties was mostly limited to a few downed trees and power lines, with a downed tree in Washington County blocking traffic on Interstate 10. Aftermath Types of disaster assistance by county Prior to the storm, Governor Rick Scott submitted a request on September 10 for federal assistance to those who would be impacted by Irma, which President Donald Trump approved hours later. The declaration expended public assistance to all 67 counties, allowing up to 75% reimbursement for debris removal, emergency work, and restoration of damaged public facilities. Additionally, Native American tribes and all 67 counties became eligible to apply for monetary aid via the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Nine counties ‚Äì Charlotte, Collier, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Pinellas, and Sarasota ‚Äì were initially eligible for individual assistance, which is aid for households and individuals. By October 12, the declaration had been amended to designate 39 additional counties as eligible for individual assistance, those counties were: Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Clay, Columbia, DeSoto, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Gilchrist, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Highlands, Indian River, Lafayette, Lake, Levy, Marion, Martin, Nassau, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pasco, Polk, Putnam, Seminole, St. Johns, St. Lucie, Sumter, Suwannee, Union, and Volusia. Upon the individual assistance application deadline on November 24, 752,034 applications for individual assistance had been accepted, with over $946.2 million approved for individual and households program. Some victims of the hurricane received aid through several other federal agencies. By December 19, the Small Business Administration had approved more than $1 billion in low-interest disaster assistance loans. More than 5,900 Floridians who lost income or became unemployed as a result of the hurricane were collectively compensated with about $3.2 million via the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program. The National Flood Insurance Program paid out approximately $519.8 million to those who filed claims. Operation Blue Roof, an Army Corps of Engineers program to repair damaged roofs, installed 13,370 temporary roofs. President Trump meeting with FEMA Administrator Brock Long and Senator Marco Rubio in Fort Myers on September 14 Following the storm, more than 6.7 million meals, 10.7 million liters of water, 71,000 tarps, and 13,000 cots were distributed by the State Emergency Response Team. In addition to federal aid, businesses damaged by the storm also receive $10 million in aid via the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program. The United States Department of Agriculture, per a request from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agreed to provide free breakfast and lunch to K‚Äì12 public school students until October 20 in the 48 counties under FEMA's major disaster declaration. On September 19, the Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran established the Select Committee on Hurricane Response and Preparedness. In their final report in January 2018, the committee issued 77 recommendations for improvements to mitigation, preparations, and recovery in relation to a hurricane. On September 11, Scott and U.S. senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio toured damaged areas throughout the state, including the Florida Keys. Three days later, President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, a delegation of White House cabinet officials, FEMA Administrator Brock Long, Scott, and Senator Rubio assessed damage in the Florida Keys, Naples, and Fort Myers. While in Fort Myers, Trump encouraged Scott ‚Äì who is barred from running for a third term as governor in 2018 ‚Äì to run for senator in 2018. Scott's response to Irma was overwhelmingly approved of, with a poll conducted by the Florida Chamber of Commerce indicating that 91% of state residents approved of his handling of the disaster. The poll also showed Scott leading potential opponent Nelson by 47%‚Äì45%. On April 9, 2018, Rick Scott declared his candidacy for United States Senate. In the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded their surrounding land, including residential areas. Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane. A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to get into the local water supply is significant. One example of an illness that can get into the water supply is leptospirosis, which is caused by rat urine being in the floodwaters. If people are exposed to leptospirosis and do not get treatment, it can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure. Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk. The hurricane left significant damage to the state's citrus industry. Just 31 million boxes of oranges were produced during the growing season that ended on September 30, the smallest Florida orange crop since 1942. Governor Scott and the congressional delegates from Florida proposed amending an additional $2.5 billion to the devastate relief bill for the purpose of assisting not only the citrus growers in recovery, but also other sectors of the agricultural industry hit hard by the storm. However, Congress ultimately excluded the $2.5 billion earmark for Florida's agriculture industry recovery in the disaster relief package passed on October 24. The citrus industry suffered additional damage in early January 2018 due to cold temperatures in association with a powerful blizzard. As a result, the USDA projected that only 46 million boxes of citrus fruits would be collected in the 2017‚Äì18 growing season, the smallest crop since 1945. According to a September 2018 report, Monroe County lost an estimated 4% of its population due to the reduction in available housing. FEMA ended its temporary housing program for Irma victims in March 2019. FEMA reimbursements were still being made to local governments and destroyed buildings were still being reconstructed as of June 2019. Hollywood nursing home Local and state authorities quickly began an investigation into the deaths at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills in Broward County. The facility did not have a backup generator to operate the air conditioning system during the power outage. For unknown reasons, the nursing home was not listed on FPL's priority restoration list. After multiple 9-1-1 calls from the nursing home on September 13, paramedics and staff from a nearby hospital arrived at the scene and found many patients suffering from heat stroke or a fever, with some having a body temperature as high as . Over 100 patients were transported to nearby hospitals due to respiratory distress and heat-related issues, though at least 8 died at the nursing home, with a total of 12 patients ultimately perishing. A lawyer hired by the family of one victim stated that the facility had more than a week to prepare and accused the nursing home of putting profits ahead of safety. In October, Governor Scott implemented emergency rules requiring assisted living facilities and nursing homes to have generators that capable of operating air conditioners for up to four days in the event of a power outage. On November 22, the 12 deaths at the nursing home were ruled to be homicides by heat exposure. Court hearings for the potential permanent revocation of the nursing home's license began on January 29, 2018. The deaths at the Hollywood Hills nursing home prompted an immediate response from Florida lawmakers. Governor Scott signed an executive order mandating nursing facilities to have plans in place to supply emergency power for four days in the event of a power outage. Calling the incident \\"a tragedy of gargantuan proportion\\", Representative Frederica Wilson proposed all nursing and assisted-living facilities have backup generators and the ability to run air conditioning with generator power. By September 19, Senator Lauren Book filed a bill that would require such facilities to be able to use generator power for five days. About twelve bills related to nursing homes and generators were filed in the 2018 Florida Legislative session.

Life and career Amram was born in Sana'a, Yemen in 1939 to Romia and Shlomo Amram, a rabbi. In 1950 he immigrated to Israel as part of Operation Magic Carpet which was designed to bring Yemenite Jews to Israel, where he landed in the refugee camp of Rosh HaAyin. He was quickly singled out for his beautiful voice and started singing at weddings and events. With the encouragement of the Speaker of the Knesset Yisrael Yeshayahu he studied at the conservatory in Tel-Aviv where he was faced with the choice of focusing on either classical music or Yemenite music due to the difference in singing styles. Having chosen the latter, Amram began to record dozens of short recordings while continuing to perform. As he started getting recognition for his work, he toured in Europe in the early 1960s including a show at the Olympia in Paris and a filmed performance for the BBC in London. He was married in 1968 and had six children. Amram released many records through the 1960s and 1970s which cemented his status as a singer in Israel and within the Yemenite community and inspired many Israeli Yemenite singers such as Achinoam Nini,http://www.noasmusic.com/genes-jeans/ Ofra Haza or Zohar Argov. At this time he also wrote the song Galbi which was to become a worldwide hit after being sung by Ofra Haza. Preservation of Jewish Yemenite heritage Amram considered Jewish Yemenite music his calling and dedicated his later years to preserving it, as well as the community's traditional religious chants and customs. He recorded all five books of the Torah along with prayers, psalms, Shabbat songs and other liturgical traditions on over 120 CDs.

Biography Fraser was the eldest son of Thomas Fraser, 2nd Lord Lovat (died 1524) and Janet Gordon, daughter of Sir Alexander Gordon of Abergeldie. He enlarged the family's portfolio of lands, purchasing a number of estates and receiving several more as royal grants, including a feu-charter of the lands of Beaufort. Lovat became involved, with tragic consequences, in the succession dispute within Clanranald triggered by the death of the 7th chief, Alexander Macdonald, in c.1530. With the support of Ewen Cameron of Lochiel (d. 1547), chief of Clan Cameron, whose clan was on the rise in Lochaber owing to a period of strong crown pressure on Clan Donald, Alexander's son John Moidartach was installed as the 8th chief of the clan. However, Cameron's meddling in the affair was resented by the most powerful peer in northern Scotland, George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly, a nephew of James V. In 1540, John was arrested and imprisoned by the king, and his uncle, Ranald Gallda, promptly asserted his own claim to the chiefship of Clanranald with Lovat's backing, declaring John's birth to be illegitimate. After John's release from prison and return to Lochaber, Ranald was unable to cling to power and fled to Lovat, who gave him refuge. Cameron having joined the Macdonalds on a punitive raid of Lovat's lands in Stratherrick and Abertarff, Huntly marched to Lovat's aid and joined the Frasers on a retaliatory raid of Moidart. Returning east from this raid by a different route from Huntly, Lovat was pursued by a force of Macdonalds and Camerons, who overtook the Frasers at the head of Loch Lochy on 15 July 1544. Battle was joined, and the result was an unqualified disaster for Clan Fraser of Lovat: Lovat himself was killed, along with his brother James, his eldest son Simon, and some three hundred men of his clan. Although Ranald Gallda too was slain in the battle of Loch Lochy, leaving John Moidartach secure in the chiefship, an enraged Huntly swiftly returned to Lochaber in force and arrested Cameron, who was put to death at Elgin in 1547.

He was the son of Josias Tookerman, a clergyman, and younger brother of Josias Tookerman II, a clergyman sent by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) to Jamaica. He married Katherine Grant, widow of John Grant of Charleston, South Carolina by 1717. As a pirate, smuggler, and trader active in the Caribbean and the Carolinas, he became best known for involvement with pirates Stede Bonnet and Bartholomew Roberts. History Tookerman was born in England and grew up in Jamaica before moving to Charleston. He made his fortune making trading runs between the Carolinas and the Bahamas, supplying goods to the pirate-friendly colonies there. When Charleston merchants wanted to outfit two sloops in 1718 to hunt down pirates plaguing their waterways, one of the ones they commandeered was Tookerman‚Äôs 50-ton, 8-gun Sea Nymph. They left it under the command of Tookerman‚Äôs acquaintance Fayrer Hall. The two sloops under Colonel William Rhett went looking for Charles Vane but instead found Blackbeard‚Äôs prot√©g√© Stede Bonnet. Hall was an experienced sailor but beached the Sea Nymph far from Bonnet‚Äôs ship, leaving him unable to help Rhett for most of the battle; speculation was that Tookerman advised or bribed Hall not to engage the pirates and risk damaging the Sea Nymph. Hall also used the Sea Nymph when Charleston again marshaled forces to capture pirates, this time Richard Worley in 1719. Bonnet was captured and imprisoned, but escaped in October 1718 with his ship‚Äôs master David Herriot. Tookerman provided them with arms, canoes, and slave guides and they rowed out of the harbor, where strong winds forced them ashore at Sullivan‚Äôs Island. Rhett took a party to retrieve him; Herriot and the slaves were killed and Bonnet was returned to custody, after which he was tried and hung. Tookerman was suspected of helping Bonnet escape; the canoes and arms were his, and Bonnet reportedly had been promised that a sloop (Tookerman‚Äôs) would pick him up once he escaped. Governor Johnson imprisoned Tookerman but had to release him for lack of evidence. Tookerman was notoriously litigious, filing lawsuits and counter-suits against Rhett and many others. In March 1719 Tookerman was arrested again, this time for receiving stolen property (which he had actually robbed from Rhett‚Äôs home). He escaped, fleeing first to Virginia and then back to Barbados. He soon sailed with fellow pirate Daniel Porter, who together with his brother Thomas Porter had been associates of Benjamin Hornigold. By June 1720 Tookerman and Porter were sailing aboard Porter‚Äôs sloop Mayflower. They approached Bartholomew Roberts for advice on taking to piracy. Roberts, amused by their request, gave them supplies and his blessing. Roberts also traded sailors with them, trading eighteen black slaves to them for four of their crew. He and his crew remarked that Tookerman and Porter were not typical pirates but were ‚Äúprivate pirates‚Äù ‚Äì those who made money trading with pirates without doing any real piracy of their own. Governor Woodes Rogers noted rumors in 1721 that Tookerman had turned to piracy with Porter. Tookerman was arrested again in June of that year in Port Royal for firing a salute on King James II‚Äôs birthday, betraying his Jacobite sympathies. By this time he was serving as ship‚Äôs master aboard the Adventure under Captain Henry Wills. Tookerman was sent to London for trial but was granted a writ of Habeas Corpus allowing him to be tried in Charleston. Tookerman died en route home from the Caribbean in 1723.

He was from Qiantang (in modern Hangzhou). His courtesy name was Meicheng (), and his art name was Qingzhen Jushi (). He left a two-volume poetry anthology called either the Qingzhen-ji or the Pianyu-ci.  Biography   Birth and early life  Zhou Bangyan was born in 1056. He was a native of Qiantang (Èå¢Â°ò/Èí±Â°ò Qi√°nt√°ng, modern-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province).  Political career  At the age of 23, Zhou went to live in the capital Bianliang as a student at the National Academy. In 1083 he published \\"Rhapsody on the capital\\" (Ê±¥ÈÉΩË≥¶ Biandu fu), which described the bustle of Bianliang while also praising the Song dynasty's accomplishments. The poem pleased Emperor Shenzong, and Zhou was appointed Supervisor at the National Academy (Â§™Â≠∏Ê≠£/Â§™Â≠¶Ê≠£ taixuezheng). In 1087, at the age of 31, Zhou was sent to Lu Prefecture in Anhui where he worked as an instructor (ÊïôÊéà). He stayed in the provinces for ten years, mostly as Sub-prefect of Lishui County in Jiangsu, before Emperor Zhezong recalled him in 1097 to be Registrar of the National Academy (ÂúãÂ≠ê‰∏ªÁ∞ø). He found favour with Emperor Zhezong and his successor Emperor Huizong, and thereafter rose through the ranks in the central government. He left the capital in 1112 to serve as Prefect of Longde-fu (ÈöÜÂæ∑Â∫ú, in the area of present-day Changzhi) and Mingzhou (ÊòéÂ∑û), before returning in 1116 to become Director of the Palace Library (ÁßòÊõ∏Áõ£), the highest position he received.  Later life and death  In 1118 Zhou was again assigned a prefectural post. After three transfers, he died in Nanjing (present-day Shangqiu) in 1121, aged 66.  Names  His courtesy name was Meicheng, and his art name was Qingzhen Jushi.  Works  Zhou is especially famous as a composer of ci, a form of poetry that began in the Tang era and flourished during the Song Dynasty. His complex and elegant poetic style is noted for its polished and elaborate form, and has been praised as \\"simple and honest, and elegant\\" (Ê∏æÂéöÂíåÈõÖ). His two- volume poetry anthology is called the Qingzhen-ji (Ê∏ÖÁúüÈõÜ) or the Pianyu-ci (ÁâáÁéâË©û). Zhou was a noted composer of tunes and lyrics, working in close association with the imperial Music Bureau (Â§ßÊôüÂ∫ú Dashengfu), which presided over court music. He was a proficient musician, and set many of his own poems to music.  Reception  He became known as the \\"Patriarch of Ci Poets\\" (Ë©ûÂÆ∂Ê≠£ÂÆó), and is listed along with Liu Yong, Xin Qiji and Jiang Kui as the \\"Four Great Ci Poets\\". His poetry served as a model for ci poets of later eras, with many imitators among the Southern Song literati. One example is the He Qingzhen-ci (ÂíåÊ∏ÖÁúüË©û) by Fang Qianli (ÊñπÂçÉÈáå). Chen Yuanlong (Èô≥ÂÖÉÈæç) of the Southern Song composed a ten-volume commentary on his poetry entitled Pianyu-ji (ÁâáÁéâÈõÜ).

At the time of its creation, the Munno Para West council area was bounded on the south by the Little Para River (which derives its name from the aboriginal term pari meaning \\"stream of flowing water\\") and on the north by the Gawler River and included the rural townships of Virginia, Smithfield, Penfield, Angle Vale, Salisbury North, St Kilda and Gawler Blocks, the latter being severed by the District Council of Gawler South in 1899 and later merged with the Corporate Town of Gawler.

He was the only son of Hugh Fraser, 1st Lord Lovat (died c. 1500/c. 1501) and Violetta Lyon, daughter of Patrick Lyon, 1st Lord Glamis, through whom he was a great-great- great-grandson of Robert II. Apart from a range of land transactions, little is known of his life. Lovat married, first, Janet Gordon, the daughter of Sir Alexander Gordon of Abergeldie, with whom he had three sons (Hugh, William and James) and three daughters (Margaret, Isobel and Janet). His second marriage was to Janet Gray, the daughter of Patrick, Master of Gray, with whom he had three sons (Robert, Andrew and Thomas). Thomas was middle-aged when his father, Hugh died. His claim to fame was always about the ill-fated marriage to Margaret, the sister of Harry, daughter of King Henry VII for his King. James IV court returned with the princess for a marriage, attended by all the great Scots Highland lords in a spirit of reconciliation and renewal. Bagpipes filled the halls of Holyrood, and a parliament also met in Edinburgh. It immediately appointed sheriffs to the Highlands to assert legal and military control. Traditional Sheriffs of Inverness, Lord Lovat frequently perambulated his estate arresting lawless marauders and punishing delinquents. A 'precept of sasine' guaranteed the king's support for Thomas claim to his father's estates, as well as third to the barony of Aird and Abertarff, and to many other lands in the Glenelg. On 14 October 1501, the King recognised Lovat's barony of Kinnell. And a month later he came into his wife's lands at Dalcorse, Janet Gray. Critics of Lovat's rule indicate how arbitrary judgements caused injustice. Declaratory speeches from the Moot Hill of Scoon are a mock-up of justice. Lovat claimed the precedence of Viking courts held high on a hill when he tried to regulate everything from the price of food to clothing. At the same time many of his properties burnt down in the lawless Highland countryside defying every attempt at court management. In one case he unlawfully appointed the chaplain to Inverness parish church, which under Sheriff court law was not in his gift of patronage, and alienated right to Sir Nicholas Barron. But when in 1518 his kin, James Fraser, bishop of Moray wished to presentment, and yet Lovat yielded the living to Sir John Scot.

Rising from the Aquetong Spring, now known as Ingham Spring, just south of the intersection of U.S. Route 202, Lower Mountain Road, and Ingham Road, it runs about to its confluence with the Delaware. History The area surrounding Aquetong Creek was occupied by the Lenape people until the lower portion of what is now Bucks County was acquired by the Penn colony. The Lenape called the spring \\"Achewetong\\" or \\"Achewetank\\" meaning \\"at the spring among the bushes\\". A Lenape village was located at the spring up until about 1690. On 1 November 1710, James Logan, secretary to Penn and later mayor of Philadelphia, was granted of land including the area of the spring. In 1707, Robert and Richard Heath built a gristmill along the Aquetong and on 2 November 1710, Richard was granted of land from the confluence of the Aquetong to the Delaware to include the lower Aquetong valley and the mill. A fulling mill was constructed as early as 1712 by Phillip Williams. The first sawmill on the Aquetong appeared in 1740. In 1747 Jonathan Ingham purchased the Logan tract and constructed a fulling mill below the spring, who passed it on to his son, Dr. Jonathan Ingham, who passed it on to his son, Samuel D. Ingham, famous as President Jackson's Secretary of the Treasury, who took possession in 1800. Later, Samuel likely abandoned the fuller mill and built the Ingham Springs Paper Mill, operating until his passing in 1860.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, pp10-14. Aquetong Spring, as it was known by the Lenape, later known as Ingham Spring or the Great Spring, was said to have flowed as much as 3 million gallons per day. The spring flowed a short distance to a dam constructed in 1870 to produce Aquetong Lake or Pond, then flowed in Aquetong Creek generally eastward to the Delaware River in New Hope, PA. The dam has been recently removed to return the pond to its original pre-dam condition. Statistics The drainage basin of Aquetong Creek covers about in Solebury Township and the Borough of New Hope.

The 279th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on September 20, 2017. The episode's plot concerns Craig's attempts to assuage Tweek's anxieties over the contemporary issues parodied in the episode, including the relations between North Korea and the United States following the 2017 North Korean nuclear tests, distracted driving, and the impact of Donald Trump on social media. Plot Tweek Tweak performs an emotionally-charged song during a school assembly, in which he frantically warns of the growing tensions with North Korea, screaming at the apparent indifference of everyone. The boys urge his boyfriend, Craig Tucker, to calm Tweek's anxiety, but Tweek is further panicked by President Garrison's aggressive tweets to North Korea. Craig suggests sending cupcakes to North Korea to calm him down. Meanwhile, Eric Cartman and Heidi Turner have resumed dating after Cartman claims that Heidi was suicidal. However, Heidi gives Stan a voicemail by Cartman telling Heidi that he would commit suicide if she did not take him back. Heidi asks Stan to keep the voicemail secret but he shares it with the boys anyway. Cartman decides to raise awareness for his planned suicide but is told by PC Principal that the school is raising awareness for distracted drivers instead. Tweek is calmed to learn that Kim Jong-un enjoyed the cupcakes he sent him, but his anxiety returns when Garrison goads North Korea by claiming that Tweek likely defecated in the batter. Cartman performs a song at school to raise awareness of his plans to commit suicide, but a student is hit by a driver distracted by the President's tweets. Cartman and Heidi campaign to raise awareness for suicide outside a store, but Cartman keeps telling passersby that he will kill himself if they do not get others involved. Heidi realizes that he is only interested in participating in this activity in order to get attention for himself. North Korea fires a nuclear missile over Tweek's house, panicking Tweek further. Craig takes Tweek to an amusement park to calm him, but their whereabouts are tweeted by Garrison, leading to more vehicular fatalities and injuries by drivers distracted by Garrison's tweets. When Craig continues his efforts, Tweek angrily says that Craig's constant use of logic and geopolitical facts is not what he needs, which frustrates Craig himself. During lunch at school, a memorial service is announced for the students killed by distracted drivers, but Cartman interrupts this to announce a gathering for suicide awareness, saying he may commit suicide during it. Heidi tells Cartman to stop his selfish behavior, and when Cartman questions what the memorial service will solve, Heidi says that it does not aim to solve a problem, but that people in pain sometimes need help sorting out their emotions in order to properly express them, rather than quick answers. This prompts an epiphany for Craig, who rushes to Tweek's house. Instead of arguing with evidence or reasoning why his fears of North Korea are unfounded, he expresses sympathy for Tweek, who is then able to express that he feels scared, alone and powerless. Tweek's anxiety subsides, and he conceives an idea. At a school assembly, Tweek and Craig perform a song, \\"Put it Down\\", which urges people not to use their mobile devices if they are elected the President, prompting members of the public to pledge not to do so. Cartman interrupts the song, joyfully declaring that he will not kill himself. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode a 9.0 out of 10, saying \\"While this new season didn't start off on the right footing, it clearly didn't take long for the series to find its groove again. 'Put It Down' is a perfect example of how the show can juggle topical humor while still keeping the focus on the citizens of South Park.\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it an 8.0 out of 10, stating \\"After an average debut last week, 'Put It Down' was a great step in the right direction. It's an episode that could give you mixed feelings depending on your thoughts about suicide and suicide prevention, but by the end should make you appreciate what Matt and Trey were able to say and do.

The Mayu Frontier District () was a short-lived administrative zone of Burma (present-day Myanmar) which existed between 1961 and 1964. It covered the Maungdaw District of present-day Rakhine State in the historical region of Arakan. The zone was administered directly from the capital Rangoon (present- day Yangon). Geography The Mayu Frontier District was named after the Mayu River. It included Maungdaw Township, Buthidaung Township and a part of Rathedaung Township. The Mayu Range of mountains separated Maungdaw and Buthidaung. The Naf River estuary formed the northern boundary of the district, on the international border with East Pakistan. Background After the 1960 Burmese general election, Sultan Mahmud, the Burmese health minister, advocated a state for the Arakanese Indian community in the northern part of Arakan. Mahmud suggested the Kaladan River as the boundary between Muslim- majority and Buddhist-majority Arakan. Mahmud submitted his proposal to the Statehood Consultative Committee. Mahmud said that Arakanese Indians would accept a joint state with Arakanese Buddhists if there was adequate protection and representation of the Indian minority. If adequate safeguards were not possible, Mahmud proposed that a separate northern Arakan zone should be administered directly from the national capital Rangoon. On 1 May 1961,http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs14/Kei_Nemoto-Rohingya.pdf the Prime Minister of Burma U Nu implemented Mahmud's ideas, albeit the new zone did not extend up to the Kaladan River. Demographics The Mayu Frontier District had an Arakanese Indian majority, among whom most were Muslim. During this period, the term \\"Rohingya\\" was widely used to label the Indian community of Arakan, including in the speeches of Burmese leaders and on Burmese radio broadcasts. The term was popularized by M. A. Gaffar after he submitted a memorandum to the first Burmese government in 1949. Administration Between 1961 and 1962, the Mayu Frontier District was governed by the elected government in Rangoon. The 1962 Burmese coup d'√©tat ended Burmese parliamentary democracy. Following the coup, the Mayu Frontier District was directly administered by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) and the Union Revolutionary Council. Dissolution The Burmese military ended the special status of the district in February 1964. The Mayu Frontier area was placed under the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs. In 1974, when Burmese dictator Ne Win proclaimed the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma, the Mayu Frontier area was incorporated into Arakan State as the Maungdaw District.

CAR occupies a swath of ancient rocks, dating back billions of years that record significant aspects of Earth history and yield minerals vital to the country's small economy. Geologic history Southern CAR is part of the Congo Craton, a stable landmass dating to the Archean that was once fused with the Sao Francisco Craton until the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Some of the oldest rocks in CAR belong to the 3.4 billion year old Bomu Complex which includes migmatite gneiss and metasedimentary schist spanning from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Congo Craton once functioned as a small continent, until it was joined with Siberia during the formation of the supercontinent Columbia, between 2.1 and 1.8 billion years ago. A string of large igneous province (LIP) volcanic events took place in three pulses during the time that the craton was part of Columbia, until the supercontinent fragmented. The Congo Craton was subsequently joined to the supercontinent Rodinia between 1.3 billion and 750 million years ago after a period where it may have existed as a separate continent in the Southern Hemisphere. At the time, the continent was entirely barren with no land life and the region experienced large scale glaciation during the Cryogenian Period. The northern part of the country is grouped with the Saharan Metacraton, which began to form between 3 billion and 2 billion years ago and accelerated with the Pan-African Orogeny and the creation of the Oubangides Belt in the Neoproterozoic. After the breakup of Rodinia, modern CAR was situated near the center of the subsequent supercontinent Pannotia, as part of the fully assembled basement rock of the current African continent. The region existed in the Southern Hemisphere as part of the supercontinents Gondwana and Pangaea. Many aspects of Central African Republic's geologic history remain unknown. Along with the Brazilian state of Bahia, CAR is the only country known to host carbonados (black diamond aggregates), which some researchers have suggested may be connected to a Precambrian meteorite impact that could also have generated the Bangui magnetic anomaly. Bedrock geology Up to 60% of bedrock beneath the Central African Republic dates to the Precambrian. Much of the country is situated in the Archean Congo Craton. The North Equatorial Fold Belt, Pan-African granulites and greenstone belts are found in the north and center of the country. Cretaceous sandstones span the west and central areas of the republic. The Bakouma Formation includes extensive carbonates, glacial outwash and tillite deposits dated to the Neoproterozoic. Stratigraphically, the lower units of Precambrian rock are granite, amphibolite, gneiss and gneissic-migmatite rock, likely dating to the Neoarchean. These sequences, divided into the Bandas Belt and Dekoa Belt, are often described as a greenstone belt. Granitoid batholiths and dolerite dikes dating to the Proterozoic frequently intrude into these layers. The upper sequence is Neoproterozoic age quartzite and schist and tends to be folded, but only weakly metamorphosed. In the west, the Mambere Formation and the Kombele Formation in the east each record glacial sediments, while erosion and river activity left behind the Cretaceous Mouaka-Ouadda and Carnot-Berberati sandstone formations, as well as the plateaus of the Eocene Bambio Sandstone. During the Quaternary extensive weathering of surface rocks took place, up to 40 meters deep. Surficial geology and soils Iron-rich plinthosols dominate most of the center of the country. Unconsolidated psamment deposits (also known as arenosols) occupy a section of the west and center of the country along with soils grouped under the FAO ferralsol classification of iron and aluminium-rich soils. Hydric, grayish-blue wetland gleysols are found in small locations in the north and along the border with the Congo.

These effects are caused by accumulation of acetaldehyde, a major but toxic metabolite of alcohol formed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. The reaction has been variously termed a disulfiram-like reaction, alcohol intolerance, and acetaldehyde syndrome.Mutalik, M., & Sanghavi, D. (2014). Review of Drug Interactions: A Comprehensive Update. The prototypical drug of this group is disulfiram (brand name Antabuse), which acts as an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, preventing the metabolism of acetaldehyde into acetic acid, and is used in the treatment of alcoholism. A variety of other drugs cause disulfiram-like reactions upon consumption of alcohol as unintended drug interactions and side effects. Many disulfiram-like drugs act as inhibitors of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase similarly to disulfiram. However, some do not act via inhibition of this enzyme, and instead act via other, poorly elucidated mechanisms. Unlike acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors and other disulfiram- like drugs, alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors such as fomepizole (brand name Antizol) inhibit the metabolism of alcohol into acetaldehyde, thereby increasing and extending the effects of alcohol and reducing its toxicity. As such, they can be thought of as converses of disulfiram-like drugs. Fomepizole is used medically as an antidote against methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. List of agents Intended Drugs which cause disulfiram-like reactions upon ingestion of alcohol as an intended effect include: * Calcium carbimide * Disulfiram * Hydrogen cyanamide Unintended Drugs which cause disulfiram-like reactions upon ingestion of alcohol as an unintended effect include: * Abacavir * Cephalosporins such as cefamandole, cefmenoxime, cefmetazole, cefonicid, cefoperazone, cefotetan, and latamoxef (moxalactam); thought to be due to common N-methylthiotetrazole metabolite. * Chloral hydrate * Chloramphenicol * Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) * Ethacrynic acid * Griseofulvin * Hydrazines such as isoniazid and procarbazine * Ketoconazole * Macrolide immunosuppressants such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus * Mepacrine (quinacrine) * Metronidazole * Nilutamide * Nitrovasodilators (nitrates) such as nitroglycerin * Nitrofurans such as furazolidone and nitrofurantoin * Nitroimidazoles such as benznidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, and tinidazole * Pargyline * Phenacetin * Phentolamine * Phenylbutazone * Procarbazine * Propranolol * Sulfiram * Sulfonamides * Sulfonylureas such as chlorpropamide, glibenclamide (glyburide), and tolbutamide * Tolazoline Natural Natural compounds and species which have been found to cause disulfiram-like reactions upon ingestion of alcohol include: * Coprine, via active metabolite 1-aminocyclopropanol; found in mushrooms such as Ampulloclitocybe clavipes (club-footed clitocybe), Coprinus atramentarius (common inkcap), and Imperator torosus (brawny bolete) among others *Kudzu (Pueraria lobata) * Coprinopsis atramentaria See also * Alcohol intolerance References Alcohol Alcohol abuse ","title":"Disulfiram-like drug"},{"id":"55272734","text":"The 1988 presidential campaign of David Duke, Grand Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan and notable perennial candidate, was formally launched on June 8, 1987, as Duke announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency of the United States in the 1988 presidential election.

Duke had attempted to announce his campaign at two Atlanta hotels, but his reservation at both were cancelled as they stated that his appearance posed a threat to their safety. His candidacy was attacked with Paul G. Kirk, the Democratic National Committee Chairman, stating that Duke's attempt at the party's nomination was \\"fraud on the process and the public\\" and that they would attempt to prevent him from gaining primary ballot access. Kirk compared Duke's candidacy to that of Lyndon LaRouche's many attempts at the Democratic nomination and how the Democratic Party had fought against him as well. 1988 Democratic Primaries Shortly after his announcement Duke appeared on an Atlanta WSGT radio station which caused multiple protests around the station and call-ins meant to disrupt the radio station. A week later he pled no contest to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of a roadway from when he was involved in an incident during a civil rights march in Forsyth County in January. Duke was excluded from all of the primary debates and he filed an $1 million lawsuit against the Democratic Party for not allowing him to participate at the November 2, 1987, debate at Tulane University stating that his right to freedom of speech was violated, but it was dismissed by a New Orleans federal judge in March 1988. Duke, a white supremacist, hated the black civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and his \\"Rainbow Coalition\\" and he claimed to command his \\"Sunshine Coalition\\" in opposition. Duke lost in his home state of Louisiana to Jesse Jackson where he only received 4% of the vote, but Duke managed to win the 1988 New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary in a landslide with 10,531 votes for 99.69% of the vote. After failing to gain any traction in the Democratic primaries he dropped out and became the presidential candidate for the Populist Party. Populist Party On March 7, 1987, David Duke gave his speech at the Populist Party National Committee in Sewickly, Pennsylvania, in which he said \\"This was the largest pro-white demonstration I\`ve ever seen,\\" in regards to the 3,000 people there and \\"There are going to be tremendous opportunities to take this country back for the founding majority\\". On March 13 the Populist Party gave Duke its presidential nomination with Bo Gritz as his vice presidential running mate although he would later withdraw stating that he had been told that Representative James Traficant had been given the presidential nomination. Duke had managed to take the nomination due to the Populist Party's financial and organizational failures at the time which caused him to run unopposed after all of his opponents had already stopped running. On September 27, 1988, he was removed from a Paramus restaurant by its owner after making an unannounced campaign event where he was to debate a Libertarian party member at it after another restaurant cancelled his event after learning about him. In the majority of the states he appeared on the ballot with Floyd Parker, while in other states it was Trenton Stokes and received 47,047 votes, for 0.04 percent of the national popular vote with his best showing being in his home state of Louisiana where he won 1% of the vote. Popular culture In the television series Parks and Recreation episode \\"Practice Date,\\" it is revealed that character Donna Meagle donated to Duke's 1988 campaign after receiving a phone call from the campaign, which told her that Duke planned to lower taxes. The 2018 film BlacKKKlansman stars a fictional David Duke organizing events and makes various references to his presidential run.

Background The first submarine ordered by Romania was part of the 1912 naval program. She was ordered from Italy, along with the four Vifor-class destroyers, however she was requisitioned by the Italian authorities in 1914 and never delivered to Romania.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 421Axworthy, Mark; Scafe»ô, Cornel; CrƒÉciunoiu, Cristian (1995).

Her first mission took place during the 1944 evacuation of the Crimea, between 20 April and 15 May. Initially, she was only tasked with patrolling the Turkish coast, but on 30 April, she was tasked with the surveillance of the Soviet port of Batumi. The information on Soviet naval movements she transmitted during her mission proved to be very useful to the German and Romanian ships which were carrying out the evacuation of Sevastopol. Her second and last mission consisted in a patrol off the Soviet port of Novorossyisk, between 15 June and 27 July. She was heavily pursued and hunted by Soviet forces, but just like her sister, she managed to return to Constan»õa without any losses. This was the last Romanian submarine patrol of the war, and with a length of over 40 days, the longest in Romanian submarine history.Antony Preston, Warship 2001-2002, Conway Maritime Press, 2001, pp. 83-84Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, Glorie »ôi dramƒÉ: Marina RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1940-1945, Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, pp. 165-166 CB-class midget submarines The Italian Black Sea midget submarines under Romanian control, late 1943 The submarines were designed and built by Caproni. They were used as coastal defence units, being a significant improvement of the previous CA- class. Each unit had a standard (surfaced) displacement of 35.4 tons and a submerged displacement of 44.3 tons. They measured 15 meters in length, had a beam of 3 meters and a draught of 2.05 meters. Power plant consisted of one Isotta Fraschini diesel engine and one Brown Boveri electric motor, both generating a total of 130 hp powering a single shaft, resulting in a surfaced top speed on 7.5 knots and a submerged top speed of 7 knots. Each boat was armed with two externally-mounted 450 mm torpedoes, each tube could be reloaded without removing the vessel from water. The two torpedoes could also be replaced by two mines. Each boat had a crew of four, aided in navigation by a small conning tower.Walter S.

They departed on 25 April 1942 and reached the Romanian port of Constan»õa on 2 May. They formed the 1st Squadriglia Sommergibili CB, under the overall command of Francesco Mimbelli.

Sabahan cuisine is a regional cuisine of Malaysia. As in the rest of Malaysian cuisine, Sabah food is based on staples such as rice with a great variety of other ingredients and different methods of food preparations due to the influence of the state's varied geography and indigenous cultures that were quite distinct from the regional cuisines of the Peninsular Malaysia. Sabah along with its neighbour of Sarawak is famous for their multi-ethnic population.  Dishes  Amplang. Among the foods and beverages particular to Sabah are: * Amplang is a type of cracker made from Spanish mackerel, tapioca starch and other seasonings, and then deep fried. * Beaufort mee () is a speciality of Beaufort town.

Smoked and pulverised buah keluak (nuts from the Kepayang tree (Pangium edule) which grows in Malaysia's mangrove swamplands), or pangi is a key ingredient and acts as a preservative. Combined with rice, salt and fresh meat or fish, the mixture is then placed into a sealed jar or container for fermentation. Contemporary variants for bosou add bananas and pineapples to the mixture. Pinongian is a variant where rice is omitted to produce a final product which is much less tangy in taste; however, unlike bosou, \\"pinongian\\" must be cooked before serving. * Century egg dumpling () is a speciality of Sandakan town. The dumpling is added with a cutlet of century egg & may be served along with noodles. *Fried pork () is a speciality of Sandakan town.

The project uses an Archimedes Screw in a reverse direction to generate electricity and was funded by people in the community. Around of water pass along the screw per second, which generates enough electricity to power 45-48 homes. History Esk Energy (Yorkshire) was formed as an industrial and provident society in 2008 to explore the idea behind a green energy scheme in Eskdale. Initially, windpower was researched but it was decided that a wind turbine would be visually intrusive in the North York Moors National Park. After a river survey and an approval was made by the Environment Agency, the collective pressed ahead with the hydro scheme. Provisional planning for the scheme was given the go-ahead in October 2009 and a co-operative was formed to raise the capital needed for the project. The money raising culminated in a share option to raise extra funding of the ¬£450,000 that was required for the scheme. With the funding secured, construction started in May 2012 with the plant being commissioned into service on 12 December 2012. The Archimedes Screw that was built for the scheme arrived on site in September 2012 and was installed by October of the same year. The screw is wide, long and will allow a maximum of water to pass through a second. The screw is wide enough to allow fish to move through downstream without coming to harm. At the same time that the project was being built, the North Yorks Moors Park Authority re-built the fishpass adjacent to the turbine. The screw generates up 160,000 Kilo-watt hours per year which is enough electricity to power 45-48 homes, and reduces carbon emissions by up to per year. Even though the National Park Authority was satisfied that the development would have no detriment to the ecology or hydrology to the river, some in the community were upset that they were not fully informed as to the prospect and possible ramifications of the hydro scheme. Parts of the local community were unaware that when the river was in low flow, the water would not go through the screw, but go over the weir or through the fish pass as normal, as they claim, this had not been communicated to them.

In an interview to Doordarshan, he informs that he was the first of his family to pass 5th standard and thus the environment was not academically inclined. On his failure in high school, his teacher Pundit Ratanlal Shastri, urged him to study one chapter of the Bhagavad Gita every day, which would ensure god's benevolence and thus put an end to all his troubles. This exposure to the Bhagwad Gita, instilled in him a sense of curiosity about the secrets in the text, and the desire to share them with others. This desire led him to attempt to excel in Sanskrit, without which he couldn't see fruition of his goal of unravelling Bhagwad Gita's secrets.

The novel is considered an outstanding work in modern Sinhalese fiction due to the significance of its theme and the sophistication of its technique. The story is based on a virtuous character called Aravinda, a Sinhalese youth raised in a traditional Buddhist family in the South. First published in 1956 in Sinhala, the novel was translated into English language in 1985 by Professor Ashley Halpe, under the title The Way of the Lotus. It was later translated into the Tamil language in 1992 and French in 1995. Viragaya is considered as the first Sinhala novel which was completely translated and published in the French language. The novel was made into a movie in 1987 by Tissa Abeysekera. Viragaya is considered one of the best novels of the writer. It exhibits the influences of Existentialism on Wickramasinghe specially through the character of Lokusuriya, the retired postmaster. Sarojini, Menaka, Bathee, Siridasa are the other prominent characters in the novel. The novel is presented through Sammy, a friend of Aravinda's cousin Siridasa. The narration resembles that of Lockwood in Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights. Plot The novel starts with Sammy, a common friend of Aravinda Jayasena and Siridasa Jayasena, visiting Siridasa. Siridasa and his wife, Sarojini welcome Sammy and relays him the news of Aravinda's death. Sammy is interested in mysticism and occulticism which compelled him to travel India. He shares Aravinda's passion of metaphysics, ancient lore and alchemy. Sammy is grief stricken to hear the death of Aravinda at a relatively young age. Siridasa tells him of the final days of Aravinda and gives him a book which appeared to be the Aravinda's diary. The narration then shifts to first person and the reader meets Aravinda. Aravinda starts his story with a special introduction of his father who works as a local physician (Veda Mahattaya) to make the ends meet. Commonly known as Jayasena Veda Mahattaya, Aravinda's father is sought after by villagers when someone is ill. He visits them and treat them with traditional ayurvedic medication which he makes a servant produce at his own house. Aravinda then recalls Sarojini, a classmate of Aravinda and a daughter of a wealthy merchant. Sarojini expresses her interest in Aravinda and two enjoy each other's company. Aravinda's elder sister Menaka is married to Dharmadasa. Aravinda is forced to take biology to be a doctor but he declines to be one and becomes a government clerk. Meannwhile Sarojini proposes him to elope and start a family, but Aravainda does not accept the proposal. Grief stricken Sarojini agrees with her parents to marry Siridasa, Aravinda's cousin.Aravinda's father dies and his mother finds out that her husband has mortgaged the house to Dharmadasa for three thousand rupees. Frustrated mother leaves the house despite her daughter's pleas that she and Aravinda can stay at their home until they die. Aftet the departure of mother, Menaka and Dharamada move house to Aravinda's place. Aravinds pursues his career at the government office. One day, he accidentally makes an explosion in his own room while trying new chemical experiments. Realising that he is a threat to his own nephew, Sirimal, Menaka and Dharmada's son, he decides to leave the house and to rent a place. He employs Gunawathi as housemaid who has a ten year old girl named Bathee with whom Aravinda builds up a father-daughter relationship. Aravinda gives her a school education despite the criticisms of his elder sister Menaka. Kulasuriya,a retired postmaster who wanders in the village aimlessly encourages Aravinda's existentialist ideology and they enjoy each other's company. Now Bathee is grown up and she is in love with a driver named Jinadasa. Aravinda is jealous and worried to see that Bathee'a attention is completely diverted to Jinadasa. Aravinda asks Jinadasa to meet him and buys him a used car and marries him off to Bathee. After their marriage, Aravinda falls ill and Jinadasa and Bathee come to nurse him. Sarojini comes to visit Aravinda and he admits that he had both loved and not loved Sarojini and Bathee. Aravinda's illness worsened and he ponders his own life. Aravinda makes peace with himself and he is detached from all the worldly relationships drawing the title of the novel Viragaya (detachment). Aravinda passes away and people come in numbers to pay last tribute to Aravinda; the writer alludes that the villagers have intuitively understood Aravinda's good qualities even though he is ridiculed and criticised by the middle class in society.

She is pictured in many of his paintings over very many years, most famously in the early 1880s Luncheon of the Boating Party (where she is the woman on the left with the little dog), and Blonde Bather. They had three children together, two of whom, Pierre and Jean, went on to have distinguished careers in film, and the third, Claude, became a ceramic artist. Pierre had a son Claude who became the well-known cinematographer. She predeceased her elderly husband. Biography Aline Victorine Charigot was born on 23 May 1859 to a farming family who cultivated grapes in Essoyes in the department of Aube, France. When she was still a baby her father went to America and her mother moved away leaving Aline to be looked after by her aunt and uncle. She received little education. In 1874 she followed her mother to Montmartre, Paris, where she worked as a dressmaker. In about 1880 she met Auguste Renoir, when she was twenty and he nearly forty, and started modelling for him. She gave birth to their first son, Pierre, in 1885 and they married in Paris on 14 April 1890. They had two other sons, Jean born 1894 and Claude born 1901. From 1888 the couple spent progressively more time living in Essoyes, buying a house there in 1896. In 1903 they moved to Cagnes-sur-Mer, building a new house there, Les Collettes, between 1905 and 1909. Pierre became a prominent stage and film actor; Jean became a famous film auteur, actor, and author; and Claude became a ceramic artist. Pierre had a son Claude (Aline and Auguste's grandson) who became the well-known cinematographer. After Claude's birth she developed diabetes but hid this from her husband. Pierre and Jean were drafted into the army in World War I and both were injured, Jean badly so. Aline died from a heart attack in Nice on 27 June 1915 after a hospital visit to Jean so predeceasing her elderly and disabled husband by four years. She was buried in the south of France and then her remains were moved to Essoyes to be alongside her mother. Personality By the Seashore, 1883 Charigot had a love of the arts ‚Äì she played the piano and decorated her bedroom with paintings by Johan Jongkind. According to Ambroise Vollard, in 1907 she designed and managed the building of the Renoirs' new villa at Cagnes-sur-Mer. She took care of her children as they grew up and supervised their various nannies and maids, notable amongst whom was her cousin Gabrielle Renard. This became very important as Renoir's rheumatoid arthritis became severe as he aged. She was blonde and had become comfortably plump from quite a young age. Renoir's biographer, Barbara White, describes the appearance of the model in the 1881 Blonde Bather as \\"rotund\\" and the 1885 and 1886 portraits being of a curvaceous woman. Modelling Charigot modelled for Renoir's paintings, sculptures and drawings over a long period from 1880 to 1915. She only sat for three portraits by her husband but she appeared in many of his subject paintings. In the 1880s she was Renoir's main model for the period in which he changed his manner of figure painting towards an \\"Ingresque\\" style. After her death Renoir made a terracotta sculpture of Aline as a maquette for a monument for her grave. Because of his arthritis he supervised the sculptor Richard Guino in doing the modelling, based in his 1885 painting of her nursing their first child (see below). The monument was never created but the work was used as a basis for a bronze bust placed by her grave. Gallery This list includes Renoir's main works of or including Aline Charigot. Some paintings have been done in several similar versions ‚Äì in these cases a representative one has been chosen.

He created original and derivative video games, devices and phenomena in Minecraft, without using Minecraft mods. He created an interpreter for the programming language BASIC and an emulator for the 1977 home video game console Atari 2600 in Minecraft. In addition to Minecraft builds that run without mods, he created plugins for the game. SethBling wrote artificial intelligence programs that play Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Kart. He held a world record of 41.35 seconds for Super Mario World until june 2020 and a former world record for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He achieved the world record for Super Mario World by using a glitch that enabled him to execute arbitrary code and skip to the game's credits. In 2015, he was the first to do so on a home video game console. He injected code to play a Flappy Bird-like game within Super Mario World on a stock Super Nintendo Entertainment System. He was the first to perform this kind of arbitrary code execution by hand. In 2017, Cooper Harasyn and SethBling created a jailbreak by hand using exploits to save a hex editor onto a read-only memory cartridge, allowing for creation of mods.  Early life  SethBling was raised Jewish, but has since become an atheist. He decided that he was an atheist sometime around when he was in elementary school, but \\"played along\\" through high school. SethBling's nickname is derived from his AIM screen name in high school. According to SethBling, his combined SAT score was 1470 out of 1600. SethBling started out programming his calculator in middle school and wrote \\"lots of\\" games throughout high school, including an MUD. SethBling wrote in 2012 that C# was his favorite programming language. SethBling worked as a software engineer at Microsoft for three years, where he worked on Xbox, and for four months on Bing. SethBling said that his work at Xbox had not been related to video games, and that he had worked on the Xbox version of Internet Explorer, and on Xbox SmartGlass, a mobile phone app for remotely controlling an Xbox console.  Video games  SethBling played Super Mario Bros. 3 when he was five or six. Super Mario World was \\"one of the hot games\\" of his childhood.:67 SethBling had the Sega Genesis home video game console, and played a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog on it.:68 SethBling started playing Minecraft around September 2010, after college, after his roommate told him about it. The sandbox aspect was \\"very appealing\\" to SethBling, as he played MUDs in middle school and high school. SethBling thought the game was \\"really cool\\" and played it for about a month, after which he was \\"done with this game\\". A few months later, he bought a new computer and decided to play Minecraft again. SethBling got into the technical community and was quick to discover redstone, a programmable resource in Minecraft, and began uploading videos of his creations to YouTube weeks later. SethBling was inspired to use redstone in Minecraft because he wanted to build a minecart station. Inspired by other YouTube videos about Minecraft, SethBling created his first few videos to \\"better get [his] money's worth\\" from the screen recording utility Fraps he bought. SethBling initially uploaded videos on YouTube in order to share his creations on Reddit. He did not expect to gain subscribers as a small channel with only a few videos. SethBling's YouTube channel greatly increased in popularity when Minecraft creator Markus Persson shared one of SethBling's videos on Twitter. According to SethBling, he \\"almost never\\" played on consoles despite working at Xbox. Working at Microsoft, SethBling would spend almost all his free evenings and weekends playing Minecraft. SethBling quit his job at Microsoft around April 2012 because of his YouTube channel's success and has been independent since.:65  Minecraft career  Unless stated otherwise, all Minecraft builds mentioned in this section run on unmodded Minecraft, except modified block textures.  2011‚Äì2012  In 2011, SethBling recreated Duck Hunt using freshly introduced bow-charging mechanics in Minecraft. Engadget Jordan Mallory wrote that SethBling's replica \\"[manages] to capture the innocence and nostalgia of our 8-bit youths\\". In February 2012, SethBling recreated the 1964 toy Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, which consists of a red and a blue robot, within Minecraft. Mike Fahey of Kotaku praised the mechanics and described the robots as \\"movable though somewhat janky\\". In March 2012, FVDisco and SethBling created Super Pirate Battle Royale, a Minecraft minigame for two teams where the goal is to sink the other team's ship using TNT. Also in 2012, SethBling created SkyGrid, a Minecraft map consisting of blocks only on every fourth coordinate in each axis. In September 2012, SethBling and survival map maker Hypixel, the creator of the popular server Hypixel, recreated gameplay, maps, and the eight player classes from the first-person shooter (FPS) Team Fortress 2, within Minecraft. Each player class has its own perks, and can be changed during the game. Minecraft creator Markus Persson called the recreations \\"the most fun and impressive\\" in a 2013 interview with CNET.  2013‚Äì2014  In February 2013, SethBling made a mechanical bull in Minecraft. Also in February, SethBling recreated the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong and its introductory cutscene in Minecraft. In the original Donkey Kong, players have to avoid falling barrels, but in SethBling's version, they have to avoid minecarts. Three months later, SethBling created an air hockey minigame for two players in Minecraft. It consists of a rink and an endlessly sliding object made of many minecarts. SethBling's minigames have been featured on Minecraft Realms. One of them is Blocks vs. Zombies, a 2013 co-op tower defense minigame in which players shoot arrows to defeat incoming zombies in a trench. As players gain killstreaks, they may purchase upgraded weapons, arrow-shooting towers, barriers and traps for zombies. The game ends when a zombie pushes another zombie over the front edge of the field. Julian Benson of PCGamesN said that the minigame takes the \\"stronghold mentality\\" of Plants vs. Zombies, the traps of Orcs Must Die!, and the upgrade system of the FPS Killing Floor. SethBling recreated the incremental game Cookie Clicker, released earlier in 2013. In 2014, SethBling recreated the sandbox video game Goat Simulator and the puzzle game Bejeweled in Minecraft. SethBling also recreated a spinning Stargate, a moving sand wave and the Microsoft Office assistant Clippy. In early 2014, SethBling wrote a pickpocketing plugin for Bukkit called BlingPickpocket. In May 2014, SethBling created a Minecraft portal which renders a portion of the other dimension behind it. In late 2014, SethBling and Minecraft YouTuber Cubehamster created a minigame called Missile Wars where players from two teams spawn missiles to break through the opposite team's wall. The idea came from having a fight between two Cubehamster's Mega Gargantuas, giant robots with cannons and \\"missile launchers\\". The robots could shoot flame arrows, launch TNT blocks and shoot down incoming missiles. After the Mega Gargantua fight, Cubehamster wanted them to \\"turn [it] into a game which focuses on firing missiles at each other and trying to blow them up\\". In Missile Wars, players receive items which they can use to spawn missiles, and blow up, stop and defuse incoming missiles. Players can jump on missiles and ride them across the playfield. Cubehamster said that \\"subtle techniques\\" involving missile mechanics had made the game popular. According to Cubehamster, Missile Wars was built in two weeks and thoroughly tested afterwards. The game was featured on Minecraft Realms. As a nod to Microsoft's 2014 acquisition of Mojang, SethBling recreated basic functionality of Minecraft in Microsoft Excel, which included navigation and crafting.  2015‚Äì2016  A match being played of SethBling's recreation of Splatoon within Minecraft. In 2015, SethBling created a Minecraft version of Splatoon Turf Wars mode. The Splatoon minigame is similar to the Wii U game, in that two teams of up to four players compete to paint as much of the ground and walls as possible in three minutes. SethBling got help from PyroPuncher because he had never played Splatoon on console. The Minecraft version features three of Splatoon main weapons. In 2015, SethBling worked with Verizon to create a web browser and to introduce text messaging and video calling functionality to Minecraft. In 2016, SethBling made an interpreter for the programming language BASIC in Minecraft. Programming many Minecraft command blocks to run the interpreter took him two weeks. The interpreter is slow and its speed declines with continued use; that is because Minecraft has a clock rate of 20 ticks per second. For example, printing a single character with the interpreter takes 20 seconds. The build features a virtual keyboard; a whiteboard, which displays the code; and a programmable turtle, which can mine and place blocks. In late 2016, SethBling built an emulator for the 1977 home video game console, Atari 2600, in Minecraft. The emulator has 64 kB of functional random-access memory (RAM) which can be edited on the fly, and a functional 8-bit microprocessor based on the MOS Technology 6502; it also has functional and importable read-only memory (ROM). SethBling had the emulator run the original Atari 2600 read-only memory cartridges for the games Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Donkey Kong. The ROM cartridge contains four kilobytes of data; each bit of RAM and ROM is represented by a Minecraft block. More than two thousand command blocks comprise the emulator's processor. The emulator is slow: the Assembly-based processor can complete only 20 instructions per second; in contrast, Atari's processor can execute 510,000 instructions per second (0.51 MIPS). While the Atari 2600 renders graphics at 60 frames , SethBling's emulator renders graphics at 60 frames on a virtual screen. The emulator does not have a controller, so games cannot be played on it. SethBling created a resource pack for Minecraft Pocket Edition Alpha, which was released in October 2016. The \\"Add-On\\" was titled Castle Siege Battle and was criticized by Kotaku Robert Gurthrie for causing glitches.  2018‚Äìpresent  In January 2019, SethBling sped up the Atari 2600 emulator to a rendering speed of one frame per second. It then took him around fifteen minutes to \\"technically\\" tie the world record of 5.57 seconds for the racing video game Dragster. In June 2019 Sethbling released his 1000th video on his YouTube Channel in which he showcased a genetic evolution simulator datapack.  Super Mario career   Speedrunning  Until June 2020, SethBling held the world record of 41.35 seconds for the Credits Warp Any% speedrun category of Super Mario World. Players can use glitches to modify the game's RAM values, allowing them to write assembly code. When executed via arbitrary code execution, the code allows players to skip directly from the first level to the credits without having to defeat the game's boss. In 2015, SethBling was the first to execute the Credits Warp glitch on a home video game console, with a time of five minutes and 59 seconds, after Twitch streamer JeffW356 had successfully executed the glitch on an emulator. SethBling executed the glitch for the first time on console minutes after a Super Mario World world record was set without using arbitrary code execution. By successfully executing the glitch on a Super Nintendo console, SethBling validated the faster, emulator run by JeffW356. SethBling used four controllers via two Super Multitap devices to finish the game in under one minute. He left specific buttons on the controllers pushed down to manipulate memory bytes and write certain code. In the game, SethBling executed certain actions and pixel-precise moves like duplicating Yoshi blocks and launching a red shell at a specific pixel. SethBling holds a former world record for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild without use of in-game unlockable bonuses enabled by Amiibo figurines, saying in 2017 that using the unlockables is \\"seen by casual audience members as 'cheating', but they also currently don't affect the run that much.\\" In 2017, SethBling told Kotaku, \\"When I touch a game, I want to understand it.\\"  Neural networks  In June 2015, SethBling wrote an artificial intelligence (AI) program called MarI/O that plays Super Mario World. The program is based on neuroevolution of augmenting topologies; thus, it generates neural networks using genetic algorithms. MarI/O is only given the level layout and the positions of obstacles, and is incentivized to emulate the fitness function moving as far to the right as possible, and as fast as possible. MarI/O tries 300 genomes per evolutionary generation, separated into species. Each genome produces a neural network, and only the most fit genomes are bred into the next generation. SethBling ran the program, and after 34 generations, which lasted 24 hours, MarI/O finished a level by spin-jumping through the entire level and avoiding all power-ups and enemies. MarI/O displays a graphical rendering of its underlying structure. A week later SethBling trained MarI/O to play Super Mario Bros. The program was not able to complete the first level of Super Mario Bros. because of complicated spatial movements required to jump over obstacles. MarI/O continuously played Super Mario Bros. for over 17 days. In November 2017, SethBling built a recurrent neural network to play Super Mario Kart. He trained the program, MariFlow, with video footage in which he plays Super Mario Kart so that the program learns how to recover from dead-end situations. The video footage used for training MariFlow contains interactive sessions in which SethBling occasionally takes control of the character. MariFlow's goal is to emulate the video footage as closely as possible during gameplay.  Other ventures  In Flappy Bird, the player controls a bird which has to jump between vertically aligned pipes. Here, SethBling controls Mario, and the number of pipes he has passed through successfully is displayed in the upper-left corner. The pipe texture is from Super Mario World and Mario's animation is the swimming animation from the game. In March 2016, SethBling injected Flappy Bird-like code written by p4plus2 into unmodified Super Mario World RAM on a stock Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a stock cartridge, in under an hour. SethBling first extended the level timer and used a power-up incrementation glitch to allow external code to run. He added code to display Mario's x-coordinate which acted as memory locations in the code he was writing. SethBling then created a bootloader to be able to launch the Flappy Bird-like code that he would later write into unused memory with precise Mario movements and spin-jumping. SethBling used two Super Multitap devices in order to use multiple controllers, which had several buttons pressed down. The arbitrary code execution setup that SethBling used was discovered by MrCheeze. Super Mario World had been modified to emulate other games before by automatically feeding pre-recorded controller input into the console via a computer, but SethBling was the first to do it exclusively by hand. SethBling and Cooper Harasyn placed a full hex editor and gameplay mods onto a stock Super Mario World cartridge in May 2017, only using standard controller inputs. Harasyn discovered an exploit that lets a player write data to 256-byte save files that are permanently stored on a Super Mario World cartridge. The data can be arranged so that the game is jailbroken every time it starts up. Harasyn and SethBling used the exploit to create a compact, on- screen hex editor, loadable from a save file. A player can edit the system RAM through the hex editor to alter the game state. In-game mods, such as support for the SNES Mouse and giving Mario telekinesis powers, can be written to a save file using the hex editor. On 5 December 2015, SethBling acted as a coach in \\"Clash of Karts: Mario Kart 8\\", a one-hour eSports special on Disney XD.

Schultz was carrying a multitool and walked towards the police, asking them to shoot. The incident was followed by protests and civil unrest, which led to multiple arrests. Schultz's parents filed a wrongful death suit. The shooting was investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. In March 2020, it was announced that Tyler Beck would not face charges. Background Scout Schultz was born in Rockville, Maryland in 1995. Schultz was born with hypospadias. The Schultz family later moved to Lilburn, Georgia. Schultz was a fourth year computer engineering major at Georgia Institute of Technology, and expected to graduate a semester early according to their father. Schultz was bisexual, nonbinary and intersex and used singular they pronouns. They were the president of Pride Alliance on campus. Schultz, who suffered from clinical depression, had spent time in counseling after attempting suicide by hanging in 2015. Shooting Schultz, a 21-year-old student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, called 9-1-1 on September 16, 2017, around 11:17 p.m. Schultz said there was a suspicious person on campus with a knife and possibly a gun. Schultz gave a description matching Schultz's own appearance, saying that the person had long blond hair, a white t-shirt, and blue jeans, and said that the person might be intoxicated. Four police officers approached Schultz outside a dormitory on campus. Schultz had a multitool, which included a small knife, but no gun. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the multitool's blade was not extended. Schultz refused to drop the multitool and walked towards the police, with arms hanging down, while shouting \\"shoot me!\\" Schultz was shot and shortly after was pronounced dead at the Grady Memorial Hospital. The incident was captured on a cell-phone video. Three suicide notes were found in Schultz's dorm room. The police officer who shot Schultz was identified as Tyler Beck. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \\"Beck was certified by the Georgia Peace Officer and Standards Training Council (POST) but had not undergone Crisis Intervention Training, which trains police on how to handle mentally ill suspects.\\" Shortly after the shooting, Beck was put on paid leave. Aftermath and reactions Schultz's family attorney, Chris Stewart, said the police overreacted. Stewart said the idea that the death was a \\"suicide by cop\\" did not justify what happened. He also said, \\"The area was secured. There was no one around at risk.\\" Schultz's mother, Lynne Schultz, suggested the police should have used pepper spray or Tasers instead of gunning them down. (According to a spokesman, Georgia Tech police are equipped with the former but not the latter.) Scout's father, William Schultz, said at a news conference, \\"Why did you have to shoot? That's the only question that matters right now. Why did you kill my son?\\" G. P. \\"Bud\\" Peterson, the president of Georgia Tech, said the shooting was a \\"heart-wrenchingly painful time\\" for the university. Despite Schultz not finishing senior year, Georgia Tech awarded them a diploma. The shooting was investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. In September 2018, with the investigation still on- going, the parents announced that they had grown frustrated with the lack of criminal charges.Lauren Pozen, Family of tech student killed by campus police to sue university , Wsbtv.com, 19 September 2018 Schultz's parents filed a wrongful death suit naming the university, Tyler Beck, and the Georgia Board of Regents in September 2019.

Vigil and protest  A peaceful vigil for Schultz was held on campus on September 18. Twenty minutes later, about 50 protesters marched through campus while carrying a banner which read \\"Protect LGBTQ\\" and chanting \\"Justice Now\\". The protest turned violent and a police car was set on fire. Three people were arrested, one of them a Georgia Tech student. They were charged with \\"inciting a riot and battery of an officer.\\" In the following weeks three more people were arrested for \\"misdemeanor obstruction of law enforcement.\\" Schultz's parents appealed for calm.

Background The 24 songs in Swedish were composed between 1943 and 1945. At this time, Pettersson was violist at the Stockholm Concert Society. The text of the songs was written by Pettersson himself and is partly autobiographical. The main topic of the song cycle is his youth in poverty. The songs were kept simple, but the text is not easy to understand and uses a highly poetic and cryptic language. Pettersson wrote over 100 poems, but only 24 were set to music. The Swedish Broadcasting Corporation and his publisher Nordiska Musikf√∂rlaget initially refused to publish the songs. The cycle was first published in 1976. Musicologist Andreas Krause has posited that the name Barefoot Songs is a reminiscence and tribute to Schubert's Winterreise. \\"Barefoot on the ice\\" is a quotation from the 24th and last song '.

Early life Frederick ('Freddie') Delve was born in Brighton, the son of a tailor, and joined the Royal Navy on his 16th birthday in 1918, working as a wireless telegraphist in the Black Sea, an experience which spawned his enthusiasm for modern telecommunications. In 1922 Delve he left the Navy and joined the Brighton Fire Brigade. Fire service By 1929, aged 27, he had been promoted to the rank of Second Officer, the youngest in Britain. In 1934, he moved to the Croydon Fire Brigade as Chief Officer, leading its installation of radio telecommunications between all fire appliances and headquarters, and supervising the brigade's deployment at the fire which destroyed the Crystal Palace in Sydenham in November 1936. In 1937, with World War II looming, Delve served on a Home Office committee advising on changes to Britain's fire service. Its recommendations were implemented following the Fire Brigades Act 1938, which established the Auxiliary Fire Service and admitted women to fire brigades. During the war he was appointed Deputy Inspector-in-Chief of Fire Services, advising on fire support needs and helping to establish the National Fire Service in 1941 (in January 1941, he was awarded the King's Police and Fire Services Medal, 'for gallantry'). He was then appointed Chief Officer of No 5 Region (covering the London area), in which role he extended use of radio communications in fire vessels along the River Thames, and was also an adviser on fire bombing. Chief officer of London Fire Brigade After the war, Delve was appointed Chief Officer of the reconstituted London Fire Brigade in 1948. Challenges included provision of fire services to tower blocks and to traffic accidents, and the movement of hazardous materials across the capital (in 1958, Delve produced a report, Fireman's Handbook of Hazardous Industries, published by London County Council). Under his leadership, street-based fire alarms were replaced by the '999' system (first introduced in central London in 1937), fire appliances were modernised and fire stations rebuilt. Major fires in Covent Garden market (1949 and 1954), the Goodge Street deep tunnels (1956), and Smithfield meat market basement (1958 - during which two firemen died) led to changes in procedures relating to breathing apparatus. Delve and his deputy and successor, Leslie Leete, proposed control procedures that eventually became national policy, and also recommended the fitting of warning devices to breathing apparatus so that users were alerted when their oxygen supplies were running low. Having been awarded CBE in 1942, Delve was the first LFB chief to be knighted in office, in the 1962 Birthday Honours. After his 1962 retirement, he joined the board of Securicor.

Kozelek and Yeaton met at a Dutch festival in summer 2016, and recorded and self-produced Yellow Kitchen from December 2016 to May 2017 in the United States. Guest appearances on the album include Steve Shelley and Jim White on drums and Holly Throsby and Will Oldham (Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy) on vocals. The album develops upon Kozelek's spoken word, stream of consciousness lyrical and vocal approach. Autobiographical in nature, Kozelek comments on his personal life and current affairs among other subjects. The music, largely provided by Yeaton, is experimental and ambient, displaying occasional dissonance as well as influences from minimalism. Different musical directions are explored within individual tracks in addition to across the album. Upon its release in 2017, where it became Kozelek's third album and fourth release overall that year, Yellow Kitchen received both positive and mixed views from professional music critics, with some journalists opining that the recording was one of Kozelek's most abstract releases yet. Recording While Mark Kozelek won critical acclaim with his band Sun Kil Moon's sixth album Benji (2014), on his subsequent projects, he moved towards a more eosteric and \\"almost Knausg√•rdian [lyrical and vocal] style, including long, detailed, half-sung, half-spoken descriptions of everything that he did and thought in a given span.\\" Kozelek met Parquet Courts bassist and electronic musician Sean Yeaton in summer 2016 at a musical festival in the Netherlands, forming a friendship which led to the recording of Yellow Kitchen, which was recorded between December 2016 and May 2017 in Pennsylvania and California. The duo self-produced the album, while Kozelek wrote and sang the lyrics while Yeaton created the music, The album features guest appearances from Jim White, ex-Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley, Holly Throsby and Will Oldham (Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy). Shelley plays drums on \\"No Christmas Like This\\" while White plays drums on \\"Daffodils\\", while vocals are contributed by Throsby on \\"Time to Destination\\" and Oldham on \\"The Reasons I Love You\\". Yellow Kitchen is Kozelek's fourth release of 2017, following Sun Kil Moon's Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood, his solo Night Talks EP, and 30 Seconds to the Decline of Planet Earth, a collaboration between Sun Kil Moon and Jesu. Music and lyrics Written and spoken by Kozelek and autobiographical in nature, the lyrics and vocal delivery of Yellow Kitchen develop upon the stream of consciousness, spoken word style of Kozelek's work since Sun Kil Moon's Universal Themes (2015). As with Kozelek's other 2016-2017 releases, his words on the album reflect his concerns with his own aging and health, while touching on subjects such as celebrity deaths, restaurants Kozelek had dined at, films he had watched and why Kozelek's writing style had changed since the 1990s. Musically, Yellow Kitchen is abstract and cold in tone, as well as more experimental than other Kozelek albums, providing what Paul Simpson for AllMusic described as \\"a dreamlike, sometimes distant background for Kozelek's autobiographical rants.\\" Yeaton's music on the album is ambient and occasionally discordant, evoking what one reviewer described as a sense of paranoia. The style from the album is said to change between \\"avant-garde keyboard passage and ragged lo-fi indie rock,\\" especially on \\"No Christmas Like This\\". The dark atmosphere of the album matches the album's anxious lyrics, while Dylan Montanari of Spectrum Culture felt the album was cinematic and reminiscent of film techniques. Mark Kozelek (pictured in 2014) developed his spoken word style on Yellow Kitchen. In the opening song, \\"Time to Destination\\", Kozelek speaks harshly of the 2016 United States presidential election and its two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, while on a flight to Shanghai in October 2016. In addition to disputing current affairs, Kozelek discusses music venues, his own lyrical style, disc jockeys, the music industry, and fans of Kozelek's early band Red House Painters requesting unreleased, 25-year old music from them. Musically, the track is minimalist, taking inspiration from Philip Glass, and features resounding pianos, metallic clanging, oom-pah-styled tuba, and a \\"metronomic pulse.\\" \\"No Christmas Like This\\" concerns itself with \\"various inanities.\\" Kozelek recalls his Mardi Gras experiences on \\"I'm Still in Love with You\\". which quotes Steve McQueen's character Henri Charri√®re in Papillon (1973) and features mouth noises and tuneless yelping from Yeaton and an electronic backing. Soundblab compared it to a 1950s \\"beatnik coffee house performance art open mic night.\\" The fourth wall is broken on \\"Somebody's Favourite Song\\", in which Kozelek discusses the writing of the song itself, unsure of what its subject matter is going to be. Kozelek concedes the song will be precisely four minutes in duration, but after a brief silent interlude, the track begins again, with Kozelek continuing to recall conversations he was in. Considered by critics to be the most accessible track on the album, \\"The Reasons I Love You\\" is a sparse love song Kozelek directs at his girlfriend Caroline, its musical accompaniment including a kettle whistle, click track and acoustic guitar riff. The 12-minute \\"Daffodils\\" is an electronica track with a beat that has been compared to Kanye West's Yeezus. It is initially piano-driven as Kozelek recalls an open-mic night, but develops into electronic textures as the recollection become more paranoid. According to Spectrum Culture, \\"[t]he oneiric quality is broken by the redemptive image of photographed daffodils and an exchange between himself and a departed loved one, possibly [Kozelek's ex-girlfriend] Katy, a lingering muse in Kozelek‚Äôs songwriting.\\" Release and reception Yellow Kitchen was announced on May 2, 2017, initially with the release date of July 4. As a preview of the album, \\"The Reasons I Love You\\" was released onto Caldo Verde Records' website on June 19, 2017, the same day the album artwork and track listing were released and the release date of the album was brought forward. The album cover, a pastel yellow square, was designed by Brian Azer. Towards the end of June 2017, the album became available to stream on Sun Kil Moon's website, and Caldo Verde Records released the album shortly afterwards on June 30. On August 3, a music video for \\"Daffodils\\" was released, in which Kozelek holds up numerous objects, including novels, albums, world currencies, a postcard, among many other things. The album received both positive and mixed reviews from music critics, who found it a continuation of Kozelek's recent musical endeavours. Liam Prost of BeatRoute Magazine called the album \\"required listening for the Mark Kozelek completionist,\\" while also calling it \\"mostly just a strange distraction, a fun thing to smile about on the bus on your way to serve our corporate overlords.\\" Dylan Montanari of Spectrum Culture rated the album four stars out of five and said that while \\"[d]etractors find his musical output increasingly narcissistic, but I don‚Äôt buy it. I‚Äôm writing this on the 200th birthday of Henry David Thoreau, who once said, 'My life has been the poem I would have writ. But I could not both live and utter it.' Maybe no one can, but Mark Kozelek sure comes close.\\" Paul Simpson of AllMusic rated the album three stars out of five, while also hailing it as an \\"Album Pick\\". With its length of 41 minutes, Simpson found the album \\"short and succinct\\" compared to Kozelek's other albums of original material, \\"which might come as a relief to some listeners,\\" and writes that \\"even though the music is a bit more experimental, the effect is much the same. It's worth a listen if you enjoyed any of those releases, but otherwise it won't change your mind about Kozelek and the direction his music has taken.\\" Woody Delaney of The Student Playlist wrote that, while starkly different to Benji, \\"the main thing that the record proves is that he is a songwriter who truly walks to his own beat, and while some may consider it a weaker addition to his vast discography, it‚Äôs still a noteworthy deep-cut.\\" Earbuddy were more hostile, saying \\" these results are so pitiful that you wonder if this is all some mean-spirited joke on the listener.\\" Track listing All songs written by Mark Kozelek #\\"Time to Destination\\" ‚Äì 6:06 #\\"No Christmas Like This\\" ‚Äì 7:29 #\\"I'm Still in Love with You\\" ‚Äì 4:49 #\\"Somebody's Favourite Song\\" ‚Äì 7:25 #\\"The Reasons I Love You\\" ‚Äì 3:28 #\\"Daffodils\\" ‚Äì 11:59 Personnel *Brian Azer ‚Äì sleeve design *Jim White ‚Äì drums (track 6) *Steve Shelley ‚Äì drums (track 2) *Nathan Winter ‚Äì mixing, recording *Sean Yeaton ‚Äì music, co-production, recording *Mark Kozelek ‚Äì photography, co-production, lyrics, vocals *Adam Cox ‚Äì recording *Charlie Beuter ‚Äì recording *Will Chason ‚Äì recording *Holly Throsby ‚Äì additional voice (track 1) *Will Oldham ‚Äì additional voice (track 5) References 2017 albums Mark Kozelek albums Caldo Verde Records albums Experimental music albums by American artists Spoken word albums by American artists Ambient albums by American artists 2010s spoken word albums ","title":"Yellow Kitchen"},{"id":"55274667","text":"Milos Andric (born 1965) is a Norwegian entrepreneur in tourism and aviation.

The obtained binding curves using SCORE provide detailed information on kinetics and thermodynamics of the observed interaction(s) as well as on concentrations of the used analytes. These data can be relevant for pharmaceutical screening and drug design, biosensors and other biomedical applications, diagnostics, and cell-based assays. BLI, RIfS), or 2: monitoring the change in intensity of one wavelength in y-direction via a photodiode or camera (SCORE)  Principle  The underlying principle corresponds to that of the Fabry-P√©rot interferometer, which is also the underlying principle for the white-light interferometry.  Realisation / setup  Monochromatic light is illuminated vertically on the rear side of a transparent multi-layer substrate. The partial beams of the monochromatic light are transmitted and reflected at each interphase of the multi-layer system. Superimposition of the reflected beams result in destructive or constructive interference (depending on wavelength of the used light and the used substrate/multi-layer system materials) that can be detected in an intensity change of the reflected light using a photodiode, CCD, or CMOS element. The sensitive layer on top of the multi-layer system can be (bio-)chemically modified with receptor molecules, e.g. antibodies. Binding of specific ligands to the immobilised receptor molecules results in a change refractive index n and physical thickness d of the sensitive layer. The product of n and d results in the optical thickness (n*d) of the sensitive layer. 1: Monochromatic light is reflected at a biolayer interface, 2: upon binding the reflection conditions change, resulting in 3: a higher reflected intensity due to positive interference Example binding curve in an intensity vs time diagram Monitoring the change of the reflected intensity of the used light over time results in binding curves that provide information on: * concentration of used ligand * binding kinetics (association and dissociation rate constants) between receptor and ligand * binding strength (affinity) between receptor and ligand * specificity of the interaction between receptor and ligand Compared to bio-layer interferometry, which monitors the change of the interference pattern of reflected white light, SCORE only monitors the intensity change of the reflected light using a photodiode, CCD, or CMOS element. Thus, it is possible to analyse not only a single interaction but high-density arrays with up to 10,000 interactions per cm2.http://biametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170617_APS-Mueller-et- al.pdf Compared to surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which penetration depth is limited by the evanescent field, SCORE is limited by the coherence length of the light source, which is typically a few micrometers. This is especially relevant when investigating whole cell assays. Also, SCORE (as well as BLI) is not influenced by temperature fluctuations during the measurement, while SPR needs thermostabilisation. Multiplexed binding curves using an array format  Application  SCORE is especially used as detection method in bio- and chemosensors. It is a label-free technique like Reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS), Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which allows time-resolved observation of binding events on the sensor surface without the use of fluorescence or radioactive labels. The SCORE technology was commercialised by Biametrics GmbH, a service provider and instrument manufacturer with headquarters in T√ºbingen, Germany. In January 2020, Biametrics GmbH and its technology was acquired by BioCopy Holding AG, headquartered in Aadorf, Switzerland.

Early life The third of four siblings, the Venerable Pa√±√±ƒÅdƒ´pa was born on 19 April 1928 in Bilin‚Äôs Zoke Thoke Sanpya village. His name at birth was Aung Nyein. His father was San Pe and his mother was Saw Kyin. When he was five years old, he was sent to the Nyaungthaya monastery in Zoke Thoke. There he received a monastic education as per Burmese Buddhist tradition. The abbot of the monastery was Sayadaw U Gandama. At the age of twenty, he set off for Yangon, then called Rangoon. He studied mechanics and began to work for A War Shin, Co. as a driver mechanic. Marriages After working for three years as a driver mechanic, Aung Nyein married Hnin Myaing, the daughter of an auto parts shop owner. Together they had one child, a son. They were married for two years before they divorced due to pressures from their family. Their son was only six months old at the time. He married again, this time to Tin Kyi, the sister of one of his intimate friends. Together they had three children. He eventually worked and saved enough to buy his own taxi car and began working as an owner/driver. In his spare time, he worked as a mechanic. It was at this time that he began observing the Buddhist Sabbath and following nine precepts. He provided transport free of charge to monks, the sick, and the elderly. Five Spiritual Phases First Phase: White-Robed Religious Devotee Beginning in the summer of 1963, Aung Nyein began to study occult science from Manomaya Saya Khine. He practiced spiritual development at Naungdawgyi Pagoda, Shwedagon Pagoda, Shinmahti Pagoda, and Kyaikkasan Pagoda. He wore the clothes of a layman and continued this path continuously until 1965. He began to study manomaya, a form of mind cultivation. He was said to have gained psychic power at this time and referred to it as his \\"Sovereign Stage, Master of Sovereign Stage, White Robe Religious Devotee Stage\\". Second Phase: Mystic From 1966 to 1968, Aung Nyein kept his hair long, remained barefoot, and wore traditional white clothes to associate himself as a mystic seeker. He studied in ancient and historical pagodas and religious sites around the country. He concentrated on personal spiritual development by observing internal signs, external signs and astrology. He referred to this as his \\"Lunatic Stage.\\" At this time he did not ask for donations. The Third Phase: Ascetic In 1969, Aung Nyein made a decision to continue his practices in the future and arranged for the living of his family. He donned the robes of a hermit and became a recluse. He began to study the way of the weizza, a type of wizardry consisting of the study of alchemy, astrology, mystical signs and meditation. He was said to have gained psychic and supernatural power, including the ability to turn water into medicine. At this time he earned the reputation as Moemakha recluse because it was said that he could keep dry during rain. This period lasted until 1971. After the third phase was complete, he was known as the Hermit Naga Weizza Bho Sacca or Recluse Nagavijja Bothitsa. The Fourth Phase: Meditation Aung Nyein had spent nine years practicing and gaining proficiency in the aforesaid arts. In 1971, he went back to Zoke Thoke village. On the 1st Waxing Day of Kason 1333 ME, he was fully ordained to monkhood at 7:50 am on Thursday (25 April 1971) at Khanda Sima (ordination hall). He was then named U Pannadipa. His preceptor for ordination was U Indasabha of Naungdawgyi Monastery of Zoke Thoke. His father San Pe and mother Saw Kyin were present and supported him by providing his four requisites: clothing, food, shelter, and medicine. He took up residency at Kyaikhtisaung Pagoda. The old pagoda was in disrepair and hidden under heavy growth. He organized his disciples and local villagers to clear the area. Once the area was cleared, he rebuilt and renovated the old pagoda and old laterite hillock. The Fifth Phase: The Dipa Stage and His Exertions Soon after becoming a monk, U Pannadipa began to teach the Five Precepts, the Five Great Infinities, and the Five Forbidden Meats. He urged his followers to abstain from beef, pork, buffalo, horse, and elephant meat. This became known by his followers as the \\"Triple Five\\"' or \\"5-5-5\\". He discussed these matters nightly during Dhammapalin (nightly sermons), which lasted from 9:00pm, until 2:00am the next morning. These were open talks where he often received and answered questions from his devotees. For the next forty years, he set about restoring nine sacred pagodas throughout Myanmar, each claimed to contain preserved hair from Gautama Buddha. It is said that Buddha himself mentioned this in a prophecy when he gave strands of his hair to hermits and belus during a trip to the area. The claim is that he prophesied that after his hairs would be placed in nine pagodas, then abandoned for 2,500 years. After that, the pagodas would be found and restored. He further said that his teachings would then be observed zealously for another 2,500 years. Since the Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw started his project 2,515 years after Buddha's death, he is said to be the one to fulfill the prophecy. Notable work The Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw went on to improve the areas and villages around the pagoda. Under his care, rural roads and bridges were built and local schools were renovated. He provided free vegetarian meals to those who assisted in the restoration projects, guests from afar, and anyone who was seeking shelter at the pagoda for religious study. He distributed money, prayer books, meditation rosaries, and amulets to seekers who visited him. As a result of his charities, the region became a more developed area. Stone Inscriptions of U Khanti On 3 March 2011, the Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw had 135 of the stone inscriptions made by the Hermit U Khanti brought to the Kyaikhtisaung compound from Mandalay Hill. The Dhammazedi Bell In 2013, Myanmar Tycoon Khin Shwe worked together with the Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw to try to raise the Dhammazedi Bell from the Yangon River. The bell had been commissioned by King Dhammazedi in 1484 as a gift to the Shwedagon Pagoda of Dagon (Yangon). Honorary Titles Ashin Pannadipa was given the title \\"Agga Maha Saddhammajotikadhaja\\" by the Myanmar Ministry of Religious Affairs in 1992 in recognition of his service. This title is reserved for those who have contributed outstanding service to the propagation of the Sasana around the world. Later, in 2004, the ministry again conferred the honorary religious title of \\"Abhidhaja Agga Maha Saddhammajotikadhaja\\". In May 2014, when he was eighty-six years old, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Buddhist Studies by the Mahachulalongkon Rajavidyalaya University in Thailand. Resolute Aspirations of Venerable Kyaithisaung Sayadaw # \\"May the Suvannabhumi Sasana, the Golden Land of Myanmar, exist extensively, akin to the sun and moon.\\" # \\"May human beings all over the world be able to develop and share great loving kindness.\\" # \\"May Buddhism of the Golden Land of Myanmar brighten the world like the light of the sun and moon.\\" # \\"May the Buddha‚Äôs teachings have lasting significance, achieving the fulfillment of 5,000 years.\\" Death Abbot Bhaddanta Nargadipa, the second Sayardaw of Kyaikhtisaung, giving candy to a young child, 2016 The Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw died on 25 July 2015 at the age of 87 at Yangon's 1000-bed military hospital in Mingaladon Township. Four days prior, he had been admitted due to heart problems and difficulty breathing. Upon his death, the Kyaikhtisayadaw was succeeded by the abbot Bhaddanta Nargadipa.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon was released on June 24, 1939, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. The cartoon has been criticized for its stereotypical and insensitive depictions of Native Americans. Plot General Daffy is commanding Army Post No. 13 on the frontier, and his troops are a sorry lot. Soldier Porky refuses to get out of his bed‚Äîthat is, until Daffy comes in and eventually destroys it. Soon a tribe of Indians launches an attack on the post on horseback. Porky sees them approaching, and attempts to awaken the other sleeping soldiers. Among the subsequent gags are: An Indian drinks \\"fire water\\" and spits fire, carving an Indian-shaped hole in the front of the fort, then walks through it; a short Indian uses the bow-leg of a taller Indian to shoot arrows; and a soldier shoots over the wall at the enemy, keeping score to the tune of \\"Ten Little Indians.\\" Porky abandons the cannon for pistols, and soon calls for more bullets. Daffy, loaded down with ammunition and running toward Porky, stumbles, resulting in Daffy swallowing a large quantity of bullets, and begins firing them off through his mouth, uncontrollably. Taking the situation in hand, Porky uses Daffy as a machine gun, finally driving off the Indian invaders, who carve into a hillside, \\"Yanks Beat Indians 11-3\\" as they retreat. The battle now concluded, Daffy is relieved, saying, \\"I'm sure that's glad that's over with.\\" However, Daffy stumbles once again as he walks away, and again begins spitting out bullets uncontrollably, as we iris out. Slightly Daffy Friz Freleng remade the cartoon in Technicolor and released June 17, 1944 under the name Slightly Daffy. Unlike the remakes directed by Clampett, the short is mostly a frame-by-frame remake. However, it features new voice recording, a few new animated scenes, and re- orchestrated music. The Blue Ribbon reissue is approximately 49 seconds shorter than the original cartoon. Additional reused scenes from other cartoons include Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas (By Tex Avery) for the first few scenes of the Indians, and The Hardship of Miles Standish (Also by Freleng) for the scene of the Indians firing their bows.

He was a mentor to the critic Nora Sayre. Life The son of Robert Davenport (known as \\"Robin\\" or \\"Arthur\\"),The New Review, vol. 3, issue 31, 1976, pg 69 a self-described \\"dramatic author\\", writer and illustrator of children's stories, and writer of lyrics for popular songs (including as a collaborator with H. G. Pelissier on an adaptation of The Follies) and the actress Muriel George (who later married the actor Ernest Butcher), Davenport was primarily raised at Barons Court by his grandmother, and subsequently educated at St Paul's and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, at which latter he opted to study rather than taking up a history scholarship he had won to Hertford College, Oxford. He would later compare his childhood to the story of Compton Mackenzie's Sinister Street. Davenport's great- grandfather was the composer and musicologist Sir George Macfarren; Macfarren's daughter had married Francis (\\"Frank\\") William Davenport, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Royal Academy of Music, who was a collaborator, formerly pupil, of MacFarren.A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (A.D. 1450‚Äì1880), George Grove, Macmillan, 1889, pg 608Symphonies, Alice Mary Smith, ed. Ian Graham-Jones, A-R Editions Inc., 2003, pg xiHistorical Dictionary of English Music: ca. 1400‚Äì1958, Charles Edward McGuire and Steven E. Plank, Scarecrow Press Inc., 2011, pg 310British Women Composers and Instrumental Chamber Music in the Early Twentieth Century, Laura Seddon, Routledge, 2016, pg 25 The Davenports were mainly clergymen, originally from Cheshire, and kinsmen of the Davenports of Bramall Hall, at Bramhall, Greater Manchester (historically Cheshire). After coming down from Cambridge, Davenport worked for MGM as a screenwriter with F. Scott Fitzgerald; it was at this time he became acquainted with Nora Sayre's family. He taught at Stowe School in the 1940s, and worked for the BBC at Bush House as Head of the Belgian Section (he spoke fluent French, having lived there for some time) He was a close friend of Dylan Thomas, with whom, in 1941, he wrote The Death of the King's Canary, a satirical detective novel (it remained unpublished until 1976). Up at Cambridge as a contemporary of William Empson, Davenport was entrusted in 1947 with the only manuscript copy of Empson's The Face of the Buddha, which he subsequently misplaced whilst drunk. Although Davenport finally admitted to Empson in 1952 that he thought he had left the manuscript in a taxi, in fact he had given it to the Tamil poet, Tambimuttu, and it eventually made its way to publication many years later. Davenport was also a friend of the poet Malcolm Lowry, since their Cambridge days.Pursued by Furies: A Life of Malcolm Lowry, Gordon Bowker, pg 1 Davenport was renowned for his physical strength and willingness to employ that strength as a countermeasure to what he considered \\"impertinence\\" in others; he had been an all-in wrestler, as well as a noted boxer whilst at Cambridge, making a living for a time as a fairground boxer.Brief Lives, Paul Johnson, Random House, 2010, pg 88 One anecdote (related slightly differently by Paul Johnson and Nora Sayre)Brief Lives, Paul Johnson, Random House, 2010, pg 89 has him, whilst at either the Savage Club or the Savile Club, hoisting a man (per Johnson, Lord Maugham, the Lord Chancellor and brother of the author Somerset Maugham; per Sayre, a bishop) six feet into the air and depositing him upon a mantelpiece, from which descent proved complicated. Davenport was duly expelled from the club. In contrast to this bellicose approach, Davenport was considered \\"one of the most remarkable and talented men of his generation\\". In 1934, Davenport married Clemency (known as \\"Clement\\") Hale, a painter and set designer, daughter of Swinburne Hale, an American lawyer, and his wife Beatrice, nee Forbes-Robertson, the niece of the actor Sir Johnston Forbes- Robertson. Following their divorce, Davenport married Marjorie Morrison. He had children from both marriages, including a son, Roger, an author. In the 1960s, following difficulties with alcoholism, Davenport retired to the country where his mother lived, and died shortly afterwards.Brief Lives, Paul Johnson, Random House, 2010, pg 90 References 1908 births 1966 deaths English literary critics People educated at St Paul's School, London Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Place of birth missing Place of death missing ","title":"John Davenport (critic)"},{"id":"55275158","text":"The 1808 United States presidential election in South Carolina took place between November 4 and December 7, 1808, as part of the 1808 United States presidential election.

They are reputed to have been almost completely exterminated in the 1880s in reprisal for an incident in which some members of the tribe speared 4 miners. Country Wulwulam land extended over some from the headwaters of the Mary River westwards as far as Pine Creek, and southwards almost to Katherine. On their eastern flank, their boundary lay at the source of the South Alligator River. They were also reported in the Mount Bundy area. People According to Norman Tindale, the Norwegian ethnographer Knut Dahl was referring to the Wulwulam in those passages where he wrote of the Agigondin, a central tableland tribe and a horde called the Agoguila. History of contact The Wulwulam's numbers grew as a result of the rapid reduction of members of rwo tribes to their south and west as European colonization developed, namely the Agikwala, Awinmul and Awarai. Remnants of the two were absorbed into the Wulwulam as subtribal hordes. History Copper mining discovered near Mt. Haywood in 1882 led to the development of a settlement on tribal lands along the Daly River soon afterwards, and members of the Wulwulam tribe were drawn to the site and employed there. Starting on 3 September 1884, several Wulwulam murdered four European settlers and in a reprisal known as the Coppermine massacres. Francis Herbert Sachse who ran a cattle station and also managed the mine, led the massacre at Blackfellow Creek, where an estimated 150 natives were shot, leading to their effective extermination. The Norwegian ethnographer Knut Dahl, who lived in the area for over a year a decade later, wrote as follows: > The sequel, which in the Australian bush has always followed such murders, > occurred in due course... Another gathering of white men, friends and > fellows of the victims, also embarked upon a campaign of vengeance against > the Wolwanga tribe, which had been responsible for the deed. The reports on > this campaign vary, but participants have told me that after a long search > they finally found a great portion of the tribe gathered at the abandoned > mine. They surrounded them, drove them into a lagoon, and shot them all, > men, women and children. The pogrom continued for some years, enfeebling what had been the most powerful Daly river tribe, and also decimating the Mulluk-Mulluk tribe. Four Wulwulam men, Tommy, Jimmy, Daly, and Ajibbingwagne, were put on trial for the killings of 4 settlers, Johannes Lubrecht Noltenius, Jack Landers (known as Hellfire Jack), Henry Houschildt and Schollert. The Jesuit mission diary records Sachse as still waging his campaign against the Wulwulam 4 years later, in 1888. Charlie Yingi, known as Long Legged Charlie, one of the four Aboriginal men charged for the killings, was cleared eventually and settled at the Jesuit Mission on the Daly River. He was later sentenced to death for the Coppermine killing. In 2014 there came to light a document indicating that one child of Wulwulam/Woolwonga parentage had been registered in the census undertaken in 1889, and that by virtue of this fact, her descendants moved to assert native title rights to the old Wulwulam hunting grounds.
