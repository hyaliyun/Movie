Prominent visitors were met at the tree, on the outskirts of Annapolis, and escorted into the city. History The Three Mile Oak was last a tree stump from the 18th century. Presumably a white oak, about six feet in diameter, and originally located three miles from Annapolis in Parole, Anne Arundel County. The tree was struck by lightning, became hollow, was killed by fire, and finally blew down on May 22, 1909. At the site where the tree stood, a delegation is reported to have met George Washington en route to Annapolis, Maryland (then the U.S. capital) to resign his commission on December 19, 1783. Washington resigned as commander-in-chief on December 23. Plaque at Original Tree Site While on display outdoors for many years, the Three Mile Oak was exhibited with a plaque erected in 1967 by the Four Rivers Garden Club, Rotary of Annapolis, explaining its significance. The plaque states: Original plaque The plaque and tree trunk originally sat at the corner of West Street and Route 178 (Generals Highway). Three Mile Oak Stump with Rebar through Concrete Block The concrete block that held the twisted stump of the tree is still located at that spot, just outside the parking lot of Toys R Us, diagonally from the Applebee's at the Annapolis Mall. The twisted rebars rising out of the concrete block protected the rotting trunk of the tree. Concrete Block that held stump of Three Mile Oak Moving the Plaque The plaque was moved in 1967 down the road, approximately 500 feet, across from the Red Lobster and the former Famous Dave's Restaurants (now Uncle Julio‚Äôs). Local citizens feared that it would be destroyed by traffic if left unprotected at the corner of West Street and Defense Highway. A new oak tree was planted close to the relocated plaque. A new plaque was placed over the dismounted and moved original plaque.

The history of rail transport in Cameroon began at around the turn of the twentieth century. Colonial period = German colonial period = Share of the Kamerun-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, issued 1. March 1907 The topography of Cameroon was unfavourable for railway construction: mountains and a dense forest belt in the hinterland of the largest port, Douala, long prevented the entry of Cameroon into the railway era. The first railway to go into operation in Cameroon was a narrow gauge Feldbahn line, which was constructed by the private West African Planting Society Victoria () (WAPV). Initially, this railway ran from Zwingenberger Hof in Soppo, near Buea, the colonial capital of German Kamerun from 1901 to 1919, to the small port of Victoria, now known as Limbe, and also offered passenger services. It was later expanded. A similar gauge railway was built by the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC), more eastern of the (WAPV) and operational until the 1970s. The second railway to be built in Cameroon was the Douala‚ÄìNkongsamba railway, also known as the Northern Railway (), was built between 1906 and 1911 from Bonab√©ri (opposite Douala on the Wouri estuary) to Nkongsamba. The Cameroon Railway Corporation () was created for this purpose in 1906. The third railway was the Douala‚ÄìNgaoundere railway, also known as the Central Railway (). These two lines were built in metre gauge and set the standards for future railway construction in Cameroon. Construction of the third railway, known as the Central Railway, was carried by a German private company in the period 1910-1914 from the port of Douala to Es√©ka =French and British mandate= After the Armistice in 1918, the majority of Cameroon was granted to France as a League of Nations mandate, with the rest being granted to the United Kingdom. The League of Nations \\"trusteeship\\" did not animate the French colonial powers to make greater investment in Cameroon's railways. Initially, they did no more than restore the lines constructed under German rule to operating condition. The Northern Railway and the Central Railway were merged as the Chemins de fer de Cameroun (CFC), but continued to operate as two separate networks. Under the French mandate, the construction of the Central Railway was continued and by 1927 reached Yaound√©. The seat of the colonial administration was then moved there. The closure of the gap to Mbalmayo was first achieved by a railway from Ot√©l√©, with Feldbahn motive power and rolling stock. Only in 1933 was the extension converted to metre gauge. The changeover to diesel operation was accelerated from 1950, because all coal had to be imported from South Africa and this led repeatedly to irregularities in the course of delivery. In 1955, a structural link was made between the Central Railway and the Northern Railway, via a section of line and a bridge over the Wouri River.Schroeter (1961). p 58. Republic of Cameroon Independent from 1960, the Republic of Cameroon devoted its initial rail transport efforts to the construction of a branch from the Northern Railway to Kumba. This line went into operation in 1969. The new Republic's biggest project was a extension of the Central Railway from Yaound√© to Ngaound√©r√©, known as the transcamerounais or Trans-Cameroon Railway. Funds for the Yaound√©-Belabo segment amounting 37.85 million dollars was provided by the European Common Market, France and USAID. Construction started in late 1964 and went into operation in 1974, and the maximum extent reached by the rail network was . In the 1970s, the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC) commissioned a new railway similar to, and immediately to the east of, Cameroon's original WAPV network. Reports as to its gauge vary between and .Schroeter; Ramaer (1993). p 119. A lower level section of the Central Railway was partially rerouted between 1975 and 1983. However, the line was closed beyond Nkongsamba, and some of the tracks were removed. The global privatisation wave reached Cameroon's railway network in 1996. A 30-year concession for the operation of the network was awarded on 19 January 1999 to Camrail, a subsidiary of Groupe Bollor√©. Camrail, also known as Cameroon Railways, carries passengers as well as freight. In 2016 the country suffered the worst rail accident in its history after an overloaded train derailed near the town of Es√©ka, killing at least 70 people.

His army service began in 1792 during the French Revolution when he enlisted in a cavalry regiment as a trooper. He spent his entire military career as a cavalryman. During the French Revolutionary Wars he advanced through the ranks and became commander of a light cavalry regiment in 1802. While only a colonel, he commanded a brigade at Caldiero in October 1805. He fought in the Friedland campaign in 1807 and attained the rank of general officer that year. As a cavalry brigadier, he participated in the 1807 Invasion of Portugal but was captured in 1808 and held until 1812. He led a brigade in 1813 and a division 1814 during the War of the Sixth Coalition. After fighting for Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he retired in 1823. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 40.  Career  Maurin was born in Montpellier, France on 19 December 1771. He joined the 20th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment as a trooper in 1792. He served in a number of actions during the War of the First Coalition rising to the rank of officer. He was wounded in the shoulder by a saber cut at Biberach in 1796. The following year he fought at Valvasone and received a battlefield promotion to captain from Napoleon Bonaparte. That year he was an aide-de-camp to Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, then a division commander. Believing he was about to be replaced, Bernadotte wrote a letter to Napoleon Bonaparte asking that he find employment for his aides Maurin and Eug√®ne-Casimir Villatte. On 24 April 1802 he was named to lead the 24th Chasseur √† Cheval Regiment as Chef de Brigade (colonel). While still a colonel, he led a brigade consisting of the 15th and 24th Chasseurs √† Cheval at the Battle of Caldiero on 29‚Äì31 October 1805. Transferred to Poland, he fought at Guttstadt and Friedland in 1807 and was promoted to general of brigade on 25 June 1807. Maurin led a cavalry brigade in Andoche Junot's army during the 1807 Invasion of Portugal. He was named Baron of the Empire on 17 March 1808. He reported to Fran√ßois √âtienne de Kellermann who commanded a cavalry division that included one squadron each of the 26th Chasseurs √† Cheval, 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, and 15th Dragoons. He was appointed governor of Algarve province in the south of Portugal. When the revolt against the French occupation broke out, he was in his sickbed in Faro. He and 70 other French soldiers were captured by Portuguese partisans on 16 June 1808 and handed over to the captain of a British vessel as prisoners. He remained a prisoner until September 1812. On his return he fought at the Battle of Dresden on 26‚Äì27 August 1813. He received the Commander's Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 28 September 1813. Maurin commanded the 9th Light Cavalry Brigade in R√©mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans' division of the II Cavalry Corps at the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October. The following year he was named to command the 2nd Light Cavalry Division and led this unit at the Battle of Laubressel on 3‚Äì4 March 1814. After Napoleon's abdication he submitted to King Louis XVIII of France. He later rejoined the emperor during the Hundred Days and was appointed to command the 7th Cavalry Division in the 1815 campaign. The division's 1st Brigade was led by Louis Vallin and consisted of the 6th Hussars and 8th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. The 2nd Brigade was under Pierre Marie Auguste Berruyer and comprised the 6th, 11th, and 18th Dragoon Regiments. At the Battle of Ligny on 16 June 1815, he was wounded in the chest by a bullet. Maurin retired in 1823. After the July Revolution of 1830 he returned to active service but died on 4 October 1830.

The fountain until the end of 2014 was located across the street of via Medina across from the church of Santa Maria Incoronata, Naples and a few doors south of the church complex of Pieta di Turchini. Now the fountain is located in front of the Town hill building, its location changed due to the construction of the new underground station (Municipio Station - Line 1). History Its construction dates back to the period of Spanish Viceroyalty of Enrique de Guzman, Count of Olivares. It was built by Giovanni Domenico D'Auria using a design by the Swiss architect Domenico Fontana (born: 1543, Melide, Switzerland), between 1600 and 1601. Also involved in its completion were the sculptor-architects Michelangelo Naccherino, Pietro Bernini, and Cosimo Fanzago. The fountain originally stood near the Arsenal in the port. In 1629,it was transported to Largo di Palazzo (now Piazza del Plebiscito), near the Royal Palace of Naples, but since it hindered the festivals held in the plaza there, the fountain was again moved to Borgo Santa Lucia, near Castel dell'Ovo. There, more statues, these by Fanzago were added. In 1638, it was again moved, this time to Largo delle Corregge, today Via Medina. During the revolt of Masaniello in 1647, the statue was damaged. Further damage occurred during the sacking of Naples in 1672 by the Viceroy Pedro Antonio de Arag√≥n. In 1675, it underwent restoration and was moved to the Molo Grande. This migratory fountain has continued to move through Naples: in 1886, it was dismantled, to reappear two years later in the Piazza Plaza della Borsa (now Plaza Giovanni Bovio), where it stood till 2000, when she was returned to Via Medina to allow for work on the Naples Metro. Description  The fountain is circular and surrounded by a balustrade. Water flows from four lions who hold shields with the symbols of Medina y de Carafa. Two sea monsters pour water in the central shell, adorned with dolphins and Tritons that also emit water; this was carved by Pietro Bernini. In the center, on a rock, two nymphs and two satyrs hold up a saucer that features a statue of Neptune with trident; this portion was sculpted by Naccherino.

He first described the geology and natural wonders of Mount Fru≈°ka and what became in 1960 the Fruska Gora National Park. He did the first scientific investigation of the mineral springs at Vrnjaƒçka Banja. The town of Becej was in Hungary at the time, and when he was less than a year old his family lost everything in the turmoil of the abortive revolution of 1848. He father, who fought in the revolution, died in 1856, a broken man. His mother believed strongly in education and scrimped enough to keep him, and his two brothers, in school. Aleksandar Popoviƒá tutored other students and won scholarships to complete his basic education in Pest. His older brother Stephan gained preferment with the Serbian PrinceAlexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá who was living in Pest at the time, and thus was able to support the family, allowing Aleksandar Popoviƒá to attend the University of Budapest where he studied geology under Professor J√≥zsef Szab√≥. It was at this time that Aleksandar Popoviƒá began to use the second last name of \\"Sandor\\". Under Szab√≥, Aleksandar Popoviƒá undertook a number of survey field trips, notably to the Mount Fru≈°ka region. On one of these he discovered trachyte a volcanic rock easy to mine as a building stone. He reported his finding and was supported by Professor Szab√≥; however, by the time that a delegation from the Hungarian Geological Society went to look at the find, it had all been hauled away by local builders. It was only subsequently that Aleksandar Popoviƒá was vindicated when he discovered a second locale of trachyte in the Mount Fru≈°ka area. By the time Aleksandar Popoviƒá graduated, he was a member of the Hungarian Geological Society and the Geological Society of Vienna. He accepted a position teaching at the high school in Novi Sad, although he was over-educated for the position, it allowed him to be closer to the mountains and gave him spare time for his researches. He taught natural science, mathematics, and Hungarian, as well as such other science classes as were temporarily lacking faculty. He was very interested in combating illiteracy, and published the first grammar-school textbooks in Serbian. He worked on translations of German and English works into Serbian, but was unfortunately taken by tuberculosis before reaching his thirtieth birthday. When Professor Szab√≥ was informed of Aleksandar Popoviƒá's death, he exclaimed, with tears in his eyes, Friend, I just cannot judge what a loss for Science is Sandor's death..–ü—Ä–∏—ò–∞—Ç–µ—ô—É, —Å–∞–º–æ —ò–∞ –º–æ–≥—É –¥–∞ –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∏–º, —à—Ç–∞ —ò–µ –∏–∑–≥—É–±–∏–ª–∞ –Ω–∞—É- –∫–∞ —Å–º—Ä—õ—É –®–∞–Ω–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–æ–º.

It aimed to build the relationship between government and fashion industry and represent the interests of London couturiers. The organisation continued after the war and sought to present itself as an alternative to the revived Paris couture industry. Establishment Some sources suggest Inc Soc was established by Harry Yoxall, managing editor of British Vogue, and others indicate it was the idea of Sir Cecil Weir of the Board of Trade. Ernestine Carter states that the IncSoc had its origins in 1941 with an export collection sent to South America by the British Colour Council, designed by Charles Creed (at Fortnum & Mason), Norman Hartnell, Edward Molyneux, Digby Morton, Peter Russell, Victor Stiebel (of Jacqmar) and Worth London. Along with Bianca Mosca and Hardy Amies, all would go on to be founder-members of the IncSoc the following year, except Creed, who was the first designer voted in as a member. In March 1942, on the invitation of the Board of Trade, the members of Inc Soc ‚Äì all of whom were used to custom-creating designs for customers ‚Äì designed 34 utility clothing garments suitable for mass manufacture in order to demonstrate how high-fashion elegance could be achieved within the strict rationing restrictions. Known as the Couturier Scheme, the project had a very high profile in the press at the time with a fashion show held to launch the clothes. The prototype models were featured in Vogue magazine and donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum later that year. Post-war activities Inc Soc had organised seasonal showings in each London couture house based on the Parisian couture system. After the war, Inc Soc coordinated spring and autumn collections in London with the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris to allow cash-rich overseas buyers to take in both cities' collections. In 1949, members of Inc Soc showcased British fashion in the film Maytime in Mayfair in a sequence that showed models wearing an outfit by each of the ten member designers. In July 1968, The Guardian reported that although associate membership for makers of hats, gloves, shoes and other accessories had been wound up, the society continued with Edward Rayne as chairman and Lady Hartwell (previously Lady Pamela Berry) as president. By 1969, IncSoc was reported to be struggling due to high taxes and overheads and competition from London's booming ready-to-wear designers. Most had added ready-to-wear designs to shore up their businesses. In January that year the society ‚Äì which had shrunk from 12 to seven members over the previous six years ‚Äì announced it would no longer host a group fashion event for UK and international buyers. Instead, each designer would host an individual show. The organisation was still extant in 1974, but disbanded soon afterwards. Membership The founding members were nicknamed the \\"Big Eight\\" in the press of the time. By 1949 they had become the \\"Big Ten\\" or \\"Top Ten of Fashion\\". The fashion journalist Ernestine Carter recalled in 1974: \\"At one point we called them the Top Ten, another the First Eleven, once the Baker's Dozen, then a Rowing Eight. Finally, we stopped giving them numbers at all.\\" Each new member needed to receive the votes of at least two-thirds of the existing members. Normally, the designer had to have shown at least four collections before being considered for membership, although some later members achieved this faster, due to the strength of their work. =IncSoc members and joining dates= Listings show joining date, where known, and were originally published in an article in Costume, the journal of the Costume Society, in 2001. The couture house of Rahvis is not included in that article, but was listed as among the members in the 1960s in UK and international newspaper reports. In 1974, Ernestine Carter put together a potted history of the Society with the assistance of Ann Ryan, who administrated the Society between 1956 and 1960. They noted that Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, and Rahvis were the last three remaining members of the Society, with the shoemaker Edward Rayne, 'though not defunct, in abeyance.' *Hardy Amies ‚Äì 1942, founder member.

In 2000, he became a solo artist. In 2002, he relocated to America and married female singer Trizzie Phuong Trinh. From 2004 to 2008, his Vietnam citizenship was revoked. Apparently, he is one of the exclusive singers of Thuy Nga Center.. He is a tenor. His contemporaries include Lam Truong, Minh Thuan, Phuong Thanh, My Linh, Duong Chi Linh, Quang Linh and Minh Tuyet. In September 2012, he visited Vietnam and was granted allowance perform from October to December 2012 by the Bureau of Art Performance.  Early life  Ki·ªÅu is the youngest son of his father's third wife. His mother is Vietnamese opera singer Luu Nga, while father Nguyen Bang Bui is a doctor. The family lived in a small loft on Ngo Si Lien Street in Hanoi. His father worked at a hospital and his mother sold pho when not performing. When Ki·ªÅu revealed his talent for singing, his family invested all of their money for him to learn music. During his mother's pregnancy, she used to dream of picking him up at Xa Kieu bridge, explaining his name. Early in his career, he said that he was \\"miserable [with his] not- so-modern name\\". Later, he admitted that his \\"name is pretty unique\\".  Career  = Debut: 1989‚Äì2000 = In 1989, he studied bassoon at Hanoi Music Institute, where he founded the band Golden Key. From 1990 to 1996, he was a member of Frangipani. In 1998, he established another band called Watermelon, which included Anh Tu, Tuan Hung and Tuong Van. Watermelon disbanded in 2000, and Ki·ªÅu embarked upon his solo career. = National success = He found much success as a solo artist, and was invited to perform in national and local shows. He performed alongside songwriters and singers including Duyen Dang Viet Nam, Green Wave and Nhip Cau Am Nhac in Dong Thoi Gian 2002. In May 2001, he appeared in a play by Ho Chi Minh City's Television Broadcast Station. His acting received positive reviews though the show itself found little success. He was named as \\"multi-talented boy\\" by Tuoi Tre Newspaper. In September that year, he participated in a football match against a team of Hong Kong actors in a charity match for the Vietnam Deaf People Foundation. = Touring: 2001‚Äì2003 = In 2001, the movement of bringing singers to perform abroad by Ho Chi Minh City's Performance Organization Company gained success. Kieu and artist crew had a 1-month tour at the request of the Vietnamese community in Eastern Europe. Previously, he had performed in America as well as learning studio techniques. He performed in Australia in 2002. After the release of album Chuyen La, he toured in America and Vietnam and recorded his second album. He assisted Trinh in business and preparing for their wedding. Beside singing, he was acting and working with Trinh, including a musical tea room and coffee shop in Ho Chi Minh City. In September 2002, they married and relocated to America. For a period of time, there were some Vietnamese- Americans protested that Kieu was assigned to spread the \\"culture movement\\" of Vietnamese communism in America. During a show in 2003, he shared that he would like to be a part of the Vietnamese-American community. He was welcomed in many places in America and Canada. He performed in Australia, Philippines, Netherlands, Germany and Czech Republic. = Incident: 2003‚Äì2004 = In middle of November 2003, he visited his family in Hanoi. In 25 November, website Tin Tuc Vietnam Thoi Doi Moi run by the Bureau of Culture and Information posted an interview titled Kieu Bang Kieu. The interview stirred confusion and disagreement among artists, the overseas community and Vietnam, including his statement that he was the highest paid Vietnamese artist in America, that he belonged to the generation of \\"enthusiastically dispelling Vietnamese-American music off Vietnam\\", that he deliberately avoided music shows abroad, as well as verdicts about the taste and working ethic of music shows in Vietnam. In 27 December 2003, in a meeting, the leader of the Vietnamese community in Sacramento issued an official statement attacking him for having \\"internal activities assigned from Vietnam Communism in order to corrupt Vietnamese refugees oversea\\". Facing the incident, he clarified that \\"the interview was twisted for bad purposes\\", that he did have an interview with the journalist but it was regarding common stories, unlike the statement in the interview. After returning to America, he made some controversial statements as clarification for the incident, as: \\"In most recent visit, I had denied many big music shows to prove my will toward the land of freedom...Hopefully everyone will be pleased to accept me as a new member of the community\\". This statement was claimed to be a betrayal by Cong An Nhan Dan. Afterwards, during a show, a manager named Viet Dzung appointed someone to insert the flag of the Republic of Vietnam in the bouquet so that when Kieu waved the bouquet, he would be waving that flag. This image was recorded and exaggerated for political purposes. Accordingly, all of the songs performed by Kieu at Paris By Night shows were planned by Viet Dzung for \\"political purposes\\". In February 2004, the Bureau of Art ‚Äì Performance temporarily postponed his shows. On 22 November, they made a statement to related agencies and individuals not to use any song and performance of Bang Kieu. Following the statement, his citizenship was officially annulled. = 2004‚Äì = He collaborates with Thuy Nga Center. He often appears in Paris By Night including 80, 85, 86, 88, 91, 96, 98, 99 and 100, singing and acting. At the end of February 2008, after 4-year living in America, he and family visited Vietnam. He shared that he was \\"so happy\\", but did not perform or give interviews, saying, \\"[I[ don't know what to say right now\\". During this visit, he attended music shows in the audience. Touched by the enthusiasm of the audience, he stated, \\"hopefully I could perform for Vietnamese audience in Vietnam\\". In March 2010, he again visited Vietnam for the birthday party of singer Hong Nhung. Afterward, during a visit to Phnom Penh in December 2011, he and his family visited Vietnam. He held a fan meeting at Club Passion in Hanoi that was so crowded that the police canceled the event after 15 minutes. In 25 September 2012, he and singer Khanh Ly were authorized to perform in Vietnam by Bureau of Art Performance, which lasted until December same year. His first live show in Vietnam came the following month, involving him and his duet partner Minh Tuy·∫øt.  Personal life  He had a 6-year relationship with singer My Linh. He later dated Tang Hue Van. He encouraged her music career. Later he met American-Vietnamese Trizzie Phuong Trinh in Duyen Dang Vietnam in April 2000. He claimed he abandoned smoking, admitting that it damaged his voice. However, according to Trizzie, he kept smoking. In September 2002, they married. The wedding was held in America and Hanoi before relocating to South California. Their first son was named Beckham Bang Phuong. By 2012, he had three sons. He shared that he would never have a duet with Trizzie due to the differences in style and vocal ability. In May 2013, it was rumored that they divorced. Until 2014, it was rumored that he was in a relationship with Miss Vietnam, Duong My Linh.  Style  In 2002, he shared that his music style was influenced by songwriter Duong Thu. His songs were mostly romantic, not sad and sorrowful. He used to say that his singing was his priority, however he changed his mind and paid more attention to performance costume \\"to show respect to the audiences\\".

The series was scheduled to occur over four weekends in September 2012, culminating with the 116th AFL/VFL Grand Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 29 September 2012.  The finals system  The system is a final eight system. This system is currently used by the National Rugby League, and is different from the McIntyre Final Eight System, which was previously used by both the AFL and the NRL. The top four teams in the eight receive what is popularly known as the \\"double chance\\" when they play in week- one qualifying finals. This means that even if a top-four team loses in the first week, it still remains in the finals, playing a semi-final the next week against the winner of an elimination final. The bottom four of the eight play knock-out games, in that only the winners survive and move on to the next week. Home-state advantage goes to the team with the higher seed in the first two weeks, to the qualifying final winners in the third week. Games in Victoria are played at the MCG, regardless of the team's usual home ground, if a crowd larger than the seating capacity of Etihad Stadium (53,359) is expected. In the second week, the winners of the qualifying finals receive a bye to the third week. The losers of the qualifying final plays the elimination finals winners in a semi-final.

The AFL dismissed suggestions that ticket prices were to blame, but said the unusual starting time and possibly the pessimistic expectations of local supporters following their defeat to Sydney the previous week may have led to the poor turnout. *In week 3, a potential fixturing clash between the AFL and NRL at ANZ Stadium in Sydney led to the AFL scheduling the second preliminary on the Friday night. The SCG would usually be used for finals in the event of a fixture clash at ANZ Stadium, but it was unavailable due to a redevelopment. Normally, it is AFL policy to schedule the highest ranked qualifying winner on the Friday night to give that team the longest time to prepare for the Grand Final the following week. *There was a disagreement about starting time of the first preliminary final. pushed for a day game to minimise the time difference between its game and the second preliminary final the night before; the AFL and broadcasters preferred a night time-slot to maximise television audiences. The AFL ultimately scheduled a twilight 5:15 pm AEST game as a compromise between the two drivers.

It is part of the Vacha Cascade Joint Implementation Project involving three more dams and four power stations. The two other existing dams on the Vacha River are the Kamak Dam and the Tsankov Dam; the Krichim Dam is in the implementation stage. Completed on 5 November 1975, the Vacha Dam is situated above sea level. The dam was designed by Bulgarian hydroengineers, though their work was overseen by Russian, Japanese and Italian experts. It is a concrete gravity structure of height, making it the tallest dam in Bulgaria. Its pumped storage power plant has a capacity of 160 MW. History The potential of hydroelectric projects on the Vacha River in southern Bulgaria was recognized by the Bulgarian government at least as early as the early 1960s. The June 1962 edition of Water Power stated that the dam was \\"scheduled to add 436 MW to the Bulgarian system by the end of 1965.\\" In 1964, Energy International reported that dam construction on the river was underway. It appears that development of the dam took longer than expected, eventually completed in 1975. As the dam was designed for a maximum seismic design acceleration of 0.05 g according to the regulations apparent in Bulgaria in 1964, it was considered appropriate to study the safety of the dam structure by two dimensional finite element method under revised seismic norms prescribed in 1984, namely for two levels, the ‚ÄúDesign Earthquake (DE)‚Äù and Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE), taking due note of the interaction between the foundation soil and the structure and the non-linear behaviour of concrete. The seismic accelerations considered in the analysis were 0.32 g, 0.5 g and 1.1 g. The analysis concluded that the dam is safe under the seismic considerations except that partial damage could occur under the maximum seismic design factor but the dam would not fail. In February 2012, Bulgarian Minister of Economy and Energy, Traycho Traykov started an inspection of dams in the country, amongst them Vacha and Krichim dams and the Orpheus Water Power Plant. The inspection was initiated by reports that dams in the region had been overflowing and were hazardous, and engineers in the country warned that the problem would worsen due to snow melt and cause potential flooding. Geography The Vacha Dam Reservoir has been created as a part of cascade development on the Vacha River in southern Bulgaria. Vacha River, one of the main right tributaries of the Maritsa, is the second longest river that has its source in the Rhodopes, the Arda being the longest. It is long and is formed by the confluence of the rivers Chairdere and Buynovska. The Vacha runs through the Rhodopes forming a deep valley where the two dams, the Krichim and Vacha, are located. The reservoir lies from Plovdiv, one of Bulgaria's major cities, and a potential breach in the dam walls would gravely endanger the city. In the direct vicinity of the reservoir is the town of Krichim. Vacha reservoir Features The Vacha Dam is in height and has a water spread which stretches upstream. The dam is hemmed between the Krichin Reservoir on the upstream and the Devan HPP and is part of the Dospad-Vacha cascade development involving six dams. The construction of this highest concreted masonry dam in Bulgaria was started in the 1960s and completed in 1975. The benefits derived from the project cover power generation of 160 MW, irrigation, reservoir fisheries and drinking water supply to part of Plovdiv Province. There is a monument to the members of the World War II anti-fascist Anton Ivanov Rhodope Partisan Detachment in the area. =Reservoir= The reservoir created by the Vacha Dam stretches upstream over a length of . Physicochemical analysis of the reservoir water has been carried out during 2008 and 2009 to determine the diversity, distribution and quantitative development of phytoplankton, and to primarily evaluate the presence of cyanotoxins from the point of view of reservoir water usage as a safe drinking water source. The study indicated that the level of cyanotoxin in the reservoir was within limits. Continued monitoring of the level of cyanoprokaryota and their toxins was considered essential in all reservoirs for risk assessment of the water for contamination. The Vacha reservoir has been stocked with catfish, carp and other fish species popular among fishermen. The locals tell a legend of a human-sized catfish called The Golden One who inhabits the depths of the dam and whose scales flicker in warm and still weather. As of 2003, there are three houseboats permanently moored in the reservoir.

The plant grows throughout the reserve and is mentioned in the Natural England citation for Shorn Cliff and Caswell Woods.Natural England SSSI information on the citation Plants The nature reserve in spring supports Wood Anemone, Cuckooflower, Bluebell, Ramsons, Herb-Paris and frequent Toothwort which is parasitic on the mature hazel coppice. Woodland management The Forestry Commission replanted the grove in 1966. The grove was previously an area of coppicing (as are many of the woods in the Wye Valley). The replanting consisted of Beech and Corsican Pine. Since that time natural loss has encouraged replacement with Ash, Wild Cherry, Silver Birch and Sycamore. Some of this has been coppice regeneration. There is a varied shrub underlayer which includes Goat Willow, Elder and Hazel, with plentiful Traveller's-joy Conservation A high forest canopy and limited scrub were originally considered to be the best conditions to support and to spread the Martagon Lily. The management programme now looks to release the derelict coppice by removal of the crowded Corsican pines. Lily Beetle and browsing Fallow Deer have been noted as the biggest hindrance to Martagon Lily, which despite this, is still found in good numbers.

His original destination may have been Sydney, but while the ship was in Hobart, he met a cousin, surgeon Captain Russell of the 63rd Regiment, who persuaded him to settle in Tasmania. Daniel found employment as a schoolmaster, then at Peter DeGraves' (1878 ‚Äì 31 December 1852) Cascade Brewery at The Cascades in Hobart. A year later they received news of the Proclamation of South Australia and he chartered a yacht and with a cargo of supplies headed for the new colony, arriving at Holdfast Bay early in 1837, Mary following in the Siren, on which yacht their second child, James Francis, was born.

Plot synopsis  In Mexico in 1895, Clementine Templeton is obsessively tracking the wanted man known as Sentenza for deserting her and their infant child. In her travels, she happens upon a gang of former prostitutes led by Mary Black, whose young daughter was also impregnated and abandoned by Sentenza. They eventually locate their prey and corner him in a remote ghost town called Amnesty; which is haunted by the vengeful ghost of slain preacher Mobius Lockhardt, who has made a pact with the devil to remain as an earthbound spirit unable to travel beyond the borders of the town's cemetery and slaughtering any who trespasses. But there are many secrets surrounding the group and the town of Amnesty, and not everyone's motives are what they appear to be on the surface. As bloody betrayals and misdeeds come back to haunt them, they must confront their pasts if they hope to escape Amnesty and the vengeful wrath of Mobius Lockhardt alive.

He was a Councillor on Warringah Council from 1973 to 1995 and was Shire President from 1979‚Äì1983. Early life and background Couvret was born in June 1922 in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, the son of Paul Couvret, an accountant, and Anne-Marie, a trained nurse. When World War Two came to the Netherlands in 1940, Couvret signed up to the Royal Netherlands Navy but by the time the East Indies were invaded by the Empire of Japan, he was taken prisoner during service in the Indian Ocean on 8 March 1942, aged 20. He was subsequently transported to Nagasaki on board the Asama Maru in October 1942, where he spent the rest of the war. On 9 August 1945, Couvret was working in a sunken dock in Nagasaki Harbour when an atom bomb exploded six kilometres away. He dived under the ship he had been working on and was thus protected from the explosion. =Immigration to Australia= Upon being liberated by sailors of the US Navy on 11 September 1945, Couvret returned to service with the Dutch Navy, this time as a pilot in the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service. His father had died in a Japanese prison in Bandoeng and his mother had died of starvation in a nearby women's camp. Therefore, at the end of 1945 he came to Australia for six months to assist with the evacuation of prisoners of war from the East. Couvret was eventually demobilised in July 1947 and then repatriated to the Netherlands. However, he decided to return to Australia, arriving in Sydney on the SS Volendam in January 1949, aged 27. Couvret eventually settled in the rural town of Cowra, New South Wales, becoming a Primary School teacher at the Cowra Migrant Centre, where he met his wife, Hilja Seltam, an Estonian migrant. They were married at the St Peter's Presbyterian Church, Cowra, on 25 August 1951. Here, he eventually acquired Australian naturalisation in 1951, which enabled him to gain employment with the NSW Department of Education. His first position was teaching physical education at Cowra High School, where he remained for ten years, and then as Special Master at Lithgow High School. Eventually he took the position of Special Master at Balgowlah Boys High School, which enabled him to move back to Sydney and settle in the Forest district of the North Shore. His last position as a teacher was his role as Deputy Principal of the NSW Correspondence School, retiring in August 1982. He strongly involved in his local community, joining the Apex club, Frenchs Forest Rotary and was a founding member of Belrose Rotary Club. Council Couvret started his career in local government when the local 'B' riding councillor, Thomas Farrell retired, sparking a by-election for his seat on Warringah Shire Council. Couvret was subsequently elected as an Independent on 24 February 1973. For the 1977 elections, C Riding was split into two and Couvret's B riding was renamed D riding. Couvret eventually rose to be Deputy Shire President in 1978 and then Shire President in September 1979, where he presided over long-term planning for the Warringah area and various projects, including the Glen Street Theatre and the Oxford Falls Peace Park. He served as President until 1983. Couvret remained as a councillor until the council was dismissed in December 1985 by the Wran Government following supposed discrepancies in council planning decisions. However, following a successful legal challenge against the government by the NSW Fraud Ombudsman, it was subsequently found that there was no evidence of corruption to support the dismissal, and that \\"the elected councillors were denied natural justice and were both unfairly and unlawfully dismissed\\". When the council was returned on 14 March 1987 after the local elections, Couvret was returned as a councillor. In 1993 Couvret returned to Nagasaki to attend a conference of Mayors for Peace. He met a Japanese woman who as a child had been forced to work in the same shipyard. Remaining on Council, following the proclamation of former A Riding as Pittwater Council, his D Riding was renamed 'C Ward', and served until his retirement in 1995 (following the passing of the Local Government Act 1993, Warringah Council dropped 'Shire' and Shire Presidents became Mayors). In addition, Couvret served on the executive of the Local Government Association of NSW for eight years. Later life In 1998 he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) \\"for service to local government through the Warringah Shire Council, to veterans, and to the community\\" and is also on the Order of Australia Medal Committee. Couvret also received the Centenary Medal in 2001. He was also the President of the Dutch Australia Association and the Netherlands Ex-Servicemen & Women's Association and the President of Wakehurst Public School and Davidson High School parents and citizens associations. On 25 February 2011, he was appointed by Queen Beatrix as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau and invested at a ceremony commemorating the Battle of the Java Sea by the Dutch Consul-General in Sydney, Jaap Fredericks. Couvret died aged 91 on 5 July 2013. In June 2014, Warringah Council voted to commemorate Couvret's service by installing a plaque in his honour, to be placed at the Oxford Falls Peace Park, of which Couvret had been a driving force in its establishment and conservation of the historic one-room school. The plaque was unveiled on ANZAC Day 2015. In August 2014, the Dutch Ambassador to Australia, Annemieke Ruigrok, launched the publication of Couvret's memoirs: \\"Memoirs of Paul Couvret: A story of colonialism and war, peace and reconciliation in the Pacific\\", compiled by historian Edith van Loo.

Aaron Swartz, Aaron Swartz, an American computer programmer, writer, political organizer and Internet activist, was prosecuted for multiple violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), after downloading many academic journal articles through the MIT computer network from a source (JSTOR) for which he had an account as a Harvard research fellow. Facing trial and the possibility of imprisonment, Swartz committed suicide, and the case was consequently dismissed.July 2011 Initial Federal Indictment of Aaron Swartz. Posted by New York Times, 19 July 2011. Retrieved 20 May 2013. Background On January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by MIT Police on state breaking-and-entering charges, in connection with the systematic downloading of academic journal articles from JSTOR. Federal prosecutors eventually charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, charges carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines plus 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution and supervised release. On January 11, 2013, two years after his initial arrest, Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself. JSTOR is a digital repository that archives ‚àí and disseminates online ‚àí manuscripts, GIS systems, scanned plant specimens and content from academic journal articles. Swartz was a research fellow at Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account. Visitors to MIT's \\"open campus\\" were authorized to access JSTOR through its network.Granick, Jennifer, Towards Learning from Losing Aaron Swartz: Part 2, The Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School blog, 15 January 2013. Retrieved 26 January 2013. According to state and federal authorities, Swartz downloaded a large number of academic journal articles from JSTOR through MIT's computer network, over the course of a few weeks in late 2010 and early 2011. They said Swartz downloaded the documents to a laptop computer connected to a networking switch in a controlled-access wiring closet. According to press reports, the door to the closet was kept unlocked.

He was arraigned in Cambridge District Court on two state charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. On July 11, 2011, Swartz was indicted in federal District Court on four felony counts: wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer and recklessly damaging a protected computer.Kao, Joanna The Tech‚Äôs coverage of Aaron Swartz The Tech, 12 January 2013.

On December 16, 2011, the district attorney's office filed a nolle prosequi declaration in the case generated by Swartz's initial January 6, 2011 arrest. The state charges against Swartz stemming from the November 17, 2011 indictment were dropped on March 8, 2012.Hawkinson, John State drops charges against Swartz; federal charges remain The Tech, 16 March 2012. Retrieved 14 May 2013. According to a spokesperson for the Middlesex County prosecutor, the state charges were dropped in order to permit federal prosecution to proceed, unimpeded. A report later submitted to the president of MIT about the Swartz case suggests, however, that Massachusetts state law required the Middlesex district attorney to dismiss the charges after the Boston U.S. Attorneys' Office and the Secret Service failed to promptly hand over evidence requested by Swartz's attorney during the Massachusetts case's discovery process. Writing in Massachusetts Lawyers' Weekly, Harvey Silverglate reported that lawyers familiar with the original case told him they had expected it to be dismissed after a \\"'continuance without a finding' ... The charge [would be] held in abeyance ... without any verdict ... for a period of a few months up to maybe a couple of years.\\" After the publication of his Massachusetts Lawyers' Weekly piece, Silverglate explained to CNET's Declan McCullagh that if the defendant manages to stay out of further legal trouble after such a continuance, the case is typically dismissed.McCullagh, Declan, Swartz didn't face prison until feds took over case, report says, cnet, 25 January 2013. Retrieved 7 February 2013. \\"Tragedy intervened,\\" Silverglate had written, \\"when [U.S. Attorney Carmen] Ortiz's office took over the case to 'send a message.'\\" According to Verge reporter Jeff Blagdon and the Huffington Post, federal rather than local prosecutors had been \\"calling the shots\\" on the prosecution of the case since Swartz's arrest.

Heymann's > involvement in the case had commenced very early in the investigation. Federal prosecution On April 13, 2011, as part of their investigation, federal authorities interviewed Swartz's former partner, Wired journalist Quinn Norton; she penned an article, \\"Life Inside the Aaron Swartz Investigation,\\" detailing her experiences in the case. > I mentioned ... a two-year-old public post on ...

I told them about the Guerilla > Open Access Manifesto. And in doing so, Aaron would explain to me later (and > reporters would confirm), I made everything worse. On July 19, 2011, the July 11th federal indictment was unsealed, charging Swartz with two counts of fraud and two counts related to accessing and damaging a protected computer. According to the indictment, Swartz surreptitiously attached a laptop to MIT's computer network, which ran a script named \\"keepgrabbing.py\\", allowing him to \\"rapidly download an extraordinary volume of articles from JSTOR.\\" Prosecutors in the case said Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on P2P file- sharing sites. Swartz surrendered to authorities, pleading not guilty on all counts, and was released on $100,000 unsecured bail. After his arrest, JSTOR released a statement saying that though it considered Swartz's access to be a \\"significant misuse\\" committed in an \\"unauthorized fashion,\\" it would not pursue civil litigation against him; MIT did not comment on the proceedings. The New York Times wrote of the case: \\"a respected Harvard researcher who also is an Internet folk hero has been arrested in Boston on charges related to computer hacking, which are based on allegations that he downloaded articles that he was entitled to get free.\\" The Awl similarly commented that \\"Swartz is being charged with hacker crimes, not copyright-infringement crimes, because he didn't actually distribute any documents, plus JSTOR didn't even want him prosecuted.\\" Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen Heymann and Scott Garland were the lead prosecutors, working under the supervision of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz. The case was brought under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which was passed in 1986 to enhance the government's ability to prosecute hackers who accessed computers to steal information or to disrupt or destroy computer functionality. \\"If convicted on these charges,\\" said Ortiz, \\"Swartz faces up to 35 years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, restitution, forfeiture and a fine of up to $1 million.\\" On September 12, 2012, the prosecution filed a superseding indictment adding nine more felony counts. George Washington University Law School Professor Orin Kerr, writing on the legal blog Volokh Conspiracy, opined that the risk of a maximum sentence in Swartz's case was not high. In an interview with Boston's WBUR, retired federal judge Nancy Gertner said a sentence of 35 years for a case like Swartz's \\"never occurs.\\" She questioned the propriety of pressing these charges at all. Referring to decision-making by Ortiz's office, she said \\"this is the example of bad judgment I saw too often,\\" suggesting that a two-year diversion program leading to expunged charges would have been more fitting. =Plea negotiations= Swartz's attorney, Elliot Peters, stated that prosecutors at one point offered a plea deal of four months in prison and pleading guilty to 13 charges, and warned that if Swartz rejected the deal, future deals would be less attractive; and that two days before Swartz's death, that \\"Swartz would have to spend six months in prison and plead guilty to 13 charges if he wanted to avoid going to trial.\\" Under the six-month deal, after Swartz pled guilty to the 13 charges, the government would have argued for a six-month sentence, and Swartz would have argued for a lesser sentence; the judge would then be free to assign whatever sentence the judge thought appropriate, up to six months. Peters later filed a complaint with the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, stating that if Swartz didn't plead guilty, Heymann \\"threatened that he would seek for Mr. Swartz to serve seven years in prison,\\" a difference in duration Peters asserts went \\"far beyond\\" the disparity encouraged by the plea-bargain portion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Andy Good, Swartz's initial lawyer, told The Boston Globe: \\"I told Heymann the kid was a suicide risk. His reaction was a standard reaction in that office, not unique to Steve. He said, 'Fine, we'll lock him up.' I'm not saying they made Aaron kill himself. Aaron might have done this anyway. I'm saying they were aware of the risk, and they were heedless.\\" Marty Weinberg, who took the case over from Good, said he nearly negotiated a plea bargain in which Swartz would not serve any time. \\"JSTOR signed off on it,\\" he said, \\"but MIT would not.\\" Two days before his death, JSTOR announced on January 9, 2013 that it would make \\"more than 4.5 million articles\\" available to the public free of charge. The \\"Register & Read\\" service, in beta for the previous 10 months, was capped at three articles every two weeks (78 per year), readable online only, with some downloadable for a fee. After his death, Ortiz's office dismissed the charges against Swartz. She said, \\"This office's conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case ... This office sought an appropriate sentence that matched the alleged conduct‚Äîa sentence that we would recommend to the judge of six months in a low security setting ... At no time did this office ever seek‚Äîor ever tell Mr. Swartz's attorneys that it intended to seek‚Äîmaximum penalties under the law.\\" On January 12, 2013, Alex Stamos, a computer forensics investigator employed by the Swartz legal defense team, posted an online summary of the expert testimony he had been prepared to present in the JSTOR case, had Swartz lived to see trial. He wrote: > If I had taken the stand as planned and had been asked by the prosecutor > whether Aaron's actions were \\"wrong,\\" I would probably have replied that > what Aaron did would better be described as \\"inconsiderate.\\" In the same way > it is inconsiderate ... to check out every book at the library needed for a > History 101 paper. It is inconsiderate to download lots of files on shared > wifi ... =Federal prosecutory rationale and responses = U.S. Attorney Ortiz asserted after the 2011 indictment that \\"stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim, whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.\\"Was Aaron Swartz Stealing? - The Awl About the prosecution At a January 24, 2013 memorial for Swartz, Carl Malamud recalled their work with PACER. He noted that they had brought millions of U.S. District Court records out from behind PACER's \\"pay wall\\" and found them full of privacy violations. > We sent our results to the Chief Judges of 31 District Courts ...

Was the merciless JSTOR prosecution the revenge of embarrassed bureaucrats because they looked stupid in the New York Times, because the U.S. Senate called them on the carpet?\\" Former Nixon White House counsel John Dean wrote an article on the legal blog justia.com entitled Dealing With Aaron Swartz in the Nixonian Tradition: Overzealous Overcharging Leads to a Tragic Result, saying \\"these are not people who are conscientiously and fairly upholding our federal laws. Rather, they are typically authoritarian personalities who get their jollies from shamelessly beating up on unfortunate people like Aaron Swartz.\\" George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr wrote on January 15, 2013 that \\"the charges brought here were pretty much what any good federal prosecutor would have charged.\\" Duke University law professor James Boyle replied in The Huffington Post: \\"I think that in [Kerr's] descriptions of the facts [and of] the issues surrounding prosecutorial discretion ... he tends ... to minimize or ignore facts that might put [Swartz] in a more favorable light.\\" In response to a piece by Larissa MacFarquhar in the New Yorker, retired journalist Jane Scholz objected to what she perceived as an effort \\"to turn Swartz into a hero for facing government prosecution after hacking the JSTOR archive\\", arguing that \\"Swartz was apparently familiar with laws protecting proprietary-information- management systems, so he should not have been surprised by the severity of the prosecution's response to his crime. It is a crime, and not a victimless one. I am a retired journalist; during my working years, my salary depended, and today my pension relies, on people paying for copyrighted content. In recent years, as the business that supports journalism has declined, thousands of journalists have lost pay, benefits, and, ultimately, their jobs. [ ... ] I find it ironic that Swartz made several million dollars selling the rights to his own copyrighted programming to Conde Nast. Swartz's is a sad story, but it's not a heroic one.\\" Law professor Mike Maddison commented on Scholz's letter: \\"it is difficult to find a better example of the glib equation of 'my career isn't the success that it once was' and 'somebody committed a crime' that infects contemporary dialogues about IP rights.\\"Copyright Crime: The Legacy of Aaron Swartz  madisonian.net David Aaronovitch noted in The Times that JSTOR was itself a \\"product of philanthropy\\" but that it had to charge access fees so that it could pay academic publishers for rights to their publications. He decried the \\"reckless\\" behavior of a generation which \\"cannot be persuaded‚Äîyet‚Äîthat copyright matters\\". In contrast, Peter Ludlow in The Chronicle of Higher Education argued that due to the publish or perish nature of academia and the importance that journals' reputations have, \\"[w]hen an academic signs away copyright to an academic publisher, it amounts to a 'contract of adhesion'‚Äîmeaning a contract in which one party has all the power and it was not freely bargained\\" and that \\"like the original authors, JSTOR had to negotiate its licensing agreements from a position of weakness\\", which Ludlow illustrated with a bargaining agreement from JSTOR's history, which stipulated that the publishers \\"be compensated if there was a loss to their (minimal) sales of rights to older materials, and they demanded compensation even before JSTOR covered its own expenses\\". Ludlow concluded that \\"Until academics get their acts together and start using new modes of publication, we need to recognize that actions like Aaron Swartz's civil disobedience are legitimate.\\"Aaron Swartz Was Right - The Chronicle Review - The Chronicle of Higher Education Rob Weir, who describes himself as an \\"associate editor of a very small journal\\", writes in Inside Higher Ed that \\"Many wonder why money accrues to those whose only 'creation' is to aggregate the labor of others, especially when some form of taxpayer money underwrote many of the articles. That's a legitimate concern, but defending Swartz's method elevates vigilantism above the rules of law and reason.\\" While he concedes that \\"JSTOR charges university libraries a king's ransom for its services\\", he also argues that \\"even a modest journal is expensive to produce\\" and that \\"if you want anyone to read your journal, you'll give it to JSTOR or some other aggregator. Unless, of course, you can drum up lots of free advertising\\". He concludes that the \\"information wants to be free\\" adage fails to account for the \\"hidden costs within the culture of free\\", and proposes that \\"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch\\" is the appropriate summary of production costs in the Information Age, which he transmutes to \\"if you can't do the time, don't do the crime\\" for \\"hackers and info thieves\\".Essay argues that Aaron Swartz was wrong  Inside Higher Ed Tim Wu, writing in The New Yorker, called out what he perceived as lack of proportionality, writing that \\"The act was harmless ‚Äî [ ... ] meaning that there was no actual physical harm, nor actual economic harm. The leak was found and plugged; JSTOR suffered no actual economic loss. It did not press charges. Like a pie in the face, Swartz's act was annoying to its victim, but of no lasting consequence.\\"Will Aaron Swartz's suicide spark copyright reform? - The Week Wu went on to compare Swartz's act with that of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who, according to Wu, \\"in the nineteen- seventies, committed crimes similar to, but more economically damaging than, Swartz's. Those two men hacked AT&T;'s telephone system to make free long- distance calls, and actually sold the illegal devices (blue boxes) to make cash. Their mentor, John Draper, did go to jail for a few months (where he wrote one of the world's first word processors), but Jobs and Wozniak were never prosecuted. Instead, they got bored of phreaking and built a computer. The great ones almost always operate at the edge\\" writes Wu, in support of this thesis that \\"We can rightly judge a society by how it treats its eccentrics and deviant geniuses‚Äîand by that measure, we have utterly failed [in the case of Swartz].\\"How the Legal System Failed Aaron Swartz-and Us : The New Yorker About the law After Boyle's Huffington Post column, Kerr returned to the topic, advocating reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) under which Swartz was prosecuted. \\"The problem raised by the Swartz case is ‚Ä¶ [that] felony liability under the statute is triggered much too easily. The law needs to draw a distinction between low-level crimes and more serious crimes, and current law does so poorly‚Ä¶\\"Kerr, Oren, Aaron‚Äôs Law, Drafting the Best Limits of the CFAA, And A Reader Poll on A Few Examples Volokh Conspiracy, 27 January 2013. Retrieved 23 April 2013. Chris Soghoian, a technology policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, argued similarly, \\"Existing laws don't recognise the distinction between two types of computer crimes: malicious crimes committed for profit ... and cases where hackers break into systems to prove their skillfulness or spread information that they think should be available to the public.\\" Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, both defended Swartz and challenged the scope of the law under which he was prosecuted. Law professor Stephen L. Carter agrees that the prosecution of Swartz was ridiculous, but also lays the blame on Congress for creating a new type of federal felony roughly every week.CBA National Magazine - Copyright and \\"I'm right to nuke you\\" ethics Carter considers that the CFAA is a good example of this phenomenon. He writes: \\"Enacted in the 1980s, before the Internet explosion, the statute makes a criminal of anyone who 'intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access' and, in the process, obtains financial information, government information or 'information from any protected computer. Carter then gives the following example: \\"You're sitting in your office, when suddenly you remember that you forgot to pay your Visa bill. You take a moment to log on to your bank account, and you pay the bill. Then you go back to work. If your employer has a policy prohibiting personal use of office computers, then you have exceeded your authorized access; since you went to your bank website, you have obtained financial information. Believe it or not, you're now a felon. The likelihood of prosecution might be small, but you've still committed a crime.\\" Carter further writes that the problem with the statute was well-known, and that \\"some federal courts have given the statute's language a narrow construction, but others have read it broadly, and the Obama administration has opposed efforts in Congress to narrow its scope. Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, warned in an opinion last spring [of 2012] the government's position 'would make criminals of large groups of people who would have little reason to suspect they are committing a federal crime. In 2013, Zoe Lofgren and Ron Wyden have advanced a legislative proposal called \\"Aaron's Law\\" to amend the CFAA in order to eliminate the aforementioned vagueness and also eliminate the \\"redundant provisions that enable a person to be punished multiple times ‚Ä¶ for the same crime\\". In an opinion piece for Wired magazine, they wrote that \\"This is, in fact, what happened to Aaron Swartz ‚Äî more than a third of the charges in the superseding indictment against him were under this redundant CFAA provision.\\"Lofgren, Zoe and Ron Wyden, Introducing Aaron‚Äôs Law, a Desperately Needed Reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Wired, 20 June 2013.

They said Heymann \\"may have misrepresented to the Court the extent of the federal government's [early] involvement in the investigation.\\" > Emails and reports further illustrated ... that AUSA Heymann was himself > involved in the investigation even before Mr. Swartz was arrested on January > 6, 2011.

On March 15, the lawyers asked the federal court to modify the protective order on Swartz's file to permit public disclosure of the discovery materials, including the names and titles of MIT, JSTOR and law enforcement employees. The lawyers said that withholding the names would make the documents \\"less intelligible and thus far less useful to Congress.\\" The First Assistant U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, Jack Pirozzolo, said he was taking a role in the discussions and would be asking the court to give the affected employees an opportunity to be heard on the proposed disclosures. The Department of Justice sought to redact the names of the prosecutors involved in the case. On April 3, 2013, a U.S. Attorney's Office spokesperson said, \\"Our argument against it is that not only does it have an effect on the people involved in the case, but there's also sometimes a residual effect.\\" The Attorney's Office reported threats and hacking attempts against prosecutors already known to be involved: \\"threatening emails\\" received by Ortiz and Heymann, the hacking of Heymann's Facebook account and that \\"Heymann's father, a Harvard professor, received a postcard with his photo in a guillotine\\". The postcard and some email excerpts were published by Wired magazine. On May 13, 2013, the court granted the estate's motion in part, permitting public disclosure of much of the material the estate's lawyers had sought to have unsealed, provided that the names of MIT and government employees were first redacted. The estate's argument for disclosure of these names was \\"substantially outweighed by the interest of the government and the victims in shielding their employees from potential retaliation,\\" wrote Judge Nathaniel Gorton. The judge also ruled that information disclosing details of computer network security at MIT should not be made public.Mullin, Joe Aaron Swartz prosecutors will unseal evidence, but won‚Äôt name names 13 May 2013, arstechnica.

Kevin Poulsen filed a FOIA lawsuit and in November 2013 obtained the release of 130 pages from the file that the US Secret Service has on Swartz, out of approximately 20,000 pages that the agency has in relation to Swartz. Of Heymann, BuzzFeed has noted: \\"Back in 2008, young hacker Jonathan James killed himself in the midst of a federal investigation led by the same prosecutor.\\" In January 2013, WikiLeaks claimed through its Twitter account that Swartz had been in contact with Julian Assange through 2010 and 2011, and that Swartz may have been a source of leaked materials. If true, this would offer an explanation as to why charges against Swartz were pursued by the federal government despite JSTOR dropping charges and urging that the government and MIT do the same.

During his work at the Academy of Sciences, he participated actively in the work of the Committee for Aeronautics, the Environment Protection Committee, the Energy Committee and the Astronautics Committee. Much of his work, M. Nenadovic dedicated to scientific research and theoretical and experimental study of the aerodynamic design of aircraft, including construction of aircraft while also taking interest in equipment for aerodynamic testing and the influence of wind on the building structures. Research projects After World War I, industrialization began in Yugoslavia, which had previously been a predominantly agricultural country with somewhat developed light industries. As early as 1923, the first aircraft factory \\"Ikarus\\" was founde in Novi Sad in 1924. Rogozarski was established in Belgrade and in 1927 a Zemun-based company Zmaj \\" and Brege in Kraljevo took shape. The first aircraft engine factory called ‚ÄúVlajkovic and Comp‚Äù was founded in Belgrade, while as early as 1929 an aircraft engine factory began operating in Rakovica near Belgrade. A factory for optics and precise mechanics \\"Teleoptik\\" from Zemun which was founded in 1923, changed its product range and in 1928 went on to be mainly engaged in manufacturing aeronautical instruments and equipment. This was followed by the founding of new factories for precise mechanics \\"Mikron\\" in 1930 and \\"Nestor\\" in 1938. The initial production in these factories focused on aircraft and equipment by foreign licenses, thus helping bridge the technological gap between the developed countries and Yugoslav. At that time, the Yugoslav industry was not producing a single steam turbine, water turbine, tractor, agricultural machine, not even a bicycle, yet it was making an aircraft which at the time was one of the most complex mechanical systems as well as locomotives. For the first aircraft Hansa-Brandenburg B.I and Hansa-Brandenburg C.I,digital.nb.rs/scc/browse.php?collection=no-politika‚Ñ¥=DI&page;=10 the Ministry of the Army and Navy (MViM) placed at the disposal the technical documentation for these aircraft, created by engineer Rudolf Fizir, (Hansa- Brandenburg B.I to Ikarus, Hansa-Brandenburg C.I to Rogozarski factory) to aircraft factories which at the beginning of their work was invaluable. As for the staff, the first aerospace engineers were educated abroad, and in 1937 the Aeronautics Group at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University in Belgrade was established. The third part of the problem was the organization of research in this area because it was necessary to enable the local aircraft industry to carry out aerodynamic tests of its own home-made aircraft in their home country, as it was an established practice for aircraft models to be tested in aerospace institutes abroad. After Professor Nenadovic returned from his studies in France, he undertook the painstaking work of creating the material basis for aerodynamic testing. The idea for project of Aerotechnical Institute near Belgrade was drafted, and in 1939/40 projects had already been finished. However, with the invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, all such research. The organization of scientific research in this field in our country came to a halt. The conditions for the continuation of these activities came to be fulfilled after the liberation of the country when prof. Nenadovic and his associates formed the Aerotechnical institute within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. The equipment designed by prof. Nenadovic and his associates is divided into two groups: wind tunnels and other aerospace equipment.–ù–µ–Ω–∞–¥–æ–≤–∏—õ, –ú–∏—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤ (1967.)

From 1938 to the beginning of WWII, in addition to the regular duties at the Faculty of Engineering, he was a regular associate to airplane factories: \\"Utva\\", \\"Rogozarski\\", \\"Ikarus\\" and \\"Vistad\\". Following the end of the war in 1945, he founded the Institute of Mechanical Engineering, at the Faculty of Technical Engineering, jointly with several laboratories that contributed to the renewal of faculty labs destroyed during the Second World War. After the reorganization of the University and Technical College, and following the establishment of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, the Institute of Mechanical Engineering was transformed into a research facility, later turned into the Bureau for Machines and Tools, at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, as well as other workshops for maintenance.–í–µ—Å–æ–≤–∏—õ, –ú; –î. –ü–æ–ø–æ–≤–∏—õ (1973.)

Along with the restoration of the Faculty Mechanical Engineering following liberation, Professor Nenadovic continued his activities in the field of scientific research programs, including the development of the Yugoslav Air Force in collaboration with such institutions as the Directorate of the Aviation Industry, VTI, the Mostar-based plane and helicopter factory \\"Soko\\", Air Force Technical Institute in Zarkovo and other companies engaged in the production or manufacture of aircraft or production for aviation‚Äôs needs. Together with his associates, professor Nenandovic founded Institute of Aerospace Technology at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. As the founder of the Institute, he established a number of laboratories, the equipment for the laboratories was designed and developed by the members of the Institute Professor under the mentorship of professor Nenadovic. Thanks to this equipment, various experiments are conducted at the Institute and lectures in various fields of aerospace technology and related disciplines. In this way professor Nenadovic together with his colleagues laid a solid foundation for modern teaching thus educating young experts the Yugoslav aviation needed so much. In 1951 he was elected full-tenured professor, in the Aerospace Engineering Department, of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, while in the period from 1956 to 1959 he was Dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. As dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering he gave enormous contribution to completing the experimental part of teaching, establishing and equipping laboratories the newly built Faculty building needed. During his tenure, a new building of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering was completed with facilities and labs for wind tunnels with complete infrastructure. Professor Nenadovic loved his students and they loved him, and out of favor they called him \\"Uncle Misha\\", to which he always replied by calling them \\"my children,\\". Another interesting bit of information was that everyone in SANU, both his fellow academicians and staff called him by his nickname \\"Miro\\". Books Prof. M. Nenadovic was a prolific author and he published many scientific papers in national and international journals, while also authoring papers that were never published, but were part of internal communications of the Aerotechnical institutes including military and government institutions. Furthermore, he wrote several books most of which are used as university textbooks, some of them had several editions and are used to this day. # # # # # # # # # He worked extensively on the development of encyclopedias, as an for aerospace technology within the Technical Encyclopedia of the Yugoslav Institute of Lexigraphy, was a member of the Editorial Board of the Bulletin of the SASA, editor of Mechanical Engineering Gazette and a member of the Standing Subcommittee for Scientific Information, Publications and Documents of the Republic Research Association.–°–ê–ù–£ (1975.) –ì–æ–¥–∏—à—ö–∞–∫ LXXIX –∑–∞ 1972. –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥: –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—ò–∞ –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –£–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. pp. 731 - 732.

The China anti-Japanese demonstrations of 2012 or () were a series of demonstrations held across major cities in China and Taiwan during August and September 2012. The main cause of the demonstrations was the escalation of the Senkaku Islands dispute (Senkaku islands known as Diaoyu in China) between China and Japan around the time of the anniversary of the Mukden Incident of 1931, which was the de facto catalyst to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, culminating in a humiliating Chinese defeat and a decisive Japanese victory vis-√†-vis total consolidation and annexation of Manchuria. Protesters in several cities later became violent and local authorities began arresting demonstrators and banning the demonstrations. Background Anti Japanese protest in Xi'an on October 20, 2010.(2010Âπ¥‰∏≠ÂõΩÂèçÊó•Á§∫Â®ÅÊ¥ªÂä®) The Senkaku Islands (in Japanese; Diaoyu Islands in Chinese, and Diaoyutai Islands in Taiwanese) are offshore islands near Taiwan, and have been a subject of territorial dispute between the governments of the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China and Japan. Prior to the demonstrations, there were many cases of protests over the sovereignty of the islands, most notably those in China in 2005. September 18 marks the anniversary of the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the memories of which fuel anti-Japanese sentiment in China. After the 2010 Senkaku boat collision incident, China stopped exporting rare earths to Japan. =Incidents leading up to the protests= Japanese and Taiwanese coast guards stood face to face on July 4, 2012. On 16 April 2012, Tokyo's prefectural governor Shintaro Ishihara publicly announced his decision to let Tokyo Municipality purchase the island from its private owner. On 4 July 2012, three Japanese coast guard boats made an official inspection of one Taiwanese ship near the disputed island. After the inspection, Japanese coast guard and Taiwanese coast guard stood face to face. On 7 July 2012, Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda expressed his consideration for the Japanese government to buy the disputed islands. The Chinese government angrily protested; Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin retorted \\"No one will ever be permitted to buy and sell China's sacred territory\\". On 15 August 2012, activists from Hong Kong sailed to, and landed on one of the disputed islands, but were stopped by the Japan Coast Guard. Seven activists jumped from the ships to swim ashore, five of whom reached the island; the other two turned back to the ships. The activists and their ship were detained by Japanese authorities. The detained activists were deported two days later. First wave of protests Anti-Japanese demonstrations in Nanjing on 16 September, filmed at Zhongyang Road.

In Beijing, citizens began protesting in front of the Japanese embassy on 15 August. On the morning of 19 August, a crowd gathered and held placards bearing phrases such as \\"Return us the Diaoyu Islands\\" and \\"Japan must confess her crimes\\" in protest. In Shenzhen, protesters marched down the streets chanting slogans such as \\"Defend the Diaoyu Islands\\" and \\"Smash Japanese Imperialism\\", called for the boycott of Japanese goods and for the government to retake the islands. In the process, many protesters tore up Japanese flags and smashed Japanese-branded cars and vandalized shops selling Japanese goods; rocks were hurled at a Ramen shop. The protests lasted till about 2pm. According to Sing Tao Daily, the government sent in large numbers of armed police, who called for an end to the violent protests, began driving the protesters away and detaining several over-reacting protesters. On 14 September, the Shenzhen Police detained 4 protesters for violating private property rights by deliberately smashing roadside cars. The anti-Japanese protests were occasionally exploited by protesters who sought to criticize the Chinese government. Such demonstrations included marching with posters of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong‚Äîperceived to be more assertive on issues of sovereignty than current leaders, as well as signs about corruption, food safety, and income inequality. Supporters of the ousted anti-capitalist leader Bo Xilai also had a showing during the protests. There were also protests of varied intensities in other major cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Chengdu and Hangzhou. There were police officers maintaining order at the scenes to prevent incidents of violence. =Reactions= China *On 19 August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strongly protested to the Japanese Ambassador to China. Spokesperson Qin Gang expressed, with regards to the landing of Japanese activists on the disputed islands, that such illegal action is a breach of Chinese territorial sovereignty and that Japan should handle current actions appropriately to avoid stirring up bilateral relations. *On 20 August, the Fujian provincial government decided to delay commemoration activities held with the Japanese Okinawa prefecture, citing current unsuitable atmosphere for such celebrations in the country. The activities were originally scheduled for 4 September. Japan *On 19 August, Vice Foreign Minister Ken'ichir≈ç Sasae expressed that the protests made by China are \\"unacceptable\\" and voiced regret over anti-Japanese protests in China. *On 20 August, the 10 Japanese activists who landed on the disputed islands were prosecuted for law-breaking and put under trial by the Okinawan police. *On 20 August, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told a news conference that \\"Both countries do not want the Senkaku issue to affect overall bilateral ties. The Sino-Japanese relationship is one of the most important bilateral ties for Japan, and it is indispensable for the stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region for China to play a constructive role\\". *On 20 August, the ruling Democratic Party of Japan proposed to the government to take appropriate actions to prevent incidents of detaining activists from recurring. Media comments *China Youth Daily commented that the protests occurred as a result of wrongful attitude and actions on Japan's part, which had \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\". It claimed that the boycott of Japanese products is a sharp stand to \\"express the inviolable dignity of the Chinese people\\", and denounced instances of beating and smashing. *BBC correspondent in Beijing Martin Patience claims that the protests were \\"almost certainly sanctioned by the Chinese authorities\\" and that the government frequently used anti-Japanese sentiment to \\"deflect criticism of their rule\\" in the past. *CNN expresses that \\"both nations would benefit from resolving the dispute quickly, with China facing a leadership change later in the year and Japan facing separate territorial fights with Seoul and Moscow\\". *Reuters remarked that the anti-Japanese protests \\"reflect bitter Chinese memories of Japan's occupation of large parts of China in the 1930s and 1940s.\\" Second wave of protests Anti Japanese protesters hurled ink bottles at the wall of the Japanese Consulate-General in Shenyang, China on September 18, 2012.

Crackdown Japanese devils\\" and \\"little Japan\\" to \\"get out\\" of the disputed islands following the escalation in disputes in 2012. On 17 September, police in the city of Xi'an banned large protests and forbade the use of phone and online messages to organize illegal protests. For the duration of the week, paramilitary troops in Shanghai provided round-the-clock protection to the Japanese consulate, stripping demonstrators of projectiles, warning them against violence with megaphones, and limiting demonstrators' time at the site to a few minutes. On September 18, police in Qingdao city arrested six people for violent acts in connection with the demonstrations.

The characters of J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) and John Ross Ewing (Josh Henderson) feature heavily in Marta's storyline. Marta partners with the duo and they attempt to steal the Southfork Ranch from Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy). Marta falls in love with John Ross and Varela said that it is one of Marta's more genuine moments. But she believed that John Ross would never be able to maintain the same respect for her. With similar personalities they are well matched; but John Ross' relationship with Elena Ramos (Jordana Brewster) causes Marta to become jealous and obsessive. Varela's departure was announced in July 2012. Marta was murdered and John Ross wrongly accused of the crime. Varela's casting was announced in July 2011. She wanted to join the show because the legacy it had created. She thought Marta was to be an environmentalist and do- gooder, but she soon learned that Dallas writers had created a manipulative villain. Varela has stated that her character is not one-dimensional and is complex with both strengths and weaknesses. Marta also has bipolar disorder and Varela researched the condition via vlogs and movies. She decided that a \\"subtle nuance\\" of the illness better suited Marta. Cynthia Cidre, who produced and wrote for Dallas created an \\"in-depth background\\" for the character. This and Marta's villain status helped gain Varela more freedom in her portrayal. Various critics have analysed the character's mental state. Most have concluded that Marta is a \\"crazy\\" character. Digital Spy's Alex Fletcher opined that Marta became more \\"dark and ludicrously disturbing\\" with each episode. Terry Linwood from D Magazine called her an \\"all-around psycho\\" and bunny boiler. But Jarett Wieselman from Entertainment Tonight said that Marta epitomised Dallas key themes of \\"shocking revelations, devious double- crosses and smoking hot stars\\". Casting Leonor Varela (pictured) was attracted to the \\"Dallas legacy\\" when she auditioned for Marta.Varela's casting was announced in July 2011. She had already filmed the pilot episode of the series and was surprised by the outcome. During the audition process the actress had to \\"fight\\" for the role. Varela was attracted to the role because she believed that Dallas was \\"legendary\\" and had a \\"legacy\\". While interviewed for La Segunda she said that the show's production company Warner Bros. Television and the broadcaster TNT had to both approve of her casting before it was finalised. Character development =Characterization= Marta was originally meant to be an environmentalist and fill the role of opposition to the Ewing's plans to drill for oil on the Southfork Ranch. Varela told a writer from El Mercurio that \\"Marta is a sophisticated woman, educated, smart and professional. Immediately I identified with her.\\" She added that she would find her own life experiences useful while playing Marta. When Varela auditioned for the role she was unaware that the writers had planned for Marta to be manipulative. She told Gabrielle Chung of Celebuzz that the writers had been \\"sneaky bastards\\" and not told her how the storyline would develop. As Varela told La Segunda's writer, Marta had been developed in a different way to what she had expected. She had to create and interpret a character that was \\"very different\\" and far removed from herself. But she enjoyed it more because Marta is a not one dimensional, she is \\"complex, has strengths and weaknesses\\". Varela did find certain scenes involving Marta's scenes difficult. She did not reveal specific details because she felt that it would ruin the viewing experience as Marta brings \\"intrigue, suspense and surprises\\" to Dallas. In Marta's backstory men had emotionally hurt her - but as Valera noted ‚ÄúI think Marta is a woman that has been through a lot. She has seen it all and has been played with too many times to be played again. She‚Äôs a tough cookie!\\" Marta is a loose cannon, nearly capable of anything with flexible ethics and morality. She is ruthless, emotional and unstable which creates a dangerous combination of traits. A character with a range of \\"little intricacies and instabilities\\" left Varela shocked. But she was delighted with the freedom that came with portraying an unstable character. Cynthia Cidre, who produced and wrote for Dallas created an \\"in-depth background\\" for Marta which helped Varela. Marta gains notoriety as the villain of the first season and she told Carolina Cerda Maira from Latercera that it was fun. Even more fun and entertaining was not working within the \\"classical canons of good\\" and playing a Dallas villain with a \\"touch of madness\\". She noted that Marta was not a caricature and suffered from bipolar disorder. To research the condition Varela studied the condition from a \\"clinical standpoint\\". She also watched movies with bipolar protagonist such as Mr. Jones. Viewing YouTube vlogs of young people with the condition's \\"highs (mania) and lows (depression)\\" helped her to understand that there was \\"a very large range of this disease\\". As a result Varela decided to portray a \\"subtle nuance\\" of the illness because she felt it was more \\"believable\\" for Marta. =Involvement with J.R. and John Ross Ewing= In December 2011, a photograph released via the Associated Press revealed that Varela was filming alongside Larry Hagman and Josh Henderson who play J.R. Ewing and John Ross Ewing respectively. Marta gets involved with John Ross and seduces him as part of her plan to secure the Southfork Ranch from the Ewing family. Varela told Chung that she was not nervous while filming sex scenes with Henderson. She felt in control and directed the logistics of the sex scene. She added that \\"It was just fun and you get to be very creative. All the stuff that‚Äôs there is just stuff from my twisted imagination.\\"Varela felt that Marta was more than a villain because \\"she is very ambitious in the sense that she can do what it takes to get the job done. At the same time, she also has a true weakness for John Ross Jr.\\" Varela explained that Marta's genuine feelings for John Ross made her more \\"relatable to as a character\\". Valera decided her character loved John Ross from the pilot episode when she makes a \\"truly genuine gesture\\" towards him. She believed that John Ross would not always give Marta the same respect and ultimately be her downfall. She told Danielle Turchiano from Examiner.com that Marta is \\"totally crazy\\" about John Ross because he has everything she wants. They are well matched and share \\"a ruthless way about them\\". They create a \\"warped sense of reality\\" because neither think of the consequences and she is bipolar. They also share the same goals which originally bring the pair together. In her dealings with the Ewing family, Marta steals the Southfork Ranch from Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy). She then helps John Ross in his attempts to con J.R. Marta begins taking pills and becomes more unstable over time. In one episode she manages to shock J.R. when he discovers she is not Marta Del Sol but an imposter. She told Jen Heger from Radar Online that \\"Marta will have to suffer the consequences for double crossing J.R. Ewing.\\" In July 2012, a reporter from the Toronto Sun said that Varela would be departing the series after Marta is killed following a fall from a balcony. Varela told Latercera's Cerda Maira that she always knew that Marta would only feature in the first seven episodes of the first season. But she did find it hard to say goodbye to Marta and her colleagues. She added that \\"I had grown fond of everyone and I had fun as both Veronica/Marta and did not want it to end. But everything has an end and so I could give way to another stage of my life, I am also happy to be alive.\\" Storylines Marta helps J.R. with a plan to reclaim control of Southfork and is introduced to his son John Ross. They begin to plot to remove J.R. from the deal. John Ross is upset that his relationship with Elena Ramos (Jordana Brewster) has ended and he goes back to Marta's hotel room for sex. She drugs him and records their sex session. She manages to convince Bobby to sell the ranch to her. J.R. goes to visit the Del Sol family who claim to be unaware of Marta's plans. He is introduced to the real Marta Del Sol and realizes he has been doing business with a fraud. Marta is revealed to be named \\"Veronica Martinez\\", but she carries on posing under her new identity. He warns Marta to never scam him again and lets her in on the new deal with Vicente Cano (Carlos Bernard). J.R. and Marta cut John Ross out of the new deal. J.R. discovers that Marta has a history of stalking men. Marta arranges a series of dates with John Ross but he does not turn up and spends time with Elena. Marta becomes angry and hands him the recording of them having sex. Marta begins to follow John Ross and Elena. She breaks into Elena's home and sticks a knife through a picture of John Ross and Elena kissing. John Ross asks Vicente for more time to meet an oil shipment deadline. In exchange he tells him that Marta has been stealing money from the deal and stalking him. He requests that Vincente attempt to get her to leave town. Marta follows Elena and steals her mobile phone. She calls John Ross and pretends that she has kidnapped Elena and in exchange for her freedom he has to meet with her. She bemoans John Ross for getting Vincente to go after her. She reveals that she has money and would like to leave with John Ross. He rebuffs her advances and during a fracas she scratches John Ross' neck. As he leaves two of Vincente's henchmen arrive and throw Marta off her balcony. As John Ross was seen leaving her room beforehand, he is charged with murder. Reception Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy described Marta as John Ross' \\"scheming partner in crime\\" and a Us Weekly columnist named her a \\"sexy villain\\". A reporter from The Huffington Post branded her a \\"villainous vixen\\". Access Hollywood's Jodie Lash said that Varela had been \\"heating up\\" the show as \\"the bad and mad girl who's been causing trouble for John Ross and his father, J.R. Ewing.\\" She added that Marta \\"really brings out the crazy\\" on John Ross. Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly described the character as \\"a woman with anger issues who's into bondage and filmed her sexcapade with John Ross.\\" She later opined mixing champagne and lithium in a revenge plot would come naturally to Marta and predicted that she would end up murdered. Terry Linwood from D Magazine called her an \\"all-around psycho\\", \\"psychohosebeast\\", \\"crazy\\" and a bunny boiler. Jarett Wieselman from Entertainment Tonight said that \\"Dallas was second-to-none when it came to shocking revelations, devious double-crosses and smoking hot stars. TNT's Dallas is picking up right where the original left off and rolling all of those attributes into one character: Leonor Varela's \\"Marta Del Sol.\\" A writer from the International Business Times said that Marta turned out to be \\"shady a character as anyone and could give those Ewing boys a run for their money.\\" A reporter from Inside Soap said that Marta had a history of \\"violence fuelled by jealousy\\" and was \\"as stable as a bucking bronco at the Southfork rodeo\\". Digital Spy's Fletcher held a similar opinion, naming her as John Ross' \\"psychotic bit on the side\\", \\"crazy former lover\\", \\"crazy eyed date raper\\" and a \\"crazy-eyed drug-sex woman\\". Fletcher stated that Marta became more \\"dark and ludicrously disturbing\\" as the series progressed. He predicted that she would be murdered by the end of the series. The writer concluded that \\"when not watching her own violent, druggy sex tapes, she's making threats to John Ross, doing some crazy-eye, head-wobbling manic acting and generally causing mayhem for the entire Southfork clan.\\" Vanessa Millones from Latina magazine also believed that Marta was crazy and lived up to the \\"Latina loca stereotype\\".

Plot The film opens with a man chasing another man. The chaser is Brick Bardo, who is investigating the death of his brother. He catches up to Davey, who attempts to fight him, resulting in Davey getting knocked out and being tied up to the ground in the boiling Sun. Brick interrogates Davey through torturous methods and tells him that Brick's brother was involved in a fixed kickboxing fight scheme, which resulted in his exile and eventual murder. Brick demands the name of the four people who are responsible for his brother's death. Davey names Brent Caldwell, Mike Johnson, Billy Munoz, and Connie Angel. Brick has a partner in Max, a woman who seduces Brent, now a middleweight champion, and after a session of lovemaking, knocks him out with ether. Brick calls Billy, a former kickboxing legend who is now working as a janitor. Brick tells Billy he has kidnapped his daughter to meet him in Las Vegas if he wants to see his daughter again. Mike, a former heavyweight champion, is on the run from three hoodlums. Mike attempts to fight them off unsuccessfully, after which Max arrives and rescues Mike from the thugs and offers to take him to Las Vegas. Connie is a successful businesswoman for the World Martial Arts Council who has been seeing another man behind her estranged husband's back and is only looking to get away from the council as a rich woman after the impending divorce. Brick shows up and beats up Connie's lover and confronts her. She attempts to fight him but fails with Brick knocking her out. At an abandoned arena in Las Vegas, Brent, Billy, Mike, and Connie are all tied up in front of a ring. Max wakes up the four and all four are shocked to learn about each other. They wonder why they are tied up and attempt to get loose. Connie remembers Wood Wilson, an old boyfriend who she defeated in a male vs female kickboxing match, and who is revealed to be Brick's brother. The four were asked to testify against Wood for fight fixing but their testimonies were later cancelled, with Brent vehemently denying that he was ever involved in anything involving Wood. Brick enters the ring and lets them in on what is happening. A recorded conversation reveals that Jack, a sports commissioner, was involved in fight fixing. Brick says that he killed Jack and makes a comment about Jack's partner Sam having a friend who set up Wood Wilson, leading to Wood's death. Brick intends to use the ring as his interrogation place, fighting each of the four until he gets answers. Mike is the first one to face Brick's interrogation. Brick makes the stipulations. If Mike wins, everyone goes free, but if Brick wins, Mike dies and the rest will continue to be interrogated. Mike attempts to fight hard, but Brick fights harder, and just when Mike is about to die, Billy stops him and offers to talk. Billy heads to the ring and demands to see his daughter. Brick tells Billy that his daughter has died. In a rage, Billy begins to fight Brick. At first getting the upper hand, Billy lets his emotions get the best of him. Brick tells Billy if he tells him who set Wood up, he will spare his son's life. Billy says he only received a letter but no name and Brick promises to kill Billy's son. Brick proceeds to break Billy's back, killing him. Brent is third in line for interrogation. As he makes his way to the ring, he attempts to pull a knife on Max, but has the gun pointed to him again. Brent enters the ring and Brick begins his interrogation, accusing Brent as the fight fixer. Brent once again denies it and promises not to say anything. Connie, still tied up, deciphers that Brent is the one who killed Wood Wilson. As Brick fights Brent, a barely breathing Mike crawls towards Connie and hands her the knife Brent had earlier. In the ring, an enraged Brick tells Brent, who is begging for his life, that Wood didn't beg for his life. When Brent asks how he knew, Brick reveals that he was there as well and kills Brent. When Max goes to retrieve Connie, Connie frees herself and throws the knife at Max, killing her. Brick finally reveals to Connie the whole truth. Brick is actually Wood Wilson. Connie doesn't believe it, but Brick confesses it all. He survived being viciously beaten by Brent five years ago and had his face changed through plastic surgery. Connie admits she was the mastermind behind the scheme in order to make enough money so she and Wood could escape together, but Wood didn't want to participate in her plan. Connie admits she was wrong for choosing money over her love for Wood. Brick/Wood tells Connie they have to fight and admits he hadn't really killed Billy's daughter, but has her hidden. If Connie wins, he will release Billy's daughter. Brick and Connie fight with Connie getting the upper hand and finally defeating Brick/Wood once again after Brick attempts to rape her. A kick to the chest on a downed Brick kills him. The next day, Connie is sitting in her office, awaiting to meet Billy's kids.

He writes on the history and philosophy of science and technology, and has in the past been an author on hedge funds, quantitative investing, and risk management. In his widely read blog as well as other media he frequently writes on issues concerning scientific developments, new technologies, and their meaning for society. In 2014, Jaeger published a universal history of science (in German), and in September 2016 a book on the interplay of science and spirituality (again in German). His next book \\"Supermacht Wissenschaften\\" (\\"Superpower Science\\", 2017, again in German) outlines scenarios of mankind's technological future. His latest book \\"The Second Quantum Revolution - From Entanglement to Quantum Computing and Other Super-Technologies\\" (2018, English as well as German editions) deals with the latest quantum technologies. His latest book \\"Mehr Zukunft wagen\\" (Daring more future\\", 2019, in German) is a confrontation with the impending technological upheavals that lead to what Jaeger calls ‚ÄúThe Human Crisis‚Äù. Jaeger has for many years been an influential voice in the hedge fund industry on fostering developments towards more transparency, liquidity, and cost efficiency. He is the founder and CEO of Alternative Beta Partners AG and currently serves GAM as Head of Alternative Risk Premia.  Background  Prior to founding Alternative Beta Partners in early 2010 Jaeger had served Partners Group as a partner for eight years. He is a co-founder of saisGroup, a hedge funds asset management firm, which merged into Partners Group in 2001. Jaeger started his finance career in 1997 at the quantitative research firm Olsen & Associates in Zurich. Before he studied physics and philosophy at the University of Bonn in Germany and √âcole Polytechnique in Paris and holds a doctorate degree in theoretical physics from the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, where he also performed post-doctoral studies in the field of non-linear dynamics.  Commentaries on hedge funds  Jaeger frequently comments in print, online, and on television on financial issues, particularly around hedge funds, their return sources and risk management for alternative investment strategies. \\"Interview Lars J√§ger - Schweizer Fernsehen: SF Videoportal\\" \\"Lars J√§ger √ºber die Eigendynamik der CDS - Schweizer Fernsehen: SF Videoportal\\" \\"Dr. Lars Jaeger on Hedge Fund Replication and Alternative Beta - Opalesque.TV Part 1\\" \\"Dr. Lars Jaeger on Hedge Fund Replication and Alternative Beta - Opalesque.TV Part 2\\" \\"Dr. Lars Jaeger on Hedge Fund Replication and Alternative Beta - Opalesque.TV Part 3\\" \\"Lars Jaeger on Wiley Finance \\" He has been an early public advocate for independent risk management, transparency, and cost reduction for hedge funds \\"2002 Article in IPE (pension fund magazine)\\"\\"2000 Article on risk management for hedge fund portfolios\\" \\"2002 Interview \\"\\"2006 Article in Garp Risk Review\\" having designed and run one of the first managed account platforms for these historically rather opaque investment structures in 2000.

The research by Jaeger such as \\"Factor Modeling and Benchmarking of Hedge Funds: Can passive investments in hedge funds strategies deliver?\\" initiated an industry wide discussion on the return attributes (and cost features) of hedge funds which starting in 2007 led to the appearance of hedge funds replication products and more recently to the growth of the \\"alternative risk premia\\" industry into a major investment topic of the global asset management industry. \\"Hedge Fund Indices: a new way to invest in alternative investment strategies?\\" \\"EDHEC on hedge fund replication\\" \\"Comments on hedge fund replication\\" Jaeger is author of several research articles in leading academic journals.

It connects the village of Dzongla () to the east and the village of Thagnak () to the west.  Tourism  The pass is on the Gokyo trail in the Khumbu Everest region. To the west the trail continues to the Gokyo Lakes, crossing the Ngozumpa glacier on the way. To the east the trail joins the Everest Base Camp trek. The pass can be physically demanding and may require crampons on top of the slippery glacier. The edge of the glacier is unstable.  Stay Safe  Cho La Pass can be crossed without a guide and without crampons, but you are advised to do your research before. Get up early (around 5 am) to make the crossing before mid-day and re-assess the hike when the weather turns bad. Snow can obscure the path across the glacier and erase foot tracks if you're trekking without a guide. Rock fall is another danger to consider, even in good weather. The trek is usually made from the town of Dzongla towards Thagnak as it is an easier climb. Most maps will tell you the glacier is on your right side. If you are crossing from Thagnak towards Dzongla, the glacier will be on your immediate left and can be obscured by snow. This route is very difficult even for fit trekkers as it is very steep and the terrain is made of loose rock, large boulders and ice. Stories are often shared in tea houses of deaths occurring on Cho La Pass, but very little official information on this is found online. In April 2017, a reported two people died while crossing Cho La Pass and one person (Aussie) was still missing.

Between 1865 and 1881, Sholl was the most senior government official and only judicial officer in North West Australia between the Murchison River and Timor Sea ‚Äì a jurisdiction known at the time as the North District.McCarthy, 2001, p33.

His headquarters at Roebourne was extremely isolated ‚Äì messages took weeks to travel between Sholl and his immediate superior, Frederick Barlee, Colonial Secretary of Western Australia.The Parliament of Western Australia was far less powerful at the time. While members of the Legislative Council ostensibly represented the North District sat from 1874, the Parliament's powers were highly limited until 1890, when responsible government was granted. Consequently, Sholl wielded considerable, de facto executive power;Sholl‚Äôs paid positions apart from Resident Magistrate were Sub-collector of Customs & Internal Revenue, as well as Registrar of Births, Deaths & Marriages. He was also expected to perform religious services for the Church of England, which was the official church in Western Australia at the time). (See also Sholl's preliminary instructions from the Colonial Secretary of Western Australia, Frederick Barlee, in the quotation box on this page.) an obituary in The West Australian described him as having been \\"virtually a Lieutenant Governor\\" of the North District. Family and early life The Sholl family originated in Cornwall and had strong ties to maritime industries, the armed forces, international trade, public office and medicine, in both England and Australia.William, Clement & Boase 1876, p46. William Sholl (1736‚Äì1797), RJ Sholl's paternal grandfather, was a Freeman (shareholder) of the Levant Company, represented it at ƒ∞skenderun (Alexandretta) in Turkey and was vice consul of both the UK and the Netherlands in that city;William, Clement & Boase, 1876, p46 and; Wilson, 2011, p40. (At the time, the rare, alternate title of \\"Factor Marine\\" was given to the British Vice-Consul at Scanderoon (as ƒ∞skenderun/Alexandretta was known in English at the time). He married Maria Teresa Sholl, n√©e Justa (1761?‚Äî1833) at Aleppo in 1778.Sources citing the wedding certificate suggest that Maria Sholl's mother was named Clara Justa and that Maria Teresa Justa, before marrying William Sholl, \\"abjured the Roman Catholick Religion or the Church of Rome, and embraced the Protestant\\" (e.g. Sherwood 1913‚Äì16, p326). One source (William, Clement & Boase 1876, p46) spells the surname, as \\"Justo\\" and describes Maria Sholl as the daughter of a \\"Greek physician at Aleppo\\" (which, if it was correct, may have meant that the family belonged to a Greek Catholic Church, rather than being Greek in ethnicity). Several members of the family had careers connected to the Royal Navy (RN) or British Army during the 19th century: *Robert Sholl senior (c. 1781‚Äì1832), the father of RJ Sholl, was an official Naval Agent, contracted to supply ships of the RN;A Naval Agent was either a government contractor supplying the Royal Navy (RN), or a commissioned officer of the RN, usually a Lieutenant, who liaised with merchant ship owners and captains contracted by the navy. *Richard Sholl (1786‚Äì1836), an uncle of RJ Sholl, was a naval officer and Purser on HMS Sulphur, when it was part of the 1829 expedition to establish the Swan River Colony ‚Äì he later acquired property there;Western Australian Explorers' Diaries Project, n.d. *Vice Admiral Sir John Kingcome KCB (1794‚Äì1871) was an uncle by marriage; *Dr William Horatio Sholl MRCSE (1808‚Äì76), RJ Sholl's older brother, was a military surgeon with the British Auxiliary Legion in Spain, during the First Carlist War Australian Encyclopaedia (v5), 1977, p333; Perth Gazette, 3 April 1841, p4; South Australian Register, 30 December 1876, p8S and; The West Australian, 26 September 1936, p5 and;Alexander Somerville, 1839, History of the British Legion, and War in Spain, London, James Pattie, p662.) and; *Colonel Edward Corbett MP (1817‚Äì95), an officer in the British Army and later a member of the House of Commons was RJ Sholl's brother-in-law.Corbett married Elizabeth Sholl junior (1826‚Äì?) in WA in 1842 (see, for example, the Perth Gazette of 26 Feb 1842). Robert John Sholl, born on 16 July 1819 in London, was the third of six children of Elizabeth Sholl (n√©e Motton; c. 1782‚Äì18??) and Robert Sholl senior.Birman, 1976, p121; The Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle, 29 October 1832. RJ Sholl was the second oldest sibling (and second oldest son) to survive into adulthood.Birman 2012 Dr William Horatio Sholl emigrated to Western Australia in 1839, after inheriting property from their uncle Richard. Dr Sholl attempted, without success, to be appointed Colonial Surgeon ‚Äì the most senior medical position in WA.Mossenson 2012. After becoming editor of Perth newspaper The Inquirer, WH Sholl used that position for outspoken criticism of some government officials. He later moved to South Australia, where he became a prominent medical practitioner. In 1844, RJ Sholl married Mary Ann Berckelman (1822‚Äì1889) ‚Äì who had been born in Ireland ‚Äì at the Anglican Church in Picton, WA.Landgate 2006‚Äì2007 The couple were to have eight children, and several of their sons became prominent in government and business circles: * Trevarton Sholl (1845‚Äì1867 ‚Äì see below); * Richard Adolphus Sholl (1847‚Äì1919), Postmaster General of WA (1889‚Äì1900); * Robert Frederick Sholl (1848‚Äì1909), MLC/MLA, pearler, investor in real estate and mining, representative at the Australasian Federal Convention of 1897, and; * Horatio William (Horace) Sholl (1852‚Äì1927), MLC/MLA, pastoralist, pearler and mining proprietor. Early career In 1840, Elizabeth Sholl (a widow), followed her oldest son William to Western Australia, along with three of her other children, including RJ Sholl ‚Äì who abandoned his own medical studies. The family arrived in WA on the ship Shepherd on 19 November 1840 and settled in the South West soon afterwards.The Inquirer, 15 November 1843, 17 February 1844 & 17 March 1847 passim; Birman 1976, pp121‚Äì2; Erickson 1987‚Äì88, p2809. RJ Sholl appears to have worked initially as a teacher or private tutor in the Busselton area. Sholl joined an exploration party led by Vernon Bussell and George Warburton, in January 1842 ‚Äì along with four soldiers and four Aboriginal guides ‚Äì seeking to pioneer a cart route between the Bunbury-Vasse area and a proposed road from Perth to King George Sound.The Inquirer, 16 February 1842; Deasey, 1976, pp350‚Äì51; Erickson, 1987‚Äì88, pp3198‚Äì9. They explored the sparsely populated, hilly area between Busselton and the middle Blackwood River before returning to the coast near Bunbury. Although no feasible route was found, Sholl wrote an account of the trip for a newspaper and acquired a reputation as an explorer. In mid-1842, Sholl was one of 24 signatories to an open letter to brothers Alfred and Charles Bussell, thanking them ‚Äúfor the liberal, spirited, and persevering manner with which you have constantly met the aggression of the natives upon the lives and property of the settlers‚Äù.The Inquirer, 13 July 1842; Perth Gazette, 2 & 16 July 1842; Blackburn, 1999, pp26‚Äì28 and; Green, 1995, p216. This followed the trial of Charles Bussell for the manslaughter of a seven-year-old Aboriginal girl; Bussell was discharged with a fine of one shilling. During the mid-1840s, RJ Sholl was appointed to a series of government positions in Bunbury. In 1844, he became a tidewaiter (customs official) and clerk to the District Magistrate‚Äôs Court.Birman 1976; Birman 2012 During 1847, he was made sub- registrar of births, deaths and marriages, as well as Bunbury‚Äôs postmaster. He also became involved in private businesses, such as fattening beef cattle.The Inquirer, 7 February 1844, p1 In 1849, Sholl succeeded his brother William as editor of Perth newspaper The Inquirer, which was owned by Edmund Stirling. The following year RJ Sholl was appointed secretary of the Geraldine Mining Company,Kimberly 1897, p163. formed to operate the first commercial mine in WA: a lead and copper mining lease in the riverbed, banks and near to the Murchison River.The former mining lease is located just west of the point at which the river is crossed by the North West Coastal Highway, and about 25‚Äì30 miles (40‚Äì48 km) east south east of the mouth of the Murchison. Sholl resigned from The Inquirer in early 1855, and with financial support from George Leake, established a new weekly, The Commercial News and Shipping Gazette, from offices in Fremantle.The Commercial News, 22 February & 28 June 1855; The Inquirer, 13 June 1855; Medcalf, 1974, pp70‚Äì71; Erickson, 1987‚Äì88, p2809. After 20 issues, The Commercial News was merged with The Inquirer and Sholl became a part-owner and editor of the new title, The Inquirer & Commercial News. Like his brother before him, RJ Sholl used editorials in The Inquirer to mount campaigns against officialdom.The Inquirer, 3 April, 24 April & 1 May 1861; Honniball 1979, pp37‚Äì43. In particular, during 1861 he attacked the Colonial government, over an unpopular customs regulation. Inquirer articles singled out Governor Arthur Kennedy and called on the Imperial government to transfer Kennedy to another position. By contrast, Sholl and The Inquirer were very supportive of both Kennedy‚Äôs assistant, Frederick Barlee (Colonial Secretary of Western Australia in 1855‚Äì75) and his successor as Governor, John Hampton. Sholl's personal and professional connections to Barlee was long- lived and included their joint involvement in private businesses.For example, Barlee and Sholl were shareholders and office bearers of the Roebuck Bay Pastoral and Agricultural Association Limited. Career as Government Resident The first settlers in the northern half of Western Australia ‚Äì led by Perth entrepreneur Walter Padbury ‚Äì disembarked on 8 May 1863 with sheep and other livestock at Tien Tsin Harbor (later known as Cossack), near the Harding River.Perth Gazette, 29 May 1863 and; The Inquirer, 3 June 1863. (In 1871, Tien Tsin Harbor was renamed Cossack, following the visit of Governor Frederick Weld on board HMS Cossack.) Over the next few years, pastoralists applied for leases between the De Grey and Ashburton Rivers (in the region known later as the Pilbara). The population of pastoralists ‚Äì which included some southern Aboriginal stock workers ‚Äì remained small in number. =Camden Harbour= In 1864, plans for a settlement (and, potentially, a separate Colony) near the northern tip of WA, emerged in the form of the Camden Harbor Pastoral Association. The Camden Harbour venture consequently attracted a significant number of settlers, most of them from the Western District of Victoria. About 170 settlers sailed from Melbourne in November 1864.Richards, 1990, pp196-203. Upon their arrival in the north, it was immediately obvious to most settlers that the tropical climate was inimical to sheep and many settlers left immediately. At the beginning of 1865 ‚Äì to forestall the possibility of any of its territory being excised ‚Äì the WA Government appointed Sholl as Government Resident of the North District. In order to establish a permanent presence, the government sent Sholl to Camden Harbour, with a party of 46 government employees, including a surveying team under James Cowle, Pensioner Guards, police and labourers. His eldest son, Trevarton Sholl was included and served as customs officer, postmaster and clerk to his father. In April, Sholl and a heavily armed exploration party attempted to locate a route from Camden Harbour to Roebuck Bay. They succeeded in crossing the Glenelg River, but did not travel much further.Perth Gazette, 15 September 1865, p2. During this journey, Sholl named the McRae River after a young member of the expedition, Alexander McRae. Sholl‚Äôs account of the expedition was later published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society (1866). In June, a party that included McRae and Trevarton Sholl (but not his father) attempted the same journey and also failed. From 29 June to 3 May 1865 they were hosts to the crew of the \\"Forlorn Hope\\", escapees from the failed settlement at Escape Cliffs, Northern Territory, and were treated hospitably. They had hoped to pick up provisions or, better still, passage to Fremantle, but there was no relief ship expected for months, and what provisions could be spared were adequate for the next leg of their journey, but not over-generous. this article includes extensive descriptions of the place and its problems. The settlement was visited by Makassan mariners (who, like others who would now be termed Indonesian, were often referred to as \\"Malays\\"), in April 1865. Although Makassans had been travelling to northern Australia for centuries, Sholl wrote one of the first descriptions of them visiting Western Australia.O'Connor, 2008, p400. North District, was the vast area defined by Land Regulations (1862) as north of a border that followed the Murchison River north west from the sea for approximately 100 miles, and then followed a line \\"through the summit of Mount Murchison\\" (approx. 26¬∞ 43' 51\\" South, 116¬∞ 25' 16\\" East), east to the Colonial border.The Inquirer & Commercial News, 20 July 1864, p2. Sholl and the few remaining settlers were evacuated from Camden Harbour in October 1865.Perth Gazette, 24 November 1865. The Resident, with a significantly reduced staff, moved to Tien Tsin Harbor and set up a government camp near the homestead of Mount Welcome Station, a pastoral lease held by Emma and John Withnell. Sholl was accompanied by his son Trevarton and about 10 other government employees, most of them semi- skilled labourers, along with a few police and southern Aboriginal convicts, detached from the prison on Rottnest Island. =1866‚Äì1869= The Government Resident's duties were focused initially on organising surveying expeditions (which were led in the field by government surveyor Charles Wedge), exploration, land and livestock regulations and the construction of basic infrastructure; Sholl presided over few court cases, other than Master and Servant disputes, most of which involved government employees. During the 1860s, the various indigenous peoples of the North West sought or were forced to seek employment with settlers in increasing numbers. In addition to woolgrowing, a significant pearling industry emerged around Nickol Bay, from boats usually based at Tien Tsin Harbor. Most pearling vessels employed local indigenous divers, for payment in staple foods and other commodities (e.g. tobacco).Bain, 1982, p17. However, many Aboriginal people were dying as a result of newly introduced diseases, exacerbated by drought, famine and competition with settlers and their livestock, and; violence. In 1866, Sholl documented how the local Aboriginal population was decimated by smallpox (which is now believed to have been carried to Australia with Makassans).Campbell, 2002, pp60‚Äì1, 80‚Äì1, 194‚Äì6, 201, 216‚Äì7 and; Willis, 2010, pp70‚Äì73. This led to competition amongst settlers to recruit and retain indigenous workers.Mercer, 1958, pp34‚Äì36 In some cases, pearlers and pastoralists used coercion, and confinement, supported by the severe Master & Servant laws, to recruit, retain and discipline indigenous workers. As was this case in many parts of northern Australia, this evolved into a form of unfree labour, officially sanctioned and enforced by police, under which indigenous people became dependent upon \\"rations\\" (payment in kind; i.e. food and other goods and services) provided by their employers. While pastoralists attempted to retain employees on sheep stations, it is also alleged (conversely) that pearlers sometimes abandoned indigenous crew members far from their traditional lands. Sholl developed close ties to some pastoral and pearling entrepreneurs, such as Charles Broadhurst.McCarthy, 2001, p33. (From 1883, the North District was divided into three magisterial districts: Gascoyne, Northern (Roebourne) and Kimberley.) For instance, during 1866, Broadhurst served as acting Government Resident, while Sholl attended to personal business in Perth. During 1866 and 1867, tensions between settlers and indigenous peoples increased, as they competed for scarce resources water and food resources. This emerged in various forms, such as the appropriation of livestock and staple foods like flour, and armed conflict. An increasing number of indigenous people were charged, with offences such as theft. They were usually sentenced to hard labour for the government or, in some cases, transportation to Rottnest. Roebourne, which would become the oldest surviving town in the North West, was gazetted in 1866 on a site adjoining the Mt Welcome homestead. In March 1867, a 116-ton wooden schooner, Emma, departed from Tien Tsin Harbor with 41 people, approximately one third of the settler population of the north-west; the ship disappeared before reaching Fremantle.The wreck of the Emma was discovered at Coral Bay in 1979. (Henderson & Henderson, 1988, pp 67‚Äì71; Jones & McWilliam, 2008, p2 and; Perth Gazette, 12 July 1867.) Among those lost was Trevarton Sholl. Conflict between settlers and local indigenous people peaked during 1868‚Äì69. On the night of 6‚Äì7 February 1868, Police Constable William Griffis and his Aboriginal assistant Peter, along with a pearler called George Breem, were killed by members of the Jaburara (or Yaburara) people on the shores of Nickol Bay, near the Jaburara heartland of Dampier Peninsula (later renamed Burrup Peninsula).Gara, 1983 and; Veth, Bradshaw, Gara, Hall, Haydock & Kendrick, 1993. Another pearler, Henry Jermyn disappeared shortly afterwards. In response, Sholl organised, armed and supplied two groups of mounted men, sworn in as special constables. On 14‚Äì15 February, a party led by Alexander McRae travelled overland to the peninsula, while another, led by John Withnell sailed on a ship chartered for the purpose, to the tip of the peninsula. The two mounted parties attacked Jaburara people on the peninsula and the nearby islands of the Dampier Archipelago. The number and identity of those killed by the special constables in the \\"Flying Foam Massacre\\" is unknown; estimates range from two to 150, although a figure of 30‚Äì40 dead is often cited.Western Australian Museum, n.d., Nautilus.See, for example: Veth, Bradshaw, Gara, Hall, Haydock & Kendrick, 1993, pp54, 57; Conole, 2002, pp 54‚Äì56, 403. The Jaburara population collapsed soon afterwards, in part because of their recruitment by pearlers. Sholl was criticised by other officials and at least one northern pastoralist, WA Taylor, who claimed that Griffis had attracted animosity by seducing and/or raping a Jaburara woman; Taylor's claim is also supported by oral tradition among indigenous people in the area.Gara, 1983, p92. The following year, the killing of station workers, both white and Aboriginal, by indigenous hunter-gatherers at ET Hooley's station, the only one in operation on the Ashburton River, resulted in RJ Sholl overseeing further expeditions by armed, mounted police and settlers, culminating in the so-called \\"Battle of Minderoo\\" (18 July 1869). However, these reprisals came too late to prevent the abandonment of Hooley's station. =1870‚Äì1886= In early 1872, copper ore was discovered near Roebourne. The region‚Äôs first mine opened and within a year 40 tons had been exported.The Inquirer, 10 April 1872, p3; Hennig, 2004, p15. A major cyclone struck the region on 20 March 1872, killing several people, injuring many others (including Sholl himself), killing more than 5,000 sheep.Perth Gazette, 17 May 1872, p2; The Inquirer, 10 July 1872, p4 and; Hennig, 2004, p15. and destroying or unroofing every building in Roebourne. Sholl estimated that damage worth between ¬£12,000 and ¬£20,000 (approximately $1.8‚Äì3.0 million in 2012) was caused to the region. An even larger cyclone hit the region on 6 January 1881 and, in spite of building improvements over the preceding nine years, had deadly consequences for the pearling industry, killing 16 people and sinking or beaching all but one vessel in the area.Bureau of Meteorology; 2012 During the 1870s, while indigenous workers were still invaluable to employers, an ongoing decline in the local Aboriginal population led to the recruitment of male workers from South East Asia, often West Timorese people (who were usually referred to as \\"Kupangers\\" at the time) and ethnic Chinese workers from Singapore.The Inquirer, 30 December 1874, p2 and; Atkinson, 1991, p28 and; Campbell, 2002, pp213‚Äì4. The need to protect Aboriginal workers was expressed by RJ Sholl in, for example, his submission towards the 1873 Pearl Shell Fishery Regulation Act. However, Sholl remained close to business people such as Broadhurst, who were attracting attention due to deaths, disease and injury amongst their indigenous employees.McCarthy, 2001, p40. Sholl bought the lease of Mount Welcome Station from the Withnell family in 1879, after which the property was operated by his sons. In 1881, Sholl was appointed Police Magistrate and Magistrate of the Local Court at Perth, and Resident Magistrate for the Swan District and Magistrate of the Local Court at Guildford. His successor as Resident Magistrate was Edward Hayes Laurence, nephew of Frederick Barlee (who had been transferred British Honduras as Lieutenant-Governor in 1877). Sholl refused the appointment and retired on a pension rather than move from Roebourne. Prolonged ill-health resulted in Sholl's departure from Roebourne in April 1883, when he moved to Perth. Sholl died at the residence of his daughter, Penelope Scott (1856‚Äì1929) and her husband, Dr Edward Scott JP on 19 June 1886.The West Australian, 22 June 1886 (p2) and 13 March 1929 (p16). Robert John Sholl was buried in the Anglican Cemetery at East Perth the day after his death. Four of his sons were also prominent: * Trevarton Sholl (1845‚Äì1867), explorer, public servant and diarist; * Richard Adolphus Sholl (1847‚Äì1919), Postmaster General of WA (1889‚Äì1900); * Robert Frederick Sholl (1848‚Äì1909), MLC/MLA, pearler, investor in real estate and mining, representative at the Australasian Federal Convention of 1897, and; * Horatio William (Horace) Sholl (1852‚Äì1927), MLC/MLA, pastoralist, pearler and mining proprietor. Penelope and Edward Scott later moved to England, where one of their sons, Dr Frank Sholl Scott (1886‚Äì1952), and one of their grandsons (RJ Sholl's great grandson), Dr Edward Keith Scott (1918‚Äì1995), both became members of the English national rugby team and medical practitioners. Posthumous honours and memorials Sholl is the subject of the \\"1866\\" plaque, among the 150 St George's Terrace Commemorative Plaques, placed in 1979 to commemorate the sesquicentenary of European settlement in WA.

She carried out one patrol. She did not sink or damage any ships. She was sunk by a British aircraft southeast of Iceland in June 1943. Design German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-417 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged.

She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-417 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history The submarine was laid down on 16 September 1941 at the Danziger Werft (yard) at Danzig (now Gdansk), as yard number 118, launched on 6 September 1942 and commissioned on the 26th under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang Schreiner. She served with the 8th U-boat Flotilla from 26 September 1942 and the 6th flotilla from 1 June 1943. =Patrol and loss= U-417 was sunk on 11 June 1943 southeast of Iceland by depth charges from a British B-17 Flying Fortress of No. 206 Squadron RAF. Forty-six men were lost with U-417; there were no survivors. =Aftermath= U-417s anti-aircraft fire had been accurate. The B-17 ditched; all eight of the crew were forced to share a single dinghy. On 14 June, an American navy PBY Catalina attempted a landing but crashed. Its crew of nine found themselves adrift on two rafts. The B-17 crew were found and rescued by Jack Holmes in a British Catalina of 190 squadron on the same day of their ditching, but the Americans were not found for another five days.

It is a long, slender fish that grows to a maximum length of about . Description Bichirs are primitive fish which have a jaw structure that resembles that of tetrapods rather than bony fishes; they also have rudimentary lungs and two slit-like spiracles used for exhalation, and can breathe air when there is insufficient oxygen in the water. The West African bichir has an elongated cylindrical body with a maximum length of . It can be distinguished from other members of the genus by having jaws that are about the same length, and in living specimens, having creamy-white irises speckled with black. The dorsal fin consists of 7 to 9 separate finlets each topped with a sharp spine. The pectoral fin is fleshy and has 30 to 32 soft rays and the anal fin has 12 to 15 spines. The dorsal surface and flanks are olive brown with irregular markings of darker brown and the ventral surface is whitish or pale beige. The dorsal and caudal fins are pale beige with dark marks in rows, and black blotches at the base of the spines. The pectoral fins have distinctive black blotches at the base and rows of tiny black spots on the webbing. The pelvic and anal fins are whitish. Distribution The West African bichir is a freshwater fish native to tropical West Africa. Its range includes the basins of the Ogoou√© River and the Congo River, and possibly the Cross River basin in Cameroon. Its typical habitat is swamps and floodplains. Behaviour This species is territorial, with territory holders threatening intruders. The attacker starts the encounter by raising its dorsal fin spines and emitting staccato thumping sounds; both fish may continue by biting at each other, or one may submit and flee, emitting drawn-out moans. Use in aquaria P. retropinnis is sometimes kept in aquaria. It will feed on small to medium-sized vertebrates and invertebrates, eating anything it can fit into its mouth.

Players have the choice of two aircraft: the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, with the former primarily focusing on escort missions and patrols and the latter on bombing runs such as destroying patrol boats, bridges and SCUD missile bases. The player is able to play the entire mission from take-off, cruise, the mission itself, return cruise and landing, the latter presenting an especially high degree of challenge. In-flight refuelling is also a feature of the game during longer missions, and provides a similar challenge to the player's piloting skills. Should a player not wish to fly a mission, they may report to the sick bay, but too many visits may cause the player to be declared unfit for duty. However, when a pilot is declared unfit (which is also caused by ejecting too many times), missing in action or if they are killed, a new pilot can be added to the roster and the game resumes from where the player's last previous left off. As well as flying the aircraft, the player can command ground troops, plan mission routes and select the ordinance the aircraft should hold. There are also training missions and an option for instant action, which usually places the user in a dogfight. The game is won when either Kuwait is liberated or Saddam Hussein is killed. Tip- offs to the latter's location are sometimes given and the player may opt to attempt a bombing run to kill him.

It features many cast members who appeared in the Beach Party movies. Plot Sergeant Deadhead is a bumbling soldier who is sent to the guardhouse for blowing up a model rocket on the parade ground of the air base where he is stationed. His fianc√©e, Airman Lucy Turner despairs of ever marrying him because of him being constantly disciplined for his antics. She is worried that she will have to marry him while he is in the guardhouse. Together with Private McEvoy, Sergeant Deadhead escapes from the guardhouse. Private McEvoy decides to break back in, but Sergeant Deadhead hides in a nearby space rocket, not knowing it is set to blast off with a chimpanzee aboard. He falls asleep in the rocket's control room and is accidentally blasted into space, together with the chimpanzee. When Sergeant Deadhead is discovered to be aboard the rocket, General Fogg decides to spin the facts and say that Sergeant Deadhead volunteered for the mission. He and Navy Captain Weiskopf also decide that Sergeant Deadhead and Airman Turner will have a well publicized wedding on the air base when Sergeant Deadhead returns to earth. When Sergeant Deadhead returns home he is a national hero but has also developed a massive ego due to space travel causing his personality to blend with that of the chimpanzee, and the realization that he has become a media sensation. A soldier who looks exactly like him, Sergeant Donovan, is found to take his place. When the smooth talking Sergeant Donovan is set to take Sergeant Deadhead's place at the altar, Sergeant Deadhead breaks out of the guardhouse, starts to recover his personality, and switches places with Sergeant Donovan. When the leadership realizes he has escaped the guardhouse, he runs away. Sergeant Deadhead finds out about Sergeant Donovan, and goes to the hotel where the wedding reception and honeymoon are taking place. There he switches places with Sergeant Donovan to enjoy his honeymoon. However, General Fogg and the others find Donovan and take him back to the honeymoon suite, looking for Deadhead.

The landing force then congregated at the Wouri estuary where the Germans had been given time to prepare their marine defenses. German defense of the Wouri Estuary In preparation for the coming Allied landings, the Germans mined the Wouri estuary. They sunk 10 or 12 steamships and mine planters in the rivermouth of the Wouri, to prevent landings at Douala.Reynolds, Churchill, Miller 1916. On 11 September the 710-ton gunboat HMS Dwarf attempted to enter the rivermouth but was damaged by German artillery fire and retreated. On 15 September an attempt was made to blow up the Dwarf with a launch full of explosives, but failed. On 16 September, the German customs cutter Nachtigal rammed the Dwarf; an ensuing explosion sank the Nachtigal, killing 36 of her crew. Another attempt to sink the Dwarf took place when two German launches used spar torpedoes to sink the ship but failed.Buchan 1922, p. 423. Other encounters between British and German light craft occurred throughout mid-September. Allied landings After clearing a three-mile-wide belt of mines and other obstructions, the cruisers HMS Challenger and HMS Cumberland, the Dwarf, and five troopships moved up the Wouri to Douala. The Allied commander of the landing force, Major General Charles Dobell, sent an ultimatum to the German garrison at Douala demanding surrender. Receiving no answer, the British bombarded the town on 26 September. The German garrison stationed in the town promptly withdrew. On 27 September, around 1,000 British and French soldiers landed at Douala, occupying the port without resistance. They found the wireless station there had been destroyed by the retreating Germans, and captured a number of merchant vessels, as well as a German gunboat, the Soden. At around the same time, Allied forces landed at Bonaberi, a town across the Wouri river from Douala that the Germans had not yet given up. After some fighting the town was surrendered and the German force retreated into the interior of the colony. Shortly after the Allied landings at Douala, the French vessel Surprise shelled the southern coastal town of Ukoko; two German armed vessels, the Khios and Itolo, were sunk. French infantry landed at Ukoko and took the town shortly after fighting the German garrison there.D'Almeida, 2008. This battle meant that Germany had effectively no control over the portion of Kamerun to the south of the Spanish colony of Rio Muni Aftermath The naval operations of the Kamerun Campaign resulted in Allied naval domination of the Wouri estuary and Bight of Bonny, as well as the capture of the main port of Douala and much of the colony's coast. It forced the Germans to withdraw from the populated coast to the mountainous jungle interior of Kamerun. Small German forces attempted to hold onto rivers vital for transportation near Douala, but were pushed further into the interior by British forces in the Battle of Jabassi in early October. On October 3, a French Senegalese force pushed German defenders out of their positions on the Japona river. On 26 October, British and French troops traveling by river threatened Edea, a village some German detachments had fallen back to after the capture of Douala. However, they withdrew and surrendered the town without a fight.Strachan 2001, p. 524. Notes References *Buchan, John. A History of the Great War. Vol. I.

Obama, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 12-cv-331 and Hedges et v. Obama, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-3176 was a lawsuit filed in January 2012 against the Obama administration and members of the U.S. Congress by a group including former New York Times reporter Christopher Hedges, challenging the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (NDAA). The legislation permitted the U.S. government to indefinitely detain people \\"who are part of or substantially support Al Qaeda, the Taliban or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States\\". The plaintiffs contended that Section 1021(b)(2) of the law allows for detention of citizens and permanent residents taken into custody in the U.S. on \\"suspicion of providing substantial support\\" to groups engaged in hostilities against the U.S. such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban respectively that the NDAA arms the U.S. military with the ability to imprison indefinitely journalists, activists and human-rights workers based on vague allegations. A federal court in New York issued a permanent injunction blocking the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA but the injunction was stayed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals pending appeal by the Obama Administration. On July 17, 2013, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court's permanent injunction blocking the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on April 28, 2014, leaving the Second Circuit decision intact. History summary In May 2012, a federal court in New York issued a preliminary injunction which temporarily blocked the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA (section 1021(b) (2)) on the grounds of unconstitutionality. On August 6, 2012 federal prosecutors representing President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta filed a notice of appeal. The following day arguments from both sides were heard by U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest during a hearing to determine whether to make her preliminary injunction permanent or not. On September 12, 2012, Judge Forrest issued a permanent injunction, but this was appealed by the Obama Administration on September 13, 2012. A federal appeals court granted a U.S. Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the permanent injunction, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. The court also said that a Second Circuit motions panel will take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012. On October 2, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ban on indefinite detention will not go into effect until a decision on the Obama Administration's appeal is rendered. The U.S. Supreme Court refused on December 14, 2012 to lift the stay pending appeal order issued by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals on October 2, 2012. Oral arguments were heard before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals on February 6, 2013. The U.S. Supreme Court refused again on February 19, 2013 to lift the stay pending appeal order issued by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals on October 2, 2012. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned on July 17, 2013 the district court's ruling which struck down ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of NDAA as unconstitutional because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in an order issued April 28, 2014.  Background  According to the text of Section 1021 of the NDAA provided that the U.S. President may authorize the armed forces to indefinitely detain the following persons set forth in ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA: Section 1021(e) of the NDAA, provided: Attorneys Carl J. Mayer and Bruce I. Afran filed a complaint January 13, 2012, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, against Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in the case Hedges v. Obama, 12-cv-00331, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan) to challenge the legality of the Authorization for Use of Military Force as embedded in the latest version of the National Defense Authorization Act, signed by the president Dec. 31, 2011. Plaintiffs were journalist Christopher Hedges, Pentagon Papers, whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, writer and linguist Noam Chomsky, Icelandic parliamentarian Birgitta J√≥nsd√≥ttir, activist and RevolutionTruth founder Jennifer Bolen, Occupy London activist Kai Wargalla, journalist and founder of \\"US Day of Rage\\" Alexa O'Brien, and American academic Cornel West. Besides Barack Obama and Leon Panetta other defendants are John McCain, John Boehner, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and Eric Cantor.http://www.law.com/jsp/decision_friendly.jsp?id=1202554341203 The plaintiffs said the NDAA chills speech by threatening constitutionally protected activities such as news reporting, protest and political organizing in defense of controversial causes such as the WikiLeaks case. They claim that the law not only put them at risk of arrest but also allows indefinite detentions of U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, and that the provisions are too vague. The principal allegation made by the plaintiffs against the NDAA was that the vagueness of critical terms in the NDAA could be interpreted by the federal government in a way that authorizes them to label journalists and political activists who interview or support outspoken critics of the Obama administration's policies as \\"covered persons,\\" meaning that they have given \\"substantial support\\" to terrorists or other \\"associated groups.\\" Fearing that section 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA could be applied to journalists and that the specter of such a scenario would have a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of the press in violation of the First Amendment, Hedges filed his lawsuit on January 12, 2012. Naomi Wolf wrote for example in her affidavit that she has refused to conduct many investigative interviews for fear that she could be detained under the auspices of applicable sections of the NDAA.Naomi Wolf, The reason I'm helping Chris Hedges' lawsuit against the NDAA, The Guardian (March 28, 2012). Plaintiff Bolen wrote that \\"My activities as a civil liberties, democracy advocate and independent journalist definitely leave me under the purview of the vague language of the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]\\" because of her contact with WikiLeaks activists and that \\"I believe that could leave me in imminent danger of harm.\\" Hedges' complaint claimed that his extensive work overseas, particularly in the Middle East covering terrorist (or suspected terrorist) organizations, could cause him to be categorized as a \\"covered person\\" who, by way of such writings, interviews and/or communications, \\"substantially supported\\" or \\"directly supported\\" \\"al- Qaeda, the Taliban or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, ... under ¬ß1031(b)(2) and the AUMF [Authorization for Use of Military Force].\\"  District Court proceedings  During a hearing on March 29, 2012 plaintiffs Alexa O'Brien, Kai Wargalla and Christopher Hedges testified. O'Brien testified that she shelved two investigations about Guantanamo detainees for fear of reprisal under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Wargalla said that she and other organizers from the Revolution Truth movement, which broadcasts \\"Live Panels\\" over the Internet on various topics, shelved the idea of inviting \\"groups like Hamas\\", a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, after the NDAA was passed. Hedges stated the National Defense Authorization Act affects him personally. Government lawyers in return did not offer any witnesses in support of the law. In a post-hearing memorandum the lawyers for the plaintiffs rejected the U.S. governments repeated position that the NDAA is merely an \\"affirmation\\" of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF). \\"This court need not and should not indulge the fiction that section 1021 merely acknowledges authority latent in the AUMF,\\" the memo stated. The plaintiffs outlined the NDAA and AUMF in the memorandum. \\"AUMF authority is linked to the 9/11 attacks, and the purpose of AUMF authority is 'to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States' by those involved in the 9/11 attacks, and those that harbored them,\\" the memorandum states. > By contrast, Section 1021(b)(2) authority is linked to no event, states no > specific purpose, and extends to 'covered persons' who 'substantially > support' those 'that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or > its coalition partners,' a far broader 'catchment' than the AUMF. Lawmakers, free-press advocates, small-government partisans, conservative think tanks, pro-gun groups, border-control activists, civil libertarians, a pastor and a professor, acting as amici curiae, stated in this context that the constitutionality of the AUMF authorization merits review and that the NDAA violates the Treason Clause of the U.S. Constitution. = Preliminary injunction against enforcement of ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA = A federal court in New York City issued an order blocking the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA for American citizens after finding it unconstitutional. On May 16, 2012, in response to the lawsuit filed by journalist Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Wolf and others, US District Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled in a 68-page opinion that Section 1021 of the NDAA was unconstitutional because it violates the 1st and 5th Amendments. Judge Forrest agreed with the plaintiffs that ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA was \\"constitutionally infirm, violating both their free speech and associational rights guaranteed by the First Amendment as well as due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution\\", also noting that the United States government \\"did not call any witnesses, submit any documentary evidence or file any declarations\\" in the case, and that \\"the government was unwilling or unable to state that these plaintiffs would not be subject to indefinite detention under [Section] 1021\\", putting them at risk. Judge Forrest therefore issued a preliminary injunction which prevented the US government from enforcing section 1021 of the NDAA's \\"Homeland Battlefield\\" provisions pending further order of the court or an amendment to the statute by US Congress. \\"There is a strong public interest in protecting rights guaranteed by the First Amendment,\\" Forrest wrote in granting the temporary injunction. \\"There is also a strong public interest in ensuring that due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment are protected by ensuring that ordinary citizens are able to understand the scope of conduct that could subject them to indefinite military detention.\\" Judge Forrest was requested by the Obama administration to undo her ruling. In a footnote of the request, the Administration claimed \\"The government construes this Court's Order as applying only as to the named plaintiffs in this suit\\". In an opinion and order filed June 6, 2012, Judge Forrest clarified her statement, saying that her injunction applies not just to the named plaintiffs in the suit, contrary to government's narrow interpretation. She wrote, \\"Put more bluntly, the May 16 order enjoined enforcement of Section 1021(b)(2) against anyone until further action by this, or a higher, court ‚Äî or by Congress ... This order should eliminate any doubt as to the May 16 order's scope\\". The detention provision was not blocked for any persons connected to the September 11 attacks, as Section 1021(b)(1), which essentially restates the scope of the AUMF, was not blocked. = U.S. government appeal of preliminary injunction = The U.S. government appealed Judge Forrest's preliminary injunction which prevents the U.S. government from enforcing section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act's \\"Homeland Battlefield\\" provisions on August 6, 2012. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, which represents the government in this case, along with named defendants Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta filed its notice of appeal with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal government argues in its appeal that in cases dealing with \\"militants\\" and those offering \\"substantial support\\" to them indefinite detention without due process is appropriate. On November 6, 2012, the U.S. government noted that \\"[g]iven the district court's entry of a permanent injunction, the government's appeal of the preliminary injunction ... is moot\\". = Permanent injunction against enforcement of ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA = A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction of the indefinite detention provisions of the NDAA came before Judge Forrest on August 7, 2012. On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest granted the plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction of ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in a 112-page opinion. The permanent injunction issued by Judge Forrest barred the government from relying on the defense authorization law to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion that they \\"substantially supported\\" Al Qaeda or its allies ‚Äî at least if they had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Forrest held that the law's definitions of \\"substantially supported\\" and \\"associated forces\\" were unconstitutionally vague in that a reporter or activist could not be sure they would not be covered under the provision if they worked with a group deemed to be associated with terrorists, or perhaps circulated the message of an associated individual by printing an interview. Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism, but ruled that the law's broad language violated First Amendment right to free speech, as well as the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process that holds that a person must be able to understand what actions would subject them to penalties. Forrest wrote: \\"First Amendment rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and cannot be legislated away. This Court rejects the Government's suggestion that American citizens can be placed in military detention indefinitely, for acts they could not predict might subject them to detention.\\" \\"When the government was asked by the court what the words 'substantially supported' mean, it was unable to provide a definition; the same was true for 'directly supported',\\" she wrote in her order, which makes the preliminary injunction permanent. \\"There can be no doubt, then, these terms are vague.\\" That vagueness does not put citizens on notice, in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, she ruled. > A key question throughout these proceedings has been ... precisely what the > statute means‚Äîwhat and whose activities it is meant to cover. That is no > small question bandied about amongst lawyers and a judge steeped in arcane > questions of constitutional law; it is a question of defining an > individual's core liberties. The due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth > Amendment require that an individual understand what conduct might subject > him or her to criminal or civil penalties. Here, the stakes get no higher: > indefinite military detention‚Äîpotential detention during a war on terrorism > that is not expected to end in the foreseeable future, if ever. The > Constitution requires specificity‚Äîand that specificity is absent from > Section 1021(b)(2). Understanding the scope of Section 1021(b)(2) requires > defining key terms. Forrest also rejected the US government's position that federal courts should provide habeas corpus, rather than judicial, review to military detainees as \\"without merit\\" and \\"dangerous\\". The government argued that the issue is not the court's business and that courts could consider individual habeas corpus petitions from prisoners who have been detained. \\"That argument is without merit and, indeed, dangerous,\\" wrote Judge Forrest. \\"Habeas petitions (which take years to be resolved following initial detention) are reviewed under a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard (versus the criminal standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt') by a single judge in a civil proceeding, not a jury of twelve citizens in a criminal proceeding which can only return a guilty verdict if unanimous.\\" \\"If only habeas review is available to those detained ... even U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, core constitutional rights available in criminal matters would simply be eliminated,\\" she wrote. \\"No court can accept this proposition and adhere truthfully to its oath.\\" Forrest refused to \\"abdicate\\" her duty to protect constitutional rights out of deference for executive power. \\"Courts must safeguard core constitutional rights,\\" she wrote. > A long line of Supreme Court precedent adheres to that fundamental principle > in unequivocal language. Although it is true that there are scattered cases > - primarily decided during World War II - in which the Supreme Court > sanctioned undue deference to the executive and legislative branches on > constitutional questions, those cases are generally now considered an > embarrassment. The military detentions of Fred Korematsu, in a Japanese internment camp, and Nazi saboteur Richard Quirin, who was executed by a war court, provide two such examples, Forrest said. > The court is mindful of the extraordinary importance of the government's > efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism. In light of the high stakes > of those efforts as well as the executive branch's expertise, courts > undoubtedly owe the political branches a great deal of deference in the area > of national security ... Nevertheless, the Constitution places affirmative > limits on the power of the Executive to act, and these limits apply in times > of peace as well as times of war. Heedlessly to refuse to hear > constitutional challenges to the Executive's conduct in the name of > deference would be to abdicate this court's responsibility to safeguard the > rights it has sworn to uphold. Forrest declared that the NDAA cannot be used to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion of having \\"substantially supported\\" al-Qaeda or its allies. \\"The law of war has never been, and should not be, part of the domestic laws in the United States,\\" she wrote. \\"The law of war is vague by necessity - it needs flexibility. It is therefore ill-suited to domestic application and it would be ill-advised to make it a part of domestic law.\\" Forrest also argued that in passing the law, Congress had dramatically expanded the categories of people that can be detained. The U.S. government had argued that the NDAA was a reassertion of powers provided by Congress in the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which targeted perpetrators of the September 11 attacks and those who helped them. Judge Forrest said the new measure was broader, because it covered people beyond those connected to the 9/11 attacks. In sum Judge Forrest ruled: In her permanent injunction order Judge Forrest invited Congress to examine whether it needed the NDAA at all, or whether it wanted to fix what she had found to be its \\"deficiencies\\". As of December 12, 2012, Congress did not respond. = U.S. government appeal and stay of permanent injunction = On September 13, 2012, federal prosecutors in Manhattan, acting on behalf of the U.S. government, appealed the judge's permanent injunction. In court papers on September 14, 2012, they also asked the judge to immediately freeze her order until it is taken up by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. More precisely the U.S. government sought both an immediate temporary stay on Judge Forrest's September 12, 2012 ruling so that the matter can be argued, and a permanent one lasting until higher courts resolve the case. In their court papers on September 14, 2012 government lawyers said the plaintiffs had no basis to fear being locked up for their activities, and that the judge's order interfered with the president's powers at a time of war. Government attorneys argue that the executive branch is entitled to latitude when it comes to cases of national security and that the law is neither too broad nor overly vague. Judge Forrest's opinion is \\"unprecedented, and the government has compelling arguments that it should be reversed,\\" prosecutors said. They called the permanent injunction an \\"extraordinary injunction of worldwide scope\\". Lawyers for the Obama administration also argued that the United States will be irreparably harmed if it has to abide by a judge's ruling that it can no longer hold terrorism suspects indefinitely without trial in military custody. The government said that the injunction was an \\"unprecedented\\" trespass on power of the president and the legislature that by its very nature was doing irreparable harm. They also argued that the injunction places an undue burden on military commanders in a time of war while the plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of ever being detained \\"in the foreseeable future\\". > The Court's injunction against application of section 1021 'in any manner, > as to any person,' ... combined with its mistaken view that section 1021 > goes beyond reaffirming the authority contained in the AUMF, could impose > entirely unjustified burdens on military officials worldwide, complicating > the ability to carry out an armed conflict authorized by Congress in the > public interest ... Given the absence of any risk of impending harm to > plaintiffs, the serious injury to the government and the public interest in > the invalidation of a statute enacted by public representatives, and the > possible effect on an ongoing armed conflict and the Executive's > prerogatives in military affairs, a stay is necessary. Judge Forrest denied on September 14, 2012 the government's request for an immediate stay of her injunction so that ¬ß 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA law cannot currently be used and said she would rule on September 19, 2012 on whether to suspend it from then on. At that juncture the U.S. Justice Department said it would not wait until September 19, 2012 and will file emergency papers on September 17, 2012 morning. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had asked on September 17, 2012 the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to place an emergency stay on the permanent injunction made by Judge Forrest on September 12, 2012 so that the U.S. president's power to indefinitely detain without charge people accused of providing substantial support to terrorist groups is reaffirmed immediately. The Justice Department wanted the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to put the judge's ruling on hold while they challenge her decision on appeal. The DOJ contended that Judge Katherine Forrest's ruling incorrectly interpreted the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Justice Department also said Forrest's decision not only invalidated the NDAA, but went further: rejecting the White House's long-standing interpretation of the President's and the military's authority to detain terror suspects. In a 42-page court filing, the government argued that \\"the district court expressly invites actions for contempt sanctions if the military exercises detention authority in a manner inconsistent with the court's deeply flawed understanding of the scope of that authority\\" and that \\"the order \\"threatens irreparable harm to national security and the public interest by injecting added burdens and dangerous confusion into the conduct of military operations abroad during an active armed conflict\\". Second Circuit proceedings = Stay pending appeal = On September 17, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to place a temporary emergency stay on the permanent injunction made by Judge Forrest five days earlier. Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order granting the motion on the same day, staying the permanent injunction in Hedges, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal and consideration of the government's motion for stay pending appeal by the Second Circuit motions panel w on September 28, 2012. One day before the September 28, 2012 U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals hearing, Hedges asserted in a Reddit question- and-answer session: \\"I suspect, that U.S. citizens, probably dual nationals, are being held in military detention facilities almost certainly overseas and maybe at home.\\" Following briefing from the plaintiffs and the government on the motion to stay, the Second Circuit granted the motion to stay the injunction pending resolution on the government's appeal. In the order granting the motion to stay, the court wrote: The court said it would consider arguments in the case on an expedited basis, and Judges Denny Chin, Raymond Lohier and Christopher Droney set a briefing schedule. Carl Mayer, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they disagree with the decision to stay the case but that \\"the appeals court is obviously taking this very seriously.\\" =Briefing and oral argument= On November 6, 2012, the government filed its opening brief in the Second Circuit. The government argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because \\"there is no actual or imminent injury to be redressed,\\" stating that plaintiffs had never been detained and face no threat of detention, and criticized Judge Forrest's interpretation of the term \\"associated forces,\\" writing: \\"The term is well understood to cover cobelligerent groups that fight together with al-Qaeda or Taliban forces in the armed conflict against the United States,\\" and it is not and cannot be \\"read to cover the types of unarmed advocacy organizations involved in this suit.\\" The government also noted that none of the plaintiffs allege having a fear of detention, nor have they offered any evidence of the U.S. military detaining journalists or advocates. The defendants added that there is no precedent for hearing a lawsuit to block the president in advance from conducting an armed conflict using congressionally conferred authority. The government also argued that war authorizations have historically been broad and that section 1021(b)(2) is more specific than other authorizations, therefore it should not be subject to a First Amendment or due process vagueness challenge. Hedges and the other plaintiffs-appellants filed their appeal brief on December 10, 2012. In an article in December 24, 2012, Hedges opined that unless the courts ruled in his favor, \\"a gulag state will be cemented into place.\\" He further voiced his opinion, provided that the Second Court of Appeals upholds Judge Forrest's ruling, the case will most likely be before the Supreme Court within weeks. Oral argument was heard before the Second Circuit on February 6, 2013, The dominating topic at oral argument was press rights. before a three-judge panel composed of Judges Raymond J. Lohier, Lewis A. Kaplan and Amalya Lyle Kearse). At oral argument, U.S. government attorney Robert Loeb argued that journalists had nothing to fear from the NDAA because it represented no change in law since the September 11, 2001 attacks, pointing to NDAA Section 1021(e), which states: \\"Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.\\" In response to questioning from the court, Loeb stated that independent journalists had no reason to fear detention from the NDAA \\"and would not be treated as combatants unless there was evidence they were only using journalism as a cover and were in fact members of a designated enemy group.\\" Afran, the lawyer for Hedges and the other plaintiffs, countered that a number of ostensibly protected activities could fall under the NDAA's ill-defined language on \\"substantial support\\" for terrorism: \\"For example, raising money for Guantanamo inmates. Is that substantial support? ... Hosting a webcast with al-Qaida members. Is that substantial support?\\" He also argued that plaintiffs had legal standing to challenge Section 1021(b)(2) because it interfered with plaintiffs' right to free speech by creating a basis to fear that they might be placed in military detention on the basis of their activities. Loeb argued that plaintiffs had failed to show an \\"objectively reasonable fear of being placed in long-term detention\\" and that it was \\"not reasonable\\" for independent journalists or activists to expect detention under NDAA, since \\"we have about a decade of experience, and we have nobody being held for acts of independent journalism.\\" While the case was pending in the Second Circuit, the Supreme Court ruled on Clapper v. Amnesty International USA in February 2013. The U.S. government filed a letter with the Second Circuit arguing that, like the Clapper plaintiffs, the Hedges plaintiffs could not \\"establish a present or 'certainly impending' injury-in-fact\\" because that the NDAA's detention provisions, like the NSA warrantless wiretapping authorization, merely permitted rather than required the government to take a particular action. The government argued that Clapper supported its argument that dismissal of the Hedges suit was required due to lack of standing. The Hedges plaintiffs responded in mid-March 2013, arguing that Clapper had \\"factual and legal predicates differ dramatically from those in the instant appeal and have only superficial similarities to Hedges,\\" and seeking supplemental briefing and argument. The government responded on April 4, 2013. On April 24, 2013, the Second Circuit denied the Hedges plaintiffs' motion for supplemental briefing and argument on the affect of Clapper.Hedges: CA2 Refuses Supplemental Briefing and Argument On Issues Arising From Clapper, Lawfare (April 25, 2013). =Second Circuit's ruling = In a 3-0 ruling issued on July 13, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned Judge Forrest's ruling striking down Section 1021(b)(2) and lifted the injunction. The court of appeals held that Hedges and the other plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge the law. In a 60-page opinion written by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan (who sat with the Second Circuit by designation) the court held that Hedges and his American co- plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the indefinite detention provisions of Section 1021 because a subsection of the section, Section 1021(e), made clear that the statute \\"simply says nothing about the government's authority to detain citizens.\\"Hedges v. Obama, 724 F. 3d 170 (2d Cir. 2013). The court held that while Section 1021 could have been drafted more clearly, Section 1021(e) made clear that \\"with respect to citizens, lawful resident aliens, or individuals captured or arrested in the United States, Section 1021 simply says nothing at all.\\" The court added that section 1021 \\"does not foreclose the possibility that previous 'existing law' may permit the detention of American citizens,\\" citing as an example Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S. citizen detained after allegedly fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. With respect to the non-citizen plaintiffs, such as J√≥nsd√≥ttir of Iceland and Kai Wargalla of Germany, the court determined that \\"while Section 1021 does have a real bearing on those who are neither citizens nor lawful resident aliens and who are apprehended abroad,\\" the foreign plaintiffs also \\"failed to establish standing because they have not shown a sufficient threat that the government will detain them under Section 1021.\\" The court held that \\"plaintiffs have provided no basis for believing that the government will place Jonsdottir and Wargalla in military detention for their supposed substantial support. In all the circumstances, plaintiffs have not shown a sufficient threat of enforcement to establish standing. Moreover, they cannot'\\"manufacture standing' based on any present injuries incurred due to their expressed fears.\\" The court \\"express[ed] no view regarding whether the laws of war inform and limit detention authority under Section 1021(b)(2) or whether such principles would foreclose the detention of individuals like Jonsdottir and Wargalla\\" and stated: \\"This issue presents important questions about the scope of the government's detention authority under the AUMF, and we are wary of allowing a preenforcement standing inquiry to become the vehicle by which a court addresses these matters unless it is necessary. Because we conclude that standing is absent in any event, we will assume without deciding that Section 1021(b)(2) covers Jonsdottir and Wargalla in light of their stated activities.\\" The Second Circuit vacated the permanent injunction and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with its ruling. Bruce Afran, a lawyer for Hedges, said the ruling \\"continues a distressing trend in which American federal courts are refusing to rule in cases where the U.S. government is over-reaching and violating civil liberties.\\" The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office, which represents the government in the case, declined to comment. U.S. Supreme Court proceedings In December 2012, Hedges and the other plaintiffs in the case filed an \\"Emergent Application to Vacate Temporary Stay of Permanent Injunction,\\" seeking to vacate the Second Circuit's stay of the permanent injunction. The application was denied by the court in December 2012, and in February 2013. In September 2013, Hedges announced the plaintiffs would file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court, asking that court to review the Second Circuit's ruling. The U.S. government filed in March 2014 a brief in opposition to the plaintiff's petition for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in an order issued April 28, 2014.

An entirely self-taught artist, he first appeared as an exhibitor in London in 1760, and between that date and 1773 exhibited twenty-five works with the Incorporated Society of Artists and one with the Free Society. Works One of Wright's earliest known works is a picture of the St Nicholas Church, Liverpool, known as 'The Sailor's Church', and where Wright himself was probably baptised. The scene depicts the church and surrounding buildings viewed across the River Mersey from \\"Man's Island\\". It was one of several works originally executed by Wright for his shoemaker. Wright first came to public attention 1762 after when he regularly exhibited at the Society of Artists until 1773. Exhibited works included A Storm with a Shipwreck, Sunset, a Fresh Breeze, A Fresh Gale, River with Boats, &c.;, Moonlight. The latter is thought to be A moonlit river landscape with a windmill, boats and figures, exhibited between 1770 and 1773 and sold at Christie's, London, in 2012 for ¬£6000. In 1764 a fifty guinea premium was offered by the Society of Arts for the best marine picture; this he won, as was the case with similar prizes given by the society in 1766 and 1768. Wright's career encompassed the latter years of the Seven Years' War and several of his works depict naval battles and the vessels involved. His painting of the Battle of Quiberon Bay, fought on 20 November 1759 and painted in 1760, depicts the wrecked 74-gun in the right foreground with the 64-gun ahead of her and the French and in flames in the right distance. To the left are the captured French 80-gun , with a two-deck English vessel. Wright painted a scene from the action off the Isle of Man that took place on the 28 February 1760 in which under John Elliot, with and , attacked a French squadron under Fran√ßois Thurot aboard the flagship that resulted in Thurot's death and the surrender of all three French frigates. Wright also painted an accompanying picture of the ships in Ramsey Bay after the action. Measuring by , the paintings were engraved by Millar and Goldar and dedicated to Captain Elliot and the Merchants of the Port of Liverpool respectively. Wright is noted as having been on board the Belle Isle sketching in the aftermath of the battle. In 1761 Wright painted several pictures of the storms encountered on the journey from Stade to Harwich of the Royal Yacht Fubbs that conveyed Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz to England to marry George III. One in the Royal Collection at Hampton Court Palace, The Royal Yacht bringing Queen Charlotte to England in a Storm is thought to be the picture first exhibited by Wright in 1762 as A View of the Storm when the Queen was on her passage to England. The flotilla was led by Admiral Lord Anson aboard the and his wife, Mary, accompanied Princess Charlotte aboard the Fubbs. Joshua Reynolds painted separate portraits of both Anson and his wife and Wright contributed background detail to each of them. The version of Anson's portrait in the National Gallery pre-dates Wright's intervention. 'Favourite' and 'Active' taking 'Hermione' In 1762 Wright painted a picture depicting the capture of the by the 28-gun frigate and the 18-gun sloop-of-war off the coast of Spain near the port of Cadiz in the action of 31 May 1762. The original version of The Fishery by Richard Wright The Fishery engraved by William Woollett, after Richard Wright His most notable work is a sea-piece, for which he obtained a premium of fifty guineas in 1764; from it William Woollett engraved his fine plate ‚ÄòThe Fishery.‚Äô No doubt owing to excellence of the engraver's work, a copy of this was published in France, on which the name of Vernet was affixed as painter. The ship has been identified as . The engraving embellishes the original painting, adding the words \\"Fish Machine\\" to a horse- drawn fish cart in the detail of the foreground fishing scene from which the popular name derives. Around 1767 Wright painted Man of War in a Harbour depicting a Man-of-War of about 60 guns flying an Admiral's flag departing from harbour led by several more distant similar-sized ships and smaller craft in line ahead formation. The ship's figurehead, viewed from the rear, appears to be of a figure wearing kilt and glengarry, suggesting a Scottish name, but the ship has yet to be identified. Like The Fishery, the foreground detail depicts fishermen unloading their catch. The detail of the fish is sufficient to identify the species. Sold by Wright to Jervoise Clarke for sixty guineas the painting remained in the family collection until sold at auction in 1975. It was purchased by the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, in 2006. An indistinctly-dated oil on panel entitled Shipping in a bay by a ruined tower was sold by Christie's, New York, in 2007 for $2500. Personal Sources vary in their estimates of Wright's year of birth. Bryan, who many other sources draw on, states 1735, but an article in The Connoisseur observes that this was probably too late, as he would only have been eighteen on the birth of his eldest son. It is probable that the 4 April 1723 baptismal entry for Richard Wright, son of Edward Wright, at St. Nicholas Church, Liverpool, relates to him. The following year Wright's longtime friend, artist George Stubbs, is also thought to have been baptised at St Nicholas. Wright was also a near neighbour of William Caddick. Richard initially worked as a house and ship painter and had no formal training as an artist. With little patronage for his trade in Liverpool, he moved to London around 1760, his address being recorded as 'Near King's Road, Pimlico'. There he was able to resume his friendship with Stubbs by 1762. He was described by Horace Walpole as a man of rough manners and warm temper, and during his membership of the Incorporated Society he took an active lead among those discontented with its affairs. With his wife, Louisa, Wright had a son, Edward, and two daughters: Nancy and Elizabeth. All three children were baptised at St Nicholas. Walpole noted that both Wright's wife and children all painted and exhibited, mostly still life and fruit pieces. Louisa, maiden name unknown, exhibited still lifes at the Society of Artists from 1770 to 1777. Edward, (baptised 10 April 1746), and Nancy (born 29 May 1748, baptised 24 June) both exhibited landscapes at the Society of Artists in 1772 and 1773. Elizabeth (born 25 March 1751, baptised 26 April) exhibited landscapes at the Society of Artists between 1773 and 1776. The family friendship with Stubbs is evidenced by Elizabeth's use of Stubbs' address, 24 Somerset Street, Portman Square, on some of her submissions for exhibition. Edward pre-deceased his father, aged about twenty. Wright died soon afterwards, following an unsuccessful exhibition in York about the same time as his son's death, in about 1775 and was survived by his wife.

This then saw him called up to the Chinese under-20 national team where he was part of the squad that took part in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, which China were knocked-out in the group stages. After the tournament Li Jian finished his training in Brazil and returned to the Bayi Football Team where he graduated to their senior team, however to gain playing time he was loaned out to second tier club Changchun Yatai F.C. in 2000. In the 2001 league season Li Jian returned to Bayi where he would fight for the goalkeeping position with his former Chinese under-20 teammate Li Leilei as the club finished twelfth at the end of the season. The following season Li Leilei was selected as the first team goalkeeper as Li Jian was dropped to the bench, which saw him move to top tier club Chongqing Lifan F.C. where he gradually established himself as the team's first choice goalkeeper.

He tries to prove the young man innocent of the charges, but when he is appointed sheriff, he is obliged to track down and arrest the boy. A 16mm reduction positive print exists of this film. Plot On his way to Steer City, Buddy Hale (Gary Cooper) rescues Janet Lane (Betty Jewel) from a runaway horse. Unknown to Buddy, the woman's brother Ward (Jack Luden) just shot the sheriff. Heading a ring of indignant ranchers whose cattle are being systematically rustled, Ward suspects that the sheriff and Justice Bert Wagner are leading the gang of thieves. Justice Wagner makes Buddy sheriff and sends him to arrest his predecessor's murderer. Soon after, Ward is deliberately shot by one of Wagner's accomplices, and Buddy returns the dying man to his sister. Thinking that Buddy shot him, she resents the new lawman. Later, Janet leads the other ranchers and steals back their cattle. At Chick's insistence, Janet discusses the situation with Buddy, who is convinced of Wagner's guilt.

It champions low-income and other marginalised groups living in cities as experts on urban poverty, and as actors capable of contributing to urban development.  Aims and practices  ACHR focuses on supporting the establishment and development of grassroots organisations of the urban poor, who can effectively advocate on housing and land reform. These organisations are typically formed around neighbourhood-level savings groups. ACHR equips these organisations with technical support, such as architects and urban planners who can help the urban poor to map their living conditions and draw up comprehensive site plans for upgrading or relocation projects. Communities will typically combine their savings in city development funds (CDFs), which allow them to leverage public finance from national and local governments, or even by international donors. This allows communities to take on much larger development projects. By linking residents of informal settlements at the settlement, city, country and regional scale, ACHR provides a channel for the urban poor to influence policy and programmes. In Thailand, for example, ACHR has helped low-income communities to negotiate land sharing or land leasing arrangements with local authorities and private landowners, and then to access low-cost housing loans and infrastructure subsidies to upgrade their neighbourhoods. The aim is to help landowners capture the commercial value of their land while reducing urban poverty and vulnerability. ACHR's emphasis on community finance should be distinguished from microfinance. Local groups collectively decide together how to use their savings to meet both public and private aims. The collective financial capital strengthens the group's social capital, and the two grow together. This collective aspect is not present in microfinance, where the emphasis is on individual access to credit and loan repayment, not on achieving collective priorities or addressing the structural issues that cause poverty and exclusion. ACHR has financed exchanges among informal settlements, cities and countries to allow the urban poor to share success stories and lessons learned across Asian cities. This allows successful innovations to be replicated, including city development funds.  Asian Coalition for Community Action  Central to ACHR's work over recent years has been the Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA), a fund supporting local organisations through professional exchanges and grants/loans in 165 cities and 19 Asian countries. The ACCA programme enabled the expansion and evolution of savings processes, so that local groups were able to offer more sophisticated financial products: longer-term savings for housing, interest-earning savings accounts, insurance/welfare schemes and loans for both individual livelihoods and community enterprises. In most countries, the ACCA savings process began with informal groups. However, more formal structures have been developed in many places. In Thailand, the savings groups have had to register as housing cooperatives, while in the Philippines, the savings groups have had to register as homeowners' associations or community associations. In Cambodia, the movement remains unregulated. In all cases, savings networks have sought to collaborate with multiple levels of government to influence land use zoning, service provision and building codes, as well as to negotiate access to land and subsidies.  Management  ACHR was established in 1989. The Secretariat is based in Bangkok.

It is the principal source of palm oil. It is native to west and southwest Africa, specifically the area between Angola and The Gambia; the species name guineensis refers to the name for the area, Guinea, and not the modern country which now bears that name. The species is also now naturalised in Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Central America, Cambodia, the West Indies, and several islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The closely related American oil palm Elaeis oleifera and a more distantly related palm, Attalea maripa, are also used to produce palm oil. Human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years in West Africa; in the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered palm oil in a tomb at Abydos dating back to 3,000 BCE. It is thought that Arab traders brought the oil palm to Egypt. The first western person to describe it and bring back seeds was the French naturalist Michel Adanson.Jean-Marie Pelt, ¬´ Michel Adanson, le baobab et les coquillages ¬ª, dans La Cannelle et le panda : les grands naturalistes explorateurs autour du Monde, Fayard, 1999 . Oil palm trees can produce much more oil per unit land area than other oil plants (about nine time more than soy and 4.5 times more than rapeseed). See especially this graph. Description Mature palms are single-stemmed and grow to tall. The leaves are pinnate and reach long. A young palm produces about 30 leaves a year. Established palms over 10 years produce about 20 leaves a year. The flowers are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals. The palm fruit takes 5‚Äì6 months to develop from pollination to maturity. It is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single seed (the palm kernel), also rich in oil. When ripe, each bunch of fruit weighs between depending on the age of the palm tree. Planting Oil palm fruit For each hectare of oil palm, which is harvested year-round, the annual production averages 20 tonnes of fruit yielding of palm oil and of seed kernels yielding of high-quality palm kernel oil, as well as of kernel meal. Kernel meal is processed for use as livestock feed. All modern, commercial planting material consists of tenera palms or DxP hybrids, which are obtained by crossing thickshelled dura with shell-less pisifera. Although common commercial germinated seed is as thick- shelled as the dura mother palm, the resulting palm will produce thin-shelled tenera fruit. An alternative to germinated seed, once constraints to mass production are overcome, are tissue-cultured or \\"clonal\\" palms, which provide \\"true copies\\" of high-yielding DxP palms. Cross-breeding Unlike other relatives, oil palms do not produce offshoots; propagation is by sowing the seeds. Several varieties and forms of Elaeis guineensis have been selected that have different characteristics. These include: :::::*E. guineensis fo. dura :::::*E. guineensis var. pisifera :::::*E, guineensis fo. tenera Before the Second World War, selection work had started in the Deli dura population in Malaya. Pollen was imported from Africa, and DxT and DxP crosses were made. Segregation of fruit forms in crosses made in the 1950s was often incorrect. In the absence of a good marker gene, there was no way of knowing whether control of pollination was adequate. After the work of Beirnaert and Vanderweyen (1941), it became feasible to monitor the efficacy of controlled pollination. From 1963 until the introduction of the palm-pollinating weevil Elaeidobius kamerunicus in 1982, contamination in Malaysia's commercial plantings was generally low. Thrips, the main pollinating agent at that time, apparently rarely gained access to bagged female inflorescences. However, E. kamerunicus is much more persistent, and after it was introduced, Deli dura contamination became a significant problem. This problem apparently persisted for much of the 1980s, but in a 1991 comparison of seed sources, contamination had been reduced to below 2%, indicating control had been restored. A 1992 study at a trial plot in Banting, Selangor, revealed the \\"yield of Deli dura oil palms after four generations of selection was 60% greater than that of the unselected base population. Crossing the dura and pisifera to give the thin- shelled tenera fruit type improved partitioning of dry matter within the fruit, giving a 30% increase in oil yield at the expense of shell, without changing total dry matter production.\\" In 2013, the gene responsible for controlling shell thickness was discovered, making it possible to verify tenera (DxP) status while palms are still in the nursery. Disease Basal stem rot (BSR), caused by the fungus Ganoderma, is the most serious disease of oil palm in Malaysia and Indonesia. Previously, research on basal stem rot was hampered by the failure to artificially infect oil palms with the fungus. Although Ganoderma had been associated with BSR, proof of its pathogenicity to satisfy Koch's postulate was only achieved in the early 1990s by inoculating oil palm seedling roots or by using rubber wood blocks. A reliable and quick technique was developed for testing the pathogenicity of the fungus by inoculating oil palm germinated seeds. This fatal disease can lead to losses as much as 80% after repeated planting cycles. Ganoderma produces enzymes that degrade the infected xylem, thus causing serious problems to the distribution of water and other nutrients to the top of the palm. Ganoderma infection is well defined by its lesion in the stem. The cross-section of infected palm stem shows that the lesion appears as a light brown area of rotting tissue with a distinctive, irregularly shaped, darker band at the borders of this area.Turner PD. Palm oil Diseases and Disorders. Oxford University Press, 1981. The infected tissue become as an ashen-grey powdery and if the palm remains standing, the infected trunk rapidly become hollow. In a 2007 study in Portugal, scientists suggested control of the fungus on oil palms would benefit from further consideration of the process as one of white rot. Ganoderma is an extraordinary organism capable exclusively of degrading lignin to carbon dioxide and water; celluloses are then available as nutrients for the fungus. It is necessary to consider this mode of attack as a white rot involving lignin biodegradation, for integrated control. The existing literature does not report this area and appears to be concerned particularly with the mode of spread and molecular biology of Ganoderma. The white rot perception opens up new fields in breeding/selecting for resistant cultivars of oil palms with high lignin content, ensuring the conditions for lignin decomposition are reduced, and simply sealing damaged oil palms to stop decay. The spread likely is by spores rather than roots. The knowledge gained can be employed in the rapid degradation of oil palm waste on the plantation floor by inoculating suitable fungi, and/or treating the waste more appropriately (e.g. chipping and spreading over the floor rather than windrowing). Endophytic bacteria are organisms inhabiting plant organs that at some time in their life cycles can colonize the internal plant tissues without causing apparent harm to the host. Introducing endophytic bacteria to the roots to control plant disease is to manipulate the indigenous bacterial communities of the roots in a manner, which leads to enhanced suppression of soil-borne pathogens. The use of endophytic bacteria should thus be preferred to other biological control agents, as they are internal colonizers, with better ability to compete within the vascular systems, limiting Ganoderma for both nutrients and space during its proliferation. Two bacterial isolates, Burkholderia cepacia(B3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(P3) were selected for evaluation in the glasshouse for their efficacy in enhancing growth and subsequent suppression of the spread of BSR in oil palm seedlings. Little leaf syndrome has not been fully explained, but has often been confused with boron deficiency. The growing point is damaged, sometimes by Oryctes beetles. Small, distorted leaves resembling a boron deficiency emerge. This is often followed by secondary pathogenic infections in the spear that can lead to spear rot and palm death. History Oil palms were introduced to Java by the Dutch in 1848, and to Malaysia (then the British colony of Malaya) in 1910 by Scotsman William Sime and English banker Henry Darby. The species of palm tree Elaeis guineensis was taken to Malaysia from Eastern Nigeria in 1961. As noted it originally grew in West Africa. The southern coast of Nigeria was originally called the Palm oil coast by the first Europeans who arrived there and traded in the commodity. This area was later renamed the Bight of Biafra. In traditional African medicine different parts of the plant are used as laxative and diuretic, as a poison antidote, as a cure for gonorrhea, menorrhagia, and bronchitis, to treat headaches and rheumatism, to promote healing of fresh wounds and treat skin infections. In Cambodia, this palm was introduced as a decorative plant in public gardens, its Khmer name is d√¥√¥:ng pr√©ing (doong=palm, preing=oil). =Malaysia= In Malaysia, the first plantations were mostly established and operated by British plantation owners, such as Sime Darby and Boustead, and remained listed in London until the Malaysian government engineered their \\"Malaysianisation\\" throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) is the world's biggest oil palm planter, with planted area close to 900,000 hectares in Malaysia and Indonesia. Felda was formed on July 1, 1956 when the Land Development Act came into force with the main aim of eradicating poverty. Settlers were each allocated 10 acres of land (about 4 hectares) planted either with oil palm or rubber, and given 20 years to pay off the debt for the land. After Malaysia achieved independence in 1957, the government focused on value-added of rubber planting, boosting exports, and alleviating poverty through land schemes. In the 1960s and 1970s, the government encouraged planting of other crops, to cushion the economy when world prices of tin and rubber plunged. Rubber estates gave way to oil palm plantations. In 1961, Felda's first oil palm settlement opened, with 3.75 km¬≤ of land. As of 2000, 6855.2 km¬≤ (approximately 76%) of the land under Felda's programmes were devoted to oil palms.Simeh, Arif & Tengku Ahmad, Tengku Mohd. Ariff (2001). \\"The Case Study on the Malaysian Palm Oil\\" By 2008, Felda's resettlement broadened to 112,635 families, who work on 8533.13 km¬≤ of agriculture land throughout Malaysia. Oil palm planting took up 84% of Felda's plantation landbank. FELDA's success led to the establishment of other development schemes to support the establishment of small-farmer oil palm cultivation. The Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) was established in 1966 and the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (SALCRA) was formed in 1976. The primary objective of these organizations is to assist in the development of rural communities and reduce poverty through the cultivation of high yielding crops such as palm oil. , SALCRA had developed 18 estates totalling approximately 51,000 hectares. That year the organization shared dividends with 16,374 landowners participating in the program. Palm oil production Fruit of the oil palm Oil is extracted from both the pulp of the fruit (palm oil, an edible oil) and the kernel (palm kernel oil, used in foods and for soap manufacture). For every 100 kg of fruit bunches, typically 22 kg of palm oil and 1.6 kg of palm kernel oil can be extracted. The high oil yield of oil palms (as high as 7,250 liters per hectare per year) has made it a common cooking ingredient in Southeast Asia and the tropical belt of Africa. Its increasing use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is buoyed by its cheaper pricing, the high oxidative stability of the refined product, and high levels of natural antioxidants. The oil palm originated in West Africa, but has since been planted successfully in tropical regions within 20 degrees of the equator. In the Republic of the Congo, or Congo Brazzaville, precisely in the Northern part, not far from Ouesso, local people produce this oil by hand. They harvest the fruit, boil it to let the water evaporate, then press what is left to collect the reddish-orange-colored oil. In 1995, Malaysia was the world's largest producer, with a 51% of world share, but since 2007, Indonesia has been the world's largest producer, supplying approximately 50% of world palm oil volume. Worldwide palm oil production for season 2011/2012 was 50.3 million metric tons, increasing to 52.3 million tons for 2012/13. In 2010/2011, total production of palm kernels was 12.6 million tonnes. In 2019 total production was 75,7 mln tonnes The Urhobo people of Nigeria use the extract to make Amiedi soup. Oil palm research Key scientific journals publishing on oil palms and related topics include:Google Scholar. Accessed: June 27, 2013. * Journal of Oil Palm Research (JOPR) * Journal of Applied Polymer Science * Conservation Letters * Bioresource Technology * Trends in Ecology and Evolution Social and environmental impacts The social and environmental impacts of oil palm cultivation is a highly controversial topic. Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a major source of employment. It allows many small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in the upgrade of the infrastructure (schools, roads, telecommunications) within that area. However, there are cases where native customary lands have been appropriated by oil palm plantations without any form of consultation or compensation, leading to social conflict between the plantations and local residents. In some cases, oil palm plantations are dependent on imported labour or illegal immigrants, with some concerns about the employment conditions and social impacts of these practices. Biodiversity loss (including the potential extinction of charismatic species) is one of the most serious negative effects of oil palm cultivation. Large areas of already threatened tropical rainforest are often cleared to make way for palm oil plantations, especially in Southeast Asia, where enforcement of forest protection laws is lacking. In some states where oil palm is established, lax enforcement of environmental legislation leads to encroachment of plantations into protected areas, encroachment into riparian strips, open burning of plantation wastes, and release of palm mill pollutants such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) in the environment. Some of these states have recognised the need for increased environmental protection, resulting in more environment- friendly practices. Among those approaches is anaerobic treatment of POME, which can be a good source for biogas (methane) production and electricity generation. Anaerobic treatment of POME has been practiced in Malaysia and Indonesia. Like most wastewater sludge, anaerobic treatment of POME results in dominance of Methanosaeta concilii. It plays an important role in methane production from acetate, and the optimum condition for its growth should be considered to harvest biogas as renewable fuel. Demand for palm oil has increased in recent years due to its use as a biofuel, but recognition that this increases the environmental impact of cultivation, as well as causing a food vs fuel issue, has forced some developed nations to reconsider their policies on biofuel to improve standards and ensure sustainability. However, critics point out that even companies signed up to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil continue to engage in environmentally damaging practices and that using palm oil as biofuel is perverse because it encourages the conversion of natural habitats such as forests and peatlands, releasing large quantities of greenhouse gases. =Carbon balance= Oil palm production has been documented as a cause of substantial and often irreversible damage to the natural environment. Its impacts include deforestation, habitat loss of critically endangered species,Cooking the Climate Greenpeace UK Report, November 15, 2007Once a Dream, Palm Oil May Be an Eco-Nightmare The New York Times, January 31, 2007 and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions.Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group I \\"The Physical Science Basis\\" , Section 7.3.3.1.5 (p. 527), IPCC, Retrieved 4 May 2008 The pollution is exacerbated because many rainforests in Indonesia and Malaysia lie atop peat bogs that store great quantities of carbon, which are released when the forests are cut down and the bogs are drained to make way for the plantations. Environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, claim the deforestation caused by making way for oil palm plantations is far more damaging for the climate than the benefits gained by switching to biofuel. Fresh land clearances, especially in Borneo, are contentious for their environmental impact.Palm oil warning for Indonesia BBC 8 November 2007BBC Losing land to palm oil in Kalimantan BBC News, 3 August 2007 Despite thousands of square kilometres of land standing unplanted in Indonesia, tropical hardwood forests are being cleared for palm oil plantations. Furthermore, as the remaining unprotected lowland forest dwindles, developers are looking to plant peat swamp land, using drainage that begins an oxidation process of the peat which can release 5,000 to 10,000 years worth of stored carbon. Drained peat is also at very high risk of forest fire. There is a clear record of fire being used to clear vegetation for oil palm development in Indonesia, where in recent years drought and man-made clearances have led to massive uncontrolled forest fires, covering parts of Southeast Asia in haze and leading to an international crisis with Malaysia. These fires have been blamed on a government with little ability to enforce its own laws, while impoverished small farmers and large plantation owners illegally burn and clear forests and peat lands to develop the land rather than reap the environmental benefits it could offer.No Easy Solution To Indonesian Haze Problem AFP 20 April 2007 Forest Fires Sweep Indonesian Borneo and Sumatra VOA news Many of the major companies in the vegetable oil economy participate in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which is trying to address this problem. For example, in 2008, Unilever, a member of the group, committed to use only oil palm oil which is certified as sustainable, by ensuring the large companies and smallholders that supply it convert to sustainable production by 2015. Unilever commits to sustainable palm oil Food Navigator.com 2 May 2008 Meanwhile, much of the recent investment in new palm plantations for biofuel has been funded through carbon credit projects through the Clean Development Mechanism; however, the reputational risk associated with the unsustainable palm plantations in Indonesia has now made many funds wary of such investment.Carbon market takes sides in palm oil battle Carbon Finance, 20 November 2007 =Palm biomass as fuel= Some scientists and companies are going beyond using just the oil, and are proposing to convert fronds, empty fruit bunches and palm kernel shells harvested from oil palm plantations into renewable electricity, Malaysian National News Agency, 6 February 2007 cellulosic ethanol,Celluosic ethanol from processing and plantation waste Budi Oil Holdings Sdn. Bhd company promotional literature biogas,Biogas Clean Development Mechanism: recovery and electricity generation from Palm Oil Mill Effluent ponds, UNFCCC CDM register biohydrogen and bioplastic.Biodegradable Plastics Production from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) Delft University of Technology Thus, by using both the biomass from the plantation as well as the processing residues from palm oil production (fibers, kernel shells, palm oil mill effluent), bioenergy from palm plantations can have an effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples of these production techniques have been registered as projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism. By using palm biomass to generate renewable energy, fuels and biodegradable products, both the energy balance and the greenhouse gas emissions balance for palm biodiesel is improved. For every tonne of palm oil produced from fresh fruit bunches, a farmer harvests around 6 tonnes of waste palm fronds, 1 tonne of palm trunks, 5 tonnes of empty fruit bunches, 1 tonne of press fiber (from the mesocarp of the fruit), half a tonne of palm kernel endocarp, 250 kg of palm kernel press cake, and 100 tonnes of palm oil mill effluent. Some oil palm plantations incinerate biomass to generate power for palm oil mills. Some other oil palm plantations yield large amount of biomass that can be recycled into medium density fibreboards and light furniture.Biomass Utilization in Malaysia National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST, Japan) In efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, scientists treat palm oil mill effluent to extract biogas. After purification, biogas can substitute for natural gas for use at factories. Anaerobic treatment of palm oil mill effluent, practiced in Malaysia and Indonesia, results in domination of Methanosaeta concilii. It plays an important role in methane production from acetate and the optimum condition for its growth should be considered to harvest biogas as renewable fuel. Unfortunately, the production of palm oil has detrimental effects on the environment and is not considered to be a sustainable biofuel. The deforestation occurring throughout Malaysia and Indonesia as a result of the growing demand for this plant has made scarce natural habitats for orangutans and other rainforest dwellers. More carbon is released during the life cycle of a palm oil plant to its use as a biofuel than is emitted by the same volume of fossil fuels.

His father was the second James Templer (1748‚Äì1813) who had built the Stover Canal. He inherited the Stover estate in Teigngrace, Devon on the death of his father, but left its running to his lawyer, preferring to spend his time hunting, writing poetry, and in amateur dramatics. He lived with a mistress and had six children by her before running into financial difficulties and selling his entire estate to the Duke of Somerset. He later built himself a house on the outskirts of Newton Abbot and married the daughter of Sir John Kennaway in 1835. He died in 1843 after a hunting accident. Personal life George Templer was born in 1781, the eldest son of the second James Templer. He was educated at Westminster, and inherited the Stover estate on his father's death in 1813. Noted for his kindness, his hospitality and for his lavish lifestyle, his interests lay in poetry, amateur dramatics, field sports and cricket rather than business, which he mostly left to his lawyer and others. Before 1815 he fell in love with Ann Wreford, the daughter of a nearby farmer, who moved in with him and bore him six children, although they were not married. From the early 1800s, Templer was involved in the breeding and training of beagles, and he was master of the first regular hunt in South Devon, which he founded in about 1810. He was an early friend of Jack Russell, \\"The Sporting Parson\\", and taught him much about fox-hounds. In 1820 he was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the South Devon Yeomanry. He was also a pioneer of cricket and was one of the founders of Teignbridge Cricket Club in 1823. Templer was fond of entertaining at Stover House: his guests included Sarah Siddons and \\"Mr. Kemble\\", who were said to have praised his and his family and servants' performance of Shakespeare. In the later 1820s Templer ran into financial difficulties, considered today to be due mainly to his extravagant lifestyle and his lack of business acumen, though he himself blamed his downfall on the dishonesty of a lawyer, about whom he wrote a bitter poem entitled \\"The Attorney\\", the first verse of which runs:Reproduced in full in: Friends! neighbours! countrymen! / I take the liberty to warn ye, / Against that universal scourge, / A rascally Attorney. He was forced to sell his pack of hounds in 1826, meaning that the South Devon Hunt did not meet in 1826/7. This led him to write a poem to his old hunting horn which he recited at a meeting of sportsmen in Chulmleigh under the chairmanship of the Hon. Newton Fellowes.The poem is set out in full in In January 1829 he sold his entire estate including the Stover Canal and the Haytor Granite Tramway to the 11th Duke of Somerset. On leaving the estate for the last time he wrote the following: Stover, farewell! Still fancy's hand shall trace Thy pleasures past in all their former grace; And I will wear and cherish, though we part, The dear remembrance ever at my heart. Not as the hare whom hounds and horn pursue In timid constancy I cling to you; But, like the bolder chase, resolved, I fly, That where I may not live I will not die. He went abroad, but returned to the area before 1833 and built Sandford Orleigh house on the outskirts of Newton Abbot. In 1835 he married Charlotte Kennaway, daughter of Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet of Escot House. At Sandford Orleigh he had a set of early-16th-century carved oak screens made into an ornamental overmantel: this was donated to Newton Abbot museum in 2008, after being removed from the house when it was converted into flats. The overmantel had suffered some damage, but it was restored and is now on display in the museum. Templer died at Sandford Orleigh on 12 December 1843 after a hunting accident. There is a mural monument to him in Teigngrace church. Business interests Templer built the Haytor Granite Tramway that ran for from his granite quarries at Haytor to the head of the Stover Canal that had been constructed by his father. It may have been the winning of a contract to provide granite for John Rennie's rebuilding of London Bridge that led Templer to develop the tramway; light grey \\"Devonshire Haytor\\" granite was specified, along with two Scottish granites, by the Act of Parliament that authorised the new bridge. The tramway was opened on 16 September 1820 with a great celebration at Haytor at which Templer gave a \\"short and energetic speech, which excited bursts of applause\\"., quoting Exeter Flying Post of 21 September 1820. In 1825 Templer formed the Company of the Proprietors of the Devon Haytor Quarries, which soon became a joint-stock company, with capital of ¬£200,000 and offices in Broad Street, London. He built accommodation for the quarry workers near to his quarries, including in 1825‚Äì6 a row of houses and a hostel (now the Rock Inn) at Haytor Vale. The Duke of Somerset, who owned the land, was paid ¬£200 a year by the company for the right to extend its quarrying to 600 acres, though it actually only ever used 90 acres. The company was soon providing several thousand tons of granite a year for buildings such as the British Museum, the National Gallery, and many others. The granite was also used for more prosaic and local uses such as kerbstones, pavements and setts for road surfaces. Teignmouth New Quay in 1827 showing blocks of cut Haytor granite awaiting transport After the granite was transferred from the tramway carriages to barges, the barges travelled down the Stover Canal and then down the Teign estuary to the port of Teignmouth. This traffic was in addition to the transport of ball clay that was still ongoing since the opening of the canal by Templer's father in 1792. To help with the transfer of the granite from the barges to ships for the next leg of the journey, Templer built a \\"New Quay\\" at Teignmouth in the early 1820s. Templer's business ventures were only able to support him for a short time: by the late 1820s he was in financial difficulties despite shipping 20,000 tons of clay and granite per annum down the canal. The difficulties with the granite business have been attributed to the strong competition that developed from other sources of granite, particularly in Cornwall, that did not need two transfers (tramway to canal barge, and barge to ship), as well as Templer's lack of business acumen, which was described by L. T. C. Rolt in 1974 as him being \\"incapable of answering letters or taking important decisions and equally unable to select reliable men for positions of trust in his ventures\\". After the sale of his assets to the Duke of Somerset, Templer became the chief Devon agent for the Haytor Granite company in the early 1830s, but he still caused problems for the company. For example, in 1833‚Äì4 questions were raised over whether he had properly retained the lease on the quarries, and the directors questioned his reticence in chasing up money owed and his willingness to sell the granite at far below its fair price.

Wings for My Flight documents Houle's observations of a pair of the then-endangered peregrine falcons at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in Colorado, while employed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the summer of 1975. To protect the falcons, Houle had to halt a million-dollar project to turn ancient Anasazi ruins in the area into a tourist attraction and faced opposition and harassment by the Chimney Rock community as a result. By 1975, peregrine falcons had been reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list. Wings for My Flight was originally published in hardcover by Addison-Wesley in 1991. The book was republished in 1999 by Pruett Publishing with a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. The book was updated again in 2014 and republished by the University of New Mexico Press with photographs and a preface by Houle touching upon the recovery of the peregrine falcon. In May 1996, the children's magazine Cricket published a short story written by Houle titled \\"Albert\\", adapted from Wings for My Flight. Reception to Wings for My Flight has generally been positive. The book co-received the Oregon Book Award in 1991 and received a Christopher Award for books in 1992. Background Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in the decades following a major decline in the peregrine falcon population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no peregrine falcons were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, peregrine falcon populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, the year in which the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of peregrine falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado. During the peregrine falcon decline, Houle studied biology at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block scheduling system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, allowing her to travel frequently to experience various ecosystems in addition to her academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe peregrine falcon activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there. The peregrine falcon became an endangered species primarily due to the use of organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female peregrine falcons and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since peregrine falcons lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells would break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list. Content summary Chimney Rock (far right), a prominent geological rock formation in Colorado where the majority of the book's events took place, photographed in 2010 The events of Wings for My Flight take place throughout 1975. Marcy Cottrell Houle (then \\"Marcy Cottrell\\"), a 21-year-old wildlife biologist, is sent by her supervisor, Barry Layne, to the U.S. Forest Service office near Chimney Rock in Colorado, where a pair of peregrine falcons reside. The pair is one of only seven pairs remaining in the Rocky Mountains region. Mr. Preston Fitch, an administrator involved with the peregrine falcon project, criticizes Houle for her lack of experience in the field upon meeting her. Nevertheless, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to Chimney Rock. He explains that the Forest Service spent more than half a million dollars building a road which led to Chimney Rock; work on the road had to be discontinued upon discovery of the falcons. Further, the Chimney Rock area is home to 250 Anasazi ruins dated between 900 and 1100. The Chimney Rock community had been planning a million-dollar development to build a tourist attraction for the ruins. Houle spends several weeks with the peregrine falcons, recording her observations in her notebook. In spite of her initial attempt at maintaining an impersonal relationship with the falcons, Houle names the female peregrine \\"Jenny\\" and the male \\"King Arthur\\". In the middle of June, after Houle had spent several days of making field observations alone and with limited equipment, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to her teammate, Alex Porter. He also provides them with a garbage truck for transportation. A juvenile American peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum), the same species as the ones observed by Houle at Chimney Rock, photographed in California, 2008 Meanwhile, Houle faces indignation and harassment from the residents of the Chimney Rock community, who view her presence as impeding the progress of the construction of a tourist attraction for the Anasazi ruins. At one point, Maurice Richards, a high-ranking official of the Colorado Division of Wildlife, attempts to host a picnic on an area restricted for the peregrines. When Houle forces him to leave, Richards threatens to fire her. Later, the female peregrine, Jenny, disappears and never returns. A local resident claims she was shot and killed by a member of the Chimney Rock community.As a result of Jenny's disappearance, King Arthur spends several days ignoring the hatchlings that they had been raising. After this period of \\"grief\\", King Arthur begins to raise the young falcons singlehandedly. Following this, Houle discovers that of five nestlings hatched by the pair, only two received enough food to survive. Houle names the surviving pair of nestlings \\"Bold Leopold\\" and \\"Albert\\" after their distinct personalities; Leopold was more courageous and was always the first to try new things, such as flying, whereas Albert was more hesitant. In spite of all the attempts to intimidate her, the people of Chimney Rock eventually sympathize with Houle after her trailer, containing valuable field equipment as well as personal items, is broken into and vandalized. Publication history Wings for My Flight was first published in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled \\"Albert\\" that was adapted from Wings for My Flight, focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for My Flight was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book was first published in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying \\"I felt more comfortable changing the names because I worked for so long with those people, it was impossible to be honest about them if I named them\\". Reception Wings for My Flight was generally well received. In 1991, the book received the Oregon Book Award for literary nonfiction, co-receiving the award with My Country, My Right to Serve by Mary Ann Humphrey. The Oregon Book Award, presented annually by Literary Arts, a non-profit organization that promotes literature, intends to recognize the works of Oregon-based authors in a variety of literary genres. Additionally, in 1992, the book received a Christopher Award, which is presented annually by The Christophers, a non- profit Christian inspirational group, and recognizes creators of books, motion pictures, and television specials that \\"affirm the highest values of the human spirit\\". Dolores and Roger Flaherty wrote a positive review in the Chicago Sun-Times, noting how \\"Houle blends elements of adventure, romance, humor and pathos in the story of her rookie summer as a wildlife biologist. Along the way she offers vivid descriptions of her skydiving subjects and the seductive beauty of the wilderness.\\" David M. Schwartz, in the May 1992 edition of Smithsonian, praised Houle's prose in Wings for My Flight, and wrote that the story is \\"told with a charming simplicity in fewer than 200 pages\\". Schwartz also praised Houle for including her notational system for documenting field observations, stating that it \\"opens a window on field biology\\". Writing in the Library Journal, Henry T. Armistead referred to the book as \\"well crafted and compelling, a dramatization of the classic conflict between the legitimate interests of conservationists and developers\\", and, \\"highly recommended on several levels, as science, sociology, or a story\\". Andrew Gulliford, a professor of history and environmental studies at Fort Lewis College, noted in The Durango Herald the significance of Houle's efforts to prevent \\"inappropriate development\\" at Chimney Rock, which was proclaimed a U.S. National Monument by President Barack Obama in 2012. \\"Wings for My Flight is a personal story\\", wrote Gulliford, \\"but also a chronicle of environmental success. Without a doubt, peregrines saved Chimney Rock for the rest of us.\\" Freehance writer Paul De Witte wrote a mixed review in The Record (now the Waterloo Region Record), writing that although the book \\"will certainly find its audience, its Disneyesque sensibilities will kill its broader appeal. The topics of wildlife conservation and global ecological accountability warrant a depth that the author seems unwilling to give her book.\\" Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as \\"an enlightening cautionary take\\" and \\"a charmingly personal account\\", but also as \\"loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail\\". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, \\"Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles to even the most stubbornly objective reader.\\" Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively \\"anthropomorphic\\", but also that \\"Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but to those of us who get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats.\\" References Further reading T.

It is used as an argumentation strategy by right-wing populist parties, which describes a rhetorical connection between the problems of the welfare state and, in essence, immigration, but also other social groups such as welfare recipients and the unemployed. The focus is placed on categorizing state residents in two extremes: the \\"nourishing\\" and \\"debilitating\\" and the contradiction between them in the competition for the society's scarce resources.  Background  The term welfare chauvinism was first used in social science in the 1990 paper \\"Structural changes and new cleavages: The progress parties in Denmark and Norway\\" by J√∏rgen Goul Andersen and Tor Bj√∏rklund. They described it as the notion that \\"welfare services should be restricted to our own\\".Linda Besner (7 February 2013): Why the Dutch Vote for Geert Wilders Randomhouse.ca, retrieved 31 July 2013J√∏rgen Gold Andersen and Tor Bj√∏rklund (1990): Structural changes and new cleavages: The progress parties in Denmark and Norway Acta Sociologica, JStor, retrieved 31 July 2013 \\"Nourishing\\" and \\"debilitating\\" In the description of society and the problems of the welfare state, populists, especially right-wing populists and welfare chauvinists, use a line of argument based on two extremes in which citizens are divided into 'nourishing' and 'debilitating' groups. The nourishing group consists of those who are a part of society's welfare and the country's prosperity: community builders; \\"the people\\"; the ordinary honest working man. The second group as standing outside of \\"the people\\" are the debilitating group, believed to be promoting or utilizing welfare without adding any value to society. The debilitating group consists of bureaucrats, academics, immigrants, the unemployed, welfare recipients and others. As such, welfare is seen as a system with embedded exclusion mechanisms. Right-wing populists and welfare chauvinism According to welfare chauvinists, the safety net of the welfare state are for those whom they believe belong in the community. By the right- wing populist standard, affiliations with society are based in national, cultural and ethnic or racial aspects. Considered to be included in the category are those that are regarded as nourishing. The debilitating group (primarily immigrants) is considered to be outside of society and to be unjustly utilizing the welfare system. In essence, welfare chauvinists consider immigration to be a drain on societal scarce resources. They believe these resources should be used for the ethnically homogeneous native population, preferably children and the elderly. The same principle of argument is, according to the academics Peer Scheepers, M√©rove Gijsberts and Marcel Coenders, transferred to the labor market; where the competition for jobs is made out to be an ethnic conflict between immigrants and the native population. In times of high unemployment this rhetorical coupling amplifies and enhances the legitimacy of the welfare chauvinist and other xenophobic arguments. Political Parties and welfare chauvinism Examples of contemporary political parties and groups that use, or used, a welfare chauvinist argumentation strategy: the Progress Party and Danish People's Party in Denmark, Front National in France, Freedom Party of Austria in Austria, The Republicans and Alternative for Germany in Germany, UK Independence Party in Britain, Sweden Democrats and New Democracy in Sweden, Golden Dawn in Greece, and One Nation in Australia.

It was dissolved in August 2017.  History  The new party was registered on 25 September 2012, and was launched two days later. In a Gallup poll in August 2012, it received 8% of the vote. Five MPs ‚Äì Gerhard K√∂fer of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ), Elisabeth Kaufmann-Bruckberger and Christoph Hagen of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ√ñ), and independents Robert Lugar and Erich Tadler ‚Äì agreed to join the party. Parties with at least three seats are automatically qualified to run in the forthcoming federal election. The party name, programme, and logo were decided in early September 2012. K√∂fer has been named as the party's leading candidate for the 2013 state election in Carinthia. In September's Gallup poll, it received 10% of the vote. At the party's campaign launch for the 2013 federal election, the party unveiled a political advertisement featuring personal endorsements for Stronach from Bill Clinton and Larry King. By this time, the party polled between 10% and 12%. After the defection of a fifth MP, Stefan Markowitz, Team Stronach was given official party status in the National Council: giving the party ‚Ç¨1.4m of state funding and places on parliamentary committees. The party won 11% of the vote in the March 2013 state election in Carinthia, only narrowly falling behind The Greens and the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP). On the same day, Team Stronach won 10% of the vote in the Lower Austria state election, in third place. The result in Lower Austria gave Team Stronach its first seat in the Federal Council, held by Gerald Zelina. On 29 September 2013 Team Stronach participated for the first time in the elections for the Austrian National Parliament. It got 5.73% of the votes and won 11 seats, being the fifth largest party in the new Austrian parliament.Nationalratswahl 2013, Austrian Ministry of the Interior The party did not contest the 2014 European parliamentary election. Since the election the party has fallen considerably in the polls. On 3 June 2015, two Stronach members of parliament defected to the √ñVP, leaving the party with nine deputies. In August 2017 the planned dissolution of the Team Stronach was announced for after the legislative election. Its MPs changed to the FP√ñ, the FL√ñ and the Whites.  Ideology  The Team Stronach supported Austria leaving the Euro currency and introducing an Austrian Euro instead. An advisor of the Team Stronach suggested later in an interview with news magazine \\"Format\\" that they wanted to keep the Euro but introduce additional national currencies. Unlike some other right-wing Eurosceptic parties, Stronach was not as opposed to immigration as others. The party advocated cutting bureaucracy and instituting a 25% flat-rate income tax. The Team Stronach supported ending conscription and introducing an all- volunteer army instead. Stronach supported electoral reform, including the use of primary elections.

The insurgency began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. The Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province groupThe Age, 16 February 2015: Egypt strikes back at Islamic State militants after beheading video, killing dozens and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. The Egyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, \\"unprecedented clashes\\" have occurred. The fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state- funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in a terrorist attack on a mosque west of the city of Al- Arish. In his first meeting with a Middle East nation since his confirmation as defense secretary, Mark Esper met with Egypt's Minister of Defense Mohammad Zaki and pressed him to use counterinsurgency-style tactics in the effort in the Sinai Peninsula. His Deputy for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said that he spoke to Minister Zaki extensively about their efforts in the Sinai and that it was clear they shared the belief in the importance of a population-centric approach to the counter-terrorism effort, even if it takes longer to be successful. Mulroy said he saw evidence of this during his visit to the Sinai where he spoke to both senior and junior military leaders. The fight in the Sinai forms part of the classified Irregular Warfare Annex to the National Defense Strategy, which calls on the Department of Defense to use foreign internal defense principles, advise and assist tactics, and influence operations. Background Sufism was previously dominant in the region before militant jihadi ideas began to take hold. The Sinai peninsula has long been known for its lawlessness, having historically served as a smuggling route for weapons and supplies. Security provisions in the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty of 1979 have institutionalized a diminished security presence in the area, enabling militants to operate with a freer hand. Moreover, the limited government-directed investment and development in Sinai has discriminated against the local Bedouin population, a population that values tribal allegiance over all else. The combination of Sinai's harsh terrain and lack of resources have kept the area poor and hence ripe for militancy. Following the January 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime, the country became increasingly destabilized, creating a security vacuum in the Sinai peninsula. Radical Islamic elements in Sinai exploited the opportunity, using the unique environment, in launching several waves of attacks upon Egyptian military and commercial facilities. According to The Economist, the conflict also involves local armed Bedouin \\"who have long-standing grievances against the central government in Cairo\\" and that \\"they are barred from joining the army or police; they find it hard to get jobs in tourism; and they complain that many of their lands have been taken from them\\". Timeline =2011‚Äì2012= Since the 2011 uprising against the Mubarak regime in Egypt, there has been increasing instability in the Sinai Peninsula. In addition the collapse of the Libyan regime increased the quantity and sophistication of weapons being smuggled into the area. The situation provided local Bedouin with an opportunity to assert their authority, leading to clashes with Egyptian security forces, but the cause of violence soon transitioned to salafi jihadism. Hard-line militant Muslims used Sinai as a launch-point for attacks against Israel and turned on the Egyptian state, focusing on Egypt's security establishment and the Sinai's Arab Gas Pipeline. Operation Eagle In August 2011, Operation Eagle was launched, in an effort to restore law and order, driving Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs out of North Sinai's urban centers. As well as, attempting to sever the link between militant groups in the Sinai and Gaza, by augmenting its control over the Gaza border crossing. The operation had limited success, and a week into the operation, Salafi jihadists carried out the biggest cross-border attack on Israel in the post-Mubarak period. Operation Sinai On 5 August 2012, an attack on the Rafah barracks shook the Egyptian military and population. Only a month into his term, President Mohamed Morsi sacked the longstanding defence minister and promoted General al Sisi to take his place. Operation Sinai was launched, aimed at eliminating armed Islamist groups, protecting the Suez Canal, and destroying the tunnel network connecting the Sinai with the Gaza Strip. During the operation, 32 militants and suspects were killed and 38 arrested, while 2 civilians had been killed by early September 2012. =2013‚Äì2014= Since the July 2013 coup, against President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, the Egyptian military and security services in particular have been targeted by Sinai-based violent Islamist groups. In an increase in violence security forces came under near daily attack throughout July to August 2013. In 2013, the new authorities adopted a more aggressive strategy, leading to mass arrests and hard security measures. Over the few months leading to 2014, the Egyptian army gained the upper hand in the battle against militias that have found safe haven in the peninsula. After isolating and largely clearing the populated northeastern Sinai, the army put many militant factions on the defensive, most notably Ansar Bait al-Maqdis. However, one thousand armed militiamen are still sheltering in the main stronghold in Jabal Halal, as well as Jabal Amer area. In November 2014, the situation in the Sinai was thrust into the spotlight with deadliest attack on the security forces since 2011, and the group responsible Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province. In the wake of the attack on the security forces, the government declared state of emergency, imposing a curfew and establish a buffer zone in the Sinai's border area with Gaza.  May  =May 2013 hostage crisis= On May 2013, a number of Egyptian Army police officers were taken hostage by armed tribesmen in the Sinai peninsula, with their videos released on the internet begging for their lives. As a response, Egypt's government had built up security forces in northern Sinai as part of an effort to secure the release of six policemen and a border guard kidnapped by suspected militants. On 20‚Äì21 May, Egyptian troops and police, backed by helicopter gunships, conducted a sweep through a number of villages in northern Sinai, along the border with Israel. The officials said the forces came under fire from gunmen in vehicles, triggering the clashes. The clashes left one gunman dead by 21 May. The hostages were released on 22 May after talks between the captors and Bedouins. One suspect in the kidnapping was arrested on 30 May 2013.  July  =July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting= Since President Mohamed Morsi's ouster on 3 July by Sisi, there has been an increase in violence by armed Bedouin and Islamists. Attacks on security forces have been witnessed almost daily since his ouster ‚Äî leading many to link the militants there to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Morsi hails. In response, Egypt launched a major military operation in Sinai against the militants, bringing in two additional battalions. In the two weeks following 3 July 39 terrorist attacks occurred in North Sinai. In the resulting clashes between armed groups and security forces, 52 gunmen and civilians and six security personnel died. On 15 July, witnessed the highest civilian casualties, when a bus transporting workers to the army-operated Al- Arish Cement Company was attacked. Five were killed and 15 were wounded. On 16 July, attacks resulted in some of the most intense army engagement, concentrated at Al-Masa'id, Al-Joura, and the Central Security camp at Al- Ahrash. Security operations have been largely confined to the 40-kilometre area between Al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, extending northward toward Rafah along the border with Israel and up to the Karam Abu Salem crossing. Fighting intensifies between the gunmen and the joint army-police forces at night. The frequency of attacks has varied from two to five in a single day. In addition, targets have expanded from fixed security checkpoints to mobile patrols. In most operations, the gunmen use four-wheel drive vehicles and combinations of light and heavy weaponry. However, in three recent attacks RPG-7 launchers were used, most likely smuggled from Libya. The G-7 grenade is capable of penetrating armoured vehicles and is generally fired at the doors. On 27 July, operation dubbed \\"Desert Storm\\" was launched by the Egyptian army in North Sinai Governorate and will last for 48 hours. Two of Egypt's field armies, as well as the country's Air Force and Navy are reportedly taking part in this large-scale operation. The military are said to be blocking all the roads, bridges and tunnels leading from Northern Sinai to other provinces of Egypt. A bomb was placed at a hotel frequented by security officials on 2 August 2013, though it caused no injuries. A security source told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that a majority of \\"terrorists\\" had been arrested as of 3 August 2013. 2 mausoleums were bombed on 4 August 2013, though no injuries resulted. Twenty-five Egyptian policemen died in an attack in the northern region of Sinai, on 18 August. After militants forced two mini-buses carrying off-duty policemen to stop, ordered the policemen out and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them. The Egyptian military arrested eleven people, including five Hamas members, three local residents and three foreign nationals, for their alleged involvement in the killings. The person who committed the murders confessed on 1 September 2013. Military spokesperson Ahmed Ali said that Egyptian security forces recent operations in Sinai, from 5 July to 23 August, resulted in: 78 suspected militants killed, including 32 foreigners; 116 people injured; and 203 people arrested, including 48 foreigners, for their alleged involvement in attacks on security checkpoints in the peninsula. Additionally 343 tunnels on the border between Egypt and Gaza at Rafah have been destroyed.  September  On 3 September, fifteen Islamist militants were killed in an attack by military helicopters. On 7 September, the Egyptian army launched a new operation in the region. The operation involved tanks and at least six Apache helicopters. The army have been jamming communications to thwart militant coordination. The army combed through areas near the Gaza Strip, including locations used by militants suspect in the killing and abduction of Egyptian soldiers over the past year. In the three days of operations, since 7 September, one officer, two soldiers and 29 militants were killed, and 39 militants were arrested. On 11 September, suicide bomber targeted Egyptian military intelligence headquarters in Rafah, bringing down the structure, at the same time a car bomb had rammed an army checkpoint. In the simultaneous attack at least nine soldiers were killed.  December  On 24 December 16 were killed and over 134 injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura, in the worst attack on a government site since the ouster of Morsi in July. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group deemed Egyptian troops infidels because they answer to a \\"secular government\\", warning them to desert or face death.  January  2014 helicopter downing On 26 January, militants shot down an army Mi-17 helicopter in North Sinai, killing all five of its crew members. The weapon the insurgents used was an infrared-homing, surface-to-air missile from the Russian-made Igla family. This was the first time in Egyptian history that an armed nonstate actor dropped a state's military helicopter by a missile. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for this attack as well as series of escalating attacks on police and soldiers. Earlier that morning masked men in an SUV attacked a bus carrying soldiers in Sinai, killing at least three and injuring at least 11.  February  On 3 February, in what was described as the biggest operation in the Egyptian army's ongoing offensive against militants in the Sinai, 30 suspected militants were killed and another 15 injured in a series of airstrikes and another 16 were arrested. =2014 Taba bus bombing= On 16 February 2014, a bomb exploded on or under a tour bus of a South Korean church group in the Egyptian city of Taba, which borders the Gulf of Aqaba and Eilat, Israel. The bombing killed 4 people ‚Äì 3 South Koreans and the Egyptian bus driver ‚Äì and injured 17 others. According to The New York Times, the bombing could \\"offer worrying new evidence that militants who have been attacking Egypt's security forces for months were broadening their campaign against civilians.\\"  October  =October 2014 Sinai attacks= On 24 October 2014, 33 army and police soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in North Sinai.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt- sinai/attacks-in-egypts-sinai-kill-33-security-personnel-idUSKCN0ID1BZ20141024 The attack was the largest ever since the start of the war on terror in Sinai. As a result of the attack, president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared a state of emergency in the governorate after meeting with the National Defence Council for several hours. The state of emergency was to last for three months and to include a daily curfew from 5pm to 7am until further notice.  November  On 10 November 2014, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province group with a confusingly similar name to two Egyptian regional governments. On 14 November 2014, ISIL published a video online that included footage of the group carrying out the October 2014 Sinai attacks. =2015= During 2015, the intensity and the scale of insurgent attacks expanded. January On 12 January 2015, Sinai Province kidnapped a police officer while traveling in North Sinai and took him to an unknown location.

He also said that during the operation 10 militants were killed, while two others were arrested. On 26 January 2015, Sinai Province published a video online that included the kidnapping and execution of the police officer kidnapped on 12 January. =January 2015 Sinai attacks= On 29 January 2015, militants from the Sinai Province militant group launched a series of attacks on army and police bases in Arish using car bombs and mortars. The attacks, which occurred in more than six different locations, resulted in 44 confirmed deaths including army personnel and civilians. http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/10333/17/Security-imperatives-in-Sinai.aspx Security response It was reported that on 6 February 2015 Egyptian security forces attacked the Sinai Province group, killing 47 Islamic militants in Northern Sinai.

Militant group Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed responsibility for the attacks. On 27 April 2015, members from Al-Tarabin tribe in North Sinai launched an attack on Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis positions in Rafah. The attack came after Ansar Bayt al- Maqdis gunmen fatally shot a member of Al-Tarabin tribe in Berth village in southern Rafah, North Sinai, after he refused to take their warning statements ordering them not to deal with the Egyptian military.

August On 1 August 2015, Egyptian army forces surrounded the home of a leading figure of the Sinai- based militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, in the town of Sheikh Zuweid, before shooting him dead.  September  On 3 September 2015, four American and two Fijian Multinational Force and Observers troops were wounded in an attack involving two IEDs. =Operation Martyr's Right= On 8 September 2015, the Egyptian military launched a major operation code-named \\"The Martyr's Right\\". The operation is the largest and most comprehensive operation aimed at rooting out and killing terrorists since July's immediate response to militant attacks. The operation targeted sites in Rafah, Arish, and Sheikh Zuweid, all towns in the northern areas of the peninsula. 535 militants were killed in September 2015. On 13 September 2015, a Fijian soldier attached to the Multinational Force and Observers was wounded by small arms fire.  October  =Downing of Russian passenger plane= Flowers and children's toys at the Pulkovo Airport entrance. The sign at the back says \\"To the victims of A321 plane crash\\". On 31 October 2015, a Russian passenger jet disintegrated above the northern Sinai, killing all 224 aboard. The Islamic State's Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the incident. Russian, Egyptian, and western investigators concluded that the plane was brought down by a bomb planted at Sharm Al Sheikh Airport. It was the deadliest air disaster both in the history of Russian aviation and within Egyptian territory at the time.  December  On 8 December, a bomb in Rafah killed four soldiers and injured four others. =2016= Insurgent attacks increased in early 2016, nearly doubling between the last quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. However, according to The Times of Israel, the numbers of attacks and casualties was declining by August 2016.  March  On 19 March, an attack on a checkpoint in Arish killed 13 policemen.  April  Another attack on 7 April killed 15 soldiers and two civilians.  May  In May, Egyptian security forces launched an air attack on Jabal Halal, a region with an extensive cave system that was a major insurgent stronghold. According to the Egyptian military, 88 militants were killed and many supply caches were destroyed.  June  On 28 June, A series of air strikes killed 30 ISIS fighters and injured 50 others.  August  Then, on 4 August, the army claimed to have killed the leader of Sinai Province, Abu Duaa al-Ansari. Independent sources were unable to verify this claim, or even the existence of al-Ansari. Previous reports had described Abu Osama al-Masri as the leader.  September  The army reported another 40 militants killed by airstrikes in September.  October  On 14 October a total 12 soldiers and 15 militants were killed. On 17 October several clashes in North Sinai left 3 soldiers and 18 insurgents dead. On 30 October a military operation in North Sinai left 4 soldiers and 6 insurgents dead.  November  On 5 November Egyptian soldiers killed at least 11 terrorist. On 10 November army soldiers killed at least 6 insurgents. =2017=  January  On 9 January 2017, an attack by several gunmen and a truck bomb on a police checkpoint in El-Arish causing at least 13 deaths and 22 injuries, according to official sources. One of the attackers, drove a stolen rubbish truck loaded with explosive at the security checkpoint, as gunmen opened fire on police forces.  April  = Palm Sunday church bombings = On February 2017, ISIS produced a video calling for attacks against Christians. In April, ISIS attacked several churches in Egypt Known as Palm Sunday church bombings. The attacks killed over 40 people.  July  In July, a militant raid on an army checkpoint resulted in the deaths of at least 23 soldiers. The checkpoint was looted for weapons and ammunition before the attackers fled the scene. Later that month an attack targeting police killed 5 officers and wounded 11 in the city of el-Arish. A later roadside bomb south of the city wounded a further 6 officers. The attacks came the same day officials claimed the Egyptian Air Force had killed at least 30 militants in strikes on a gathering.  September  In September officers were again attacked in el-Arish, with 18 killed and 7 wounded in an assault involving roadside bombs and small arms fire.  November  = Sinai mosque attack = On 24 November 2017, the Sufi al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed, North Sinai Governorate, Egypt was attacked by around forty gunmen during Friday prayers. The gun and bomb attack killed at least 235 people and injured more than 120, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Egyptian history and the second deadliest attack in 2017, after the 14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings. Other reports of the attack assert that over 300 deaths occurred.Najjar, Farah. (25 March 2018). \\"Sinai Peninsula: Sisi's offensive continues despite promises.\\" Al Jazeera English website Retrieved 25 March 2018.  December  On 19 December 2017 El Arish International Airport was attacked in an attempt to assassinate the Minister of Interior Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar and the minister of defense Sedki Sobhy. The assassination attempt failed and one officer was killed and two were injured. ISIS used kornet anti-tank missile in the attack. Next day a new clash started near the airport where 5 ISIS militants were killed and an army captain was killed. =2018= On 9 February 2018, Col. Tamer el-Refai, the military's spokesman, announced in a statement on state-run television, titled \\"Communique 1 from the General Command of the Armed Forces\\", the launching of Comprehensive Operation ‚Äì Sinai 2018. On 8 October 2018, Egyptian military declared in an operation they have killed 52 Islamist militants. Three Egyptian soldiers were also killed. =2019= In May 2019, Human Rights Watch reported that throughout the operations in Sinai the \\"Egyptian military and police have carried out systematic and widespread arbitrary arrests‚Äîincluding of children‚Äîenforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings, collective punishment, and forced evictions\\", based on interviews with dozens of Sinai residents. In November 2019, Egyptian forces killed 83 suspected fighters in operations in central and North Sinai. =2020= From 2018 to 2020, 840 militants were killed by Egyptian Security Forces who lost 67 soldiers in return. In March 2020, Egyptian forces managed to kill Abu Fares Al-Ansari, a commander of Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, in Al Ajra' area south of Rafah. On 1 May 2020, ISIL claimed responsibility via its Amaq News Agency for a bombing that killed and wounded several Egyptian Army personnel near the city of Bir al-Abd in North Sinai Governorate. In retaliation, Egyptian police managed to kill 18 extremist militants in a raid in northern Sinai Peninsula. On 21 July 2020 ISIS captured four villages in Sinai west of Bir al-Abd. Egyptian army announced recaptured of all villages on 31 August, however ISIS claimed to have repelled the attack. Areas of insurgency According to Reuters, as of 2013, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis was in control of about a third of the villages in Sinai. Now, daily clashes with militants in North Sinai are reported by the army. The insurgency has not spread to south Sinai, where there are tourist hubs. In the northeastern part of the peninsula, checkpoints have often been established by militants as the army lack the power to stop them. The militants have captured and assassinated policemen there. =Outside of Sinai= On 24 December 2013, sixteen people were killed and over a hundred people injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for the attack. On 5 August 2014, 5 policemen were killed in an attack on a police car on Matrouh road by armed militants. On 28 November 2014, the militant group Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the killing of 2 army personnel in Cairo and Qaliubiya. On 1 December 2014, Sinai Province claimed responsibility for killing a United States citizen in Egypt's western desert in August 2014. On 21 December 2014, the Egyptian police raided an Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis cell in the Nile Delta killing 5 members. On 26 December 2014, two Ansar Bait al- Maqdis militants were killed in a gunfight in El-Salam City, on the eastern outskirts of Cairo. The Ministry of Interior later identified one of the dead militants as the commander of Ansar Beit El-Maqdis in the Nile Delta. On 11 July 2015, a car-bomb exploded near the Italian consulate in Cairo, killing one person and injuring nine others. None of the Italian staff of the consulate were injured as the establishment was still closed at the time of the explosion. Later, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack. In the Gaza Strip Out of the approximately 15 main militant groups operating in the Sinai desert, the most dominant and active militant groups have close relations with the Gaza Strip. The Army of Islam, a U.S. designated terrorist organization based in the Gaza Strip, is responsible for training and supplying many militant organizations and jihadist members in Sinai. Mohammed Dormosh, the Army of Islam's leader, is known for his close relationships to the Hamas leadership. The Army of Islam smuggles members into the Gaza Strip for training, then returns them to the Sinai Peninsula to engage in terrorist and jihadist activities. Egyptian response =Military tactics= The disposition of Egyptian forces in the Sinai peninsula is mandated by the Camp David Accords and monitored by the 1,600 foreign troops that make up the Multinational Force and Observers. Egypt is permitted only enough military forces in the Sinai to enforce security. In 2011, Egypt sent an additional 2,500 troops and 250 armored personnel, with helicopters as part of Operation Eagle, a mission to provide security during the power transition from then-recently fallen Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Operation Eagle was joined by Operation Sinai in 2012, which came in response to a militant attack against an Egyptian border post 5 August that killed 16 border guards. Together, the two operations increased the total troop count by more than 2,500 added 80 vehicles and at least two attack helicopters. Egypt also was allowed to deploy armed fighter jets to El Arish to assist its ground forces in Sinai. Egypt's expanded force structure in Sinai is designed to deny militants sanctuary by bringing more force to bear than the municipal police alone can provide. Many of the new forces are stationed in the northeast of Sinai along the Egyptian border with Gaza. Setting up roadblocks and checkpoints to monitor and inspect traffic transiting the Sinai Peninsula to counter this smuggling. In the October 2014 attacks, for the first time the militants in Sinai used suicide truck bombs to breach army roadblocks and strongpoints, then followed them with an infantry attack. After the October attacks, the Egyptian military began using armed drones for the first time since the Sinai insurgency began. And as a measure to counter weapon and militant trafficking between Egypt and Gaza strip, the Egyptian government announced the creation of a buffer zone along the Egypt-Gaza border. Following the attacks on army and police bases in Arish in early 2015, the Egyptian President issued a decree to create a unified military command for the east of the Suez Canal to combat terrorism. Led by General Osama Roshdy Askar, it was to guide counter-terrorism activities of the Second and Third Armies. On 27 April 2015, Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree ordering the isolation and evacuation of new areas in North Sinai's Rafah city, thus expanding the buffer zone. A shift in the militants strategy appeared in the July 2015 clashes. Zack Gold, Middle East analyst, views the battle as a change in strategy from hit and run tactics toward an ISIL-like 'holding' of territory. As an effort to limit car-bombs attacks, Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree banning 4X4 vehicles in army-operations zones in Sinai. In his first meeting with a Middle East nation since his confirmation as defense secretary, Mark Esper met with Egypt's Minister of Defense Mohammad Zaki and pressed him to use counterinsurgency-style tactics in the effort in the Sinai Peninsula. His Deputy for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said that he spoke to Minister Zaki extensively about their efforts in the Sinai and that it was clear they shared the belief in the importance of a population-centric approach to the counter-terrorism effort, even if it takes longer to be successful. Mulroy said he saw evidence of this during his visit to the Sinai where he spoke to both senior and junior military leaders. The fight in the Sinai forms part of the classified Irregular Warfare Annex to the National Defense Strategy, which calls on the Department of Defense to use foreign internal defense principles, advise and assist tactics, and influence operations. Following the mosque attack in November 2017, President el-Sisi vowed to respond with \\"the utmost force\\" and Egyptian authorities in the days immediately after the attack the Air Force claimed to have the pursued and destroyed of some of the militants' vehicles and weapons stocks. Airstrikes were also conducted in the neighboring mountains. In February 2018, the Egyptian military conducted major air strikes and land assaults against terrorist positions in Sinai. =Judicial response= The Egyptian government has used the death penalty to punish those convicted of committing terrorist acts in Sinai. On 26 December 2017, Egypt hanged 15 men convicted of killing nine soldiers during an attack on a military checkpoint in 2013. Israeli involvement Extensive smuggling and kidnapping of migrants (mostly from African countries), drugs and contraband from Sinai into Israel was commonplace in the past, serving as an important source of income for insurgent groups in the Sinai. The crisis in Egypt resulted in a rise in illicit and insurgent activities across the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael border, prompting Israel to construct the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael barrier, completed in 2013. This had the effect of practically eliminating illegal migrant crossing into Israel and significantly reducing cross-border insurgency and drug smuggling. On 16 October 2017, the Islamic State announced that it had fired rockets at Eshkol region in Israel, in response to 'Jewish aircraft' assisting Egyptian security forces. On 23 May 2018, the Islamic State released a video claiming that Israeli aircraft struck civilian homes in the Sinai and showed Hebrew labels on munitions purportedly found in aftermath of the attack. On 2 February 2018, Lebanese Al Akhbar reported that in the last several months, Israel had struck targets of the Islamic State in Sinai, including Palestinians who after abandoning the group's strongholds in Syria and Iraq, joined the offshoot in Sinai. As a result of the airstrikes, more around 20 militants of the group were killed. As of 3 February 2018, the New York Times wrote that the Israeli Defence Forces had conducted over 100 air strikes in Sinai, which elicited a denial from the Egyptian military. Reactions =Israel= In the two years following 2011, Israel approved two Egyptian military increases in the Sinai Peninsula above levels set in the Camp David Accords, which mandates that the Sinai must remain demilitarized, with only enough forces in Sinai to enforce security. Israel did so because it is not in its interest to have unrest in Sinai, whether political protests or militant violence. However, in late 2012, concern began to be raised as Egypt began deploying more force and tanks without coordination from Israel. On 21 August, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that it is important for Israel to make sure that the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is upheld, and not to remain silent as Egyptian military forces enter the Sinai. Concern was raised by Israeli officials over Egyptian failure to notify Israel about the deployment of tanks in the Sinai, which violates the peace treaty. Lieberman said, \\"We must make sure that every detail is upheld, otherwise we'll find ourselves in a slippery slope as far as the peace treaty is concerned.\\" On the same day, Israeli daily Maariv reported that Israel sent a message to Egypt via the White House, protesting Egypt's ongoing increase in military presence in the Sinai without coordination from Israel, and telling Egypt that it must remove tanks from the Sinai because their presence violates the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979, which states that Sinai Peninsula is to remain demilitarized. The Maariv report was echoed by an article in The New York Times, which stated that Israel was \\"troubled\\" by the entry of Egyptian tanks into the northern Sinai Peninsula without coordination with Israel and had asked Egypt to withdraw them. Partly due to Egypt's military deploying tanks in the Sinai Peninsula, Israel is increasingly worried about what has long been their most critical regional relationship. The lack of coordination around their deployment is seen as potentially undermining a peace treaty that has been a cornerstone of Israel's security for decades according to the New York Times. Israel is also concerned that Egypt may use Operation Eagle to build up its military presence in the Sinai, and leave the tanks and armored carriers in the Sinai while not doing much more than symbolic action to eliminate the terrorist threat. Israel has not issued a formal complaint, and instead prefers to resolve the issue through quiet contacts, as well as mediation from the U.S., to avoid straining its relationship with Egypt. On 24 August 2012, a senior Egyptian military source said that Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak have reached an agreement on the issue of the militarization of the Sinai. Al Hayat reported that Sissi phoned Barak and said that Egypt was committed to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel. Sissi also said that the militarization was temporary, and was needed for security and to fight terrorism. However, an Israeli defense official denied that such a conversation took place. In late August 2012, Morsi said that the security operations do not threaten anyone, and \\"there should not be any kind of international or regional concerns at all from the presence of Egyptian security forces\\". Morsi added that the campaign was in \\"full respect to international treaties. The Egyptian-Israeli peace deal places limits on Egyptian military deployment in the Sinai. Officials in Israel were concerned about Egypt building up heavy armour in Sinai.\\" On 8 September 2012, an Israeli official confirmed that coordination exists between Israel and Egypt regarding Operation Eagle. Egyptian Military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali had earlier announced that Egypt has been consulting with Israel regarding its security measures in the Sinai. On 2 July 2015, one day after the attacks on 15 Egyptian Army checkpoints, Israel announced that it was giving Egypt a \\"free hand to operate in northern Sinai against local jihadist groups, voluntarily ignoring an annex to the 1979 Camp David Peace Accords banning the presence of significant Egyptian forces in the area.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to Egypt for the terrorist attacks that rocked that country on 1 July. He further stated that \\"we are together with Egypt and many other states in the Middle East and the world in the struggle against extreme Islamic terrorism.\\" As of 3 February 2018, The New York Times had claimed that Israel has conducted over a 100 Air Strikes in Sinai which has been denied by the Egyptian Military Spokesman Col. Tamer a-Rifai. =United States= According to CNN, in a move to increase security in the Sinai, help Morsi, and reassure Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta offered Egypt classified intelligence-sharing capabilities to help Egypt identify military threats in the area, which he discussed during his recent trips to Egypt and Israel. The technology has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify vehicles at great distances. The technology may also be used by the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The United States is also offering increased intelligence sharing, including satellite imagery and drone flights, as well as cellphone intercepts and other communications among militants suspected of plotting attacks. On 22 August 2012, the State Department urged Egypt to be transparent over Operation Eagle and any security operations in the Sinai. The State Department said that the United States supports Operation Eagle against terrorism, but stressed that Egypt must continue coordination with Israel regarding these operations and military increases in the Sinai, according to the 1979 Camp David Accords. The State Department also called on Egypt to fulfill its obligations under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and deal strongly with security threats in the Sinai, while ensuring that \\"lines of communication stay open.\\" On 23 August 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, urged Amr to maintain lines of communication with Israel, and emphasized the importance of being transparent over the militarization of the Sinai. =Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai= The Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai, a 1,650-strong international organization created in 1979 during the Camp David Accords with peacekeeping responsibilities, kept a low profile during the intensification of Operation Eagle in 2012. A representative for the organization said that \\"we are unable to respond to queries from the media at this time\\" in response to whether Egypt asked permission to move weaponry into the Sinai, and whether Israel granted it. =Jordan= The Egyptian pipeline carrying natural gas to Jordan has been attacked at least 15 times since the start of the uprising in early 2011. The lack of Egyptian gas hit Jordan budget severely (by JOD 1.4 billion or the equivalent of USD 2 billion yearly for the past two years) and they are looking for Egypt to compensate for the lost quantities. =Other= A Mada Masr journalist questioned the accuracy of Interior Ministry reports on at least two accusations. CBS journalist Clarissa Ward went undercover into the Sinai and witnessed evidence of a scorched earth policy.

It is the N,N,N-trimethyl derivative of the well-known biogenic amine tyramine, and, being a natural product with a positively charged nitrogen atom in its molecular structure, it is classed as an alkaloid. Although it is found in a variety of plants, including barley, its properties have not been extensively studied with modern techniques. Candicine is toxic after parenteral administration, producing symptoms of neuromuscular blockade; further details are given in the \\"Pharmacology\\" section below. Occurrence Candicine occurs in a variety of plants, notably the cacti.T. A. Smith (1977). \\"Phenethylamines and related compounds in plants.\\" Phytochemistry 16 9-18. This alkaloid was first isolated from the Argentinian cactus Trichocereus candicans (now reclassified as Echinopsis candicans), from which it derives its name, and from other Trichocereus species. T. candicans may contain up to 5% candicine, and is also a rich source of the closely related alkaloid hordenine.L. Reti (1953). \\"Œ≤-Phenethylamines\\". In The Alkaloids, Vol. III, (R. H. F. Manske and H. L. Holmes, Eds.), pp. 313-338, New York: Academic Press. Candicine also occurs in several plants of genus Citrus. In the late 1950s, Japanese researchers isolated a toxic compound which they named \\"maltoxin\\" from malted barley.N. Urakawa et al. (1959). \\"Some chemical and pharmacological properties of an amine (maltoxin) isolated from malt rootlet.\\" Jap. J. Pharmacol. 9 41-45. After the publication of some papers on its pharmacology (see \\"Pharmacology\\" section), under this name, it was determined that maltoxin was identical to candicine, and the older name has been retained in subsequent articles.N. Urukawa, Y. Hirabe and Y. Okubo (1961). \\"Identification of maltoxin, an active principle from malt rootlet, as candicine.\\" Jap. J. Pharmacol. 11 4-10. Candicine has also been found in the skin of the frog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus pentadactylus, at a concentration of 45 Œºg/g skin, but it is of much more limited occurrence amongst amphibians than its positional isomer, leptodactyline.V. Erspamer, J. M. Cei and M. Roseghini (1963). \\"Occurrence of candicine (p-hydroxy phenylethyltrimethylammonium) in extracts of the skin of Leptodactylus pentadactylus pentadactylus.\\" Life Sci. 3 825-827.M. Roseghini et al. (1986). \\"Indole-, imidazole- and phenyl-alkylamines in the skin of one hundred and forty American amphibian species other than Bufonids.\\" Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C 85 139-147. Chemistry The dominant chemical characteristics of candicine are that it is a quaternary ammonium salt and a phenol. The quaternary ammonium cation is found in association with different anions, forming the corresponding salts, the commonest of which are the iodide and chloride, trivially named \\"candicine iodide\\" (or \\"hordenine methiodide\\") and \\"candicine chloride\\". Since it is impractical to isolate candicine from a natural source along with its original counterion(s), isolation procedures are designed so as to obtain it in association with a particular anion chosen by the investigator. The name \\"candicine\\" when used alone is thus not unequivocally chemically defined. The presence of the phenolic group would make aqueous solutions of candicine salts weakly acidic, but no pKa seems to have been recorded. This phenolic group has been converted to the methyl ether by treatment of candicine with methyl iodide, to make O-methyl candicine iodide.K. W. Rosenmund (1910). \\"Die Synthese des Hordenins, eines Alkaloids aus Gerstenkeimen, und √ºber (Œ±)-p-Oxyphenyl√§thylamin.\\" Chem. Ber. 43 306-313. =Synthesis= One of the earliest syntheses of candicine is that of Barger, who made candicine iodide by the N-methylation of hordenine, using methyl iodide.G. Barger (1909). \\"Synthesis of hordenine, the alkaloid from barley.\\" J. Chem. Soc., Trans. 95 2193-2197. This method has become a standard one for the conversion of tertiary amines to quaternary salts. It was used again by Buck and co-workers, who also reported the conversion of candicine iodide to candicine chloride by treatment with AgCl.J. S. Buck, R. Baltzly and W. S. Ide (1938). \\"Œ≤-Phenethylamine derivatives. Tertiary and quaternary salts.\\" 60 1789-1792. Pharmacology The earliest pharmacological studies on candicine (under the name of hordenine methiodide) appear to be those of Barger and Dale, who studied its effects primarily in cats and isolated animal organ preparations. These researchers found candicine to closely resemble nicotine in its effects. For example, contractions of isolated sections of rabbit jejunum were produced by ~ 2 √ó 10‚àí5M concentrations of the drug; 1 mg of candicine iodide given i.v. to cats produced the same rise in blood pressure as 0.5 mg nicotine; toxic doses produced respiratory paralysis. It was observed that in the same blood pressure assay, candicine iodide was about twice as potent as its structural analog tyramine, and much more potent than its even-closer analog, hordenine.G. Barger and H. H. Dale (1910). \\"Chemical structure and sympathomimetic action of amines.\\" J. Physiol. 41 19‚Äì59. After Reti's discovery (and naming) of candicine as a natural product,L. Reti (1933) Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol. 114 811. a series of pharmacological investigations was carried out on this alkaloid by Luduena. These are summarized in Reti's review: as before, the similarity of effects between candicine and nicotine was noted. In Luduena's experiments, candicine first stimulated, then blocked ganglionic transmission; its effects were not altered by yohimbine, cocaine, or atropine, but completely counteracted by sparteine or tetrapropylammonium iodide. No muscarinic action was seen. Doses of 6 mg/kg were curare-like in the dog; similar effects were also observed in the toad, Bufo arenarum. CandicineReferred to as \\"maltoxin\\" - see \\"Occurrence\\" section for explanation. (as either the iodide or chloride) was re-investigated by Japanese pharmacologists in the early 1960s. Initial experiments on frogs, using rectus muscle and nerve-sartorius preparations from Rana nigromaculata nigromaculata, showed that the alkaloid caused contractions in the rectus at concentrations of 0.01‚Äì0.2 mg/mL, and blocked the response of the nerve-sartorius to direct or indirect electrical stimulation at similar concentrations. The contraction of the rectus was inhibited by pre-treatment with tubocurarine, as was the response of the nerve-sartorius (i.e., the normal muscle twitch was not reduced by the application of candicine subsequent to tubocurarine). The action of candicine in these assays was not affected by eserine. Taking additional observations into account, these researchers concluded that the effects on frog tissue of candicine most closely resembled those of the well- known depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drug decamethonium.N. Urakawa, T. Deguchi and Y. Ohkubo (1960). \\"Decamethonium-like action of maltoxin, an active principle from malt rootlet, on the frog muscle.\\" Jap. J. Pharmacol. 10 1-6. An earlier comparison of 0.2 mg of candicine chloride with 2 mg of hordenine sulfate on the rectus muscle preparation showed that hordenine was much less potent at eliciting a contraction, even at 10√ó the concentration of candicine. Following their experiments on frogs, the Japanese group carried out a series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6 mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1 mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06‚Äì0.12 mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time- dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012 mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre- treatment. Concentrations of 3-6 Œºg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).T. Deguchi et al. (1963). \\"Ganglion stimulating action of candicine.\\" Jap. J.

She is best known for her Marsh and Daughter mystery series, featuring a writing team consisting of a wheel-chair bound ex-policeman and his daughter, and for another series featuring a Victorian era chef, Auguste Didier. Myers' books have been favourably reviewed in Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, Booklist, and Kirkus Reviews. Myers has also been published several times in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Janet Hutchings, the magazine's longtime editor, called Myers \\"one of our best and most frequent contributors of historicals\\" (i.e., historical mysteries).  Personal life  Myers was born in Barnehurst, which was still considered part of Kent in 1938. (In 1965, the town became part of Greater London.) It was while working in publishing that Myers met her soon- to-be American husband. Myers oversaw the publication of an autobiography by English bullfighter Henry Higgins; she met Higgins, his co-author, and the co- author's cousin, James Myers, born in Buffalo, New York. Although American- born, James Myers, has spent his adult life living in Europe. For 10 years, the Myers maintained a commuter marriage, dividing their time between Paris, where James worked, and London, where Amy worked. It was during her stays in Paris that Myers dreamed up the character for her first mystery series, Auguste Didier, a half-English, half French chef who reluctantly dabbled in detection during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. The couple now live in Kent full-time.  Writing career  Like the character Luke Frost in Myers' Marsh and Daughter series, Myers was once a publisher. She served as director of the now-defunct publishing firm of William Kimber & Co. Ltd., which specialised in war and theatrical memoirs, autobiographies, biographies, and tales of hauntings. Myers published her first mystery, Murder in Pug's Parlor, in 1986. In 1988, Myers turned to writing full-time. After 11 Auguste Didier mysteries, Myers introduced former police detective Peter Marsh and his daughter Georgia in The Wickenham Murders in 2004. The father‚Äìdaughter team write true-crime novels in which they expose an injustice or sleuth out the answer to an unsolved crime from the distant past. The Marshes' investigations almost inevitably involve them with present-day murders stemming from secrets involving the past. Myers launched a third series in 2007 with Tom Wasp and the Murdered Stunner. Tom Wasp, a Victorian era chimney sweep in East London, solves crimes along with his former apprentice, Ned. Myers' fourth series, written with the help of her car buff husband, began in 2011 with Classic in the Barn. That series features a modern-day classic-car restorer in Kent, Jack Colby, who helps the police with cases involving classic cars. In 2017, Myers introduced yet another cozy mystery series, this one featuring Nell Drury, a female French-trained chef in 1925 Kent when such a thing was a real anomaly. The debut novel is titled Dancing with Death. For her romances, historical sagas and suspense novels, Myers created the pseudonym Harriet Hudson, although she has occasionally also used the names Laura Daniels and Alice Carr. Myers also writes reviews of other books at the online crime and thriller magazine Shots. = Mystery novels =  Auguste Didier series  * 1986 Murder in Pug's Parlour * 1986 Murder in the Limelight * 1989 Murder at the Masque * 1991 Murder Makes an Entree * 1992 Murder Under the Kissing Bough * 1994 Murder in the Smokehouse * 1995 Murder at the Music Hall * 1996 Murder in the Motor Stable * 1999 Murder with Majesty * 2000 Murder in the Queen's Boudoir  Marsh and Daughter series  * 2004 The Wickenham Murders * 2005 Murder in Friday Street * 2006 Murder in Hell's Corner * 2007 Murder and the Golden Goblet * 2008 Murder in the Mist * 2009 Murder Takes the Stage * 2010 Murder on the Old Road * 2011 Murder in Abbot's Folly  Tom Wasp series  * 2007 Tom Wasp and the Murdered Stunner * 2010 Tom Wasp and the Newgate Knocker  Classic Car series  * 2011 Classic in the Barn * 2012 Classic in the Clouds * 2012 Classic Calls the Shots * 2013 Classic Mistake * 2014 Classic in the Pits * 2015 Classic Cashes In * 2015 Classic in the Dock * 2016 Classic at Bay  Nell Drury series  * 2017 Dancing with Death = Under the pseudonym Harriet Hudson = * 1989 Look for Me by Moonlight * 1991 When Nightingales Sang * 1992 The Wooing of Katie May * 1993 The Girl from Gadsby's * 1998 Into the Sunlight * 1999 Not in our Stars * 2000 The Sun in Glory * 2000 To My Own Desire * 2001 Quinn * 2002 Tomorrow's Garden * 2003 Catching the Sunlight * 2005 Applemere Summer * 2007 The Windy Hill * 2007 The Stationmaster's Daughter * 2010 The Man Who Came Back  The Ashden Quartet  (set in the English homefront during World War I at the rectory in the Sussex village of Ashden) * 1996 The Last Summer (under the pseudonym Alice Carr) * 1999 Dark Harvest (under the pseudonym Alice Carr) * 1999 Winter Roses (under the pseudonym Harriet Hudson) * 2001 Songs of Spring (under the pseudonym Harriet Hudson) = Under the pseudonym Laura Daniels = * 1995 Pleasant Vices * 1995 The Lakenham Folly = Short story collection = *2006 Murder, 'Orrible Murder!

Laomian is closely related to the Bisu language, is spoken in Laomian Dazhai ËÄÅÁºÖÂ§ßÂØ®, Zhutang Township Á´πÂ°ò‰π°, Lancang County, Yunnan.http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=111478 There are 4,000 speakers (out of 5,000 ethnic members) in central Lancang County, Yunnan (Bradley 2007), and fewer than 1,000 Laopin speakers, which may not be included in these numbers. Its language family consists of Sino- Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman, Ngwi-Burmese, Ngwi, Southern, Bisoid, Bisu-Pyen- Laomian, Bisu, Pyen, and Laomian. It is mostly spoken in China in the Southwestern areas of Yunnan Province that joins Thailand and Myanmar. Speakers of Laomian that live in areas with different ethnic groups mostly speak Laomian in their home, while using the main local ethnic language in public. The average age of Laomian speakers is increasing into the sixties to seventies in areas of heterogeneous communities because children are learning the main local language. The domination of Chinese language has had a major impact on the villages of the Laomian people due to the increasing number of people who can speak multiple languages. Geographic distribution Two centuries ago, the Lahu people started a rebellion in the Shuangjiang, Lancang and Menglian areas of Yunnan Province. The Bisu people, also known as the Laomian and Laopin people, joined them. In 1801 the rebellion was stopped and the Bisu people followed the Nanku River south. They experienced many grades of oppression in various locations and finally arrived at Muga Mengnuo and Zhutand in Lancang. The Bisu people were entangled in an armed uprising of farmers. This was put down by the alliance of the Lahu Tsui, Han landlords and the local warlords. The Bisu people then moved to Menglian, Ximeng and Menghai. Mong Yang township is bordered to the east by Menghai County and to the north by Menglian County ‚Äì both areas where Bisu settled and remain to the present day. =Official status= China is the only country to still have people who still use Laomian. Some of the places located within China that still use this language are: * Yunnan Province ** Lancang County ** Menglian County ** Ximeng County * Menghai County (in Mengzhe Township) =Dialects/Varieties= The languages Lanmeng, Huaipa, Dakao, Laopin are similar to Pyen and Bisu, but have a ninety-three to ninety-five percent lexical similarity to Laomian and Laopin and eighty-eight percent to Bisu in Thailand. =Derived languages= Laopin has been influenced by the Tai Lue people over a long time period, while both Laomian and Laopin have been influenced recently by Chinese. Due to this, there are many loanwords, concepts and new technological terms that are not traditional Bisu terms. These neighboring influences have affected Laomian and Laopin grammar and phonology. Grammar In 2000, Person studied sentence-final particles in Bisu narrative. In his studies, he looked at 13 written folktales, 6 expository texts, and 3 life histories to establish the aspects that influence particle usage. Person examines variables such as, place in the discourse, relative transitivity, sentence complexity, occurrence or nonoccurrence in quotations and evidential perspective. He also studied the effect of text-type on particle usage in Bisu discourse and concluded that Bisu particles vary according to text type. =Syntax= A researcher named Xu Shixuan studied and gave examples of how Bisu syntax had been affected due to the contact that they had with neighbouring languages. The traditional SOV constituent order is occasionally changed to SVO because both Chinese and Dai have SVO order. Also, another researcher, Day, analyzed Bisu noun phrase in Doi Chumphu village, Thailand. She characterized the noun phrase in Bisu, and declared that the word, [ma≈ã], in Bisu is a classifier and that the prefix [a≈ã-] is a nominalizer. Another researcher, Gustafson, contributed a detailed grammar statement for Thailand Bisu. She described complex sentences including nominalization, relativization and complementation, as well as, a more in- depth piece information of verbal particles, pragmatically marked structures and an explanation of the role of the prefixes ang- and a- are provided in her study. Vocabulary In the recent years, the use of Chinese is becoming more popular and is causing a language shift. Many people are using Lahu, Mandarin Chinese, Hani and L√º. Laomian is very threatened to endangerment, notably in the Nanya in Menglian, where it is economically advantaged and the use of Chinese and Lahu are replacing Laomian. More than fifty percent of the Laomian population that is left in China is mixed with Lahu-majority villages and not all of the remaining people can speak Laomian. In Muang Muang Tun's research 48/48 of the people responded that they use Laomian/Laopin while speaking to their parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. These people use Laomian/Laopin the most in their families. Although, 3/36 Laomian people stated that they use Lahu when they speak to their spouses and 3/12 Laopin people use Chinese or Lahu or Dai to communicate with their spouses. 48/48 Laomian/Laopin people stated that they use Laomian/Laopin when they talk to Laomian/Laopin friends at a funeral or village meeting, but 48/48 [100%] said that they use Chinese when they meet government workers. Lastly, 48/48 [100%] said that the Laomain/Laopin children will be speaking Laomian/Laopin in the future. Writing system The writing system that is used is Thai script which is experimental. The Thai script consists of 44 consonant letters and 15 vowel symbols and combine into at least 28 vowel forms, as well as, four tone diacritics. Thai script is a segmental writing system or an abugida. While using this writing system, the consonants are written horizontally from left to right and the vowels are placed either to the left or right, or above or below the consonant that is being used.

The operation came as a direct response to the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack on 5 August 2012. The operation was initially reported as part of \\"Operation Nisr\\" (Operation Eagle), but on 3 September 2012, the Egyptian army issued a statement requesting media sources to use the official name \\"Operation Sinai.\\" Background The Egyptian Armed Forces are engaged in a difficult and sustained military campaign to subdue and eliminate dangerous and violent extremists from the Northern Sinai Peninsula. These extremists pose a dangerous threat to the people of the Sinai, the security of Egypt, and to the stability of the broader Middle East region. The fight against extremism in the Sinai is one of global significance. Over the last two years, extremists in the Northern Sinai region have attacked civilians and Egyptian authorities, resulting in military and police deaths, and countless other injuries. The Sinai insurgency began in February 2011, during the events of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. As a result of destabilization of the Egyptian government, various insurgent groups, including mostly Bedouins, began to undermine central authority of Egypt. As a result, Egyptian interim government poured troops into the Sinai peninsula on 15 August 2011, in what became known as Operation Eagle. During the Mohamed Morsi's presidency, attempted to relaxed restrictions and conduct a \\"political dialogue\\" with salafi jihadist groups. Despite these efforts, however, fighting in the Sinai continued.Security in the Sinai: Present and Future , Zack Gold, ICCT Research Paper March 2014 The 2012 Egyptian‚ÄìIsraeli border attack, which led to Operation Sinai, occurred on 5 August 2012, when armed men ambushed an Egyptian military base in the Sinai Peninsula, killing 16 soldiers and stealing two armored cars, which they used to infiltrate into Israel. The attackers broke through the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Israel, where one of the vehicles exploded. They then engaged in firefight with soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, during which six of the attackers were killed. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi vowed to retake the Sinai Peninsula and declared three days of mourning. August 2012 A few days after the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack, forces from Egypt‚Äôs army and the police engaged in an operation against armed men who have been targeting security personnel in North Sinai. A number of clashes between armed men and security forces at several security checkpoints in the Sinai occurred during this time. In one attack, gunmen opened fire on three local security checkpoints, wounding at least six people, and triggering protests in the region by Egyptians, who demanded protection. At 3:20 A.M., on 8 August, following attacks on several of these security checkpoints, Egyptian military troops and jets killed 20 militants, wounded a few dozen people, and destroyed three armored cars belongs to the militants in the village of al-Toumah in the Sinai Peninsula. This was the first time since 1973 that Egypt launched an air strike in the Sinai. A commander said that the army had received information that many fighters were in the village. Separate attacks by the military were also carried out just outside Sheikh Zuwayed. Egyptian security sources said that over 2,000 Islamic militants reside in the Sinai region, and the Egyptian media are referring to the operation as \\"Sinai cleansing operation.\\" The military said that the goal of the operation is to \\"restore security by pursuing and targeting armed terrorist elements in Sinai.\\" Security sources in Sheikh Zuwayed, a city in the Sinai, reported that the Egyptian army has been raiding hundreds of houses in the region in the hopes of tracing terrorists and confiscating weapons. Later in the day, Egypt‚Äôs military said that its operation against fighters in the Sinai Peninsula was \\"a complete success and will continue.\\" On 9 August, Israel's security cabinet approved a request from Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak to allow Egypt to deploy attack helicopters in the Sinai Peninsula for its recent operations. This approval was necessary under the Camp David Accords, which limit the type of weaponry that are allowed in the Sinai. On 10 August, the police and military arrested nine suspects (of the 5 August attack) in the village of Sheikh Zuwayed, in North Sinai, as part of the ongoing operation. A military source called the arrested suspects \\"terrorist elements\\" and another high-level military source said that the suspects belong to radical groups. One of those arrested was nicknamed by Egypt as \\"Bin Laden of Sinai\\" and is suspected of being responsible for planning and executing the 5 August attack. Another accomplice possessed 22 Egyptian citizens‚Äô ID cards. The arrested were charged with attacking police officers and stations in the Sinai Peninsula, belonging to a jihadi group, and smuggling weapons to and from the Gaza Strip. On 10 August, NPR's Leila Fadel said that she could not find any evidence of the new Egyptian military campaign, when she went to villages where the fighting was said to have been the most intense, which has raised the possibility that Egypt has been inflating the facts on their military campaign. As of 11 August, Egypt sent hundreds of troops and armored vehicles into North Sinai to combat terrorists operating near the Egyptian-Israeli border. Al Ahram reported that security forces have intensified their presence in a number of villages in North Sinai where wanted suspects are believed to be hiding. One of these villages, the Mahdeya village, is considered to be the largest arms trade center in North Sinai, and security forces aim to eliminiate similar spots because they provide sophisticated weapons to radical groups. On the same day, a group of armed men opened fire on peacekeeping troops in the Um Shyhan area in the Sinai on the border with Israel. No one was injured. On 12 August, Egyptian security forces killed seven suspected militants during raids on hideouts in two villages near El-Arish of al-Ghora and al-Mahdiyah in northern Sinai. The security officials seized landmines, an anti-aircraft missile, heavy machine-guns and grenades. The militants were killed when the security forces shelled a house in which they took cover after exchanging fire. On 13 August, the sixth day of the military crackdown on Islamists, armed men shot dead tribal leader Khalaf Al-Menahy and his son, as they came back from a conference organized by tribal leaders to denounce militancy. In addition, a source close to Islamists in the Sinai said that hundreds of them had organized a secret meeting to discuss their response to the killing of five suspected terrorists by Egyptian soldiers earlier in the day, and agreed that the reaction will be harsh. On 17 August, an arrested suspect guided security forces to an apartment in Sheikh Zuwayed that was used by terrorists to hide \\"wireless devices and jihadist books.\\" The apartment also contained three black flags that read. \\"There is no god but God and Mohamed is the messenger of God.\\" On 20 August, Defense Minister General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made his first visit to the Sinai since the 5 August attack, and finalized plans to intensify the crackdown. These plans included using aircraft and tanks in the Sinai for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. September 2012 On 7 September 2012, gunmen attacked the Egyptian Rayesa checkpoint, located outside of Arish in the Sinai. This marked the 34th attack on the checkpoint since the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Egyptian soldiers searched the surrounding area and inspected passing cars to question their passengers. On 8 September 2012, Egyptian military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali announced that Egyptian soldiers have killed 32 \\"criminal elements,\\" arrested 38 people, and destroyed 31 smuggling tunnels along the Egyptian-Gaza border as part of Operation Sinai, following the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack. In addition, Ali said that Egypt was consulting Israel regarding Egyptian security measures in the Sinai, which an Israeli government official confirmed. Israeli soldiers, who were providing security to construction crews building a fence in the Har Harif area on the border with the Egyptian Sinai, were attacked. One Israeli soldier was killed and another was wounded during the attack, while three gunmen executing the attack were killed by the Israeli military. A group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem (\\"Supporters of Jerusalem\\") claimed responsibility for the deadly attack along the Egyptian-Israeli border. October 2012 By October 2012, a large amount of Egyptian forces had been withdrawn from Sinai. On 8 October 2012, there was an alleged attack on Egyptian Central Security Forces with 21 people dying in a truck crash. The attack was initially referred to as an accident. However, sources have stated that gunmen shot at the vehicles' tires, causing it to lose control and crash. A more recent statement by the police has placed the blame of the crash on driver error. Egyptian Armed Forces' strategy and operations Egyptian security forces launched Operation Sinai (Op-Sinai) to reassert effective control of the area by subduing and eliminating violent extremists. The campaign is a comprehensive and sustained effort involving air, land, special forces, and intelligence units of the Egyptian military. _The key military objectives of the Egyptian military‚Äôs Sinai operations include:_ * Protect the Suez Canal. * Eliminate violent extremists. * Enhance border security and prevent smuggling. * Protect Egyptian citizens and enable a better quality of life. _The Egyptian Armed Forces are carrying out tasks in Sinai according to certain considerations, limitations, and controls:_ * The first consideration: The implementation of mission objectives with the highest degree of success and the fewest casualties. * The second consideration: Limiting the confrontations to armed elements that are threatening security, while maintaining a close dialogue with local people. * The third consideration: Deploying a diverse array of troops and armament systems to deal with the unique topographic nature of Sinai, which carries a variety of attributes like farmlands, deserts, mountains and residential cities. * The fourth consideration: Care and respect for the local population and their customs, traditions, and values. Mutual respect and cooperation forms the basis of the close relationship between the Egyptian Armed Forces and people in Sinai. This relationship is considered one of the national action pillars ‚Äì to achieve national interests without affecting the rights, freedoms, and interests of people in Sinai. * The fifth consideration: The strict adherence to mission objectives and goals, which will ensures the successful completion of this military operation. * The sixth consideration: Bringing about security and stability in the Sinai, as part of an integrated plan to revive growth and development in the region, and deal with all the influencing sources on the security in Sinai from different directions. Key Facts Units of the Egyptian Second Army, along with Naval and Air Forces, are working closely with local police, government and Bedouin leaders to prevent acts of terrorism in the North Sinai by identifying and eliminating violent extremists in villages. The military has also launched operations to close illegal tunnels that enable smuggling of illicit materials underneath the Egypt-Gaza border. Naval vessels patrol the Suez to ensure safe passage of ships, and prevent terrorist attacks from shore, and Egyptian forces are working to protect critically important gas pipelines and prevent future terrorist attacks on them. _Force Deployment:_ * The Op-Sinai mission is being conducted as a joint command, coordinated by the Egyptian Second Field Army. The mission includes other key elements of the Egyptian military, including the Air Force, Navy, Border Guard, and Special Forces. * The Second Field Army is coordinating its operations with the Governorate of the North Sinai, local Bedouin tribal leaders, the civil police and other local officials.

It was used in former times (about 1750 to 1918) by barges to bring peat from the Teufelsmoor area to the town of Bremen. In the area of Teufelsmoor the peat was dug and dried, and in Bremen it was used for heating purposes. The Neue Semkenfahrt canal in Blockland in Bremen, Germany (photo Till F. Teenck) Semkenfahrt denotes three parts of the canal system: the Alte Semkenfahrt (= Old Semkenfahrt), the Semkenfahrtkanal (= Semkenfahrt canal), and the Neue Semkenfahrt (= New Semkenfahrt). The word Semkenfahrt originated from Semken, the surname of a family who gave the land to build the canal, and Fahrt which means a navigable channel in the nautical sense.  History of the Semkenfahrt  With a barge carrying peat from Worpswede bound for Bremen, a skipper had to use the rivers Hamme, Lesum and W√ºmme. The journey took about three to four days. In the year 1754 a project was started to connect the newly founded village of T√ºschendorf with the river Hamme. The canal, called Alte Semkenfahrt, had to make an arc to pass the hill of Weyerberg, then joining the river Hamme. While the peat barges were in the Semkenfahrt they had to be hauled. On reaching the river Hamme, if the wind came from an easterly direction, the skipper could use sail. But in North Germany the wind comes mostly from the west, so for the most part the skipper could set the sails only on the way back, when the barges were empty. On the way to Bremen they mostly had to punt or to scull. The peat barge traffic reached its peak at the end of the 19th century. For example, in the year 1880, 25,000 shiploads reached Bremen. About 5,000 to 6,000 of these shiploads used the Semkenfahrt. The cargo was in total approximately 30,000 to 36,000 cubic meters in volume.  Alte Semkenfahrt - Old Semkenfahrt  (Start: ; End: ) In 1754 the Alte Semkenfahrt was dug, beginning at the village of T√ºschendorf, and passing the villages of Adolphsdorf, Otterstein, Mooringen, Worpheim, and Waakhausen, and then joining the river Hamme. Today only the part from Waakhausen to the Hamme can be used by canoes. The remaining parts are now too small for canoes. Today the Semkenfahrt between Waakhausen and the river Hamme looks like this.  Semkenfahrtkanal - Semkenfahrt canal  (Start: ; End: ) This part of the Semkenfahrt was established in 1888. It starts at the \\"Alte Semkenfahrt\\" in Worpheim and leads directly to the river W√ºmme. It reaches the W√ºmme at the inn \\"Zur Schleuse\\" in the village of Truperdeich. \\"Zur Schleuse\\" means a lock in the nautical sense, and the inn is thus named because it is located close to the lock by which the barges left the Semkenfahrt and came into the river W√ºmme. The lock was necessary because the river W√ºmme has a dike to suppress the influence of the tide. This part of the Semkenfahrt very much shortens the route.  Neue Semkenfahrt - New Semkenfahrt  (Start: ; End: ) This part was established after 1888. At first it was named Neuer Torfkanal. This part starts on the south bank of the river W√ºmme at the Gartelmann's Gasthof inn. The river W√ºmme is protected by a dike. Until 1902 there was no lock available to pass the dike, and the barges had to pass the dike by a slip mechanism, driven by a manually operated winch. After the barges left the Neue Semkenfahrt they came into the Torfkanal and then it was only a short way to the destination, the Torfhafen (harbour for peat). The economic importance of the peat traffic at that time is shown by the length of the quay: 1 km (approximately 0.6 miles).

He returned to Spain in 1803, where he was made initially the Director of Labour, and the Director of the Real F√°brica del Buen Retiro in 1807; here he developed hard-paste porcelain which helped in quality production and financial improvement of the company. With the French invasion in 1808 and eventual destruction of the factory in 1812, Sureda returned to France. He was known to be in Mallorca in 1817 and was involved in manufacturing \\"worsted cloth.\\" He was recalled to Madrid to head the Real Fabrica de Pano in Guadalajara and was also given the charge as acting director of the Real Fabrica de la Moncloa. In 1817, Buen Retiro's successor became the new Royal Porcelain Factory at Moncloa. All the employees of the destroyed factory were reemployed in the new one, and Sureda returned to be its director until 1820. In 1822, he became director of the Real F√°brica de Cristales de La Granja. After his retirement from the royal service on 13 November 1829, he moved back to Mallorca. He was recalled to Bueno Retiro from Paris, on 2 September 1803 and as per records he started working in the factory from October 1803. This establishes the dating of the portrait dated 1803‚Äì1808 of Sureda and his wife; the costume worn for the portrait is of 1799 vintage which also establishes the dates. When he worked in Bueno Retiro, Sureda used for his porcelain works all the materials required in hard-paste porcelain, similar to that used in S√®vres porcelain, except for the kaolin and calcined Scapolite, its substitute; lead was not used by him in his works. He used pure feldspar flux (feldspar obtained from Colmenar de Oreja) for glazing. He drew raw materials from sites close to Madrid, Vallecas‚Äôs scapolite and Galagar's flint. The magnesium paste developed by him, which he used extensively in the manufacture of Bueno Porcelain was considered unique for its chemical composition which permitted firing under varying temperatures. He followed Goya‚Äôs style of painting, and after he retired to Melorca devoted his time to his life‚Äôs ambition of painting of landscapes, religious themes and general scenes. He died on 10 May 1850. His son Alejandro Sureda became a noted architect.

The ensuing investigation resulted in the resignations of five members of President Robert Mugabe's cabinet. One of the five, Maurice Nyagumbo, later committed suicide after being charged with perjury. The reporters who had broken the story, Geoffrey Nyarota and Davison Maruziva, were subsequently removed from their posts.  Discovery  In October 1988, members of parliament Obert Mpofu and Duduzile Manghena accidentally received a cheque from a car company in Willowvale, an industrial area of Harare; the cheque had actually been intended for Alford Mpofu, a friend of Industry Minister Callistus Ndlovu. Obert Mpofu took the cheque to Lancyott Mpofu and Prince Sunduzani, editors of the state-owned Bulawayo Chronicle. The paper had already built a reputation for aggressive investigations into corruption at all levels of government, and began to investigate. In the weeks following their discovery of the cheque, Nyarota and deputy editor Davison Maruziva learned that ministers and officials from the government of President Robert Mugabe had been given early access to buy foreign cars at the Willowvale assembly plant. In some cases, the cars were bought wholesale and resold at a 200% profit. Implicated ministers included Ndlovu, Political Affairs Minister Maurice Nyagumbo, Defense Minister Enos Nkala and Minister of State for Political Affairs, Frederick Shava, who was later elected as President of the UN Economic and Social Affairs Council in 2016. The newspaper published documents from the plant to prove its case, including identification numbers from the vehicles.  Consequences  In December 1988, Mugabe appointed a three-person panel, the Sandura Commission, to investigate the allegations. The Washington Post reported that the commission's hearings \\"struck a deep chord\\" in Zimbabwe, where citizens had grown to resent the perceived growing corruption of government. A provincial governor and five of Mugabe's cabinet ministers eventually resigned due to implication in the scandal, including Shava, Nkala and Nyagumbo, who at the time was the third highest-ranking official in Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Nyagumbo committed suicide by drinking pesticide. However, Nyarota and Maruziva were both forced out of their jobs with the state-owned paper and into newly created public relations positions in Harare. Though the men were given pay raises, Mugabe also stated that the move was a result of their \\"overzealousness\\", leading to public belief that they had been removed for their reporting. ZANU parliamentarians also criticized Nyarota and Maruziva, with the Minister of State for National Security Emmerson Mnangagwa stating that criticism was welcome, but \\"to the extent that the press now deliberately target Government as their enemy, then we part ways.\\"  In music  The scandal featured prominently in the lyrics of Solomon Skuza's album Love and Scandals. In one song, he asks, \\"how can someone buy a car and sell it again?\\" In another, he sings of his love leaving him for \\"a guy who owns a Cressida\\", referring to the Toyota Cressidas assembled at Willowvale.

History James Alexander Holden was born in Walsall (at that time in Staffordshire), the younger son of Edward Holden, saddler and hardware merchant, and his American wife Elizabeth, n√©e Mason. Their elder son was Edward Thomas Holden, later Sir Edward, industrialist and, briefly, Liberal MP for Walsall. James's mother died when he was quite young, and something like enmity developed between him and his father's new wife. Then in 1851 his father died, leaving his business to his second wife and the older son, and James was urged by George Fife Angas to forge a new life in the new colony of South Australia. But first he sailed to America, where he was hospitably received by his mother's sister, then after a few years reached Adelaide, arriving in 1852, just as half the male population of South Australia was trying its luck in the goldfields of the neighbouring colony of Victoria. He found rented accommodation, and employment with chemist F. H. Faulding. In 1853 his cousin Edwin Thomas Smith emigrated to South Australia aboard the California and with help from Holden began importing ironmongery. An extensive and interesting article spoiled by a few typo's. In 1856 he set up in business as J. A. Holden & Co., merchants and wholesale saddlers, selling imported and locally made (no doubt from his brother) saddles, whips and harnesses. His business flourished, and in 1857 he married his landlady's daughter and purchased a four-roomed cottage in Beulah Park. They later moved into a larger home in Magill, then a year later sold up both places for a Kensington Park property of , where in 1871 the original cottage was replaced with a seven roomed residence, with substantial additions in 1875. Holden & Birks in Rundle Street The business also went through a succession of addresses, from the original leased premises at the corner of King William and Rundle Street in 1856 then larger premises at 34 King William Street in 1859. The business, which became J. A. Holden & Co. in 1863, moved to a building in Gawler Place, which he purchased in 1865. A contract to supply carts and other equipment for the Overland Telegraph Line project's 165 horses and 210 bullocks was a major factor in the expansion of the business. From October 1871 to May 1874 Alfred James Birks was a partner in a subsidiary retail business, termed Holden & Birks, owning premises on Rundle Street at the south west corner of Gawler Place. J. A. Holden & Co., 100 Grenfell Street In May 1879 J. A. Holden & Co. moved to a two-storey building in Grenfell Street and brought in his son Henry as partner. He sold the Gawler Place property to D & W Murray and the Rundle Street premises to Birks. Around the same time, saddler H. A. Frost joined the firm. On 1 May 1884 James took Frost into partnership in the business, which was in financial difficulties. In August 1885 J. A. Holden sold to his son H. J. Holden and H. A. Frost his interest in the retail arm of the company, which in November 1885 became Holden & Frost. In 1886 J. A. Holden was declared insolvent. He put the wholesale arm of the business on the open market as well as the Grenfell Street warehouse. He put his Kensington Park house and grounds on the market for urgent sale. Under the terms of the voluntary liquidation, Holden & Frost continued to operate from the premises at 100 Grenfell Street until they were once again solvent, and the building was purchased by Harris, Scarfe & Co. in 1923. J. A. Holden died somewhat less than two years later, of tuberculosis complicated by alcohol abuse. Frost died in 1909, and Henry James Holden purchased Frost's equity in the business from his estate, becoming sole proprietor. Other interests He was one of the founders of the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures and represented South Australia in several trade missions sent to Britain and Europe. He was an active member of the Baptist Church.

When Klobb/Klopp died intestate on August 7, 1787, the property's two land tracts and distillery were sold by the local Orphans' Court to his sons, John, Jacob and Peter Klobb/Klopp. The property and its buildings were then resold in 1815 to John Bechtle, who was forced by financial circumstances to sell the property during a Sheriff's sale in 1824. Purchased by Jacob and Daniel Bechtle at that time, they sold their shares to John Kalbach, respectively, in 1831 and 1839. Kalbach then sold the property to his son, John, in 1843. Following his death two years later, the property was transferred to Joseph Kalbach, who then sold it to Benjamin Lamm in 1846. After working the land for more than two decades, Lamm died in 1869; the farm was then purchased by Amandon Kissling for $13,000. The farm then remained in the Kissling family's hands between that time and the time that the property was nominated for placement on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\\"Engagement Announcement\\" (Anna Bear; mentions Kissling Farm and the Kissling family).

Radial velocity variations had been found in 1906, but only one set of absorption lines could be detected in the spectrum and it was not possible to calculate a reliable orbit until 1976. 1 Geminorum is a triple star system 0.17 degree south of the ecliptic. The primary component of the system, 1 Geminorum A, is a K-type red clump giant star around twice the mass of the Sun. Component A is orbited by a spectroscopic binary pair of stars at a separation of about 9.4 astronomical units every 4877.6 days. The two secondary components, 1 Geminorum Ba and Bb, have not been resolved, but regular periodic Doppler shifts in the spectrum indicate orbital motion of a binary pairing consisting of an F-type subgiant and a solar-mass star that may be G-type, separated by approximately 0.1234 astronomical units.

Translations into English of classic Japanese tanka (traditionally known as waka) date back at least to the 1865 translation of the classic Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (c. early 13th century); an early publication of originally English tanka dates to 1899. In the United States, the publication of tanka in Japanese and in English translation acquires extra impetus after World War II, and is followed by a rise of the genre's popularity among native speakers of English. Etymology and form In the time of the Man'y≈çsh≈´ (compiled after 759 AD), the term tanka was used to distinguish \\"short poems\\" from the longer . In the ninth and tenth centuries, however, notably with the compilation of the Kokin Wakash≈´, the short poem became the dominant form of poetry in Japan, and the originally general word became the standard name for this form.Keene, Donald. A History of Japanese Literature: Volume 1. NY: Columbia University Press, 1999. p98, 164. Japanese poet and critic Masaoka Shiki revived the term tanka in the early twentieth century as part of his tanka modernization project, similar to his revision of the term haiku. Tanka consist of five units (often treated as separate lines when romanized or translated) usually with a pattern of 5-7-5-7-7 sounds (onji is an inaccurate term for this). The group of the first three, 5-7-5, is called the kami-no-ku (\\"upper phrase\\"), and the second, 7-7, is called the shimo-no-ku (\\"lower phrase\\"). In English, the units are often rendered as lines and indeed some modern Japanese poets have printed them as such; Hiroaki Sato notes that such lineation is not representative of the Japanese, where mono-linear units are the norm, and Mark Morris comments that tanka and other forms are \\"packed\\" by \\"Anglophone scholars...into a limited repertoire of rectilinear containers\\". Composition and translation As reviewers of translated work have pointed out, translating tanka, a form heavily dependent on \\"variation of sounds\\", is \\"no easy task\\" and \\"choices of language and interpretation are essentially a matter of taste\\". History =Early history= The earliest work of Japanese literature to be translated into English was the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, a collection of waka compiled by Fujiwara no Teika in the thirteenth century. Frederick Victor Dickins (1835-1915), a medical officer in the Royal Navy, translated and published the work anonymously in the March, 1865 issue of the Chinese and Japanese Repository. Another early translation into English is Yone Noguchi's translation of the same work, and William N. Porter published translations from it in 1909. The first North American tanka collections are Sadakichi Hartmann's Tanka and Haika: Japanese Rhythms (1916) and Jun Fujita's Tanka: Poems in Exile (1923). The first known anthology containing original English tanka was Tanka and Hokku, edited by Edith Brown Mirick, in 1931. The first North American collection containing tanka in English written by a person not of Japanese descent was Blue Is the Iris, by Eleanor Chaney Grubb, 1949. =Post-WW II= Tanka publication in English was sporadic until after World War II when various Japanese North American tanka poets began publishing anthologies and collections in both Japanese and English, as well as bi- lingual editions. These efforts apparently began immediately after the poets were released from internment camps in Canada and the United States. An important contributor was Yoshihiko Tomari, active in the Tule Lake Segregation Center, where he saw tanka as \\"an active spiritual and cultural force for his people\\" and organized \\"a tanka network among the camps, gathered poems, produced mimeographed publications, and circulated them to other camps\\". A notable American translator and writer of tanka was Lucille Nixon, who in 1957 became the first foreigner selected to participate in the Utakai Hajime, the Imperial New Year‚Äôs Poetry Reading of Japan. Nixon had been part of the \\"Totsukuni Tankakai\\", the Totsukana Tanka Society of San Francisco, which was founded in 1927 by Yoshihiko Tomari. She was tutored in Japanese and tanka by her housekeeper, Tomoe Tana. With Tana, she published a volume of tanka translations by Japanese Americans into English, Sounds from the Unknown (1963). The journal of the Totsukuni Tankakai published tanka in English as well as Japanese during the 1950s, making it the first known journal to publish tanka in English. The second English-language journal to specifically include tanka was SCTH (Sonnet Cinquain Tanka Haiku) published from 1964 - 1980, edited by Foster and Rhoda de Long Jewell. In 1972, the Kisaragi Poem Study Group's Maple: poetry by Japanese Canadians with English translation appeared, a collection like Sounds of the Unknown. In the United Kingdom, the first known English-language anthology was the Starving sparrow temple anthology: haiku, tanka, linked verse and other pieces edited by William E. Watt, 1971. By 1969, tanka started appearing in anthologies of student work published by public schools in the United States. One notable poet composing tanka in English in the 1970s was Kenneth Rexroth, a poet of the so-called San Francisco Renaissance‚ÄîRexroth had \\"thorough[ly] assimilated\\" Japanese poetry as a translator of for instance Fujiwara no Teika and several poems from the Man'y≈çsh≈´ (compiled 8th century), and composed his own tanka in a similar style. The popularity of tanka compared to that of haiku has remained minor, with tanka often being mistaken for haiku, despite the confessional nature of tanka. Organizations and journals Tanka journals were published in the United States in Japanese starting in the 1920s. Bilingual English-Japanese journals were published in the 1950s. Only recently have there been journals devoted exclusively to tanka in English, including American Tanka (1996) in the United States, edited by Laura Maffei, and Tangled Hair in Britain, edited by John Barlow. The first English-language tanka journal, Five Lines Down, began in 1994, but lasted only a few issues. Atlas Poetica has been published since 2007.http://atlaspoetica.org/?page_id=545 Atlas Poetica: A Journal of Poetry of Place in Contemporary Tanka The Tanka Chapter of the Chaparral Poets of California was operating in the early 60s, as mentioned in the Introduction to Sounds from the Unknown (1963), but it is not known whether they published a journal. They published an anthology in 1975, entitled simply Tanka. The Tanka Chapter is no longer extant.'A History of Tanka in English Pt I : The North American Foundation, 1899 - 1985' at Tanka Central, 2011. No new anthologies were published in English until Footsteps in the Fog, edited by Michael Dylan Welch, published in 1994 by Press Here, and then Wind Five Folded, edited by Jane and Werner Reichhold, published later in 1994 by AHA Books. The Tanka Society of America was founded by Michael Dylan Welch in April 2000 in Decatur, Illinois.A Chat about Tanka.

This policy was most prevalent in the 19th century. It attempted to restrain imports to protect Northern industries. It was opposed by Southern states that wanted free trade to expand cotton and other agricultural exports. Protectionist measures included tariffs and quotas on imported goods, along with subsidies and other means, to ensure fair competition between imported goods and local goods.  History  Average tariff rates (France, UK, US) Average Tariff Rates in US (1821‚Äì2016) U.S. Trade Balance and Trade Policy (1895‚Äì2015) Average Tariff Rates on manufactured products Britain was the first country to successfully use a large-scale infant industry promotion strategy. However, its most ardent user was the U.S.; the economic historian Paul Bairoch once called it \\"the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism\\" (Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes, Bairoch). Britain initially did not want to industrialize the American colonies, and implemented policies to that effect (for example, banning high value-added manufacturing activities). Thus, the American Revolution was, to some extent, a war against this policy, in which the commercial elite of the colonies rebelled against being forced to play a lesser role in the emerging Atlantic economy. This explains why, after independence, the Tariff Act of 1789 was the second bill of the Republic signed by President Washington allowing Congress to impose a fixed tariff of 5% on all imports, with a few exceptions. Most American intellectuals and politicians during the country's catching-up period felt that the free trade theory advocated by British classical economists was not suited to their country. The US went against the advice of economists like Adam Smith, Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say and tried to protect its industries. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States (1789-1795) and economist Daniel Raymond were the first theorists to present the argument of the emerging industry, not the German economist Friedrich List (Corden, 1974; Reinert, 1996). Indeed, List started out as a free trade advocate and only converted to the infant industry argument following his exile in the U.S (1825‚Äì1830) (Henderson, 1983; Reinert, 1998). Hamilton feared that Britain's policy towards the colonies would condemn the United States to be only producers of agricultural products and raw materials. Washington and Hamilton believed that political independence was predicated upon economic independence. Increasing the domestic supply of manufactured goods, particularly war materials, was seen as an issue of national security. In his Reports, Hamilton argued that the competition from abroad and the \\"forces of habit\\" would mean that new industries that could soon become internationally competitive (\\"infant industries\\") would not be started in the United States, unless the initial losses were guaranteed by government aid (Conkin, 1980). According to him, this aid could take the form of import duties or, in rare cases, prohibition of imports. He called for customs barriers to allow American industrial development and to help protect infant industries, including bounties (subsidies) derived in part from those tariffs. He also believed that duties on raw materials should be generally low (Dorfman & Tugwell, Early American Policy, 1960). Hamilton explained that despite an initial \\"increase of price\\" caused by regulations that control foreign competition, once a \\"domestic manufacture has attained to perfection ... it invariably becomes cheaper\\". The Congress passed a tariff act (1789), imposing a 5% flat rate tariff on all imports. (Garraty & Carnes, 2000) (Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes, Bairoch). Between 1792 and the war with Britain in 1812, the average tariff level remained around 12.5%. In 1812 all tariffs were doubled to an average of 25% in order to cope with the increase in public expenditure due to the war. A significant shift in policy occurred in 1816, when a new law was introduced to keep the tariff level close to the wartime level‚Äîespecially protected were cotton, woolen, and iron goods (The Age of Enterprise: A Social History of Industrial America, Thomas C. Cochran, William Miller, 1942), (Garraty & Carnes, 2000). The American industrial interests that had blossomed because of the tariff lobbied to keep it, and had it raised to 35 percent in 1816. The public approved, and by 1820, America's average tariff was up to 40 percent. According to Michael Lind, protectionism was America's de facto policy from the passage of the Tariff of 1816 to World War II, \\"switching to free trade only in 1945\\".Michael Lind, \\"Free Trade Fallacy\\", New America Foundation, January 1, 2003. There was a brief episode of free trade from 1846, coinciding with the zenith of classical liberalism in Europe, during which American tariffs were lowered. But this was followed by a series of recessions and the panic of 1857, which eventually led to higher tariff demands than President James Buchanan, signed in 1861 (Morrill Tariff). In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Hamilton's themes within the Whig Party under the name \\"American System (Abraham Lincoln and the Tariff, R. Luthin, 1944)\\". The American Civil War (1861-1865) was fought over the issue of tariffs as well as slavery. At the time of independence, the agrarian interests of the South were opposed to any protection, while the manufacturing interests of the North wanted to maintain it. The fledgling Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a \\"Henry Clay tariff Whig\\", strongly opposed free trade, and implemented a 44-percent tariff during the Civil War‚Äîin part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort, and to protect favored industries. In 1847, he declared: \\"Give us a protective tariff, and we shall have the greatest nation on earth\\". From 1871 to 1913, \\"the average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [and] gross national product (GNP) grew 4.3 percent annually, twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century,\\" notes Alfred Eckes Jr, chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan notes. In 1896, the GOP pledged a platform of \\"renewing and emphasizing our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman\\". The protectionist period was the golden age of American industry, when America's economic performance surpassed the rest of the world by the greatest margin. It was the era in which the U.S. transformed itself from an agricultural backwater into the greatest economic power in the history of the world. It was only after the Second World War that the U.S. liberalized its trade (although not as unequivocally as Britain did in the midnineteenth century). Southern states Historically, slave-holding states had little perceived need for mechanization because of the low cost of manual slave labor. They supplied raw cotton to Britain, which supported free trade. Northern states Northern states sought to develop manufacturing industries and sought protections to allow nascent Northern manufacturers to compete with their more sophisticated British competitors. Throughout the 19th century, leading US politicians, including Senator Henry Clay, supported Hamilton's approach within the Whig Party under the name \\"American System.\\" The opposed Southern Democratic Party contested elections throughout the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s in part over the issue of protection of industry. However, Southern Democrats were never as strong in the U.S. House of Representatives as the more populous North. The Northern Whigs achieved higher protective tariffs over the South's bitter resistance. One Southern state precipitated what came to be called the Nullification Crisis, over the issue of tariffs, arguing that states had the right to ignore federal laws. Mostly over the issue of abolition and other scandals, the Whigs collapsed, leaving a void which the fledgling Republican Party, led by Abraham Lincoln filled. Lincoln, who called himself a \\"Henry Clay tariff Whig\\", strongly opposed free trade. He implemented a 44% tariff during the American Civil War in part to pay for the building of the Union Pacific Railroad, the war effort and to protect American industry. By President Lincoln's term, the northern manufacturing states had ten times the GDP of the South. With this advantage, the North was able to starve the South of weapons through a near total blockade, while supplying its own army with everything from heavy artillery to Henry repeating rifles. With the Northern victory, Republican dominance was assured. Republicans continued to dominate American politics until the early 20th century. President Ulysses S. Grant stated: > For centuries England has relied on protection, has carried it to extremes > and has obtained satisfactory results from it. There is no doubt that it is > to this system that it owes its present strength. After two centuries, > England has found it convenient to adopt free trade because it thinks that > protection can no longer offer it anything. Very well then, Gentlemen, my > knowledge of our country leads me to believe that within 200 years, when > America has gotten out of protection all that it can offer, it too will > adopt free trade. Southern Democrats gradually rebuilt their party and allied themselves with Northern Progressives. They had many differences, but both opposed the corporate trusts that had emerged. This marriage of convenience to face a common enemy reinvigorated the Democratic Party, catapulting them to power.  Colonial Era to 1789  In the colonial era, before 1775, nearly every colony levied its own tariffs, usually with lower rates for British products. There were taxes on ships (on a tonnage basis), import taxes on slaves, export taxes on tobacco, and import taxes on alcoholic beverages. The London government insisted on a policy of mercantilism whereby only British ships could trade in the colonies. In defiance, some American merchants engaged in smuggling.John W. Tyler, Smugglers and Patriots: Boston Merchants and the Advent of the American Revolution (1986) online review During the Revolution, the British blockade from 1775 to 1783 largely ended foreign trade. In the 1783‚Äì89 Confederation Period, each state set up its own trade rules, often imposing tariffs or restrictions on neighboring states. The new Constitution, which went into effect in 1789, banned interstate tariffs or trade restrictions, as well as state taxes on exports.Dewey, Financial History of the United States (5th ed. 1915) ch. 1‚Äì3  Early National period, 1789‚Äì1828  The framers of the United States Constitution gave the federal government authority to tax, stating that Congress has the power to \\"... lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\\" and also \\"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\\" Tariffs between states is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, and all domestically made products can be imported or shipped to another state tax- free. Responding to an urgent need for revenue and a trade imbalance with England that was fast destroying the infant American industries and draining the nation of its currency, the First United States Congress passed, and President George Washington signed, the Hamilton Tariff of 1789, which authorized the collection of duties on imported goods. Customs duties as set by tariff rates up to 1860 were usually about 80‚Äì95% of all federal revenue. Having just fought a war over taxation (among other things) the U.S. Congress wanted a reliable source of income that was relatively unobtrusive and easy to collect. It also sought to protect the infant industries that had developed during the war but which were now threatened by cheaper imports, especially from England. Tariffs and excise taxes were authorized by the United States Constitution and recommended by the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton in 1789 to tax foreign imports and set up low excise taxes on whiskey and a few other products to provide the Federal Government with enough money to pay its operating expenses and to redeem at full value U.S. Federal debts and the debts the states had accumulated during the Revolutionary War. The Congress set low excise taxes on only a few goods, such as, whiskey, rum, tobacco, snuff and refined sugar. The tax on whiskey was highly controversial and set of massive protests by Western Farmers in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, which was suppressed by General Washington at the head of an army. The whiskey excise tax collected so little and was so despised it was abolished by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802.Dewey, Financial History of the United States (5th ed. 1915) ch. 4‚Äì5 All tariffs were on a long list of goods (dutiable goods) with different customs rates and some goods on a \\"free\\" list. Congress spent enormous amounts of time figuring out these tariff import tax schedules. With tariffs providing the basic federal revenue, an embargo on trade, or an enemy blockade, would threaten havoc. This happened in connection with the American economic warfare against Britain in the 1807‚Äì15 period. In 1807 imports dropped by more than half and some products became much more expensive or unobtainable. Congress passed the Embargo Act of 1807 and the Non-Intercourse Act (1809) to punish British and French governments for their actions; unfortunately their main effect was to reduce imports even more. The War of 1812 brought a similar set of problems as U.S. trade was again restricted by British naval blockades. The fiscal crisis was made much worse by the abolition of the First Bank of the U.S., which was the national bank. It was reestablished right after the war.Dewey, Financial History of the United States (5th ed. 1915) ch. 6‚Äì7 The lack of imported goods relatively quickly gave very strong incentives to start building several U.S. industries in the Northeast. Textiles and machinery especially grew. Many new industries were set up and run profitably during the wars and about half of them failed after hostilities ceased and normal imports resumed. Industry in the U.S. was advancing up the skill set, innovation knowledge and organization curve. The Tariff Act of 1789 imposed the first national source of revenue for the newly formed United States. The new U.S. Constitution ratified in 1789, allowed only the federal government to levy uniform tariffs. Only the federal government could set tariff rates (customs), so the old system of separate state rates disappeared. The new law taxed all imports at rates from 5 to 15 percent. These rates were primarily designed to generate revenue to pay the annual expenses of the federal government and the national debt and the debts the states had accumulated during the American War of Independence and to also promote manufactures and independence from foreign nations, especially for defense needs. Hamilton believed that all Revolutionary War debt should be paid in full to establish and keep U.S. financial credibility. In addition to income in his Report on Manufactures Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton proposed a far-reaching plan to use protective tariffs as a lever for rapid industrialization. In the late 18th century the industrial age was just starting and the United States had little or no textile industry‚Äîthe heart of the early Industrial Revolution. The British government having just lost the Revolutionary War tried to maintain their near monopoly on cheap and efficient textile manufacturing by prohibiting the export of textile machines, machine models or the emigration of people familiar with these machines. Clothing in the early United States was nearly all hand made by a very time consuming and expensive process‚Äîjust like it had been made for centuries before. The new textile manufacturing techniques in Britain were often over thirty times cheaper as well as being easier to use, more efficient and productive. Hamilton believed that a stiff tariff on imports would not only raise income but \\"protect\\" and help subsidize early efforts at setting up manufacturing facilities that could compete with British products.Douglas A. Irwin, \\"The Aftermath of Hamilton's 'Report on Manufactures'\\", Journal of Economic History, Sept 2004, Vol. 64, Issue 3, pp. 800‚Äì21 Samuel Slater in 1789 emigrated (illegally since he was familiar with textile manufacturing) from Britain. Looking for opportunities he heard of the failing attempts at making cotton mills in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Contacting the owners he promised to see if he could fix their mills‚Äîthey offered him a full partnership if he succeeded. Declaring their early attempts unworkable he proceeded from January 1790 to December 1790 to build the first operational textile manufacturing facility in the United States. The Industrial Revolution was off and running in the United States. Initially the cost of their textiles was slightly higher than the cost of equivalent British goods but the tariff helped protect their early start-up industry.Barbara M. Tucker, and Kenneth H. Tucker, Industrializing Antebellum America: The Rise of Manufacturing Entrepreneurs in the Early Republic (2008) The high protectionism tariffs Hamilton originally called for were not adopted until after the War of 1812, when nationalists such as Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun saw the need for more federal income and more industry. In wartime, they declared, having a home industry was a necessity to avoid shortages. Likewise owners of the small new factories that were springing up in the northeast to mass-produce boots, hats, nails and other common items wanted higher tariffs that would significantly protect them for a time from more efficient British producers. A 10% discount on the customs tax was offered on items imported in American ships, so that the American merchant marine would be supported.Taussig, The Tariff History of the United States (8th edition (1931), ch. 1 Once industrialization and mass production started, the demand for higher and higher tariffs came from manufacturers and factory workers. They believed that their businesses should be protected from the lower wages and more efficient factories of Britain and the rest of Europe. Nearly every northern Congressman was eager to logroll a higher tariff rate for his local industry. Senator Daniel Webster, formerly a spokesperson for Boston's merchants who imported goods (and wanted low tariffs), switched dramatically to represent the manufacturing interests in the Tariff of 1824. Rates were especially high for bolts of cloth and for bar iron, of which Britain was a low-cost producer. The culmination came in the Tariff of 1828, ridiculed by free traders as the \\"Tariff of Abominations\\", with import custom duties averaging over 25 percent. Intense political opposition to higher tariffs came from Southern Democrats and plantation owners in South Carolina who had little manufacturing industry and imported some products with high tariffs. They would have to pay more for imports. They claimed their economic interest was being unfairly injured. They attempted to \\"nullify\\" the federal tariff and spoke of secession from the Union (see the Nullification Crisis). President Andrew Jackson let it be known he would use the U.S. Army to enforce the law, and no state supported the South Carolina call for nullification. A compromise ended the crisis included a lowering of the average tariff rate over ten years to a rate of 15% to 20%.Taussig, The Tariff History of the United States (8th edition (1931), ch. 2  Second Party System, 1829‚Äì1859  Tariffs soon became a major political issue as the Whigs (1832‚Äì1852) and (after 1854) the Republicans wanted to protect their mostly northern industries and constituents by voting for higher tariffs and the Southern Democrats, which had very little industry but imported many goods voted for lower tariffs. Each party as it came into power voted to raise or lower tariffs under the constraints that the Federal Government always needed a certain level of revenues. The United States public debt was paid off in 1834 and President Andrew Jackson, a strong Southern Democrat, oversaw the cutting of the tariff rates roughly in half and eliminating nearly all federal excise taxes in about 1835. Henry Clay and his Whig Party, envisioning a rapid modernization based on highly productive factories, sought a high tariff. Their key argument was that startup factories, or \\"infant industries\\", would at first be less efficient than European (British) producers. Furthermore, American factory workers were paid higher wages than their European competitors. The arguments proved highly persuasive in industrial districts. Clay's position was adopted in the 1828 and 1832 Tariff Acts. The Nullification Crisis forced a partial abandonment of the Whig position. When the Whigs won victories in the 1840 and 1842 elections, taking control of Congress, they re-instituted higher tariffs with the Tariff of 1842.Taussig, Tariff History pp. 109‚Äì24 In examining these debates Moore finds that they were not precursors to Civil War. Instead they looked backward and continued the old debate whether foreign trade policy should embrace free trade or protectionism. = Walker Tariff = The Democrats won in 1845, electing James K. Polk as president. Polk succeeded in passing the Walker tariff of 1846 by uniting the rural and agricultural factions of the entire country for lower tariffs. They sought a level of a \\"tariff for revenue only\\" that would pay the cost of government but not show favoritism to one section or economic sector at the expense of another. The Walker Tariff actually increased trade with Britain and others and brought in more revenue to the federal treasury than the higher tariff. The average tariff on the Walker Tariff was about 25%. While protectionists in Pennsylvania and neighboring states were angered, the South achieved its goal of setting low tariff rates before the Civil War.Taussig, Tariff History pp. 124‚Äì54 = Low tariff of 1857 = The Walker Tariff remained in place until 1857, when a nonpartisan coalition lowered them again with the Tariff of 1857 to 18%. This was in response to the British repeal of their protectionist \\"Corn Laws\\".Scott C. James and David E. Lake, \\"The second face of hegemony: Britain's repeal of the Corn Laws and the American Walker Tariff of 1846\\", International Organization, Winter 1989, Vol. 43, Issue 1, pp. 1‚Äì28 The Democrats in Congress, dominated by Southern Democrats, wrote and passed the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates, so that the 1857 rates were down to about 15%, a move that boosted trade so overwhelmingly that revenues actually increased, from just over $20 million in 1840 ($ billion in dollars), to more than $80 million by 1856 ($ billion). The South had almost no complaints but the low rates angered many Northern industrialists and factory workers, especially in Pennsylvania, who demanded protection for their growing iron industry. The Republican Party replaced the Whigs in 1854 and also favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth; it was part of the 1860 Republican platform. The Morrill Tariff significantly raising tariff rates became possible only after the Southern Senators walked out of Congress when their states left the Union, leaving a Republican majority. It was signed by Democratic President James Buchanan in early March 1861 shortly before President Abraham Lincoln took office. Pennsylvania iron mills and New England woolen mills mobilized businessmen and workers to call for high tariffs, but Republican merchants wanted low tariffs. The high tariff advocates lost in 1857, but stepped up their campaign by blaming the economic recession of 1857 on the lower rates. Economist Henry Charles Carey of Philadelphia was the most outspoken advocate, along with Horace Greeley and his influential newspaper, the New-York Tribune. Increases were finally enacted in February 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress on the eve of the Civil War.Taussig, The Tariff History of the United States (1931), pp. 123‚Äì61Richard Hofstadter, \\"The Tariff Issue on the Eve of the Civil War\\", The American Historical Review (1938) 44#1 pp. 50‚Äì55 full text in JSTOR Some historians in recent decades have minimized the tariff issue as a cause of the war, noting that few people in 1860‚Äì61 said it was of central importance to them. Compromises were proposed in 1860‚Äì61 to save the Union, but they did not involve the tariff.Robert Gray Gunderson, Old Gentlemen's Convention: The Washington Peace Conference of 1861 (1961) Arguably, the effects of a tariff enacted in March 1861 could have made little impact upon any delegation which met prior to its signing. It is indicative of the Northern industrial supported and anti-agrarian position of that 1861 Republican controlled congress. Some secessionist documents do mention a tariff issue, though not nearly as often as the preservation of the impactful economic institution of slavery. However, a few libertarian economists place more importance on the tariff issue.Mark Thornton and Robert B. Ekelund, Jr., Tariffs, Blockades, and Inflation: The Economics of the Civil War (2004)  1860‚Äì1912  = Civil War = During the war far more revenue was needed, so the rates were raised again and again, along with many other taxes such as excise taxes on luxuries and income taxes on the rich.Taussig, The Tariff History of the United States (1931), pp. 155‚Äì70 By far most of the wartime government revenue came from bonds and loans ($2.6 billion), not taxes ($357 million) or tariffs ($305 million).Dewey, Financial History (1915) p. 299 The Morrill Tariff took effect a few weeks before the war began on April 12, 1861, and was not collected in the South. The Confederate States of America (CSA) passed its own tariff of about 15% on most items, including many items that previously were duty-free from the North. Previously tariffs between states were prohibited. The Confederates believed that they could finance their government by tariffs. The anticipated tariff revenue never appeared as the Union Navy blockaded their ports and the Union army restricted their trade with the Northern states. The Confederacy collected a mere $3.5 million in tariff revenue from the Civil War start to end and had to resort to inflation and confiscation instead for revenue. = Reconstruction era = Historian Howard K. Beale argued that high tariffs were needed during the Civil War, but were retained after the war for the benefit of Northern industrialists, who would otherwise lose markets and profits. To keep political control of Congress, Beale argued, Northern Industrialists worked through the Republican Party and supported Reconstruction policies that kept low-tariff Southern whites out of power. The Beale thesis was widely disseminated by the influential survey of Charles A. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927). In the late 1950s historians rejected the Beale‚ÄìBeard thesis by showing that Northern businessmen were evenly divided on the tariff, and were not using Reconstruction policies to support it.Stanley Coben, \\"Northeastern Business and Radical Reconstruction: A Re-Examination.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1959): 67‚Äì90. in JSTOR = Politics of protection = The iron and steel industry, and the wool industry, were the well-organized interests groups that demanded (and usually obtained) high tariffs through support of the Republican Party. Industrial workers had much higher wages than their European counterparts, and they credited it to the tariff and voted Republican.Paul H. Tedesco, Patriotism, Protection, and Prosperity: James Moore Swank, the American Iron and Steel Association, and the Tariff, 1873‚Äì1913 (Garland, 1985.) Democrats were divided on the issue, in large part because of pro-tariff elements in the Pennsylvania party who wanted to protect the growing iron industry, as well as pockets of high tariff support in nearby industrializing states. However President Grover Cleveland made low tariffs the centerpiece of Democratic Party policies in the late 1880s. His argument is that high tariffs were an unnecessary and unfair tax on consumers. The South and West generally supported low tariffs, and the industrial East high tariffs.Joanne R. Reitano, The Tariff Question in the Gilded Age: The Great Debate of 1888 (Penn State Press, 1994) Republican William McKinley was the outstanding spokesman for high tariffs, promising it would bring prosperity for all groups.H. Wayne Morgan, William McKinley and His America (1965)F. W. Taussig, \\"The McKinley Tariff Act.\\" The Economic Journal (1891) 1#2 pp: 326‚Äì350. in JSTOR After the Civil War, high tariffs remained as the Republican Party remained in office and the Southern Democrats were restricted from office. Advocates insisted that tariffs brought prosperity to the nation as a whole and no one was really injured. As industrialization proceeded apace throughout the Northeast, some Democrats, especially Pennsylvanians, became high tariff advocates. = Farmers and wool = The Republican high tariff advocates appealed to farmers with the theme that high-wage factory workers would pay premium prices for foodstuffs. This was the \\"home market\\" idea, and it won over most farmers in the Northeast, but it had little relevance to the southern and western farmers who exported most of their cotton, tobacco and wheat. In the late 1860s the wool manufacturers (based near Boston and Philadelphia) formed the first national lobby, and cut deals with wool-growing farmers in several states. Their challenge was that fastidious wool producers in Britain and Australia marketed a higher quality fleece than the careless Americans, and that British manufacturers had costs as low as the American mills. The result was a wool tariff that helped the farmers by a high rate on imported wool‚Äîa tariff the American manufacturers had to pay‚Äîtogether with a high tariff on finished woolens and worsted goods.Tom E. Terrill, The Tariff, Politics, and American Foreign Policy 1874‚Äì1901 (1973) = U.S. industrial output = Apart from wool and woolens, American industry and agriculture‚Äîand industrial workers‚Äîhad become the most efficient in the world by the 1880s as they took the lead in the worldwide Industrial Revolution. They were not at risk from cheap imports. No other country had the industrial capacity, large market, the high efficiency and low costs, or the complex distribution system needed to compete in the vast American market. Indeed, it was the British who watched in stunned horror as cheaper American products flooded their home islands. Wailed the London Daily Mail in 1900, > We have lost to the American manufacturer electrical machinery, locomotives, > steel rails, sugar-producing and agricultural machinery, and latterly even > stationary engines, the pride and backbone of the British engineering > industry. Nevertheless, some American manufacturers and union workers demanded the high tariff be maintained. The tariff represented a complex balance of forces. Railroads, for example, consumed vast quantities of steel. To the extent tariffs raised steel prices, they paid much more making possible the U.S steel industry's massive investment to expand capacity and switch to the Bessemer process and later to the open hearth furnace. Between 1867 and 1900 U.S. steel production increased more than 500 times from 22,000 tons to 11,400,000 tons and Bessemer steel rails, first made in the U.S that would last 18 years under heavy traffic, would come to replace the old wrought iron rail that could only endure two years under light service.Douglas A. Fisher, Steel Serves the Nation, U.S. Steel, 1951, p. 15 Taussig says that in 1881, British steel rails sold for $31 a ton, and if Americans imported them they paid a $28/ton tariff, giving $59/ton for an imported ton of rails. American mills charged $61 a ton‚Äîand made a huge profit, which was then reinvested into increased capacity, higher quality steels and more efficient production. By 1897 the American steel rail price had dropped to $19.60 per ton compared to the British price at $21.00‚Äînot including the $7.84 duty charge‚Äîdemonstrating that the tariff had performed its purpose of giving the industry time to become competitive.F. W. Taussig, The Tariff History Of The United States, 1909 edition, p. 259 Then the U.S. steel industry became an exporter of steel rail to England selling below the British price and during WW I would become the largest supplier of steel to the allies. From 1915 through 1918, the largest American steel company, U.S. Steel, alone delivered more steel each year than Germany and Austria-Hungary combined, totalling 99,700,000 tons during WW I.Douglas A. Fisher, Steel Serves the Nation, U.S. Steel, 1951, p. 48 The Republicans became masters of negotiating exceedingly complex arrangements so that inside each of their congressional districts there were more satisfied \\"winners\\" than disgruntled \\"losers\\". The tariff after 1880 was an ideological relic with no longer any economic rationale. = Cleveland tariff policy = Democratic President Grover Cleveland redefined the issue in 1887, with his stunning attack on the tariff as inherently corrupt, opposed to true republicanism, and inefficient to boot: \\"When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise ... it is plain that the exaction of more than [minimal taxes] is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice.\\" The election of 1888 was fought primarily over the tariff issue, and Cleveland lost.H. Wayne Morgan, From Hayes to McKinley: National Party Politics, 1877‚Äì1896 (1969) Republican Congressman William McKinley argued, > Free foreign trade gives our money, our manufactures, and our markets to > other nations to the injury of our labor, our tradespeople, and our farmers. > Protection keeps money, markets, and manufactures at home for the benefit of > our own people. Democrats campaigned energetically against the high McKinley Tariff of 1890, and scored sweeping gains that year; they restored Cleveland to the White House in 1892. The severe depression that started in 1893 ripped apart the Democratic party. Cleveland and the pro-business Bourbon Democrats insisted on a much lower tariff. His problem was that Democratic electoral successes had brought in Democratic congressmen from industrial districts who were willing to raise rates to benefit their constituents. The Wilson‚ÄìGorman Tariff Act of 1894 did lower overall rates from 50 percent to 42 percent, but contained so many concessions to protectionism that Cleveland refused to sign it (it became law anyway).Festus P. Summers, William L. Wilson and Tariff Reform, a Biography (1953) = McKinley tariff policy = President Teddy Roosevelt watches GOP team pull apart on tariff issue McKinley campaigned heavily in 1896 on the high tariff as a positive solution to depression. Promising protection and prosperity to every economic sector, he won a smashing victory. The Republicans rushed through the Dingley Tariff in 1897, boosting rates back to the 50 percent level. Democrats responded that the high rates created government sponsored \\"trusts\\" (monopolies) and led to higher consumer prices. McKinley won reelection by an even bigger landslide and started talking about a post-tariff era of reciprocal trade agreements. Reciprocity went nowhere; McKinley's vision was a half century too early.Harold U. Faulkner, Politics, Reform, and Expansion, 1890‚Äì1900 (1959) The Republicans split bitterly on the Payne‚ÄìAldrich Tariff of 1909. Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901‚Äì1909) saw the tariff issue was ripping his party apart, so he postponed any consideration of it. The delicate balance flew apart on under Republican William Howard Taft. He campaigned for president in 1908 for tariff \\"reform\\", which everyone assumed meant lower rates. The House lowered rates with the Payne Bill, then sent it to the Senate where Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich mobilized high-rate Senators. Aldrich was a New England businessman and a master of the complexities of the tariff, the Midwestern Republican insurgents were rhetoricians and lawyers who distrusted the special interests and assumed the tariff was \\"sheer robbery\\" at the expense of the ordinary consumer. Rural America believed that its superior morality deserved special protection, while the dastardly immorality of the trusts‚Äîand cities generally‚Äîmerited financial punishment. Aldrich baited them. Did the insurgents want lower tariffs? His wickedly clever Payne‚ÄìAldrich Tariff Act of 1909 lowered the protection on Midwestern farm products, while raising rates favorable to his Northeast.David W. Detzer, \\"Businessmen, Reformers, and Tariff Revision: The Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909\\", Historian, (1973) 35#2 pp. 196‚Äì204, online By 1913 with the new income tax generating revenue, the Democrats in Congress were able to reduce rates with the Underwood Tariff. The outbreak of war in 1914 made the impact of tariffs of much less importance compared to war contracts. When the Republicans returned to power the returned the rates to a high level in the Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff of 1922. The next raise came with the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act of 1930 at the start of the Great Depression. = Tariff with Canada = The Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Reciprocity Treaty increased trade between 1855 and its ending in 1866. When it ended Canada turned to tariffs. The National Policy was a Canadian economic program introduced by John A. Macdonald's Conservative Party in 1879 after it returned to power. It had been an official policy, however, since 1876. It was based on high tariffs to protect Canada's manufacturing industry. Macdonald campaigned on the policy in the 1878 election, and handily beat the Liberal Party, which supported free trade. Efforts to restore free trade with Canada collapsed when Canada rejected a proposed reciprocity treaty in fear of American imperialism in the 1911 federal election. Taft negotiated a reciprocity agreement with Canada, that had the effect of sharply lowering tariffs. Democrats supported the plan but Midwestern Republicans bitterly opposed it. Barnstorming the country for his agreement, Taft undiplomatically pointed to the inevitable integration of the North American economy, and suggested that Canada should come to a \\"parting of the ways\\" with Britain. Canada's Conservative Party, under the leadership of Robert Borden, now had an issue to regain power from the low- tariff Liberals; after a surge of pro-imperial anti-Americanism, the Conservatives won. Ottawa rejected reciprocity, reasserted the National Policy and went to London first for new financial and trade deals. The Payne Aldrich Tariff of 1909 actually changed little and had slight economic impact one way or the other, but the political impact was enormous. The insurgents felt tricked and defeated and swore vengeance against Wall Street and its minions Taft and Aldrich. The insurgency led to a fatal split down the middle in 1912 as the GOP lost its balance wheel.Paolo Enrico Coletta, The Presidency of William Howard Taft (1973)  1913 to present  Woodrow Wilson made a drastic lowering of tariff rates a major priority for his presidency. The 1913 Underwood Tariff cut rates, but the coming of World War I in 1914 radically revised trade patterns. Reduced trade and, especially, the new revenues generated by the federal income tax (bolstered by the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913) made tariffs much less important in terms of economic impact and political rhetoric. The Wilson administration desired a 'revamping' of the current banking system, \\"...so that the banks may be the instruments, not the masters, of business and of individual enterprise and initiative.\\". President Wilson achieved this in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Working with the bullish Senator Aldrich and former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, he perfected a way to centralize the banking system to allow Congress to closely allocate paper money production. The Federal Reserve Act, with the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, would create a trend of new forms of government funding. When the Republicans regained power after the war they restored the usual high rates, with the Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff of 1922. When the Great Depression hit, international trade shrank drastically. The crisis baffled the GOP, and it tried to raise tariffs again with the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act of 1930. This time it backfired, as Canada, Britain, Germany, France and other industrial countries retaliated with their own tariffs and special, bilateral trade deals. American imports and exports both went into a tailspin. Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Dealers made promises about lowering tariffs on a reciprocal country-by- country basis (which they did), hoping this would expand foreign trade (which it did not.) Frustrated, they gave much more attention to domestic remedies for the depression; by 1936 the tariff issue had faded from politics, and the revenue it raised was small. In World War II, both tariffs and reciprocity were insignificant compared to trade channeled through Lend-Lease.Edward S. Kaplan, American Trade Policy: 1923‚Äì1995 (1996) = Tariffs and Great Depression = Most economists hold the opinion that the tariff act did not greatly worsen the great depression: Milton Friedman also held the opinion that the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 did not cause the Great Depression. Douglas A. Irwin writes : \\"most economists, both liberal and conservative, doubt that Smoot Hawley played much of a role in the subsequent contraction.\\" William Bernstein writes \\"most economic historians now believe that only a minuscule part of that huge loss of both world GDP and the United States' GDP can be ascribed to the tariff wars \\"because trade was only nine percent of global output, not enough to account for the seventeen percent drop in GDP following the Crash. He thinks the damage done could not possibly have exceeded 2 percent of world GDP and tariff \\"didn't even significantly deepen the Great Depression.\\" Peter Temin, explains a tariff is an expansionary policy, like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP in the next two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concludes that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small. (Temin, P. 1989. Lessons from the Great Depression, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass) Nobel laureate Maurice Allais, thinks that tariff was rather helpful in the face of deregulation of competition in the global labor market and excessively loose credit prior to the Crash which, according to him, caused the crisis Financial and banking sectors. He notes higher trade barriers were partly a means to protect domestic demand from deflation and external disturbances. He observes domestic production in the major industrialized countries fell faster than international trade contracted; if contraction of foreign trade had been the cause of the Depression, he argues, the opposite should have occurred. So, the decline in trade between 1929 and 1933 was a consequence of the Depression, not a cause. Most of the trade contraction took place between January 1930 and July 1932, before the introduction of the majority of protectionist measures, excepting limited American measures applied in the summer of 1930. It was the collapse of international liquidity that caused of the contraction of trade. = Trade liberalization = Tariffs up to the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act of 1930, were set by Congress after many months of testimony and negotiations. In 1934, the U.S. Congress, in a rare delegation of authority, passed the Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934, which authorized the executive branch to negotiate bilateral tariff reduction agreements with other countries. The prevailing view then was that trade liberalization may help stimulate economic growth. However, no one country was willing to liberalize unilaterally. Between 1934 and 1945, the executive branch negotiated over 32 bilateral trade liberalization agreements with other countries. The belief that low tariffs led to a more prosperous country are now the predominant belief with some exceptions. Multilateralism is embodied in the seven tariff reduction rounds that occurred between 1948 and 1994. In each of these \\"rounds\\", all General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) members came together to negotiate mutually agreeable trade liberalization packages and reciprocal tariff rates. In the Uruguay round in 1994, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established to help establish uniform tariff rates. Presently only about 30% of all import goods are subject to tariffs in the United States, the rest are on the free list. The \\"average\\" tariffs now charged by the United States are at a historic low. The list of negotiated tariffs are listed on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule as put out by the United States International Trade Commission.Harmonized Tariff Schedule Accessed 12 Jul 2011 = Post World War II = After the war the U.S. promoted the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established in 1947, to minimize tariffs and other restrictions, and to liberalize trade among all capitalist countries. In 1995 GATT became the World Trade Organization (WTO); with the collapse of Communism its open markets/low tariff ideology became dominant worldwide in the 1990s. American industry and labor prospered after World War II, but hard times set in after 1970. For the first time there was stiff competition from low-cost producers around the globe. Many rust belt industries faded or collapsed, especially the manufacture of steel, TV sets, shoes, toys, textiles and clothing. Toyota and Nissan threatened the giant domestic auto industry. In the late 1970s Detroit and the auto workers union combined to fight for protection. They obtained not high tariffs, but a voluntary restriction of imports from the Japanese government. Quotas were two-country diplomatic agreements that had the same protective effect as high tariffs, but did not invite retaliation from third countries. By limiting the number of Japanese automobiles that could be imported, quotas inadvertently helped Japanese companies push into larger, and more expensive market segments. The Japanese producers, limited by the number of cars they could export to America, opted to increase the value of their exports to maintain revenue growth. This action threatened the American producers' historical hold on the mid- and large-size car markets.John H. Barton, Judith L. Goldstein, Timothy E. Josling, and Richard H. Steinberg, The Evolution of the Trade Regime: Politics, Law, and Economics of the GATT and the WTO (2008) Under the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations, increasing numbers of Voluntary Export Restraint agreements were also secured with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and European countries to avert the application of trade barriers by the US. Products subjected to quotas included textiles, plywood, sewing machines, flatware, tuna, woodscrews, steel, steel and iron products, glass, footwear, and electronics. The chicken tax was a 1964 response by President Lyndon B. Johnson to tariffs placed by Germany (then West Germany) on importation of US chicken. Beginning in 1962, during the President Kennedy administration, the US accused Europe of unfairly restricting imports of American poultry at the request of West German chicken farmers. Diplomacy failed, and in January 1964, two months after taking office, President Johnson retaliated by imposing a 25 percent tax on all imported light trucks. This directly affected the German built Volkswagen vans. Officially it was explained that the light trucks tax would offset the dollar amount of imports of Volkswagen vans from West Germany with the lost American sales of chickens to Europe. But audio tapes from the Johnson White House reveal that in January 1964, President Johnson was attempting to convince United Auto Workers's president Walter Reuther, not to initiate a strike just prior the 1964 election and to support the president's civil rights platform. Reuther in turn wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen's increased shipments to the United States. = 1980s to present = China gained entry to the WTO as Most favoured nation in early 2000s. During the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations Republicans abandoned protectionist policies, and came out against quotas and in favor of the GATT/WTO policy of minimal economic barriers to global trade. Free trade with Canada came about as a result of the Canada‚ÄìU.S. Free Trade Agreement of 1987, which led in 1994 to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It was based on Reagan's plan to enlarge the scope of the market for American firms to include Canada and Mexico. President Bill Clinton, with strong Republican support in 1993, pushed NAFTA through Congress over the vehement objection of labor unions. Likewise, in 2000 Clinton worked with Republicans to give China entry into WTO and \\"most favored nation\\" trading status (i.e., the same low tariffs promised to any other WTO member). NAFTA and WTO advocates promoted an optimistic vision of the future, with prosperity to be based on intellectuals skills and managerial know-how more than on routine hand labor. They promised that free trade meant lower prices for consumers. Opposition to liberalized trade came increasingly from labor unions, who argued that this system also meant lower wages and fewer jobs for American workers who could not compete against wages of less than a dollar an hour. The shrinking size and diminished political clout of these unions repeatedly left them on the losing side. A large majority of observational studies have found that voters' economic hardships influence their support of protectionism. This is corroborated by 2016 United States presidential election, in which Donald Trump was broadly supported in the Rust Belt. However, experimental studies find that support for protectionism is not sufficiently, or even necessarily, related to an individual's economic circumstances, but instead is deeply rooted in domestic politics. Despite overall decreases in international tariffs, some tariffs have been more resistant to change. For example, due partially to tariff pressure from the European Common Agricultural Policy, US agricultural subsidies have seen little decrease over the past few decades, even in the face of recent pressure from the WTO during the latest Doha talks.  Support among American politicians  Opening trade to imports lowers the price from Pa to Pw and increases the quantity from Qa to Ct. This increases consumer surplus (the area under the demand curve but above price) by X+Z as consumers can purchase more goods at lower prices. However, it also reduces producer surplus (the area above the supply curve but below the price) by X, as domestic producers supply fewer goods at lower prices. Domestic producers will choose to produce at Qt, with the quantity gap between Qt and Ct filled by imports. This overall gain from free trade is area Z, although there are winners (consumers) and losers (domestic firms and their employees). Diagram showing effects of an import tariff, which hurts domestic consumers more than domestic producers are helped. Higher prices and lower quantities reduce consumer surplus (the area above price but under the demand curve) by areas A+B+C+D, while expanding producer surplus (the area below price but above the supply curve) by A and government revenue by C (the import quantity times the tariff price.) Areas B and D are dead-weight losses, surplus lost by consumers and overall. From 1871 to 1913, \\"the average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [and] gross national product (GNP) grew 4.3 percent annually, twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century,\\" notes Alfred Eckes Jr., chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan. In 1896, the GOP platform pledged to \\"renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman.\\" = George Washington = \\"I use no porter or cheese in my family, but such as is made in America,\\" the inaugural President George Washington wrote, boasting that these domestic products are \\"of an excellent quality.\\" One of the first acts of Congress Washington signed was a tariff among whose stated purpose was \\"the encouragement and protection of manufactures.\\" In his 1790 State of the Union Address, Washington justified his tariff policy for national security reasons: > A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a > uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest > require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them > independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies = Thomas Jefferson = As President Thomas Jefferson wrote in explaining why his views had evolved to favor more protectionist policies: \\"In so complicated a science as political economy, no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances, and for their contraries.\\" After the War of 1812, Jefferson's position began to resemble that of Washington, that some level of protection was necessary to secure the nation's political independence. He said: > experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our > independence as to our comfort: and if those who quote me as of a different > opinion will keep pace with me in purchasing nothing foreign where an > equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained, without regard to difference > of price = Henry Clay = In 1832, then United States Senator from Kentucky, Henry Clay said about his disdain for \\"free traders\\" that \\"it is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance. It is in effect, the British colonial system that we are invited to adopt; and, if their policy prevail, it will lead substantially to the re-colonization of these States, under the commercial dominion of Great Britain.\\" Clay said: > When gentlemen have succeeded in their design of an immediate or gradual > destruction of the American System, what is their substitute? Free trade! > Free trade! The call for free trade is as unavailing as the cry of a spoiled > child, in its nurse's arms, for the moon, or the stars that glitter in the > firmament of heaven. It never has existed; it never will exist. Trade > implies, at least two parties. To be free, it should be fair, equal and > reciprocal. Clay explained that \\"equal and reciprocal\\" free trade \\"never has existed; [and] it never will exist.\\" He warned against practicing \\"romantic trade philanthropy ... which invokes us to continue to purchase the produce of foreign industry, without regard to the state or prosperity of our own.\\" Clay made clear that he was \\"utterly and irreconcilably opposed\\" to trade which would \\"throw wide open our ports to foreign productions\\" without reciprocation. = Andrew Jackson = Henry Clay's longtime rival and political opponent, President Andrew Jackson, in explaining his support for a tariff, wrote: > We have been too long subject to the policy of the British merchants. It is > time we should become a little more Americanized, and, instead of feeding > the paupers and laborers of Europe, feed our own, or else, in a short time, > by continuing our present policy, we shall all be paupers ourselves. = James Monroe = In 1822, President James Monroe observed that \\"whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce,\\" the conditions necessary for its success‚Äîreciprocity and international peace‚Äî\\"has never occurred and can not be expected.\\" Monroe said, \\"strong reasons ... impose on us the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures.\\" =Abraham Lincoln= President Abraham Lincoln declared, \\"Give us a protective tariff and we will have the greatest nation on earth.\\" Lincoln warned that \\"the abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government ... must produce want and ruin among our people.\\" Lincoln similarly said that, \\"if a duty amount to full protection be levied upon an article\\" that could be produced domestically, \\"at no distant day, in consequence of such duty,\\" the domestic article \\"will be sold to our people cheaper than before.\\" Additionally, Lincoln argued that based on economies of scale, any temporary increase in costs resulting from a tariff would eventually decrease as the domestic manufacturer produced more. Lincoln did not see a tariff as a tax on low-income Americans because it would only burden the consumer according to the amount the consumer consumed. By the tariff system, the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods ... the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free. Lincoln argued that a tariff system was less intrusive than domestic taxation: The tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points, will require comparatively few officers in their collection; while by the direct tax system, the land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass and other green thing. = William McKinley = President William McKinley supported tariffs and rejected the \\"cheaper is better\\" argument: > Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave. > Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self- > development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. > [It is said] that protection is immoral. ...

Globalization and sociological effects in U.S. In The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy, Christopher Lasch analyzes the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites. In reference to The Revolt of the Masses (1929) of the Spanish philosopher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Christopher Lasch concludes: \\"In the past, it was the \\"revolt of the masses\\" that was seen as the threat to the social order .... Today, however, the main threat seems to come from those at the top of the social hierarchy and not from the masses.\\" According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e., those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through to globalization, which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations. Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of society tends to produce a class who see themselves as \\"world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies\\". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information - make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have \\"withdrawn from common life\\". Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis. The result of this split from the top of the scale is that no one has a likely solution to these inextricable problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. At the same time, \\"middle Americans, as they appear to the makers of educated opinion, are hopelessly shabby, unfashionable, and provincial, ill-informed about changes in taste or intellectual trends\\".  Public opinion on protectionism and free trade  Opinions on trade and protectionism have fluctuated since the early 2000s. Opinions recently have decided roughly of partisan lines. While 67% of Democrats believing free trade agreements are good for the United States, only 36% of Republicans agree. When asked if free trade has helped respondents specifically, the approval numbers for Democrats drop to 54%, however approval ratings among republicans remain relatively unchanged at 34%. The 2016 election marked the beginning of the trend of returning to protectionism, an ideology incorporated into Donald Trump's platform. During the Republican primary, Trump voters had a much more positive view of protectionism and \\"economic nationalism\\" than Cruz or Kasich voters. However, after the election there seems to have been a push-back against such sentiments, with an uptick in support for free trade agreements in both parties, with 72% of respondents saying international trade was an opportunity, not a threat. Scholars, such as Michael J. Hiscox, have argued that public opinion of international trade and protectionism is particularly malleable to political framing because of the complexity of the issue. Due to this complexity, the public is more likely to look to the elites in their own political parties to form their opinions. From 2005 to 2018, American favorability towards NAFTA increased at a relatively stable rate, with 48% of people believing the deal has been good for the United States in 2018 compared to only 38% in 2005.

The system consists of a primary bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, a faint secondary which has rarely been observed even professionally, and a distant, somewhat bright tertiary which requires telescopic equipment for observation. Components Diagram of Rho Geminorum and the four companions listed in the WDS The positions of the three stars in the Rho Geminorum system on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. As Rho Geminorum B does not have a known B-V or temperature, a line through its absolute magnitude is drawn instead. Rho Geminorum A is a bright star with a spectral type F0V, meaning that it is a main sequence that is over a thousand kelvins hotter, one-third more massive, two-thirds larger and five-and-a-half times more luminous than the Sun. With an apparent magnitude of 4.25, it is approximately the seventeenth- brightest star in the constellation of Gemini. Though there are some sources indicating that the star is a spectroscopic binary, including the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) and the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars, no orbit has been provided. The WDS lists four companions to Rho Geminorum. Of these, surprisingly little is known about the closest companion, the magnitude 12.5 Rho Geminorum B. The most recent measurement lists a separation of 3.4 arcseconds, corresponding to a separation perpendicular to the line of sight of approximately 85 AU. The spectral type listed in SIMBAD is M5, though this is without a source; Plotting the star's absolute magnitude on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (see left) indicates a B-V of 1.53, a value closer to that of an M3V star. Peculiarly, the five observations recorded in the WDS date between 1910 and 1935 and none have been made since; even in literature, more recent attempts to resolve Rho Geminorum B have been unsuccessful. The measurements listed in the WDS seem to be inconsistent with the star being in the background, so the reasons for the failure to observe Rho Geminorum B is unclear. The next-closest companion, the magnitude 11.59 WDS 07291+3147 C, had a much larger separation of 211.6 arcseconds in 1886. However, this separation increased by 10 arcseconds by 2001, indicating that it is a background star that is unrelated to Rho Geminorum. Correcting for Rho Geminorum A's proper motion, this star's proper motion is RA = -19 mas/yr and Dec = -55 mas/yr. This is a modestly large value, consistent with a distance of a few hundred light-years. WDS 07291+3147 C is itself listed as having a companion, the magnitude 13.20 WDS 07291+3147 D. Relative to WDS 07291+3147 C its separation has remained at about 100 arcseconds between 1909 and 2001, indicating similar proper motion. While this would indicate that the two stars are bound, at a large distance this separation would indicate a separation of at least several thousand AU and their mutual separation has not been entirely consistent (the position angle has increased from 267 to 270¬∞, and the separation has decreased from 104.1 to 102.3 arcseconds). It is therefore possible that the two background stars are bound, but it is not certain. The final companion in the WDS, the magnitude 7.86 WDS 07291+3147 E (Rho Geminorum C), has a larger still separation of 756 arcseconds, translating to a separation perpendicular to the line of sight of about 18600 AU. The position of this star relative to the primary has remained consistent over decades, indicating that it has a common proper motion and is therefore a wide tertiary component. The wide separation has also facilitated for observations without contamination from Rho Geminorum A, and as of such Rho Geminorum C has its own Gliese catalogue number (273.1) and Hipparcos catalogue number (36357). The Hipparcos parallax is consistent with that of the primary to 1œÉ, leading to a probability that they are bound of approximately 100%. The star is also known to be a BY Draconis variable with a period of 11.63 days, caused by varying brightness as starspots move across the stellar surface across its rotation period. While the derived age for Rho Geminorum A of 2.1 billion years is not excessively young, Rho Geminorum C is still very active: It has an S'HK of about 0.5, a value similar to that of the near-analogous Epsilon Eridani whose Log R'HK is -4.45. This is much higher than a \\"quiet\\" value of <-4.8, making Rho Geminorum C bizarrely active for a modestly old star. The Rho Geminorum system is an interesting look into a system architecture similar to the 40 Eridani system while the most massive component is on the main sequence, before becoming a white dwarf.

Life  As a younger son, Rupert was originally destined for a career in the clergy. Gerlach I abdicated in 1344, in favour of his sons, except he kept Sonnenberg Castle, where he lived. This castle was to be inherited by Kraft, Rupert's eldest brother. However, Kraft fell in battle while fighting on the French side in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. It was then decided that Rupert would inherit Sonnenberg. Rupert's half-brother from his father's first marriage ruled their father's possessions jointly until 1355, and then divided it: * Adolph I inherited Nassau-Wiesbaden-Idstein (this line died out in the male line in 1605) * John I inherited Nassau-Weilburg (this line died out in the male line in 1912) * Rupert later inherited Nassau- Sonnenberg. From 1355, Rupert was bailiff at Am√∂neburg Castle for his half- brother Gerlach, who was Archbishop of Mainz. In 1361, Gerlach I died and Rupert inherited Nassau-Sonnenberg. Gerlach's widow Irmengard retired to Liebenau monastery, near Worms, where she became a Dominican nun. In 1367, Rupert pledged some of his territory to his half-brother Adolph I, who immediately pledged it to back to Rupert and Anna (Ruper's wife) and Irmengard (Rupert's mother and Adolph's step-mother). The reasons for this remarkable maneuver are unclear. In 1369, Rupert started a feud against John I of Nassau- Dillenburg, about some fief John I held from Hesse. Rupert claimed these fiefs, and joined the Star Covenant, an alliance of knights against Landgrave Henry II of Hesse. In 1370, his half-brother Adolph I died. In 1371, his mother, Irmengard, died,Historischer Verein von Hessen: Archiv f√ºr hessische Geschichte und Altertumskunde, vol. 2, part 2-3, page 447, 1841 Online as did his half-brothers John I and Gerlach. From 1372 to 1374, Rupert fought another feud against John I of Nassau-Dillenburg. He managed to keep his Sonnenberg Castle intact, whereas the town of Nassau was so badly damaged during the fighting that it was uninhabitable for a while. Rupert forced John to hand over the town of Hadamar to Anna. They divided the territory. Twin towers of Greifenstein Castle In 1381, King Wenceslaus appointed Rupert governor of the Wetterau. This triggered a second feud against Nassau-Dillenburg, which lasted until 1382. In 1382, Rupert and the Counts of Solms-Burgsolms expanded Greifenstein Castle and added the characteristic twin towers. Also in 1382, yet another feud against Nassau-Dillenburg broke out, which lasted until 1385. After the feud he fought in the Hattstein War on the side of the cities in the Rhine/Wetterau region, against the high nobility in the area. Rupert died in 1390 and was buried in Kirchheimbolanden. As he had no children, Nassau- Sonnenberg was inherited by Philipp I of Nassau-Weilburg  Marriage  In 1362, Rupert married Anna (d. 1404), a daughter of John of Nassau-Hadamar and Elisabeth of Waldeck. The marriage remained childless. After Rupert's death, Anna married Count Diether VIII of Katzenelnbogen (d. 1402).

It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.20. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 26.08 mas, it is located 125 light years from the Sun. Sigma Geminorum is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, which means that the spectrum of only one of the components can be discerned. It is an RS Canum Venaticorum variable with a period of 19.6 days, matching the orbital period. The stellar luminosity shows indications of ellipsoidal variation, as the primary component is partly filling its Roche lobe due to gravitational interaction between the two stars. The primary component is an evolved K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K1 III. It has a relatively high rate of spin for a giant star, showing a projected rotational velocity of 26.2 km/s and a rotation period of 19.47 days. This rate is being maintained by the tidal interaction between the two stars. The surface of the primary has large star spots that are locked onto the face oriented toward the secondary component. These spots appear to migrate poleward at an average velocity of . The surface activity makes the star a bright X-ray emission source with a luminosity of .

In recent years, the Ghent plant has become the largest Volvo plant in terms of the number of cars produced. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish automaker, Volvo Personvagnar AB (Volvo Cars). Legally it is part of Volvo Car Belgium NV. Its activities comprise welding, painting and final assembly. The plant became the only car manufacturing plant in Flanders after Ford Genk closed at the end of 2014. The plant opened in 1965. It was the first European Volvo plant outside Sweden. The Ghent location was chosen because it was centrally positioned within the EEC and was supported by a good transport infrastructure. The first Volvo produced in Ghent was the company‚Äôs 120 Series (120/121/122, later 130), also known as Amazon. In September 2012 the plant was producing the Volvo C30, Volvo V40, Volvo S60 and Volvo XC60 models, of which the XC60 was the top seller, thanks in part to tax advantages available in certain key markets for the DRIVe version.

Range and Habitat Eurycantha calcarata is native to New Guinea, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Typical habitat includes warm humid rainforest where it is found in foliage and ground litter. Description Spike on the male femur The thorny devil color ranges from light brown to black and resembles bark or rotten wood. Both sexes are wingless and armored with spines on body and legs. Exhibiting the sexual dimorphism of many similar insects (particularly other phasmids as well as mantises), males are small and thinner, less than 9-10 cm long while females are typically 14 cm in length. The male has enlarged hind leg femurs with a curved spine or thorn on the underneath side, large enough to be used as a fish hook in New Guinea. Females (only) have a larger abdomen tipped with an ovipositor. Behavior 250px Thorny devils are nocturnal feeders and group together during the day to hide under bark and in trees hollows, providing protection from predators. Like other types of stick insects they use crypsis and catalepsy to evade predators. Reproduction Eurycantha calcarata typically reproduce through sexual reproduction and produce eggs that hatch 4.5-6.5 months later. When no males are present in the population, this stick insect exhibits parthenogenesis instead. Eggs are typically 8.2 mm and 4 mm wide, with a somewhat cylindrical shape. Egg color can vary from shades of brown to grey and surface texture is rough and shiny. Males actively fight for mating rights with females. The females have a tail like structure known as the ovipositor, which is used to lay eggs under soft soil. The eggs tend to resemble plant seeds covered by a hard shell.

She attributes the collapse in the diversity of bio-systems and environmental degradation to monoculturalism and the civilized ontology that explains existence in terms of anthropocentric utilitarian functions.

Education AbdelRahim received her A.B. from Bryn Mawr College and, upon graduation in 1993, received the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to pursue an anthropological project in Europe. She did graduate work in 1993-94 at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (√âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales) or l'EHESS and master studies in social sciences at Stockholm University where she later worked as Visiting Researcher at the department of social anthropology. She completed her Ph.D. at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, Department of Comparative Literature. Her dissertation entitled Order and the Literary Rendering of Chaos: Children's Literature as Knowledge, Culture, and Social Foundation, examines the effect of ontological premises on human self-knowledge (anthropology) and the repercussions of such knowledge on the anthropogenic destruction of the world's life systems and diversity. Thought AbdelRahim traces the root of all oppression to the ontological premises of domestication that define the raison d'√™tre of living and non- living beings in terms of consumption and co-existence in a hierarchy of food chain. Drawing on paleontological studies, ethology, and biological anthropology, she challenges the precepts in the narrative of anthropology that constructs the human as predator and consumer. This critique extends to civilized economic and socio-political cultures and their effect on the environment as well as on systems of education and parenting. Her examination of civilized and wild narratives is relevant to a variety of domains and disciplines, such as philosophy of science, evolutionary theory, anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, environmental economics, education, literary theory.

A historic district encompassing the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 29, 2011. The complex was sold by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston in 2004 in order to help pay for the liabilities related to the sex abuse scandal, payouts for the scandal so far is approximately $ 4,000,000,000 (4 billion) church wide. Description and history The Sacred Heart complex is located in South Lawrence, on the west side of South Broadway, the major north-south artery through the area. It covers about between Groton and Hawley Streets, occupying all but the western part of a complete city block. The complex includes five buildings: two schools (one Romanesque Revival built 1899, the other Colonial Revival built 1926), and a convent (1920), rectory (1924), and church (1935‚Äì36). The church was designed by Woonsocket, Rhode Island architect Walter F. Fontaine in association with Joseph G. Morissette, of Lawrence.Bridgemen's Magazine Feb. 1934: 99. The schools and rectory are built out of brick, while the convent is stuccoed on the exterior, and the church is an elaborate example of Gothic Revival architecture in multicolored ashlar granite. Between the 1899 school and the convent is a small grotto that is also part of the complex. In 2004 the Catholic church consolidated seven parishes in Lawrence down to three, and this complex was sold to Sagrado Corazon LLC. The schools and convent have been converted to residential use, while the church and rectory are leased to a sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholic Dominican order. The complex as of 2017 is a vibrant traditional Catholic community. Restoration of the Church and rectory is on-going and a new brick cloister garden area has recently been built.

It was the government seat of the Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. Today it is the administrative seat of the government of Middle Franconia. The Great Hall and the Orangerie in its garden serve as venues for the biennial music festival Bachwoche Ansbach.  History  The palace was developed from a medieval building. From 1398 to 1400 Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg, expanded a Stiftshof outside the city walls to a water castle. Structural remains are preserved in the northwest wing of the present building. George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, ordered the Swabian architect Blasius Berwart (his chief architect from 1563 to 1580) to build a palace. It was erected in Renaissance style from 1565 to 1575. A large hall was built from 1565 to 1575, now called the \\"Gothische Halle\\" (Gothic Hall) because of its rib vault. It now houses the largest collection of fayence and porcelain of the former \\"Ansbacher Manufaktur\\". A century later, the major construction was done by Gabriel de Gabrieli (1694‚Äì1716), by Karl Friedrich von Zocha (1719‚Äì1730), and by Leopold Retti (1731‚Äì1749). Between 1705 and 1738 the building was changed to its present form.  Architecture  Gabriel de Gabrieli created before 1709 the southeast wing with the main facade in a style similar to Viennese Baroque. The interior dates from 1734 to 1745 under architect Leopoldo Retti. Carlo Carlone created a fresco on the ceiling of the Festsaal (Festive hall). Meissen porcelain is shown in the Spiegelkabinett (Hall of Mirrors). The interior of the palace has a hall of mirrors with French rococo features; the great hall was provided with painted ceiling and the rooms were fitted with Ansbach porcelain tiles of 18th century vintage. It had a garden that was laid out in the 16th century and modified in the 18th century with an orangerie. The castle has richly furnished state rooms on the first floor. In 1791, Karl August von Hardenberg, Prussia's representative in Ansbach, added board rooms and a library. From 1806, once the Royal Bavarian Government of Rezatkreis started functioning in Ansbach, the castle's first floor rooms were converted into offices, while the rooms on other floors remained unchanged. Between 1962 and 1974, the last major renovations to the castle were completed. The Bavarian Administration of State-owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes is in charge of the buildings and the museum.  Orangery and garden  Garden A garden was first mentioned in the 16th century in the herbal accounts of Leonhart Fuchs. Between 1723 and 1750, it was designed as a Baroque garden. Severely damaged during World War II, it was reconstructed after the war, including an herb garden with many medicinal plants and a house to keep potted plants in winter. Chief architect Carl Friedrich von Zocha created an Orangerie as an architectural center of the gardens. It was begun in 1726, but seems to have been incomplete when Frederick the Great visited in September 1743. On 14 December 1833 Kaspar Hauser suffered a fatal stab wound in the backyard garden. At the site a small gothic pillar is engraved \\"HIC OCCULTUS OCCULTO OCCISUS EST\\" (Here a stranger was killed by an unknown person). Not far away, in 1825 a monument to the poet Johann Peter Uz was Ansbach (1720-1796) built with a bronze bust by Carl Alexander Heideloff. The inscription on the stele-like pedestal reads: \\"THE WISE, THE POET, THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND FROM HIS ADMIRERS\\". The Orangerie and its courtyard host the annual Rococo Festival, showing life in the court at the time of Margrave Carl Wilhelm Friedrich von Brandenburg-Ansbach.

It is faced in yellow Flemish brick, trimmed with cast stone, over a concrete block frame. The main entrance is in a slightly projecting bay that extends the full height of the building, topped by a triangular pediment and flanked by pilasters. The side ends of the building also have slightly projecting central bays, with round arch windows on the second floor and doorways topped by pedimented hoods with scrolled brackets. The school, like the one it replaced, was named for Daniel Saunders, a key figure in the founding of Lawrence and the town's first treasurer. This building was designed by local architect M. Joseph Morissette, who is known primarily for his ecclesiastical projects. It was one of three schools whose construction was authorized in June 1931, which were built for a combined cost of about $174,000. The Saunders School served the first through third grades for most of its life, but in its later years served only as a kindergarten facility. It was formally closed in 2006, and sold in 2009.

The mill building was constructed between 1906 and 1909 for the American Woolen Company, and was dubbed by some locals as the \\"eighth wonder of the world\\" due to its size. It is a six-story brick building that is long and high, and encompasses some of aisles. Its purpose when built was to perform the complete textile manufacturing cycle of worsted woolens, from raw material to finished fabric, under a single roof. The surviving mill elements include the main building and a portion of a storehouse. The storehouse is a seven-story brick building located just east of the main building, of which approximately half remains from its original construction. The two sections (of an original four) were demolished in 2009, along with a number of other structures in the complex, including sections of the main mill building. The main mill building as it now stands is divided into four parts, featuring Romanesque Revival styling executed in brick with granite and cast stone detailing. The first is an office section, which protrudes from the main body. Like the main part of the building it is six stories, but is topped by a clock tower. The other three sections were originally labelled D, E, and F, and extend eastward from the office. Section D is 33 window bays, E is 42, and F 45 window bays in length. There are three stairwell towers that interrupt the pier-and-spandrel construction of the length of the building on its south (street-facing) elevation. These stairhouses are where entry is gained to the premises, through doorways recessed under arches. The north facade, facing the river, is uniformly window bays, broken only by wrought iron fire escapes and a few bricked-up bays where the building was connected to the demolished A, B, and C sections via covered bridges over a railroad spur. The mill complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 2010. At the time of the listing, section D was being converted to residential housing.

He moved to Kazakhstan in 1969 where he studied mechanical engineering at the Kazakh National Agrarian University, where he graduated in 1973. After graduation, he was sent to work as chief engineer of the collective farm in Shymkent (known at the time as Chimkent). In 1975, he was elected First Secretary of the Tulkubas District Komsomol Committee, where he worked for four years. In the 7 years since he left that post, he served as the head local party/executive positions in Shymkent. In the Spring of 1990, he worked as a deputy to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR.

The band was founded in 1885.  Early years  A Salvation Army corps was opened in Hendon in 1882, and its band, consisting of eight members, was formed three years later. Nineteenth century Salvation Army bands were made up entirely of men, and there was no requirement for members to have any particular musical ability. The early bandsmen of Hendon Band were often farmhands or shopkeepers serving the small Hendon community. The role of the band was to assist in worship at the church, and to promote the existence of the newly founded corps through 'open air' services, held outside to attract new worshipers in the district. By 1914 the Hendon Band was of sufficient quality and strength to carry out weekend 'campaigns', visiting other Salvation Army corps in the United Kingdom, and it is recorded as having been in Gravesend, Kent, when the First World War was declared.  Development  The end of the First World War saw the arrival at Hendon Corps of demobilised soldier Fred H. Cobb. Cobb was appointed Bandmaster in the 1920s and the band began to develop its reputation for high- quality musical performance. Demand for the band increased and weekend campaigns in Boscombe, Plymouth and Exeter were undertaken. In 1936, it undertook its first radio broadcast on Radio Luxembourg. Towards the end of the 1930s an offshoot band, the Young People‚Äôs Band, was founded to encourage young members of the Hendon Salvation Army to develop their musical abilities. In 1950 Fred H. Cobb retired and Don Morrison was appointed Bandmaster. In 1952, the band undertook its first foreign tour in Denmark. Morrison continued in service as Bandmaster for a further five years until he was succeeded by Fred H. Cobb‚Äôs son, renowned cornet soloist of the Salvation Army's International Staff Band and H. M. Band of the Welsh Guards, Roland Cobb. Under his leadership the band undertook its 1964 tour of the Netherlands, and its 1976 tour of Germany, Switzerland and - again - the Netherlands. In 1978, Hendon Band played the Queen Elizabeth Hall, on London's Southbank, for the first time.  Maturity  1979 saw Roland Cobb‚Äôs retirement as bandmaster. The band was led for a short period by Paul Ruby before Roland Cobb's eldest son, Dr Stephen Cobb (now also bandmaster of the International Staff Band), was appointed as his long-term successor, and under him the band's annual concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall entitled Hendon Highlights was established in 1985. In 1988, the band toured Canada and the U.S. for the first time, playing in Toronto, Vancouver, Colorado, San Diego and the length of the West Coast, at venues such as the Hollywood Bowl and Disneyworld. In 1993, the band returned to America, touring Washington D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, through the Appalachians, to the southern states of Georgia, Alabama and Florida. In 1996, a third visit was completed in which the band played concerts in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago, St. Louis and Detroit. In the late 1990s, the band appointed its first female members. In June 2000, Hendon Band took part in an inter-denominational service, marching at the head of the Christian clergy and congregations parading from Westminster Cathedral along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square, and culminating in a further march up The Mall to Buckingham Palace for the performance of a short concert. During the same month, the band represented the Salvation Army's United Kingdom Territory at the International Millennial Congress at Philips Arena, Atlanta, Georgia. The band also travelled to North Carolina to perform with the Asheville Symphony Chorus, and headlined a programme entitled Hendon Highlights USA at Atlanta‚Äôs Symphony Hall. In 2002, the band toured Switzerland, and in March 2005, it played a special concert at the Royal Festival Hall, London, to celebrate 21 years of its flagship annual concert, 'Hendon Highlights', with special guests the King's Singers, and established an annual Christmas concert 'A Portrait of Christmas', with special guest Simone Rebello, percussionist. It also toured the West Coast of the U.S. This was followed in 2007 with a tour of Denmark and Sweden, and a 2008 tour of Finland. Having served as its bandmaster for 29 years, Stephen Cobb relinquished his role as leader of the band in 2009 and was succeeded by David Rudd. Stephen Cobb returned as the band's conductor in 2012. More recently, the band has been noted for its principal cornetist, Philip Cobb, the youngest son of conductor Stephen Cobb, who was appointed principal trumpet of the London Symphony Orchestra, the youngest musician ever to hold this position. Although the band includes other professional musicians, it still remains an amateur group and its members are mainly students, teachers, businessmen, and civil servants, and other professionals.  Mission  The Hendon Band of the Salvation Army exists to promote the Salvation Army's Christian message, of 'heart to God and hand to man', in Hendon and its immediate area. The band's principal function is to accompany worship at Hendon Salvation Army, London, but over the years, its reputation for high-quality brass band music has led it to be invited to play all over the world, and thus it has taken its message further than many Salvation Army bands are able to.

Taxonomy  This species was originally described by German malacologist Heinrich Carl K√ºster. Although text description was in 1863 and figure description in 1862, the year 1862 prevails (according to the article 12.2.7 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature) because the name was already correctly cited in the figure legends of the 1862 plate. The specific name schirazensis is based on the name of the Iranian city Shiraz, which is the type locality for this species. Morphological, anatomical and phylogenetic analyses performed by Bargues et al. (2011) confirmed that this species belong to the Galba/Fossaria group. According to the same study, Galba schirazensis was previously an overlooked cryptic species, which had generally been confused with the very similar species Galba truncatula. Distribution According to the 2012 IUCN Red List, the native distribution of Galba schirazensis includes: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran and Russian Federation. The distribution of this species includes: * Fars Province and Gilan Province in IranGl√∂er P. & Pe≈°iƒá V.

Description Drawings of the shell of Galba schirazensis from its original description by Heinrich Carl K√ºster: { apertural view abapertural view } The shell is brownish to reddish light brown, thin-walled, elongated conical, usually with four regular convex whorls and up to 5.5 whorls in the longer specimens. The whorls are somewhat inflated, slightly shouldered, with silky and longitudinally striated surface and separated by a deep, well-marked suture, increasing rather slowly in diameter. The columella is straight, unfolded, and the umbilicus is open. The last or body whorl is almost ¬æ times as high as the shell height, presenting a slight twisting trend along its basal part visible in the biggest shells when viewed dorsally, and which is due to the enlargement of the basal lip of the peristome (in the way of Pseudosuccinea columella). The spire is pointed. The aperture is elongatedly oval, slightly oblique, mid-sized and wider at the base. The thin peristome is patent throughout, the umbilicus is partially covered by a widened columellar lip. The shell shows a tendency to be approximately one and a half to two times as long as it is wide, and its aperture tends to be slightly less than half as long as the shell. The width of the shell is 1.39-4.31 mm. The height of the shell is 2.41-8.06 mm. The width of the aperture is 0.77-2.66 mm. The height of the aperture is 1.16-4.12 mm. The following three characteristics of shell may be useful in species identification: The maximum height of the shell is 8.06 mm. Whorls are regularly convex. The columella is straight. { apertural view abapertural view umbilical view } The cephalopedeal mass is pale greyish. The eyes are black and relatively big in size. Tentacles are elongate, slender, pyramidal, with a narrow base. The mantle roof is dark, from dark brown to blackish throughout, with small unpigmented white-greyish round spots including several tiny circles at the beginning of the border of the pulmonary region and a few scattered further away in between the initial large round spots. The border of the mantle is light grey. The black pigmentation of the hypopeplear region of the mantle roof gave a dark appearance to the shell of living specimens by transparency. This dark appearance did not depend on the characteristics of the natural habitat, as it was maintained across the different laboratory-reared snail generations (quite the opposite of what happens with several darkish populations of other lymnaeid species under experimental conditions). The following external characteristics of shell may be useful in species identification: Tentacles are elongate, slender and with a narrow base. Eyes are big. the color of mantle roof varies from dark brown to blackish throughout, with unpigmented white-greyish round spots, giving a dark appearance to the shell by transparency. The following internal characteristics of shell may be useful in species identification: The first bilateral teeth are mostly bicuspid in radula. The praeputium/penis sheath length ratio is 1.20-2.23 mm (mean 1.60 mm). Two species that have a similar morphology: Galba truncatula and Galba neotropica. Galba schirazensis is genetically distant but phenotypically very close to Galba truncatula and it has always been confused with Galba truncatula. Although several phenotypic characteristics may a priori be helpful for a preliminary specimen classification, a definitive classification of a specimen can only be obtained by the sequencing of at least one of the molecular markers used: ribosomal DNA markers ITS-2 and ITS-1; mitochondrial DNA markers: 16S and cox1.  Ecology and transmission of diseases  Galba schirazensis is often amphibious and there is a terrestrial trend. They are sometimes anthropophilous. Mixed populations of Galba truncatula and Galba schirazensis have already been described in the field. Self-fertilization has been verified to be the normal fertilisation process in Galba schirazensis. They are hatching from eggs. The shape of egg cluster is kidney- to banana- like, the more curved, elongated and narrow the more numerous are the eggs inside. There are around 6-14 eggs in cluster. Researchers believed that, unlike the similar species Galba truncatula, Galba schirazensis did not transfer Fasciola hepatica (i.e. was not able to transmit fascioliasis). However, results published in 2017 found that Galba schirazensis was harbouring rediae of Fasciola hepatica in Ecuador and could be an intermediate host.  Human use  This hitherto overlooked species has been distorting results of fasciolid specificity/susceptibility analyses as well as the geographical distribution of the disease. Galba schirazensis can be used as a useful biomarker of foreign livestock introduction. Galba schirazensis offers an outstanding laboratory model for studies on genomics and proteomics about susceptibility/resistance in Fasciola hepatica/lymnaeid interaction.

Located in the Altstadt (old town) of Ansbach, St. Gumbertus, now a Lutheran church, was originally the church of a monastery that was founded by St. Gumbert around 750. Today it serves as a venue for concerts of the music festival Bachwoche Ansbach. The church contains the oldest structures in Ansbach and is considered Ansbach's city symbol. History Gumbert, who was later proclaimed a saint, around 750 founded a monastery dedicated to Mary, following the Benedictine Rule. In the 11th century it was converted to a Chorherrenstift or collegiate church. George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, followed the Reformation in 1528; under the principle Cuius regio, eius religio the monastery was dissolved in 1563. One of the treasures of the monastery was the Gumbertus Bible, written in Regensburg or Salzburg in the late 12th century. In 1195 it was purchased by the monastery; it is now MS. 1 in Erlangen University Library.Gumbertus Bible; Universit√§ts-Bibliothek Erlangen-N√ºrnberg Interior The St. Gumbertuskirche combines changing architectural styles. The oldest constructions in Ansbach are found in the crypt (around 1040), the pantheon of the Margraves of Ansbach and the only surviving parts of the original church. The Georgskapelle (St. George's Chapel) dates to the 14th century. The nave was originally Romanesque, the choir Gothic. The choir was transformed in the 16th century to a chapel Schwanenritterkapelle (Swan Knights Chapel), housing \\"elaborate epitaphs and death shields of members of the Order of the Swan, a lay foundation of Margrave Albrecht Achilles.\\" The whole building was changed in 1738 to a Repr√§sentationskirchenbau (representative church) by Charles William Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, under architect Leopold Retty. The nave was remodelled into a preaching hall in a restrained palette of gray and cream, built to cater to the Lutheran concentration on preaching, without the embellishments of side altars. The marble altar and the pulpit are main attractions of the church. After the dissolution of the Margraviate in 1791, the former court church became a Lutheran parish church, which now serves three districts in the eastern half of the city with about 6,000 church members. The church is a venue for church events and for concerts of the Bachwoche Ansbach, local groups and the Windsbacher Knabenchor.  Organ  Wiegleb organ The organ at St. Gumbertus (III 47) was built from 1736 to 1739 by Johann Christoph Wiegleb; the original choir had 47 different sounds, was the largest and most prestigious organ in the region of Franconia. It was rebuilt in 1884 by Georg Friedrich Steinmeyer of the firm Steinmeyer in romantic style, utilising materials of the older organ, praised by Albert Schweitzer, and again by the same firm in 1961 in neo-Baroque style. A controversy revolved around the issue as to whether the organ should be retained or restored to the original Wiegleb design. In 2004, the church council resolved to get the historic organ restored. The restoration work was carried out by Orgelmakerij Reil (Heerde, Netherlands) at a cost of euro 1.5 million euro, with funds raised from private donations and the association \\"Friends of the Ansbach Bach Week\\"). It was recommissioned on 17 June 2007 during the Bach week.

In a career that lasted from July 1885 to September 1886 the filly ran fifteen times and won eight races at distances ranging from five furlongs to one and three quarter miles. As a two-year-old in 1885, Miss Jummy won three times from seven starts, but when tried in the highest class she was unplaced behind the future Triple Crown winner Ormonde in the Dewhurst Stakes. In 1886, Miss Jummy was unbeaten when racing against her own age and sex, winning five races including the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom, the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood and the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster. She was unsuccessful in open competition, finishing unplaced in the Grand Prix de Paris and the Eclipse Stakes. At the end of 1886 she was retired to stud where her record was disappointing. Background Miss Jummy was a bay filly with a white star bred by her owner the 12th Duke of Hamilton. She was sired by Petrarch, a horse which won the 2000 Guineas and the St Leger Stakes in 1876. At stud Petrarch was particularly successful as a sire of fillies: his other daughters included Busybody (1000 Guineas and Oaks) and Throstle (St Leger). Her dam, Lady Portland, was not a successful racehorse but was descended from Alice Hawthorn, who won fifty-two races and became an influential broodmare. The Duke of Hamilton named his filly in honour of his friend, the Duke of Portland, who was known to his friends by the nickname Jumbo or Jummy. The filly was trained at Lordship Farm in Newmarket, Suffolk by Richard Marsh and was ridden to her most important victories races by John Watts. Racing career =1885: two-year-old season= The Duke of Hamilton, Miss Jummy's owner. At Goodwood on 28 July, Miss Jummy made her first appearance in the Richmond Stakes. She started a 20/1 outsider and was never in contention before finishing sixth of the seven runners behind Sunrise. Miss Jummy ran twice at the first October meeting at Newmarket. She won the ¬£900 Buckenham Stakes from three opponents including Argo Navis to record her first win, and returned later in the week to beat The Cob in the ¬£1100 Rutland Stakes. On the opening day of the second October meeting, Miss Jummy ran in the ¬£897 Clearwell Stakes. Carrying the top weight of 125 pounds, she started at odds of 100/15 in a field consisting of six colts and two fillies. Miss Jummy took the lead in the final quarter mile and held off a late challenge from Martinet to win \\"cleverly\\" by three quarters of a length. Three days later she reappeared in the Great Challenge Stakes, a weight-for-age race over six furlongs. She carried 97 pounds and Watts was replaced by a lightweight jockey. The filly became agitated before the start, and after being among the early leaders, she dropped back to finish fifth of the seven runners behind Modwena. Two weeks later, Miss Jummy returned to Newmarket for the Houghton meeting and started second favourite behind the unbeaten colt Ormonde in the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes. She reached third place two furlongs from the finish but faded into sixth as Ormonde won easily by four lengths. On her final race of the season she won a Post Sweepstakes later that week, but was disqualified when she found to be carrying an incorrect weight. =1886: three-year-old season= Spring Miss Jummy began her three-year-old season in The Riddlesworth over the Ditch Mile course at the Newmarket Craven meeting in mid-April. She led from the start and won by half a length from her only opponent, a colt named Oberon. On 30 April, Miss Jummy started at odds of 3/1 for in the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. The field of nine included her former opponents Modwena (the 2/1 favourite), Sunrise and Argo Navis. When the race began the outsider Sagitta rushed to the front and opened up a lead of twenty lengths before tiring rapidly after half distance. As Sagitta dropped back, Watts took over the lead on Miss Jummy just ahead of Cataract, Argo Navis and Modwena. Miss Jummy increased her advantage in the final furlong and comfortably held the challenge of Argo Navis to win the ¬£3,250 prize by one and a half lengths; Jewel Song finished a head in front of Modwena to take third place. Summer John Watts, Miss Jummy's regular jockey. Four weeks later, Miss Jummy moved up in distance for the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. She was made the even money favourite in a field of twelve fillies, with her most serious challenger appearing to be Braw Lass, a filly who had finished a close second to Minting in the Middle Park Plate. Watts restrained the favourite in the early stages as Storm Light set a very slow pace. Miss Jummy turned into the straight in fourth place before overtaking Storm Light approaching the final furlong. She won the race easily by half a length from Argo Navis, who finished strongly after being badly hampered, with Braw Lass a full length behind in third. The prize for the winner was ¬£3,250. Nine days after her victory at Epsom, Miss Jummy was sent to France to contest the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse. In a field of six colts and two fillies for the ¬£4,000 prize, she started 7/2 second favourite behind Minting. She raced in second place for much of the 3000 metre distance, but tired on the heavy ground and was virtually pulled up by Watts in the closing stages. On her next appearance, Miss Jummy took part in the inaugural running of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park, which, with a first prize of ¬£10,000, was the most valuable race ever run in Britain. The race was run over ten furlongs at weight-for-age, although the winners of certain major races, including the Oaks, had to carry a seven pound penalty. She started a 40/1 outsider and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind the six-year-old Bendigo. Miss Jummy was sent to Goodwood in late July and ran twice: after running second to the Duke of Westminster's colt Whitefriar in the Gratwicke Stakes she won the ten furlong Nassau Stakes from three opponents at odds of 11/4, beating Argo Navis into second place for the fourth time. Autumn On 16 September, Miss Jummy started the 6/4 favourite for the Park Hill Stakes over the St Leger course and distance in which she was set to concede six pounds to her principal opponents Argo Navis and the Yorkshire Oaks winner Philosophy. Miss Jummy tracked the leaders before taking the lead approaching the final furlong. She was immediately challenged by Argo Navis and the two fillies raced together throughout the final furlong with Miss Jummy prevailing by a neck over her old rival. The winning time of 3:20.5 was almost a second faster than that recorded by Ormonde, carrying five pounds less, in the St Leger two days earlier. Stud career Miss Jummy was retired to stud, but had little success as a broodmare. Miss Jummy produced two filly foals- Miss Jumbo by Mask and Nobody's Child by Trappist- before her death at age six in 1889.

It presents itself as a hastily written essay/memoir/confession. The character Dom is sometimes described as a fictionalized Norman Mailer. The title \\"Ancient History\\" refers to classical Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Persian history, which Cy, the narrator, is something of an amateur expert in. It was the name for the course Cy took at Poly Prep. But it also the narrator's frequent dismissive phrase regarding his own obsessive retelling of trivial details from his own personal past. The word \\"paraphase\\", used in the subtitle and a few times in the text, is Cy's neologism, never actually defined. In March 2014, Dzanc Books published a paperback edition, with an introduction by Jonathan Lethem. Plot summary The setting is one evening, circa 1970. Cy had intended to talk to the famous social scientist/writer/activist Dom (or Don, Cy isn't sure) who lives in the same Manhattan building as Cy. But upon arriving on Dom's floor of the building, he finds the police are removing Dom's body, reportedly a suicide. Cy enters the apartment, locks the door but leaves the chain off, and proceeds to commit in writing, with Dom's own paper and pen, all the things Cy had intended to say to Dom, and then some. The resulting manuscript is the sole content of the novel. Cy tells the rambling story of his own life, his friendships since childhood with Al (on vacations in the country) and with Bob (his neighbor in Brooklyn Heights), his marriage to Ev and their daughter Emma, her ex-husband Doug, later a suicide which Cy feels partly responsible for, his stepson Ted. He makes a major issue of the fact that Al and Bob have never met by his own connivance, but are about to. He confesses to stealing Dom's mail. He also writes a great deal about Dom's life and theories, and expresses concern that Dom's suicide might be Cy's fault. Halfway through, the narrative breaks off mid-sentence. As we learn in the resumption of Cy's writing, Dom's son-in-law and a police officer entered the apartment and looked around. Cy was hidden behind a curtain, but he had left the just-written manuscript on Dom's desk. The officer wasn't sure if he should treat the apartment as a crime scene: he was suspicious of the son-in-law's removal of Cy's manuscript, but let it go. When the two leave, Cy sees that his writing was taken. Cy then resumes his writing, even more frantic. Character summary ;Cy:Presumably short for Cyrus,Cy wonders what his mother would think of Cyrus the Great's morbid childhood had she ever have had to name a second child. also called C.C. Born around 1930, an only child, an early gift of a Junior Corona leads to Cy taking an interest in writing. Cy attended Poly. Cy has a strong interest in ancient history, and refers learnedly to Cyrus the Great, Harpagus, Herodotus, Hypatia and Lucretius. He makes erudite puns, like Forgetorix the First and Utmosis the Last. He has followed Dom's career, partly with a press pass, moving into Dom's building six months before Dom's death, and was introduced to Dom by a mutual acquaintance one week before Dom's death. He is married to Ev, whose son by a previous marriage is Ted. Cy and Ev have a daughter Emma, just learning to talk. ;Dom:The great man, a New York Jewish liberal, writer, and activist. He led a great demonstration in 1968, the Anti-Abstraction March, which culminated with Dom falling--possibly pushed, not that Dom admits to caring--out of a ninth floor window and surviving unhurt. He is divorced from Dorothy, called \\"Dot\\". Their children are Richard and Lila. Lila is married to an unnamed psychiatrist, frequently referred to by his nationality, Hungarian.Ted was treated for a while by a Hungarian psychiatrist, but Cy gives no indication if this is the same person. ;Al:Cy's country friend, from near Heatsburg, a fictional town in Massachusetts, the far end of Red Sox territory. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of seemingly everything. He served in the Coast Guard from 1951-53\\\\. His sister Gail and Cy were attracted to each other as young teenagers. He has a cat named Epaminondas. ;Bob:Cy's Brooklyn Heights childhood neighbor and friend. He married Perpetua \\"Petty\\" Belle Pound, a mutual childhood friend and neighbor of Bob and Cy. Their children are Robert and John B. He likes Beckett's plays, in contrast to Cy, who likes Beckett's novels. Their Beckett discussion is the first time Cy's name is mentioned. ;Doug:Ev's ex-husband, and father of Ted, he committed suicide the day after meeting Cy. The description of the meeting itself, partway though the second half, is the second time Cy mentions his own name. ;Fred Eagle:A book-seller, he tries to interest Cy and some friends in Charles Dickens, especially Great Expectations, the famed eleventh edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and Charles Kingsley Hypatia.Not mentioned in the novel is the fact that the main antagonist in Hypatia is another \\"Cy\\": Cyril of Alexandria. He later recounts a dream, where he saw his wife reading Hypatia, but she became Hypatia, and time ancient and present mixed together. What is \\"paraphase\\"? McElroy has given the following explanation: Cy's first use of the word occurs on page 139: NYT review with misspelled subtitle. The \\"phrases\\" here refer to Cy's actual writing compared and contrasted with the reality they are describing, three phrases to Cy's personal \\"ancient history\\", and two phrases regarding Cy's current situation (although the \\"thirty word\\" count seems to be off by one). A reader of Beckett's novels, Cy has adopted a Malone-like style, including comments on his own handwriting. Not all readers have noticed the unusual spelling. For example, The New York Times review by Lehmann-Haupt gives the subtitle as \\"Paraphase\\", and similarly misspells the word in the above quotation from the novel.Of course, this may be the fault of a copy-editor. Themes and style The novel is highly repetitious (one analysis calls it \\"a verbal excess\\"), with Cy amplifying the various back stories, in ways which emphasize, and sometimes are, the themes. Cy himself is a reader of Samuel Beckett's novels. Because Cy has too much memory (Cy wishes he \\"could be Forgetorix the First,a learned \\"ancient history\\" pun and leave behind ... a mass of Past\\"), Cy is forced into florid repetitiveness. The \\"connect-the-dot\\" puzzles that Al's father did are echoed in the characters with names barely more than A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., and which the reader is forced to \\"connect\\". Cy has a taste for \\"para-\\" as a prefix, including several uses of the subtitle neologism \\"paraphase\\". Cy muses that Dom's \\"site\\", now that he is occupying it, has become a \\"para-site\\". \\"Parabola\\" is used frequently. It first appears attached to two diagrams from Ted's geometry lessons, one of a parabola showing the curve as the locus of points equidistant from a focus and a directrix, the other as a cross-section of a cone. Later uses, along with \\"equidistant\\" and \\"directrix\\", are vague and metaphorical. Cy has a theory concerning what he calls the Vectoral Muscle, located in the brain near the pons Varolii. It is a gift that usually only children might have, allowing them to see the geometric relations between everything. But it can go wrong, leading to Vectoral Dystrophy. Reception In the two reviews from the NYT cited below, note that the first review has the incorrect \\"Paraphrase\\" in the subtitle, while the second review has the correct \\"Paraphase\\".

Made of marble and bronze, the fountain was commissioned in 1565 and designed by Baccio Bandinelli. It is the work of the sculptor Bartolomeo Ammannati with some elements created by collaborators. For example, the bronze sea-horses are the work of Giovanni da Bologna, often called Giambologna. Creation In 1559, Cosimo I de' Medici launched a competition to design a fountain at a time when a new aqueduct was also being built, the first to bring running water to the city. The plan was for a statue of Neptune as the primary element, in a chariot drawn by sea-horses, symbolizing Florence's command of the Mediterranean. Initially, Baccio Bandinelli was the sculptor chosen but he died before work began. Sculptor Ammannati was hired to take over and completed the work with assistants and collaborators. The face of Neptune is said to resemble that of the Grand Duke Cosimo. The 4.2 meter tall Neptune figure, made of Apuan marble, was completed in 1565 in time for the wedding of Francesco de' Medici I to grand duchess Johanna of Austria. Due to a myriad of delays in sourcing supplies for the fountain‚Äôs completion, Ammannati was forced to come up with a temporary solution for the arrival of Johanna of Austria. Through the use of stucco and paint, Ammannati was able to create the illusion of a finished product. Florentines were not impressed and called the statue \\"Il Biancone\\" (\\"the white giant\\"). The work on the basin and other aspects of the fountain required nearly ten years. Ammannati and his collaborators added around the perimeter of the basin in a mannerist style, reclining, bronze river gods, laughing satyrs and marble sea-horses emerging from the water. The pedestal on which the statue stands is in the center of the octagonal fountain. It is decorated with the mythical figures of Scylla and Charybdis. The final work was completed in December 1574. The statue on display today is a copy made in the 1800s when the original was moved to the National Museum. History of vandalism vandals on the night of August 4, 2005 The fountain has suffered a great deal of damage during the centuries. It was used as a washbasin for inkpots and laundry at the end of the 16th century. It was vandalized on January 25, 1580. A satyr was stolen during the carnival in 1830. It was damaged again by the Bourbon bombardments of 1848. Subsequently, it has been the object of several restorations and substitutions. On August 4, 2005, the statue was the target of three vandals who climbed it, damaging one of the hands and the trident of Neptune. The act was recorded by security cameras. The statue was restored by 2007. Since then, security on the fountain has been taken very seriously. In late 2007, the statue was the target of attempted vandalism by four teens. The security cameras and nearby police ensured that no damage came to the fountain again and the four were arrested. Although the damage was repaired, the fountain underwent a general restoration that started in September 2016 and concluded in 2018; during this time, the fountain was surrounded by a protective cage and scaffolding. Similar statuary As would be expected, the Sea-God, Neptune is a frequent theme for fountains, and over a dozen Fountains of Neptune exist. In Florence, there is another fountain of Neptune is found in the Boboli Gardens, behind the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Giambologna sculpted a similar statue for the similar fountain in Bologna in the 1560s. Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli created a nearly contemporary fountain in Messina, Sicily. The Fountain of Neptune, Rome (Neptune fighting with an octopus) was completed in 1878 when the statue was added by Antonio della Bitta and sea creatures by Gregorio Zappal√† for the theme \\"Nereids with cupids and walruses\\". The original basin was designed in 1574, by Giacomo Della Porta, and built at about that time.

The house was designed as a double house, although the reasons why Fenno wanted such a house are not known. He sold the property to his son in 1814 after moving to Columbia, Maine, and the two units were sold out of the family in 1822 and 1832. Each half of the house then went through a succession of owners. The most notable of these was John Bertram, a wealthy merchant, railroad investor and philanthropist, who purchased the northern unit in 1879, and immediately arranged for its eventual donation to the Woman's Friend Society on behalf of his daughter, Jennie Emmerton. The society acquired full ownership of that unit in 1884, and purchased the southern unit in 1894.

The city acquired the property where the school sits from Augusta B. Trask and Eliza E. Manning. The contractor for the project, John D. Jeffers of Peabody, submitted the lowest bid of $29,135.80. Ground was broken for the school in May 1911 and work on the building commenced the following month. The building was situated 150 feet from Lynn Street and surrounded by a pipe railing. The city's oldest existing school was designed by architect Edwin Earp & Son of Lynn,School Board Journal June 1911: 45. Milwaukee. who later sued the town for $3000 for fees in connection with the drawing of plans for the school. The town expended $33,000 for the building committee and for architect's fees. It took about three months to complete the building that was finished on September 20, 1911. The school's one hundred pupils then occupied three rooms. The building was named for Samuel Brown, who died during the American Civil War in the Battle of Antietam. The original school building was enlarged in 1920 to a ten-room building. Four more rooms were added in 1950. Both of these additions were designed by John M. Gray, who served as the town's de facto municipal architect.

The portion of the park nearest Atlantic Avenue is flat, and has developed athletic facilities, including a paved basketball court, and a baseball diamond whose outfield area is large enough for use as a football or soccer field. Behind the diamond is the Roundy Grandstand, and tennis courts and a playground extend north, behind the adjacent Our Lady Star of the Sea church complex. Behind the grandstand and tennis courts the land rises into a wooded area, through which trails circulate and lead toward the shore. Views of Ladys Cove and Marblehead Neck are only obtained from the easternmost part of the park, the higher rocky outcrops having been obscured by trees. History Marblehead's first three parks, Crocker Park, Bailey's Headland, and Fort Sewall, were established between 1886 and 1890. The first land for Seaside Park was acquired in 1895, with the plan to develop it as a site for athletic activities. The inland portion, eventually increased by further acquisitions, was levelled and seeded, and improvements began to be added in the 1910s. The grandstand was built in 1916, in part at the request of a local semi-pro baseball league. The park was visited by President Calvin Coolidge when he summered at Marblehead in 1925. The first tennis courts were added in the 1930s, as was an ice skating rink, whose space has since taken over by more tennis courts. The grandstand underwent a major restoration in 1990.

CPPCDV01.pngCp2V2(CO)5 featuring a pair of semi-bridging CO ligands. (Œ∑5-C5H5) piano stool compounds Half sandwich complexes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands are common. Well studied examples include (Œ∑5-C5H5)V(CO)4, (Œ∑5-C5H5)Cr(CO)3H, (Œ∑5-CH3C5H4)Mn(CO)3, (Œ∑5-C5H5)Cr(CO)3H, [(Œ∑5-C5H5)Fe(CO)3]+, (Œ∑5-C5H5)V(CO)4I, and (Œ∑5-C5H5)Ru(NCMe). (Œ∑5-C5H5)Co(CO)2 is a two-legged piano stool complex. Bulky cyclopentadienyl ligands such as 1,2,4-C5H2(tert-Bu)3‚àí form unusual half-sandwich complexes. (Œ∑6-C6H6) piano stool compounds right In organometallic chemistry, (Œ∑6-C6H6) piano stool compounds are half-sandwich compounds with (Œ∑6-C6H6)ML3 structure (M = Cr, Mo, W, Mn(I), Re(I) and L = typically CO). (Œ∑6-C6H6) piano stool complexes are stable 18-electron coordination compounds with a variety of chemical and material applications. Early studies on (Œ∑6-C6H6)Cr(CO)3 were carried out by Natta, Ercoli and Calderazzo, and Fischer and Ofele, and the crystal structure was determined by Corradini and Allegra in 1959. The X-ray data indicate that the plane of the benzene ring is nearly parallel to the plane defined by the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl ligands, and so the structure resembles a benzene seat mounted on three carbonyl legs tethered by the metal atom. =Cr and Mn(I) (Œ∑6-C6H6) piano stool complexes= Piano stool complexes of the type (Œ∑6-C6H6)M(CO)3 are typically synthesized by heating the appropriate metal carbonyl compound with benzene. Alternately, the same compounds can be obtained by carbonylation of the bis(arene) sandwich compounds, such as (Œ∑6-C6H6)2M compound with the metal carbonyl compound. This second approach may be more appropriate for arene ligands containing thermally fragile substituents. :360px Reactivity of (Œ∑6-C6H6)Cr(CO)3 The benzene ligand in (Œ∑6-C6H6)Cr(CO)3Mi is prone to deprotonation. For example, Organolithium compounds form adducts featuring cyclohexadienyl ligands. Subsequent oxidation of the complex results in the release of a substituted benzene. Oxidation of the chromium atom by I2 and other iodine reagents has been shown to promote exchange of arene ligands, but the intermediate chromium iodide species has not been characterized. :400px (Œ∑6-C6H6)Cr(CO)3 complexes exhibit \\"cine\\" and \\"tele\\" nucleophilic aromatic addition. Processes of this type involve reaction of (Œ∑6-C6H6)Cr(CO)3 with an alkyl lithium reagent. Subsequent treatment with an acid results in the addition of a nucleophile to the benzene ring at a site ortho (\\"cine\\"), meta or para (\\"tele\\") to the ipso carbon (see Arene substitution patterns). :350px Reflecting its increased acidity, the benzene ligand can be lithiated with n-butyllithium. The resulting organolithium compound serves as a nucleophile in various reactions, for example, with trimethylsilyl chloride: :400px (Œ∑6-C6H6)Cr(CO)3 is a useful catalyst for the hydrogenation of 1,3-dienes. The product alkene results from 1,4-addition of hydrogen. The complex does not hydrogenate isolated double bonds. A variety of arenes ligands have been installed aside from benzene. Weakly coordinating ligands may be employed to improve ligand exchange and thus the turnover rates for (Œ∑6-C6H6)M(CO)3 complexes.(Œ∑6-C6H6)M(CO)3 complexes have been incorporated into high surface area porous materials. (Œ∑6-C6H6)M(CO)3 complexes serve as models for the interaction of metal carbonyls with graphene and carbon nanotubes. The presence of M(CO)3 on extended œÄ-network materials has been shown to improve electrical conductivity across the material. Reactivity of [(Œ∑6-C6H6)Mn(CO)3]+ Typical arene tricarbonyl piano stool complexes of Mn(I) and Re(I) are cationic and thus exhibit enhanced reactivity toward nucleophiles. Subsequent to nucleophilic addition, the modified arene can be recovered from the metal. :600px =(Œ∑6-C6H6)Ru complexes= Half-sandwich compounds employing Ru(II), such as (cymene)ruthenium dichloride dimer, have been mainly investigated as catalysts for transfer hydrogenation. These complexes feature three coordination sites that are susceptible to substitution, while the arene ligand is tightly bonded and protects the metal against oxidation to Ru(III). They are prepared by reaction of RuCl3¬∑x(H2O) with 1,3-cyclohexadienes. Work is also conducted on their potential as anticancer drugs. :500px (Œ∑6-C6H6)RuCl2 readily undergoes ligand exchange via cleavage of the chloride bridges, making this complex a versatile precursor to Ru(II) piano stool derivatives.

The stated purpose of the organization is to provide an independent documentation of human rights violations within Syria, a resource that may help any future justice-related procedures. The center's main sources of information include medical records, families of the victims and information received from the Imam of the mosque that performed the burial. The VDC was founded by Razan Zaitouneh, a Syrian lawyer and human rights activist, and Mazen Darwish, a Syrian lawyer and free speech advocate, in June 2011.

He is famous for his statement of the law of diminishing returns in his Essay on the Application of Capital to Land (1815, p. 2): \\"The principle is simply this, that in the progress of the improvement of cultivation the raising of rude produce becomes progressively more expensive, or, in other words, the ratio of the net produce of land to its gross produce is constantly diminishing.\\" (The gross produce means the value of total output and the net is the gross minus the cost of production and exclusive of profit and rent.) Edward was born in 1782 (baptized 5 April 1782) to John Balchen West, Receiver General for Hertfordshire. His parents died when he was still very young and Edward was brought up by an uncle, Sir Martin Browne Ffolkes, FRS at Hillington Hall near King's Lynn. Edward's sister Frances later married Captain Lane of the 47th Regiment of Foot. West studied at Harrow and then at University College, Oxford. He graduated first class and was distinguished in the classics and mathematics. In 1814 he was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. Hillingston Hall in Norfolk where West grew up. In 1815 he wrote an essay arguing against the \\"impolicy of any great restriction on the importation of corn\\" which was appreciated by the economist David Ricardo. In 1825 he wrote a pamphlet on the \\"Price of Corn and Wages of Labour\\" in which he expressed what is now known as the law of diminishing returns. This little known essay was reprinted in 1903 by Johns Hopkins University with a preface by Dr Jacob Hollander. Notice upon the death of West issued by Sir John Malcolm Edward West married Lucretia ffolkes, daughter of his guardian uncle, on 26 August 1822 at Marylebone Church. West was appointed Recorder of the King's Court of Bombay and knighted in the same year. The couple reached Bombay on 1 February 1823. He became Chief Justice on 8 May 1823. He chose to enforce order leading to being seen unfavourably by many officers in the employment of the East India Company. He suspended several barristers and dismissed some officers, notably William Erskine, Master in Equity, suspected of improbity (mostly taking bribes in cases). Mountstuart Elphinstone and some other Europeans went on the side of Erskine. Erskine's position was taken by Fenwick, a nephew of West. George Norton, a recently appointed Advocate General for Bombay introduced fees that were seven times that received in England. Norton and West clashed on this order. Lady West. No portrait of Sir Edward exists. West and Lucretia had a daughter Fanny Anna in 1826. West died at Poona where he was buried. Lucretia died during the birth of her second child (the infant son also died) in 1828, shortly after the death of her husband. A scholarship was started in Bombay by the citizens in his honour.

A Piltown GAA club was founded in 1887. Several versions existed until the modern club founded in 1953 following the advent of Parish Rule in Kilkenny. Piltown fields teams in Hurling, Gaelic Football, Camogie and Ladies' Gaelic Football at all ages from Under-8 to adult in each code. History Piltown GAA was formed in 1887, and went through many amalgamations until Parish Rule was introduced in the 1950s. The modern club was formed in 1953. The original grounds consisting of about 5 acres were purchased from the Land Commission on 1 November 1945 The original trustees were Canon Philip Comerford PP, Patrick Power MCC (Piltown) and Richard Keating (Clonmore). The price paid was ¬£77. In 1957, Eddie Norris and Pa O'Shea replaced Canon Comerford and Patrick Power as trustees and Bob Aylward, the County Board Chairman was added to the trustees. Early meetings took place at St. Columba's Hall which was located at the old graveyard in Piltown. After it was demolished, meetings took place at Anthony's Inn, Piltown National School and eventually in the dressing room that used to exist at the road end. In 1961, the club started raising funds through the annual fete (carnivals), commencing on Easter Sunday. They featured live music in a marquee, amusements and tournament hurling matches with top class clubs from all over the south east. Work started on developing the grounds in the early sixties. In 1961, the wall at the road end was erected along with the original dressing rooms, complete with showers and toilets. In 1962/63, the pitch was levelled resodded and drained. In 1964, a 10-foot wire and post fence was erected around the main pitch. In 1965, the toolshed and the original scoreboard was erected at the road end and it took about ¬£9000 to transform the pitch. The main playing pitch was officially opened on 12 August 1965 when the Kilkenny Senior Hurling team played a challenge match against Waterford. The game was refereed by Tommy Foran and the Kilkenny team featured Piltown's Ned Power (Brenor). In 1972, an additional 12 acres of adjacent lands were purchased. These were lands formerly owned by Issac and Lilly Tector from Piltown. The representatives of the club paid ¬£3,500 for it, (¬£500 more than their brief), proceeds of the carnivals. In 1977, it was decided provide a complex building with an estimated cost of ¬£40,000. With the popularity of carnivals beginning to wane, a new source of income had to be found. In 1982, the club ran a 600 club draw which a year later turned into what is now known as the Hurlers Co- op draw. (In 1991, the Kilkenny County Board became involved) Since the 1980s, Piltown GAA has played an integral part in the community with the provision of two full size playing pitches and a juvenile pitch, a handball court, two squash courts and a gym, with Bar & Social facilities in the GAA Complex that was constructed in 1985. The GAA Complex was officially opened by the former President of the GAA, Paddy Buggy on 15 August 1986. A third pitch soon followed in the 1990s and became an all-weather pitch before having match standard floodlights added. The floodlighting on the all-weather pitch was switched on for the first time on Friday 18 November 2005. The first championship game played underlights in Kilkenny took place in Piltown. It was a Senior Football championship clash between Piltown and Railyard in February 2006 with the result being a win for the visitors. A warm-up area was then created at the lower end of the all-weather pitch. In 2010, a shed from the old sugar factory in Carlow was re-erected as a stand and 2013, some benches were added around the pitch. In 2012, work started on a precast hurling wall and the redevelopment of the pitch-and-putt course into a fourth playing field. The hurling wall precast structure was erected on 30 March. Lighting was added in 2013. Also in 2013, work started on removing the old wire fence and replacing it with a more modern aesthetically improved lower fence. There have been many successes on the field, with the highlight year being 2003 when the club won the county Junior hurling title and the Leinster Junior hurling title. (There was no All-Ireland series in 2003) The year was capped by becoming the AIB Kilkenny Club of the Year. The original club played in two Senior County Finals in 1904 and 1910, unfortunately losing out on both occasions to Tullaroan. At juvenile level the biggest achievement was winning Division 3 of F√©ile Na nGael in 1979 when hosted in Kilkenny and being runners-up in Division 1 to Wolfe Tones (Clare) when hosted in Clare in 1986. Piltown also won the National Community games title in 1989 beating Portumna of Galway. They have been hurling county titles won all the way up from Schools to Junior. Although hurling is the predominant interest of most Piltown GAA fans, the Piltown area has a very strong Gaelic Football tradition and have won two Intermediate county titles and one junior county title as well as many underage and schools titles. There have been several iterations of Camogie clubs but the current one is the most vibrant and successful. Piltown Camogie won a junior title in 2008 and an Intermediate league title in 2013. Numerous Camogie titles have been won at all age groups at county level. They have also won a Leinster Community Games title in 2009 when beating Lucan Sarsfields and subsequently taking the bronze medal nationally. In 2010, and based on the foundation of several primary schools county titles, a Ladies Gaelic Football club was set up. It primarily catered for juveniles but in 2013, Gaelic4Mothers & Others was introduced. The Under-14 team reached the Roinn B County final in 2013. Also in 2014, the parish fielded two teams in the Roinn A primary schools championship. One from Piltown NS and the other from a combination of Owning NS and Templeorum NS.

Camogie Camogie has been played in Piltown for many years. The earliest reports of a team in the parish was Owning Camogie Club. This team existed around the late 1950s, early 1960s. They trained in a field in Fanningstown opposite where Bertie Duggan lives. Among their players were Tessie Duggan (Flynn), Eileen Kiely (Norris), Breda Power, Maud Murphy (Kelly) and Kathleen Duggan (Holden). There were also players from Windgap such as Wazzie Power and Eileen Doyle. There are no reports of any successes but there are stories of vans being stolen to get to matches in Mullinavat! Granddaughters of Eileen Kiely and Wazzie Power play for the club today. In the late 1970s, Piltown had a minimal club fielding at only Under-14. This team did compete in the Under-14 Feile Na nGael competition when it was held in Kilkenny in 1978 and 1979. Sean O'Shea was the chairman at the time. 1978 Panel: Josie O‚ÄôShea, Michelle Gilman, Lucy Giles, Marie Fitzpatrick, Mary Kinsella, Fiona Knox, Carmel Phelan, Margaret Holden, Evonne Fitzpatrick, Marie Cuddihy, Celia Giles, Ann Dunne, Ann O‚ÄôBrien, Margaret Carroll, Lucy Knox, Margaret Talbot. 1979 Panel: Marie Fitzpatrick, Michelle Gilman, Lucy Knox, Bernadette Gilman, Majella Giles, Stephanie Carroll, Ann Dunne, Kay Cuddihy, Evonne Fitzpatrick, Denise Everett, Celia Giles, Fiona Coffey, Marie Power, Rosemary O‚ÄôToole, Pauline Foyle. In the 1980s, Piltown Camogie Club emerged with the driving force being Maura Brennan (Owning). The team included several girls who have children playing today such as Sheila Keegan (Norris), Kay McCarthy (Phelan) and Teresa Brophy (Phelan). Like the Owning club before there were also players from the Windgap parish like Joan O'Gorman, Judith Phelan and Mary Norris (Walsh). The Junior team contested the Junior \\"B\\" County Final in 1988. A strong Tullogher team beat them 6-6 to 0-3 on a wet day in Nowlan Park. The manager was Willie McCormack. Others to manage the team in that period were Dan Phelan, Jim Grant and Seamus Norris. The club colours were white and red. This club did win an Under-14 Roinn C title around 1987 or 1988 and featured players like Cathy and Mairead Brennan. Michelle O'Shea was another prominent underage player during this period. The club continued into the 1990s when titles at Under-14 Roinn \\"C\\" (1994) and Under-16 Roinn\\"C\\" (1996) were captured, both teams were captained by current coach Miram Reid. During the 1980s and 1990s, Piltown's most successful Camogie player to date, Marie Fitzpatrick (Oldcourt) played Camogie with St Brigid‚Äôs, Ballycallan. Marie had won the Feile Skills in 1980 and is one of only two Kilkenny girls to have won the National title. She went on to play in goal for the Kilkenny most successful ever senior team, winning seven senior All- Ireland medals and six National League medals. In 2000, Eileen Malone and Marie O'Sullivan founded the current version of Piltown Camogie Club. Former Chairperson from the previous incarnation of the club, Maura Brennan, along with Jim Malone, Catherine McCarthy, Bernie Duggan and Frances Malone quickly came on board to form a strong committee. They were soon joined by Kate Foley who proved to be a top class administrator They formed the backbone for the marvellous successes that have followed. Starting with a group of 20 primary school girls the club claimed County titles at Primary Schools and Under-14 in 2002. The club has since built up a membership of over 100 players, competing at all grades. It has now claimed several county titles in every grade right up to Junior. The club claimed its first adult title in 2008 by winning the junior county final, beating Dicksboro in a replay in Piltown. The panel featured players from previous versions of the club such as Mairead Diffley (Brennan) and Michelle O'Shea. It also had Piltown's most successful current player, Katie Power who won an All-Star in 2009 and a second in 2013. In 2009, the club won the bronze medal at the National Community Games finals in Athlone. In 2010, Roinn A titles were won at Primary Schools level and Under-14. Many of the club's players have represented the county with distinction as the club goes from strength to strength. In 2013, the club won its first Intermediate County Title when they beat Ballyhale Shamrocks 0-13 to 0-10 in John Locke Park, Callan. However the Shamrocks gained revenge in the Champions Final in Mullinavat when they beat Piltown 1-9 to 0-11 after extra time. Twelve months later on 11 October 2014, Piltown returned to the Intermediate Championship County Final having already secured the All-County League and League titles in 2014 after wins over St. Annes. The venue was John Locke Park, Callan and the opponents, St, Brigids of Kilmanagh. Piltown won the final comprehensively by 4-18 to 0-5 to become a senior club for the first time ever and compile an unprecedented treble while remaining unbeaten in Kilkenny in competitive games in 2014. Kelly Ann Doyle was awarded the inaugural Shem Downey Player of the Match award. They then went on to win the Leinster title when they beat Camross of Laois in the final held in Clane by 3-10 to 4-5 with Karen Duggan picking up the player of the match award. They then rounded this run off by achieving the ultimate prize of winning the 2015 All-Ireland title by beating the reigning champions, Lismore of Waterford 1-10 to 1-9 at Croke Park with Chloe Blackmore scoring the Piltown goal and Kelly Ann Doyle winning the player of the match award.

In 2007, the girls again won the mini Sevens in Kilkenny. In 2008, a landmark was reached when the Primary Schools team won the Roinn B championship in Nowlan Park by beating Gowran by 5-6 to 2-2. In 2009, the School followed up with victory in the Roinn A final. It came after a replay with Thomastown in Nowlan Park when they comprehensively won by 10-1 to 1-2 Jennifer Norris and Sinead McCarthy became the first Piltown girls to play inter county for Kilkenny when they were part of the 2009 Leinster Under-14 Championship squad.

It was the first time Kilkenny had won a Leinster ladies football blitz title. In 2010, the interest in Ladies Gaelic Football skyrocketed. Owning and Templeourm National Schools combined to compete in the schools championships. Furthermore, a club was set up in Piltown. The year was memorable in that Piltown National School won their third County Title in a row (2nd Roinn A) and Owning/Templeorum won the Roinn D title at the first attempt. Two primary schools county titles in the one year! Sheila Norris started work on the new club. She was joined by Siobhan McCarthy and Fran McGrath and a trainer from Wicklow, John Kavanagh.

In 2012, the club fielded an Under-12 team. In 2013, Kilkenny underage leagues were formed and minors were permitted to play with Three Friars club in adult games who entered the Tipperary Junior championship. Three Friars won the Junior \\"C\\" title beating Moyle Rovers in Munroe by 1-7 to 0-3, thus Jennifer Norris, Lorraine Long and Aine Knox won junior county medals.

Wright matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 21 May 1571, and graduated B.A. 1574, and M.A. 1578. He was an ardent Calvinist, and received ordination at Antwerp from Villiers or Cartwright in the Genevan form. At Cambridge, he became acquainted with Robert, second lord Rich, and about 1580 acted as his chaplain in his house, Great Leighs, Essex, where he held religious meetings (Strype, Aylmer, pp. 54 seq.). He was incorporated M.A. of Oxford on 11 July 1581. After several efforts on Bishop Aylmer's part to obtain the arrest of Wright, he and his patron were examined in the court of ecclesiastical commission in October 1581 in the presence of Lord Burghley. It was shown that Wright had asked, in regard to the solemnisation of the queen's accession day (17 Nov.), ‚Äòif they would make it an holy day, and so make our queen an idol. Wright was committed to the Fleet prison. Next year the prison-keeper on his own authority permitted him to visit his wife in Essex, but complaints were made of this lenient treatment to Lord Burghley. Wright appealed for mercy to Burghley, who replied by informing him of the charges brought against him. Wright sent a voluminous answer (Strype, Annals, iii. ii. 228). He seems to have returned to prison and remained there until September 1582, when he declared his willingness to subscribe to his good allowance of the ministry of the church of England and to the Book of Common Prayer.‚Äô After giving sureties for his future conformity, he was released. He was subsequently rector of Dennington, Suffolk, from 1589 until his death in 1624. Personal He was the son of John Wright of Wright's Bridge, Essex. He died in 1624.

History The name \\"Taftanaz\\" is neither an Arabic nor Turkish word. Instead, it is likely that the name is of Hittite origins.Palestine Exploration Fund, 1881, p. 222. Taftanaz was mentioned in an inscription on the Temple of Karnak as one of the places conquered by Thutmose III during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt in the 15th-century BCE.Birch, 1891, p. 38. =Syrian civil war= Residents of Taftanaz participated in several successive demonstrations protesting the Syrian government starting from April 2011, the beginning of the uprising. Between the first April demonstration and April 2012, security forces raided the town four times. In October 2011, clashes between the Syrian Army and local rebels resulted in the deaths of five people in Taftanaz. On 21 March 2012 further heavy clashes occurred between the army and rebels, forcing rebels to retreat from Taftanaz.Syria Live Blog. Al Jazeera English. 2012-03-21. On 3 April 2012, the Syrian Army shelled Taftanaz before launching a heavy three-day assault on the town. At least 62 people were reported killed and by June about two-thirds of the population fled the town. The Ghazal family lost 39 of its members in the assault. Another account put civilian fatalities at 56 and claimed 60% of the town's residents fled, mostly north to Turkey.Espinosa, Javier. Syria: Defiance of village where army killed 39 from a single family. The Guardian. 2012-06-08. Although residents claim that the presence of anti-government fighters was small, rebels from the general area were responsible for several attacks on army checkpoints resulting in the destruction of around nine tanks and the deaths of a number of soldiers. Residents also claim the army assault was meant to stymie protests in the surrounding villages by making an example of Taftanaz which largely joined the uprising early on. Although protests continue to be held by young residents in Taftanaz, they are much smaller since the 3 April assault. State media reported that a rebel assault on the Taftanaz Military Airbase was repelled and several rebels were killed on 29 August.Syria's Assad says military needs time to win battle\\".

Wallelign was the author of the highly influential but contentious article \\"On the Question of Nationalities in Ethiopia\\" published in 1969. Early life Walelign Mekonnen Wallelign was born in Amhara Sayint, in South Wollo, part of Amhara National Regional State.Kiflu Tadesse, 1993: The Generation: The History of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, Part I: From Early Beginnings to 1975. Silver Spring MD, Independent Publishers: 53. He graduated from Woizero Sehin Secondary School in Dessie. Student leader Wallelign enrolled at the then Haile Selassie I University as a Political Science student. Wallelign soon became involved in the radical student groups that were proliferating at the University. Due to his student activism he was arrested and sentenced to five years imprisonment in April 1969, but was pardoned by Emperor Haile Selassie shortly afterwards.Kiflu, 1993: 50-51.Randi R√∏nning Balsvik, 1985: Haile Selassie's Students: The Intellectual and Social Background to Revolution, 1952-1977. East Lansing, Michigan: African Studies Center, Michigan State University: 250-260. \\"On the Question of Nationalities in Ethiopia\\" Wallelign‚Äôs most famous article \\"On the Question of Nationalities in Ethiopia\\" was published in the student movement‚Äôs journal Struggle in November 1969. In this article Wallelign tried to analyze 'national oppression' in Imperial Ethiopia and argued that as Ethiopia was not one nation, but rather a collection of different nations and nationalities, whose struggle for self- determination should be supported by the student movement as long as they are committed to socialism. This was a highly contentious area that divided the student movement at the time, but Wallelign‚Äôs views eventually came to dominate the student movement as well as the political parties that it spawned.Bahru Zewde, 2010: Documenting the Ethiopian Student Movement: An Exercise in Oral History.

As a result of the publication a police harassment and media campaign was unleashed against the student movement and Struggle's publication was suspended. The following month, Tilahun Gizaw, president of the University Students' Union of Addis Ababa, was assassinated by what is presumed to be agents of the state.Kiflu, 1993: 54. Wallelign was arrested again in December 1969 and imprisoned until May 1971.Kiflu, 1993: 65. Death and legacy After his release Wallelign worked in the Ministry of Ground Transportation and remained active in the radical movement. On December 10, 1972, Wallelign and six fellow activists attempted to hijack an Ethiopian Airlines flight leaving Addis Ababa for Europe.Kiflu, 1993: 72. Following a string of hijackings carried out by Eritrean and Ethiopian activists in the late 1960s and early 1970s however, Ethiopian security officers had been placed on such flights, and a shoot-out ensued that took the lives of five of the hijackers including Wallelign. He was buried in Dessie. At the end of the Ethiopian Civil War the rebel Ethiopian People‚Äôs Revolutionary Democratic Front named its Wollo offensive Operation Wallelign in honour of the fallen activist. Wallelign's views are embedded in the current Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia which recognizes the unconditional right of \\"every Nation, Nationality and People in Ethiopia... to self-determination, including the right to secession\\".

Its purpose was to ensure more accurate, consistent and uniform disability determination decisions under the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, and to ensure that applicants were treated fairly and humanely. It has been described as \\"one of the key pieces of social welfare legislation\\" enacted toward the end of Reagan's first term in office. Origins In 1981, Reagan ordered the Social Security Administration (SSA) to tighten up enforcement of the Disability Amendments Act of 1980, which resulted in more than a million disability beneficiaries having their benefits stopped. This, as well as enforcement by the SSA of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, resulted in widespread public, media and federal court criticism of the agency. By 1984, the disability review process had nearly collapsed, and an internal SSA memo acknowledged that the agency's credibility was at an all-time low. This resulted in Congress creating the Reform Act, which had the effect of strengthening the legal position of SSDI beneficiaries. Overview The Reform Act instituted a \\"medical improvement standard\\" that said benefits could only be terminated if certain conditions were met, and put the burden of proof on the Social Security Administration (SSA) to demonstrate that the individual was capable of engaging in \\"substantial gainful activity\\". It liberalized the screening process that applicants undergo in order to qualify for SSDI benefits, making it more subjective and complex. It directed the SSA, when assessing applications, to place increased weight on applicants' statements about their own pain and discomfort, to relax screening for mental illness, to consider multiple non-severe ailments to be disabling even if none were disabling by themselves, and to shift emphasis from the Social Security medical assessment towards the assessment of the applicant's own doctor. These changes had the effect of increasing the number of new SSDI awards and shifting their composition towards claimants with low-mortality disorders such as mental illness and back pain. Effects In a 2006 analysis, Autor and Duggan wrote that the act has been the most significant factor in recent growth of SSDI usage. The share of the U.S. population receiving SSDI benefits has risen rapidly over the past two decades, from 2.2 percent of adults age 25 to 64 in 1985 to 4.1 percent in 2005.

It is primarily associated with the early 7th to the early 5th centuries BC, sometimes called the \\"Lyric Age of Greece\\",Andrew W. Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology in Translation (Hackett, 1996), p. xi. but continued to be written into the Hellenistic and Imperial periods. Background Lyric is one of three broad categories of poetry in classical antiquity, along with drama and epic, according to the scheme of the \\"natural forms of poetry\\" developed by Goethe in the early nineteenth century. (Drama is considered a form of poetry here because both tragedy and comedy were written in verse in ancient Greece.). Culturally, Greek lyric is the product of the political, social and intellectual milieu of the Greek polis (\\"city-state\\").Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology, p. xi. Much of Greek lyric is occasional poetry, composed for public or private performance by a soloist or chorus to mark particular occasions. The symposium (\\"drinking party\\") was one setting in which lyric poems were performed.Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology, p. xii. \\"Lyric\\" was sometimes sung to the accompaniment of either a string instrument (particularly the lyre or kithana) or a wind instrument (most often the reed pipe called aulos). Whether the accompaniment was a string or wind instrument, the term for such accompanied lyric was melic poetry (from the Greek word for \\"song\\" melos). Lyric could also be sung without any instrumental accompaniment. This latter form is called meter and it is recited rather than sung, strictly speaking. Modern surveys of \\"Greek lyric\\" often include relatively short poems composed for similar purposes or circumstances that were not strictly \\"song lyrics\\" in the modern sense, such as elegies and iambics.Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology, pp. xii‚Äìxiii. The Greeks themselves did not include elegies nor iambus within melic poetry, since they had different metres and different musical instruments.Ragusa, Para Conhecer a \\"L√≠rica\\" Grega Arcaica, Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ci√™ncias Humanas, Universidade de S√£o Paulo: https://fflch.usp.br/sites/fflch.usp.br/files/2017-11/LiricaGregaArcaica.pdf The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome offers the following clarification: \\"'melic' is a musical definition, 'elegy' is a metrical definition, whereas 'iambus' refers to a genre and its characteristics subject matter. (...) The fact that these categories are artificial and potentially misleading should prompt us to approach Greek lyric poetry with an open mind, without preconceptions about what 'type' of poetry we are reading.\\" Greek lyric poems celebrate athletic victories (epinikia), commemorate the dead, exhort soldiers to valor, and offer religious devotion in the forms of hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Partheneia, \\"maiden-songs,\\" were sung by choruses of maidens at festivals.David E. Gerber, A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets (Brill, 1997), pp. 161, 201, 217, 224, 230. Love poems praise the beloved, express unfulfilled desire, proffer seductions, or blame the former lover for a breakup. In this last mood, love poetry might blur into invective, a poetic attack aimed at insulting or shaming a personal enemy, an art at which Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet, excelled. The themes of Greek lyric include \\"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\\" and hetero- and homosexual love. In the 3rd century BC, the encyclopedic movement at Alexandria produced a canon of the nine melic poets: Alcaeus, Alcman, Anacreon, Bacchylides, Ibycus, Pindar, Sappho, Simonides, and Stesichorus.Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology, p. xiii. Only a small sampling of lyric poetry from Archaic Greece, the period when it first flourished, survives. For example, the poems of Sappho are said to have filled nine papyrus rolls in the Library of Alexandria, with the first book alone containing more than 1,300 lines of verse. Today, only one of Sappho's poems exists intact, with fragments from other sources that would scarcely fill a chapbook.Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology, p. xv. Meters See main article: Prosody (Greek) Greek poetry meters are based on patterns of long and short syllables (in contrast to English verse, which is determined by stress), and lyric poetry is characterized by a great variety of metrical forms. Apart from the shift between long and short syllables, stress must be considered when reading Greek poetry. The interplay between the metric \\"shifts\\", the stressed syllables and caesuras is an integral part of the poetry. It allows the poet to stress certain words and shape the meaning of the poem. There are two main divisions within the meters of ancient Greek poetry: lyric and non- lyric meters. \\"Lyric meters (literally, meters sung to a lyre) are usually less regular than non-lyric meters. The lines are made up of feet of different kinds, and can be of varying lengths. Some lyric meters were used for monody (solo songs), such as some of the poems of Sappho and Alcaeus; others were used for choral dances, such as the choruses of tragedies and the victory odes of Pindar.\\" The lyric meters' families are the Ionic, the Aeolic (based on the choriamb, which can generate varied kinds of verse, such as the glyconian or the Sapphic stanza), and the Dactylo- epitrite.http://www.aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf The Doric choral songs were composed in complex triadic forms of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, with the first two parts of the triad having the same metrical pattern, and the epode a different form.Miller, Greek Lyric: An Anthology, pp. xiii‚Äìxiv.

History The historic Boyer-Mertz Farm complex had its genesis in a land patent granted to John Coates on November 27, 1800 by John Penn and Richard Penn, descendants of Pennsylvania's founder, William Penn. That patent, which was subsequently transferred to Phillip Mertz on June 30, 1802 became the basis for possession of the farm's acreage by the Mertz family until 1845 when it sold to Solomon and Benneville Boyer with Benneville Boyer ultimately retaining sole ownership of the property with his wife, Mary. In 1871, the Boyers improved the property by erecting a barn there, per that barn's datestone.

This system is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.89. The pair are located approximately 360 light years away from the Sun, based on parallax, and are moving further away with a radial velocity of +83 km/s, having come to within an estimated of the Earth nearly a million years ago. 81 Geminorum lies close enough to the ecliptic to undergo lunar occultations. The variable velocity of this system was first suspected at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in 1921, then confirmed by the Lick Observatory in 1922. It is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of and an eccentricity of 0.325. The visible component is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of K4 III, having exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core then expanded to 34 times the Sun's radius. It is over six billion years old with 1.22 times the mass of the Sun. This is a candidate alpha-enhanced star that displays a significant overabundance of silicon. The star is radiating around 287 times the Sun's luminosity from its bloated photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,095 K.

Some spurious languages have been proven to not exist. Others have very little evidence supporting their existence, and have been dismissed in later scholarship. Others still are of uncertain existence due to limited research. Below is a sampling of languages that have been claimed to exist in reputable sources but have subsequently been disproved or challenged. In some cases a purported language is tracked down and turns out to be another, known language. This is common when language varieties are named after places or ethnicities. Some alleged languages turn out to be hoaxes, such as the Kukur√° language of Brazil or the Taensa language of Louisiana. Others are honest errors that persist in the literature despite being corrected by the original authors; an example of this is ', the name given in 1892 to two Colonial word lists, one of Tlingit and one of a Salishan language, that were mistakenly listed as Patagonian. The error was corrected three times that year, but nonetheless \\"Hongote\\" was still listed as a Patagonian language a century later in Greenberg (1987). In the case of New Guinea, one of the most linguistically diverse areas on Earth, some spurious languages are simply the names of language surveys that the data was published under. Examples are , Kia, , , listed as Indo-Pacific languages in Ruhlen 1987; these are actually rivers that gave their names to language surveys in the Greater Awyu languages and Ok languages of New Guinea.Upper Kaeme may correspond to Korowai.

Also included is a partial list of languages (with their SIL codes) that appeared at one time in Ethnologue but were removed prior to 2006, arranged by the first edition in which they did not appear. The list includes codes that have been retired from ISO 639-3 or languages removed from Ethnologue because the language apparently does not exist and cannot be identified with an existing language. The list does not include instances where the \\"language\\" turns out to be a spelling variant of another language or the name of a village where an already known language is spoken; these are cases of duplicates, which are resolved in ISO 639-3 by a code merger. It does include \\"languages\\" for which there is no evidence or which cannot be found. (In some cases, however, the evidence for nonexistence is a survey among the current population of the area, which would not identify extinct languages such as Ware below.) SIL codes are upper case; ISO codes are lower case. Once retired, ISO 639-3 codes are not reused. SIL codes that were retired prior to 2006 may have been re-used or may have reappeared as ISO codes for other languages. =Removed from Ethnologue, 12th ed., 1992= * (PNG) [] * (Brazil) [] * (PNG) [] * , (Brazil) [] * () [] * (PNG) [] * (Mexico) [] ‚Äì added to Ethnologue 1988 by mistake due to a misunderstanding, removed in 1992.

Life Left early an orphan, Wright was brought up in his mother's family, who sent him to boarding schools at Attercliffe, near Sheffield, and Darton, near Wakefield. In 1699 he entered the Attercliffe academy of Timothy Jollie. Leaving in 1704, he became chaplain at Haigh, Lancashire, to his uncle, Cotton, on whose death he repaired to another uncle, Thomas Cotton (1653‚Äì1730), presbyterian minister at Dyott Street, Bloomsbury. For a short time he was chaplain to 'the Lady Susannah Lort' at Turnham Green, preaching also the Sunday evening lecture at Dyott Street. In 1705 he was chosen assistant to Benjamin Grosvenor at Crosby Square, and undertook in addition (1706) a Sunday evening lecture at St. Thomas's Chapel, Southwark, with Harman Hood. On the death (25 January 1708) of Matthew Sylvester, he accepted the charge of 'a handful of people' at Meeting House Court, Knightrider Street, and was ordained on 15 April; his \\"confession of faith\\" was appended to The Ministerial Office (1708), by Daniel Williams. Wright's ministry was successful: the meeting-house was twice enlarged, if wrecked by the Sacheverell riots in 1710. He was elected a Sunday lecturer at Little St. Helen's. His Calvinistic orthodoxy was unimpeachable, but, probably influenced by Grosvenor, he took (1719) the side of non- subscription at the Salters' Hall conference. He contributed also to the Occasional Papers (1716‚Äì19), the organ of whig dissent. Popular, he was chosen (1724) one of the Salters' Hall lecturers, and elected (1724) a trustee of Dr. Williams's Foundations. On 1 May 1729 the diploma of D.D. was granted to him by Edinburgh University. In 1732‚Äì3 he had a sermon debate with Thomas Mole (d. 1780) on the foundation of virtue, which Wright could trace no higher than to the divine will. A new meeting-house was built for Wright in Carter Lane, Doctors' Commons (opened 7 December 1734; removed in 1860). Among Protestant dissenters he ranked as a presbyterian; his will explains his separation from \\"the common parochial worship\\" as an act of service to \\"catholic christianity\\". His delivery was striking; it is said that Thomas Herring attended his services, as samples of effective utterance. His communion services were known for fervour, and he was a sedulous pastor. Hughes admits a \\"particular turn of temper\\" which was not always agreeable. Satiric verses (1735?) describing London dissenting divines open with the lines: > Behold how papal Wright with lordly pride Directs his haughty eye to either > side, Gives forth his doctrine with imperious nod, And fraught with pride > addresses e'en his God Thomas Newman (1692‚Äì1758) was his assistant and successor. His portrait, in Dr. Williams's Library (engraving in Wilson), is one of the few portraits of dissenting divines vested in the Scottish doctor's gown. He married (1710) the widow of Sylvester, his predecessor, daughter of George Hughes, and had issue one daughter. Hughes gives a list (revised by Wilson) of forty-three publications by Wright (nearly all sermons), adding that he published several anonymous pieces. The most notable are: # 'A Little Treatise of being Born Again ... Four Sermons,' 1715, 12mo; 17th edit. 1761, 16mo. # 'A Treatise on the Deceitfulness of Sin,' 1726, 8vo. # 'Human Virtues,' 1730, 8vo. # 'Charity in all its Branches,' 1731, 8vo. # 'The Great Concern of Human Life,' 1732, 8vo; 3rd edit. 1733, 8vo. He was one of the continuators of the unfinished commentary of Matthew Henry, his part being St. James's Epistle. Personal Wright was the eldest son of James Wright, was born at Retford, Nottinghamshire, on 30 Jan. 1682‚Äì3. His grandfather, John Wright (d. 1 Feb. 1684‚Äì5). After long illness. He became nonconformist through the influence of William Cotton, a wealthy ironmaster of Wortley, near Sheffield, whose daughter Elinor (d. 1695) he married. He died on 3 April 1746, and was buried in the south aisle of Stoke Newington church, where is a Latin inscription (by Hughes) to his memory. Funeral sermons were preached by his brother-in-law Obadiah Hughes, and John Milner of Peckham. His father, James Wright (d. 1694), was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford (B.A. 1669), and Magdalene College, Cambridge (M.A. in December 1673). He preached at Attercliffe and Retford as a nonconformist.

Formerly housing the university's library, it also serves as a memorial to the Delawareans who died in World War I. The building was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Day & Klauder as part of their overall master plan for the university's central campus, which featured a consistent Georgian Revival architectural style. The library was built in 1923‚Äì25 under the supervision of university president Walter Hullihen, though it had to be scaled back from the original design for cost-saving reasons. It was remodeled and expanded in 1940 after a flood damaged part of the library collection. Library operations moved to the new Morris Library in 1963, and Memorial Hall now houses the UD Department of English. Situated at a prominent location at the center of the Green, the university's main common area, Memorial Hall is a -story, H-shaped building with a hipped-roofed central hall and gable-roofed wings. The architecture is Georgian, with brick walls, white wooden trim, and double-hung sash windows. The building's main entrances are on the north and south sides, each of which features a portico with Ionic columns. The central hall houses the war memorial display. History =Background= In the early 20th century, what is now the University of Delaware consisted of two separate institutions, Delaware College (whose campus now makes up the Old College Historic District) and the Women's College of Delaware. The two campuses were separated by about half a mile of sparsely developed \\"no man's land\\", which was purchased on behalf of Delaware College by Pierre S. du Pont in 1915. Soon thereafter, the college commissioned the Philadelphia firm of Frank Miles Day and Charles Klauder to design a master plan for the new land. The architects drafted a plan for a central \\"Green\\" surrounded by academic and residential buildings, with a large library building located midway between the men's and women's colleges. =Fundraising and construction= In 1918, Delaware College president Samuel Chiles Mitchell proposed making the planned library a memorial to the Delawareans who died in World War I, stating \\"Used by both colleges, it would be the dynamo of the whole institution.\\" Due to the unsatisfactory nature of the existing library facilities the new building became a high priority for both Mitchell and his successor, Walter Hullihen, who oversaw the merger of the men's and women's colleges to form the University of Delaware in 1921. Funding difficulties forced Hullihen to scale back the grand design of Day and Klauder to a more modest building capable of housing 100,000 volumes. In 1922, the university embarked on a fundraising campaign to raise the $300,000 needed for the building, which ended successfully with more than 26,000 members of the public pledging funds. Despite the successful campaign, funding problems continued as some of the pledged money failed to materialize and inflation drove up the cost of the building. The library committee balked at beginning construction without funds set aside for an endowment, despite warnings from committee member W. O. Sypherd that \\"Failure to build this Library now will be a moral failure, the results of which would be disastrous to the future welfare of the University.\\" The situation was eventually resolved by securing additional pledges from the existing donors and by modifying the library design to reduce the construction cost. At the groundbreaking ceremony on December 11, 1923, around 300 male students, alumni, and faculty dug out the building's basement with the women's college students on hand to serve refreshments. The library cornerstone was laid on June 9, 1924, on the occasion of the university's first joint commencement for both men and women. The building was complete by the end of the year, and most of the university's library collections were moved in over Christmas break. The library opened for business at the beginning of the spring semester in January 1925 and was later formally dedicated at an elaborate ceremony on Memorial Day, May 23. =Library= South facade of Memorial Hall showing the 1940 additions Memorial Hall served as the university's library from 1925 to 1963. It was the first facility shared by the women's and men's colleges (which continued to operate separately until 1945), and its prominent location halfway between the two at the center of the Green made the library the focal point of the campus. The brick archways on either side of the building, added in 1940, became known as the \\"kissing arches\\" due to their location on the dividing line between the male and female student populations. On July 5, 1937, heavy rainfall caused flooding throughout much of the university campus including the Memorial Library stacks, which were located in the basement. While the university librarian and a few other people were able to save much of the collection, the disaster underscored the need for improvements to the building, which was already seen as inadequate. To this end the building was expanded in 1940, with the east and west wings extended outward and a new wing added to the south side to allow the library stacks (with an expanded capacity of over 200,000 volumes) to be housed above ground. The basement was remodeled to house seminar rooms. The library was rededicated on February 5, 1940, with the total cost of the project coming in at $220,000. With the growing university placing an emphasis on expanding its library holdings, the collection had outgrown Memorial Hall by the early 1960s. As the building could not be expanded further without damaging the aesthetics and symmetry of the Green, a new and much larger library building was constructed nearby on South Green in 1962‚Äì63. After removal of the library collections, Memorial Hall was converted to office and classroom space. =Recent history= Memorial Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. After a $9.8 million renovation over a 15-month period in 1998‚Äì99, the building was rededicated for the second time on May 16, 1999. It currently houses the UD Department of English. Architecture The north entrance of the building Memorial Hall is a symmetrical H-shaped building with one and a half stories and a full basement. It was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Day & Klauder as part of their overall campus master plan, which was drafted in 1917 with later revisions. The building features a Georgian Revival architectural style \\"reminiscent of Jefferson's designs for the University of Virginia\\", with exterior walls of Flemish bond brickwork and white wooden trim. The majority of the windows are double-hung 12 over 12 sash windows, some of which are set in arched frames. Both the north and south facades of the building feature flat-roofed porticoes with Ionic columns. As originally built in 1924, the building consisted of only the hipped-roofed central hall and cupola with low wings on the east and west sides. During the 1940 rebuilding the central hall was expanded to the south to provide a new above-ground space for the library stacks, and gable- roofed extensions were added to the east and west wings. The central hall of the building houses the war memorial display and exhibition space. In its original form, the building housed library stacks in the basement and study areas and office space in the ground-floor wings. After the 1940 expansion, the stacks were moved to the south extension of the main hall and the basement was converted to classroom space. War memorial Memorial Hall is dedicated to the men and women from Delaware who died in World War I. The building's foyer contains a war memorial display consisting of four wall-mounted bronze tablets and a memorial book housed in a display case on a raised pedestal. Each page of the book contains the name of one of the 270 Delawareans who died in the war; the page is turned each weekday by cadets from the campus ROTC.

Published in 1987 (with a 1986 copyright), it is 1192 pages long. Somewhat notably, because of its size, the uncorrected proof was issued in two volumes.A fact some reviewers thought worth mentioning. The size and complexity of the novel have led it to be compared with Ulysses, The Recognitions, and Gravity's Rainbow.Karl 1990 The novel is 16th on the Wikipedia list of longest novels, and seventh among novels written in English, and the longest ever written in North America. Editions There were two first editions--neither dates itself before the other. In April 1987,According to the 2nd printing the first trade edition was published by Knopf. Ultramarine Press published a limited, numbered, signed edition, consisting of the Knopf edition (including its copyright and title page) rebound in leather. One month later, Knopf issued a second printing, with an expanded copyright/acknowledgements page. In 1993, a paperback edition was published by Dalkey Archive Press. Contrary to their usual policy, they let this edition go out of print. Dzanc Books lists Women and Men as a forthcoming title in their e-book reprints. A third print edition was announced by McElroy in March 2015, originally intended to be released in the spring of that year.  Organization  The novel is divided into three kinds of chapters. The chapters with all lowercase titles are, in essence, independent short stories about characters in the novel, but they can be read and appreciated separately from the rest of the novel. Most were, in fact, published as short stories, with two of them being anthologized in \\"best of the year\\" short story collections. Stylistically, they are some of the most accessible fictions McElroy has written. Sections with titles in all-caps that include the word \\"BREATHER\\" in the title are narrated in a first-person plural, by a collective of so-called \\"angels\\". They are speaking in the second-person to their interrogator/torturer, whose identity changes, as if the interrogators/torturers were clocking in and out for their job. They tell of a future time when a certain naturally found alloy turns out to have special teleportation powers, and is used to send two people out to the Earth- Moon libration points, where they become merged (without prior knowledge) into one. Stylistically, they are quite difficult, with tense and point of view and topic not always clear. suggested that the \\"you\\" being tortured might literally be the reader. In the words of Frederick Karl, the breathers \\"are attempts to break away from historical narrative into simultaneity.\\" Sections in all-caps that do not include the word \\"BREATHER\\" and those with titles in normal title-case are mostly straightforward narrations, but they are intricately plotted and intimately related to the more difficult portions.  Plot summary  The novel, nominally set in 1976‚Äì77, but with long passages set in 1893‚Äì4, 1945, 1960‚Äì2, and 1973, centers around the life, the partly mythic ancestry, and the partly science fictional future of James Mayn, a business and technology journalist. He lives in the same Lower East Side building as one Grace Kimball. Grace has numerous close ties with just about everyone Jim knows in the novel. These ties include the ordinary, day-to-day interactions with people who know Jim and Grace, and the extraordinary, as Grace's dreams closely parallel the mythic version of Jim's grandmother's life. Jim and Grace \\"never quite meet\\",p. 10 although Jim goes so far as to knock on Grace's door but then changes his mind. There is a MacGuffin in the guise of a never-performed opera Hamletin based on Hamlet by a Chilean woman, the mother of the zoologist Mena. The opera apparently has magical powers, anathema to fascists and dictators.p. 1190 A production in a former warehouse in the Upper West Side is in rehearsals. What follows is a version of the events in the novel arranged in a timeline. Large portions of the story are told in a \\"spiral\\" style, with a little bit told at first, then repeated with a little bit more, and so on. Often, multiple plotlines are advanced nearly simultaneously, in long rushing sentences that refer to minor details across the decades and centuries. As an example, some important characters go without a name until very late in the novel. = 1834‚Äì1837 = Marion Hugh Mayne founds the Windrow Democrat as an advocacy newspaper for Andrew Jackson, and writes a diary.

After one such flash, the last Anasazi sees the Moon double. A pistol that traces back to Colt's original factory casts two shadows, and the Anasazi admitted to uncertainty of which of two stories is the correct one regarding the pistol's provenance. The American Marcus Jones, studying locoweed, meets the Chilean Mena, studying the javelina (also called \\"peccary\\" or \\"wild pig\\") migrating up from the Southern Hemisphere.

His father Mel was owner and editor of The Windrow Democrat. His mother Sarah was a distant relative of Mel, from the \\"Mayne\\" branch, which had owned the paper before Mel, going back to its founding as an advocacy paper for Andrew Jackson and the Bank War. Sarah had an affair with neighbor Bob Yard, who is apparently the father of Brad, Jim's younger brother. Sarah disappeared after visiting the shore, leaving a suicide note, in the summer of 1945. Jim never dreams, until near the end of the novel, when he has a dream of the \\"Safe Bomb\\", which destroys property without harming people. Jim is aware of being in the future, and of using the two- become-one teleportation. Sarah's parents were Alexander and Margaret Mayne. Margaret, as a young girl in 1885, was told to \\"go west\\" by the Hermit- Inventor of New York. She did so in 1893, reporting for her uncle on the Chicago World's Fair. Touring the West, she returns, reporting on Jacob Coxey as she passes through Pennsylvania. She meets Jack London taking part in Coxey's Army. Based on her reports, Alexander goes looking for Margaret. The Hermit-Inventor of New York reappears, apparently every other generation, as the \\"nephew\\" of his previous self. His meeting with Sarah in 1945 precipitated her disappearance. Jim married Joy, later divorced. Their two children are Andrew, who is estranged from Jim, and Sarah, usually called \\"Flick\\". Jim had an affair, early in the marriage, with Chilean journalist Mayga Rodriguez. Mayga had to return suddenly with her husband to Chile. She died shortly afterwards, from a suspicious fall off cliffs in Valpara√≠so. Jim is frequently shadowed by Ray Spence, also known as Ray Santee or Santee Sioux. Ray is at first an irritant to Jim, a smarmy journalist who usually just passes off press releases as news and who likes using information he unearths for personal gain. Later, he seems to develop into an outright nemesis, a possible danger to Jim. But in a face-to-face confrontation, Ray suddenly seems to be a sort of ally and perhaps a previously unknown brother to Jim. A Chilean economist named Mackenna, with his wife Clara, lives in fear of assassination. He is spied upon by Talca (or \\"de Talca\\"), an admiral in the Chilean navy and covertly a member of DINA, the Chilean secret police under Pinochet. Talca has an ongoing affair with Luisa, a Chilean-born Swiss-passport opera diva. Luisa hopes Talca can provide leniency for her father, under house arrest in Chile. Luisa relies on the \\"tapeworm diet\\". In Jim's building live Larry Shearson, a college freshman, with his father Marv. They have recently separated from Larry's mother Susan who, influenced by Grace, has declared she is a lesbian. Larry is sweet on Amy, a recent college graduate who works as Mackenna's assistant. A portion of Larry's freshman economics lecture is given, complete with four graphs and some formulas. Larry's friend Donald \\"D. D.\\" Dooley uses class time to challenge the professor on the role of classical economics in the contemporary world. Larry has developed theories of \\"obstacle geometry\\" and \\"simultaneous reincarnation\\". Separate excerpts Numerous chapters and excerpts appeared during the ten years it took McElroy to write the novel. The first edition, first printing, referred to these excerpts as \\"poems\\", McElroy's own term, and mentioned some of the journals where they had appeared. The second printing more neutrally referred to them as \\"parts,\\" and gave the complete list of literary journals, in addition to mention of the separate publication of the Ship Rock chapter as a limited edition chapbook. Two intended excerpts were dropped from the final novel, and have been republished in 2010 and 2011. A third intended excerpt was never completed.

In the published book, first edition, second printing, the author acknowledges that he \\"meditated\\" on E. F. Schumacher's Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered, especially the phrase \\"an articulated structure that can cope with a multiplicity of small-scale units\\", which is echoed repeatedly throughout the novel.

The first being Chocolat and the second The Lollipop Shoes. Set in France in 2010, at the beginning of Ramadan, it is the tale of two communities, culturally different, but in many ways alike, and the woman who brings them together.  Plot  Continuing from The Lollipop Shoes, Vianne Rocher, Roux, Anouk and Rosette are living on a houseboat on the River Seine. Anouk is now fifteen and Rosette is eight. Vianne believes that she may have found peace. Then she receives a letter from Lansquenet-sous-Tannes from Armande Voizin. Armande died eight years ago; she had left the letter, sealed within a letter for Luc, her grandson, when he attains 21. Armande had predicted that Lansquenet will need Vianne again. Vianne should visit, if only to put flowers on an old lady's grave. Vianne is intrigued and, seeking an excuse to escape the heat of the Paris summer, takes her daughters to Lansquenet. The village has changed in a number of unsettling ways: the principal change is that a community of Muslims from North Africa has settled across the river They have built a mosque, complete with a minaret. The priest of Lansquenet, Francis Reynaud, Vianne's adversary in Chocolat, has had some trouble with these Moroccans, and has recently been accused of setting fire to the small Muslim girls' school which replaced Vianne's chocolaterie. Reynaud denies all knowledge of the fire, but \\"the court of public opinion\\" has already found him guilty. The school was run by a Muslim woman called In√®s, who wears the full niqab face-veil, and who is viewed with suspicion from both sides of the river. The Moroccan community is filled with gossip about her; the French locals are suspicious of her because of the veil she wears, blaming her for the increasing numbers of women now wearing the niqab. Vianne is drawn to In√®s, partly because she was living in Vianne's chocolate shop before it burnt down, and partly because In√®s reminds her of aspects of herself. Both are single women with a young daughter; both are the subject of gossip and speculation. But, unlike Vianne, In√®s does not seem to want to mix or be accepted into the community. She remains silent and aloof, impervious to kindness or offers of help. Even Vianne's chocolates have no power over her, as she and the rest of the Moroccan community are fasting for Ramadan. Meanwhile, Vianne's old friend Jos√©phine, the battered wife in Chocolat who now runs the village caf√©, has also changed. She greets Vianne with affection, but seems embarrassed to see her. Vianne soon learns that Jos√©phine has had a son, a boy called Jean-Philippe (Pilou), who is now eight years old. Vianne finds it hard to understand how her old friend could have concealed this fact from her for all this time, and tries to find out who Pilou's father is, with no success. Vianne begins to suspect that Roux, whom she once believed might form a loving relationship with Jos√©phine, may be the boy's father. Vianne decides to stay for a few more days, if only to discover the truth behind the mystery of Pilou's parentage and the fire at the old chocolaterie. She finds out that her old adversary, Francis Reynaud, is about to lose his parish. A younger, trendier priest, P√®re Henri Lema√Ætre, has taken over his duties pending an inquiry into the arson attack, and Reynaud is unhappy and humiliated. Vianne promises to help him clear his name and regain his position. She moves into Armande's old house, now owned by Luc Clairmont, and begins to get to know the Moroccan community. She befriends one of the Muslim families, and slowly begins to earn their trust. Gradually she learns of the tensions that run beneath the surface; of family feuds; malicious rumours; political machinations and prejudices on both sides of the river. Behind all of these tensions stands the figure of In√®s Bencharki. But is she the cause of the unrest, or just another victim?  Themes  *Identity. The novel draws heavily on the theme of identity; of how we see others, how we judge on appearances and what we choose to reveal (or hide) about ourselves. In√®s wears the niqab both to hide and to reveal things about herself; she is judged, mistrusted and feared by some members of the non-Muslim community uniquely on the basis of what she wears. She says, in a Q & A with Red Magazine Online: \\"The new book became contemporary because of all the changes that France was undergoing at the time, and especially the debate about banning the niqab (the Islamic veil). It started me thinking once more about the themes of identity and alienation I'd already touched upon in previous books, and how I might revisit them in a different way.\\" *Tolerance/intolerance. A recurrent theme of Harris', the book describes aspects of cultural and religious intolerance within both the Muslim and the Catholic communities, whilst demonstrating how similar attitudes are in both camps. *Secrets and lies As in many of Harris' books, the main characters often have dark secrets to hide. The past is seen as an inescapable force that draws characters in and makes it hard for them to build satisfying relationships. *Food. Once more, as in Chocolat, Harris uses food as a metaphor both for tolerance and acceptance. It also serves as a means of entering another culture on a very basic level. In Harris' books, a gift of food is often an expression of affection, and Vianne's cooking (and her chocolates) serve as a means of breaking down inhibitions and inviting confidences. In an interview with the New Zealand Herald, she says: \\"It's like the first elementary contact. It doesn't necessarily offer a vast amount of understanding, but it's the first contact with a culture because it's something that everybody can understand. It's not like a language that you have to learn or a culture that you have to buy into. It's a simple way of offering or accepting hospitality. It's the first few stumbling phrases in something that will later become a dialogue.\\"  References  *The Joanne Harris website *Q and A with Joanne Harris *Interview: New Zealand Herald *Red online: Q & A with Joanne Harris *Interview with Joanne Harris (Herald Sun)  External links  *The Joanne Harris Website *Interview with Joanne Harris for HarperCollins *Review from the Independent English novels 2012 British novels Doubleday (publisher) books Fiction set in 2010 ","title":"Peaches for Monsieur le Cur√©"},{"id":"37033889","text":"Joel Dreibelbis Farm is a historic farm complex and national historic district located in Richmond Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania.

It is a complex of seven buildings designed by architect William D. Austin in the Shingle and Colonial Revival styles and built between 1899 and 1940. The site served as the headquarters of the State-managed Charles River Reservation and as horse stables for the Charles River Speedway, a harness and bicycle racing track along present-day Soldiers Field Road. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) maintains the Speedway Headquarters and considers it to be one of its origin properties. Vacant since 2005, the property is currently being redeveloped under DCR's Historic Curatorship Program by the Boston-based Architectural Heritage Foundation as a mixed-use commercial and cultural facility.  Architecture  The Speedway Headquarters was designed by local architect William D. Austin, known for his work on public buildings throughout Massachusetts, particularly in state parks and reservations. The complex consists of seven contiguous buildings arranged in a triangle around a courtyard. The buildings exhibit many features common to Shingle-style structures - wood shingle siding, an irregular roofline with cross-gables, turrets, and wide eaves - but also includes windows, shutters, and a portico with columns characteristic of Colonial Revival architecture.  History  The Speedway and its surrounding area were designed by landscape architect Charles Eliot shortly before his death in 1897, and its construction was overseen by the Olmsted Brothers. The Speedway operated until at least the 1950s, and was eventually absorbed by the expansion of Soldiers Field Road into a limited-access parkway. The buildings of the Speedway headquarters continued to be used by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for administrative and logistical purposes, through at least 2001. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 19, 2010, and as a Boston Landmark in 2014.\\"List of Designated Boston Landmarks in Numerical Order as of January 2014,\\" accessed June 6, 2019,https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/PETDESIG_JAN2014_tcm3-40308.pdf. The complex was vacant at that time. In April 2013 the Boston Landmarks Commission voted to designate the Charles River Speedway Administration Building, 1440 Soldiers Field Road, Brighton, as a Boston Landmark, under the provisions of Chapter 772 of the Acts of 1975, as amended. The designation was subsequently approved by the Mayor and by City Council.http://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/CRSAB_SR__final_revised_final_tcm3-39719.pdf  Redevelopment  In May 2013 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting by and through the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), announced a request for proposals from outside parties to rehabilitate, reuse, and maintain the Charles River Reservation Speedway Administration Building. The project was to be undertaken under the purview of the Historic Curatorship Program. In August 2014, the DCR announced that a proposal submitted by the non-profit Architectural Heritage Foundation and its for-profit partner, 243 Dutton Interests LLC, had been selected for a forty-year lease of the property. The chosen proposal will turn the run-down complex into a brewery/taproom, restaurant, maker space and retail shops for local artisans, and office space for a Brighton-based nonprofit. Initially, the proposal also included the construction of a multi-family housing unit in place of the adjacent 501-507 Western Ave. However, that plan has since been cancelled; the property has been demolished and will become a car and bicycle parking lot for Speedway Headquarters users. Today, 243 Dutton Interests is no longer participating in the project, and AHF is the exclusive redeveloper. Rehabilitation of the complex is expected to begin in Summer 2019, with an opening date scheduled for May 2020.

The buildings at 40 and 50 Terminal Street were built by the Terminal Wharf & Railroad Warehouse Company, and that at 267-281 Medford Street was built by the Terminal Storage Warehouse Company. They were built to serve as storage facilities for the transhipment by rail and ship of goods through the port. The buildings were vacated in 1984, and are being rehabilitated after many years of vacancy. In 2014, the warehouse at 267-281 Medford Street was renovated into apartments after a 17-year-long legal battle related to the building's location in the Terminal Storage Warehouse District and its proximity to the waterfront.

The district is bounded on the north by Middlesex Road, on the east by Reservoir Lane, on the south by Crafts Road and Massachusetts Route 9, and on the west by Dunster Road. A small portion of the district extends south of Route 9, including a few houses and the Baldwin School on Heath Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1985. The oldest portion of Chestnut Hill, including its colonial roots, lies just over the line in Newton, and was also the part of the village that was the first to be developed as a suburban residential area. When the Brookline section was being planned for development, Frederick Law Olmsted was consulted in 1888, but his plans were not executed. The area was developed between then and about 1920, with large, high-quality houses on well-proportioned lots. Most of the houses in the district are either Colonial Revival or Shingle in their styling; there are also a few earlier Queen Anne houses and a number of later Craftsman-style houses, especially in the Reservoir Lane area which was the last to be developed. Several prominent area architectural firms were engaged in the development of properties in the district.

The main building, a four-story Romanesque structure at 164 Terrace Street, was built that year by the Highland Spring Brewery. A second, five-story Georgian Revival building was added in 1912; this building was acquired in 1925 by the Oliver Ditson Company, a leading 19th century publisher of sheet music. The Highland Spring Brewery was founded in 1867 by a pair of immigrants, one Irish and the other German. The enterprise was a significant success, producing lagers, ales, and porters, and eventually gaining a nationwide reputation. In part for legal reasons, the two buildings built by the company (one for production, the other for storage and bottling) were connected by a tunnel and piping. The brewer ceased operations when Prohibition began in 1920. One of the company's brewmasters opened the Croft Brewery in the 1892 building in 1933 after Prohibition ended, the storage building having been sold to the Ditson Company and significantly altered for its use. Croft was acquired by Narragansett Brewing Company in the 1952, and operated on the premises for just one year before closing the plant and moving production to their Rhode Island Brewery until 1981 when it too closed. In 1958 the building at 164 Terrace St. was acquired local pickle maker R & S Pickle Works. The company produced kosher pickles in the building until the mid-1980s when the new owner Hebrew National closed the plant. 164 Terrace street remained unoccupied until 2008. The Ditson Company printed sheet music in the 1912 building at 154 Terrace street until 1931, when it was acquired by the Theodore Presser Company, which continued to operate there until the 1950s. Some time later the building was acquired by the Barb Corp and once again used as a printing plant operating as the Salem Press. Salem Press ceased operating in mid 1980s after which the building served as a warehouse for Graphique de France for the balance of the decade after which it remained vacant.

The area was developed in the mid-19th century by David Sears and Amos Adams Lawrence as a fashionable residential area, and retains a number of architecturally distinguished buildings, including the Longwood Towers complex at 20 Chapel Street, Christ's Church Longwood, and Church of Our Saviour, Brookline. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1978. Description and history Originally the property of CPT John Hull and Judith Quincy Hull. Judge Sewall came into possession of this tract, which embraced more than 350 acres, through Hannah Quincy Hull (Sewall) who was the Hull's only daughter. John Hull in his youth lived in Muddy River Hamlet, in a little house which stood near the Sears Memorial Church. Hull removed to Boston, where he amassed a large fortune for those days. Judge Sewall probably never lived on his Brookline estate. (http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/proceedings/1903/1903_Sewall.html) During the early colonial period, the Longwood area of eastern Brookline was part of the large farming estate of Samuel Sewall. Prior to 1850, it remained largely farmland, bisected only by Colchester Street. In the first half of the 19th century David Sears and Amos Lawrence, both prominent Boston businessmen, bought up large tracts of what had been Sewall's estate. The arrival of the Brookline Branch Railroad (now the MBTA Green Line \\"D\\" Branch) served as an impetus to develop the area more fully. Some of the houses built by Lawrence and Sears became homes to friends and business associates, but neither lived in the area. (Lawrence had a home in the Cottage Farm area just to the north across Beacon Street.) Sears was responsible for the construction of Christ's Church, Longwood, while Lawrence funded the construction of the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour, Brookline, two of the non-residential buildings in the district. The historic district is roughly triangular in shape, bounded on the east by St. Marys Street (on the town line with Boston) and on the west by Kent Street. It is bounded on the north by Beacon Street, but excludes buildings on the at street, and is bounded on the south by the MBTA right-of- way, which curves along the north bank of the Muddy River. The centerpiece of this area is Longwood Park, laid out by Sears, and its most prominent feature is the Longwood Towers, a group of Gothic Revival apartment towers built in the 1920s. Despite their large size, they do not detract from the older buildings that make up the bulk of the neighborhood. Most of the residences are Second Empire in style, with some Gothic elements, including one of the churches.

Description and history The Franklin County Fairgrounds are located southwest of downtown Greenfield, across the Green River on a high plateau. The property is over in size, ringed by public roadways that are relatively sparsely developed. Its largest feature is an oval racetrack occupying the southern portion of the grounds; the midway is located adjacent to the northern part of the track, while the permanent exhibition halls are in the northeast part of the property. The oldest building in the complex is called The Roundhouse; it is a two-story circular structure that is in diameter. It features a conical roof and novelty siding. The entrance gates were built in a Mission style in 1917. The exhibition halls are long rectangular single story buildings. Most of the buildings on the fairgrounds were built before 1955. The Franklin County Fair was established in 1848, and originally took place near the Greenfield town center. It was eventually crowded off that land by expansion of the town and the routing of the railroad across part of the grounds, and it moved further out in 1860. The present fairgrounds were established in 1865. The property originally included a racetrack, although in a different configuration; the present arrangement of that feature was made in 1895.

The district is focused on a two-mile stretch of Depot and Montague Roads, at whose center is the civic heart of the town. It includes the 1838 Greek Revival First Congregational Church, the town hall, whose present form was achieved in 1895 by raising the 1845 construction and building a first floor underneath it, and the Colonial Revival Field Memorial Library (1916). It also includes a town pound (a stone-walled pen for stray livestock) built c. 1822, and a number of 18th century residences. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Leverett was first settled in the late 17th century as part of Sunderland, and was separately incorporated in 1774. Its town center, located at the junction of Depot, Montague, and Shutesbury Roads, arose by the placement there of the community's first meeting house not long after incorporation. The oldest surviving residences in the center date to about 1750. Its single largest period of growth lasted until about 1830, which included construction of the town's first school c. 1800 (94 Depot Road), and the town pound. Modest growth continued in the mid-19th century, when a railroad line was run nearby. This provided the impetus for some small-scale industrial activity, evidence of which survives in a single modest wood-frame factory building.

A 19th century ell extends from the east side of the house. The house was built for Gardner Wilder, who had recently moved to the area, and had purchased to farm. The second contributing structure is a barn, whose construction was also begun by Gardner Wilder c. 1775. It was significantly enlarged with a full-height full-width extension in 1840, and a second extension, a 1.5 story equipment shed, was added in the 20th century. The oldest portion shows typical English colonial post and beam construction techniques, and its beams were axe-hewn, unlike those of the first addition, which show saw marks. The equipment shed was built using modern balloon framing methods.

A member of this group, Profallotaspis jakutensis, has long been the earliest known trilobite, but recently the redlichiid Lemdadella has been claimed as occurring even earlier.  Distribution  ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù occur in the Lower Cambrian of North America (Cordilleran region and northern Greenland), Europe (United Kingdom, Comley area; Ukraine), northwestern Africa and northern Asia (Siberia). = Dispersion of the ‚ÄúFallotaspidoidea‚Äù = Lieberman (2002) suggests that fallotaspidoids, the first hard-shelled trilobites (or Eutrilobites), originate in the paleocontinent Siberia. The group quickly spread to southern Europe and northwestern Africa, which were part of the margin of Gondwana (or Peri-Gondwana), and northwestern Laurentia. The sutured Redlichiina developed from the fallotaspidoids somewhere in Siberia and the Gondwana-margin, and from there spread to all of Gondwana, including current China and Australia, where fallotaspidoids and other Olenellina were absent. In Laurentia the Fallotaspidoids were succeeded by Nevadioids, Judomioids and Olenelloids, the latter remaining the dominant group of trilobites until the extinction of all Olenellina at the very end of the Lower Cambrian, after which Redlichiina, Ptychopariida and Corynexochida took over.  Taxonomy  The views of scholars on the relationships of the taxa now assigned to the ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù have changed regularly over the past half century or so. Initially, the Olenellidae, which also encompassed the subfamily Fallotaspidinae, was regarded the sistergroup of the Daguinaspididae, a view that made it into the Treatise of 1959.Moore, R.C. (ed.). Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Part O ‚Äì Arthropoda (Trilobitomorpha). 1959 Later, the genera now in the ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù were considered part of the Holmiinae, the sistergroup of the Olenellinae and the Nevadiinae.Schematic showing the relationships between the genera within the Fallotaspoidea and with other trilobites Bergstr√∂m recognized within the family Daguinaspididae five subfamilies: the Daguinaspidinae and the Fallotaspidinae (including Andalusiana, and Bradyfallotaspis), together comprising the current ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù, in addition to the Nevadiinae, the Neltneriinae and the Callaviniinae.Bergstrom, J., 1973. Classification of olenellid trilobites and some Balto-Scandian species. Norsk Geologisk Tidsskrift 53:283-314cited in Palmer and Repina, 1993 This was followed by the view that the Archaeaspididae (including Bradyfallotaspis), the Fallotaspididae and the Daguinaspididae were all families of their own and sistergroups of the Olenellidae, Homiidae, and Nevadiidae. Ahlberg et al., moved the Archaeaspis-group as a subfamily to the Callaviidae, leaving the Fallotaspis-group and the Daguinaspis-group as subfamilies in the Daguinaspididae. Palmer and Repina erected two superfamilies, the Olenelloidea and the Fallotaspidoidea, the latter consisting of the Fallotaspididae (comprising the Fallotaspidinae and the Daguinaspidinae), and the Archaeaspididae, next to the Nevadiidae, the Neltneriidae and the Judomiidae. This opinion was reflected in the Revised Treatise of 1997. Drawing of Eofallotaspis tioutensis from Morocco More recent cladistic analysis suggests that the ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù are the sister group of all other Olenellina (Judomiidoidea, Nevadiidoidea and Olenelloidea). The ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù remain paraphyletic (hence the quotation marks), even after reorganizing it, because it gave rise to the trilobites with dorsal sutures. Applying a strictly cladistic approach would call for including the ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù in the Redlichiina, and possibly raising the status of the remaining Olenellina to become an order (and be renamed to Olenellida). = Relations within the ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù = Repinaella is closest to the common ancestor with the other Olenellina. Second to split away is the Daguinaspididae-family, which comprises the closely knit group of Choubertella, Daguinaspis and Wolynaspis, with Eofallotaspis slightly further removed, and near the basis a subgroup consisting of Profallotaspis and Pelmanaspis. The monotypical family Fallotaspididae is next to branch-off. This is followed by the branch of Parafallotaspis all on its own, followed by the monotypical family Archaeaspididae. Finally Fallotaspidella is closest to the trilobites with dorsal cephalic sutures, such as Bigotina and Lemdadella. = Genera previously assigned to the ‚ÄùFallotaspidoidea‚Äù = Bradyfallotaspis fusa, Geraldinella corneiliana and Selindella gigantea, all have a long frontal glabellar lobe (L4), and eye ridges that contact only the posterior part of L4, and so these genera belong to the ‚ÄúNevadioidea‚Äú.  Description  As with most early trilobites, the Fallotaspidoidea have an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified, and has crescent-shaped eye ridges. As part of the Olenellina suborder, the Fallotaspidoidea lack dorsal sutures. The superfamily can be distinguished from all other Olenellina by features of the cephalon and in particular the glabella. The glabella tapers forward. The frontal lobe of the glabella (because it is counted from the back, it is numbered L4) is as long as the most backward lobe (L0), less than in the other Olenellina.

He is the lead singer for progressive metal band Queensr√øche, and a former lead vocalist of the bands Crimson Glory and Rising West. Originally from St. Petersburg, Florida, he learned to play the drums at a young age. Early life La Torre was born and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida in a musical family. His mother would take him to jazz and R&B; concerts of David Sanborn, Spyro Gyra, Lee Ritenour, George Benson and Al Jarreau, while his father introduced him to music of Earl Klugh, Steely Dan and Billy Joel. La Torre got his first drum set at the age of seven. At age 10, his mother got him a classical guitar, and he started taking guitar lessons. When he was 13 years old, his father got him a drum kit, and since the age of 14, he was involved in the local Tampa, Florida music scene as a member of the Seminole High School band and as drummer with local rock bands, playing hundreds of shows. He would also play some shows as an electric guitarist. Performing his own songs was limited to two local shows, where he would sing and play guitar. At that time, he recorded his own songs, playing the guitars, drums, bass and vocals himself. La Torre has always considered the guitar to be more of a songwriting tool for him. Career After graduation, La Torre made his living in the early 90s as a full-time musician as drummer for several bands in the Tampa Bay club circuit, including in the towns of Bradenton and Sarasota. The bands played hard rock and heavy metal, but some would also cover music of pop rock acts such as Matchbox Twenty and Natalie Imbruglia. He has recorded an album with one of these bands. Prior to becoming a full-time musician, La Torre was an upholsterer by trade, of twenty-something years, having owned an upholstery business for eighteen years. La Torre liked singing, and although he would usually sing backing vocals, he wasn't confident enough about his singing to be a lead vocalist. He would remain a drummer for 24 years, and says that: \\"my dream was always to be a famous rock drummer\\". His singing career first began when he became the lead vocalist for Crimson Glory at age 35, and later for Queensr√øche. However, in 2013, he stated: \\"I still feel like a drummer that likes to sing\\". =Crimson Glory (2010‚Äì2013)= La Torre was the lead singer for Florida metal band Crimson Glory from late 2010 to early 2013. In 2009, La Torre was considering forming an Iron Maiden tribute band. However, he was suggested to Crimson Glory guitarist Jon Drenning by their mutual friend, guitarist Matt LaPorte (Circle II Circle, Jon Oliva's Pain). La Torre first performed with the band as a guest vocalist at ProgPower X on September 12, 2009, and was formally announced by the band as their singer and frontman in May 2010, replacing vocalist Wade Black. Although he was never seeking out being the frontman of a band, \\"it just happened\\". His first official appearance with Crimson Glory was on October 30, 2010 at the Pathfinder Metal Fest in Marietta, Georgia. In November 2011, it was announced the band was working on a new album with La Torre. In February 2013, however, La Torre announced he had parted ways with Crimson Glory due to the band's inactivity. La Torre explained: \\"We had wonderful momentum and we were working within an important window of time within which the new record should have been recorded and released to have the most impact given the bands resurgence. Unfortunately, the record never materialized despite my best efforts, [and] I haven‚Äôt been contacted to write with Crimson Glory for over six months.\\" Despite his frustrations, La Torre does consider Crimson Glory to be \\"the catalyst that exposed me to the world as an undiscovered vocalist.\\" Although La Torre left Crimson Glory as his involvement with the progressive metal band Queensr√øche increased, he denies that the latter influenced his decision: > \\"I could show you emails from a year prior to ever even knowing [Queensr√øche > guitarist] Michael Wilton, saying I'm ready to quit the band. I have emails > to my bandmates saying 'what is going on? I'm not hearing from anyone.' We > were gonna start writing this record and things just started to fizzle out. > (...) it was like I was a race horse locked in a stable. I'm like, guys, I > wanna run. Queensr√øche is allowing me that and this feels good to me. The > guys in Queensr√øche never told me, hey, you're gonna have to decide here. > They never put that on me. They said, \\"If you think you can manage to do > both, okay.\\" I told them Crimson doesn't tour much and I wanted to finish > the record that we started to make, and I wanna do that. And to be honest > with you, it had nothing to do with Queensr√øche (...) [but] if everyone's > not working towards the same thing, then something has to change, and that's > why I quit.\\" =Rising West (2012)= La Torre and Queensr√øche guitarist Michael Wilton met at the buffet of a Seymour Duncan private dinner party during the NAMM Show in January 2012, where La Torre first mistook Wilton for Eric Peterson from the band Testament, complimenting him for a show that Peterson had played the night before at the Grove. After Wilton gave him a puzzled look, La Torre realized whom he was talking to, being a long-time fan of Queensr√øche. They ended up talking for a good hour at dinner, found out they had mutual interests in styles of music, and discussed the possibility of recording vocals on previously unreleased songs by Wilton for a TV sports reel and soundtracks. Wilton sent him four demos via email, and although he expected to get something back from La Torre in about 4 weeks, La Torre sent back the first demo with lyrics and a melody after only three days. Wilton was pleased with what he received. At that point, La Torre was not yet thinking about a career with Queensr√øche. He says: \\"It was just supposed to be about other stuff because I was completely focused and dedicated with Crimson Glory and we were writing an album, it took forever and never got finished. It was just a very slow process.\\" Because Queensr√øche's singer and frontman Geoff Tate was working on his solo album and an ensuing tour, Queensr√øche guitarist Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield were looking for a way to earn their own income by playing in a different band composition. Wilton explains that: \\"Originally this was deemed as a side project, because we were told by our management that we were not going to do anything for the next year so hey, we have to survive.\\" They decided to hold performances under the name Rising West (named after a lyric from the Queensr√øche album The Warning). Short of a frontman for Rising West, Wilton recommended La Torre to his bandmates. La Torre was asked if he knew any Queensr√øche songs, and it turned out he was very fond of Queensr√øche's older albums. Wilton said of the rehearsals with La Torre: \\"we blasted through 18 to 20 songs and everybody was amazed from the professionality, the musicianship and tone of Todd‚Äôs voice.\\" As La Torre was not very familiar with the songs on Promised Land and they had only limited time to prepare for the shows, the band focused on the material from the Queensr√øche EP to Empire, which are generally considered the band's heaviest releases, and according to La Torre: \\"are the songs and the time period that most represented the core sound of what Queensryche material was about\\". Rising West performed two sold out shows at Seattle's Hard Rock Cafe on June 8 and 9, 2012. =Queensr√øche (2012‚Äìcurrent)= La Torre performing at the Surf Ballroom with Queensr√øche in 2014 By the time La Torre performed with Rising West, differences between Tate and his bandmates in Queensr√øche led to Tate being dismissed from the band on June 5, 2012. (Exhibit E.) Several weeks later, Tate and his wife Susan filed a lawsuit against Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson, claiming Tate was illegally fired from the band.Queensr√øche Drummer: We Had 'No Choice But To Move On Without' Geoff Tate. Blabbermouth.net. Retrieved on 2012-09-16. The judge ruled in a preliminary injunction that both sides may use the name Queensr√øche until a verdict or settlement decided which party would ultimately be given the rights, after which Tate started his own band. It was revealed to the public on 28 April 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensr√øche trademark, officially making La Torre the lead singer of Queensr√øche in Tate's place. Although La Torre played with the band as Rising West, he was not privy to any information concerning tensions within the band at the time. Neither was he considering a career with Queensr√øche at that point, as he was primarily focused on Crimson Glory at the time: \\"[Rising West] was just a way to get out there and play stuff that they haven't played in a long time and hopefully be able to earn supplemental income until Queensr√øche was going back out.\\" Queensr√øche, however, were debating how they would carry on. According to La Torre, his eventual hiring was a \\"natural evolution\\", and he was therefore announced as the band's replacement singer at the same time it was publicly announced they had parted ways with Tate, continuing under the name Queensr√øche. In retrospect, he feels that he is a suitable candidate because Tate has been an inspiration to him, saying: \\"there's lots of guys that sing higher notes and maybe cleaner and could do it a little better that way, but I think that the subtleties and those little nuances that Geoff [Tate] was always so known for, was something that I just grasped at a very early age. And I think those characteristics are what kind of separates someone from being to able to hit notes, and someone being able to actually sell the song as a vocalist.\\" La Torre was actively involved with the songwriting for the self-titled album released in 2013 by writing the majority of the lyrics, several melodies, and some drum and guitar parts. He is more oriented to the heavier music, but finds it important to balance it out with music that \\"breathes\\" and builds up to a climax. Queensr√øche drummer Rockenfield calls La Torre a \\"fantastic drummer\\", and says that several drum parts La Torre suggested \\"were so good that I kept them and translated them into what I would do\\". La Torre is currently focused on being the band's singer and frontman, but he and Rockenfield have already discussed the possibility to also incorporate his drumming in live performances alongside Rockenfield, and interjecting their drumming. Queensr√øche guitarist Parker Lundgren sees La Torre as the reason the band has become much more oriented on the fans, saying: \\"[La Torre] would write back to every single email or Facebook message or anything he would get, even people criticizing him. He would always write back saying, 'I know where you're coming from...' He's always really cool to everybody. As far as actually meeting fans and getting back to them with emails and really caring, that's changed a ton just from Todd [La Torre] being in the band.\\" Of all the members in his version of Queensr√øche, La Torre has been most forthcoming about his views on the band Tate had formed while awaiting the verdict or settlement, saying: \\"I really feel that I am in the only version of Queensr√øche, even though there is another band out there touring. (...) I still have complete respect for Geoff [Tate] as a vocalist [and] he's got wonderful musicians that have accompanied him, but to call it Queensr√øche I think is a bit unfair.\\" La Torre says his other bandmates chose to take the high road and maintain a level of professional courtesy, even though \\"they could throw enough mud to build a Coliseum if they wanted, but they don't, and they don't have to\\". La Torre saw the cover art of Tate's version's album Frequency Unknown, which shows a fist and the abbreviation \\"F.U.\\", as a cheap shot that was below the belt, and feels that it is detrimental to the credibility and respect to the name and brand of Queensr√øche, because Queensr√øche was always more respectful and intelligent. Furthermore, he doesn't acknowledge it as a Queensr√øche album, because \\"[t]he guys that play on the record are not the guys that you see onstage and aren't the guys that wrote the songs.\\" Conversely, he finds that the self-titled album his version released \\"is completely indicative and representative that the guys in the band that I play in are in fact Queensr√øche, because it sounds like it.\\" In 2015, Queensr√øche released their second album with La Torre on vocals, Condition H√ºman. As of 2017, they are working on their third album, which La Torre has stated will include more uptempo songs. =Other projects= In 2009, La Torre and Matt LaPorte co-wrote the song \\"The Welcome Experience\\", which has so far only been released in demo form, and has not been revisited due to time constraints and LaPorte's death in 2011. Besides suggesting him to Crimson Glory, LaPorte also introduced La Torre to Jon Oliva (Savatage, Trans-Siberian Orchestra), who invited La Torre to sing backing vocals and play the hammered dulcimer on the 2010 Jon Oliva's Pain album Festival. In 2010, La Torre participated on the Rockstar Superstar Project music project. A musical endeavour created by legally named twins Rock Star and Super Star. La Torre contributed to the track \\"Do It For You\\", which also features Mark Slaughter on backing vocals and Bruce Kulick on guitar. In 2012 and 2013, La Torre was also writing material for his first solo album,Queensr√øche Singer Todd La Torre: Audio Snippet Of New Solo Track Available For Streaming. Blabbermouth.net. Retrieved on 2013-02-25. which reportedly includes guest appearances from other artists. La Torre is endorsed by M√©rida Guitars. In 2014, La Torre collaborated with former Megadeth guitarist Glen Drover on a single called \\"Discordia\\". In 2016, La Torre reunited with his former Crimson Glory bandmate Jeff Lords on the latter's current project Dark Matter, singing guest vocals on their sophomore release, Encipher. In 2017, La Torre announced that he was working on his long-awaited solo album, with his friend Craig Blackwell as co-songwriter, while simultaneously recording his third album with Queensr√øche. Later that year, La Torre collaborated with Metal Church on a new version of their song \\"Fake Healer\\" (originally from Blessing in Disguise). The song (studio version) was released on Metal Church's live album \\"Classic Live\\" (2017). La Torre also participated in the video that was made. In 2019, La Torre collaborated with Michael Sweet of Stryper and guitarist Andy James in Sweet's song \\"Son of Man\\", which will be on Sweet's upcoming album titled \\"Ten\\".\\"Son of Man\\" by Michael Sweet, Published by Rat Pak Records on 26 September 2019 via YouTube. Singing style La Torre's singing voice and style has been compared to that of Geoff Tate's in the 1980s and early 1990s. Commenting on his position in Queensr√øche, he has said: \\"I always try to honor what Geoff [Tate] did vocally. He was a huge inspiration, and I try to represent [Queensr√øche] to the best of my ability, but I also, you know, do put [in] a little bit of my flavor, which is a little edgier and a little grittier at times. And, you know, I try to be authentic but me at the same time.\\" He also considers Tate to be a legendary artist, who shaped \\"a certain unique defined sound that was very influential to me\\". He names Rob Halford, Ronnie James Dio, Geoff Tate, Bruce Dickinson and Jeff Scott Soto as the greatest examples of tenor vocalists, while he also likes to do growls and heavier singing in the style of Chuck Billy and Phil Anselmo.

Early life  Born in St Pancras, London, Davey was baptised on 17 January 1819 at St Pancras Old Church. He was the son of William Davey and Eliza Davey (formerly Lockyer), who were married in St Martin-in-the-Fields church on 14 September 1817; since a witness at the marriage was Elizabeth H. Turner, William may have been given his middle name of Turner after a relation or friend of that name. Davey was a pupil of the engraver Charles Rolls (1799-1885).  Career  It was Davey's reproductions of historical paintings which brought him to prominence: such as Eastward Ho! August 1857 by Henry Nelson O'Neil (showing British soldiers taking leave of their loved ones as they embark at Gravesend for India, in the wake of the Indian Mutiny), its companion Home Again, and the acclaimed large engraving in mixed mezzotint of Lady Butler's painting Return from Inkerman. He also exhibited 13 pieces at the Royal Academy between 1859 and 1884. Death of Lord Robert Manners, engraving by William Turner Davey after Thomas Stothard Among his many other works (a much fuller list appears in R. K. Engen's Dictionary of Victorian Engravers, Cambridge, 1979) are: *The Pytchley Hunt, (after William and Henry Barraud, 1852); *The Execution of the Marquis of Montrose (after Edward Matthew Ward, 1862); *Morning (after W. C. T. Dobson); *Keeper, a Good Dog in Old Times (after Landseer); *The Fathers of the Pack (after William Barraud); *Coming from the Fair (after Rosa Bonheur, 1876); *The Wynnstay Hunt (after Henry Calvert); *Autumn (after Alexander Johnston); *Little Red Riding Hood (after Charles Baxter); *The Casket (after Charles Baxter); *The Wounded Hound (after Richard Ansdell); *Deer Stalking (after Richard Ansdell); *Pull's Ferry, Norwich (oil painting, 1891)  Personal life  On 16 March 1840, Davey married Sarah Ann Barber at St John's Church in Holloway. They lived in north London until 1857 when they moved to Long Ditton, Surrey. William and Sarah had eight children, shown with them on the 1861 census in Portsmouth Road, Long Ditton. By 1871 William and Sarah had separated; Sarah is then living at 24 Andover Road, Hammersmith, with three of their children, while William is at 13 Mill Hill Terrace in Acton, Middlesex, living with another woman - Jane [Jane Law] - given as his 'wife'. From 1881 to 1888 William and Jane were living at 103 Mill Hill Road in Acton. By 1891 they had moved to 6 Florry Cottages in Ramsgate, Kent; William, then 72, is described in the census return as an 'artist, historical engraver/sculptor' and as being paralysed. One of his children: Frank Davey was a famous illustrator and photographer California and Hawaii. William Turner Davey died in Ramsgate on 25 July 1900, aged 81.  Bibliography  *R.

Early life and career While working as a tailor's apprentice to his father, Johann, and playing flute on the side, Johann Sedlatzek came to the attention of Count Franz von Oppersdorff, a nobleman of OberGlogau known for his intense love of music. Oppersdorff valued music so highly, in fact, that he would not hire any help who could not play a musical instrument.Rodda, Richard (2009).

The young tailor and budding flautist suited von Oppersdorff's requirements and soon was invited to study music formally with the musicians of the Royal Court of OberGlogau. By September 1806, the sixteen-year-old Sedlatzek had become a full member of the Royal Court Orchestra of Count Oppersdorff, affording Johann the opportunity to play for Ludwig van Beethoven during his visit to the Count's Castle that year with the orchestra's performance of Beethoven's own 2nd Symphony.Rodda, Richard (2009).

In March 1810, Sedlatzek left his family home to pursue his musical aspirations in Opava, the cultural heart of Silesia at the time, earning his living as Master Tailor while also working as a doorman at the local theater. He then traveled to Brno, Moravia and later to Vienna, Austria repeating this occupational strategy in each new city. Johann Sedlatzek was finally able to put aside the family trade and focus on music exclusively when he was hired as first flute to the \\"Theater an der Wien\\" in September 1812. A joint concert with the well-established Viennese musician Raphael Dressler in 1816 at Karntnertortheater, where Dressler was principal flautist, brought Johann to wider attention. The first printed review of a Sedlatzek performance appeared shortly after this event when the \\"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\\" gave the first of many positive reviews that would follow him throughout his long career in music. Sedlatzek joined the Vienna Society of Musicians (Tonk√ºnstler-Societ√§t) in 1817. That same year, after Dressler moved to London, Sedlatzek was chosen to replace the eminent performer as principal flautist at the Karntnertortheater, a position he would hold for the next eight years while also performing concerts in Germany, conducting a lengthy tour of Italy, and playing around Vienna with his own ensemble, the \\"Sedlatzek Harmonie Quintet\\".Hoeprich, Eric(2008).

Certain passages of Beethoven's score required the use of the particular Viennese flute which Sedlatzek was known to play with exceptional virtuosity. Only the Viennese flute was capable of playing as low as G, which was required for the proper interpretation of Beethoven's symphony. Other notable musicians who performed in the Vienna premier of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in 1824 included soprano Henriette Sontag, contralto Caroline Unger, tenor Anton Haizinger, and pianist Conradin Kreutzer. Among the violinists performing that evening were Joseph Bohm, Leopold Jansa, and Joseph Mayseder. In the wind section, playing along with Sedlatzek, were Karl Scholl, Joseph Friedlowsky, Wenzell Sedlak, Thobold Hurth, and Edward Levy. Beethoven, too hard of hearing at this point in his life to conduct, directed the presentation while Ignaz Schuppanzigh led the orchestra and Michael Umlauf conducted the whole.Kelly, Thomas Forrest(2000) \\"First Nights: Five Musical Premiers\\", Chapter 3, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Yale University Press, USA,2000. Tours of Austria, Germany, Swtitzerland, and Italy Between the years after his appointment as Principal Flautist at Karntentor Theater in 1817, and his performance with Beethoven in the premier of the 9th Symphony in 1824, Sedlatzek managed a busy schedule which included tours through Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, while also performing (by private subscription) in Vienna with his Harmonie Quintet. After his March 1818 performance with Carl Czerny in Vienna, Sedlatzek embarked on his first European tour as a featured performer. The first stop was in Zurich, where he performed with the pianist Johann Peter Pixiusem, prompting the \\"Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung\\" to write about the flautist \\"with great delight\\". In the summer of 1820, Sedlatzek performed in Prague. The Wiener Allgemeine Theaterzeitung wrote of this performance: \\"Sedlatzek captivated the audience with his variations on 'God Save the King' and captured the hearts of all!\\" Sedlatzek gave two shows in Berlin in July 1821. The first was to accompany Carl Maria von Weber. The second was as the featured player. Back in Vienna, 1 August 1821, Sedlatzek performed with cellist Vincez Schuster and pianist Karl Maria von Bocklet. Sedlatzek and Schuster performed together portions of \\"Schone Minke, op. 78\\". And, as a bonus, at the end of the show, Johann Sedlatzek performed publicly, for the first time, on the newly invented Viennese Flute with which he would become synonymous during his later career. Pope Pius VII for whom Sedlatzek performed in Rome during his tour of Italy in 1823. In 1822, Sedlatzek embarked on a two-year tour of Italy, which began with his performances to the Congress of Verona (where he performed for the Prussian King, Frederick William III), and continued through Sicily, Parma, Milan, Naples, and Genoa, where he performed alongside Niccol√≤ Paganini. The Gizetta di Miliano said Sedlatzek \\"captured his audience\\", and also noted that \\"even with Paganini performing in town, Sedlatzek's Halls were \\"bursting at the seams\\". In a letter to his parents, Johann wrote of his Italian tour and his stay in Sicily: :\\"Once again, as in every city, I have been enthusiastically received. I have meals each day with General Field Marshal, Graf von Wallmoden, and in the evening, I go to parties. My first show was a good one, but the second was unfortunately prevented by the terrible earthquake .\\" The Palermo earthquake of 5 March 1823 was the worst earthquake in the area of Sicily in the 19th century and one of the worst in Italy's history since such records have been kept. Sedlatzek left Sicily after the earthquake and traveled to Rome, where he performed for The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church at that time, Pope Pius VII. Sedlaczek and Ludlam's Cave Johann Sedlaczek is also listed as a member of the \\"Ludlamshohle\\" during the years between 1817 and 1826.Code name: Sedl Von Latzchek \\"Ludlamshohle\\" (translated as \\"Ludlam's Cave\\" or \\"Ludlam's Hell\\") was a secret-society of intellectuals, a select group of actors, singers, musicians, and scholars of Vienna, including Johann's contemporaries Karl Maria von Weber, Karl Gottfried, Friedrich Ziegler and some sources say Franz Schubert.Steblin, Rita (1998). Die Unsinnsgesellschaft: Franz Schubert, Leopold Kupeleieser und ihr Freundeskreis. Vienna: Bohlau, 1998. (. DM 99.) The \\"Nonsense Club\\" referenced in the title is often seen as synonymous with \\"Ludlam's Cave\\", however, as Steblin shows, these were two distinct groups. Schubert is known to have attended meetings of Ludlamshohle, but it is not clear if he was an official member. 19th-Century Vienna, where Johann Sedlatzek spent much of his musical career. The club was named after the Drama \\"Ludlam's Cave\\" by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschl√§ger (14 November 1779 ‚Äì 20 January 1850) and was also a reference to the dark, cave-like rooms in which the group typically met.The Ludlamshohle typically met at the Haidvogal Inn whose dark rooms gave a cavernous impression, citing Alice Hanson in \\"Musical Life in Biedermeir Vienna\\", 1985. Ludlamshohle was founded by the Austrian poet and dramatist, Ignaz Franz Castelli (6 March 1781 in ‚Äì 5 February 1862), house poet of Kartnertortheater from 1811 to 1814. While the society is consistently referred to as \\"secret\\", it was, in fact, well known to the public due to its large membership of prominent artists, even being written of in Vienna papers.Hanson, Alice (1985). Musical Life in Biedermeir Vienna. Cambridge University Press. May 2, 1985. \\"The Ludlashohle boasted the fellowship of Vienna's brightest artists, performers, and business men as well as prominent foreigners. So popular were the clubs meetings that in 1822 the Wiener Zeitung claimed that when tourists asked police about the whereabouts of certain Viennese celebrities, they were directed to the Ludlamshohle\\" Members claimed there was no devious or political intent to their meetings. Reports of attendeesRosenbaum, M.(1821). The Diary of Miss Rosenbaum. suggest the meetings were more akin to rowdy fraternity parties than dark rituals of sacred meaning or political intrigue. Nonetheless, the group's esoteric activities, strange symbolism, red and black color preference, and coded communications drew the suspicions of local authorities. A police raid was conducted during a meeting of Ludlamshohle held on 19 April 1826, founded on a charge no more specific than \\"sedition\\" in which manuscripts, artwork and money were confiscated, while many members were arrested. This action was largely ridiculed by the public as no evidence of espionage was ever uncovered in the subsequent trials.Hanson, Alice (1985). Musical Life in Biedermeir Vienna. Cambridge University Press. May 2, 1985. In the Chapter \\"Musicians and the Austrian Police\\". The group publicly dissolved after the raid, however, later writings indicate that certain members continued to meet secretly.Horste, Blake.

Austrians at that time were not allowed to travel outside of the country without special permission from the government. Travel for the sake of curiosity was not acceptable. \\"Need\\" had to be established. In the case of musicians, character and talent had to be proven. Johann traveled frequently, both during and after his involvement with \\"Ludlamshohle\\" indicating he was consistently in good standing with the Viennese authorities.Alice Hanson (1985). Musical Life in Biedermeir Vienna. Cambridge University Press. May 2, 1985.According to Hanson in \\"Musical Life in Biedermeier\\"(page 38), Vienna State archives contain several letters from musicians of that era including Johann Sedlaczek. In the letter, Sedlaczek requested permission to travel to London, which he did in 1826. Farewell to Vienna and a tour of Paris On 3 April 1825, Sedlatzek gave a farewell concert in Vienna at which he performed works from Beethoven and Rossini as well as his own compositions \\"Capriccio for Flute\\" and \\"Neue Variations for Flute\\", with the well-known Ignaz Schuppanzigh conducting. While Sedlatzek's farewell concert was held in April 1825, an entry in the Journal of the conductor Sir George Thomas Smart dated 11 September 1825 in which he describes a visit to Beethoven's home, shows that Sedlatzek remained in Vienna through the end of that year: :\\"... most of the company departed (after the performance), but Schlesinger invited me to stop and dine with the following party of ten. Beethoven, his nephew (Karl), Holz, Weiss, C. Czerny, who sat at the bottom of the table, Lincke, Jean Sedlatzek- a flute player who is coming to England next year and has letters from the Duke of Devonshire, Count St. Antonio, etc.- he has been to Italy- Schlesinger, Schuppanzigh, who sat at the top, and myself.\\" '' Beethoven, to whom Johann Sedlatzek was a friend and collaborator.

Sedlatzek, the well-known flautist and composer has arrived in London with his daughter, who is reported to possess considerable talent as a vocalist. Fraulein Sedlatzek has been very favorably received in Vienna and Amsterdam.\\"Novello, J. Alfredo (1854). The Musical World, Volume 32 #10. London: Boosey and Sons 1854. Page 179. Marie Sedlatzek soon became a performer of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane where reviews, at first, were mixed. One reviewer in the May 1854 issue of The Musical World said, \\"Mdlle. Sedlatzek acted well as Marcellina, (in a production of Beethoven's \\"Fidelio\\" ) but had scarcely voice enough for the part.\\"Novello, J. Alfredo (1854). The Musical World, Volume 32 #10. London: Boosey and Sons 1854. Page 340. However, a review from a month earlier in the April 29 edition of the same journal said of Marie (in a production of Weber's Freitschutz, starring Madame Caradori): :\\"Sedlatzek was recalled at the end with great enthusiasm ... (advancing) a step in public favor by the manner in which she sung the charming music of Annsehen and by the pretty and lively earnestness of her acting. She is young and inexperienced, but there is purpose in all she does.\\"Novello, J. Alfredo (1854). The Musical World, Volume 32 #10. London: Boosey and Sons 1854. Page 287.'' However mixed her initial reception may have been, Marie continued her career with the Royal Opera in London after her father returned to Vienna at the end of 1854. Marie eventually joined Theatre Royal, Dublin (Ireland), where she is frequently listed in the Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin as a performer there between 1855 and 1861.Levey, Richard Michael & O'Rourke, J. (1880) Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin: from its opening in 1821 to its destruction by fire in February 1880. J. Dollard, 1880. Later years and last days Aside from the tour of London in 1854 with his daughter Marie, Sedlatzek spent the last years of his life in his chosen homeland of Vienna, teaching flute, performing infrequent concerts,Neue Wiener Musik-Zeitung, Vol. 6 pg 79 (1857)\\"The Royal Esterhazy chamber virtuoso, Sir Johann Sedlaczek will give on 26 April (1857) a private musical performance in Bosendorfer Shen Salon (Vienna) ... with Georg Sedlaczek playing the Grand Sonata number 4 by Handel.\\" (translated from the original German) and training his children in music.Novello, J. Alfredo (1840). The Musical World, Volume 14. London: Boosey and Sons 1840. Johann Sedlatzek gave his final performance in 1865 to celebrate more than 50 years as a musician at B√∂sendorfer Salon in Vienna. In addition to the many prominent musicians who performed and paid tribute was his son Georg, the cellist. Johann Sedlatzek died on April 11, 1866 at the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna and was buried in W√§hringer KommunalfriedhoffWahringer Cemetery Records acquired from Stadt Wein Archiv 16 October 2012.

Sedlatzek and the Viennese flute Many of the reviews of Johann Sedlatzek's performances which appeared in London journals in the nineteenth century make special mention of the specific type of flute he played, showing a strong association between the musician and his instrument. Although the English writers consistently referred to his instrument as the \\"German\\" flute, it was actually Viennese.Wilson, Rick. 19th Century Viennese and Italian Simple System Flutes \\"http://www.oldflutes.com/viennese.htm#1825\\". Rick Wilson's Historical Flutes Page. Retrieved on 16 September 2012. The \\"Viennese\\" flute was the flute of Beethoven and Schubert's Vienna, playing important roles in some of their most famous compositions. Most notably constructed in the 1800s by the companies of Stephen Koch and Johann Zeigler of Vienna between 1807 and 1895, the Viennese flute was unusually long allowing additional keys for playing notes as low as the G below middle C, corresponding to the lowest note on the violin. To clarify, the Viennese flute was not the equivalent of the modern alto flute. This was a standard concert flute extended to provide a wider range, a fuller toned body of sound, and additional keys with fingering options not available on a shorter flute. The Royal Military Exhibition of Musical Instruments held in London in 1890 featured a large display of flutes of all varieties, including an 1827 model by Koch which the exhibition catalog identified as \\"once the property of the well-known Sedlatzek.\\" The catalog further describes the flute as being made \\"of ebony, with thirteen silver keys descending to the G of a violin.\\"Day, Charles Russell & Blaikley, James (1890). A Descriptive Catalogue of the Musical Instruments Recently Exhibited at the Royal Military Exhibition, London, 1890, page 40, item no. 88 on loan from the collection of Rudall, Carte and Co. Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1891. In spite of the potential scale of the instrument, the low G was rarely attempted as the design created a non-responsiveness in the lower register that made its lowest note extremely difficult to sufficiently intone. This technical flaw in the Viennese flute's design yielded a popular anecdote among flute enthusiasts involving Sedlatzek that has been often repeated: :\\"The low G very seldom came out successfully and when it did, Sedlatzek would stand the flute up in a corner and salute it with profound obeisance!\\"De Lorenzo, Leonardo (1992). The Complete Story of the Flute, page 275. Texas Tech University Press 15 January 1992. The story of Sedlatzek's \\"famous flute salute\\" is repeated with minor variations in numerous volumes concerning the history of flutes and flute culture with most authors citing Richard Rockstro as their source. The Viennese flute is not the only unique instrument Sedlatzek brought to British shores. During an 1831 concert in London, he introduced English audiences to the latest German musical innovation, the Accordion: :\\"At the close of the show, Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the accordion ... which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\\"The Times, London, page 5. 9 June 1831.The Court Journal, Volume 7 Saturday May 30, 1835 edition. Alabaster, Pasemore & Sons, Limited, 1835. \\"Sedlatzek accompanying the singer (Signor Brizzi) on a new instrument, the accordion\\" Performance and composition Much of the acclaim Sedlatzek received for his performances throughout his life was founded upon his speed and agility on the unusually long-scale Viennese flute, earning him the alias \\"the Paganini of Flute\\". The following commentary appeared in the \\"London Literary Gazette\\", 1827. :\\"Among the musical performers at present in London to whom we have listened with great pleasure ... we have to notice M. Sedlatzek of Vienna, whose execution on a newly invented German flute is of remarkable character and effect. The instrument is lengthened and has many additional keys, by means of which Mr. S. produces combinations hitherto unknown to (the Flute). His manner is rapid and his style is powerful.\\"Colburn, H.(1827). London Literary Gazette. Published by Gazette Proprietors, London, 1827. However, Sedlatzek seemed not to have been dismissed as a mere technician, as he was known to be an emotional performer who valued a powerful melody over mere virtuosity. The following review of a Sedlatzek concert held for charity in August 1828 appeared in the London musical journal \\"The Harmonicon\\": :\\"M. Sedlatzek does not deal in those miraculous passages which astonish all and please few: He therefore has no occasion to sacrifice the tone of his flute for the sake of being able to execute on it what was never intended for the instrument, but attends more to expression and cultivates a taste of a greater, if not more imposing kind ... He pleases while others surprise ... his sounds go more to the heart than to the head ...\\"Lee, Samual, publisher(1830) The Harmonicon, 1830 Part 1, pg. 307. Samuel Lee, London. Sedlatzek was also an admired composer and arranger. His most highly praised original composition was the \\"Souvenir du Simplon\\", (The London Gazette called it \\"delicious\\").Christmas, Augustus & Fitzclarenc (1834). The Literary Gazette Vol. 18, page 379. H. Colbrn, 1834. \\" We do not know when we have been more pleased than with Sedlatzek's 'Souvineer Du Simplon': It was delicious.\\" while his arrangement of \\"God Save the King\\" remained a crowd favorite throughout his career from the time of its first performance at an 1820 concert in Prague. A recording of eight of Beethoven's ten Sonatas by French musicians Alain Marion and Denis Pascal released in France in 1999 attempted to be an authentic reproduction of the original performances of these pieces as they are based on the personal transcriptions of the original musicians who performed them with Beethoven during his lifetime, including flute transcriptions from Johann Sedlatzek.Marion, Alain & Pascel, Denis- musicians (1999) \\"Beethoven- Huit sonates pour flute et piano\\".

Sedlatzek and Sedlaczek Research reveals several variations of the renowned musician's name. Johann's first name is given interchangeably in written literature as Johann, Johanna, Jean, John, and J. References to his last name alternate between the two spellings Sedlatzek and Sedlaczek.Also sometimes spelled \\"Sedlatzka\\". Sedlatzek (tz) is Johann's birthname originating in Silesia. However, due to Polonization of the region during his lifetime, the Polish spelling Sedlaczek (cz) was adopted in countries controlled by or strongly influenced by Poland. References to Johann in Vienna papers predominantly used the Polish \\"cz\\" spelling while most other areas of Europe used the \\"tz\\" spelling. Johann himself is known to have alternated between the two spellings in his own personal signature according to the culture and dialect of the country he was in at the time.Zduniak, Maria(1977). Przycznek do biograffi muzyka slasiego Johanna Sedlatzka, Muzyka, no. 1 as cited by Rowe in Situating Schubert. Zduniac notes in her biography that Johann, in signatures, posters, and press announcements, alternated between the two spellings of his surname throughout his career. 'Sedlaczek' is the polish spelling of the Silesian family name. Many direct descendants of Johann Sedlatzek ultimately adopted the Polish spelling \\"Sedlaczek\\" as his son, Georg, eventually settled in Vienna, and Johann's grandson, Ludwig Sedlaczek, was born in Vienna, where the \\"cz\\" spelling was preferred. Researching the life of Johann Sedlatzek requires searching under all of these variations. Polish and German biographies Oppersdorff Graf Wappen.

A more recent biographical article, \\"Johann Sedlatzek, the Paganini of flute from G≈Çog√≥wka\\", was posted on the Polish news website \\"nto.pl\\" on the 200th anniversary of his joining \\"Theater an der Wein\\" as Principal Flautist, his first job as a professional musician, in 1812. The article was posted on the site 12 September 2012 and featured a 20th-century photograph from a ceremony held in Oberglogau (Glogowek) in 1930 in which citizens of the town at that time posed for a re-enactment photo. Entitled \\"Farewell to the Apprentice\\", the scene depicted Johann's departure from his hometown in 1810 to pursue a career in music. An impersonator of Johann Sedlatzek, traveling bag in hand, stands at the center of the picture beside the Mayor of Oberglogau with a crowd of locals surrounding them. A hand-painted sign seen directly above the actor portraying the young tailor, reads: :'\\"Das Oberglogauer sendwert wunscht 1. Wandergesellen. Gute Reise!\\"' :(\\"Sending Best Wishes to the First Journeyman of Oberglogau. Have a good trip!\\") Sedlatzek and the 21st century The first live performance of Johann Sedlatzek's original compositions given in modern times occurred on 6 October 2012 at the 20th annual Silesian Music Festival in Poland, as reviewed in the article \\"Johann Sedlatzek: Master Flute, Found!\\" published on the Polish website Maestro.net on 9 November 2012.The Slaski Facebook page contains photos from this event.

Glogowek Online\\" posted 24 September 2012. The performance was to commemorate the release of the first ever sound recording of Sedlatzek originals ever produced.Wolenska, Elzbieta & Zawadzka, Elzbieta(2012) Johann Sedlatzek: Souvenir, sound recording (CD). JB Records, Wroclaw, Poland 2012. The flautist Wolenska had initiated her search for Sedlatzek Manuscripts after being inspired by stories told to her by the Glogowek Regional Museum Director, Alexander Devosges-Cuber, about the young tailor's apprentice from Glogowek whose advanced flute technique earned him the patronage of the Count von Oppersdorf, eventually allowing Johann to become one of the most famous flautists of the 19th century, often referred to as \\"The Paganini of Flute\\". A three-year search of archives across Europe yielded little result until, in the spring of 2012, Wolenska uncovered 300 pages worth of manuscripts in the London National Library. Upon returning to Glogowek with the manuscripts, Wolenska and Zawadzka began recording the lost music of Sedlatzek in July 2012, including the titles \\"Souvenir de Simplon\\", \\"La Marie\\", \\"Souvenir a Paganini\\", and \\"Amitie\\". The 80 minute CD entitled \\"Johann Sedlatzek: Souvenir\\" was released in Poland in the Autumn of 2012 on JBrecords. Maestro.net called the presentation \\"an historic event ... and a masterful performance.\\"Translated from the original Polish. Shortly after this world-premier performance of Sedlatzek's music at the Silisian Music Festival, the city of Glogowek, Joahnn's birth home, announced a public-works project on 31 October 2012 in conjunction with the Glogowek Regional Museum to restore the memory of Johann Sedlatzek as an important figure in the town's history.Poniatyszyn, Jan(2012)\\"G≈Çog√≥wek przypomina postaƒá Johanna Sedlatzka\\".

Her mean draught was 9 feet, and would reach 11.25 feet under full load. She had a displacement of 1,339 tons. She was propelled by three Yarrow-type water tube boilers powering Parsons geared steam turbines developing and driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of 34 knots. She was oil-fired and had a bunkerage of 320 to 370 tons. This gave a range of 3,500 nautical miles at 15 knots. She was armed with 4 QF Mk V L/45 guns in four single centre-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two forward and two aft in superimposed firing positions. She also carried one QF 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun aft of the second funnel. Aft of the 3-inch gun, she carried four 21-inch torpedo tubes mounted in pairs on the centre- line. History Valhalla was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 31 July 1917. She was deployed in home waters until the end of World War I. In the reorganization of the Royal Navy she was assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and given the pennant number D44. In the late 1920s she was placed in reserve at Rosyth. Disposition In 1931 she was stricken from the active list and scrapped.

The league had teams in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. In 2016, the league merged with the North American 3 Hockey League. History Precursors to the league were: * Interstate Junior Hockey League (1998‚Äì2004) * International Junior Hockey League (2005‚Äì2012) =Northern States Hockey League (2012‚Äì2014)= The Northern States Hockey League (NSHL) formed in spring 2012 and became the second league to be sanctioned by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and its United Hockey Union program. Several existing programs from the defunct International Junior Hockey League (IJHL) Super Elite Division joined new franchises to form a seven-team league. The initial teams included the Cape Cod Islanders, the Eastern Kodiaks, the Junior Mariners, the Lake George Fighting Spirit, the New England Stars, the Syracuse Stampede, and the Trenton Habs. For the 2013‚Äì14 season the league added the Maine Moose, the Maine Wild, and the Wilkes-Barre Miners. In addition, two teams relocated and changed names when the Lake George Fighting Spirit moved to Waterville Valley, New Hampshire and became known as American Hockey Institute Fighting Spirit and the Trenton Habs were renamed the Jersey Shore Wildcats when they moved their operations to Wall Township, New Jersey. The league also lost the Eastern Kodiaks when the team moved operations to Jamestown, New York, shortly before folding. The NSHL continued growth for the 2014‚Äì15 season when the league announced three new teams: the Roc City Royals, Central New York Stallions, and the Lockport Express. Two franchises also announced relocation and name change plans. The Maine Moose franchise was sold and renamed the Maine Timberwolves with a relocation to Lewiston, Maine, and the AHI Fighting Spirit was renamed the New Hampshire Fighting Spirit with a relocation to Laconia, New Hampshire. The league also organized the 12 teams into two divisions of six teams each. However, when the NSHL released its 2014‚Äì15 schedule in August, the CNY Stallions were not included in the schedule, reducing the west division to five teams and the league to eleven teams. On September 17, the Maine Timberwolves folded prior to the start of the season re-balancing the league to five teams per division. =North American 3 Eastern Hockey League (2014‚Äì2016)= In October 2014, the NSHL left the United Hockey Union after two seasons under the promise of USA Hockey sanctioning by affiliating with the Tier II Junior A North American Hockey League (NAHL) early into the 2014‚Äì15 season. Under the new organizational management by the NAHL, the league changed its name to the North American 3 Eastern Hockey League. Because the season had already started, the league would operate independently for the 2014‚Äì15 season and would apply to join USA Hockey before the 2015‚Äì16 season. The NA3EHL was approved for Tier III status by USA Hockey in May 2015. After the league was renamed, the Junior Mariners changed their name to the East Coast Minutemen while continuing to play out of Salem, New Hampshire. On December 16, 2014, it was announced that the Fighting Spirit would relocate once again for the following season to Lewiston, Maine and renamed as the L/A (Lewiston/Auburn) Fighting Spirit. On November 18, 2014, the NAHL announced it was adding the Skylands Kings junior hockey team for expansion to the NA3EHL beginning play in the 2015‚Äì16 season. On April 9, 2015, the NA3EHL announced the addition of the Northeast Generals as an expansion team to begin play the following season based out of Canton, Massachusetts. On April 13, 2015, it was announced the New York Aviators, the 2015 United States Premier Hockey League- Empire Division Champions, would be transferring to the NA3EHL starting in the 2015‚Äì16 season. On March 4, 2016, it was formally announced that the NA3EHL would be added to the North American Hockey League's other Tier III league, the North American 3 Hockey League (NA3HL), beginning with the 2016‚Äì17 season. The former NA3EHL teams became two new divisions within the NA3HL: the Coastal and Northeast.

Definitions Prohaska, Anderson and Binstock (2012) noted that the term social engagement is commonly used to refer to one's participation in the activities of a social group. The term has been defined by Avison, McLeod and Pescosolido (2007) as \\"the extent to which an individual participates in a broad range of social roles and relationships.\\" and by Zhang, Jiang, and Carroll as \\"the commitment of a member to stay in the group and interact with other members\\". Prohaska, Anderson and Binstock (2012) noted that the term has not always been used consistently in literature, and can be sometimes confused with several other similar (but distinct) concepts from social sciences. Social engagement is different from the concept of a social network, as social network focuses on a group, rather than the activity. They similarly note the difference between social engagement and social capital, the latter defined as \\"resources available to individuals and groups through their social connections to communities\\". Civic engagement is also different, as it refers to political activity, membership and volunteering in civil society organizations. Characteristics Social engagement is related to participation in collective activities, which reinforces social capital and social norms. Key elements of social engagement include activity (doing something), interaction (at least two people need to be involved in this activity), social exchange (the activity involves giving or receiving something from others), and lack of compulsion (there is no outside force forcing an individual to engage in the activity). For the most part, social engagement excludes activities for which one is getting paid, or family obligations. A common metric of social engagement is the quantifiable volume of activity. A traditional form of social engagement, such as church going, may be measured by the number of one's visits to the church. In the Internet setting a metric of social engagement on a discussion board may take the form of the number of posts made. One of the main topics in studying social engagement by social scientists has related to whether individuals are more or less engaged with various communities. Some studies have suggested that modern information and communication technologies have made it easier for individuals to become socially engaged in more distant or virtual communities, and thus have decreased their involvement in local communities (see also Bowling Alone). Promotion of positive behavior in and opportunities for social engagement also serve as key goals in the field of Positive Youth Development.  Health  High social engagement has been identified with improved happiness and health and well-being; however, context is important. High social engagement in deviant, delinquent activities such as membership in a criminal organization can be detrimental to one's health, as can be being too involved (having too many social roles), which can lead to stress due to conflicts between roles.  Social Engagement and Poverty  Poverty is a social problem that can greatly impact one‚Äôs ability to engage in the occupation of social participation. The World Federation of Occupational Therapists fully endorses the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Global conditions that threaten the right to occupation include poverty, disease, social discrimination, displacement, natural and man-made disasters and armed conflict. In addition, the right to occupation is subject to cultural beliefs and customs, local circumstances and institutional power and practices. WFOT strongly condemns any action or circumstance that infringes the rights of all human beings to live purposeful and engaged lives and to go about their daily business in safety and peace. Engagement in social activities can be impacted by an individual‚Äôs employment or the lack of it. Additionally, the global conditions to threaten the right to occupation have been addressed specifically for individuals with disabilities. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also highlights the requirement to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities. Articles 4‚Äì32 define the rights of persons with disabilities and the obligations of states parties towards them. Rights specific to this convention include the rights to accessibility including the information technology, the rights to live independently and be included in the community (Article 19), to personal mobility (article 20), habilitation and rehabilitation (Article 26), and to participation in political and public life, and cultural life, recreation and sport (Articles 29 and 30). In addition, parties to the Convention must raise awareness of the human rights of persons with disabilities (Article 8), and ensure access to roads, buildings, and information (Article 9). Poverty and limited access to the occupation of social participation is an occupational injustice. Occupational justice requires universal rights to occupation, broadly defined and recognising differences related to the cultural, social, political (current and historic) and geographical context. Occupational justice is the fulfilment of the right for all people to engage in the occupations they need to survive, define as meaningful, and that contribute positively to their own well-being and the wellbeing of their communities (WFOT, 2019). Occupational justice requires occupational rights for all to: ‚Ä¢ Participate in a range of occupations that support survival, health and well- being so that populations, communities, families and individuals can flourish and realise their potential, consistent with the Ottawa Charter ‚Ä¢ Choose occupations without pressure, force, coercion, or threats but with acknowledgement that with choice comes responsibility for other people, lifeforms and the planet ‚Ä¢ Freely engage in necessary and chosen occupations without risk to safety, human dignity or equity. = Areas of Work: Social Inclusion in United Nations = In all stages of policy formulation, social inclusion is critical to ensure that the needs of disadvantaged social groups such as indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, older persons, youth and women, are considered so that no one is left behind. UN DESA assists countries develop policies that address social vulnerability dimensions ‚Äì including gender, income group, and rural-urban disparities ‚Äì by training government to the use of new methodologies for data collection and mechanisms for the participation of all disadvantaged groups (United Nations, n.d.). Key tools to build capacity in the area of social inclusion include: * Provision of high-quality advisory services and technical expertise on social policy issues to governments and other relevant stakeholders, including through scoping missions, as well as analysis of existing legislative and policy frameworks in relation to relevant international instruments on social development; * Developing robust methodologies in capacity needs assessment, results-based management and monitoring and evaluation of social policies; * Methodologies for data collection on disadvantage social groups such as indigenous people, youth, women, older persons and persons with disabilities to facilitate evidence based policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and reporting; * Analysis of social impact and inequality (including income and rural urban inequalities); * Toolkit on Disability for Africa: its aim is to implement the Convention on the Rights for Persons with Disabilities.  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) by United Nations  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol was adopted on 13 December 2006 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, and was opened for signature on 30 March 2007. There were 82 signatories to the Convention, 44 signatories to the Optional Protocol, and 1 ratification of the Convention. This is the highest number of signatories in history to a UN Convention on its opening day. It is the first comprehensive human rights treaty of the 21st century and is the first human rights convention to be open for signature by regional integration organizations. The Convention entered into force on 3 May 2008. The Convention follows decades of work by the United Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons with disabilities. It takes to a new height the movement from viewing persons with disabilities as ‚Äúobjects‚Äù of charity, medical treatment and social protection towards viewing persons with disabilities as ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù with rights, who are capable of claiming those rights and making decisions for their lives based on their free and informed consent as well as being active members of society. The Convention is intended as a human rights instrument with an explicit, social development dimension. It adopts a broad categorization of persons with disabilities and reaffirms that all persons with all types of disabilities must enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It clarifies and qualifies how all categories of rights apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adaptations have to be made for persons with disabilities to effectively exercise their rights and areas where their rights have been violated, and where protection of rights must be reinforced. The Convention was negotiated during eight sessions of an Ad Hoc Committee of the General Assembly from 2002 to 2006, making it the fastest negotiated human rights treaty. https://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/convention/convention_accessible_pdf.pdf  Occupational Therapy and Social Engagement  Occupational therapy is a client-centred health profession concerned with promoting health and well being through occupation. The primary goal of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in the activities of everyday life. Occupational therapists achieve this outcome by working with people and communities to enhance their ability to engage in the occupations they want to, need to, or are expected to do, or by modifying the occupation or the environment to better support their occupational engagement (WFOT 2012). Occupational therapists work in a variety of settings, and focus on occupation through an individualized client-centered approach, which may include supporting individual participation in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation (Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain & Process).  Community Based Rehabilitation by WFOT  This position implies that occupational therapists engage in coalitions with people who experience disabilities, their families and communities, advocating with them and for their issues, sharing individual experiences and enabling professional organizations to support people with disabilities' social engagement needs and rights of dignity and inclusion, in both developing and developed societies. WFOT recognizes that there is a wide range of opinions and philosophies about what community based rehabilitation (CBR) actually is or what it should be. CBR can cover very diverse disability related practices. This paper is based on the understanding of CBR as a strategy within community development for the rehabilitation, equalization of opportunities and social integration of people with disabilities. Occupational therapists are developing a critical awareness and understanding about these realities, guided and informed by new notions, such as occupational apartheid occupational deprivation and occupational justice. Occupational therapists are committed to advance certain core principles, one of which is the right of all people-including people with disabilities-to develop their capacity and power to construct their own destiny through occupation, which seems congruent with the basic tenets of CBR. practice-research-education projects in CBR.

It was released through Sweet FA, an imprint of Safari Records. The single's B-side was \\"On the Crest\\". Playing piano on the record was Jools Holland, then a session musician in his late-teens. Described as \\"trashy, New York Dolls- influenced punk rock\\", the song was included in the book X-Rated: The 200 Rudest Records Ever! Overview The song begins with a boogie woogie feel, with the piano part played by a then-unknown Jools Holland. Toward the end of the song, however, the style changes to a punk rock style with a double-time feel. In his 2007 autobiography, Barefaced Lies and Boogie-woogie Boasts, Holland describes that on arriving at the recording session at Marquee Studios in London, he discovered that the group had recorded a backing track for the song but had written no lyrics. County asked him to play \\"really burlesque\\". Holland wrote that the first time he heard the song's lyrics was when playing the record to his mother, his younger brothers, and his aunt and uncle. Background The song was written when Wayne County's band were still known as The Backstreet Boys.Not to be confused with the 1990s boy band of the same name AllMusic describes the lyrics as County's way of \\"chastising those who won't take [her] home\\". Originally titled \\"(If You Don't Want to Fuck Me, Baby) Fuck Off\\", the song was planned to be released on the group's d√©but album. The album was never released, though some tracks were included on 1976's Max's Kansas City. The following year the band renamed themselves as \\"The Electric Chairs\\" and the song was included on the 1977 album Man Enough to Be a Woman and the following year's Blatantly Offenzive. A dance remix of the song was released in the 1990s, remixed by Sleazesisters (DJ Pete Martine and Porl Young. A bootleg dance version - Fuck Off Sucker - was released as a white label in 2010 by That Queer Geezer, juxtaposing Jayne County's vocals over the instrumental of 90s dance anthem Hold That Sucker Down.

Gibbs, founding proprietor of the St James's Gazette. Miniature portrait by Magdalena Ross (1801‚Äì1874)Christie's sale 6572, lot 203 The St James's Gazette was a London evening newspaper published from 1880 to 1905. It was founded by the Conservative Henry Hucks Gibbs, later Baron Aldenham, a director of the Bank of England 1853‚Äì1901 and its governor 1875‚Äì1877; the paper's first editor was Frederick Greenwood, previously the editor of the Conservative-leaning Pall Mall Gazette. The St James's Gazette was bought by Edward Steinkopff, founder of the Apollinaris mineral water company, in 1888. Greenwood left, to be succeeded by Sidney Low (1888‚Äì97), Hugh Chisholm (1897‚Äì99) and Ronald McNeill (1900‚Äì1904). Steinkopff sold the paper to C. Arthur Pearson in 1903, who merged it with the Evening Standard in March 1905, ending the paper's daily publication. A weekly digest of the paper, the St James's Budget, appeared from 3 July 1880 until 3 February 1911. History =Background= The St. James's Gazette was founded in 1880 out of the Pall Mall Gazette, which was (in the phrase of Leslie Stephen, the father of Virginia Woolf) \\"the most thorough-going of Jingo newspapers.\\" The Pall Mall was owned by George Smith of Smith, Elder & Co., who founded the world-famous Apollinaris mineral water firm with Edward Steinkopff in 1874. In April 1880 Smith (who later founded the Dictionary of National Biography) handed control of the Pall Mall Gazette to his new son-in-law Henry Yates Thompson who, with his editor John Morley (later Viscount Morley), determined to turn it into a radical Liberal paper. In order to continue his advocacy of the old policy of the Pall Mall, H. H. GibbsGibbs, director of the Bank of England was a Conservative merchant banker and a member of Antony Gibbs & Sons, a firm of merchant traders. His uncle's firm Gibbs Bright & Co. (of Bristol & Liverpool) had been previously involved in the West African slave trade to their Caribbean sugar plantations and acted as shipping agents for Brunel's SS Great Britain; the firm was latterly involved in the guano fertiliser trade with the Bolivian & Peruvian governments and later in the sodium nitrate trade (needed for munitions) in Chile. founded the St James's Gazette, taking Greenwood and the Pall Mall's entire staff; the first issue appeared on 31 May 1880. =Publication= \\"He created The Pall Mall Gazette\\" Caricature of Frederick Greenwood by 'Ape' (Carlo Pellegrini) in Vanity Fair, June 1880 In the new paper Frederick Greenwood fought for the same cause with the same spirit and capacity as in the old. He powerfully advocated the occupation of Egypt in 1882, and was the whole-hearted opponent of the Irish nationalists. One occasional contributor to this 'strongest of Tory voices' was the critic George Saintsbury. No newspaper helped more effectively to destroy W. E. Gladstone's power and to prepare the way for the long predominance of the Liberal Unionist Party. But various causes, of which the strongest was the decline of a taste for serious journalism in the public, rendered it impossible for the St. James's to attain to the prosperity of the Pall Mall. After the death of one of the proprietors, George Gibbs, on 26 Nov. 1886 the financial control passed to his cousin Henry Gibbs, who was not equally in harmony with Greenwood's views. In 1888 Greenwood persuaded Edward Steinkopff (still in the Apollinaris business with George Smith, the ex- proprietor of the Pall Mall Gazette) to buy the St. James's. But the new proprietor refused his editor the freedom he had so far enjoyed; and Greenwood retired suddenly and in anger within the year, to be succeeded by Sidney Low. St James's Gazette was one of the earliest supporters of the Imperialist movement, and between 1895 and 1899 was the chief advocate in the Press of resistance to the foreign bounties on sugar which disadvantaged British trade with the West Indies, thus giving an early impetus to the movement for Tariff Reform, and to Colonial or Imperial Preference. Hugh Chisholm in 1903 Hugh Chisholm joined the St James's Gazette as assistant editor in 1892 and was appointed editor in 1897. In the same year the paper's proprietor Edward Steinkopff sold the massively successful Apollinaris business to the restaurateur and hotelier Frederick Gordon, receiving ¬£1,500,000 as his share.\\"London, 2 March 1906. Mr. Edward Steinkopff, who received ¬£1,500,000 as his share of the Apollonaris business which he helped to found, died [in Feb. 1906] at Hayward's Heath.\\" Frederick Gordon owned numerous hotels in London & the UK, and turned Bentley Priory into a hotel. Source: During these years, Chisholm also contributed numerous articles on political, financial and literary subjects to the weekly journals and monthly reviews, becoming well known as a literary critic and Conservative publicist. The paper appealed to and influenced a comparatively small circle of cultured readers, a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù function more and more difficult to reconcile with business considerations. During the years immediately following 1892, when the Pall Mall Gazette again became Conservative, the competition between Conservative evening papers became acute, because The Globe and Evening Standard were also penny Conservative journals; and it was increasingly difficult to carry on the St James's on its old lines so as to secure a profit to the proprietor; by degrees modifications were made in the general character of the paper, with a view to its containing more news and less purely literary matter. But it retained its original shape, with sixteen (after 1897, twenty) small pages, a form which the Pall Mall had abandoned in 1892. A number of well-known writers had pieces or short stories published in the Gazette, including Thomas Hardy ('The Grave by the Handpost', Christmas number, November 1897); Kenneth Grahame ('A Bohemian in Exile', the first of the Pagan Papers); Andrew Lang's 'Old Friends', a series of parodic essays in the form of imagined letters between fictional characters; P. G. Wodehouse (three articles from 1902-3) and Oscar Wilde ('Mr. Oscar Wilde on Mr. Oscar Wilde', 18 January 1895). Ronald McNeill Chisholm moved in 1899 to The Standard as chief leader-writer. His place on the St. James's Gazette was taken in 1900 by the Irish barrister Ronald McNeill, (later Baron Cushendun).Chisholm became editor-in-chief of the 11th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in 1903, with McNeill as assistant editor from 1906 to 1910 Eric Parker (editor of The Field from 1911 until 1932) also worked there.In his book Memory Looks Forward (1937) Parker recounted his memories of journalism beginning with the St. James's Gazette under Ronald McNeill, afterwards Lord Cushendun.

The atmosphere and the methods described have almost passed away. Such papers as the St. James's Gazette, the Globe and the Westminster Gazette were conducted by small thinking and writing staffs who, working anonymously, were ready to accept a collective credit or discredit. The well-known exaggeration that the influence of a paper is in inverse ratio to its circulation might have been invented for them ‚Äî particularly for the Westminster Gazette.\\" One of the concerns in Britain around the turn of the century was immigration into the UK, prompted partially by the Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire One of the most vociferous and outspoken anti-alien critics of the day was Major William Evans-Gordon, MP for Stepney, whose \\"restrictionist\\" rabble-rousing activities with the British Brothers League led to the Aliens Act 1905. Evans-Gordon's 1903 book The Alien Immigrant on the plight of Jewish and other (undesirable, in his view) immigrants was dedicated \\"To my friend, Edward Steinkopff\\", the owner of the St James's Gazette. Steinkopff's only child, Mary Margaret Steinkopff, married Evans-Gordon's brother-in-law, Col. James Stewart-Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth. St James's Budget Starting on 3 July 1880, a weekly digest of the Gazette, including the main literary pieces and a summary of the week's news, was published as the St James's Budget. After 1893 it was turned into an independent illustrated weekly, edited from the same office by James Penderel- Brodhurst (later editor of The Guardian from 1905), who had been on the editorial staff since 1888; and it continued to be published till 1899 or until 1911. Amalgamation Tariff Reform League poster with Joseph Chamberlain C. Arthur Pearson (later described by Winston Churchill as \\"the champion hustler of the Tariff Reform League\\") had had a financial interest in the St. James's Gazette for several years. When the Tariff Reform battle started Pearson was the head of a syndicate which bought the morning Standard newspaper in 1904 for ¬£300,000. With the acquisition went the London Evening Standard, which published every day a full list of Stock Exchange prices and was largely purchased on that account. Steinkopff sold the St. James's Gazette (or a controlling interest in it) to Pearson in 1903, who amalgamated it with the Evening Standard on 13 March 1905; the Gazette ceased publication thereafter.

Willis Avenue on the north. History The area known as the Pinch District was part of the original plan of Memphis, and emerged as the city's first commercial area. It was originally located north of Market Street and south of the Bayou Gayoso, a stream that ran through (now under) downtown Memphis. The name \\"Pinch\\" was originally a derisive term, referring to emaciated Irish immigrants who fled the Great Famine in the 1840s. The area was known as Pinch-Gut, in reference to the starving look of many of its impoverished residents. It was home to the earliest immigrant communities in Memphis, mainly Irish, Italian, Russian, Greek, and Jewish. From the 1890s to the 1930s, it was the center of Memphis' Jewish community, with many synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses. After World War II many of the area's residents moved to the eastern suburbs, and businesses began closing. The area became predominantly African-American, and remains so today. During the 1970s, the Pinch was a target of slum clearance and urban renewal. The Barry Homes housing project was constructed in the Pinch in 1970, and the neighborhood was bisected by Interstate 40 as part of the construction of the Hernando de Soto Bridge in 1973. =Gentrification= In 1991, the City of Memphis constructed the Pyramid Arena along the Wolf River lagoon. Initial prospects of turning the area into a new entertainment district diminished by the late 1990s. With the arrival of an NBA franchise, the Memphis Grizzlies, the fate of the Pyramid became grim as a new arena was constructed near Beale Street on the southern side of downtown. Both the Grizzlies and the University of Memphis moved their home games to the FedEx Forum in 2004, and the Pyramid closed as an arena. Several proposals for new development were devised in the mid-2000s, though many never materialized. Recent development has centered on MATA's North End Terminal, which operates as the city's main bus terminal. The Pyramid now has been converted into a Bass Pro Shops megastore opened in May 2015, a hint that gentrification may be returning to the struggling neighborhood. In 2016, conceptual plans for revitalizing the Pinch District were announced. The design calls for a mixed-used district that would complement a $1 billion expansion of St. Jude. New research and office buildings will be located outside the existing St. Jude gates and will have public-facing retail and restaurant tenants at ground level. Additional mixed- use buildings would provide a mix of office, residential, and hotel space. A long-awaited pedestrian bridge to connect the Pyramid to the greater Pinch District is also planned.
