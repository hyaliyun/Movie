The species is known from the late Eocene sediments exposed in the state of Oregon in the US. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Macrantha. History and classification Acer clarnoense is represented by a series of fossil specimens which were recovered from late Eocene, Priabonian stage, outcrops of the lower John Day Formation which outcrops at the Teater Road locality, also known as the Sheep Rock Creek flora. This site, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry site number 256, was originally included by Wolfe and Tanai in the older Clarno Formation, which underlies the John Day formation. This placement was based on floral similarities between the plant species at the Teater Road site and dated sites of the Clarno formation. The placement of the site in the Clarno Formation was accepted until 2007 when white ash deposits at the base of the Teater road outcrop were dated using Argon‚Äìargon dating analyses. A series of twenty-six sanidine crystals taken from the white ash tuff were dated with an average age of which is younger than the ignimbrite at the base of the John Day Formation. The species was described from a group of type specimens, the holotype leaf specimen UCMP 9010A, B, and three paratype leaves, specimens UCMP 9011, UCMP 9012, and UCMP 9013. The fourth paratype, UCMP 9014 is a single complete samara specimen. All of the type specimens are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, in Berkeley, California. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. clarnoense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name clarnoense is in recognition of the Clarno Formation to which the type locality was thought to belong when the species was described. Description Leaves of Acer clarnoense are simple in structure and generally widely ovate in shape, with perfectly actinodromous vein structure in which the primary veins originate at the base of the lamina and run out towards the margin. The leaves are shallowly three-lobed with the lateral lobes being about one half as long as the median lobe and all lobes being a rounded triangular in outline. The leaves have five primary veins and range between long by wide in overall dimensions. The overall morphology of A. clarnoense suggests placement into the Acer section Macrantha. This is based on the shallow lobing with the lobes having acute bracing formed from the forking of secondary veins. The veins also produce areoles with a distinct polygonal outline and range from in diameter. The samaras of A. clarnoense have a flattened nutlet with six veins running from the attachment scar across the nutlet, forming a reticulated vein pattern, and into the wing. The overall shape of the nutlet is triangular with the length of the samara up to and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a 60¬∞ attachment angle wing extending slightly along the underside of the nutlet.

It is located at 198 Ferdowsi Avenue in Tehran. Following the 2011 attack on the Embassy and the expulsion of the British ambassador by Iran, Britain reduced its diplomatic relations with Iran to \\"the lowest possible level\\" and closed its embassy. However, following the election of President Hassan Rouhani, relations improved and both countries appointed non-resident charge d'affaires to conduct bilateral relations between London and Tehran. The embassy reopened in August 2015 and relations were upgraded in 2016, with relations now conducted once again by an ambassador. The current ambassador to Iran is Robert Macaire. History The British Mission in Tehran was first established in 1821 in the Old Bazaar. By the 1860s, the overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions forced the government to look for a more suitable location and the Ferdowsi site was purchased. To supervise the construction of the new Legation Buildings, James Wild, the architect, was commissioned. He was an established architect with experience of the Middle East. The building was finished in June 1876. Persian Constitutional Revolution Bast at British Embassy, 1906 Most famous of all the historical events associated with the embassy is the great 'bast' (meaning sanctuary) of July/August 1906 when, during the constitutional struggle, some 12-16,000 Tehranis took sanctuary in the compound and by thus paralysing the life of the city, forced Muzaffar-ud-din Shah to issue his celebrated Farman of 5 August 1906 granting the people a constitution and National Assembly. Iranian Revolution Following the Islamic revolution in 1979, the British Embassy was placed under the protection of Sweden. In 1981 the name of the street housing the embassy was changed from 'Winston Churchill Street' to 'Bobby Sands Street' after IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.Britain's embassy in Iran is reopening ‚Äì but how long will it last this time?, The Guardian, 17 June 2014Britain to reopen embassy in Iran on Bobby Sands Street, Belfast Telegraph, August 20 2015 In 1987, all staff were withdrawn from Tehran following a series of setbacks to relations. In November 1988, the UK's Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe agreed with Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati to resume diplomatic contact. Staff returned in January 1989. The Satanic Verses controversy On 14 February 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie and his publishers. European Community Foreign Ministers agreed to withdraw their heads of mission from Tehran in response. The British Government withdrew all UK-based staff. Iraq‚Äôs invasion of Kuwait made it desirable to re-establish relations once more, in September 1990. Mykonos restaurant assassinations The UK and all other EU countries withdrew their heads of mission in April 1997 when a German court issued a verdict that members of the Iranian intelligence services were responsible for the murder of four Iranian Kurds in Germany in 1992. Heads of mission returned in November 1997 following the election of President Khatami, who showed determination to pursue the establishment of a civil society and the rule of law, and to promote wider international understanding. Britain and Iran jointly upgraded the relationship to ambassadorial status in 1999. 2011 British Embassy stormed Closed embassy in 2015 On 29 November 2011, two compounds of the British embassy in Tehran were stormed by Iranian protesters. The protesters smashed windows, ransacked offices, set fire to government documents, and burned a British flag. The storming of the British embassy followed from the 2011 joint American-British-Canadian sanctions and the Iranian government's Guardian Council approving a parliamentary bill expelling the British ambassador as a result of those sanctions. A British flag was taken down and replaced by the Iranian flag by the protesters. The British Foreign Office responded by saying \\"We are outraged by this. It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it.\\" According to Iranian state news agencies, the protesters were largely composed of young adults. On 30 November 2011, in response to the attack, the UK closed its embassy in Tehran and ordered the Iranian embassy in London closed. In order to continue providing consular assistance to British citizens in Iran, the UK appointed Sweden as a protecting power; Iran similarly appointed Oman as its protecting power in London. Reestablishment of relations In July 2013, it was announced that the UK would consider to open better relations with Iran \\"step-by-step\\" following the election of President Hassan Rouhani. In November 2013, Iran and the UK agreed to end the protecting power arrangements of Sweden and Oman and appointed non-resident charge d'affaires to conduct bilateral relations between London and Tehran. In June 2014, the UK announced that it intended to reopen its embassy in Tehran once practical arrangements had been completed and predicted that Iran would reopen its embassy in London. In August 2015, the embassy was reopened by Philip Hammond, the British Foreign Secretary. The embassy continued to be managed by a charge d'affaires until 2016, when the then-incumbent Nicholas Hopton was promoted to ambassador.  Arrest of Ambassador  On 11 January 2020, the British Ambassador to Iran Robert Macaire was arrested in Iran before being released shortly after. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the events as a \\"flagrant violation of international law\\". Gholhak Garden Embassy in 1920 Gholhak Garden (alternatively Qolhak Garden or Gulhak Garden) is a British diplomatic compound in the northern Tehran neighborhood of Gholhak in Iran, about 3 miles from the centre of Tehran. The sprawling tree-lined site, bordered by high walls, measures 200,000-square- metre (50 acres) and houses British diplomats and their families. The compound is also home to the Tehran War Cemetery. The site has been at the centre of diplomatic controversy between Britain and Iran over ownership and management of the grounds. The Qajar monarchy gave the land for Gholhak Garden to the United Kingdom in the 19th century during the height of the British Empire for their ambassador to use as a summer residence. Gholhak Garden is separate from the historic British embassy several miles south in central Tehran, where British ambassadors have now lived for decades. Today, several British diplomats and their families as well as some Iranian embassy staff reside in the Gholhak complex. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which has had strained relations with the United Kingdom, has on occasion demanded the return of the Gholhak property to Iran. Gholhak Garden and the British embassy in central Tehran have been subject to periodic anti-Western demonstrations orchestrated by the Iranian government since the defunct American embassy has no longer been the central target after being taken over in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis. On November 29, 2011, Iranian protesters stormed the British embassy in downtown Tehran and Gholhak Garden. The incident came amid rising tensions over Iran's nuclear program. The protesters broke into Gholhak and briefly seized six British embassy staff before being released by the Iranian police.

It is based on the 1954 novel by William March and is a remake of the 1956 movie directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Synopsis Freak fatal accidents force a widow to realize her precocious 9-year-old daughter was born to kill. Plot Rachel Penmark is a young girl who is upset at not winning a penmanship medal at school, having lost to her classmate Mark Daigler. During a school trip to the beach, Rachel tries to get Mark to give her the medal, he refuses and she chases him onto a fishing pier. Teacher, Alice Fern, notices Mark is missing during a roll call. They organize into search teams to look for him. When he is found, unsuccessful attempts are made to revive him on the shore near the pier, and the death is ruled as an accidental drowning. Rachel's mother, Christine Penmark, is discussing all of the deaths Rachel has seen with neighbors Monica and Emory Breedlove. Rachel saw the TV news reports about her father's death. Christine recalls the death of a neighbor, Mrs. Post, who adored Rachel, in an accidental fall down some stairs. Christine worries when Rachel appears to be unaffected by Mark's death. Monica and Emory assure her that this is normal because children have a defense mechanism to process these things. Christine asks Emory about a book he's writing about a female serial killer. Emory mentions a name and case of a serial killer, Bessie Danker, that Christine's father, Richard Bravo, worked on years earlier and the name seems to resonate with Christine. Rachel is outside playing when the maintenance man, Leroy Jessup, mentions that she doesn't seem sorry about Mark's death, to which she replies, \\"Why should I feel sorry? He's the one that's dead.\\" Christine goes to meet with Ms. Fern to discuss something important. Ms. Fern says that Rachel may finish out the remainder of the current school term, but that she will not be welcomed back next semester, to The Fern Academy due to concerns about her behavior. Ms. Fern says others witnessed Rachel arguing with Mark, and that he was last seen running from her. Rachel denied this, and Ms. Fern thinks Rachel deliberately lied. Ms. Fern says the penmanship medal was missing. Rachel insists she didn't take the medal, but admits she lied to Ms. Fern because she didn't want to be blamed. When they get home, there is a couple, Rita and Fred Daigler, that have come to talk with them. Rita knows Rachel was the last person to see Mark alive and she is looking for the medal. Rachel goes out to play and Christine invites The Daiglers to come inside for coffee. Rita is desperate to find the medal, because of the significance to Mark that winning it was. Christine apologizes, but is adamant that she and Rachel do not know where it is. As the Daiglers leave, Rita mentions the bruises on Mark's body. Monica comes by to get the locket she'd given Rachel as a gift so that she can take it to the jeweller to have the gemstone changed for her. Christine is horrified to find the penmanship medal while looking for the locket. She confronts Rachel about it, and she admits that she lied. She says she asked Mark if she could see the medal, and he said no. She offered him money to let her carry it around, and he agreed. She says she lied because she thought people would think she stole it. Rachel is outside playing when Leroy brings up his theory about her killing Mark. She counters his attack by bringing up things she knows about him and they threaten each other with info that could be used as blackmail. Christine considers whether a lack of morality can be hereditary. Later, Christine has a nightmare that she is a little girl who is being chased through a cornfield by a woman, Bessie Danker, with a knife. She awakens and realizes she is related to Bessie Danker because she is called by \\"Christine Danker\\". The next day, Richard confirms that the details of Christine's recurring nightmare are actually a true memories, and they adopted her after Bessie was arrested. They didn't tell her about it because they thought she was too young to remember, and Christine worries that Rachel may have inherited psychopathy from Bessie. Rachel is playing when Leroy provokes her into argument. He mentions that trace evidence can be found even if someone tries to wash it away and that there is an electric chair for children. She thinks he is lying until he calls Emory over to verify that some things Leroy mentioned are true. Christine catches Rachel trying to dispose of her shoes. She realizes they were used in Mark's killing because of the bruises he had. Leroy lies to Rachel by telling her he got her shoes out of the incinerator before they burned up. He becomes her next victim when she locks him into a shed and sets it on fire. Christine attempts a murder-suicide by giving Rachel an overdose of sleeping pills, and shooting herself with a revolver. Rachel survives and goes to live with Richard.

He is a graduate of the Savio Vega Wrestling Academy and began his career working for the International Wrestling Association, where he won the IWA World Tag Team Championship in his debut. Ayala later migrated to the World Wrestling Council, where he appeared as a part-time performer. Personal life Ayala became interested in professional wrestling at a very early age. His grandfather used to attend the cards held by the World Wrestling Council (WWC), where he became a follower of Ray Gonz√°lez. As a teenager, he was inspired by Germ√°n Figueroa, beginning weight training at the age of 15. Three years later he began training to become a wrestler, with the help of his compadre, performer Luis Maldonado who would hitchhike him to the classes when he still did not own a car. Afterwards, Ayala joined the newly opened Savio Vega Wrestling Academy in Trujillo Alto, training there for almost a year. He would train two days per week, Mondays and Wednesdays. Despite suffering an ankle fracture that suspended his training for a period of three months, he continued forward and graduated. As part of his training, Ayala would visit the IWA cards in a non-active role. Ayala married his fianc√©e in 2016. After training at the Juncos amateur wrestling gym, Ayala made his debut on October 15, 2016, finishing second in the Puerto Rico Beach Wrestling Tournament. In 2019, he joined Jos√© Estrada Sr. to inaugurate the Humacao Professional Wrestling Academy, the first of its kind in that region of Puerto Rico. Besides support from a number of veterans, the institution was also supported by Hugo Savinovich who had taken up an sponsor role in Ayala's career. Professional wrestling career Early career, IWA and WWC (2011-2014) On August 6, 2011, Ayala participated in a tryout for the International Wrestling Association. Later on the same night he made his official debut, winning the IWA World Tag Team Championship along F√©liz \\"Zaion\\" Torres Vega by replacing an injured Carlos Cotto. The following week, the titles were stripped and returned to the former champions, Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodr√≠guez. After being called \\"Big Jonathan\\" in an edition of Impacto Total, he was rebranded as \\"Diego de Jes√∫s\\", a name proposed by Savio Vega. Ayala and his partner won a match to recover the first contenders' spot, but failed to win the titles. They continued to pursue the titles, being uninvolved in the conclusion of a four way match at Halloween Mayhem and losing a first contenders' eliminatory in the following card. Despite competing in several tag team contests, Ayala remained unpinned and an angle against Chris Angel, the only wrestler to win the IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship undefeated, was teased in a faceoff. In his individual debut, he won a handicap match against El Generico and a third wrestler. Ayala closed the year by being voted \\"Rookie of the Year\\" in Puerto Rico Wrestling's Best of the Year public vote. Like his predecessor, Chris Angel, he won the award after only one singles match, but with participation in more than one official contest. On January 28, 2012, Ayala won his first one-on-one contest, as part of the undercard of Histeria Boricua. Despite being featured in promotional material for Kaos and Odyssey, an annual event, he was not included in the official card. Ayala left the IWA shortly afterwards, still unpinned in singles competition. Now known as \\"Sebasti√°n Guerra\\", he reappeared on April 9, 2012, following months of inactivity and was announced as the new member of The Academy, a stable previously formed by Angel and Phillip Cardona. The decision to join WWC was coordinated between the three wrestlers. However, the following month the group splintered when Ayala announced his return to the IWA's Juicio Final show and the original members debuted in WWC. This was based on a desire to remain active. After Juicio Final was postponed for specified reasons and the IWA entered a hiatus, Ayala visited a WWC card as a fan. After appearing in the crowd, he was invited to join WWC by Carlos Col√≥n, Sr. and later attended an official interview. No longer a member of The Academy, he was reintroduced as a planted fan, having weekly verbal confrontations with Andy Levine. At Noche del Fan√°tico, Ayala interfered in a match between Levine and Germ√°n Figueroa. On September 28, 2012, Ayala made his in-ring debut by defeating a jobber. At Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza he won a three-way match, leaving both of his opponents unconscious in the ring. Later in the card, Ayala aided Angel by distracting his opponent. He lost his first singles match to Samson Walker, who was able to pin him down while manager Orlando Toledo held his leg from outside the ring. On November 17, 2012, Ayala was included in a tournament for the vacant WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated. In the final event of the year, he defeated \\"El S√∫per Gladiador\\" Ricky Font√°n by submission. At Euphoria 2013. Ayala defeated \\"El Diabolico\\" Rolando Hern√°ndez. This was followed by a single-elimination four way match, where the other participants were Figueroa, Levine and The Sandman, but he was not one of the finalists. Both former members of The Academy reunited in an unsuccessful challenge against Thunder and Lightning. Afterwards, Ayala returned to singles competition, performing in a match to determine the first contender for the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. His following appearances were losses against Savio Vega and Andy Levine. Ayala was then placed over a series of jobbers, including Julio \\"Barrabas, Jr.\\" L√≥pez. At La Hora de La Verdad, he teamed with Enrique Elier Sinagaglia in a losing effort. The former members of The Academy met again afterwards, this time as opponents, with Angel defeating Ayala. Now serving as a part-time performer, he lost to Gilbert Cruz on October 19, 2013. His next appearance was a win over AJ Castillo. At Crossfire 2013, Ayala lost to Pedro \\"Ash\\" Arbelo due to illegal tactics. International exposition and tryouts (2013‚Äì2014) A World Wrestling Entertainment scout was present at WWC's Euphoria 2013 event. This was his very first major event in the promotion and Ayala was only made aware of the scout's presence moments before his match. This individual issued a favorable review of Ayala, based on his youth, physique and stature, offering him a tryout for the multinational company. The tryout took place on August 30, 2013, at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. Among the WWE personnel present was Triple H, William Regal, Jesse James, Dusty Rhodes, Steve Taylor, Joe Mercury, Norman Smiley, Jim Ross and some active roster wrestlers. Ayala was the youngest among 30 participants, as well as the only Latino in attendance as part of the Performance Center's inaugural recruitment class. He was paired with Davey Richards in the tryout match. This was the very first time that he had traveled outside of Puerto Rico and he was accompanied by fellow wrestler Samson Walker. Based on the recommendations offered at this event, Ayala devised an action plan, where he would join the now-independent Ohio Valley Wrestling to work on his English promos and adapt to the WWE's style. Once this stage is completed, he expects to join NXT. Shortly afterwards, WWE's main rival Total Nonstop Action Wrestling also showed interest in him following a scouting report of its own. The promotion personally extended a tryout invitation and its co-founder, Jeff Jarrett, was involved in the recruitment. However, due to the possibility of losing the chance to join NXT, Ayala decided to continue his original plan. Jarrett himself left TNA shortly afterwards. On May 31, 2014, Ayala joined the World Wrestling League, where he would wrestle in a tag team with Figueroa under a new character, ATLAS. However, this arrangement was temporary, until he permanently moved to Orlando in order to join NXT.

It was one of many historical fiction works she wrote in her life. Plot summary The book follows the life of Richard III, the last Plantagenet king of England. Born in 1452 to Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville, Richard was the eighth and youngest of the couple's children. The story begins in 1460, just after Richard's father, elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland and uncle Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury are killed at the Battle of Wakefield. Richard and his brother George, Duke of Clarence are hurried away to the Duchy of Burgundy. At this point a recurring character named Jon Fogge is introduced, who acts as a bogeyman and looming threat throughout the book. A character by the same name and who must be assumed to be the same, is Richard's last attendant after his defeat and death at the Battle of Bosworth. As a historical character, Sir John Fogge was an early supporter of Edward IV, who later switched his allegiance to Henry VII and apparently did fight against Richard at Bosworth.Sir John Fogge Fogge later married into the family of Katherine Haute, who was possibly the mother of Richard's illegitimate daughter Katherine. The book is divided into three sections, covering the years of Richard's youth (1460‚Äì1466), his young adulthood serving his brother Edward IV (1470‚Äì1472) when the Warwick-Clarence rebellion occurred and the period encompassing Edward's death and Richard's own brief reign from 1482 to his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Although much is omitted from Richard's life, such as his life in exile as a child when he and his brother lodged with the printer William Caxton, the details of his wardship under his cousin Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Richard's military and administrative exploits on the Scottish border, the author includes what she sees as the major events of his life - the violent death of his father, the conquering kingship of his brother Edward, the secret marriage to Elizabeth Woodville that nearly costs Edward his throne, the final triumph of Edward, the King's sudden death and Richard's own shock to discover that his brother's marriage was not legal, his own elevation to the throne of England, the tragic deaths of his wife and son and finally his betrayal and death at Bosworth. It seems that Bowen believes that Richard was completely unconnected with the mysterious disappearances of The Princes in the Tower for unlike some other fictional treatments, such as Michael Tyler-Whittle's Richard III, The Last Plantagenet, the episode is never even referred to in the book. In fact, the two princes are still presumably alive when Richard meets his own death. Richard himself is the major character and the book's events are viewed through his eyes. There is little examination of other characters other than through Richard's own analysis, but that analysis is surprisingly sympathetic - although completely loyal to Edward, Richard is clearly able to see others' points of view as well. Throughout he is depicted as a sensitive, loyal and honorable man, a fierce and skilled - albeit sometimes reluctant - warrior and a loving family man, though constantly haunted by the violent events in his past. He is convinced throughout the book that he is followed by the Devil - a belief that appears to be justified at the very end by the Fogge character, while watching the defeated King's corpse being brought to the abbey. 'Sir, one of Sir William Stanley's men,' replied the knight, still smiling, but with a look which made the Tudor followers draw away from him, 'and many deeds have I done against Richard Plantagenet, and now I have my reward.'http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks09/0900531.txt Literary significance and criticism Dickon is one of several fictional treatments of the last Plantagenet king wherein the author argued for his innocence in the murder of his nephews and presented him as a good man and potentially a very good king. Other authors and historians who wrote defenses - both fictional and historical - of Richard included Horace Walpole, Josephine Tey, Tyler-Whittle and Thomas Costain. The book received good reviews at its time of publication, but is not as well known as some of Bowen's other works. Works with similar themes *Valerie Anand, another popular writer, wrote a novel, Crown of Roses (1989), in which Richard III is presented as innocent of the murder of the Princes. *Michael Tyler-Whittle wrote Richard III, The Last Plantagenet (1970),https://www.amazon.com/Richard-III-Michael-Sidney-Tyler- Whittle/dp/0801955467 which also presents Richard as innocent of the Princes' murder, although Tyler-Whittle makes one of his attendants guilty. *Mystery author Elizabeth George revisits this theme in I, Richard and The Murders of Richard III. *Sharon Kay Penman, her award winning novel \\"The Sunne in Splendour\\".,http://www.sharonkaypenman.com/index.htm in which one of Richard's stooges, the Duke of Buckingham, is presented as the murderer of the princes rather than Richard. *Thomas Costain wrote a narrative historical series in the 1950s and 1960s about the Plantagenets.

Location ‚ÄùTombs of the Martyrs‚Äù (top left) shown at the site of the Nebi Akasha Mosque in the 1841 Aldrich and Symonds map of Jerusalem The Nebi Akasha Mosque is located on Straus Street in western Jerusalem, north of the Old City. History Tomb of Nebi Akasha (Turbat Qameria) Park between the mosque and tomb The tomb of Ukasha ibn al- Mihsan, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad who settled in Jerusalem following the siege of Jerusalem in 637/38, was built in the 12th century CE. According to Islamic tradition, Saladin's soldiers were buried at the site; it became known as the ‚ÄúTomb of the Martyrs‚Äù. Additions were made to the tomb by the Mamluks in the 13th-century. There is also a tradition that Moses, Jesus and Muhammad were buried here, leading the British High Commissioner John Chancellor to name the nearby street Street of the Prophets. Over a 70-year period in the 1800s, the hill on which the tomb stands was used as a meeting place by students of the Vilna Gaon. These Jews rented the hill from its Arab owners and gathered for study and Friday-night prayers in a tent, joined by local Ashkenazi and Sephardi kabbalists. In the late 19th century, an almost entirely Jewish neighborhood called Ukasha in the Ottoman census lists developed around the tomb with the Jewish housing estates of Sha'arey Moshe or the Wittenberg Houses (called the Waytenberk neighborhood in the Ottoman census) founded in 1885, Even Yehoshua founded in 1891, and Kolel Varsha (called the Rabi Daud neighborhood in the Ottoman census) founded in 1897. A mosque was built beside the tomb in the 19th century. 20th century Desecrated graves in the Nebi Akasha Mosque during the 1929 Palestine riots. Destroyed by Jewish rioters, August 23 to 31, 1929 On 26 August 1929, during the 1929 Palestine riots, the mosque was attacked by a group of Jews. The mosque was badly damaged and the tombs were desecrated.Shaw report, p. 65. As a result of the Palestinian Arab exodus from western Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the mosque was abandoned. Today it is located in the middle of a park in a Haredi Jewish neighborhood. It is situated near the junction of Straus Street and the Street of the Prophets. In December 2011 the mosque was defaced with graffiti by right-wing extremists who tried to set fire to it in a price tag attack. The mosque is inactive and the Jerusalem Municipality uses it as a storage room. Inscription The tomb includes the following inscription: (translation: There is no God but Allah Ÿêand Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, this is the shrine of our master Akasha, the companion of the Messenger of Allah). The tomb includes a date: (1280 AH, or 1863 CE), which was the date of the reconstruction of the tomb.

The first six books were written by Julie Campbell Tatham. The following titles were written by various in-house writers of Western Publishing under the pseudonym \\"Kathryn Kenny.\\" In 2003, Random House re- issued the first four books of the series. Original six written by Julie Campbell Tatham 1.The Secret of the Mansion (1948) The book opens with thirteen-year-old Trixie begging her mother for a horse. Her two older brothers are away at camp for the summer, and Trixie is afraid she will be bored at their house, Crabapple Farm. The family cannot afford a horse, so Trixie is told she will have to save her money to buy one. She then sees a horse trailer outside a neighboring mansion. The Wheelers, a rich family from New York City, have just bought the mansion and are moving in with their teenaged daughter, Honey. Although tough Trixie thinks Honey is a sissy at first, they soon become fast friends. Trixie realizes that Honey really is a \\"poor little rich girl\\", her parents are never home, she has been very sickly, and she grew up at boarding schools, at camps, and with governesses. Trixie helps her new friend overcome these problems, while Honey balances Trixie's rash and impatient personality with her tactfulness and gentleness. Recently, Trixie's neighbor on the other side was taken to the hospital with pneumonia. Trixie uses this chance to explore around the miser's rundown old mansion. Under the pretense of locking a window, Trixie and Honey climb inside to look around. They are shocked to find a tall, redheaded boy asleep on a mattress. The boy is Jim Frayne, the miser's 15-year-old great-nephew, who is running away from his abusive stepfather. The three become close friends, with the girls smuggling food to the mansion for Jim. Local legend says the old man hid his fortune in the house, electing to live in poverty after his beloved wife‚Äôs death. Honey and Jim are doubtful, but Trixie is sure the money is there somewhere if only they can find it before Jim's evil stepfather comes looking for him. Eventually, Jonesy, the stepfather, does come after a newspaper article about an airplane crashing near the miser's mansion also features the news of the miser's death, the legend of the fortune, and a photo of a fireplace with Jim's silver christening mug on the mantle. Trixie finds the engagement ring that Jim's great-uncle gave his wife in a safe. After Jonesy shows up, Trixie wakes up in the middle of the night and sees smoke from her window. The girls call the fire department and go to warn Jim. The mansion is burned almost to the ground, and Jim sleeps in the hidden summerhouse. When Trixie and Honey go there to the next morning to visit him, they find him gone and a note with the engagement ring in the summerhouse saying goodbye. He has run away again, this time in possession of some money he found hidden in the mattress he had been sleeping on. The girls meet the great-uncle's lawyer, Mr. Rainsford, who tells them Jim's uncle set up a half-million dollar trust for him and that Jonesy will be replaced as the boy's guardian. He asks them to track Jim down. 2\\\\.

They decide to check the boys' camps upstate since Jim mentioned getting a job there, but he always seems to be one step ahead of them. On the trip, Trixie and Honey are faced with: a strange and poor family in a luxurious trailer; that family's missing daughter; Mrs. Smith, a fat and motherly woman who's missing her locket; a trailer-robbing ring; and two suspicious workers at their trailer camp who may be involved. Trixie knows that the mysteries are tied together and the answer lies in the nearby forest. At the end of the book, Honey's parents return. Honey runs to her mother and gives her a hug, something she has never done before. Her mother forgets her own shyness and hugs her daughter back.

Chloe supposedly baked a cake containing extract of boiled and reduced oleander leaves, which are extremely poisonous. The various legends diverge as to why she did this, a house maid who was getting the favor of the mistress was a suspect with some saying she was getting revenge on the Woodruffs and some saying she was attempting to redeem her position by curing the family of the poisoning. According to the legends, her plan backfired. Only Sara and her two daughters ate the cake, and all died from the poison. Chloe was then supposedly hanged by the other slaves, and thrown into the Mississippi River, either as punishment or to escape punishment by Clark Woodruff for harboring her. The historical record does not support this legend. There is no record of the Woodruffs owning a slave named Chloe or Cloe, or any slaves. The legends usually claim that Sara and her two daughters were poisoned, but Mary Octavia survived well into adulthood. Finally, Sara, James, and Cornelia Woodruff were not killed by poisoning, but instead succumbed to yellow fever. Regardless of the factual accuracy of the Chloe story, some believe a woman wearing a green turban haunts the plantation. Other legends There are a variety of other legends surrounding the Myrtles. The house is reputedly built over an Indian burial ground, and the ghost of a young Native American woman has been reported. During the Civil War, the house was ransacked by Union soldiers, and legend claims that three were killed in the house. Supposedly, there is a blood stain in a doorway, roughly the size of a human body, that will not (or would not) come clean. Other legends say that cleaners have been unable to push their mop or broom into that space. A mirror located in the house supposedly holds the spirits of Sara Woodruff and two of her children. According to custom, mirrors are covered after a death, but legend says that after the poisoning of the Woodruffs, this particular mirror was overlooked. The uncovered mirror reportedly trapped the spirits of Sara and her children, who are occasionally seen or leave handprints in the mirror.  \\"Haunted Plantation - Myrtles Plantation Bed and Breakfast, St. Francisville, Louisiana\\" by Joe Nickell, Skeptical Inquirer, September‚ÄìOctober 2003, retrieved July 18, 2006 The plantation is also reportedly haunted by a young girl who died in 1868, despite being treated by a local voodoo practitioner.

Some have said that this is William Drew Winter, the victim of the only verified murder in the house. He was shot on his front porch and, according to legend, staggered or crawled up the stairs, but collapsed, dead, on the 17th step. Alternate versions of his murder claim he managed to crawl up the stairs, and collapsed in his wife's arms on the 17th step.Hawes, Wilson and Friedman, p. 140.

His points of focus were: * Open government, specifically requiring legislative caucuses to be open. * Changes in Judicial Code, this included a bill which provided for expungement of juvenile records. * Providing funding for children's justice centers in Wasatch and Emery Counties.  Judicial career  Daniels served as Judge of the Third Judicial District for ten years, from 1982 until 1992. He was appointed by Governor Scott Matheson and served as presiding judge from 1986 to 1990  Interest in the plight of victims of crime  Governor Matheson called for a task force on collection of restitution for crime victims which was co-chaired by Daniels (while on the bench), and Le Roy McAlister. The task force was successful in drafting legislation establishing the Utah Office for Victims of Crime and setting a surcharge on fines which would provide funding to help compensate victims of crime for injuries which were not covered by insurance. Daniels was then the first chair of \\"The Utah Council on Crime Victims,\\" which was established by governor Matheson, and ultimately went on to pass an amendment to the Utah Constitution to give victims of crime Constitutional rights on equal status with those enjoyed by persons accused of committing crimes.  Decision regarding child sex offender  In 1991, the Utah Supreme Court upheld Daniels' prison sentences against three child sexual abusers. Craig B. Herman, Thomas J. Oopfar and Bobby Lee Boog Jr, claimed that their rights to equal protection under the law were violated because other child sex offenders convicted of similar crimes have been given more lenient sentences. This lawsuit was filed in the 3rd District Court and was rejected by Daniels. The decision was then appealed to the Utah Supreme Court where the decision was upheld.  Stance on marital rape  In February 1991, Daniels voiced his opinion in support of legislation that makes marital rape illegal, saying \\"this will make a strong statement to the people of Utah that women are not property of their husbands.\\"  Sandy \\"ski connect\\" road construction  In August 1988, Daniels issued an injunction to halt construction of the \\"ski connect\\" road which would later be built to connect 90th south and 7th East with 94th South and 1150 East. the injunction required the Utah Department of Transportation to hold a public hearing before the construction halt could be re-evaluated References 1948 births Living people Utah lawyers Members of the Utah House of Representatives Utah state senators Utah state court judges People from Payson, Utah Military personnel from Utah Brigham Young University alumni S.J.

The series follows Maho Shirafune as he tries to become an astronaut. St&rs; was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from June 2011 to April 2012, with its chapters compiled into five tank≈çbon volumes. Plot On August 10, 2019, Earth received a signal, which was confirmed by hundreds of different scientists to be from an alien life form. The message: \\"Let us meet on Mars on July 7, 2035\\". With this, a space agency representing all of Earth was formed, named ST&RS.; From there on, many different events occurred quite quickly, such as the re-landing of people on the moon in 2022 and the construction of many new space stations. Later on, the Space Academy was founded as a way to train upcoming generations of ST&RS.; Also on August 10 of 2019, the same day that Earth received the message from the alien life form, a young boy named Shirafune Maho uttered his first word, and the word was \\"Mars\\". Ever since that moment, Maho has been obsessed with astronomy, and the only thing that he has on his mind is the universe. He decides at an early age that he will apply to the Space Academy to train to become an astronaut, along with his childhood friend, Hishihara Meguru, and a transfer student and genius classmate, Amachi Wataru. The newfound trio begins a seemingly impossible journey to get accepted into an academy where all applicants only have a 1% chance of being accepted into the Space Academy.  Characters  ; :The main protagonist of the series. He is a 15-year-old boy who aims to be in the Space Academy so that he can get to Mars in 2035. Although he can be quite stubborn, he is also quick witted and smart. He is also known for knowing everything there is to know about space. He can approximate the proper location of the planets along with their respectful distances to the sun and each other, and can almost instinctively know if something is off or inaccurate. He is kind-hearted, and will always reach out to somebody in need. Maho also works very well with his friends, making him a very good partner. His first word was Mars. He is good friends with Meguru Hishihara and Wataru Amachi. :One of his particular traits is his remarkable sense of distance perception and three-dimensional processing abilities, dubbed \\"Dimensional Ability\\". He can accurately shoot a bottle into a recycling bin's narrow opening from a fair distance and recreate a model of the Apollo spaceship while blindfolded after following a few instructions/analogies read to him by his friends. ; :One of the main characters in the story. She is Maho's childhood friend, both having been born in the same hospital, albeit a day apart. Although she tends to act more like his \\"guardian\\" from time to time, she harbors a secret affection for Maho, becoming embarrassed or flustered whenever the subject or anything related to it is brought up. Originally, Meguru did not want to become an astronaut. Her original dream was to obtain a gold medal for volleyball in the Olympics. She was also somewhat responsible for Maho's drive to reach his goal. :Out of the three of them (Maho, Meguru, and Wataru), Meguru seems to be the most physically fit, having gone through \\"volleyball death camp\\". Quite a few characters are curious as to what exactly went on during that camp. However of the three of them, she knows the least about space. ; :One of the main characters. He transfers from Tokyo to Maho and Meguru's school a week before the briefing session for the space academy. Maho could feel a kindred spirit in Wataru; with both being interested in space. When he was younger, he wanted to become a doctor, like his father, until he met one of his father's colleagues‚Äîwho was an astronaut doctor. That began his dreams of becoming an astronaut himself, while also becoming a doctor. He also seems to be quite popular with females. :Wataru, as a foil to his friends, is the calm, level-headed one of the group; only being provoked after someone jokes about another person's welfare. In addition, Wataru is their resident genius, often providing helpful facts and other tidbits of information.  Publication  St&rs; is written by Takeuchi Ryosuke and illustrated by Miyokawa Masaru.

Overview The record features only eight songs, an unusually short album for the period when most long-playing records had eleven or twelve songs on them. Among the tracks are Christmas songs made famous by Elvis Presley (\\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", \\"Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)\\"), \\"Santa Baby\\", popularised by Eartha Kitt as well as a not specifically Christmas tune \\"From Me to You\\" by The Beatles. West inserted her own catchphrases into the songs' lyrics for parody effect, for example: \\"If I have to choose between two evils, I'm gonna pick the one I never tried before\\" or \\"A man under the mistletoe is worth two under the tree\\". The record was produced by David Mallet who also created her quintessential rock album WAY OUT WEST in the same year. The LP was recorded and released not long after West's surprisingly successful rock and roll debut Way Out West for Tower Records. This album, however, was released by the small label Dagonet Records and did not enter the charts. It was re-released as Mae in December in 1980 with a re-arranged track listing and different artwork. In 2009, it re- appeared as Christmas Classics in digital format, retaining the 1980 track listing but again sporting a different cover image.

It represented workers employed in warehousing, transport logistics, and a limited range of manufacturing industries in Australia.  History  The Storemen and Packers Union was formed in 1912. The union expanded rapidly after its creation, and became a prominent and influential member of the right wing faction of the Australian labour movement. During the 1970s and 80s the Storemen and Packers was heavily involved in the establishment of the superannuation system through a direct action campaign. In 1988 the union amalgamated with the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia to form the National Union of Storeworkers, Packers, Rubber and Allied Workers. Several other small manufacturing and distribution unions soon joined the new body, and in 1991 it was renamed the National Union of Workers.

Biography Traxler was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on 25 July 1928 to Ralph N. and Mabel (Barnett) Traxler. He received his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Texas at Austin. He served in the US Army during the Korean War and retired as a major after twenty-three years of reserve service in the military. He married Carolyn Cain in 1952, and they had three daughters, Marla, Suzanne, and Carol. Beginning in 1958, Traxler taught at the University of Southwest Louisiana at Lafayette, Louisiana for thirteen years, earning a distinguished faculty award from the university in 1965 for his research on petroleum degradation. He joined the faculty of the University of Rhode Island in 1971 as a professor of microbiology, founding the biotechnology program at the university in 1986. Traxler had been chairman of two different departments at the University of Rhode Island: Plant Pathology and Entomology, and Food Science and Nutrition, and he was a member of American Society for Microbiology and the Society for Industrial Microbiology.

Life He was born in the parish of Stamford, Lincolnshire on 19 November 1740, the only child of Michael Tyson (d. 22 February 1794, aged 83), dean of Stamford and archdeacon of Huntingdon, by his first wife, Elizabeth Curtis of Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire. He entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1759, became a scholar, and studied Greek under the Rev. John Cowper, brother of William Cowper, the poet. He graduated B.A. (11th Wrangler) in 1764, M.A. in 1767, and B.D. in 1775, and in 1767 was elected to a fellowship at his college. In the autumn of 1766 Tyson accompanied Richard Gough in a tour, of which he kept a journal, through the north of England and Scotland; during the journey he was made a burgess of Glasgow (12 September 1766) and of Inverary (17 September) He returned to residence at college, and devoted himself to etching and botany. With Israel Lyons the younger he made trips in search of rare plants around Cambridge. Tyson was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 2 June 1768, and Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 February 1779. On 17 March 1769 he made himself conspicuous at Cambridge by voting with John Jebb in a minority of two against the Tory address to George III. Tyson was ordained deacon by John Green at Whitehall chapel on 11 March 1770, and until 1772 was minister of Sawston, Cambridgeshire. For a time he was dean of his college, and he was bursar about 1774 when he succeeded to the cure of St Bene't's Church in Cambridge. In 1776 Tyson became Whitehall preacher. In the same year he and the Rev. Thomas Kerrich made a catalogue of the prints in the university library at Cambridge. In March 1778 Tyson was inducted, after a long legal dispute, to the rectory of Lambourne near Ongar in Essex. He died at Lambourne on 4 May 1780 from a fever, which carried him off within a week, and was buried on 10 May outside the communion rails. Tyson's library was sold by Leigh & Sotheby in 1781. Works Etching of Browne Willis (1771) after a portrait by Michael Dahl Tyson executed engravings, etchings, and miniatures for private circulation; some of them were put on public sale. He made etchings of Cambridgeshire churches and tombs, and of the portraits of the masters of his college. One of Jacob Butler, proprietor of the Barnwell estate, is in the Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica, vol. v., and his drawing of Browne Willis is in John Nichols's Literary Anecdotes (viii. 219). He etched and dedicated to William Cole a portrait of Michael Dalton. Several of his drawings are in the Antiquarian Repertory. Engraving of Richard Love An account by Tyson of a fish brought by Commodore John Byron from the Pacific appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of 1771; and he wrote English verses in the university collections on the accession of George III (1760), his marriage (1761), the birth of the Prince of Wales (1762), and on the peace (1763). He contemplated a work on Queen Elizabeth's progresses, but it was carried out by John Nichols, who received information from Tyson. A description of an illuminated manuscript at Corpus Christi College, with plates by him, was printed as his paper in Arch√¶ologia (ii. 194‚Äì7), and reprinted at Cambridge in 1770 as his work; but the authorship was also claimed by Cole. Tyson was one of a group at Corpus Christi called the \\"Benedictines\\" (Corpus had been known as Benet College), that included Robert Masters and James Nasmith as well as Cole (not at Corpus) and Gough. He was also friendly with James Essex, Horace Walpole, Sir John Cullum, 6th Baronet, and Samuel Henley. Letters to and from him are in Nichols's Illustrations of Literature. Gough paid tributes to his memory in Sepulchral Monuments (which has some of Tyson's drawings), and in his edition of William Camden's Britannia. Gough, however, in some verses on his friend, calls him 'idlest of men on old Camus banks.' Tyson was acquainted with the circle around Thomas Gray; he account of Gray's knowledge of natural history in William Mason's life of the poet was by Tyson, who met Charles Victor de Bonstetten also. He made the etching of the caricature by Mason of Rev. Henry Etough under which Gray wrote a derogatory epigram.Robert L. Mack, Thomas Gray: A Life (2000), p. 364 and p. 639. Family On 4 July 1778 he was married at St Bene't's Church, Cambridge, to Margaret, daughter of Hitch Wale of Shelford in Cambridgeshire. He left one son, Michael Curtis Tyson (1779‚Äì1794), who inherited Elizabeth Curtis' manors of Barholm and Stow-cum- Deeping in Lincolnshire. His widow married, as her second husband, in the autumn of 1784, Isaac Crouch, assistant clerk of the minutes of the custom- house.

The product series features desktops in both tower and All-in-One form factors, designed to save up to 70% desk space as compared to traditional tower desktop PCs. The ThinkCentre Edge desktop series represents the first time the 'Edge' brand has been used for any Lenovo product outside of the ThinkPad product line. The first desktop in the series was the Edge 91z AIO, announced on May 16, 2011. Design According to Paul Scaini, the Segment Manager for the ThinkCentre product line, the ThinkCentre Edge desktops were the result of a large amount of time spent on refining the overall product appearance. The Edge 91z was described in the article as being the epitome of that effort, with its Infinity Glass design. In the article, Paul Scaini also indicated that while appearance was a focus of the ThinkCentre Edge series, it retained the core values of the ThinkCentre desktop product line. Comparing it to the ThinkCentre M Series AIOs, Paul indicated that the Edge AIO desktops had the same serviceability and mounting features. Additionally, the ThinkCentre Edge desktops included second generation Intel Core i desktop CPUs and Lenovo Enhanced Experience 2.0. 2014 ThinkCentre Edge 73 *Up to 4th generation Intel Core i7 processor *Up to Windows 8 64-bit *Up to 2TB HDD / Up to 128GB SSD *Up to 16GB memory 2013 ThinkCentre Edge 72 2011 Four desktops in the ThinkCentre Edge series were launched in 2011. These were: *ThinkCentre Edge 91z (AIO) *ThinkCentre Edge 91 (tower) *ThinkCentre Edge 71z (AIO) *ThinkCentre Edge 71 (tower) ThinkCentre Edge 91z The ThinkCentre Edge 91z AIO was summarized by PCMag as being a reasonably priced, powerful desktop with the capacity to \\"give the iMac a run for its place in a design studio.\\" In terms of design, the Edge 91z was 2.5 inches thin. The Edge 91z was described as being \\"less flashy\\" than the IdeaCentre desktops and AIOs. However, the reviewer continued to say that the minimalist design would appeal to business users and owners. The Edge 91z was described as being simple with a seamless front and two removable feet that could be detached from the AIO. The space between the two feet was open and meant to store a keyboard. This was described as being different from the IdeaCentre B520 desktop, in which the keyboard storage was blocked by the speaker bar. The display on offer with the Edge 91z AIO was a true 1080p HD and, when mounted on a wall, was reported to resemble a HDTV or a large screen monitor. A drawback of the screen was indicated to be the glass front panel, which reflected ambient light as well as objects within a room. An optional DVD writer was available on the Edge 91z AIO. The AIO was reported by PCMag to be lacking in \\"would be nice features\\". Among these features were eSATA ports, USB 3.0 ports, and HDMI-in. The software on the Edge 91z AIO was reported to be a useful set, with the system free of unnecessary software. The 30-day trial of Norton Internet Security was criticized since it was available as a free download on the Internet. Other software preinstalled on the AIO included Lenovo Rescue and Recovery and utilities for the DVD burner and the web camera. In comparison with the Apple iMac 21.5 inch (Thunderbolt) the ThinkCentre Edge 91z was reported to be similar in terms of performance and specifications. The iMac was described as being slightly faster on 3D-related and everyday tasks, while the ThinkCentre Edge 91z was slightly faster on multimedia benchmarks. Both desktops contained similarly sized widescreens, AMD graphics, Intel Core processors, 1TB storage space, and could be used as external monitors for laptops.

He was educated at Clarke's College in The Avenue, Southampton. He joined the ground staff at Southampton Football Club as an amateur in August 1933. He soon \\"showed an eye for goal\\" and was given a professional contract in October 1934, becoming an established member of the reserves, playing in the Football Combination. He made his first-team debut when he took the place of the injured Dick Neal for the Second Division match at Swansea Town on 19 September 1936. Withers played at outside-right in this match, which ended in a 5‚Äì1 defeat. Withers made five more appearances that season as cover for injured players in various positions across the forward line, without scoring. In December 1937, he moved to Bristol Rovers of the Third Division South, where he became a more settled member of the first team, making 17 league appearances, generally at inside-right, scoring four goals. In the summer of 1938, however, his professional career was over and he returned to Southampton, where he continued to play local non-league football with Bramtoco Sports. Later career Within a year, he left Southampton to move to London where he worked as a sports masseur. After the Second World War, he returned to Hampshire and became an accountant.

It specializes in underground and alternative comics, classic comic strip reprints, and foreign comics. It has built an international reputation for focusing on and promoting non-superhero comics in the superhero-dominated North American comic book market. The store has made effort to promote comics culture in Toronto by organizing the annual Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF) in co√∂peration with the Toronto Public Library, which also hosts Page & Panel, a nonprofit shop to support TCAF. The Beguiling also runs a sister store, Little Island Comics, the first North American comic shop aimed exclusively at children. History Joe Matt visits The Beguiling with Seth and Chester Brown (from Matt's Peepshow , Drawn and Quarterly, 1992). Founded in 1987 by Steve Solomos and Sean Scoffield on Harbord Street near the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, The Beguiling quickly built a reputation for the diversity of its stock, focused on art-oriented, avant-garde, underground and alternative comics‚Äî\\"anything that is even peripherally comic book-oriented\\", according to current owner Peter Birkemoe. In the earliest days, much of the store's income was made through mail order, as the material it dealt in was not mainstream. It also built a reputation for stocking the works of cartoonists such as Chester Brown and Julie Doucet, whose comics most stores would not handle due to the controversial nature of their contents. Well-known Toronto-based cartoonists such as the trio of Brown, Seth and Joe Matt became associated with the store, and sometimes depicted it in their comics. Others such as Jay Stephens made it their shop of choice. In 1998, Solomos and Scoffield decided to devote their time to creating art (and later film production), and ownership was passed to Peter Birkemoe and Shane Chung, who expanded operations. In 1992 it relocated to a two-floor Victorian building in Mirvish Village in Toronto, and has since branched out into selling to libraries, organizing the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, and running two more locations: Little Island Comics, which caters to children; and the nonprofit Page & Panel in the Toronto Public Library. By 2017, 50% of its sales were to libraries across Canada. Plans to redevelop Mirvish Village as condominiums pushed The Beguiling to find a new location. It moved 3 January 2017 to a location at 319 College Street, near the University of Toronto. The new location has since grown to about double the floor space of the previous one. Description and reputation The Beguiling is \\"a store with an agenda\\", according to Birkemoe, and has been derided for some for its perceived elitism, which stems in part from its sponsoring of Crash, a journal of comics criticism that mainly condemned bad comics. Others, such as comics historian Charles Hatfield, have praised the store for its sense of history, saying, \\"You always leave the shop with a larger sense of what comics are about.\\" The Beguiling is patronized by an international audience. The store has made the top five retailer list in The Comics Journal, and among the awards it has received, it shared the inaugural Eisner Spirit of Retailing Award in 1993, and it won the Joe Shuster Awards' Harry Kremer Retailer Award in 2010. Toronto Comic Arts Festival In 2003, Peter Birkemoe and Chris Butcher of The Beguiling first organized the Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF). Unusual in the world of comics conventions, TCAF is a free-admission event. It focuses on alternative and independent comics, but includes other creative arts besides comics. Rather than being like a traditional comics convention, it is patterned after European festivals such as Angoul√™me, and the American Small Press Expo. Little Island Comics Little Island Comics is a spin-off of the Beguiling aimed at children. As most North American comic shops focus on teenage and adult customers, and The Beguiling itself mainly on adults, the owners wanted to fill a void by opening the first children's comic shop in North America, and possibly the world. Little Island Comics opened 6 September 2011 at 742 Bathurst Street in the Annex, close to The Beguiling. The shop was designed with children in mind, with bright colours and shelves at child-height. When Mirvish Village closed in 2017, so did Little Island; several of the staff moved to Page & Panel. Little Island Comics re-opened at 323 College Street in February 2018, next to The Beguiling's new location there.

Hogan. The source material here was a book attributed to Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover entitled Persons in Hiding. The events are loosely based on the kidnapping of Edward Bremer by the Barker-Karpis gang, which Hoover believed to have been led by Ma Barker. The names of the persons involved and other details of events were changed at the request of the FBI.Hardy, Philip (ed), The BFI Companion to Crime, British Film Institute, 1997, p.42. Plot Infamous Ma Webster rules her clan of mobsters - mainly consisting of her three more or less criminally inclined sons - with an iron hand and without mercy. She is the terror of Centre City. She refuses to let anyone else handle the planning of all the clan's robberies, much to George Frost's dismay. George is the only clan member who isn't related to Ma Webster. George protests and makes a fuss about this, but to no avail. Ma and her sons Eddie, Charlie and Tom team up with George on Christmas Eve itself to rob the Centre City bank. They are warned, however, by Bert, Ma's more lawful son, who studies law and disdains the criminal behaviour of the rest of his family. Bert urges his mother and his brothers to get out of town to prevent them from being arrested for previous crimes the police and the FBI have found evidence of. Ma listens to Bert and takes the gang on a crime spree across several states. This tour gives the gang a heap of cash, including $300,000 in ransom for a kidnapping, as well as cash from various robberies. Since Ma and the gang are well aware that the cash they have received had been tagged by the FBI, and that the serial numbers of the bills are probably registered, they meet up with a shady character called Pan to make an exchange for unmarked ones. They get $100,000 in cash for the bounty, but the temptation of keeping their bounty is to strong, and they kill Pan and leave. What they don't know is that the FBI has a list of all the bills in Pan's possession, found in his coat pocket. Soon the Feds are in the gang's tracks again. Two federal agents are assigned to the case: Scott Langham and Ross Waring. These two agents track the gang down to a small town in the south of the United States, where they have taken refuge and Ma is posing as a socialite. When the agents come to town, Ma and the gang flee, and are forced to hide in cheap hotels around the country. The following Christmas holiday Ma returns to Centre City to visit her son Bert and his newborn baby. When she is away from the rest of the gang, they decide to do another robbery on their own. They hold up a store, but fail, with the result that Charlie is shot and killed and Tom is arrested. When Tom's trial comes up, Bert represents him, and convinces him to plead guilty and agree to return on his own free will to the city where they committed the kidnapping. The gang is split because of difference in opinion, and when George tries to leave to go his own way, Ma and Eddie kill him. They also contract another gang leader, Stitch Torey, and his men to help Tom escape from his incarceration. Stitch's gang fails in the attempt to free Tom, and most of the gang members are killed. Ma and Eddie are the only ones left of the original gang, and they have adopted a low profile. Eddie works in a cannery to support them both and Ma has become quite neighborly. But Eddie grows restless and careless. He sets up a hideout for some thugs he is hoping to join in a new robbery. He steals some cans from the workplace and gives them to the thugs. They in turn manage to crash their car on the way back with the cans, and the police get involved. When the police find Eddie's fingerprints on the cans they know he is nearby. On Christmas Eve Federal agents storm Ma and Eddie's home. A shoot-out ensues, in which Eddie is killed. Ma eventually surrenders herself to the police.

Hermens (20 December 1906 ‚Äì 2 February 1998) was a German- American political scientist and economist. He was born in Nieheim, Kreis H√∂xter (district) in Germany and he died in Rockville, MD (U.S.).K√ºrschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender 1976, 12th ed., Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1976, p. 1214. His major books \\"Democracy or Anarchy?\\" (1941) and \\"The Representative Republic\\" (1958) were translated into German, Italian and Hebrew. The most important contribution to the progress of political science has been his analysis of the impact that electoral systems have in structuring party competition. Hermens has advised U.S. Congressional committees on Presidential Election Procedure, the Judiciary and Divided Powers and Economic Policy, the U.S. government on re-organization of democracy in Germany and the government of Trinidad and Tobago on constitutional matters. Life and career Hermens studied at the Universities of M√ºnster, Freiburg, Berlin and Bonn, In 1928 he graduated from the University of Bonn with an M.A. in Economics (Diplom-Volkswirt). Here Joseph Schumpeter was the supervisor of his Ph.D. (Dr. rer. pol.) dissertation on \\"What is Capitalism?\\" ( published in 1931). After completing his Ph.D. in 1930 Hermens continued his studies of economic theory at the Universities of Paris and Kiel. In 1934 Hermens, an active member of a Catholic students' fraternity, left Nazi Germany to spend a year as a research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 1935 he emigrated to the U.S., where he served as an Assistant Professor of Economics with the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. In 1938 he moved to South Bend, IN where he became an Associate Professor of Economics with the University of Notre Dame. In 1945 he was made Professor of Political Science with the University of Notre Dame. Between 1959 and 1971 Hermens returned to post-war Germany to become Professor of Political Science at the University of Cologne. In this position he succeeded Heinrich Br√ºning, who had been Reichskanzler from 1930 to 1932. During his tenure at Cologne Hermens was supervisor for a couple of post-docs and Ph.D. candidates who later became professors of political science in German universities. Among them are: Rudolf Wildenmann (University of Mannheim), Gerda Zellentin (University of Wuppertal), Werner Kaltefleiter (University of Kiel), Hans Kammler (University of Hohenheim), Johannes Agnoli (Free University of Berlin), Paul Kevenh√∂rster (University of M√ºnster).Forschungsinstitut f√ºr Politische Wissenschaft und Europ√§ische Fragen, Jahresbericht 1989/90.

The film is inspired by the 1969 American film Mackenna's Gold. The plot involves an epigraphist and a geologist on a hunt for an ancient treasure in an island \\"Hasta Dweepa\\" (Palm Island), from the then 700-year-old Bherunda kingdom. The film is said to be ahead of its time of release and is considered \\"technically brilliant\\". However, it failed to perform commercially at the time. The 1987 Hindi movie Khazana was partially based on this movie. Plot The films opens to a visual narration with a series of ancient paintings, of a wealthy kingdom named Bherunda that existed around 700 years ago at the erstwhile Mysore State (present-day Karnataka), ruled by king Aditya Devanarayana. As a battle with the kingdom's enemies approached, he ordered that all the kingdom's wealth be transported and stored in a faraway island, in a cave. Having won the battle, the enemies returned empty-handed. But, the location of the wealth remained a mystery for centuries. Mark Abraham (Vajramuni), an epigraphist and linguistic expert, stumbles upon the writings of an explorer about the treasure of the Bherunda kingdom and determines to retrieve it, and is assisted by his student Myna (Jayamala). He is joined by Jai (Amrish Puri), a geologist, who breaks the news to Abraham of having the located the spot of the wrecks of the ship the carried the treasure to the island \\"Hasta Dweepa\\". They embark on a trip to retrieve the map of the cave, and Abraham is seen killing Jai assisted by Myna, after they retrieve a medal from the wreck. Raju (Srinath) and Bijju (Ambarish) are brothers working for Abraham, living with their little brother Chanda. Promising them of their share from the treasure, they embark to the island that holds the treasure. But, keen to not share the wealth with anybody, he kills Chanda and other crew on the boat and wounds the brothers, before leaving the island. Raju and Bijju are tended to by Nayar (Shankar Nag), an islander living with his dog, Manja. The trio return to the mainland and start living together leading a good life, but still holding a grudge toward Abraham. Two years later, on a day at work, they unearth a trunk containing an ancient vase, what proves to be treasure of Bherunda. Keenly following the developments is Jai, who had escaped death at the loss of his left arm. He insists that they join him in retrieving the treasure before Abraham does, to which they agree. Jai plants his sister Champa (Lakshmi) in Abraham's team to retrieve the map. Abraham's team embark to the island, tailed by Jai's team. Champa, in hurry to escape with the map, throws it into the sea and diving, and loses the map. She is helped to the Jai's boat by Raju and Bijju and decide to stay ashore the night, when their boat is destroyed by Abraham's men. Once on the island, Nayar breaks to the team that the island is the same to which the brothers had arrived with Abraham two years ago. Abraham arrives with his team, having killed his crew and assistants but Myna, who he stabs in the stomach on Jai's insistence, so that they share the wealth, prior to which latter ditched the brothers and his sister, and killing Nayar. Jai and Abraham reach the spot and enter the cave to find large quantity of wealth in the form of gold. The brothers enter the cave immediately afterwards with Champa, and a fight ensues between the brothers on one side and Jai and Abraham on the other. Bombed with explosives by Jai in the ensuing fight, all get killed but for Bijju and Champa, who leave the cave with the wealth untouched.

Life He was the son of Thomas Dalton of Hildersham, Cambridgeshire, and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1580. He was associated with Lincoln's Inn, moving there from Furnivall's Inn, being called to the bar and eventually becoming a bencher. He resided at West Wratting, Cambridgeshire, and was in the commission of the peace for the county. Works Dalton published: * The Countrey Justice, London, 1618, a treatise on the jurisdiction of justices of the peace out of session. Anthony Fitzherbert in L'Office et Auctoritee de Justices de Peace, 1514, English translation 1538) and William Lambarde (Eirenarcha, 1610) had already devoted substantive treatises to the duties of justices. Dalton's book differed from these in the limitation of its scope and the extent of its detail. It covered the types of case and offence where a magistrate (justice of the peace) could administer summary justice under statute law, there having been an extensive list of such situations (from poaching to poor church attendance) since the 16th century.Bradley Chapin, Criminal Justice in Colonial America, 1606-1660 (2010), p. 156; Google Books. A second edition appeared in 1619, prefaced by commendatory Latin verses by John Richardson, William Burton the Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow described as ‚Äòaffinis,‚Äô and William L'Isle. A third edition appeared in 1630, and a fourth in 1655. In 1666 the work was edited by a certain T. M. of Lincoln's Inn, who added a treatise on the jurisdiction in sessions, and new matter. Subsequent editions appeared in 1682, 1690, and 1742. * Officium Vicecomitum, or the Office and Authoritie of Sheriffs, London, 1623. An abridgment appeared in 1628 The last edition of this book was published in 1700. Dalton's works were sufficiently widely known for it to be suggested that his view of rules of evidence can account for conduct of the defendants in the trial of Thomas Cornell for murdering his mother, Rebecca Cornell, in Rhode Island in 1673.Elaine Forman Crane, Killed Strangely: the death of Rebecca Cornell (2002), p. 196; Google Books. Material on witchcraft passed into later editions of the Countrey Justice from earlier works (the Discoverie of Witches (1613) of Thomas Potts and the Guide to Grand-Jury Men (1627) of Richard Barnard), and was transmitted from there to the An Assistance to Justices of the Peace (1683) of Joseph Keble.George Lincoln Burr, Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases 1648 to 1706 (2003 reprint), p. 163 note 2; Google Books. Dalton also wrote an unpublished religious work in the tradition of Acts and Monuments, finished 1634 but left in manuscript. It was considered for publication by the Long Parliament in 1641, but the more extensive work of Thomas Harding was preferred by a committee under Edward Dering; in fact neither was printed.Anthony Milton, Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600-1640 (2002), pp. 320‚Äì1 and note 234; Google Books.

The plot follows a studio public relations man who attempts to trap a killer using television technology, allowing on-screen glimpses of technicians like Florey's cinematographer Karl Struss. Reginald Denny plays the suave head of PR for a movie studio, a role more often given to brassy actors such as Lionel Stander. He is a devoted fan of a mysterious actor who developed a cult following during the silent era. It is widely believed that it is a tragedy that he died before sound movies became the standard and there are people who see the idea of remaking his films as sound productions as bordering on sacrilege. From his description, this actor reflected elements of Rudolph Valentino and Lon Chaney, Sr.; he was an exotically handsome leading man and a master of disguise who appeared in many intense, weird roles. When an attempt is made to remake one of his starring vehicles as a musical, the effort seems cursed, with many accidents happening inexplicably. In time it becomes apparent that a murderer is lurking in the studio, possibly in the fashion of The Phantom of the Opera, and police quarantine the studio. Executives decide that work should continue on films as the night wears on. Denny and a technician hide in a sound editing room and eavesdrop on productions. There is an \\"iris out\\" effect whenever they tune in to a soundstage and the audience sees the films being shot. One is a horror film about a mysterious caped character called \\"The Batman\\". The film is noteworthy in that numerous suspects with credible motives are developed in the course of the story despite its short running time.

Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi is a flight training school established in 1986 and co-located with the airfield under the government of India.  Airlines and destinations  The airport/airstrip has only unscheduled chartered flights. Consideration of a new world class civil aviation university Rahul Gandhi rather than any other of the civil aviation officials announced the much-awaited venue of the civil aviation university, which till date was a mystery. Addressing a public function at Fursatganj in Raebareli district, Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi surprised everyone by his announcement, proposing that Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University would be built at Fursatganj with an aim to give better training facilities to the pilots. He also announced the expansion of Fursatganj airport, so that farmers' produce can be exported. The announcement was made at a function to mark the 25th anniversary of Indira Gandhi National Aviation Academy (IGRUA), a premier academy of pilot training in India, where Vayalar Ravi was also present. On 17 October, during the International Civil Aviation Conference in Mumbai, Ravi had announced the plans for the university. Since then, he is believed to be pitching hard for the institution to come to his home turf. MiD DAY had reported ('Kerala to host world class aviation school', 19 October) that during discussions for the project, debates supported that the university should be located between northern and western India, but the aviation minister was of a view that the university must be established in Kerala. Official confirmation Talking to MiD DAY, Nasim Zaidi, union civil aviation secretary, said, Yes, it has been decided that the university would be built at Fursatganj in UP and its campus will be close to IGRUA at Fursatganj airfield. Despite repeated attempts, Ravi remained unavailable for comment. In order to minimise the scarcity of aviation professionals in the country, the Civil Aviation Ministry mooted the idea of the first aviation university. Proposed extension of the airport The aviation ministry has decided that Airports Authority of India will extend the 6,000-ft-long runway at the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) at Raebareli to make it fit for bigger jets. And AAI will also construct a passenger terminal to have an airport to replace what is only a flying academy now. Extension of runway The decision was taken at IGRUA in a meeting that Rahul had with then aviation minister Vayalar Ravi (Ajit Singh, also from UP, was sworn in as aviation minister on Sunday), aviation secretary Nasim Zaidi and other top officials. The runway is currently 6,000 ft which will be extended to 7,500 ft and then 9,000 ft in the second stage, said sources. Estimated cost The estimated cost for the 7,500-ft runway and terminal is Rs 150 crore and it will cost another Rs 100 crore for expanding it, said sources. While a proposal for funding this would be sent to the Planning Commission, aviation authorities estimate that about 350 acres would be needed. The move is expected to lead to economic development - and rich political harvest - as Raebareli could become the fifth city in UP to have an airport after Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra and Kanpur.

The Saunstha has a student community of over 2,500. It runs three elementary schools, one high school, one junior college, and one technical school. The Saunstha operates from its main building in the heart of the Panaji city on Dr Dada Vaidya Road. The Mushtifund Middle School operates from the Fontainhas (quarter) campus. Etymology The word \\"Mushtifund\\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \\"Mushti\\" for \\"fist\\" and the English word \\"fund\\" for \\"funds\\".  History  The history of the institution dates back more than a hundred years. In 1908, a handful of locals gathered to found an educational society to propagate knowledge and elementary education using Marathi as a medium of instruction. This resulted in what we know today as the Mushtifund Saunstha. Funding was not easy to find for such a society so a handful of rice instead of cash was collected from Goan households, and sold it in the markets in exchange for cash to run the Saunstha. This explains the name \\"Mushtifund\\", which means, funds collected in handfuls. During the 1970s only 4 classes were taught. As of 2016, the institution provides education for students from Kindergarten all the way to 12th grade (Mushtifund Higher Secondary).  Sections   Mushtifund Primary School  Mushtifund Primary offers schooling from kindergarten to 4th grade. There are two subdivisions for the primary section, one with the medium of instruction as Marathi, the other to be English. This offers children brought up in a traditional environment to build up their level without lagging behind due to language concerns.The Mushtifund Saunstha Main School Building  Mushtifund High School  Mushtifund High School is the largest section of Mushtifund Saunstha. It includes grades 5 to 10, the common high school levels in the Education system in India. The high school section now has more than 20 classes with more than 600 students enrolled. Mushtifund High School was primarily based in the institution's main building in the capital city of Panjim. As of the academic year of 2016-2017, the school will be shifting its premises to the newly built multi-school complex at Cujira, Bambolim. The school is affiliated to the Goa Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education, and follows a NCERT pattern. = Transportation = The school provides school buses as a part of the \\"Bal Rath\\" scheme for students from far locations. This service is free for the students, with 3 buses being operated at the moment. This will increase as the school shifts to its new school complex at Cujira.  Mushtifund Higher Secondary School  The Mushtifund Higher Secondary School is a senior high school in the city of Panaji. It offers senior high school programs in two majors‚Äîscience and commerce. Its science section has an admissions procedure that accepts only the cream of the student community. The school is among the reputed senior high schools in the state, and has a record of producing Board toppers in either discipline.

Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974, It can be considered as the extension of the Rutherford-Bohr-Sommerfeld atom model to multi-electron atoms. Introduction Illustration of the vector model of orbital angular momentum. The model is a convenient representation of the angular momenta of the electrons in the atom. Angular momentum is always split into orbital L, spin S and total J: :\\\\mathbf{J}=\\\\mathbf{L}+\\\\mathbf{S}. Given that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized and there is an uncertainty relation for the components of each vector, the representation turns out to be quite simple (although the background mathematics is quite complex). Geometrically it is a discrete set of right-circular cones, without the circular base, in which the axes of all the cones are lined up onto a common axis, conventionally the z-axis for three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.Physical chemistry, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1978, Following is the background to this construction. Mathematical background of angular momenta Cones of spin angular momentum, here shown for a spin-1/2 particle The commutator implies that for each of L, S, and J, only one component of any angular momentum vector can be measured at any instant of time; at the same the other two are indeterminate. The commutator of any two angular momentum operators (corresponding to component directions) is non-zero. Following is a summary of the relevant mathematics in constructing the vector model. The commutation relations are (using the Einstein summation convention): : \\\\begin{align} & [\\\\hat{L}_a, \\\\hat{L}_b ] = i \\\\hbar \\\\varepsilon_{abc} \\\\hat{L}_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ & [\\\\hat{S}_a, \\\\hat{S}_b ] = i \\\\hbar \\\\varepsilon_{abc} \\\\hat{S}_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where *L = (L1, L2, L3), S = (S1, S2, S3) and J = (J1, J2, J3) (these correspond to L = (Lx, Ly, Lz), S = (Sx, Sy, Sz) and J = (Jx, Jy, Jz) in Cartesian coordinates), *a, b, c ‚àä {1,2,3} are indices labelling the components of angular momenta *Œµabc is the 3-index permutation tensor in 3-d. The magnitudes of L, S and J however can be measured at the same time, since the commutation of the square of an angular momentum operator (full resultant, not components) with any one component is zero, so simultaneous measurement of \\\\hat{L}_a with \\\\hat{L}^2, \\\\hat{S}_a with \\\\hat{S}^2 and \\\\hat{J}_a with \\\\hat{J}^2 satisfy: : \\\\begin{align} & [\\\\hat{L}_a, \\\\hat{L}^2] = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ & [\\\\hat{S}_a, \\\\hat{S}^2] = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ & [\\\\hat{J}_a, \\\\hat{J}^2] = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The magnitudes satisfy all of the following, in terms of operators and vector components: :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\hat{L}^2 = \\\\hat{L}_x^2 + \\\\hat{L}_y^2 +\\\\hat{L}_z^2 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{L}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{L}= L^2 = L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\hat{S}^2 = \\\\hat{S}_x^2 + \\\\hat{S}_y^2 +\\\\hat{S}_z^2 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{S}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{S}= S^2 = S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\hat{J}^2 = \\\\hat{J}_x^2 + \\\\hat{J}_y^2 +\\\\hat{J}_z^2 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{J}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}= J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} and quantum numbers: :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{\\\\ell(\\\\ell+1)}, \\\\quad L_z = m_\\\\ell \\\\hbar, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{s(s+1)}, \\\\quad S_z = m_s \\\\hbar, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{j(j+1)}, \\\\quad J_z = m_j \\\\hbar, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where * \\\\scriptstyle \\\\ell , is the azimuthal quantum number, *s, is the spin quantum number intrinsic to the type of particle, *j, is the total angular momentum quantum number, which respectively take the values: :\\\\begin{align} & m_\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ -\\\\ell, -(\\\\ell-1) \\\\cdots \\\\ell-1, \\\\ell \\\\\\\\} , \\\\quad \\\\ell \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 0,1 \\\\cdots n-1 \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & m_s \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ -s, -(s-1) \\\\cdots s-1, s \\\\\\\\} , \\\\\\\\\\\\ & m_j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ -j, -(j-1) \\\\cdots j-1, j \\\\\\\\} , \\\\\\\\\\\\ & m_j=m_\\\\ell+m_s, \\\\quad j=\\\\ell+s\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} These mathematical facts suggest the continuum of all possible angular momenta for a corresponding specified quantum number: #One direction is constant, the other two are variable. #The magnitude of the vectors must be constant (for a specified state corresponding to the quantum number), so the two indeterminate components of each of the vectors must be confined to a circle, in such a way that the measurable and un-measurable components (at an instant of time) allow the magnitudes to be constructed correctly, for all possible indeterminate components. The geometrical result is a cone of vectors, the vector starts at the apex of the cone and its tip reaches the circumference of the cone. It is convention to use the z-component for the measurable component of angular momentum, so the axis of the cone must be the z-axis, directed from the apex to the plane defined by the circular base of the cone, perpendicular to the plane. For different quantum numbers, the cones are different. So there are a discrete number of states the angular momenta can be, ruled by the above possible values for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\ell, s, and j. Using the previous set-up of the vector as part of a cone, each state must correspond to a cone. This is for increasing \\\\scriptstyle \\\\ell, s, and j, and decreasing \\\\scriptstyle \\\\ell, s, and j> Negative quantum numbers correspond to cones reflected in the x-y plane. One of these states, for a quantum number equal to zero, clearly doesn't correspond to a cone, only a circle in the x-y plane. The number of cones (including the degenerate planar circle) equals the multiplicity of states, \\\\scriptstyle 2\\\\ell+1. Bohr model It can be considered the extension of the Bohr model because Niels Bohr also proposed angular momentum was quantized according to: : L = m\\\\hbar where m is an integer, produced correct results for the Hydrogen atom. Although the Bohr model doesn't apply to multi-electron atoms, it was the first successful quantization of angular momentum applied to the atom, preceding the vector model of the atom. Addition of angular momenta For one-electron atoms (i.e. hydrogen), there is only one set of cones for the orbiting electron. For multi-electron atoms, there are many states, due to the increasing number of electrons. The angular momenta of all electrons in the atom add vectorially. Most atomic processes, both nuclear and chemical (electronic) ‚Äì except in the absolutely stochastic process of radioactive decay - are determined by spin- pairing and coupling of angular momenta due to neighbouring nucleons and electrons. The term \\"coupling\\" in this context means the vector superposition of angular momenta, that is, magnitudes and directions are added. In multi- electron atoms, the vector sum of two angular momenta is: : \\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\mathbf{J}_1 + \\\\mathbf{J}_2 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! for the z-component, the projected values are: : J_z = J_{1z} + J_{2z} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\mathbf{J}_z = m_j \\\\hbar \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{J}_{1z} = m_{j_1} \\\\hbar \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{J}_{2z} = m_{j_2} \\\\hbar \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! and the magnitudes are: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\hbar\\\\sqrt{j(j+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{J}_1 = \\\\hbar\\\\sqrt{j_1(j_1+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{J}_2 = \\\\hbar\\\\sqrt{j_2(j_2+1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} in which : j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ j_1 - j_2, j_1 - j_2 - 1 \\\\cdots j_1 + j_2 - 1, j_1 + j_2 \\\\\\\\} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! This process may be repeated for a third electron, then the fourth etc. until the total angular momentum has been found. LS coupling Illustration of L-S coupling. Total angular momentum J is purple, orbital L is blue, and spin S is green. The process of adding all angular momenta together is a laborious task, since the resultant momenta is not definite, the entire cones of precessing momenta about the z-axis must be incorporated into the calculation. This can be simplified by some developed approximations - such as the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme in L-S coupling, named after H. N. Russell and F. A. Saunders (1925).

Pierce was born in Yorkshire (Cattaraugus County), New York in 1831, studied at the Mendon Academy in Monroe County, New York, and settled in Adams County, Wisconsin in 1854, taking up practice as a lawyer in the county seat of Friendship when he was admitted to the bar in 1858. He was first elected district attorney of Adams County in 1861, and the same year (with several associates) founded the Adams County Press, just a few weeks after the outbreak of the US Civil War. Pierce remained as editor and publisher of this newspaper (one of the first published in Adams County) for the majority of the next 40 years until his death in 1903. In 1864 Pierce enlisted in the Union army, was commissioned a first lieutenant, and saw action (with the regiments that made up the 9th Army Corps, Army of the Potomac) at the Siege of Petersburg, among other battles toward the end of the Civil War. These experiences formed the basis of his 1866 book Battle Fields and Camp Fires of the 38th Regiment, published by the Daily Wisconsin Printing House of Milwaukee. After his honorable discharge in 1865, Pierce resumed his law practice and newspaper duties, serving several years as county judge, and beginning in 1870 was elected as a legislator to the Wisconsin Assembly, being re-elected to the same body in 1877, 1878, 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1897. He served as chairman of the Assembly's judiciary committee in 1880, 1881, and 1882. As Adams County district attorney in 1892, he instituted the first successful gerrymander suit in the state of Wisconsin. He is also credited with being the author of an 1882 amendment to the Wisconsin state constitution which provided for biennial elections of legislators.http://www.wiroots.org/wiadams/solonpierce.html Pierce died at his home in Friendship.

It was based on Another Bullshit Night in Suck City, a 2004 memoir by Nick Flynn. Plot Nick Flynn (Dano) is an aspiring writer who works at a homeless shelter where his estranged father Jonathan (De Niro) is a client. Jonathan, an alcoholic ex-con and self-proclaimed \\"master storyteller\\", left Nick's mother Jody (Moore) years earlier to raise Nick on her own. She eventually committed suicide, for which Nick feels responsible. Jonathan gets into fights with the other clients, and Nick is tempted to throw him out. Nick and Jonathan get into an intense argument, during which Jonathan tells Nick that they are the same. The stress of seeing his father again drives Nick to drink heavily and abuse drugs, costing him his relationship with his girlfriend and coworker, Denise (Olivia Thirlby). Jonathan eventually gets kicked out of the shelter, with Nick voting with the staff for his removal. Nick tries to numb the guilt by smoking crack, but the drug only intensifies his pain, and he realizes that he has a problem. He enters a rehabilitation program, and makes amends with Denise. One night, he finds Jonathan sleeping on the street and invites him to stay with him. When they part ways the next day, Jonathan tells Nick that he is not responsible for his mother's suicide, and that they are not the same after all. Nick becomes a teacher, starts a family, and publishes a book of his poetry, while Jonathan qualifies for Section 8 housing thanks to Nick's recommendation. Jonathan shows his appreciation by letting Nick read his \\"masterpiece\\", Memoirs of a Moron, which Jonathan finds to be initially promising, but ultimately falling short - much like Jonathan himself. He invites Jonathan to his poetry reading, where he introduces his father to his wife and infant daughter. After some hesitation, he allows Jonathan to hold his daughter.

United States, 122 U.S. 543 (1887), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States determined that the president cannot delegate the power vested in him to approve the proceedings and sentence of a court-martial because the president is the only person bestowed with the judicial power of making a final determination.. Background Benjamin Piatt Runkle, a Civil War veteran who was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, was, from 1867 to 1870, serving as an active duty army major and disbursing officer in the Freedmen's Bureau for the State of Kentucky. In 1870, he was placed on the retired list as a major, but continued as a disbursing officer, until he was arrested and tried before a court-martial. The court-martial found Runkle guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and of violating the March 2, 1863, c. 67, ¬ß 1, Act of Congress. His sentence was imprisonment, payment of a fine, and dismissal from the army, where he had been serving on the retired list and drawing retired pay. The Secretary of War, W. W. Belknap, reviewed the proceedings and in 1873 issued an order approving Runkle's conviction, but in consideration of his war service and wounds, granted Runkle executive clemency in the name of the President and eliminated the fine and prison sentence. However, his dismissal from the army remained in effect. Under the law at that time, any court martial sentence involving an officer's dismissal in peacetime needed to be confirmed by the President and there was no indication in this order that the conviction was confirmed by President Ulysses S. Grant. On the same day that he was cashiered, Runkle petitioned President Grant, complaining that his sentence had not been confirmed by the President himself. This petition was referred by Grant to the Judge Advocate General for review. It remained open when President Rutherford B. Hayes came into office, as President Grant had done nothing further in the matter. Hayes then picked it up as unfinished business and registered an order of disapproval, revoking the 1873 order dismissing Runkle. The August 4, 1877 executive order of President Hayes, disapproving the conviction, details the history: Benjamin Piatt Runkle On the authority of the executive order, Runkle was given retirement pay ‚Äì both from the date of the Hayes order going forward and back pay to the date he was dismissed. In 1882, he made a claim for additional longevity pay, which was referred to the Court of Claims. In the Court of Claims the government challenged his right to any pay at all, asserting that Hayes did not have the right to revoke the 1873 order confirming Runkle's dismissal. Opinion of the Court The opinion of the Court, delivered by Chief Justice Waite, concludes: Subsequent developments Subsequent cases, United States v. Fletcher, 148 U.S. 84 (1893). and Bishop v. United States, 197 U.S. 334 (1905),. both, in effect, repudiate the Runkle decision, in that the Runkle circumstances were so exceptional that it is not a safe precedent.

The title of the book is derived from its opening words of the first teaching.Preface to Tzavaat HaRivash for the New Edition, by Rabbi Jacob Immanuel Schochet. (Hebrew) The work was not penned by the Baal Shem Tov himself, but rather compiled by his disciples and followers.Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh, beg. ch. 25 (translated from Hebrew): Tzavaat HaRivash... which is actually not his \\"Testament\\" [at all]. And he did not instruct anything at all before his passing; rather, they are his pure, collected sayings, which were collected anthology after anthology.  Teachings   Subduing physical desires and the evil inclination  The book calls for a high degree of self-mastery. In repeated instances, the Baal Shem Tov urges constant attachment to the Divine and separation from unnecessary physical matters.Teaching 5: One should attach one's thoughts Above, and not eat or drink more than is sufficient, and not indulge himself but for that which is healthy for himself. He should not look at things of the world, nor think of them at all; he should rather try in all things to separate himself from physicality... And it is written regarding the Tree of Knowledge \\"desirable to the sight and good for eating\\" - that because of seeing, it was desired. Even when involved with worldly affairs, one should consider the higher worlds to be his true home and long to return there as soon as the necessary business is finished. Although the book was written for those who still felt attachment to physical desires, it teaches that one should strive to distance oneself from them to the point of being actually disgusted by them.Teaching 9: And if thoughts of worldly lusts come to him, he should distance them from his thoughts and abandon the lust until he hates them and is disgusted by them. He should accustom his good inclination to over[power] the evil inclination and his lusts, and in this way subdue them.  Avoiding pride  Tzavaat HaRivash considers pride to be an evil trait: \\"If one sees that his [Divine] service is greater than that of his fellow, he should not become proud, Heaven forbid! As it says in Otiot DeRabi Akiva, 'Let him not say in his heart, \\"I am greater than my fellow\\" ' \\" (Teaching 48). A way to avoid this is to constantly be involved with Divine service at every single moment, so that there is no time to become proud (Teaching 52). One possible source of pride is Torah study itself, because there is a danger that the evil inclination will tell him to learn the detailed laws, but in such a way as to avoid fear of Heaven (Teaching 117). To counteract this, one should interrupt his Torah study, rest a little and meditate every hour in order to reattach oneself to G‚Äëd (Teaching 39).  Prayer  The Baal Shem Tov attached extremely high importance to daily prayer. In line with his belief that one should serve G‚Äëd \\"with all his power\\" (Teaching 3), he considered it \\"a great kindness from G‚Äëd, may He be blessed, that a man lives after prayer, because according to the ways of nature, he should have died from expending his strength in prayer\\" (Teaching 35 and 57, also see 42). Nevertheless, prayer should be recited quietly (Teaching 33). Because prayer takes so much energy, the Baal Shem Tov discouraged reciting too many psalms before the main body of prayer, out of fear that one might deplete his strength to the point that he cannot complete the required part of the daily service. Rather, additional psalms and the Song of Songs should be recited afterwards, if he still has strength (Teaching 38). When praying, one is to either look in the siddur or to close one's eyes. The Baal Shem Tov teaches that looking at the letters themselves helps to improve concentration when one is on a lower level of inspiration. When one is cleaving to the higher worlds, however, it is better to close the eyes to maintain the inspiration (Teaching 40).  Being joyful and avoiding depression  Tzavaat HaRivash on several occasions stresses that one should avoid sadness as much as possible, because this is a ploy by the evil inclination to cause one to stop serving G‚Äëd (Teachings 44-46). On the contrary, one should serve G‚Äëd with joy (Teaching 45 and 46, cf. Psalms 100:2). In particular, prayer is much greater and more potent amidst joy than in sadness and crying (Teaching 107). Further, a son's intense love and joy has the power to dispel his father's anger; the same is true with Israel and G‚Äëd (Teaching 132).  Constant Divine connection  The book also teaches that one must constantly think about holy things (Teaching 81). \\"Even when going to the lavatory, he should think, 'Am I not separating bad from good?'... And when one goes to sleep, one should think, 'My mind (mochin) will go to the blessed Holy One and be strengthened for His service, may He be blessed.' \\" (Teaching 22)  Accuracy  Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi was a contemporary of the Baal Shem Tov and a student of his foremost pupil, the Maggid of Mezritch. He writes that while Tzavaat HaRivash was written in Hebrew, the Baal Shem Tov actually didn't teach in Hebrew but rather in Yiddish. Also, those who compiled the Baal Shem Tov's teachings \\"did not know how to determine the phraseology exactly in its proper fashion.\\" Rabbi Schneur Zalman in fact takes issue with a certain word in Tzavaat HaRivash (sharta, dwelled, in the context of the descent of the Shechinah) and asserts that the Baal Shem Tov actually meant nitlavsha, \\"clothed Itself\\" (in a state of exile, as opposed to dwelling there as in a home). Nevertheless, he affirms that \\"the connotation is absolutely true.\\"Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh, ch. 25 Over time, textual variants appeared among the manuscripts. Sometimes the changes were very small differences in individual words. Other times, new material (sometimes attributed to the Maggid of Mezeritch or other students of the Baal Shem Tov) was inserted, yielding more information.

In the same year he started as head of a research group at the Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology in Freiburg and assumed in 1994 a professorship for Cell Biology at the medical school of the University of M√ºnster. In 1999 he assumed the position of a director at the Max-Planck-Institute of physiological and clinical research, which he held until 2001 when he became the director of the newly founded Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in M√ºnster. Research Vestweber has worked in three different areas of molecular biology. During his studies for his PhD in the laboratory of Rolf Kemler he investigated the molecular mechanisms of cell recognition and cell adhesion between epithelial cells and during the development of the mouse preimplantation embryo, working on the adhesion molecule E-cadherin (uvomorulin). In the course of his postdoctoral work in the group of Gottfried Schatz at the Biocenter in Basel, Vestweber studied the biogenesis of mitochondria and found the first membrane component (today known as TOM 40) of the mitochondrial import machinery for the transport of proteins into this organelle. Since 1990 he investigates molecular mechanisms that control inflammation. Inflammation relies on the entry of leukocytes from the blood into infected or otherwise damaged tissues. Vestweber studies with his group the molecular basis for cell recognition, cell adhesion and cell migration, which mediate and control this process. At present the group focuses in this context on mechanisms that control the barrier function of the vascular endothelium and the blood vessel wall. The nearly 200 of Vestweber's publications were cited over 14,000 times. His Hirsch-Index is 73 (status December 2011).

Journal of the Arnold Arboretum 45(4): plate IV (4), figures 30-34 line drawings of Ambrosia deltoidea; figure captions on page 429 Description Ambrosia deltoidea is a shrub growing from a taproot with many lateral and adventitious roots. The plant produces many thin branches growing up to about half a meter tall. It generally has many dead branches tangled in the living crown. It is drought-deciduous. The leaves are no more than 2 centimeters long. The branches and new leaves are coated thinly in woolly fibers; the leaves become hairless with age. The inflorescence is a spike of several staminate flower heads. There are often some pistillate heads just below these, with some pistillate heads borne on lateral branches. The fruit is an achene covered in spines. The achenes are usually dispersed when they stick to animals. The plant has been observed to have a lifespan of about 50 years. Uses This plant acts as a nurse plant for other species, providing shade and increased soil nitrogen for young growing plants. It also protects seedlings from herbivory. It is the main nurse plant for saguaro in Organ Pipe National Monument. It also serves as nurse plant for yellow paloverde, ocotillo, and some prickly pear species. Most bursage plants are associated with a perennial plant. This plant is not palatable to mammals and it is not grazed by livestock.

This category of fossils has traditionally included robust or thick-walled entities such as plant spores, acritarchs and chitinozoa, but the term 'SCFs' is usually applied to more fragile remnants of animals that can only be extracted through a delicate maceration technique. SCFs are relatively widespread and abundant, and can potentially preserve both mineralized and non-mineralized parts of organisms. Since SCFs can preserve the remains of non-biomineralized organisms, they have been viewed as a relatively untapped record of animal evolution, which has the potential to circumvent some of the biases of the shelly fossil record.  Extraction  SCFs are typically preserved in fine- grained siliciclastic rocks, and are too small to be fruitfully examined on bedding planes. Instead, they are extracted by dissolving the rock in acid. Traditional palynological preparations involve high-energy steps such as centrifuging that destroy large and fragile fossils. In the more delicate technique pioneered by Butterfield, individual microfossils are picked from sieved acid residues by hand. The sieving stage removes crystalline residue, making it easier to extract fossils, but introduces a filter: the smallest fossils (<~40 ¬µm) pass through the sieve and are lost. Once extracted, fossils can be mounted for light or scanning electron microscopy: transmitted light illuminates internal microstructures, whereas SEM picks out surface features.  Preservation  SCFs are best preserved in environments that had anoxic conditions and where the sediments have not been subject to high temperatures (limited thermal maturity); the presence of oxygen is particularly deleterious at high temperatures.  Biota  Scanning electron micrograph of a late Silurian chitinozoan, an enigmatic Palaeozoic SCF that can be recovered by the standard palynological technique. Scale bar: 50 ¬µm Traditional palynological methods are designed for extracting fossilized plant spores and other resistant organic microfossils such as acritarchs and chitinozoa. By using the modified SCFs extraction technique, more delicate fossil structures can also be recovered, including fragments of animals. In particular, this technique has been applied to sediments deposited during the Cambrian Period, since there is great interest in tracking how soft-bodied animals evolved during this time interval. Animal SCFs extracted from Cambrian sediments include the minute scales of priapulid worms, Wiwaxia sclerites, and arthropod feeding parts, for example. These organisms are not represented in the conventional (shelly) fossil record, and so the SCFs record provides data on their distribution and evolution that would not otherwise be available. Lagerst√§tten such as the Burgess Shale provide isolated snapshots of Palaeozoic life, whereas SCFs provide a more continuous record, albeit blighted by the fragmentary (and consequently enigmatic) nature of many of its constituents. As such, SCFs can help to fill in some of the details of the fossil record outside the rare Lagerst√§tten sites: for instance, highlighting the rapid nature of the Cambrian explosion.

The story deals with growing surrogacy practices in India where women are used as surrogates by foreigners. The film is an emotional drama telling the story of one such surrogate mother who bears a foreigner's child. The film is critically acclaimed and won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi in 2011. It was remade in 2013 in Telugu as Welcome Obama ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr4Z-HS_GoU with Urmila Kanitkar again playing the role of Yashoda. The film would be remade in Hindi as Mimi, directed by Laxman Utekar and produced by Dinesh Vijan. Plot Mary comes looking to India for a surrogate mother to bear a child. She finds a poor woman Yashoda who accepts the offer. Yashoda gets pregnant successfully. But during her pregnancy, doctors inform Mary & Yashoda that due to some complications the child would probably be born with disabilities. Mary decides to quit through this and leaves India. Yashoda begs her to not leave. But she is then left alone with a child in her womb. Few years later Mary loses her patience and decided to come back and look for her child. The film shows the story in legal and emotional perspective of who should the child be with; his surrogate mother who raised him or his mother who has the blood relation with him.

Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the behavioural and social sciences, which draws primarily upon the research of sociologists, psychologists, philosophers, psychiatrists, biologists, social anthropologists, as well as scholars of law. The term criminology was coined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as . Later, French anthropologist Paul Topinard used the analogous French term . Paul Topinard's major work appeared in 1879. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the emphasis of criminology was on the reform of criminal law and not on the causes of crime. Scholars such as Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham, were more concerned with the humanitarian aspects in dealing with criminals and reforming several criminal laws. Great progress in criminology was made after the first quarter of the twentieth century. The first American textbook on criminology was written in 1920 by sociologist Maurice Parmalee under the title Criminology. Programmes were developed for the specific purpose of training students to be criminologists, but the development was rather slow. From 1900 through to 2000 the study underwent three significant phases in the United States: (1) Golden Age of Research (1900‚Äì1930) which has been described as a multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930‚Äì1960) which shows that there was no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory, and (3) a 1960‚Äì2000 period which was seen as a significant turning point for criminology. Criminologists are the people working and researching all of the ins and outs of criminology. Criminologists often look for behavioral patterns of a possible criminal in hopes of finding a particular perpetrator. They also conduct research and investigations, developing theories, and composing results, and more often than not solve crimes. The interests of criminologists include the study of nature of crime and criminals, origins of criminal law, etiology of crime, social reaction to crime, and the functioning of law enforcement agencies and the penal institutions. It can be broadly said that criminology directs its enquiries along three lines: first, it investigates the nature of criminal law and its administration and conditions under which it develops, second, it analyses the causation of crime and the personality of criminals; and third, it studies the control of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders. Thus, criminology includes within its scope the activities of legislative bodies, law- enforcement agencies, judicial institutions, correctional institutions and educational, private and public social agencies. Schools of thought Three women in the pillory, China, 1875 In the mid-18th century, criminology arose as social philosophers gave thought to crime and concepts of law. Over time, several schools of thought have developed. There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: Classical, Positivist, and Chicago. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, labeling, critical criminology, cultural criminology, postmodern criminology, feminist criminology and others discussed below. Classical The Classical school arose in the mid-18th century and has its basis in utilitarian philosophy. Cesare Beccaria, author of On Crimes and Punishments (1763‚Äì64), Jeremy Bentham (inventor of the panopticon), and other philosophers in this school argued: # People have free will to choose how to act. # The basis for deterrence is the idea humans are 'hedonists' who seek pleasure and avoid pain and 'rational calculators' who weigh the costs and benefits of every action. It ignores the possibility of irrationality and unconscious drives as 'motivators'. # Punishment (of sufficient severity) can deter people from crime, as the costs (penalties) outweigh benefits, and severity of punishment should be proportionate to the crime. # The more swift and certain the punishment, the more effective as a deterrent to criminal behavior. This school developed during a major reform in penology when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms, the French Revolution, and the development of the legal system in the United States. Positivist The Positivist school argues criminal behavior comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. Its key method of thought is that criminals are born as criminals not made into them; this school of thought also supports theory of nature in the debate between nature versus nurture. They also argue that criminal behavior is innate and within a person. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: biological, psychological and social positivism.David, Christian Carsten. \\"Criminology - Crime.\\" Cybercrime. Northamptonshire (UK), 5 June 1972. Web. 23 February 2012. . Biological positivism is the belief that these criminals and their criminal behavior stem from \\"chemical imbalances\\" or \\"abnormalities\\" within the brain or the DNA due to basic internal \\"defects\\". Psychological Positivism is the concept that criminal acts or the people doing said crimes do them because of internal factors driving them. It differs from biological positivism in the thought that that school of thought says criminals are born criminals, whereas the psychological perspective recognizes the internal factors are results of external factor such as, but are not limited to, abusive parents, abusive relationships, drug problems, etc. Social Positivism, which oftentimes referred to as Sociological Positivism, discusses the thought process that criminals are produced by society. This school claims that low income levels, high poverty/unemployment rates, and poor educational systems create and fuel criminals and crimes. = Criminal personality = The notion of having a criminal personality is derived from the school of thought of psychological positivism. It essentially means that parts of a person's personality have traits that align with many traits possessed by criminals, such as neuroticism, anti-social tendencies, and aggressive behaviors. There is no evidence of causation between these personality traits and criminal actions, but there is a correlation.: Italian Cesare Lombroso (1835‚Äì1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called \\"the father of criminology.\\" He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the Italian school of criminology. Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime. He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheekbones or hairline, or a cleft palate could indicate \\"atavistic\\" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of phrenology and by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, has been superseded. Enrico Ferri, a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories since control groups were not used in his studies. Compare: Sociological positivist Sociological positivism suggests societal factors such as poverty, membership of subcultures, or low levels of education can predispose people to crime. Adolphe Quetelet used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors. He found age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime. Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments, each one proving education reduces crime. Rawson W. Rawson used crime statistics to suggest a link between population density and crime rates, with crowded cities producing more crime. Joseph Fletcher and John Glyde read papers to the Statistical Society of London on their studies of crime and its distribution. Henry Mayhew used empirical methods and an ethnographic approach to address social questions and poverty, and gave his studies in London Labour and the London Poor. √âmile Durkheim viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people. Differential association (subcultural) Differential association (subcultural) posits that people learn crime through association. This theory was advocated by Edwin Sutherland, who focused on how \\"a person becomes delinquent because of an excess of definitions favorable to violation of law over definitions unfavorable to violation of law.\\" Associating with people who may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances makes one more likely to take that view, under his theory. Interacting with this type of \\"antisocial\\" peer is a major cause of delinquency. Reinforcing criminal behavior makes it chronic. Where there are criminal subcultures, many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas. Chicago The Chicago school arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of Robert E. Park, Ernest Burgess, and other urban sociologists at the University of Chicago. In the 1920s, Park and Burgess identified five concentric zones that often exist as cities grow, including the \\"zone of transition\\", which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder. In the 1940s, Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw focused on juvenile delinquents, finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition. The Chicago School was a school of thought developed that blames social structures for human behaviors. This thought can be associated or used within criminology, because it essentially takes the stance of defending criminals and criminal behaviors. The defense and argument lies in the thoughts that these people and their acts are not their faults but they are actually the result of society (i.e. unemployment, poverty, etc.), and these people are actually, in fact, behaving properly. Chicago school sociologists adopted a social ecology approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience a breakdown in the social structure and institutions, such as family and schools. This results in social disorganization, which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for deviant behavior. Other researchers suggested an added social- psychological link. Edwin Sutherland suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals with whom they may associate. Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include psychoanalysis, functionalism, interactionism, Marxism, econometrics, systems theory, postmodernism, genetics, neuropsychology, evolutionary psychology, etc. Social structure theories This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a conflict theory or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime. As this perspective is itself broad enough, embracing as it does a diversity of positions.Hester, S., Eglin, P. 1992, A Sociology of Crime, London, Routledge. =Disorganization= Social disorganization theory is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School. Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of population turnover. This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, ‚Äòsubcultures‚Äô or ‚Äògangs‚Äô. These groups have different values to the social norm. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population heterogeneity. With high turnover, informal social structure often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order in a community. =Ecology= Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories. Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration. As working and middle-class people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. William Julius Wilson suggested a poverty \\"concentration effect\\", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence. =Strain= Strain theory, also known as Mertonian Anomie, advanced by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity‚Äîas Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream, and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivator. Merton also used the term anomie, but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve. Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (such as gang members, or what he calls \\"hobos\\"). Robert Agnew developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as general strain theory\\". =Subcultural= Following the Chicago school and strain theory, and also drawing on Edwin Sutherland's idea of differential association, sub-cultural theorists focused on small cultural groups fragmenting away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life. Albert K. Cohen tied anomie theory with Sigmund Freud's reaction formation idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower-class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class. Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include \\"toughness\\" and disrespect for authority. Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture. Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin suggested that delinquency can result from a differential opportunity for lower class youth. Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as minimum wage-paying jobs available to them. Delinquency tends to occur among the lower-working-class males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas, as mentioned extensively by Albert Cohen (Cohen, 1965). Bias has been known to occur among law enforcement agencies, where officers tend to place a bias on minority groups, without knowing for sure if they had committed a crime or not. Delinquents may also commit crimes in order to secure funds for themselves or their loved ones, such as committing an armed robbery, as studied by many scholars (Briar & Piliavin). British sub-cultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of class, where some criminal activities were seen as \\"imaginary solutions\\" to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults. Sociologists such as Raymond D. Gastil have explored the impact of a Southern culture of honor on violent crime rates.Raymond D. Gastil, \\"Homicide and a Regional Culture of Violence,\\" American Sociological Review 36 (1971): 412-427. =Control= Another approach is made by the social bond or social control theory. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do not become criminal. Travis Hirschi identified four main characteristics: \\"attachment to others\\", \\"belief in moral validity of rules\\", \\"commitment to achievement\\", and \\"involvement in conventional activities\\". The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal). On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low self-control is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime. A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one. If the person cannot exert self- control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms. Social bonds, through peers, parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control. For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children, from those who are not delinquent, is the control exerted by parents or chaperonage. In addition, theorists such as David Matza and Gresham Sykes argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social-behavioral constraints through techniques of neutralization. =Psychoanalytic= Psychoanalysis is a psychological theory (and therapy) which regards the unconscious mind, repressed memories and trauma, as the key drivers of behavior, especially deviant behavior. Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his essay, Beyond the Pleasure Principle,. Freud suggested that unconscious impulses such as ‚Äòrepetition compulsion‚Äô and a ‚Äòdeath drive‚Äô can dominate a person's creativity, leading to self-destructive behavior. Phillida Rosnick, in the article Mental Pain and Social Trauma, posits a difference in the thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain which corresponds to them having thoughts and feelings which are not reflections of their true selves. There is enough correlation between this altered state of mind and criminality to suggest causation. Sander Gilman, in the article Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis, looks for evidence in the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system and suggests there is a direct link between an unconscious desire for pain or punishment and the impulse to commit crime or deviant acts. Symbolic interactionism Symbolic interactionism draws on the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and George Herbert Mead, as well as subcultural theory and conflict theory. This school of thought focused on the relationship between state, media, and conservative-ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the \\"significant other\\" in the less powerful groups' processes of generating meaning. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to \\"label\\" minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take the label on board, indulge in crime more readily, and become actors in the \\"self-fulfilling prophecy\\" of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by Howard Becker and Edwin Lemert, in the mid-20th century. Stanley Cohen developed the concept of \\"moral panic\\" describing the societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena (e.g. post-World War 2 youth cultures like the Mods and Rockers in the UK in 1964, AIDS epidemic and football hooliganism). Labeling theory Labeling theory refers to an individual who is labeled in a particular way and was studied in great detail by Becker. It arrives originally from sociology but is regularly used in criminological studies. It is said that when someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime. Even those who initially reject the label can eventually accept it as the label becomes more well known, particularly among their peers. This stigma can become even more profound when the labels are about deviancy, and it is thought that this stigmatization can lead to deviancy amplification. Malcolm Klein conducted a test which showed that labeling theory affected some youth offenders but not others. Traitor theory At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist Lonnie Athens developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. Richard Rhodes' Why They Kill describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories. Rational choice theory Cesare Beccaria Rational choice theory is based on the utilitarian, classical school philosophies of Cesare Beccaria, which were popularized by Jeremy Bentham. They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender. In Dei delitti e delle pene (On Crimes and Punishments, 1763‚Äì1764), Beccaria advocated a rational penology. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime; thus, the judge was simply to confirm his or her sentence to the law. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and sin, and advocated against the death penalty, as well as torture and inhumane treatments, as he did not consider them as rational deterrents. This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s with the writings of James Q. Wilson, Gary Becker's 1965 article Crime and PunishmentGary Becker, \\"Crime and Punishment\\", in Journal of Political Economy, vol. 76 (2), March‚ÄìApril 1968, p.196-217 and George Stigler's 1970 article The Optimum Enforcement of Laws.George Stigler, \\"The Optimum Enforcement of Laws\\", in Journal of Political Economy, vol.78 (3), May‚ÄìJune 1970, p. 526‚Äì536 Rational choice theory argues that criminals, like other people, weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms. They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors. Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing surveillance, one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance. With this perspective, crime prevention or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as target hardening. Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, law enforcement presence, added street lighting, and other measures, are effective in reducing crime. One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the panopticon), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which the measures required would cost the supermarket so much that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and classical liberalism have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable. Such rational choice theories, linked to neoliberalism, have been at the basics of crime prevention through environmental design and underpin the Market Reduction Approach to theft Sutton, M. Schneider, J. and Hetherington, S. (2001) Tackling Theft with the Market Reduction Approach. Crime Reduction Research Series paper 8. Home Office.

Tackling Burglary: Market Reduction Approach. Routine activity theory Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life. A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian. A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement. Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of \\"place manager\\" such as rental property managers who can take nuisance abatement measures. Biosocial theory Biosocial criminology is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as genetics, neuropsychology, and evolutionary psychology.Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate. Various theoretical frameworks such as evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory have sought to explain trends in criminality through the lens of evolutionary biology. Specifically, they seek to explain why criminality is so much higher in men than in women and why young men are most likely to exhibit criminal behavior. See also: genetics of aggression. Aggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: serotonin systems, catecholamine systems, and the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by stress, either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress. Marxist In 1968, young British sociologists formed the National Deviance Conference (NDC) group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. Ian Taylor, Paul Walton and Jock Young ‚Äì members of the NDC ‚Äì rejected previous explanations of crime and deviance. Thus, they decided to pursue a new Marxist criminological approach.Sparks, Richard F., \\"A Critique of Marxist Criminology.\\" Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 165. In The New Criminology, they argued against the biological \\"positivism\\" perspective represented by Lombroso, Hans Eysenck and Gordon Trasler.Sparks, Richard F., \\"A Critique of Marxist Criminology.\\" Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 169. According to the Marxist perspective on crime, \\"defiance is normal ‚Äì the sense that men are now consciously involved [...] in assuring their human diversity.\\" Thus Marxists criminologists argued in support of society in which the facts of human diversity, be it social or personal, would not be criminalized.Sparks, Richard F., \\"A Critique of Marxist Criminology.\\" Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 170 - 171 They further attributed the processes of crime creation not to genetic or psychological facts, but rather to the material basis of a given society.J. B. Charles, C. W. G. Jasperse, K. A. van Leeuwen-Burow. \\"Criminology Between the Rule of Law and the Outlaws.\\" (1976). Deventer: Kluwer D.V. 116 Convict Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of criminology. Convict criminologists have been directly affected by the criminal justice system, oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminology such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional criminology can better be understood by those who lived in the walls of a prison. Martin Leyva argues that \\"prisonization\\" oftentimes begins before prison, in the home, community, and schools. According to Rod Earle, Convict Criminology started in the United States after the major expansion of prisons in the 1970s, and the U.S still remains the main focus for those who study convict criminology. Queer Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on LGBT individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The goals of this field of study are as follows: * To better understand the history of LGBT individuals and the laws put against the community * Why LGBT citizens are incarcerated and if or why they are arrested at higher rates than heterosexual and cisgender individuals * How queer activists have fought against oppressive laws that criminalized LGBT individuals * To conduct research and use it as a form of activism through education Legitimacy of Queer criminology: The value of pursuing criminology from a queer theorist perspective is contested; some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole, and as a result is a subject that lacks a wide berth of research available. On the other hand, it could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to \\"queer\\" the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT communities to liberating and protecting them.Ball, Matthew. \\"Queer Criminology as Activism.\\" Critical Criminology 24.4 (2016): 473-87. Web. 5 April 2018  Cultural  Cultural criminology views crime and its control within the context of culture. Ferrell believes criminologists can examine the actions of criminals, control agents, media producers, and others to construct the meaning of crime. He discusses these actions as a means to show the dominant role of culture. Kane adds that cultural criminology has three tropes; village, city street, and media, in which males can be geographically influenced by society's views on what is broadcast and accepted as right or wrong. The village is where one engages in available social activities. Linking the history of an individual to a location can help determine social dynamics. The city street involves positioning oneself in the cultural area. This is full of those affected by poverty, poor health and crime, and large buildings that impact the city but not neighborhoods. Mass media gives an all- around account of the environment and the possible other subcultures that could exist beyond a specific geographical area. It was later that Naegler and Salman introduced feminist theory to cultural criminology and discussed masculinity and femininity, sexual attraction and sexuality, and intersectional themes. Naegler and Salman believed that Ferrell's mold was limited and that they could add to the understanding of cultural criminology by studying women and those who do not fit Ferrell's mold. Hayward would later add that not only feminist theory, but green theory as well, played a role in the cultural criminology theory through the lens of adrenaline, the soft city, the transgressive subject, and the attentive gaze. The adrenaline lens deals with rational choice and what causes a person to have their own terms of availability, opportunity, and low levels of social control. The soft city lens deals with reality outside of the city and the imaginary sense of reality: the world where transgression occurs, where rigidity is slanted, and where rules are bent. The transgressive subject refers to a person who is attracted to rule-breaking and is attempting to be themselves in a world where everyone is against them. The attentive gaze is when someone, mainly an ethnographer, is immersed into the culture and interested in lifestyle(s) and the symbolic, aesthetic, and visual aspects. When examined, they are left with the knowledge that they are not all the same, but come to a settlement of living together in the same space. Through it all, sociological perspective on cultural criminology theory attempts to understand how the environment an individual is in determines their criminal behavior. Relative deprivation Relative deprivation involves the process where an individual measures his or her own well-being and materialistic worth against that of other people and perceive that they are worse off in comparison. When humans fail to obtain what they believe they are owed, they can experience anger or jealousy over the notion that they have been wrongly disadvantaged. Relative deprivation was originally utilized in the field of sociology by Samuel A. Stouffer, who was a pioneer of this theory. Stouffer revealed that soldiers fighting in World War II measured their personal success by the experience in their units rather than by the standards set by the military. Relative deprivation can be made up of societal, political, economic, or personal factors which create a sense of injustice. It is not based on absolute poverty, a condition where one cannot meet a necessary level to maintain basic living standards. Rather, relative deprivation enforces the idea that even if a person is financially stable, he or she can still feel relatively deprived. The perception of being relatively deprived can result in criminal behavior and/or morally problematic decisions. Relative deprivation theory has increasingly been used to partially explain crime as rising living standards can result in rising crime levels. In criminology, the theory of relative deprivation explains that people who feel jealous and discontent of others might turn to crime to acquire the things that they can not afford.  Rural  Rural criminology is the study of crime trends outside of metropolitan and suburban areas. Rural criminologists have used social disorganization and routine activity theories. The FBI Uniform Crime Report shows that rural communities have significantly different crime trends as opposed to metropolitan and suburban areas. The crime in rural communities consists predominantly of narcotic related crimes such as the production, use, and trafficking of narcotics. Social disorganization theory is used to examine the trends involving narcotics.Bunei, E. K., & Barasa, B. (2017). \\"Farm Crime Victimisation in Kenya: A Routine Activity Approach.\\" International Journal of Rural Criminology, 3(2), 224-249. Social disorganization leads to narcotic use in rural areas because of low educational opportunities and high unemployment rates. Routine activity theory is used to examine all low-level street crimes such as theft.Stallwitz, A. (2014). \\"Community-Mindedness: Protection against Crime in the Context of Illicit Drug Cultures?\\" International Journal of Rural Criminology, 2(2), 166-208. Much of the crime in rural areas is explained through routine activity theory because there is often a lack of capable guardians in rural areas.  Public  Public criminology is a strand within criminology closely tied with \\"public sociology,\\" focused on disseminating criminological insights to a broader audience than academia. Advocates of public criminology argue that criminologists should be \\"conducting and disseminating research on crime, law, and deviance in dialogue with affected communities.\\" Its goal is for academics and researchers in criminology to provide their research to the public in order to inform public decisions and policymaking. Types and definitions of crime Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society. Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon. However, there are two types of laws: *Natural laws are rooted in core values shared by many cultures. Natural laws protect against harm to persons (e.g. murder, rape, assault) or property (theft, larceny, robbery), and form the basis of common law systems. * Statutes are enacted by legislatures and reflect current cultural mores, albeit that some laws may be controversial, e.g. laws that prohibit cannabis use and gambling. Marxist criminology, conflict criminology, and critical criminology claim that most relationships between state and citizen are non- consensual and, as such, criminal law is not necessarily representative of public beliefs and wishes: it is exercised in the interests of the ruling or dominant class. The more right-wing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual social contract between state and citizen. Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural norms and mores, but may be broadly classified as a blue-collar crime, corporate crime, organized crime, political crime, public order crime, state crime, state-corporate crime, and white-collar crime. However, there have been moves in contemporary criminological theory to move away from liberal pluralism, culturalism, and postmodernism by introducing the universal term \\"harm\\" into the criminological debate as a replacement for the legal term \\"crime\\".Hillyard, P., Pantazis, C., Tombs, S., & Gordon, D.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 25, 2011. History The Ontonagon School was originally constructed in 1912 as a high school, and was designed by architect Derrick Hubert. The school was officially opened at the start of the 1913-1914 school year. Much of the building was rebuilt following a fire in 1929. In 1938, a two-story addition for elementary schooling, designed by architect A.B. Nelson of the Warren S. Holmes Company, was constructed next to the original high school building. The addition was connected to the original building on the southeast side via an annex corridor. A third single-story section of the building was constructed in 1967 to expand the school to meet the needs of the local population. The third building section was connected to the second section on the southeast side. Also in 1967, the high school moved to another building (located on Parker Avenue) and the entire structure was used as an elementary school. The school was in continuous use until 2010, when the district consolidated all grades into the building on Parker Avenue. In December 2011, the Ontonagon school board accepted an offer, made by an undisclosed private party, to purchase the building. Description The Ontonagon School consists of three connected buildings, constructed in 1912, 1938 and 1967. The 1938 addition is the most historically significant. This addition, constructed to house grade school children, was designed to be child-friendly. The building features stained-glass art, elaborate floor and wall tiling depicting fairytale characters, built-in child-sized benches, and reversing blackboards. The kindergarten room features a gingerbread entryway with coachlamps on each side, tilework with the Big Bad Wolf chasing the Three Little Pigs, and an Art Deco fish pond with fountain. On the second floor is a small children's theatre with a stage. The school district discontinued use of this building after 2010 when the K-12 population was consolidated into the Ontonagon Area Senior High Building (701 Parker Ave.) that was constructed in 1967 and subsequently remodeled in 2010 to accommodate the K - 5 students, the last students to occupy the old building at 301 Greenland Road.

In a career that lasted from 1871 to 1873 he ran twenty-five times and won nineteen races. He was one of the leading British two-year-olds of 1870, when he won nine of his eleven starts. In the summer of 1872 he became the second of six horses to win both The Derby and the Grand Prix de Paris. At the end of the 1873 season, in which he won the Ascot Gold Cup, he was retired to stud, where he was moderately successful. He died in 1881. Cremorne was regarded by contemporary authorities as one of the best horses of his era in England. Background Cremorne, described by The Field as \\"low, lengthy... wiry and muscular\\" horse with a strong and smooth action, was bred by his owner, Henry Savile at Rufford Abbey in Nottinghamshire. He was sired by Parmesan, a male-line descendant of the Byerley Turk. Parmesan won the Gold Vase at Royal Ascot and became a highly successful stallion siring, in addition to Cremorne, the 1871 Derby winner Favonius. Cremorne's dam, Rigolboche, was unraced. Savile sent the colt to his private trainer, William Gilbert at the Nunnery stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Cremorne was a difficult horse to train, owing to his extreme laziness: he was known to fall asleep during breaks in exercise. He also had an apparently insatiable appetite and would eat anything edible within his range. On one occasion he contracted a near-fatal bout of colic after eating all of his bedding straw. Racing career 1871: two-year-old season Cremorne was one of the leading colts of his generation as a two- year-old, winning nine times. His wins included the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom, the Hurstbourne Stakes at Stockbridge, two races at Ascot (one of which was a \\"walk over\\" as no horse opposed him), the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket and the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster. By August he was being described as the \\"crack two-year-old of the season\\". He was beaten twice. At York he won the North of England Biennial Stakes but was beaten in a Prince of Wales's Stakes when attempting to win a second race later the same day. Following his attack of colic in autumn, he finished third to Prince Charlie in the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket in October, although he won a Two-Year-Old Plate at the same meeting. At the end of the season, Cremorne was joint-favourite with Laburnum for the following year's Derby. 1872: three-year-old season Henry Savile, who owned and bred Cremorne Cremorne made his first appearance of the season in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 1 May. He finished second of the fourteen runners behind Prince Charlie. Two weeks later he walked over in the Newmarket Stakes. At Epsom on 29 May, Cremorne started 3/1 second favourite for the Derby behind Prince Charlie (5/2) in a field of twenty-three runners. The race was run in brilliant weather and attracted an unusually large crowd. Ridden by Charles Maidment, Cremorne tracked the leaders before being moved up to third place and then challenging for the lead just before the final turn. Entering the straight, Maidment sent the colt to the front from the early leader Westland as Prince Charlie, having briefly looked a danger, dropped away beaten. Cremorne went clear, but a challenger emerged in the form of an unnamed colt known as \\"the brother to Flurry\\" (later named Pell Mell), and the two colts raced together throughout the closing stages, with Cremorne prevailing by a head. Immediately after the Derby, Cremorne was sent to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. The 3000m race on 9 June carried a prize of ¬£6,000, making it the most valuable in France and the subject of intense nationalistic rivalry. Cremorne took the lead at the start of the straight and won easily from The Oaks winner Reine, with the Prix du Jockey Club winner Revigny only fifth. Cremorne's win provoked a hostile reaction among the spectators and he was hurried out of the country at the earliest available opportunity. Henry Savile marked the win by donating 5000 francs to \\"the poor of Paris\\". On his return to England Cremorne was sent straight to Ascot for the Royal meeting. He was entered in two races on the opening day of the meeting and won both, taking a Biennial Stakes and walking over in the Triennial Stakes. In August, Cremorne was sent to York where he won the Great Yorkshire Stakes and walked over in the North of England Biennial Stakes. Cremorne had never been entered in the St Leger and in autumn he was sent to Newmarket. He won the Newmarket Derby but was beaten in the Newmarket St Leger when attempting to give fourteen pounds to Laburnum. Cremorne's earnings of ¬£7,650 (not including the Grand Prix) were the highest for any British-trained horse that season and helped his sire Parmesan to third place in the list of leading sires 1873: four-year-old season On his four-year-old debut Cremorne finished second in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom in April, when he carried top weight of 128 pounds. In June Cremorne returned to Royal Ascot where he walked over in the Triennial Stakes before running in the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup. Opposed by a strong field, Cremorne took the lead half a mile from the finish and drew away to win easily by eight lengths from Flageolet, with Revigny and the Fillies' Triple Crown winner Hannah among those further back. Later in the meeting he won the Alexandra Plate over three miles by fifteen lengths. Soon after his runs at Ascot, Cremorne \\"sprang a curb\\" (became lame owing to a swollen hock). He was nevertheless entered in the Goodwood Cup in July, where he cantered round well behind the other two runners and walked over the line to finish tailed off in third place. He \\"ran\\" in the race purely to win a bet with a bookmaker who had offered long odds against him completing the course. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Cremorne was ranked eleventh, having been placed in the top ten by thirty of the contributors. He was the highest-placed Derby winner of the 1870s and the second highest British horse of his decade behind Isonomy. Stud career Cremorne was retired to his owner's stud. When Henry Savile died, the horse was put up for sale and bought for ¬£5,400 guineas by A. S. Lumley, a member of Savile's family. Cremorne's best progeny were the Grand Prix de Paris winner Thurio and the filly Kermesse, who was the leading British two-year-old of 1880. Without regular exercise and allowed to indulge his appetite for food, Cremorne became grossly overweight and died of \\"rupture of the heart\\" in January 1883. He was buried at Rufford Abbey, where his gravestone can still be seen.

This was the first major attack following U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.  Attacks  Iraqi officials reported at least 14 bombs went off in the capital, targeting a total of 11 neighborhoods. The Iraqi health ministry estimated 69 deaths and at least 169 wounded. The majority of attacks occurred in Shiite areas, with the exception of an IED attack in the Sunni enclave of Adhamiyah. The worst attack, the only confirmed suicide bombing, took place in the Karrada district where a bomber drove an ambulance into a government anti-corruption office, killing 25 and injuring 62. Local policemen who were standing guard let the ambulance driver through because of the vehicle and his assurances that he was trying to reach a nearby hospital. The attacks were the first assault on the capital after the beginning of an apparent sectarian crisis in the government, with prime minister Nouri al- Maliki issuing an arrest warrant for vice president Tariq Al-Hashimi just days before the incidents. Journalists on the ground reported that security forces were blocking access to bombing siteshttps://twitter.com/arwaCNN/status/149780224287051776 and that the usually packed Baghdad streets were almost deserted in the aftermath of the bombings.https://twitter.com/JomanaCNN/status/149780285158989825 In addition to the attacks in the capital, several other attacks took place around the country, including gunmen killing a family of five and a local bodyguard in the city of Baqubah. Two of the family members were members of a Sunni Awakening council. Several shootings took place in the city of Mosul, leaving two dead and four injured. Other attacks left five people injured in Musayyib and Jurf Al-Sakhar south of the capital, and a body was found in Kirkuk. Later in the evening several explosions rocked Baghdad once more. Local journalists reported at least 4 more blasts happening around 10 o'clock local time.https://twitter.com/mtawfeeqCNN/status/149923919418245120 The official death toll was raised to 72 after these further bombings, which included attacks in the Al-Shurtta and Al-Jihad districts in southwestern Baghdad.  Investigations   Speculations  There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombings. However, reports suggested the participation of al Qaeda's Sunni insurgents, as the attack mostly appeared to hit Shiite neighborhoods. Vice-President al-Hashimi, while in hiding in Iraqi Kurdistan, accused elements in the Iraqi government of orchestrating the attacks. The Islamic State of Iraq, al Qaeda's political front, claimed the 22 Dec. Baghdad bombings in a statement released on jihadist Internet forums. The statement was translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. The claim was made on 26 December 2011; the day after another suicide attack killed seven policemen outside the Interior Ministry.  Claim of liability  The Islamic State of Iraq said the attacks were the latest in what they described as a \\"series of special invasions ... to support the weak Sunnis in the prisons of the apostates and to retaliate for the captives who were executed by the Safavid [Persian or Iranian] government.\\" The term \\"Safavid government\\" refers to the government of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, a Shia politician who is accused by the Islamic State of Iraq of being under Iran's sphere of influence. Maliki has cracked down on Sunni politicians, and immediately after the US withdrawal of its troops this month, issued an arrest warrant for Vice President Tariq Hashemi. The move plunged Iraq into political crisis. Islamic State of Iraq said the targets in the 22 Dec. attack in Baghdad had been \\"accurately surveyed and explored,\\" and the \\"operations were distributed between targeting security headquarters, military patrols and gatherings of the filthy ones of the al-Dajjal Army [Shia warlord Muqtada al Sadr's Mahdi Army].\\" The terror group said it \\"knows where and when to strike, and the mujahideen will never stand with their hands tied while the pernicious Iranian project showed its ugly face and what it wants with Sunnis in Iraq became obvious and exposed.\\" The Islamic State of Iraq briefly described the suicide attack that targeted a security headquarters in Karrada in Baghdad, and said that details of the other attacks that day would be \\"published later on.\\"  Reaction  Ayad Allawi, leader of Iraqiya party, blamed the government for the violence. Allawi warned that \\"violence would continue as long as people are left out of the political process.\\" U.S military officials have expressed concern about the \\"resurgence of al-Qaeda\\" as the American military left the country.

Founded in 1971, RSOM is consistently ranked the top public medical school in New York according to US News and World Report. RSOM is one of the five Health Sciences schools under the Stony Brook Medicine healthcare system. RSOM conducts $90 million in funded medical research annually, with NIH awards to RSOM faculty and research centers exceeding $42 million. Stony Brook University Hospital, RSOM's main clinical training site, is ranked the No. 10 best hospital in New York State. History In 1963, Governor Nelson Rockefeller commissioned the report ‚ÄúEducation of Health Professions,‚Äù also known as the Muir Report. This document recommended the creation of a Health Sciences Center and an academic hospital to serve the need of the fastest growing counties in New York at the time, Nassau and Suffolk. In response to the Muir Report, an objective was set to build an academic medical center to lure established doctors to Long Island and to train new physicians. In 1965, the planning for the new medical center began under the leadership of Dr. Edmund D. Pellegrino. In 1968, Pellegrino and Dr. Alfred Knudson, the school's first appointed Professor of Medicine, presented a vision for a \\"revolutionary approach\\" towards medical education, including a compressed three year clinical training period, early direct patient contact, and encouragement of specialization. The Stony Brook University School of Medicine opened on August 10, 1971. Pellegrino was appointed the first Dean of Medicine. The inaugural class of 17 medical doctors graduated in 1974. During the early years of the School of Medicine, the Northport Veteran Affairs Medical Center was used as the primary clinical site. Clinical training was shifted over to Stony Brook University Hospital after it opened in 1980. The School of Medicine expanded rapidly in the ensuing years to encompass an educational consortium of hospitals, including the Northport VA Medical Center, Nassau County Medical Center, Long Island Jewish Hospital, Queens Hospital, and Nassau Hospital, and establishing the Department of Surgery under Harry S. Soroff and Clarence Dennis. Starting in 2013, the RSOM campus underwent a $423 million expansion project. In November 2018, the Medical and Research Translation (MART) building, an eight-story research center, opened with medical education/classroom spaces and the Stony Brook Cancer Center. The expansion project was completed the following year with the opening of the Stony Brook Children's Hospital and a new 150 bed Hospital Pavilion. Stony Brook University School of Medicine was renamed the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University in 2018. This was done to acknowledge over $500 million in donations from employees of Renaissance Technologies ‚Äî a hedge fund located 2 miles from the Stony Brook University ‚Äîwith $150 million being pledged by Jim and Marilyn Simons, and the Simons Foundation. The name change acknowledges not only the namesake of Simons' hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, but also the \\"renaissance\\" in biomedical research and innovation that the donations have fueled. The donations have helped create 9 academic and research centers, endowed 34 chairs and professorships, and funded $35 million in scholarships and fellowships. During the 2019‚Äî2020 academic year, RSOM moved to online instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After an executive order was signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo allowing for early graduation among senior medical students, 122 students from the class of 2020 graduated 2 months early, 63 of whom were deployed to the front lines of the pandemic within weeks. About RSOM consists of 8 basic science and 18 clinical departments. RSOM is involved in the preclinical and clinical education of students in the five Health Sciences schools, the students of public health, and students across other schools in the University. RSOM provides graduate, post-graduate and continuing education degrees.http://www.stonybrookmedicalcenter.org/som/admissions#uhmc RSOM offers dual degrees in conjunction with other schools at Stony Brook University. Applicants may apply to the NIH funded MD-PhD Medical Scientist Training Program. Additionally, various dual degrees options may be pursued including an MD-MPH in conjunction with the School of Public Health, an MD-MBA in conjunction with the College of Business, and an MD-MA in conjunction with the Center for Bioethics, Compassionate Care and Medical Humanities. MagicAid, a non-profit organization, was founded by medical students at the school in 2016.  Curriculum  RSOM has recently redesigned its curriculum, which has been renamed the LEARN (Learning, Experiential, Adaptive, Rigorous, and Novel) Curriculum. The curriculum is composed of three phases: (Foundational) Phase I, (Primary Clinical) Phase II, and (Advanced Clinical) Phase III. Phase I, which takes place over 18 months, begins with the 24 week \\"B3\\" course, which concerns anatomy, the molecular foundations of medicine, and mechanisms of disease. The following 36 weeks are a sequence of five integrated pathophysiology systems-based courses. Phase II, which is 12 months, marks the start of clinical clerkships, including pediatrics and ob-gyn, surgery, anesthesia and emergency medicine; and psychiatry, neurology and radiology. Finally, Phase III, totaling 16 months, includes a combination of sub- internships in medicine, pediatrics, surgery, emergency medicine, ob/gyn, or urology, advanced clinical experiences, transition to residency courses, selectives, and electives. Students are given a 10-week period between phases II and III to study and sit for the USMLE Step 1 Exam. In addition to the LEARN Curriculum, RSOM offers a Scholarly Concentrations Program, which allows students to explore one of four academic concentrations, including Basic, Translational, Clinical and Social Sciences Research, Global Health, Medical Education, and Medical Humanities and Ethics. Accepted students who are already certain of the medical speciality they would like to pursue are invited to apply to the 3-Year MD (3YMD@RSOM) Program. Depending on the specialty, between zero and two students from each incoming class are accepted to each specialty. The program saves students a year of schooling, as the curriculum is reduced from 149 weeks to 135 weeks. Students accepted into this program are given conditional acceptance to a RSOM residency program of their choice. RSOM also offers dual degree programs in affiliation with other Stony Brook University graduate schools and outside research institutions. Among them are the MD/MBA program in conjunction with the College of Business at Stony Brook University and the MD/PhD program in conjunction with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Affiliated teaching hospitals and research institutes  Stony Brook University Hospital is RSOM's primary teaching hospital Residents and fellows of RSOM train at 6 sites on Long Island: # Stony Brook University Hospital # Nassau University Medical Center # Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center # Stony Brook Southampton Hospital # Mount Sinai South Nassau # Eastern Long Island Hospital Additionally, RSOM offers its students international rotations for residents in the Departments of Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Anesthesiology and Emergency Medicine at various partner sites, including Chile, China, Ecuador, Japan, Madagascar, Peru, Rwanda and Uganda. In 2016, RSOM entered into a strategic partnership with the Mount Sinai Health System and the Icahn School of Medicine in Manhattan. This was done to increase collaboration in medical education, biomedical research, and delivery of care. Research RSOM ranks in the top 10 U.S. medical schools for NIH research funding in several disciplines, including anesthesiology and biomedical engineering.

The son of Sir Roland Penrose and Lee Miller, Penrose is director of the Lee Miller Archive and Penrose Collection at his parents' former home, Farley Farm House. Early life and family Antony Penrose was born on 9 September 1947 in the London Clinic, central London. He is the son of Lee Miller, a model, fine art photographer and noted war correspondent, and Sir Roland Penrose, the surrealist artist, poet and biographer of Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir√≥, Man Ray, and Antoni T√†pies, who co-founded the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in 1947. His grandfather was Irish painter James Doyle Penrose, and his grandmother was the daughter of the philanthropist Lord Peckover. His uncle was polymath Lionel Penrose, whose children include mathematician Oliver Penrose, polymath Sir Roger Penrose, chess grandmaster Jonathan Penrose, and geneticist Shirley Hodgson. He first lived at 11 Downshire Hill in Hampstead north London, but in 1949 his parents bought Farley Farm House, a farmhouse in the village of Chiddingly, East Sussex. His mother suffered from depression during Penrose's childhood, so he was raised by a nanny, Patsy Murray, from a young age. \\"She was a hopeless mum. She had no natural maternal instincts,\\" Penrose has said. He suffered from dyslexia, but nevertheless went on to attend the Royal Agricultural College. Career Penrose's mother was his first mentor and main inspiration. The first camera he used was a Kodak with a 120 roll film, which produced 2 1/4-inch square negatives. At 14, whilst on a family visit, Penrose took some of his first amateur photographs of Picasso. In 1962, he and his mother went on a photography trip to Zimbabwe - but Miller fell ill and so left it to Antony to take the pictures which she could not using her Zeiss Contax. She told him \\"If you drop the camera I will break your neck\\". In the late 1960s Penrose took pictures of famous artists including Picasso, Joan Mir√≥ and Man Ray. Penrose's first career move was in agriculture, which he interrupted to spend several years on a round-the-world trip in a Land Rover with his friends Robert Braden and Peter Comrie, cousin Dominic Penrose, and his late wife Suzanna. During this period he took many photos for Farmers Weekly magazine. Later on, Penrose was introduced to film-making, working on films such as Kings Horses and Migrate to Survive. He established Penrose Film Productions Ltd which primarily focuses on documentaries, technical films and drama shorts. Following the death of his mother, a cache of her work was discovered in the attic of the family home by Penrose's late wife Suzanna. It contained some 60,000 negatives, prints and manuscripts, out of which he and Suzanna created the Lee Miller Archives. Penrose has since written numerous books, articles and two plays on the subject of his parents and their associates. He is most notable for his 1985 book, The Lives of Lee Miller. The discovery of Miller's work is said to have given Penrose a new perspective on his mother, who struggled with alcoholism and depression when she was alive. \\"She was a useless drunk... most of the time she was demanding and feckless and throwing dramas at every possible thing\\", he once commented. Penrose now gives lectures worldwide on photography, fine art and his parents' work to museums and photographic societies and is accredited by the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies. He is a director of the Farley Arts Trust, a registered charity, which he founded to promote arts education in schools. The trust holds the annual Farleys Yard Arts Award for GCSE and A-level work from several local comprehensive schools. Publications Books *The Lives of Lee Miller.

It is one of two gins made on Islay, and is distinctive for its 22 hand-foraged Islay botanicals that are added to nine core gin aromatics. The botanicals are sustainably collected from all over Islay between March and October by a professional forager. The name was inspired by the two local botanists who helped develop the recipe for the gin alongside former Master Distiller Jim McEwan. Distillation The gin is distilled after an overnight maceration of the nine base botanicals ‚Äì the seed, berry, bark, root and peel categories ‚Äì in 100% wheat spirit and Islay spring water. This alcohol vapour infusion from the distillation then passes through the botanical basket containing the 22 more delicate Islay aromatic leaves and petals. This double infusion gives the Botanist gin its distinctive flavour, allowing the more delicate aromatic leaves and petals to influence the gin vapour without being destroyed. The Botanist is slow distilled in ‚ÄúUgly Betty‚Äù, a Lomond Still, one of the last in existence. The distillation takes seventeen hours, four times longer than an average whisky distillation. Distilling takes place at 0.2 atmospheres of pressure.The Botanist distillation Ugly Betty Tom Morton described Ugly Betty in his book Spirit of Adventure as \\"An oversized, upside-down dustbin made of copper\\".Trip Advisor, Bruichladdich; retrieved: 05-09-2018. (with a photo of Ugly Betty) Developed after World War II, the Lomond still was an experimental cross between a column and a pot still designed to meet the growing demand for single malt whiskies. It was designed as a \\"one-stop-shop\\" still by chemical engineer Alistair Cunningham and draftsman Arthur Warren in 1955 as a way to create a variety of whisky styles. Ingredients Two types of juniper are included, including prostrate juniper (Juniperus communis subspecies) that grows in the exposed sea level habitats of the Rhinns of Islay. Only a symbolic amount of Juniperus communis is added. The Islay spring water from which this gin is made comes from \\"Dirty Dottie‚Äôs spring\\" on Octomore farm, both for the distillation and the bottling at 46% . This artisanal dry gin is influenced exclusively by botanicals ‚Äì no essences, oils or flavourings are added. The use of such aromatic plants for flavouring spirit is not new. Islay‚Äôs distillers have a long tradition of using whatever was at hand to improve their rustically produced usquebaugh, distilled on small, portable stills, hidden away in remote glens.

The teenage non-commissioned officer was a rarity among aces. While most were commissioned officers and fighter pilots, he was an observer and gunner aboard a bomber. Nonetheless, his accuracy with a machine gun and his doughtiness led to his being awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal when he was only 18 years old. Early life Grant was born in Argyll, Scotland, in 1899. He was living in Sandbank, Argyll and Bute when he enlisted into military service. World War I heroism James Grant had gained the rank of Sergeant Mechanic with No. 57 Squadron RAF when he flew as an observer/gunner from March to September 1918 in the squadron's Airco DH.4 light bombers. The squadron was stationed at Le Quesnoy, France at that time, and was tasked with photo reconnaissance sorties and bombing missions. It was dangerous work, with a high casualty rate. On 10 June 1918, Grant began the valourous actions that brought him recognition in Royal Air Force communiqu√©s. While being piloted by Lieutenant C. W. Peckham on a bombing raid to Bapaume, France, they were attacked by eight German Fokkers. At 2010 hours, between Gr√©villers and Vimy, Grant shot down an attacking Triplane in flames. Fifteen minutes later, he destroyed another Dreidecker. Nine days later, at 1930 hours, Sergeant Grant was being flown over Bapaume by Lieutenant J. T. Kirkham when a Pfalz D.III attacked. Grant and another air crew made up of Lieutenant Claud Stokes and Corporal J. H. Bowler caught the German fighter in a crossfire; it fell out of control. On 14 August, while flying as a gunner with Lieutenant E. M. Coles, Grant shot down a Fokker D.VII that was on their tail. The British bomber was returning from a raid. Although the pursuit plane was destroyed over Roisel, in an early use of a parachute, the German pilot bailed out. On 1 September 1918, 57 Squadron was out on another bombing mission with Lieutenant Cole when they were attacked by a score of German fighters. Grant destroyed another Fokker D.VII over Cambrai, France at 1400 hours. Grant was now an ace, having scored five victories for three different pilots. Three days later, while manning the guns for Captain Andrew MacGregor, the shooting sergeant sent another Fokker D.VII down out of control into Bourlon Woods at 10 in the morning. The next day, Grant was still teamed with MacGregor. They flew two missions that day. At 1125 hours, west of Marcoing, France, Grant destroyed his third Fokker D.VII. At 1605, he destroyed his fourth D.VII west of Avesnes-le-Sec. One of that day's vanquished Fokkers burst into fire; the pilot leaped out. No parachute was spotted. Evidently, the German aviator preferred death by fall rather than by flame. Post World War I Grant's courage and marksmanship earned him a well-deserved Distinguished Flying Medal. Although the award date is unknown, it was gazetted in the London Gazette of 29 November 1918. As the citation read: :100425 Sergt.-Mech. James Grant ::A gallant and capable non-commissioned officer who has accounted for six enemy aeroplanes. On 1 September, whilst on a bomb raid his formation was attacked by fifteen Fokker biplanes and five triplanes. In the severe fighting that ensued Sergt. Grant served his gun with exceptional skill, crashing one enemy machine, and it was largely due to his good shooting that the enemy were eventually driven off. On 30 April 1991, Grant's Distinguished Flying Medal went on the auction block at Christie's. It sold as Lot 216, Sale 4517. The price was ¬£770 sterling.

The Directive provides common broad objectives for safety regulations, so that electrical equipment approved by any EU member country will be acceptable for use in all other EU countries. The Low Voltage Directive does not supply any specific technical standards that must be met, instead relying on IEC technical standards to guide designers to produce safe products. Products that conform to the general principles of the Low Voltage Directive and the relevant particular safety standards are marked with the CE marking to indicate compliance and acceptance throughout the EU. Conformance is asserted by the manufacturer based on its conformity assessment. The new version of Low Voltage Directive version of 2014/35/EU, dated 26 February 2014 and is applicable from 20 April 2016. The new version aligns with the New Legislative Framework of the European Union, though actual technical requirements do not differ much from the older version. But the legal and general requirements have changed significantly (obligations of manufacturers, dealers, marketers) and penalties are called for in the event of infringements of the directive. They must be determined by the respective Member States and should be (literally) effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Application The directive covers electrical equipment designed for use with a voltage rating of between 50 and 1000 volts for alternating current (AC) or between 75 and 1500 volts for direct current (DC). Importantly, it does not cover voltages within equipment The directive does not cover components (broadly, this refers to individual electronic components).

The 1951 Prof. Allen Hardy, arrived from Canada in Sri Lanka as the UN/FAP Advisor to the Department of Agriculture. He worked at the Maha Illuppalama Agricultural Centre and later was appointed to direct a training programme and to set up The TTI with \\"Honesty-Training-Industry\\" as its motto. Courses for the first batch of students commenced on 14 January 1956. The institute conducted two- years Diploma Courses in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Agriculture Engineering. The United Kingdom and Canada classified the TTI as a Regional Technical Training Institute (RTTI) for South East Asian Countries under the Colombo Plan. From 15 January 1956 to the time of his death on 4 December 1963 (while serving TTI), Prof. Allen Hardy served in the TTI not only to make engineers of men who had no mechanical experience but also to get them to assume their responsibility ‚Äòon-the-job‚Äô. As a tribute him, TTI was renamed Hardy Technical Training Institute (HTTI) after his death. In 1967, the institute was handed over to the Technical Education Unite of the Ministry of Education and subsequently, renamed the Hardy Senior Technical Institute (HSTI). In 1976, the National Diploma in Technology (NDT) engineering second-year courses were transferred from HSTI to Katubedda which later became a separate unit under the University of Moratuwa.

The concept of the junior college is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The government of Ceylon established the six junior university colleges in 1969. Part xvi of the Higher Education Act No. 20 of 1966 http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/hea20o1966199/s89.html provides for the establishment of Junior University Colleges in Ceylon. These are two-year colleges providing courses with a practical bias designed to meet the manpower requirements of the developing nation. The primary aim of the Junior College is the further democratization of education by extending it to beyond the secondary level.Kintzer, Frederick C. \\"Planning for the Future: A First Term Evaluation of Ceylon's Junior University Colleges.\\" Newsletter of the US Educational Foundation 6.11 (1969). The Junior University Colleges give the higher educational opportunity to many high potential students who were barred from admission to the university system.

Courses Advanced Technology Institute conducts 12 courses:  Higher National Diploma in Accountancy  The Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) program is the first professional accounting course introduced in Sri Lanka. It was started in 1943 as the National Diploma in Accountancy with the aim of detecting and preventing frauds, errors, and malpractices in Ceylon Tea Estates and Ceylon Railway. Then, it was converted to a Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) in 1946. The Ceylon Technical College at Maradana was set up by the colonial government in 1893, accounting education was not given a place in its programs for another fifty years. Only after 1942 did the Ceylon Technical College take steps to organise and offer certificate and diploma courses in accounting. Accordingly, a commercial certificate course for bookkeepers and a diploma course for prospective accountants were launched by the Technical College in 1943 and 1946 respectively. These courses were modeled on similar programs of studies offered in the U.K. Since the Diploma in Accountancy was a four-year evening course offered at the professional level the admission to the course was restricted to those who were engaged in accounting related activities. The curriculum of this course was quite similar to those of the leading professional accounting bodies in the U.K.Wijewardena, Hema, and Senarath Yapa. \\"Colonialism and accounting education in developing countries: The experiences of Singapore and Sri Lanka.\\" The International Journal of Accounting 33.2 (1998): 269-281.

Bhagyaraj. The film was remade in Kannada as Thooguve Krishnana, with Ananth Nag (1994).Bhanupriya won Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize and Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in this film. Plot Babu (K. Bhagyaraj) is a care-taker in a mental hospital who shows much devotion to his job and more affection towards the patients in the hospital. He wears the patients' dress and moves like one among them. Due to this, the chief doctor, also a priest Father, likes him much more than others, fetching Babu the enmity of two compounders in the hospital. One of the financial donors of the hospital brings a wandering girl (Bhanupriya) to the hospital, suspecting that she is mentally ill. Since nobody knows anything about her and she is mentally challenged, the hospital admits her. Babu moves with the girl like he moves with all other patients, but shows more affection than others as she does not have anybody to take care of her. The employees watch with curiosity and spin stories on them. Babu names the girl Meenakshi and calls her Meenu. One of the two compounders talks to a mentally challenged girl (Kokila Gobinathan) who is always craving for a baby, and tells her that he will give her a baby, indirectly trying to rape her. Meenu sees this and makes snake alert to stop it, which fetches everybody. This angers the compounder and he gives electric shock. Babu rescues Meenu and complains to Father, resulting in the suspension of the compounder and his friend. Babu now takes more care of her and spends more time with her. When Meenu was about to be sent off from the hospital she faints and doctors confirm her pregnancy. Everybody points out Babu as the reason, the Father also believes them and compels Babu to marry her. Babu admits he is the reason for her pregnancy and marries her. Babu's mother is very much angered by this and she shouts that her son is surely not of such a character and everybody has cheated her son. One day Father sees Meenu kneeling down near the confession box and sits to listen to her. Meenu reveals that she is not a mental patient and Babu is not the reason for her pregnancy. Meenu was a very rich orphan. She had a cousin who is of very bad character with all sorts of bad habits. He insists Meenu to marry him by pretending that he loves her more than his life. The aunt plots a plan to marry off her son to Meenu so that her property shall be inherited by her son, but Meenu refuses his proposal. She mixes sleeping pills in Meenu's milk and Meenu goes into a deep sleep. As per the plan, Meenu is raped by her cousin. When she awakes without clothes and knows the truth, she kills her aunt and escapes from her home and her cousin. She kept quiet when Babu was blamed, because she wanted to escape from her cousin by marrying a gentle man like Babu. Father is shocked to hear this and rushes to reveal the truth to everyone. But Meenu stops him that it is unethical as per Christian norms to reveal the truth heard in the confession box, which is supposed to be confidential. She also implies as per the will, all her property belongs to her child and after her child is born, she would hand over the will and child to Babu and go away from him. Father understands the meaning of the decision and tries to stop her in all means. Meenu continues to act as a mental case to everyone. Babu's mother takes Meenu with her and lives in the staff quarters house of Babu inside the hospital. Meanwhile, Meenu's cousin succeeds in his search for Meenu and he comes to meet her, but Meenu hides from him. Finally Meenu is admitted in the hospital for the childbirth. She reveals the truth to Babu as she fears she might not return after the caesarian. Menu gives birth to a boy safely. Her cousin chases her to take Meenu and his child along with him and reveals that he is the father of the child and Meenu is an accused for a murder to Babu's mother. But Meenu explains the evil thing which he did for Meenu to her mother-in-law. This makes Babu's mother understand Meenu's position and she supports her. Meenu's cousin deliberately takes Meenu and the child with him and Babu stops him. Babu explains that he cannot claim the child as his, as Meenu will be against him and also Meenu cannot be accused for murder since he himself closed the file as an accident. After a lot of struggle, the cousin is shot to dead by one of the mental patients. Meenu unites with Babu and his mother along with her child. They move back to Meenu's own place to a life of riches.

Such leadership aims to cultivate entrepreneurial individuals and teams that fully leverage their creative potential in creating value for an organisation.Compare: Entrepreneurial leadership does this by employing leadership practices that \\"develop the ability in employees to self-generate, self-reflect, and self- correct in their workplace\\". Entrepreneurial leadership is effectively using the skills associated with successful individual entrepreneurs and applying those within the environment of a larger organisation. This especially means within an organisation where those skills have been lost and replaced with a \\"corporate\\" mindset that focuses on process, systems and risk minimisation rather than on entrepreneurial behaviour. Compare: Definitions and theories Other definitions of entrepreneurial leadership have also emerged: An entrepreneurial leader will proactively identify opportunities to gain advantage through creativity, innovation and market understanding and then hoion and the customer. j Attributes of an entrepreneurial leader The entrepreneurial leader will work within a formalised organisational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an entrepreneur to identify opportunities. Once an opportunity has been identified, they work towards creating a value proposition which will enable a rapid testing of their key assumptions. Next to an effective management of risk (rather than the minimisation of risk often sought within corporate environments), they are required to operate with contextual awareness in order to create a value proposition that delivers value to the customer while taking into account the organisational requirements and strategic aims. The entrepreneurial leader must have the ability to learn fast and within environments of ambiguity and change, while providing clarity and coherence for those around them.http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/crosscuttings/leadership_entrepreneurial.htmlhttp://www.legacee.com/Info/Leadership/LeadershipEntrepreneurial.html The entrepreneurial leader takes responsibility for their actions and those actions must be more proactive than reactive. They think about achieving organisational outcomes in an innovative way and working with a diverse group of people and resources to achieve these goals.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=347https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACf6aSDfbchttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcaMjhsWtI Notable examples Perhaps the best known and most widely considered example of an entrepreneurial leader is Steve Jobs, but there are many real life examples in the world of business and other industries, such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Jack Ma and Richard Branson. History The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has been ongoing for centuries. History's greatest philosophical writings from Plato's Republic to Plutarch's Lives have explored the question \\"What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?\\". Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the \\"trait theory of leadership\\". The concept of entrepreneurial leadership was introduced in 2000 by McGrath and MacMillan who suggested that in dynamic markets where there is increased uncertainty and competitive pressure a new type of leader is required. They described this as the \\"entrepreneurial leader\\". These fast changing markets or situations give those with an \\"entrepreneurial\\" approach the ability to exploit opportunities to gain advantage for their organisation faster than others.McGrath, R. G. & MacMillan, I. C. 2000. The entrepreneurial mindset : strategies for continuously creating opportunity in an age of uncertainty. Boston, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press. A number of organisations have sought to develop the concept of entrepreneurial leadership within the business world. A good example is UBS, the global bank, which in the period 2002 to 2006 proactively developed entrepreneurial leadership amongst its top 500 leaders. The success of this was demonstrated by improvements in individual, team and financial performance, the project becoming a key element in the Harvard Business School Case study, \\"UBS Aligning the Integrated firm\\". The bank was subsequently awarded the title Best Company for Leaders (Europe) 2005. The implementation of this project over a multi divisional bank spread globally was complex and took a number of years. This is reviewed in a case study by Chris Roebuck, Visiting Professor of Transformational Leadership at Cass Business School in London. Roebuck was one of the leaders of the team who implemented entrepreneurial leadership in UBS. The principles of entrepreneurial leadership can be applied to a number of sectors and to a wide variety of organisations. The success of this approach has confirmed the compatibility of entrepreneurial leadership to the majority of organisations seeking to improve client/customer service and overall performance. Prof Chris Roebuck notes that in recent examples of applying entrepreneurial leadership to organisations, the link to employee engagement has increasingly become as a key success factor. This has also allowed development of the concept of entrepreneurial support functions, such as Entrepreneurial HR and Entrepreneurial IT, to support the customer or client facing parts of organisations.http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/08/Different-Slant-Chris- roebuck-1.pdf Entrepreneurial Leadership is not so much a style of leadership as a focus of leadership and employees' efforts on specific actions that either maximise the effectiveness of service delivery currently or seek to improve it in the future. Styles of leadership Leadership style refers to a leader's behavior. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership (Robert Hariman, Political Style,Robert Hariman, Political Style, U of Chicago Press, 1995 Philippe-Joseph Salazar, L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La DominationPhilippe-Joseph Salazar, L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination, Paris, 2009). Participative or democratic style The democratic leadership style favors decision-making by the group. Such a leader gives instructions after consulting the group. They can win the cooperation of their group and can motivate them effectively and positively. The decisions of the democratic leader are not unilateral as with the autocrat because they arise from consultation with the group members and participation by them. Autocratic or authoritarian style Under the autocratic leadership style, all decision- making powers are centralized in the leader, as with dictators. Leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.

It was one of the series of Aldwych farces that ran nearly continuously at the Aldwych Theatre in London from 1923 to 1933. The story concerns two guests, staying at the Stoatt household for Christmas, who offer shelter to a pretty concert performer left stranded when her employer absconds, leaving his cast unpaid. The piece opened on 26 May 1931 and ran for 263 performances until 16 January 1932.\\"Aldwych Theatre\\", The Times, 27 May 1931, p. 10; and \\"Theatres\\", The Times, 5 January 1932, p. 10 A film adaptation of the play was made in 1933. Background Turkey Time was the ninth in the series of twelve Aldwych farces, and the seventh written by Travers. The first four in the series, It Pays to Advertise, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook and Thark had long runs, averaging more than 400 performances each. The next three were less outstandingly successful, the runs getting shorter with each production: Plunder (1928, 344 performances); A Cup of Kindness (1929, 291 performances); A Night Like This (1930, 267 performances). Turkey Time improved upon the eighth in the series, Marry the Girl (1930), which had managed only 195 performances. Like its predecessors, the play was directed by Tom Walls, who co-starred with Ralph Lynn, a specialist in playing \\"silly ass\\" characters. The regular company of supporting actors included Robertson Hare, who played a figure of put-upon respectability; Mary Brough in eccentric old lady roles; Ethel Coleridge as the severe voice of authority; Winifred Shotter as the sprightly young female lead; and the saturnine Gordon James.Trussler, p. 278Travers, p. vi This was the last of the Aldwych farces in which Walls appeared on stage.

Act I ;The dining room at Edwin Stoatt's house The Stoatt household comprises the meek Edwin and his bossy wife Ernestine, her sister Louise and her fianc√© David Winterton, and Max Wheeler, a cousin of Ernestine and Louise, on a holiday from his home in Canada. Ernestine insists that they should all go out carol singing, but Max cannot be found. Mrs Gather, who runs a guest house nearby, comes to complain that one of the men of the household has been misbehaving with one of her guests. Ernestine is so indignant at this slur that she sends Mrs Gather away without learning which of the three men she is accusing. Everyone except David leaves to go carol singing. Mrs Gather reappears, with Rose in tow. Mrs Gather has decided that as Rose cannot pay her bill, the man whom she saw kissing her can take care of her. The man was Max, but David does not correct Mrs Gather's error. She leaves Rose with David. Rose has been appearing in a show, and was left stranded when the manager absconded without paying his cast. They are interrupted by Warwick Westbourne, an actor who has a romantic interest in Rose and wishes to take her away. Edwin and Louise return, and in the ensuing confusion Westbourne leaves with Rose. Max returns. He and David vow to rescue Rose from Westbourne's clutches. They discover from Mrs Gather that Westbourne has taken Rose to the Bella Vista hotel and go in pursuit. Act II ;Scene 1 ‚Äì The \\"Bella Vista\\", downstairs To raise money, Westbourne proposes to sell the theatre company's costumes to Luke Meate, the simple-minded uncle of the landlady of the Bella Vista. Meate gives him the contents of the petty cash box. Mrs Gather's increasingly strident demands for the money owed to her are soon augmented by the demand of Mrs Pike, the owner of the Bella Vista, for the return of her petty cash. The carol singers are heard outside, and Max realises that he can prise enough money from Edwin's collection box to pay both women. Edwin naturally refuses, but Max and David bamboozle him into parting with it. ;Scene 2 ‚Äì The \\"Bella Vista\\", upstairs Mrs Gather, learning that the money is, as she puts it, \\"ill-got\\", refuses to accept it. Edwin takes it back. David and Max smuggle Rose out through her bedroom window, and only Edwin is still there when Ernestine and the carol singers burst in. Act III ;The dining room at Edwin Stoatt's house David is wondering how to break it to Louise that he has fallen in love with Rose. Louise gets in first, telling him that she has fallen for Max, who reciprocates her love. Florence, the maid, offers Rose the use of the spare bed in her room, and lends her a pair of pyjamas. There is a confused scene in the dark in the small hours when Ernestine brings in Christmas parcels for the household while Edwin discovers and attempts to conceal the clothes that Rose has left there. Finally, Westbourne appears and is knocked out by Max, while David and Rose drive away together in Edwin's motor-car. Critical reception Ivor Brown wrote in The Observer: The Illustrated London News said of Hare, \\"that plaintive air and furrowed brow of his rank with the Tower and the Monument as one of the sights of London\\", and thought the play \\"very good entertainment, though ‚Ä¶ some of the Rabelaisian jests will not appeal to all.\\"Illustrated London News, 25 July 1931, p. 158 The Daily Mirror thought the piece \\"will not rank with the best of the Aldwych farces but ‚Ä¶ has a lot of odds and ends of fun, plus a dash of charm.\\"\\"7th success of Ben Travers\\", The Daily Mirror, 27 May 1931, p. 2 Revivals and adaptations The play was revived at the Bristol Old Vic in December 1986, directed by Roger Rees with Robert East, Anthony Pedley and John Rogan in the Lynn, Walls and Hare roles.Billington, Michael. \\"End of the pierrot show\\", The Guardian, 12 December 1986, p. 19 In 1933 the play was turned into a film of the same title directed by and starring Walls.

Design and development The Woodwind was a homebuilt copy of the Wittman Tailwind using all-wood construction, rather than welded steel tube and aircraft fabric covering for the fuselage. Ironically, the Wittman design uses plywood covering for its wings, while the Woodwind uses fiberglass. The Woodwind is a two-seat side-by-side configuration, strut- braced, high-wing aircraft with conventional landing gear and Plexiglas doors. Some construction elements were adapted from the all-wood Bowers Fly Baby. The fuselage sides and tail surfaces are built flat on a table at the same time and covered with aircraft grade plywood. The wings are covered in fiberglass with stainless steel torque tubes for aileron control. The fuel tanks and cowling are also made from fiberglass. The prototype used a moose-hide interior.

Context  Photios of Constantinople At least five councils (in 859, 861, 867, 869-870, and 879-880) were held in Constantinople over the deposition of Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople by Emperor Michael III and his replacement by Photios. The Pope in disagreement held a synod at the Lateran in 863 that reversed the decision of the Eastern Churches and the Emperor; this was taken by the East as an unacceptable intervention by the Pope of Rome. Pope Nicholas I had attempted to remove Photios and reappoint Ignatius as the Patriarch of Constantinople by his own authority and decree. Thus, the Pope was intervening in matters of Imperial authority as well as in the other churches of the East and their own internal councils and authorities, which they understood to be outside the Pope's own jurisdiction of Rome (and perhaps the rest of the West; at the time of these councils there were no other Patriarchs in the West other than Rome, whereas there were four Patriarchs of the East). The Council at Constantinople in 867 excommunicated Pope Nicholas I and declared him anathema. In addition, Roman claims of papal primacy, his contacts with Bulgaria, and the Filioque clause were condemned.David Ford: St. Photios the Great, the Photian Council, and Relations with the Roman Church Pope Nicholas I subsequently died and was replaced by Pope Adrian II.  Aftermath  The Council of 867 was followed by another Council of Constantinople, held in 869-870, receiving papal support and abolishing the Council of 867. Several years later, new Council of Constantinople was held in 879-880, restoring the conclusions of the Council of 867. The Roman Catholic Church rejects the councils of 867 and 879-880 but accepts the council of 869-870; the reverse is true of the Eastern Orthodox churches.

Biography Liodor Palmin was born in 1841 in Yaroslavl region and became interested in literature through his father, a retired officer, himself a published poet who was close to the circle of Alexander Voeykov. It was Palmin Senior who's imbued his son with the love to the twin tradition of romantically rhetorical ode and 'rational', polite satire, prevalent at the time in the Russian poetry. Palmin's childhood impressions, concerning literature as a kind of high priesthood for an enlightened modern man, that Palmin has carried all through his life. In 1856, after his father's death, Liodor Palmin enrolled into the 3rd Saint Petersburgh gymnasium and, upon the graduation, joined the law faculty of the Saint Petersburgh University. In 1861 he got involved in students troubles, was arrested and got incarcerated into the Petropavlovskaya fortress ‚Äì this harrowing experience caused him much anguish which resulted in memoirs, The Fortress.Oskolki. No. 20, 1882. After the liberation Palmin was expelled from the University, failed to find himself a regular job (as an address expedition) and settled as a free-lance journalist. Palmin debuted in 1858 as a translator from French in A.O.Ishimova's girl magazine Lutchi (Rays). In 1860-1862 he published poems in magazines Vek (edited by Pyotr Weinberg) and Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya (edited by Aleksey Pisemsky); in the mid-1860s he was actively contributing to publications associated with the literary left (Budilnik, Delo, Zhenski Vestnik). In 1863-1868 he became friends with Vladimir Kurochkin and started to contribute regularly to Iskra magazine which he later regarded his aesthetic and ideological alma mater. All the while Palmin thought real poetry's social meaning had no bearing upon whatever political hue and particular magazine was being marked by. This made it possible for him to publish his work in the satirical journal Zanoza (Splinter), edited by Mikhail Rosenheim, and Literaturnaya Biblioteka (edited by Yuri Bogushevich). Later in the 1870s and 1880s, he was published in virtually every paper available, including tabloids like Moskovski Listok somehow without losing his political integrity of as mild and generic political satirist, ridiculing \\"circus, markets and kharchevnyas\\", maintaining sacred nature of high literature (The Sacked Temple, 1877). The 1880s saw the quick decline of Palmin: disillusioned in himself and all things around him he drank a lot and lived a life of a hermit. His death came almost unnoticed, and his name was quickly forgotten. Yet, according to N. Leikin, \\"In the memory of contemporaries he remained an exceptionally interesting, although typical figure, one of honest, innocent and sincere albeit slightly discordant bohemia of the 1860s\\".N. A. Leykin Remembered. P. 200.  Legacy Liodor Palmin professed more or less abstract democratic principles and had his political agenda described as 'amorphous', but never ceased praising 'fighting for freedom heroics' (\\"Rendes-Vous\\", 1865, \\"Eternal Lives\\", 1867) and expressed most ardent admiration for zealots and pioneers in social struggle. In his political poetry Palmin denounced halfway house results of the 1861 political reforms (\\"Common Songs\\"), deplored the general social apathy in Russia (\\"Magic Sounds of Mystery Strings\\", 1865) ridiculed liberals for their lack of principals (\\"Uncle Midnight\\", 1866). Arguably the most radical of his poems, Requiem (\\"Don't mourn dead fighters‚Ä¶\\", Iskra, No. 11, 1865) became a popular revolutionary song. Palmin's poetry, having formed under the Iskra influence which mixed Nekrasov's \\"pathos of suffering\\" with Heine-derived \\"high-brow irony\\", amounted rarely to more than stilted and repetitive commentaries on contemporary issues. All the while Palmin retained his reputation of a \\"progressive man\\" and was a popular writer, \\"one of those who were being worshiped in Taganrog,\\" according to Anton Chekhov. In 1970s Palmin was enjoying his reputation of the \\"keeper of revolutionary traditions in Russian poetry\\" and continued to fiercely attack his \\"age ‚Äì dumb, cheap and mercenary in spirit\\", along with \\"all-pervading egotism of a mob\\", the two common evils which could be withstood only by the enormous might of a Poet, as he saw it (\\"In Memory of Nekrasov\\"). Seeing poetry as a strong formative moral instrument, Palmin never shied before using ‚Äòlighter‚Äô forms, like fables, feuilletons and couplets. His \\"Mikhey and the Philanthropist\\" couplet was considered to be his most successful and well-known. Later literary scholars agreed that Palmin has never been a master of sharp political criticism, his verse, full of hints and half-spoken implementations, used spacious declarative monologues, stylistic clich√©s and borrowed a lot from mythology. Themes of personal tiredness and depression became prevalent in his 1880s work (From Winter Songs, 1882), his declarations becoming more and more repetitive and dour. All the while Palmin's popularity never waned and in Oskolki he remained the leading poet up until the 1880s. In fact, he's always remained \\"a censor's bane\\": while 300 of his works were published, 70 were banned. Checkov regarded him \\"an original, even if very monotonous\\" poet and spoke highly of him personally. \\"Palmin is a thoroughly poetic figure‚Ä¶ ever stuffed with themes and ideas... talk for 3 or 4 hours to him and you won't hear a false word, not a single banality\\", he wrote. According to Alexander Amfiteatrov, \\"Palmin had his own style of writing, his own imagery, his own temperament, what he lacked was an original concept and ideologically he's been always hanging behind his age, even if full of best intentions and all the right kinds of sensibilities.\\" References Imperial Russian poets Imperial Russian male writers Russian male poets Imperial Russian translators 1841 births 1891 deaths 19th-century translators 19th-century poets 19th-century Russian male writers ","title":"Liodor Palmin"},{"id":"34155844","text":"Nicolas Fillon (born January 14, 1986 in Suresnes, France) is a French athlete who specialises in the 400 meters.

It is popular with middle- aged and retired women who have been referred to as \\"dancing grannies\\" in the English-language media. Due to its low cost and ease of participation, it has been estimated to have over 100 million practitioners, according to CCTV, the country's official television network. The practice has roots in both ancient and modern Chinese history. Dancing for exercise has been recorded as developed millennia ago in Emperor Yao's China, and during the Song Dynasty the public spaces of cities were noted for their use in performance. Most of the women who square dance came of age during the Cultural Revolution, when folk dances such as yangge were widely performed, often as propaganda. Some have confirmed that this nostalgia is one of their reasons for taking part, although the benefits of the exercise and socialization opportunities also play a role. Square dancers dance to a variety of music, mostly Chinese popular songs, both contemporary and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into retirement began doing it to keep themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing has been the subject of considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of noise pollution in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where they could go. Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in the morning when they are trying to sleep, have sometimes reacted violently. In 2015 the Chinese government reacted to these complaints and incidents by prescribing a set of standardized routines for all dancers to follow, claiming they would be culturally unifying and healthier. The move was met with widespread criticism. Some Chinese complained that it did nothing to address the noise issues; others said the dancers should be free to choose their own routines. The real problem, yet others said, was not only the lack of better places for the dancing but the lack of other social opportunities for the women. The government soon clarified that the routines it created and promoted were only meant to be healthy alternatives to existing ones and were not required. Form The groups congregate in the early morning and evening, any time of year, at parks or public squares, or anywhere they can find enough space, regardless of what other use that space may nominally have, such as a parking lot. Morning dancers try to avoid parks since they are preferred locations for taiji, the martial arts school whose slowed-down moves are often practiced as exercise, known as tai chi in the West. They begin as early as 5:30 a.m., and tend to use spaces nearer supermarkets so they are better positioned to bargain for and purchase fresh vegetables when the markets open. In the evening they tend to start dancing after dinner; for this reason spaces used by square dancers in the evening tend not to be too far from their homes as they also may have to tend to grandchildren they may be watching while their own children work late. Older square dancers at alt=Six women, some elderly, standing in a column (except for one on the right) next to a white wall on a stone floor. All are clad in street clothes, with their left arm curled over their heads and their right arm extended. Dancers organize themselves into rank and file. The front rank comprises the most proficient dancers, the best being in the center. Each rank back from the one in front contains dancer who are less proficient. All the dancers face forward. This allows dancers to learn from those in the rows ahead. The back rank is often populated with beginners just learning the moves, while the front rows are well-coordinated. Some groups have gotten large, as many as 80 members in some cases. Leaders of these large groups charge a small fee to regular attendees to support the use of the electronics. It is reported as being either per month or ¬•20 annually. One group in Changsha, however, was said to charge twice that.Zhao, Ë¥πÁî®ÊúâÊØè‰∫∫ÊØèÂπ¥20ÂÖÉÁöÑÔºå‰πüÊúâÊØè‰∫∫ÊØèÊúà5ÂÖÉÁöÑÔºåËßÜÂêÑÈ¢ÜËàûËÄÅÂ∏àÁöÑÊÑèÊÑøËÄåÂÆöÔºå‰ΩÜÊÄª‰ΩìÊù•ËØ¥Ôºå‚ÄúË¥πÁî®ÊòØÂæàÂ∞ëÁöÑ‚Äù„ÄÇ...

Groups that form by such splits often consider themselves in competition. These can take the nature of friendly, organized events,Zhao, \\"ÊçÆÊõπÈú≤ÂêëÊó∂‰ª£Âë®Êä•ËÆ∞ËÄÖÊèèËø∞Ôºå‰∏Ä‰ΩçÊπñÂçóÂ∏àËåÉÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÁöÑÈÄÄ‰ºëÂ•≥ÊïôÂ∏àÔºåÂÖàÊòØÂèÇÂä†‰∫ÜÂ≠¶Ê†°ÈôÑËøëÁöÑ‚ÄúÂπøÂú∫Ëàû‚ÄùÂõ¢‰ΩìÔºåÁÜüÁªÉÂêéÊÑüÂà∞‚ÄúËàûËπàËäÇÂ•èÂ§™ÊÖ¢ÔºåÊõ¥Êñ∞ÁöÑÈÄüÂ∫¶‰πü‰∏çÂ§™È¢ëÁπÅ‚ÄùÔºåÈöèÂêéÂ∏¶ÁùÄÈòü‰ºçÈáåÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰∫õÊàêÂëòÈáçÊñ∞ÊàêÁ´ã‰∫ÜËá™Â∑±ÁöÑÂõ¢ÈòüÔºå‰ªéÁΩë‰∏äÁúãËßÜÈ¢ëÂ≠¶‰π†ËàûËπàÔºåÁîöËá≥Âà∞Â§ñÂú∞‚ÄúÂèñÁªè‚ÄùÔºåËá™Ê≠§‰ª•ÊØèÂë®ÊïôÂ≠¶‰∏ÄÊîØÊñ∞ËàûÁöÑÈÄüÂ∫¶ÔºåËøÖÈÄüÂ∞ÜÂéüÂÖàÁöÑÈòü‰ºçÊØî‰∫Ü‰∏ãÂéª„ÄÇ\\" or more serious competition for the best spaces available and the loudest sound. Apparel varies greatly. Many groups' members show up in street clothes or exercise clothing similar to that worn for aerobics or yoga in the West. More advanced groups sometimes wear costumes and use props. The New York Times reported seeing one group in green fatigues, dancing to songs from the Korean War era. A Beijing group attracted international attention in summer of 2014 for performing Cultural Revolution-era songs like \\"Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China\\" outside a local shopping mall every night, wearing military uniforms and using toy guns as props. The music is usually broadcast from a portable CD player and amplifier on wheels, powered by a large vehicle battery. Accompaniment varies. Some groups dance to Western pop or even waltzes, but most choose Chinese popular songs with a dance beat, such as the 2014 hit \\"Little Apple\\", or older hits from the 1950s, often with propagandist lyrics. Some dances are complicated and demanding, but the majority are low-impact routines that primarily consist of holding the dancer's arms in front of the body in varied positions. For this reason they are often referred to derisively as \\"zombie dances.\\" Perceived benefits A mixed-age group of square dancers in Beijing, June 2017 \\"It's good for my health to be able to come out and exercise,\\" a retiree told the Los Angeles Times. \\"I used to be quick to lose my temper, but now nothing bothers me,\\" a similarly aged retired paper mill worker explained to The New York Times about the effect square dancing had had on her. \\"When I dance, I forget all my cares. And I can also hike up mountains with little effort.\\" A recent survey found that Shanghai residents have more tolerance for square dancing. According to the report, 75% of residents supported the group dancing, and 73% of young residents supported it. Beyond that, most residents said they thought guangchangwu is good for health, both mental and physical - 62% saw regular dancing as exercise and recreation, and 61% believed it helps elderly people expand their social circles and dispel loneliness. History Dance as a form of exercise, has a long history in China. The L√ºshi Chunqiu, an encyclopedia compiled in the third century B.C.E., during the Spring and Autumn period, describes how, two millennia earlier in the time of Emperor Yao, people began to dance slowly in order to reinvigorate their muscles after lengthy rains had kept them indoors, sometimes leading to joint diseases. Eventually they began dressing up in costumes and using props. \\"As time passed, they discovered that some activities could promote appetite, strengthen muscles and bones, and get rid of fatigue,\\" writes one historian of Chinese traditional medicine. \\"Over a longer period of time, these activities became arranged in rhythms and movements which were harmonious and graceful‚Äînow they had dancing.\\" While these may have eventually evolved into modern breathing exercises, other commentators suggest a public aspect to such dancing analogous to modern square dancing may have been refined in later eras, such as the religious dances of the Warring States period that preceded the rise of Imperial China. A writer in Youth Times sees it as similar to public dancing in the Song Dynasty of the late first millennium C.E. The origins of modern square dancing have been traced to the Cultural Revolution that swept China during the 1960s and early '70s, in the broader context of the country's urbanization. In 1949, the Communist Party of China (CPC) won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China. A decade later, CPC chairman Mao Zedong began the Great Leap Forward economic development initiative to accelerate industrialize the Chinese economy. At the time most Chinese still lived in rural areas, as they had for centuries. Some had already moved to cities to take industrial jobs, but to better realize the aspirations of the Great Leap Forward, many of them moved or were forcibly relocated.Tong, 19‚Äì20. In cities during the Great Leap, there was an emphasis on collective use of public space even for activities that had usually taken place in the home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat their dinner in public dining halls. Ultimately, the Great Leap Forward proved disastrous, failing to industrialize effectively and causing famine due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing people to move back to farms.Tong, 15‚Äì16. Soon afterward, the Cultural Revolution began. Organized youth styling themselves the Red Guards revolted against both Chinese traditions and official Chinese communism, preferring the purity of Maoism. Since urban intellectuals' thought was believed to have been tainted by awareness or memory of capitalism, many were sent to rural areas to live, work and be properly re-educated through review of Mao's writings. This too caused great hardship and economic disruption. alt=Six women in red gowns with white trim on a wooden floor against a white background performing a dance In the rural areas they were relocated to, the urbanites first encountered the yangge folk dance, very popular in rural areas, particularly in northern China. Originally performed to mark important agricultural occasions, yangge had been adapted by the CPC for its own uses as a propaganda tool. Performances often helped relieve tensions between the party and the peasantry during times when food was scarce, although during the more repressive period of the Cultural Revolution, yangge was itself banned along with many other traditional forms of expression. The Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death in 1976. Following the arrest and trial of the Gang of Four, including Mao's widow for perpetrating it, Deng Xiaoping took over as CPC chairman and instituted a program of economic reform which continues as \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\". The pace of urbanization picked up again afterwards. As younger Chinese moved from farms to cities, found jobs and started families, their parents often moved in with them to better supervise their grandchildren. Foreign dance trends, such as ballroom, which had been suppressed during the Cultural Revolution, returned. Women who had experienced the brunt of the Cultural Revolution and its dislocations in their teens and young adulthood, including the exposure to and participation in yangge performances, began to reach mandatory retirement age in the mid-1990s, or were laid off from state-run enterprises following privatization. Some also began experiencing marital stress as husbands began having extramarital affairs with younger women, left home for long periods of time to work elsewhere, or both. They returned to dance as a way to stay fit, relieve boredom and socialize. Some dancers themselves make this historical connection. \\"When I do the dances, it reminds me of my younger years when I was doing similar dances during the Cultural Revolution,\\" a retired driver in her mid-60s told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. \\"I feel the same kind of spirit and emotions.\\" Another woman, whose troupe used the \\"red songs\\" written during that era, was more political. \\"The[y] can always remind us what the Chinese leaders did for us to have a good life today and how they fought hard for the ordinary people in China.\\" The cities they were living in, however, lacked sufficient space for such activities. Chinese urban planners had prioritized commerce and industry, often demolishing older neighborhoods with small houses and replacing them with large high-rise apartment complexes, increasing population density. Streets were widened to accommodate automobile traffic, driving many activities that had once taken place there elsewhere.Tong, 21. Although there were parks, there were severe shortages of urban open space, especially in rapidly growing cities. The small city of Xuanhua northwest of Beijing had, as of 2013, a mere of open space per resident, far below the suggested by the World Health Organization, as compared with per resident in Beijing and in New York or in Warsaw.Tong, 27‚Äì28. At first, they joined older Chinese in practicing taiji, the slow martial arts school known in the West as tai chi, and the newer practices of Falun Gong. Tai chi's philosophy strongly encourages its practice in parks, closer to nature, and space there was scarce. Falun Gong was outlawed by the government in 1999, eliminating that option for exercise. So, the women, referred to as d√†mƒÅs (), often rendered in the English press as \\"grannies\\", began finding their own spaces to dance in the way they had in their youth. The damas ranks continued to grow along with China's cities. By 2008 half of the country's population was living in an urban environment. That year they received unintentional official encouragement when the government promoted fitness all over the country in anticipation of that year's Olympics in Beijing. Conflicts and controversy In the 2010s square dancing began to draw notice both in China and abroad. A Jiangsu TV network sponsored a contest, drawing participants from seven cities. Its successful broadcast drew more participants into the squares and plazas.Zhao, \\"Ê±üËãèÂç´ËßÜÂú®ÂéªÂπ¥Êé®Âá∫‰∫ÜÂ§ßÂûãÂÖ¨ÁõäÂÅ•Ë∫´Á±ªËäÇÁõÆ„ÄäÊúÄÁÇ´Ê∞ëÊóèÈ£é„ÄãÔºåÈïúÂ§¥ÂØπÂáÜÁöÑÊòØÂÖ®ÂõΩ1.8‰∫øËÄÅ‰∫∫„ÄÇ ËØ•ËäÇÁõÆÂú®ÂÖ®ÂõΩ‰∏ÉÂ§ßÂüéÂ∏ÇËøõË°å‰∫ÜÊãõÂãüÔºåÂú®‰ºóÂ§ö‚ÄúÂπøÂú∫Ëàû‚ÄùÁæ§‰Ωì‰∏≠ÂºïËµ∑Â∑®Â§ßÂèçÂìçÔºåÂ•ñÈáëÊõ¥ÊòØÈ´òËææ‰∏äÁôæ‰∏á„ÄÇ\\" In 2014 the Chopstick Brothers featured square dancers in the video for their hit song \\"Little Apple\\"; the dancers returned the favor by making it a popular tune for their routines. However, square dancers also came into conflict with residents of the areas that surrounded their preferred spaces. Many were younger workers who complained that this noise pollution kept them or their families from getting needed rest, especially if different groups of dancers began turning their music up to compete with each other. \\"One man bouncing his infant daughter says he fears the first words she will speak are the saccharine lyrics that waft in daily through the walls and windows,\\" the BBC reported in 2013. The dancers also drew complaints that they blocked building entrances, sidewalks or parking lots. The annoyed residents have sometimes taken it upon themselves to quiet the dancers' din. In Wenzhou, one group pooled the equivalent of US$40,000 to purchase a sound system of their own, loudly reminding dancers to comply with Chinese noise pollution laws. Wuhan residents threw human excrement on dancers from the tops of their neighboring towers. In a 2013 incident that gained national attention, a man in Beijing's outlying Changping District was arrested after he fired a shotgun in the air and set his three Tibetan Mastiffs on a nearby group of dancers. Large dance in a public square Altercations have even arisen among the dancers themselves. In Qingyuan, two groups of rival dancers allegedly came to blows when they tried to share a small space at a local park. A court ordered one group to pay the other's medical costs. Dancers have also taken their dances overseas. A dance on Moscow's Red Square provided no incident, but other square dancers have not been so lucky in other countries (similarly, Russians visiting cities in Manchuria have joined in the square dances). Two mainland Chinese women visiting Taipei decided to do their dance in the hotel lobby, attracting attention from guests there and causing friction with hotel management. A group dancing in Sunset Park, home of one of the earliest Chinatowns in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, made headlines in August 2014 when its leader was arrested for violating a city ordinance forbidding sounds over 45 decibels; the charge was later dropped. Square dancers' response to clashes with residents over noise has been mixed. While one group of dancers in Xi'an's Weiyang District voluntarily agreed to limit its routines to certain times and noise levels, others have been more defiant. \\"The louder the music, the more fun it is,\\" one dancer told The New York Times in 2015. Song Jiahong, a humanities professor at Yunnan University, says this apparent insensitivity to loud noise is another effect of the Cultural Revolution, when propaganda read over loudspeakers was a constant feature of daily Chinese life. \\"The intimate memories of the loudspeakers are lodged deep in the subconscious of the old Red Guards,\\" he wrote. \\"They have no concept that this can actually annoy others.\\" But other analysts wrote that the problem went deeper than this insensitivity. Tong writes: As a remedy that his home city of Xuanhua could implement, he suggested closing off lanes of less busy streets in the neighborhoods favored by square dancers to create temporary pedestrian space. He estimated that this could provide up to per dancer in the city.Tong, 36‚Äì43. 2015 government response In March 2015, two government agencies, the State General Administration of Sports and the Ministry of Culture, announced the development of 12 model square dancing routines it had hired and trained instructors to introduce around the country. \\"Dancing in public squares represents the collective aspect of Chinese culture, but now it seems that the overenthusiasm of participants has dealt it a harmful blow with disputes over noise and venues,\\" explained Liu Guoyong, director of General Administration of Sports' public fitness department. \\"So we have to guide it with national standards and regulations.\\" Xinhua, the government's press agency, explained that the new routines would help make square dancing \\"a nationally unified, scientifically crafted new activity that brings positive energy to the people.\\" The announcement was accompanied by a video set to \\"Little Apple\\" demonstrating one of the new routines. Despite the tension between square dancers and residents of the areas they danced in, most Chinese opposed the move and supported the square dancers' right to choose their own music and dances. \\"This isn't a business,\\" one dancer told the Times. \\"Dancing is free and voluntary, so why does the government need to get involved?\\" Their disapproval was echoed in some of the country's media. \\"What the grannies need are venues, not regulated routines,\\" said RedNet, an online news portal. \\"Only an increase of public sports venues can satisfy urban and rural residents' need for fitness routines such as football and square-dancing, and lessen the phenomenon where square-dancing disturbs residents and takes up all the parks and public spaces.\\" In Shanghai, the Xinmin Evening News pointed out that \\"The biggest tragedy is not the square dance by grannies, but the fact that grannies have nothing else to do than square-dance.\\" Other commentators expressed more practical concerns, such as whether the higher-impact routines were ideal for older women. \\"Who pays the medical bills if the grannies hurt themselves doing these?\\", asked one person on a CCTV social media site. Wang Guangcheng, the fitness trainer who developed the routines, said that concern was misplaced. None of the groups of dancers he tested them on had any complaints, he said. \\"Some even asked that the moves be more complicated.\\" Shortly afterwards, officials stated that the new routines were not meant to be the only ones permitted, contrary to what the original announcement had stated. \\"We saw that some people on the Internet were worried that the new regulations meant all over China people would only be allowed to dance these twelve routines,\\" said Liu. \\"Of course that's impossible. It's a misunderstanding.\\" Many Chinese took this to be a tacit admission that the hostile reaction to the routines and the sheer number of square dancers, meant that government realized it would be impossible to displace existing square- dance routines with its own. Wang had earlier clarified that he designed the routines to provide fuller exercise than the ones he saw on the streets. His routines were designed to involve the entire body, and incorporate dance moves from styles the Chinese public was not yet widely familiar with such as salsa and the Zumba fitness routine. He hoped that the more intense routines would widen the demographic of square dancers. \\"I want to see more young people dancing in public squares.\\" See also * History of Chinese dance * List of dances * Pre-work assembly * Radio calisthenics * Social dance * Street dance References External links * Dance in China Sport in China Chinese society Articles containing video clips ","title":"Square dancing (China)"},{"id":"34155884","text":"Geri Maye is an Irish presenter on radio and television who worked predominantly on Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â).

The seal is designated as a National Treasure of Japan. The seal is believed to have been cast in China and bestowed by Emperor Guangwu of Han upon a diplomatic official (envoy) visiting from Japan in the year 57 AD. The five Chinese characters appearing on the seal identify it as the seal of the King of Na state of Wa (Japan), vassal state of the Han Dynasty. The seal is currently in the collection of the Fukuoka City Museum in Fukuoka, Japan.  Appearance  The seal is composed of gold of 95% purity. It is made up of a square base, with the seal itself on the bottom face, and a handle on top of the base in the shape of a coiled serpent. It has a mass of 108.729 grams. The total height from base to handle is 2.236 cm. The base of the seal averages 2.347 cm on a side. This dimension roughly corresponds to the traditional Chinese standard unit of length of one cun, as used in the Later Han Dynasty (about 2.304 cm).  Characters engraved on the seal  The five characters engraved on the seal are (in the order in which they are to be read): : Êº¢ÂßîÂ•¥ÂúãÁéã The meanings of these characters (in the context of this seal) are: \\"Han\\" (referring to the Han Dynasty of China), \\"Wa\\" (an ancient name for Japan), \\"Na\\" (an ancient kingdom / state within Japan), \\"state / country\\", and \\"ruler\\". The last two characters, when combined, mean \\"king / sovereign\\". Altogether, the meaning of the seal inscription is: \\"(seal of) the King of the Na state of the Wa [vassal?] of the Han Dynasty\\". The characters are engraved in the seal script style.  History  The seal has been judged to be the one described in the Book of the Later Han, a Chinese chronicle of the history of the Eastern Han Dynasty. According to the chronicle, the Chinese Emperor Guangwu conferred the seal on a diplomatic official visiting from Japan.  Contemporary description of conferral  The following is the original Chinese text from the chronicle: :Âª∫Ê≠¶‰∏≠ÂÖÉ‰∫åÂπ¥ÔºåÂÄ≠Â•¥ÂúãÂ•âË≤¢ÊúùË≥ÄÔºå‰Ωø‰∫∫Ëá™Á®±Â§ßÂ§´ÔºåÂÄ≠Âúã‰πãÊ•µÂçóÁïå‰πü„ÄÇÂÖâÊ≠¶Ë≥ú‰ª•Âç∞Á∂¨„ÄÇ This passage can be translated into English as: :\\"In the 2nd year of the jianwu zhongyuan reign period [AD 57], the Na state of Wa sent an envoy with tribute. The envoy introduced himself as a high official. The state lies in the far south of Wa. [Emperor] Guangwu bestowed on him a seal with a tassel.\\" During the Han Dynasty, similar seals were bestowed on other regional sovereigns, in an attempt by the dynasty to bring these sovereigns into the Han ruling order.  Rediscovery  Commemorative monument near the site where the seal was uncovered in 1784 After being lost for an undetermined period of time, the seal was reportedly rediscovered on April 12, 1784, on Shika Island in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. According to contemporary reports, the seal was discovered by a farmer named Jinbei while repairing an irrigation ditch. It was found surrounded by stones forming a box-like structure around it. The stone above the seal required two adults to lift. After rediscovery, the seal was kept by the Kuroda clan, rulers of the Fukuoka Domain, and eventually donated by the Kuroda family to the city of Fukuoka in 1978.

Its neighbouring peak Muda is the fourth highest peak in the Maharashtra State under Sahyadris. Trekking Ascents of the mountain are normally made from one of two base villages. Shirpunje village is located from Rajur and is situated on the northern side of the mountain. Using this village as a start point, the peak of Ghanchakkar can be reached in around 2.5 hours. Alternatively climbers often use Kumshet village as a base and is around from Rajur. This village is used as a stopover resting place for those who trek from Ratangad to Harishchandragad via Katrabai. From Kumshet there is no direct approach to Ghanchakkar, trekkers have to climb up to the Kartabai col and from there bypass the Wakri mountain and proceed towards Muda. Then one must walk across the connecting col between Muda and Ghanchakkar to reach the Ghanchakkar's peak. Hence from Kumshet village, climbing Ghanchakkar using this route is indirect and long-winded, taking about 4 hours. Being in a remote location, these mountains are hard to reach. Treks from Ratangad to Harishchandragad, may require descent into the Katrabai and then walk to Kumshet. Lack of adequate transport facilities such as public buses in this area, requires trekkers to rely on their private vehicles and Jeeps which operate between Rajur and Kumshet/Paachnai/Ambit Bhairavgad fort near Shirpunje village can be trekked if ample amount of time present. The photographs in this article are taken from the top of Bhairavgad near Shirpunje village. Ghanchakkar Pleateau Topography Ghanchakkar and Muda combinedly have a vast plateau between their summits. Despite Ghanchakkar being the third highest peak in the Western Ghats, it is often overlooked by trekkers due to its lack of water. There is not an adequate supply of water apart from one small source which is only available during the colder months until summer at which point the plateau becomes barren. Ghanchakkar and Muda also do not offer any kind of shelter. There is a shrine of a local deity called 'Gavalidev' on Muda but it is mostly know only to the local people.

It lies about 100 metres east of the harbour at Lohme on the northern shore of the Jasmund peninsula about 20 metres off the beach in the Baltic Sea. It weighs 162 tonnes and has a volume of 60 m¬≥. It is thus the fifth largest erratic of about 20 other large glacial boulders that are part of R√ºgen's legally protected geotopes. It is stylistically portrayed in Lohme's coat of arms.  Origin and features  The Schwanenstein is made of so-called hammer granite and was very probably transported here from the island of Bornholm during the last ice age. Its reddish appearance is due to the presence of a high proportion of potassium feldspar. On its west side a marked crevice runs through the stone that, over the course of time, has been enlarged by the crystallisation pressure of frozen ice and may well result in the shearing off of a large slab of rock in the near future.  Legends and stories  Like many other erratics, the Schwanenstein is linked to several legends and stories. * According to one legend, babies were delivered on R√ºgen in summer by Adebar the stork and in winter by swans. Until then the children were hidden in the rock. * A sad incident occurred on 13 February 1956, when some boys from the orphanage and the village of Lohme were playing near the shore on the frozen Baltic Sea. The weather changed suddenly, a storm whipped up and broke the ice. Three boys saved themselves on the Schwanenstein. As the wind dramatically increased in strength a frantic rescue operation was launched. Local fishermen, a fishing boat from Sassnitz and border guards tried to save the children, but storm surge wrecked all their efforts. Rescue teams from outside, for example, an engineer platoon of the Volkspolizei from Prora, got stuck in the metre-high snowdrifts. Only the next morning, when the weather had calmed, could the bodies of the three boys, Helmut Petersen, Uwe Wassilowsky and Manfred Prewitz, be recovered from the Schwanenstein. They were buried in the cemetery of Nipmerow, in the parish of Lohme. 39 years later, on 14 February 1995, at the initiative of the children at Lohme orphanage, a memorial stone was erected at their grave.

Language history  The Black Death came to Norway in 1349, killing over 60% of the population. This probably precipitated the current process of language development. The language in Norway after 1350 until about 1550 is generally referred to as Middle Norwegian. During this period the language went through several changes: morphological paradigms were simplified, including the loss of grammatical cases and the levelling of personal inflection on verbs. An epenthetic \\"e\\" gradually appeared before the nominative ending from Old Norse to ease pronunciation. This made terms such as hestr change to hester. The -r disappeared from the language all together, and so did the epenthetic in most dialects, but some still retain this vowel. A vowel reduction also took place, in some dialects, including in parts of Norway, reducing many final unstressed vowels in a word to a common \\"e\\". The phonemic inventory also underwent changes. The dental fricatives, represented by the letters √æ and √∞, disappeared from Norwegian, either by merging with their equivalent stop consonants, represented by t and d, respectively, or by being lost altogether.  Danicisation of the written language  During the 15th century, Middle Norwegian gradually ceased to be used as a written language. At the end of the 16th century, Christian IV of Denmark (1577-1648) decided to revise and translate into Danish Magnus VI of Norway's (1238-1280) 13th century Landslov \\"Country Law\\", which was originally written in Old West Norse. In 1604 the revised version of the law was introduced. The translation of this law marks the final transition to Danish as the administrative language in Norway.

In the comic series, Shane is portrayed as a Cynthiana Sheriff's Deputy, as well as the longtime friend and fellow police officer of series protagonist Rick Grimes. After Rick is shot and put into a coma, and the zombie outbreak occurs, he rescues Rick's family and leads a group of survivors, becoming romantically involved with Rick's wife, Lori. When Rick returns to his family alive, Shane grows increasingly jealous of their relationship, as well as Rick's role in the group. In the television series' first season, Shane leads the survivors until Rick's arrival, then becomes Rick's right-hand man. The reunion is not completely amicable; in the second season, Shane develops into an antagonistic character, becoming more aggressive and unpredictable, due to his growing obsession with Lori and subsequent jealousy of Rick. He also becomes willing to abandon or kill those he deems liabilities to the group and has no moral conscience for outsiders. This puts Shane at odds with Rick's moral leadership, as he believes that Rick is ill-equipped to lead and that he, Shane, would be a better leader. Lori and Carl become his only true concern, as opposed to the group itself.  Appearances   Comic book series  Shane, as depicted in the comic book series. Shane was a police officer in Cynthiana, Kentucky, and best friend of the town's deputy sheriff, Rick Grimes. After Rick is shot and put into a coma, and after the dead begin to rise, Shane accompanies Rick's wife, Lori Grimes, and Rick's son, Carl, to a purported safe zone in Atlanta, Georgia. They later form a group of survivors living on the outskirts of the city, with Shane repeatedly telling them that the government will one day return to save them. During this time, Shane and an emotionally destitute Lori share a night of sex, something Shane had wanted for a long time. Shane is first overjoyed when Rick joins the group, but gradually becomes jealous of Rick and Lori getting back together. Eventually, Lori brushes off Shane's advances and says their brief romance must stop. Sent into an emotional meltdown by Lori siding with Rick, Shane leaves in a rage. Rick follows and Shane attempts to murder him, stating that he has nothing left to live for other than Lori. Carl happens upon the scene and shoots Shane through the neck, mortally wounding him. Rick later returns to the grave site and finds that Shane has reanimated; he shoots him in the head to finally put him to rest, but does not rebury him.  Television series = Season 1 = Prior to the zombie apocalypse, Shane is Rick Grimes's partner in the King County Sheriff's department. Rick is knocked into a coma after trying to capture escaped convicts, and Shane quickly gets him to a hospital. During the initial onset of the apocalypse, as military forces indiscriminately kill anyone alive at the hospital, Shane tries to revive Rick, but he remains in a coma, and instead Shane secures his hospital room door to keep him hidden from the military. He then helps Rick's wife Lori and son Carl evacuate towards Atlanta. They join the group that camp in a quarry near Atlanta when they find that Atlanta has been overrun. During their time at camp, Lori presumes Rick is dead, and starts a romantic relationship with Shane. Rick eventually wakes from the coma and makes his way towards Atlanta, and ends up meeting a scavenging group from the camp in the city. They bring him back to camp, both to Lori and Carl's elation and to concern to Shane. Lori ends her affair with Shane and warns Carl from being around Shane, fearing Rick would take her brief affair with Shane poorly. Further, with Rick's presence, Shane's role in the group's leadership wanes, causing him to lose his temper and self-control. When Rick decides they should head towards the CDC's Atlanta compound, Shane tries to ask Lori to convince Rick to change his mind, but Lori backs her husband. Dale sees Shane contemplating shooting Rick, and keeps his eye on him. The group meets Dr. Jenner, the last remaining researcher at the CDC, who allows them to stay. During the night, Shane gets drunk and attempts to rape Lori, but she fights back. The group learns that the CDC is running on emergency power, and will be destroyed when the fuel runs out as a means to destroy the infectious samples, and they are forced to flee just before that happens. Rick decides to lead the survivors towards Fort Benning. = Season 2 = The group is stopped on the road by a massive car pileup on the highway, and further waylaid when a walker horde passes, which ends up with Sophia Peletier running off on her own for safety. The group starts searching for her, and Shane quietly tells Lori he plans to leave the group soon. Rick, Carl, and Shane look for Sophia when Carl is accidentally shot by Otis, a farmhand from Hershel's farm, and they rush him back to the farm, where Hershel attempts to operate and remove the bullet. However, due to the severity of the wound, Hershel knows he will need more medicine, and Shane offers to go with Otis to recover this from a FEMA trailer located at a nearby school. At the school, the two recover the supplies, but both end up hurting their legs. While trying to limp to safety from a walker horde, Shane shoots Otis in the leg, using him as bait for the walkers so he can get away. Back at the farm, Shane brings the necessary medicine and claims Otis didn't make it. The others seem to accept Shane's tale, but Shane proceeds to shave his head mostly to hide a patch of hair that Otis had ripped out after being shot. Dale and Darryl later confide that they both suspect Shane of playing a larger role in Otis' death and suspect that Rick is aware as well. Shane's behavior becomes more erratic following this incident, and has further conflicts with Rick when he insists looking for Sophia is a waste of time. He helps train Andrea in firing guns, and has sex with her. Shane learns that Lori is pregnant with what may be his child, but Lori and Rick insist they will raise it as their own. When they learn that Hershel's barn is full of walkers of his family and friends, Shane insists they kill the walkers to protect themselves, and then goes to open the barn doors himself, allowing the walkers loose against Rick's and Hershel's pleas. The group kills the walkers, including the reanimated body of Sophia. After this, Hershel goes missing and Rick sets out to search for him. Lori becomes concerned when Rick doesn't return soon, and drives off to find them but gets in an accident. Shane goes out to rescue Lori, giving him a chance to apologize to her, but she remains distant from him. Rick returns with Hershel and another survivor, Randall, who was from another group that was scavenging for supplies and attacked Rick. Randall was injured during the attack, and they brought him back to be healed, but Rick says that once he is well enough, they will drive him far away from the farm. Rick and Shane go together to deposit at a distant site, but Randall reveals there he knows Maggie, Hershel's daughter. Shane believes that Randall knows the location of Hershel's farm from this and tries to kill Randall, but Rick intervenes, leading to a loud conflict that draws a walker horde. The three escape, and lock Randall back up on the farm while the group struggles with what to do with him. Shane still insists that they kill him, but the others, particularly Dale, remind them about losing their humanity in this decision. When the group seems set on letting Randall live, Shane secretly takes Randall to the nearby woods, where he breaks Randall's neck and kills him. When Rick finds Randall missing, Shane arrives at the farm and tells the group Randall ambushed him and escaped. Shane, Rick, Daryl, and Glenn take into the forest in pursuit of Randall, who they thought had escaped. The search party splits into two groups. Shane and Rick search a random area, while Glenn and Daryl follow Randall's tracks. Shane reveals to Rick that he killed Randall, after Rick concludes that Shane has lured him away from the group to kill him. Shane pulls a gun on Rick, demanding Rick to draw his weapon. Rick refuses to draw his weapon and hands his revolver to Shane; but then turns and stabs Shane with a knife in the heart, killing him. Rick sees Carl nearby, drawn in by their argument, and Carl suddenly holds a gun to Rick. He fires, but Rick sees that Carl was shooting at the reanimated body of Shane. The noise draws in a walker horde that forces Rick's group and Hershel's family to flee. When they regroup, Rick explains what happened to Shane, knowing that Shane was luring him into a trap, but they ask him how Shane reanimated despite not being bitten. Rick is forced to tell them the secret Dr. Jenner told him at the CDC: That every living human carries the virus that causes them to become walkers when they die. Rick hadn't told anyone because he didn't believe Jenner until he saw Shane reanimate without being bitten. In later seasons, Rick comes to accept that Lori's child, named Judith, was likely fathered by Shane, but he and Carl love her as if she were his own. = Season 3 = When Rick's group attacks the community of Woodbury in Season 3, Rick, who has been struggling with coming to grips with reality after the death of Lori after childbirth, pauses in surprise when he thinks he sees Shane among the Woodbury soldiers attacking his friends, and kills him. Rick approaches the body, only to find it was another Woodbury soldier. = Season 9 = Shane returns in Rick's hallucination as he struggles to lead the walkers away from construction camp despite being impaled and badly wounded by a rebar, happy to see what Rick has become and tells him to continue fighting.https://tvline.com/2018/06/18/jon-bernthal-the- walking-dead-season-9-shane-returning/ Shane's corpse appears alongside other past characters before finding Sasha Williams in his hallucination.  Development and reception  Shane Walsh was created by Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore, the writer and original artist of The Walking Dead comic book series. The character first appeared in the first issue of the comic book series in October 2003, but was expanded upon greatly in the television show adapted from the comics in 2010. As a result, Shane lives much longer in the chronology of the story in the show than he does in the comics. Kirkman described the comic book version of Shane's character as a short and quick \\"wham, bam, thank you ma'am\\" arc compared to that of his counterpart in the television series. Kirkman said he preferred the show's version of Shane and that the differences between the two versions of the character illustrate the ability to explore and evolve elements from the comic book in different ways on the show. Jon Bernthal portrayed Shane in the television series, marking the actor's most high-profile role to that date. Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln, who was eventually cast as protagonist Rick Grimes, auditioned for the show together and were the first to be chosen for the regular cast. Series creator Frank Darabont originally had all actors audition for the role of Rick, including Bernthal, and then brought back the actors under close consideration to audition for Shane and other roles. Bernthal, however, wanted to portray the part of Shane from early on and fought for the part, despite knowing that the character would die early in the series. Robert Kirkman said Shane's death was planned for the TV series adaptation \\"before the first episode of season one was shot.\\" \\"Frank Darabont had actually planned to do it at the end of the first season before he knew that the first season was going to be six episodes. Once the show was given a six-episode order it was decided that we would hold Shane‚Äôs death for the second season. But from the very first day of planning the second season it was mapped out that Shane would be kicking the bucket at the end of this season.\\"Clark Collis, 'Walking Dead' exec producer Robert Kirkman talks about tonight's episode and THAT [SPOILER!]: 'I am a madman!', Entertainment Weekly, (March 11, 2012). Bernthal said he liked playing a role he knew would end early because it allowed him to craft a full story arc from beginning to end and \\"really show the colors\\" of the character. Bernthal grew very close to Darabont and publicly voiced his disappointment when Darabont was forced out of the series. This led to speculation that Bernthal asked to be written out of the series due to Darabont's departure, but Bernthal stated that this was not the case. Kirkman said he loved Bernthal's performance as Shane and hated to see him leave the series, but felt it was necessary for the story. Likewise, Bernthal agreed with that direction for the character, and said he saw his role as \\"being a soldier for the story\\". Shane's death at the hands of Rick was the last scene Bernthal filmed for the show. The filming lasted all night until sunrise, and the entire cast attended out of respect for Bernthal, including Jeffrey DeMunn, who at that point had already left the series and flew in specifically to be there. Bernthal did not realize until very late into filming that he would portray himself as a zombie, and said he had difficulty seeing due to the contact lenses he was fitted with. He tried to convince executive director Greg Nicotero, to allow him to say the word \\"Rick\\" as a zombie, which would mark the only time a zombie spoke in the show, but the request was denied. Upon departing from The Walking Dead, Bernthal was cast as Joe Teague in Mob City, a television drama series Darabont began developing for TNT about crime in Los Angeles in the 1940s and 50s. Bernthal later returned to film a brief cameo in the third season episode \\"Made to Suffer\\", in which Rick hallucinates that he sees Shane alive. Bernthal had just concluded filming his role in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street when he returned for the scene. The Walking Dead successfully worked to keep Shane's reappearance secret until the episode aired. Shane's death was accidentally leaked by the AMC TV store on March 1, 2012 in promotional materials for the Season 2 Blu-ray set.Huge Walking Dead Spoiler Alert! AMC Accidentally Leaks Major Character's Death on DVD Ad, eonline. In reviewing Shane's death, The Atlantic wrote: \\"With Shane out of the picture in the comics, Otis doesn't die until a zombie attack that happens many issues later. And 94 issues into the series, Sophia is still going strong. (Viewed in this light, the TV series is a kind of Bizarro-World version of It's a Wonderful Life for Shane: How many lives were worse because he lived?).\\"Scott Meslow, How Faithful Should 'The Walking Dead' Be to Its Comic-Book Source?, The Atlantic, (March 12, 2012). Glen Mazzara explained why Shane became a walker in \\"Better Angels\\" much faster than Amy, and why he still turned despite not getting bit: \\"We worked hard to make sure that revelation landed. We knew what we were doing there. We knew it would land a punch. We've never had a main character become a zombie to this extent. Those [rapid flashes of zombie mayhem] represent the storm in Shane's brain to some extent ... Amy was a weaker character. Shane is in a murderous rage ... he's going to reanimate quicker. There's just more life in that zombie, believe it or not. We do have internal rules for that.\\"James Hibberd, 'Walking Dead' showrunner talks finale, controversies: 'There's more bloodshed coming', Entertainment Weekly, (March 15, 2012). At the 2012 Emerald City Comic-Con featuring a panel with Jon Bernthal and Laurie Holden, Bernthal revealed what his version of Shane's death would have been. The ending would have been the same up until the point when Shane and Rick walk into the clearing while searching for Randall. Rick would have asked why they are stopping in the field as they need to find their prisoner, to which Shane would have confessed that he had killed Randall which is a job Rick should have done himself. Shane then would have pulled his gun on Rick leading to similar dialogue between the two men as in the final episode, with the second change being that Shane would have admitted he was there to kill Rick. Rick would then have had similar dialogue as in the episode asking why he was doing this, as he thought they settled their issues in \\"18 Miles Out.\\" Rick would have then thrown his gun away, instead of holding it in a non-confrontational position, insisting that Shane would have to kill an unarmed man. Shane would have then charged Rick and putting his gun into Ricks' face using the same insults as in the final episode about Carl and Lori, but adding a new insult such as \\"I tasted your wife.\\" Rick would have then stabbed Shane to death as in the final episode, having the same dialogue as in the episode telling Shane it was his fault that he was being killed, not his own. Had Shane came back as a zombie, Rick (having thrown his gun away), would have picked up Shane's gun to shoot him. When attempting to pull the trigger Rick would come to the realization that Shane never put any ammo into his gun, and must've brought Rick out there to have him kill him, forcing Rick to finally be more like Shane. Carl would have then had shown up and killed zombified Shane, similarly again to the final episode.Comic Con Noel Murray of Rolling Stone ranked Shane Walsh 16th in a list of 30 best Walking Dead characters, saying, \\"Unhappy at being usurped, Shane (played by Daredevil's Punisher himself, Jon Bernthal) consistently undermined his friend at every turn, becoming the first ongoing TWD character to insist that the only way to make it in this new world is to leave all scruples and sentiment behind. And love him or hate him, his return as a walker remains one of the series' more memorable moments.\\"Murray, Noel (December 7, 2016). \\"30 Best 'Walking Dead' Characters\\". Rolling Stone.  Characterization  In the comics, Kirkman resolved the love triangle between Lori, Shane, and Rick very quickly, but in the TV show he decided to spend more time exploring this relationship. Bernthal said of the character in the first season, \\"I love the way that he feels about Rick [...] I love the friendship there. I love the way he uses this unbelievable dialogue that Frank [Darabont] wrote to be a good friend to Rick and to be by his side. Any time you can have a character that starts in one place and go somewhere completely different, that's the journey that we're mostly hungry for.\\" By the second season, Shane becomes the show's antagonist as his character grows darker and he finds himself at greater odds with Rick Grimes. He deteriorates throughout his run in the series, going from a confident leader who keeps the group of survivors under control to an increasingly desperate man whose actions become increasingly reactionary and morally ambiguous. However, Frank Darabont and the series producers did not seek to establish Shane as a villain because they wanted the characters to be authentic and complex rather than black-and-white. Robert Kirkman and Jon Bernthal have rejected the classification of Shane as a \\"bad guy\\" as too simplistic, noting most of his actions stem from good intentions even when they seem dangerous or irrational. They argue that Shane is primarily driven by his desire to protect the other survivors, particularly Lori, Carl and Lori's unborn child. Shane believes he has the most pragmatic view of the post-zombie world, and thus is best qualified to both lead and protect the survivors. Bernthal feels that the character becomes more and more antagonistic as he starts to lose control of the group and, in his mind, losing his ability to protect them. Shane becomes combative with Rick out of frustration upon ceasing to be the group's de facto leader. But Bernthal also feels it stems from Shane's genuine belief that Rick is too virtuous and not pragmatic enough to lead the group, and thus is a hindrance to their safety. This difference in philosophy between the two characters is illustrated in the episode \\"18 Miles Out\\", when Shane tells Rick, \\"You can't just be the good guy and expect to live. Not anymore.\\" Bernthal argued that Shane better recognized the reality of the world after the zombie outbreak and was able to adapt to it in a more severe and arguably better way than other characters like Rick. Shane shed such concepts of guilt, shame and moral correctness in favor of the concept of survival for himself and those he cares about at any cost. From that perspective, Bernthal argued Shane's killing of Otis could be interpreted as the correct course of action in this world because, by slowing Shane down, Otis was negatively affecting Shane's ability to protect the other survivors. However, Bernthal also believes Shane recognizes on some level that shutting down all emotions is an impossible task, even in a zombie-infected world, which makes the character that much more complex and multi-layered. Bernthal called Shane \\"probably the most emotional character on the show\\". While Kirkman likewise called Shane \\"one of the most nuanced characters on the show\\", he differed from Bernthal's interpretation of the character in that he believes Rick has adapted better to the new world than Shane. Kirkman believes much of Shane's actions stem from fear and that he is not as prepared for the post-zombie world as he claims. In contrast, Kirkman feels Rick is more centered and better prepared, as illustrated by his ability to act cold and detached at one moment, while kind and sympathetic in another. Kirkman called The Walking Dead \\"really a tragic story\\" for Shane, and said of the perception of the character, \\"I feel like you should be feeling sorry for Shane more than anything.\\"  References   External links  * Shane Walsh on IMDb Characters created by Robert Kirkman Comics characters introduced in 2003 Fictional American police officers Fictional characters from Georgia (U.S. state) Fictional characters from Kentucky Fictional murderers Fictional zombies and revenants Police misconduct in fiction The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"34156232","text":"Reference Re Securities Act is a landmark opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada to a reference question posed on the extent of the ability of the Parliament of Canada to use its trade and commerce power. Background Canadian securities regulation is unique in that the field is solely regulated by provincial and territorial governments. While those governments have worked to harmonize many of their policies, there is still enough variation that securities issuers must reconcile in order to have their securities trade among residents in each of the jurisdictions involved. Since the 1930s, there has been debate about the desirability of establishing a single national securities regulator. In 2010, a draft Canadian Securities Act was published, and a reference question was posed to the Supreme Court of Canada on its constitutionality. Provincial references The provincial governments of Alberta and Quebec had previously posed reference questions to their respective Courts of Appeal on the subject. In March 2011, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that the federal proposal in its entirety was an unconstitutional intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. In the same month, the Quebec Court of Appeal made a similar ruling in a 4-1 split decision, but stated that sections 148-152 and 158-168 of the proposed Act (dealing with orders for the production of information, criminal offences, prohibition orders and restitution orders) were valid under the criminal law power, and that there was no question that the Act would be constitutional if it focused solely on international and interprovincial regulation of securities transactions. The Alberta Court had considered the criminal law provisions to be so incidental to the purpose of the Act that they could not stand on their own, and it did not discuss in detail the international and interprovincial questions. Question posed Arguments offered at the hearing At issue was the question of whether the regulation of the securities industry is a valid exercise of the federal trade and commerce power. In that regard, arguments focused on the applicability of the five criteria for such an analysis that were previously identified in General Motors of Canada Ltd. v. City National Leasing: * the impugned legislation must be part of a regulatory scheme; * the scheme must be monitored by the continuing oversight of a regulatory agency; * the legislation must be concerned with trade as a whole rather than with a particular industry; * the legislation should be of a nature that provinces jointly or severally would be constitutionally incapable of enacting; and * the failure to include one or more provinces or localities in a legislative scheme would jeopardize the successful operation of the scheme in other parts of the country. If the trade and commerce power does not apply, then securities regulation, being in pith and substance under the property and civil rights power, falls exclusively within provincial jurisdiction, as the double aspect and paramountcy doctrines would not come into play. Both sides agreed that the first two General Motors criteria were met, and subsequent arguments revolved around the other three. Numerous submissions were presented to the Court on this question. There was general agreement among observers that the resulting decision will affect Canadian federalism beyond the immediate question of securities regulation. Trade as a whole Canada argued that securities law transcends all industries, and thus should be a valid exercise of the trade and commerce power, in the same way as for competition law. On the other side, it was argued that the securities industry should be viewed in the same manner as the insurance industry, which since Citizen's Insurance Co. v. Parsons has been held to fall under provincial jurisdiction. Ability of the provinces to regulate jointly or severally Canada noted that, while the provincial securities regulators efforts to operate a passport system have met with some success, there are still some significant constitutional limitations on their ability to regulate the securities industry in the modern age: * the provinces cannot apply their regulations extra-provincially; * the securities industry has become primarily international in scope; * provinces cannot regulate federally incorporated companies; and * provinces lack the ability to include criminal sanctions with their regulations Alberta, among others, argued that there were no flaws in the present passport system that could not be fixed, and that the proposed Act contained nothing that could not be found in current provincial legislation. Jeopardizing the successful operation of the scheme As the proposed Act contains an opt-in clause (providing that it would only apply in provinces that choose to participate), it was argued that this shows that unanimous provincial involvement is not necessary and that therefore this should be considered an area that the provinces are more than capable of regulating without the involvement of the Federal Government. Canada responded that this represented an example of the current model of cooperative federalism that had already been employed in agricultural products marketing, and which was approved by the Court in Reference re Agricultural Products Marketing Act. Opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada The Court held that, as presently drafted, the proposed Act is not valid under the general branch of the federal power to regulate trade and commerce. It is mainly focused on the day‚Äëto‚Äëday regulation of all aspects of contracts for securities within the provinces, including all aspects of public protection and professional competences. These matters remain essentially provincial concerns falling within property and civil rights in the provinces and are not related to trade as a whole. Specific aspects of the Act aimed at addressing matters of genuine national importance and scope going to trade as a whole in a way that is distinct from provincial concerns, including management of systemic risk and national data collection, appear to be related to the general trade and commerce power. With respect to these aspects of the Act, the provinces, acting alone or in concert, lack the constitutional capacity to sustain a viable national scheme. In sum, the proposed Act overreaches genuine national concerns. While the economic importance and pervasive character of the securities market may, in principle, support federal intervention that is qualitatively different from what the provinces can do, they do not justify a wholesale takeover of the regulation of the securities industry which is the ultimate consequence of the proposed federal legislation. A cooperative approach that permits a scheme recognizing the essentially provincial nature of securities regulation while allowing Parliament to deal with genuinely national concerns remains available and is supported by Canadian constitutional principles and by the practice adopted by the federal and provincial governments in other fields of activities. Addressing the nature of this question within the context of Canadian federalism, the Court noted: Significance The immediate effect of the decision: * The real question at hand was about the nature of Canadian federalism in dealing with a matter that does not fall squarely within either federal or provincial jurisdiction. * The trade and commerce power, as originally conceived in Parsons and clarified in General Motors, is still good constitutional law that does not need to be revisited. * The property and civil rights power is adequate for dealing with the day-to-day aspects of securities regulation, as they do not possess a national dimension. * Certain aspects of the proposed Act would be valid, but only those with a national dimension, international and interprovincial elements, or that are related to the criminal law power. The Federal Government has confirmed that it will not proceed with the proposed Act. There is currently extensive discussion as to the best manner for any reform to proceed. Certain observers agree that a national regulatory authority with a more focused brief is still possible under other heads of federal power, as is the option of instituting a cooperative framework with the provinces. There is debate as to the likelihood of the provinces' cooperation. In January 2012, Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty stated that work is still continuing with the provinces to create a national regulator that would function within the bounds that the Court declared was within federal jurisdiction. There is also concern that, viewed on the general principles of the opinion with respect to the boundary between federal jurisdiction and the provincial property and civil rights power, the following recently enacted federal statutes may also be on constitutionally shaky ground: * Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and * Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam Act, as well as * amendments adopted in 2012 to insert digital rights management provisions into the Copyright Act References Canadian federalism case law Supreme Court of Canada cases 2011 in Canadian case law Supreme Court of Canada reference question cases ","title":"Reference Re Securities Act"},{"id":"34156254","text":"Leszek Nowosielski may refer to: * Leszek Nowosielski (footballer) (born 1992), Polish footballer * Leszek Nowosielski (fencer) (born 1968), Canadian fencer * Leszek Nowosielski (painter) (1918‚Äì2000), Polish painter ","title":"Leszek Nowosielski"},{"id":"34156256","text":"Heybatgulu Mammadbayov () was an Azerbaijani statesman who served as State Controller in the fifth cabinet of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and was member of Parliament of Azerbaijan.

Reuters news agency included the attack in its list of deadliest attacks in 2011. The Al-Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for killing 65 people and wounding over 100. At the time the United States Armed Forces were withdrawing. Tikrit was Saddam Hussein's birthplace. Description of incident On 29 March 2011, gunmen from the Islamic State of Iraq wearing suicide belts hidden under military uniforms entered Tikrit, Iraq. The men presented themselves as Iraqi soldiers when they arrived at the security checkpoint. After being told they needed to be searched, they open fired on the guards. Around 1 p.m., attackers blew up a car to create a diversion by the council headquarters. Following the car bombing, the gunmen proceeded to take control over the second floor of the Saladin provincial council's headquarters. The provincial council meets every Tuesday, but according to Ali Abdul Rihman, a spokesperson for the governor, the local politicians had ended the meeting early because there was little to cover on their agenda. Therefore, many had already left the building. The gunmen did execute three councilmen, including Abdullah Jebara who was an outspoken critic of Al-Qaeda and terrorists, with shots to their heads and set fire to their bodies in front of the hostages. Insurgents were still carrying out attacks during the U.S. withdrawal and the transfer of powers to the Iraqis. As security reinforcements were arriving, another car bomb went off at the entrance of the council building. A five-hour standoff ensued. Ahmed Abdullah, Saladin's governor, explained a fierce shootout between what he believed to be at least eight gunmen that had taken over the council building, hurling grenades at the Iraqi security forces that surrounded the building. Fifteen hostages were killed execution style during the captivity. The attack also killed two journalists, who were Sabah al-Bazi and Muammar Khadir Abdelwahad. Both journalists were covering a provincial council meeting. Iraqi Army forces together with US troops stormed the building, at which point the attackers blew up their explosives, which brought an end to the standoff. The bodies of six attackers were taken to the hospital where sources say the cause of death for two of the bodies had occurred from detonating their vest, while the other four deaths were the result of gunshot wounds. Several U.S. troops were said to have been wounded by a military spokespersonn. This incident killed 65 people and wounded 100. Several days later the Islamic State of Iraq officially claimed credit for the attack. Casualties in journalism Sabah Al-Bazi Sabah Al-Bazi (22 March 1981 in Samarra ‚Äì 29 March 2011) (also Romanized as al-Bazee), 30, died as a result of shrapnel from the bombing. He was assigned to cover a weapons cache discovery but was diverted by assault and killed by fire while covering operation. He worked for Al- Arabiya, CNN, Reuters and other international media as a freelance journalist. He had worked for Reuters since 2004 and CNN since 2006. Among his notable reporting assignments was the 2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing. Al-Bazi was from Saladin Governorate, married, and had three children. Muammar Khadir Abdelwahad Muammar Khadir Abdelwahad, 39, also died during the incident, but the cause of death is uncertain. He was a reporter for Al-Ayn news agency. According to the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, Ayn stated he was in contact with the agency while in the building and then was quoted saying, \\"We lost contact at the moment of the assault by the security forces. We later learned that he was dead.\\" Impact The 29 March terrorist attack in Tikrit, Iraq was listed as one of the deadliest attacks in Iraq in 2011.

The various process steps of a brewery can be automated, controlled and monitored via the software components of the brewmaxx range.  Fields of application  Due to its scalability, brewmaxx is suited to applications ranging from single station to multi-server systems. It is used in: * small breweries (up to 50 hectolitres per brew) * medium-sized breweries (up to 1 million hectolitres per annum) * large breweries (more than 1 million hectolitres per annum) The main fields of application include the automation of breweries (see brewery) and/or fermenting and storage cellars. Also a complete automation of all the production areas of a brewery (e.g. at Warsteiner Beer and Brewery) - from raw material intake to filling - can be realised with the brewmaxx process control systems. The ‚Äúsmall‚Äù control system, brewmaxx compact, has been available for individual production areas, e.g. ancillary plants, water treatment, filter or CO2 plants as well as small and medium-sized breweries, since the middle of 2010. The systems and modules of brewmaxx are generally used for the automation of new plants and for migration projects. Existing, outdated control systems with a structured software design can be migrated to brewmaxx via conversion tools. brewmaxx is used as teaching system for process control technology for breweries at the Technical University Munich. Various university projects use brewmaxx as process controlling system.Technical University Munich, Lehrstuhl f√ºr Lebensmittelverpackungstechnik: Fully automated mini-brewery  Architecture  The brewmaxx range is based on an integrated client-server model and uses standard Microsoft software. The architecture has a modular design. Depending on the requirements, the modules can be used individually or in combination for process control, data acquisition, process management, production management and enterprise resource planning level integration. brewmaxx has been designed as a multi-lingual system. At application level, it offers a computer-dependent language changeover option for the user interface and can be configured in several languages. Communication takes place via the Ethernet connections TCP/IP and OPC. OPC (see OLE for process control) is preferably used as the interface; however, various OPC servers might be used depending on the control units to be integrated. Furthermore, a driver-based interface is available for non OPC- capable systems. This ensures simple and flexible integration of numerous control systems, e.g. from Mitsubishi Electric, Allen-Bradley, Siemens, VIPA and others. Various reporting functions enable selective access to recorded process and material data. ;Modules brewmaxx material is a process-oriented material management system, offering a precise ‚Äòper transaction‚Äô online view of all material movements. Besides inventory management, the acquisition of this information also enables research, statistical evaluations and batch tracking. The brewmaxx integrate module records process-relevant information from different plants and process areas and enables their division-independent integration with regard to information management. The reporting component of brewmaxx integrate works also with web-based clients. brewmaxx connect is a freely parameterisable interface for universal data exchange between brewmaxx systems and various third party systems. These include client/server or host- based systems, e.g. ERP, LIMS and maintenance systems, but also intelligent measuring and analysis instruments (e.g. inspectors and weighing systems).  Standards  Production data acquisition with brewmaxx Acquis iT is based on the Weihenstephan Standards.Weihenstephan Standards (WS) In cooperation with industry representatives and with the support of Wissenschaftsf√∂rderung der Deutschen Brauwirtschaft, the chair of Food Packaging Technology at the Technical University Munich in Weihenstephan has developed a standard for the connection of BDE systems to bottling plants. The standard includes the uniform provision and structure of data from the control units of various manufacturers. The Weihenstephan Standards 2000 comprise the guidelines for standard BDE specifications for bottling plants; the Weihenstephan Standards 2005 describe the interfaces and data provision for bottling and packaging plants in the beverage industry.

History  The predecessor systems of the brewmaxx platform already provided the technological functions (TF) for brewery-specific requirements. The big brother of brewmaxx is the process control system Plant iT, developed and distributed by ProLeiT AG. Plant iT is the industry-independent solution for the following areas: food & beverages, dairy industry, feeding stuff, pharma & chemical industry, biodiesel & bioethanol. In many areas, it is identical to the brewmaxx components, but additionally comprises an ISA 88 compliant batch system (see Batch production).

Eine Untersuchung der Thatsachen und Gesetze des sittlichen LebensWundt (1897) Ethics, an investigation of the facts and laws of the moral life translated from the second German edition (1892)txwes.edu Voluntarism, Structuralism, and Other Early Approaches to Psychology This principle is exemplified in the emergence of new motives during the course of a chain of activities. For example, one may accept the invitation of a friend to attend an art show. Initially, the motive is simply the anticipation of a pleasant evening in good friendship, but in the course of the evening, one encounters a highly desirable work of art and wishes to purchase it. A whole new set of motives now enters the picture and now exist alongside and in addition to the original motive. The Heterogeny of Ends formulates that an ongoing behavioral sequence must often be understood in terms of ever-shifting patterns of primary and secondary goals. Another example would be how cat chasing a mouse may suddenly find it necessary to compete with a partner, overcome an unexpected barrier, or avoid a danger. Ends, goals, and purposes keep changing.Cantfort History & Systems The original German expression was Heterogonie der Zwecke, variously translated in English as heterogony/heterogeneity/heterogenesis of ends/goals/purposes.Schneider, Louis (1986)Paradox and society: the work of Bernard Mandeville pp. 172‚Äì73 It was first formulated by Wundt in 1886, in his book Ethics.Nicola Abbagnano and Giovanni Fornero (2004) Diccionario de filosof√≠a p. 542 Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico is sometimes credited as having anticipated and influenced Wundt's idea.Max Harold Fisch Introduction to the English translation of The new science of Giambattista Vico, p.xxxii Notes and references Concepts in ethics Psychological concepts ","title":"Heterogony of ends"},{"id":"34156512","text":"Biebel is the title character of a Flemish satirical comic strip series written by Marc Legendre, under the pseudonym of Ikke.

The Mahisasan-Shahbajpur route has not been operational since December, 1996 due to lack of traffic. History In response to the demand of the Assam tea planters for a railway link to Chittagong port, Assam Bengal Railway started construction of a railway track on the eastern side of Bengal in 1891. A track between Chittagong and Comilla was opened to traffic in 1895. The Comilla-Akhaura-Kulaura-Badarpur section was opened in 1896-1898 and finally extended to Lumding in 1903. Mahisasan was a station on this track. With the partition of India in 1947, it assumed importance as a border station. Broad gauge The Railway Budget for 2011-12 has approved the conversion of the metre gauge Karimganj-Mahisasan section to broad gauge. Now this a broad gauge single track non electrified line. Currently 2 passenger trains are running in this line from Silchar, Maishashan Silchar Passenger Metre Gauge Earlier it was functioning as a Metre Gauge railway station, but after 2015, it was upgraded to BG Trans-Asian Railway Currently, all freight traffic originating from Asia destined for Europe goes by sea. The Trans-Asian Railway will enable containers from Singapore, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Korea to travel over land by train to Europe. The Southern Corridor of the Trans-Asian Railway is of prime interest to India. It connects Yunnan in China and Thailand with Europe via Turkey and passes through India. There is a general understanding between India and Myanmar that their railways will be interconnected via a 346-km line section that will extend from Kalay in Myanmar to Jiribam in India via the border point at Tamu / Moreh. The proposed route will enter India through Tamu and Moreh in Manipur bordering Myanmar, then enter Bangladesh through Mahisasan and Shahbajpur and again enter India from Bangladesh at Gede. On the western side, the line will enter Pakistan at Attari. There is a missing link on this route in the India-Myanmar sector; of this, , in India, is between Jiribam in Manipur and Tamu in Myanmar.

Overview  Standage's book is divided into 6 major sections starting in prehistoric times and advancing up to present day. The six sections are: :1: Edible Foundations Of Civilization (Neolithic Revolution transforms hunter- gatherers to agriculturalists.) :2: Food And Social Structure (Food as wealth: sedentary societies that store food create inequalities in wealth and power.) :3: Global Highways Of Food (Luxury goods such as spices motivate a quest for wealth via exploration and colonization) :4: Food, Energy, And Industrialization (New World crops and fossil fuels expand agricultural productivity and non-farm occupations leading to Industrial Revolution, but monoculture leads to famine.) :5: Food As A Weapon (Military and political leaders benefit from power over food supply to mobilize armies and to crush dissent.) :6: Food, Population, And Development (The Green Revolution of the 20th century solves some problems but then creates new ones.) The first section introduces hunting and gathering to the reader, but quickly moves on to agriculture and farming techniques, which enabled a great expansion of population. Standage defends his thesis that farming is a man-made, unnatural system. He does so by discussing the history of maize, an altered, man-made crop. Maize is a major topic in this book as it has become a major staple throughout the world today. Standage also mentions wheat and rice, which were also important cereal grains, often involved in certain religious beliefs of people. Moving into the second section, Standage claims that sedentary (farming) communities with the ability to store food gave rise to economic and political inequality, and hence to government, social structure, laws, culture, and almost every aspect of life that humans possess today. In the third section, Standage describes the European desire for spices that could only be purchase by way of Arabia from Asia. Because of the high (and rising) cost of spices, European governments invested in exploration, such as the voyages of Columbus and Magellan. The theories of Thomas Malthus (that the world's growing population could not be supported by the agriculturally based food supply) are a recurring theme throughout this book. In section four, Standage shows how two particular innovations of the 18th century (New World crops and replacement of wood with coal for fuel) increased agricultural productivity and made industrialization possible. This section also showcases a darker side of innovation as potato monoculture led to the Great Famine in Ireland beginning in 1845. Control of the food supply has been, as Standage shows, an important source of power for military and political leaders. In Section Five (Food as a Weapon), Standage talks about the strategies, including developing food preservation techniques, that Napoleon used to feed his troops. Provisioning armies is only one side of this use of power, however. Standage also describes the deaths from hunger of people whose leaders chose to deprive them of food. In the final section of the book, Standage discusses the Green Revolution, a breakthrough in farming technologies and techniques that occurred in the 1940s to roughly the 1970 which greatly increased crop yields. Standage told an NPR interviewer that he thinks of food, not as the central motivating force of human history, but as \\"an invisible fork\\" that prods humankind. \\"After all,\\" Standage says, \\"everything that every person has ever done, throughout history, has literally been fueled by food.\\" Reception An Edible History of Humanity generally received both positivehttp://civileats.com/2009/10/28/on-an-edible-history-of- humanity%E2%80%94or-how-food-has-influenced-our-history/ and mixed reviews.http://www.wine-economics.org/journal/details- content/volume-5-2010-no-2/book-review-tom-standage-an-edible-history-of- humanity/ Tom Jaine of The Guardian says that Tom \\"makes a brilliant stab at bringing sense to the table.\\" Howard Schneider, writing in The Humanist, regrets that the book does not treat more food topics in depth but calls it overall \\"engrossing, thoughtful, and thought-provoking.\\" Other critique has been made over the author‚Äôs position on the agricultural revolution.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/5604296/Is- farming-the-root-of-all- evil.htmlhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227081-800-review-an-edible- history-of-humanity-by-tom-standage/  References  Standage, Tom.

He is a specialist in the thought of Immanuel Kant, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Martin Heidegger. His research focuses on hermeneutics, phenomenology, German classical philosophy and the history of metaphysics.  Education and career  After completing his philosophical studies at the University of Montreal, he wrote a thesis on the concept of truth in hermeneutics in 1982 at the University of T√ºbingen, where he also studied classical philology and theology. He taught at Universit√© Laval, in Quebec City from 1982 to 1990 and at the University of Ottawa in the academic year 1990-1991. Grondin has taught at the University of Montreal since 1991. In addition to his authored volumes, translated into more than twelve languages, he is also the author of many articles in various philosophical journals. His two volumes on Kant continue to be authoritative and his major contributions on the universality of hermeneutics and phenomenology place Grondin in a Platonic philosophical tradition that goes back to Augustine and passes through Kant, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer. He can be seen as the principal advocate for the work of Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur and is prominent in contemporary hermeneutics. He was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2012. In 2014 Jean Grondin was awarded the Molson Prize.  Influences and work  The influence of Gadamer and his magnum opus Truth and Method (Warheit und Methode; 1960) is apparent in much of Grondin's work.J. Grondin, Hermeneutische Wahrheit? Zum Wahrheitsbegriff Hans-Georg Gadamers (Hanstein: Forum Academicum, 1982). Grondin has also written the first intellectual biography of Gadamer, Hans-Georg Gadamer: A Biography.J. Grondin, Hans-Georg Gadamer: A Biography (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003). This book was eagerly awaited in Germany, in part due to the confirmed Nazism of Gadamer's teacher and friend, Martin Heidegger, and the question of Gadamer's own sympathies during World War II. Grondin's most well-known work is The Universality of Hermeneutics (1993), which has been translated into twelve languages.J. Grondin, L'universalit√© de l'herm√©neutique (Paris: PUF, 1993). Grondin here defends the concept of a hermeneutics founded on the universality of interior language: behind discourse itself, understanding is held to be an interior sense that exceeds the limited terms of exterior language. This concept is further developed in his essay, \\"On the Meaning of Life\\"' (2003), wherein Grondin argues for an immanent meaning of life based on this internalized discourse. Grondin has also worked extensively on German idealism, the hermeneutics of Wilhelm Dilthey and Ricoeur, the theory of interpretation put forward by Emilio Betti, the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida, and the new phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion. Grondin has, in addition to this original work, produced translations of many of Gadamer's writings.

It was constructed between 1568 and 1570 under personal supervision of Tsar Ivan the Terrible in the period when Vologda was the capital of the Oprichnina lands in Russia, and completed in 1587. The cathedral is located on the right bank of the Vologda River, just outside the former fortress known as the Vologda Kremlin. The cathedral was designated by the Russian government as an architectural monument of federal significance (#3510063013). History The cathedral was built in 1568-1570, when Ivan the Terrible introduced the Oprichnina and made Vologda its capital. The model after which the cathedral was built was the Assumption Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin. Ivan personally supervised the construction, and the builders were permitted to use almost unlimited resources. Ivan also, for unknown reason, ordered the cathedral's unusual orientation: its altar apse does not face east as is common in Orthodox Churches but rather northeast. In 1571, Ivan the Terrible unexpectedly left Vologda and returned to Moscow. Soon afterwards, he abolished the Oprichnina and never showed any further interest in Vologda. He even gave an order for the cathedral to be demolished before he left the city, but subsequently withdrew it. By that time, the cathedral was constructed but not yet decorated or consecrated. The cathedral was completed during the reign of Feodor Ivanovich, the son of Ivan the Terrible, and consecrated in 1587. A legend says that the reason Ivan the Terrible left Vologda and ordered the demolition of unfinished cathedral was that during his visit on the construction site a brick from the bell tower fell on his head. –ò–≤–∞–Ω –°–ª–æ–±–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π. –õ–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å–µ—Ü. 1716 –≥–æ–¥ The frescoes inside the cathedral were made between 1685 and 1687 by a group of painters from Yaroslavl under the direction of Dmitry Plekhanov. The bell-tower of the cathedral is the highest construction in Vologda, and is high. The first wooden bell-tower of the cathedral was built at the end of the 16th century. The octagonal stone bell-tower was built in 1654-1659. The vaulted dome of the bell-tower in the pseudo-gothic style was built in 1869 by Vladimir Schildknecht, the chief architect of Vologda Governorate, by order of Bishop Palladius. The bells have proper names. The Big Holiday Bell was cast in 1687, the Water Carrier Bell was cast in 1643, the Watch Bell was cast in 1627, the Archangel Bell was cast in 1689, the Big Swan Bell was cast in 1689, and the Little Swan Bell was cast in 1656. The Bell-tower also known as a Watch tower. The chimes have been manufactured on the Brothers Gutenop factory in Moscow in 1871. The observation deck has a panoramic view. In Soviet times, the cathedral was shut down and now it serves as a museum.

Ove Von Spaeth studied graphic design at The Graphic Arts Institute of Denmark and in the decades following the 1960s became known for his psychedelic poster designs, publications and articles relating to Indian music, art, and spirituality. In the 1970s, von Spaeth began studying ancient history, religions, and astronomy. His analysis of earliest known star map in Egypt - the ‚ÄòSenmut star-map‚Äô Novakovic, Bojan. Senenmut: An Ancient Egyptian Astronomer. http://publications.aob.rs/85/pdf/019-023.pdf lead to von Spaeth publishing an exact dating of its time and period in Egyptian history and of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut. Dating the Oldest Egyptian Star Map (2000) By using astronomical approach on the Senmut map, von Spaeth computed and verified the presence of distinctive planetary conjunctions represented as a factual occurrence in the sky. This allowed the calculation of an exact dating of its time and thus the period in Egyptian history. Books by Ove von Spaeth Images of Cities (1966) The book is an experiment in visual effects of images from cities around the world. Von Spaeth tries to enhanced the emotional experience of urban environments by using long exposures and typographic compositions containing multiple levels of printed text Psychedelic ‚Äô67 (1967 & 1969) Von Spaeth's typographic experimental book tried to capture a slice of contemporary history as it was unfolding in Denmark. The book‚Äôs psychedelic subject is formulated through the author‚Äôs artistic layout and visual arrangement. The Moses book Series The series of five books on the biblical figure Moses, is a semi fictional work based on ancient textual sources such as the Rabbinical Writings‚Äô, archaeological evidence, and astronomical data. Von Spaeth attempts to develop a historical alternative view of Moses Egyptian background. =The Suppressed Record: Moses‚Äô Unknown Egyptian Background (1999) = In the first book of a series, von Spaeth suggests that Moses was an Egyptian prince and heir to the throne who found himself disinherited and forced into exile as a result of complex plots and intrigues at the royal court of Pharaohs Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III (approx. 1500 BC). The book had a good reception though it failed to get scientific recognition from the Danish Carsten Niebuhr Institute. =The Enigmatic Son of Pharaoh‚Äôs Daughter: Moses‚Äô Identity and Mystery Re-evaluated (2000) = The second book suggests that Moses was born to Queen Hatshepsut 3500 years ago, rose to power as a high-ranking leader among the Egyptian elite, was ousted in a coup, along with his mother, and records of his existence were systematically erased. Von Speath devots a significant portion of the book to draw parallels between Moses and Queen Hatshepsut‚Äôs chief consul Senmut. The reception of the second book was very positive one critic calling it \\"especially impressive\\". Though others found it scientific lacking, but excellent as crime fiction. =The Vanished Successor: Rediscovering Moses‚Äô Hidden War Leading to the Exodus (2001) = In the third book Moses is an exiled prince who repeatedly tries to regain his claim to the throne of the pharaohs by coordinating a series of strategic uprisings in the margins of the Egyptian empire and a rebellion of Hebrew migrant workers. As the rebellion foils the workers start seeking their own land and sovereignty. =The Secret Religion: Moses and the Egyptian Heritage in the Past and Present (2004)= The fourth book in von Spaeth‚Äôs Moses-series deals with relations between ancient Egyptian mystery cults and early Hebrew spiritual traditions. The book suggest that of the cults were politically active and intervening in specific historical events of the ancient world leading to cultural consequences for the western world. =Prophet and Unknown Genius: Illuminating Moses the Advanced Pioneer (2005)= The final book in the series suggests that Moses skills derived from his legacy as a prince helped him unify the Israelite people by providing them with philosophy, political science, mathematics, and the development of a written system of language with its own alphabet enabling a formation of the biblical texts.

It was based in New Orleans, Louisiana, and played a prominent role in the Siege of Port Hudson. Its members included a minority of free men of color from New Orleans; most were African-American former slaves who had escaped to join the Union cause and gain freedom. A predecessor regiment by the same name, 1st Louisiana Native Guard (CSA), had served in the militia of Confederate Louisiana. It was made up entirely of free men of color. Union regiment formed After New Orleans fell to Admiral David Farragut in April 1862, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler headquartered his 12,000-man Army of the Gulf in New Orleans. On September 27, 1862, Butler organized the Union Army's 1st Louisiana Native Guard regiment, some of whose members had served in the previous Confederate Native Guard regiment. Free men of color had served with the militia since the French colonial period. But the regiment's initial strength was 1,000 men, and it was composed mostly of African-American former slaves who had escaped to freedom.Terry L. Jones (2012-10-19) \\"The Free Men of Color Go to War\\" - NYTimes.com. Opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-18. The Union commissioned several African-American line officers of the Guard. Former Confederate Lt. Andre Cailloux, a Creole of color (free man of color) in New Orleans, was named captain of Company E. P. B. S. Pinchback, also a free man of color, was appointed as captain of Company A, and later was reassigned as company commander of the 2nd Regiment. (He later served as governor of the state, as a US Representative and Senator.) James Lewis, a mixed-race, former steward on the Confederate river-steamer De Soto, was commissioned as captain of company K. During this period, some slaves who escaped from nearby plantations joined the regiment, but the Union Army's official policy discouraged such enrollments. In November 1862, the number of escaped slaves seeking to enlist became so great that the Union organized a second regiment and, a month later, a third regiment. The field-grade officers of these regiments (colonels, lieutenant colonels, and majors) were white men, with the notable exception of Major Francois (Francis) Ernest Dumas of the 2nd Regiment, a Creole of color. Colonel Spencer Stafford, formerly Butler's military \\"mayor\\" of New Orleans, was the original white commander of the 1st Louisiana Native Guard. Banks purges black line officers After General Nathaniel P. Banks replaced Butler as Commander of the Department of the Gulf, he began a systematic campaign to purge all the black or colored line officers from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments of the Louisiana Native Guard. He secured the resignations of all the black line officers in the 2nd Regiment in February 1863, but most of the black line officers in the 1st Regiment and 3rd Regiment remained. Siege of Port Hudson Troops of the Louisiana Native Guard disembarking at Fort Macomb, Louisiana, for guard duty. A depiction of the death of Andre Cailloux in battle. Cailloux can be seen with his sword raised. This portrayal places Cailloux and his men much closer to the Confederates than they were. From Frank Leslie's Journal, June 27, 1863. Funeral of Andre Cailloux in New Orleans, July 29, 1863, from the August 29, 1863, edition of Harpers Weekly From its formation in September 1862 until early May 1863, the 1st Louisiana Native Guard largely performed fatigue duty-chopping wood, gathering supplies, and digging earthworks. From January 1863 to May 1863, the regiment also guarded the railway depots along the rail line between Algiers (south of the Mississippi River, now part of New Orleans) to Brashear City (now called Morgan City). By this time, the Guard's numbers had diminished to 500. Troops of the Native Guards were assigned guard duty at Fort Macomb, Fort Pike, Fort Massachusetts (Mississippi), Fort St. Philip, and Fort Jackson.\\"Native Guard Regiments\\", Lest We Forget, Hampton University In mid-1863, the 1st Louisiana Native Guard, along with the 3rd Louisiana Native Guard, had its first chance at combat. These units participated in the first assault at Milliken's Bend in the Siege of Port Hudson on May 27, as well as the second assault on June 14. Captain Cailloux died heroically in the first assault. Cailloux's body, as well as those of the other members of the 1st Louisiana Native Guard who fell with him that day, was left on the field of battle until the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9, 1863. News of his heroism reached New Orleans, and Cailloux received a hero's funeral in the city with a large procession and thousands of attendees along the route on July 29. Redesignation and legacy Map of early African-American involvement in the Civil War, including the Native Guard at Pascagoula and Port Hudson In June 1863, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Louisiana Native Guard Regiments were redesignated as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Corps d'Afrique. Perhaps 200 to 300 of the original 1,000 members of the 1st Louisiana Native Guard made this transition. Poor treatment by white soldiers and difficult field conditions resulted in many black officers resigning and enlisted soldiers deserting the Corps. In April 1864 the Corps d'Afrique was dissolved, and its members joined the newly organized 73rd and 74th Regiments of the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army. By the end of the war, about 175,000 African Americans had served in the 170 regiments of the United States Colored Troops. In contrast to the 1st Louisiana Native Guards organization, all field and line officers of the United States Colored Troops were white. At the war's end, approximately 100 of the original 1,000 members of the First Louisiana Native Guard still remained in uniform in either the 73rd or 74th Regiments. The Union Army's 1st Louisiana Native Guard regiment in September 1862 was not made up only of men from the Confederate Guard. Of the nearly 1,000 enlisted soldiers of the Confederate Native Guards, only 107 were recorded as enlisting in the Union \\"Native Guard\\", and only ten of the 36 officers served the Union. The free men of color had varying reasons for volunteering to serve with the Confederacy, in part to preserve their own standing in the society, just as others did. P.B.S. Pinchback, who came from the North to serve here, and others like him were free men of color who joined the Union militia for the first time and distinctly for that cause. Most of the Guard soldiers were African Americans who had escaped from slavery and joined the Union effort. Some historians think the legend of continuity of the regiments was a propaganda ploy by Union General Benjamin F. Butler.

It had its capital at what is now Autl√°n, Jalisco, but stretched southward to the coast at Puerto de la Navidad and northward into the interior as far as Ameca, Jalisco. This area was inhabited by many diverse people prior to the Spanish incursion. Among them were speakers of Western Otomi languages, Bapame, Auteco, Cuyoteco, Otontlatolli, Cazcan and Totonac. At the time of the Spanish incursion the area was divided between the states of Ahuacapan, Ameca, Apimila-Coyutla, Aohtlan, Atenco, Axotla, Ayaoquila, Ayotitlan, Ayotlan (with vassal territories at Tlepantequipa and Tenamaxtlan), Chipiltitlan, Cichuatlan, Cuetzalan, Epatalan (with vassal domains at Tetlixtla and Tzoquitlan), Instlichanga, Ixtlahuacan, Maloastla, Milpa (vassal domains at Aohtlan and Tlacapatlan), Mixtlan, Nocheztlan, Ocuiltepec, Tequecistalan (vassal domain at Acautlan), Tenamaxtlan, Tecolotla, Tecuxuacan, Teutlichanga (vassal domain at Tomatlan), Tlacaltexcal (vassal domains at Acapangal, Cuitlatlan and Zacapala), Tlacanahuac, Tlaquexpan, Tlilan, Xalipanga, Xiquitlan and Xonacatlan. The Spanish captured all these states in 1523-1524. The corrigemento was established in 1534.

In 2011 she reached the semi-finals of the German television show The Voice of Germany. Originally she was established as a rock singer in the band Super Massive Object and later in Captive Audio.  Early life  Sharron Levy was born in Haifa in Israel and grew up in Tel Aviv. At the age of nine she relocated with her mother and brother to London, England. After attending a Jewish primary school in London, she went on to a Jewish boarding school Carmel College in Oxfordshire where she stayed until the age of sixteen. Following Carmel College, Levy completed a performing arts course in Henley College which inspired her to learn more about the production side of the arts and she moved to Newcastle upon Tyne to study Music Production.  Bands  Levy's first band was One Drop, an already established band searching for a singer. She spent two years with the band performing shows around the Newcastle area. One Drop's drummer, Andy Walker and Levy left One Drop to form a new band ‚Äì Super Massive Object (SMO). SMO gave Levy a chance to write and perform her own songs and co-write with Walker. After four years and a number of line up changes, Super Massive Object split up. A short while later Levy joined Anthony Bye (bass) and Paul Kirk (drums) who were seeking a singer. The trio became Captive Audio with Levy playing guitar and singing lead vocals. Captive Audio performed across the UK and recorded an album: Visceral. The band relocated to London to build on their growing success. The band split shortly after and the album was never released although some of the tracks are still available as free downloads on the band's website.  Solo work  Levy's solo work started with a recording of an album with producer and songwriter Bryan Steele in 2009. However, this album was never released. In July 2010 Levy recorded a 7 track EP Unplugged And Then Plugged In Again produced by herself and Anthony Bye. A limited 100 copies were made and the EP is now only available as download through Amazon, iTunes and other websites. In August 2010 Levy relocated to Salzburg in Austria. There she performed regularly in Shamrock Irish Pub and was beginning to build a name for herself.  The Voice of Germany  Levy auditioned for the casting show The Voice of Germany in July 2011. She attended the Munich auditions and was then invited to the \\"blind auditions\\" where she was selected into Nena's team. Levy qualified for the live shows where, in February 2012, she reached the semi- finals with the best eight participants. Her appearances on the show resulted in two minor hits in the German charts, one a cover, the other her own composition \\"Drowning\\". In September 2012 Sharron was supported by ex SMO drummer Jae Brooks and bass player Keith Mills on a 16 date tour of Germany.  2013 onwards  In 2013 Levy released her first album \\"Rough_Ready\\" which failed to chart. The album had contributions from several members of Nena's band, Levy being the support act at a number of Nena's concerts throughout 2013 and 2014. In October 2014, Levy released a new track, \\"Punk Thursday\\", as a precursor to her second solo album \\"I am me\\" which was eventually released in June 2018.

History The Nigerian Management Group was formed in 1961 as the first management institute in Nigeria. The organization was renamed the Nigerian Institute of Management in 1964 and incorporated as a non-profit company. On 19 June 2003 the National Assembly passed the Nigerian Institute of Management Establishment Act 2003. This gave the NIM the formal authority to regulate the management profession in Nigeria. In December 2005 the Institute was waiting for the Jigawa State government to provide a site on which the institute could build a management center. Business leaders' platform In November 2006 NIM President Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar, after describing how political leaders had stolen $480 billion since 1960, said that all sectors of the economy were suffering from endemic management failure. In December 2007 the new NIM President Sir Peter Edeoghon said he would focus on ways to improve the institute's performance in regulating the industry and promoting best practices. In November 2008, Edeoghon called on the federal government to increase investment in the non- oil sector. The November 2008 International Management Conference of the NIM wound up with a call for a change in the government's emphasis to a focus on wealth creation rather than poverty reduction. The two-day conference was held jointly with the Association of Management Organisations in Africa (AMOA). Politicians' platform NIM meetings provide an opportunity for politicians to address senior business leaders. In August 2002 President Olusegun Obasanjo called on NIM members to lead the fight against corruption. At the September 2009 annual meeting of the NIM, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua praised the NIM for its commitment to the development of Nigeria. At the September 2010 annual meeting President Goodluck Jonathan, represented by Civil Service Head Stephen Oronsaye, pledged to fight corruption and urged the members to assist in this cause. In July 2011 Chief Emeka Anyaoku gave the NIM's golden jubilee lecture on the topic: \\"Nigeria at 50: The Challenges of Nationhood\\". Talking about the recent attack in Abuja by Boko Haram members he called for a national conference on security to review Nigeria's structural problems and to end the immunity of senior politicians.

Each resulting traffic class can be treated differently in order to differentiate the service implied for the data generator or consumer. Typical uses Packets are classified to be differently processed by the network scheduler. Upon classifying a traffic flow using a particular protocol, a predetermined policy can be applied to it and other flows to either guarantee a certain quality (as with VoIP or media streaming serviceSIN 450 Issue 1.2 May 2007 Suppliers' Information Note For The BT Network BT Wholesale - BT IPstream Advanced Services - End User Speed Control and Downstream Quality of Service - Service Description) or to provide best-effort delivery. This may be applied at the ingress point (the point at which traffic enters the network) with a granularity that allows traffic management mechanisms to separate traffic into individual flows and queue, police and shape them differently.Ferguson P., Huston G., Quality of Service: Delivering QoS on the Internet and in Corporate Networks, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1998. . Classification methods Classification is achieved by various means. Port numbers * Fast * Low resource-consuming * Supported by many network devices * Does not implement the application-layer payload, so it does not compromise the users' privacy * Useful only for the applications and services, which use fixed port numbers * Easy to cheat by changing the port number in the system Deep Packet Inspection * Inspects the actual payload of the packet * Detects the applications and services regardless of the port number, on which they operate * Slow * Requires a lot of processing power * Signatures must be kept up to date, as the applications change very frequently * Encryption makes this method impossible in many cases Matching bit patterns of data to those of known protocols is a simple widely used technique. An example to match the BitTorrent protocol handshaking phase would be a check to see if a packet began with character 19 which was then followed by the 19-byte string 'BitTorrent protocol'.BitTorrent Protocol A comprehensive comparison of various network traffic classifiers, which depend on Deep Packet Inspection (PACE, OpenDPI, 4 different configurations of L7-filter, NDPI, Libprotoident, and Cisco NBAR), is shown in the Independent Comparison of Popular DPI Tools for Traffic Classification. Statistical classification * Relies on statistical analysis of attributes such as byte frequencies, packet sizes and packet inter-arrival times.E. Hjelmvik and W. John, ‚ÄúStatistical Protocol IDentification with SPID: Preliminary Results‚Äù, in Proceedings of SNCNW, 2009 * Very often uses Machine Learning Algorithms, as K-Means, Naive Bayes Filter, C4.5, C5.0, J48, or Random Forest * Fast technique (compared to deep packet inspection classification) * It can detect the class of yet unknown applications Implementation Both, the Linux network scheduler and Netfilter contain logic to identify and mark or classify network packets. Typical traffic classes Operators often distinguish three broad types of network traffic: Sensitive, Best-Effort, and Undesired. Sensitive traffic Sensitive traffic is traffic the operator has an expectation to deliver on time. This includes VoIP, online gaming, video conferencing, and web browsing. Traffic management schemes are typically tailored in such a way that the quality of service of these selected uses is guaranteed, or at least prioritized over other classes of traffic. This can be accomplished by the absence of shaping for this traffic class, or by prioritizing sensitive traffic above other classes. Best-effort traffic Best effort traffic is all other kinds of non-detrimental traffic. This is traffic that the ISP deems isn't sensitive to Quality of Service metrics (jitter, packet loss, latency). A typical example would be peer-to-peer and email applications.The spam problem has actually led some network operators to implement Traffic shaping on SMTP traffic. See Tarpit (networking) Traffic management schemes are generally tailored so best-effort traffic gets what is left after sensitive traffic. Undesired traffic This category is generally limited to the delivery of spam and traffic created by worms, botnets, and other malicious attacks. In some networks, this definition can include such traffic as non- local VoIP (for example, Skype) or video streaming services to protect the market for the 'in-house' services of the same type. In these cases, traffic classification mechanisms identify this traffic, allowing the network operator to either block this traffic entirely, or severely hamper its operation. File sharing Peer-to-peer file sharing applications are often designed to use any and all available bandwidth which impacts QoS-sensitive applications (like online gaming) that use comparatively small amounts of bandwidth. P2P programs can also suffer from download strategy inefficiencies, namely downloading files from any available peer, regardless of link cost. The applications use ICMP and regular HTTP traffic to discover servers and download directories of available files. In 2002, Sandvine Incorporated determined, through traffic analysis, that P2P traffic accounted for up to 60% of traffic on most networks. The Register article which refers to Sandvine report - access to the actual report requires registration with Sandvine This shows, in contrast to previous studies and forecasts, that P2P has become mainstream. P2P protocols can and are often designed so that the resulting packets are harder to identify (to avoid detection by traffic classifiers), and with enough robustness that they do not depend on specific QoS properties in the network (in-order packet delivery, jitter, etc. - typically this is achieved through increased buffering and reliable transport, with the user experiencing increased download time as a result). The encrypted BitTorrent protocol does for example rely on obfuscation and randomized packet sizes in order to avoid identification.Identifying the Message Stream Encryption (MSE) protocol File sharing traffic can be appropriately classified as Best-Effort traffic. At peak times when sensitive traffic is at its height, download speeds will decrease. However, since P2P downloads are often background activities, it affects the subscriber experience little, so long as the download speeds increase to their full potential when all other subscribers hang up their VoIP phones. Exceptions are real-time P2P VoIP and P2P video streaming services who need permanent QoS and use excessive overhead and parity traffic to enforce this as far as possible. Some P2P applications Example for client side P2P traffic limiting can be configured to act as self- limiting sources, serving as a traffic shaper configured to the user's (as opposed to the network operator's) traffic specification. Some vendors advocate managing clients rather than specific protocols, particularly for ISPs. By managing per-client (that is, per customer), if the client chooses to use their fair share of the bandwidth running P2P applications, they can do so, but if their application is abusive, they only clog their own bandwidth and cannot affect the bandwidth used by other customers.

He gave up the highest percentage of hard hit balls of all major league pitchers, at 56.4%. Pitching style Jones is a hard thrower with four pitches in his repertoire. His main pitch is a two-seam fastball at 96‚Äì99. He also throws a slider and changeup (84‚Äì88), and a rare curveball.

His father Henryk Glicenstein was a sculptor and he was living in Rome with his wife Helena (born Hirszenberg) when Emanuel was born. His father obtained Italian citizenship and adopted the name Enrico. Emanuel was brought up in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, England and Poland. in 1926 Emanuel and his father sailed for New York. They briefly visited Chicago. Glicenstein's sister, Beatrice, and mother joined them in New York years later. Romano changed his name when he was in America and some have erroneously thought this was to avoid Jewish discrimination. However Romano changed his name in order that he could create his own success and to avoid being accused of exploiting his father's fame. In 1936 Romano was working for the Federal Art Project creating murals (see picture).Emanuel Glicen Romano, Archives of American Art. Retrieved 27 December 2011 During and immediately after World War II, Romano created a series of allegorical works depicting graphic holocaust images that were held closely by the family after his passing.

The case The original case decided by the MSPB involved seven employees and four different United States Government employers.In addition to Douglas, the other employees were Joseph E. Cicero (also a Veterans Administration employee), Douglas C. Jackson and James K. Anderson (civilian employees of the Department of the Air Force), Luis A. Jimenez (a civilian employee of the Department of the Army), and John Nocifore and John Dennis (civilian employees of the Department of the Navy). All seven employees were terminated by their respective employers for \\"job-related misconduct under 5 U.S.C. 7513\\".Douglas was terminated for being absent without leave, being away from his duty station without authorization, and selling his employment services to a fellow employee. Cicero was terminated for failure to comply with supervisory direction. Jackson was terminated for misrepresenting that he was enrolled in a night college class to obtain a day shift assignment. Anderson was terminated for failure to request leave due to chronic foot problems. Jimenez was terminated for unauthorized use of a government vehicle. Nocifore and Dennis were terminated for theft of government property. All but one employee appealed to the MSPB on the grounds that the punishment was too severe.Cicero argued that the work he was accused of not performing had been performed by another employee before he could get to it. Initially, the MSPB's presiding officials sided with the employers on the grounds that selection of a penalty was a matter of agency discretion. However, the MSPB reopened the case, and requested comments via the Federal Register as to whether 1) the preponderance of the evidence standard was the appropriate standard to determine whether an agency-imposed sanction should be sustained, and 2) whether the MSPB had the authority to modify a punishment if it determined \\"the penalty does not promote the efficiency of the service\\". In its opinion the MSPB made the following determinations: #In a jurisdictional matter, the MSPB ruled that, as the successor to the Civil Service Commission, it had the same authority to mitigate penalties as the Commission previously held. #The MSPB ruled that agencies had the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the punishment fit the circumstances. In doing so, the MSPB outlined a non- exhaustive list of factors, which may be aggravating and/or mitigating depending on the circumstances (commonly referred to as \\"Douglas factors\\", see below) that agencies were to consider. #The MSPB upheld the terminations for five of the seven employees.The terminations of Douglas, Cicero, Jackson, Nocifore, and Dennis were upheld. Anderson's termination was vacated and reduced by the MSPB to a 30-day suspension; Jimenez's termination was vacated and remanded to the MSPB's New York Field Office for further findings. The Douglas Factors #The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated; #the employee's job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position; #the employee's past disciplinary record; #the employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability; #the effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors‚Äô confidence in the employee's work ability to perform assigned duties; #consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses; #consistency of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties; #the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency; #the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question; #the potential for the employee's rehabilitation; #mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter; and #the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others. The Douglas factors are critical to a determination of the disciplinary penalty to be issued in a federal employee's case and are used to argue that disciplinary charges for federal employees, even if true, should still result in a lower penalty than the one proposed. Moreover, the MSPB has consistently held that when deciding officials fail to fully consider all the relevant Douglas Factors their penalty determination is not entitled to deference. Accordingly, the Douglas Factors are a critical point of analysis in any federal employee's discipline case, both for management and the employee.

The World Health Organization (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spiritual health. Having a religious belief may have both positive and negative impacts on health and morbidity. Religion and spirituality Spirituality has been ascribed many different definitions in different contexts, but a general definition is: an individual's search for meaning and purpose in life. Spirituality is distinct from organized religion in that spirituality does not necessarily need a religious framework. That is, one does not necessarily need to follow certain rules, guidelines or practices to be spiritual, but an organized religion often has some combination of these in place. Some people who suffer from severe mental disorders may find comfort in religion. People who report themselves to be spiritual people may not observe any specific religious practices or traditions.Nelson, C.J., Rosenfeld, B., Breitbart, W., Galietta, M. (2002). Spirituality, religion, and depression in the terminally ill 43. Psychosomatics. pp. 213‚Äì220. Scientific research More than 3000 empirical studies have examined relationships between religion and health, including more than 1200 in the 20th century, and more than 2000 additional studies between 2000 and 2009. Various other reviews of the religion/spirituality and health literature have been published. These include two reviews from an NIH-organized expert panel that appeared in a 4-article special section of American Psychologist. Several chapters in edited academic books have also reviewed the empirical literature.Doug Oman & Carl E. Thoresen (2005), \\"Do religion and spirituality influence health?\\" In: The literature has also been reviewed extensively from the perspective of public health and its various subfields ranging from health policy and management to infectious diseases and vaccinology. More than 30 meta-analyses and 100 systematic reviews have been published on relations between religious or spiritual factors and health outcomes. Dimensions of health The World Health Organization (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spiritual health. Physical health =Positive effects= According to Ellison & Levin (1998), some studies indicate that religiosity appears to positively correlate with physical health. For instance, mortality rates are lower among people who frequently attend religious events and consider themselves both religious and spiritual. According to Seybold & Hill (2001), almost all studies involved in the effect of religion on a person's physical health have revealed it has a positive attribution to their lifestyle. These studies have been carried out among all ages,genders and religions. These are based on the experience of religion is positive in itself. One possibility is that religion provides physical health benefits indirectly. Church attendees present with lower rates of alcohol consumption and improvement in mood, which is associated with better physical health. Kenneth Pargament is a major contributor to the theory of how individuals may use religion as a resource in coping with stress, His work seems to show the influence of attribution theory. Additional evidence suggests that this relationship between religion and physical health may be causal. Religion may reduce likelihood of certain diseases. Studies suggest that it guards against cardiovascular disease by reducing blood pressure, and also improves immune system functioning. Similar studies have been done investigating religious emotions and health. Although religious emotions, such as humility, forgiveness, and gratitude confer health benefits, it is unclear if religious people cultivate and experience those emotions more frequently than non-religious peoples. =Church attendance= In many studies, attendance at religious services has been found to be associated with lower levels of multiple risk factors for ill health and mortality and with lower prevalence and incidence of illness and mortality. For example, a recent report of a follow-up study of over five thousand Americans found those attending more than weekly had half the mortality of those never attending after adjusting for multiple variables. This can be expressed as an increase life expectancy (Hummer et al. 1999) with a life expectancy at age 20 of 83 years for frequent attendees and 75 years for non-attendees. A causal association between a risk factor and an outcome can only be proven by a randomized controlled experiment, obviously infeasible in this case. Hence, observational findings of an association of religious attendance with lower mortality are compatible with a causal relationship but cannot prove one. Church goers may differ from others in ways not measured that could explain their better health. =Death rates= Kark et. (1996) included almost 4,000 Israelis, over 16 years (beginning in 1970), death rates were compared between the experimental group (people belonging to 11 religious kibbutzim) versus the control group (people belonging to secular kibbutzim). Some determining factors for the groups included the date the kibbutz was created, geography of the different groups, and the similarity in age. It was determined that ‚Äúbelonging to a religious collective was associated with a strong protective effect\\". Not only do religious people tend to exhibit healthier lifestyles, they also have a strong support system that secular people would not normally have. A religious community can provide support especially through a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people. The existence of ‚Äòreligious struggle‚Äô in elderly patients was predictive of greater risk of mortality in a study by Pargament et al. (2001). Results indicate that patients, with a previously sound religious life, experienced a 19% to 28% greater mortality due to the belief that God was supposedly punishing them or abandoning them. =Infections= A number of religious practices have been reported to cause infections. These happened during an ultra-orthodox Jewish circumcisions practice known as metzitzah b'peh, the ritual 'side roll' in Hinduism,The ‚Äòside roll‚Äô is a ritual performed during a Hindu festival in which large numbers of male devotees lie prostrate on the ground and roll sideways around the temple premises in fulfilment of vows taken at the temple. Because the men‚Äôs upper bodies are usually bare during this ritual, their skin comes into contact with the parasitic larvae that infest the soil or sand on the ground, resulting in the Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) skin disease. the Christian communion chalice, during the Islamic Hajj and after the Muslim ritual ablution. =Prayer= Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for. Meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is \\"no discernible effect\\" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had \\"small, but significant, effect sizes\\" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings. Randomized controlled trials of intercessory prayer have not yielded significant effects on health. These trials have compared personal, focused, committed and organized intercessory prayer with those interceding holding some belief that they are praying to God or a god versus any other intervention. A Cochrane collaboration review of these trials concluded that 1) results were equivocal, 2) evidence does not support a recommendation either in favor or against the use of intercessory prayer and 3) any resources available for future trials should be used to investigate other questions in health research. In a case-control study done following 5,286 Californians over a 28-year period in which variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period. However, this can be partly be attributed to a better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet. Mental health Evidence suggests that religiosity can be a pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, religiosity is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control. Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz found negative correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression. Religiosity has been found to mitigate the negative impact of injustice and income inequality on life satisfaction. The link between religion and mental health may be due to the guiding framework or social support that it offers to individuals. By these routes, religion has the potential to offer security and significance in life, as well as valuable human relationships, to foster mental health. Some theorists have suggested that the benefits of religion and religiosity are accounted for by the social support afforded by membership in a religious group. Religion may also provide coping skills to deal with stressors, or demands perceived as straining. Pargament's three primary styles of religious coping are 1) self-directing, characterized by self-reliance and acknowledgement of God, 2) deferring, in which a person passively attributes responsibility to God, and 3) collaborative, which involves an active partnership between the individual and God and is most commonly associated with positive adjustment. This model of religious coping has been criticized for its over-simplicity and failure to take into account other factors, such as level of religiosity, specific religion, and type of stressor. Additional work by Pargament involves a detailed delineation of positive and negative forms of religious coping, captured in the BRIEF-RCOPE questionnaire which have been linked to a range of positive and negative psychological outcomes. =Depression= Studies have shown a negative relationship between spiritual well-being and depressive symptoms. In one study, those who were assessed to have a higher spiritual quality of life on a spiritual well-being scale had less depressive symptoms.Fehring, R.J., Miller, J.F., Shaw, C. (1997). Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer 24. Oncology Nursing Forum. pp. 663‚Äì671. Cancer and AIDS patients who were more spiritual had lower depressive symptoms than religious patients. Spirituality shows beneficial effects possibly because it speaks to one's ability to intrinsically find meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, which is especially important for very ill patients. Exline et al. 1999 showed that the difficulty in forgiving God and alienation from God were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Among those who currently believed in God, forgiving God for a specific, unfortunate incident predicted lower levels of anxious and depressed mood. =Schizophrenia and psychosis= Studies have reported beneficial effects of spirituality on the lives of patients with schizophrenia, major depression, and other psychotic disorders. Schizophrenic patients were less likely to be re-hospitalized if families encouraged religious practice, and in depressed patients who underwent religiously based interventions, their symptoms improved faster than those who underwent secular interventions. Furthermore, a few cross-sectional studies have shown that more religiously involved people had less instance of psychosis.Koenig, H. G. (2008) Research on religion, spirituality, and mental health: A review. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. =Life satisfaction= Research shows that religiosity moderates the relationship between ‚Äúthinking about meaning of life‚Äù and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking about the meaning of life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive. Religiosity has also been found to moderate the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals. =Coping with trauma= One of the most common ways that people cope with trauma is through the comfort found in religious or spiritual practices.Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press. Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style. Leading researchers have split religious coping into two categories: positive religious coping and negative religious coping. Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or spiritual struggles) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith. The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a defence mechanism as it was viewed by Sigmund Freud. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens. Moral mandate Social health Spiritual health Spiritual Health is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.

Retrieved 22 December 2011. Early life His education at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1862 to 1867 was followed by additional instruction under P. C. Skovgaard and Vilhelm Kyhn who was particularly successful in communicating a grandiose style which allowed Zacho to benefit from new artistic trends. When he was 30, he went to Italy with Anton Thiele, Otto Haslund and Christian Blanche, visiting the Vienna World Exposition on his return in 1873. He was particularly impressed by the French landscape painters, especially those from the Barbizon school, whose work he saw in Vienna. He spent a year with L√©on Bonnat in Paris (1875‚Äì76) together with Godfred Christensen and William Groth, creating interest for French art and culture in Denmark. Together with P. S. Kr√∏yer, he spent a summer in Brittany. Career Christian Zacho: Winter Scene in Brittany; First Snow (1881) Zacho began to exhibit at Charlottenborg as early as 1865 with En Septemberdag (A September Day) painted in Jutland like most of his earlier works. Later landscapes were of Zealand, M√∏n and Bornholm. Some of his most successful works are those of woods in the springtime where streams run under tree tops bathed in sunlight. Two of his most appreciated works are his painting of Vinterbillede fra Bretagne, Den f√∏rste Sne (The First Snow, 1881) and Et stille Vand i Dyrehaven (Quiet Waters in the Dyrhave, 1884).\\"Zacho, Peter M√∏rch Christian\\", Dansk biografisk lexikon. Retrieved 22 December 2011. His works can only be described as talented. From a historical viewpoint, his paintings from France, executed with a well-developed technique and a strong sense of colour, are important as they give us a better understanding of the painters who followed in his footsteps. A good example is Vinterbillede fra Bretagne (Winter Scene from Brittany), 1881). Zacho continued to follow the style of the older generation of French landscape painters, especially Th√©odore Rousseau. There is no sign of Impressionism in his work as can be seen from his paintings of Brittany. Taken as a whole, he work can be said to fall in the Danish landscape tradition. His paintings of Bornholm and Zealand are delicately conceived but are a little conservative. In later life, he also painted portraits. He is however remembered above all for his more traditional, idyllic works which often depicted scenes of Danish beech woods.

Biography Early years Eric Fisher Wood was born in New York City in 1888 to Frances Fisher Wood (1852-1958) and Dr. William Benjamin Wood. As a boy Wood was educated in private schools.\\"Eric Fisher Wood Papers: Biographical History,\\" Special Collections Research Center, Syracuse University Library, Syracuse, New York, May 1967. He later enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, from which he graduated with degrees in Economics, English, and a PhD degree in civil engineering. Wood did additional post-graduate course work studying architecture at Columbia University in New York City, as well as the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Activity during World War I At the time of the eruption of World War I, Wood was an American in Paris. Wood volunteered his services at the American Embassy in France as an attach√©, joining the Embassy staff to help handle the greatly increased workload that was associated with the war. Later Wood would join the American Ambulance Corps, serving in that capacity for a few months.Thomas A. Rumer, The American Legion: An Official History, 1919-1989. New York: M. Evans & Co., 1990; pg. 104. Wood maintained a journal during his time in Europe which he published in book form in 1915 as The Note-book of an Attach√©: Seven Months in the War Zone. Wood subsequently returned to the United States, where he became Vice-President of the National Security League, an organization dedicated to fostering so-called \\"military preparedness\\" in the face of the vast and spreading European War. Wood was also involved from a year from 1915 to 1916 as part of the Plattsburgh Training Camp Executive Committee. He found time to publish a second book during this interval dealing with the topic of military preparedness, The Writing on the Wall. In 1917 Wood returned to Europe, where he served in the British Army with the rank of major. In this capacity he was wounded at Arras on April 9, 1917. In 1917, as an officer at Camp Sherman, Ohio, he was sent out to raise building funds by Major General Edwin Forbes Glenn, who was responsible for organizing the 83rd Infantry Division. Follow American entry into the war in 1917, Wood was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army on August 14, 1917 and served as assistant chief of staff for the 88th Infantry Division. Wood was wounded again, this time by poison gas during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive that same fall. By the end of the hostilities in November 1918 Wood had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel.Marquis James, A History of the American Legion. New York: William Green, 1923; pg. 17. Founding the American Legion On February 15, 1919, Wood was ordered by Gen. John J. Pershing to join with 19 of his fellows in a special committee headed by Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. given the task of providing a set of recommendations aimed at curbing the serious problem of declining morale.James, A History of the American Legion, pg. 16. A series of proposals resulted from the day-long session, including elimination of restrictive regulations, organization of additional athletic events and recreational opportunities, and the expansion of leave time and entertainment programs.James, A History of the American Legion, pp. 16-17. Lt. Col. Roosevelt had an additional purpose unbeknownst to Wood, however, and in the evening the group retired to an Allied Officers Club, where the eldest son of the former President unveiled his proposal for a new veterans' society ‚Äî a group which would ultimately emerge as the American Legion.James, A History of the American Legion, pp. 17-18. A provisional executive committee of four people emerged from the February 15 \\"Roosevelt dinner\\", headed by Roosevelt himself, who was to return to the United States and obtain his military discharge when able, and then to gather assistants and promote the idea of the new veterans' organization among demobilized troops there.James, A History of the American Legion, pg. 20. Roosevelt's close associate in the project George A. White, who was to travel France touring the camps of the AEF explaining the idea in person. The European center of operations was to be manned by Wood, together with former Ohio Congressman Ralph D. Cole. The pair were to establish a central office and to maintain contact by mail and telegram with the various combat divisions and headquarters staffs, as well as to publicize activities to the press. Wood also served as the first temporary chairman of the April 1919 Paris Caucus of the American Legion, as well as the Secretary of the two subsequent gatherings which formally established the organization, the St. Louis Caucus and the Minneapolis National Convention.Rumer, The American Legion, pp. 104-105. Interwar career The Warren G. Harding Memorial, better known as the \\"Harding Tomb\\", was co-designed by Eric Fisher Wood. During the 1920s Wood moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he established himself as a prominent architect. He also continued his military career as commander of the Pennsylvania National Guard. With the outbreak of World War II, Wood was recalled to active duty. He served for the duration of the war, rising to the rank of brigadier general. During the course of his military career Wood would earn the Legion of Merit, the Purple Heart with oak leaf, and the Croix de guerre, in addition to 20 ribbons and 10 battle stars.Rumer, The American Legion, pg. 105.

Meteorological history  Typhoon Cora, which began its life on August 30, attained peak winds of 175 mph on September 5. It passed near Okinawa, causing major damage to the infrastructure on the island, but no loss of life. Cora continued to the northwest, hit northeastern China as a super typhoon on the 7th, and turned northeast to become extratropical near South Korea on the 9th.  Impact  Typhoon Cora (September 4) Slowly moving by the southern Ryukyu Islands, Cora battered the region for more than 30 hours. Miyako-jima suffered the brunt of the typhoon's impact; sustained winds on the island reached 219 km/h (136 mph) while gusts peaked at 307 km/h (191 mph). This placed Cora as a greater than 1-in-100 year event in the region. Winds of least 144 km/h (89 mph) battered Miyako-jima for 13 continuous hours. Of the 11,060 homes on Miyako-jima, 1,943 were destroyed and a further 3,249 severely damaged. The majority of these were wooden structures whose structures were compromised once their roof was torn off. Steel structures also sustained considerable damage while reinforced concrete buildings fared the best. The resulting effects rendered 6,000 residents homeless. The scale of damage varied across the island with Ueno- mura suffering the most extensive losses. Of the community's 821 homes, 90.1 percent was severely damaged or destroyed. A United States Air Force radar station was destroyed on the island. On nearby Ishigaki Island, where wind gusts reached 162 km/h (101 mph), 71 homes were destroyed while a further 139 were severely damaged. Total losses from Cora in the region reached $30 million. Despite the severity of damage, no fatalities took place and only five injuries were reported. Wind gusts up to 130 km/h (80 mph) caused notable damage in Taiwan, with 17 homes destroyed and 42 more damaged. A smaller island closer to the storm reported a peak gust of 226 km/h (140 mph). Heavy rains were generally confined to northern areas of the island, peaking at 405 mm (15.9 in). Three people were killed during Cora's passage while seventeen others sustained injury. Additionally, 5,000 persons were evacuated. Damage amounted to NT$4.2 million. Striking Fujian Province, China, on the heels of Typhoon Alice, Cora exacerbated damage in the region. Property damage was extreme with more than 21,000 homes destroyed and nearly 63,000 more damage. An estimated 265,000 people were severely affected by the storm. A total of 269 people perished during the storm while a further 2,918 were injured; 52 people were also listed missing. Tremendous flooding occurred as a result of the rains from Alice and Cora, damaging 190,000 hectares (469,000 acres) of crops which resulted in a loss of 195,000 kg (430,000 lb) in food production.

In the 1966 paper, Leeson stated correctly that \\" is the signal level at the oscillator active element input\\" (often referred to as the power through the resonator now, strictly speaking it is the available power at the amplifier input). F is the device noise factor, however this does need to be measured at the operating power level. The common misunderstanding, that is the oscillator output level, may result from derivations that are not completely general. In 1982, W. P. Robins (IEEE Publication \\"Phase noise in signal sources\\") correctly showed that the Leeson equation (in the -20dB/decade region) is not just an empirical rule, but a result that follows from a linear analysis of an oscillator circuit. However, a used constraint in his circuit was that the oscillator output power was approximately equal to the active device input power. The Leeson equation is presented in various forms. In the above equation, if is set to zero the equation represents a linear analysis of a feedback oscillator in the general case (and flicker noise is not included), it is for this that Leeson is most recognised, showing a -20dB/ decade of offset frequency slope. If used correctly, the Leeson equation gives a useful prediction of oscillator performance in this range. If a value for is included, the equation also shows a curve fit for the flicker noise. The for an amplifier depends on the actual configuration used, because radio-frequency and low-frequency negative feedback can have an effect on . So for accurate results, must be determined from added noise measurements on the amplifier using R.F., with the actual circuit configuration to be used in the oscillator.

It was first founded in 1926. Amateur theatre companies in Scotland have generally presented repertoire in English, Lowland Scots and, more occasionally, Scottish Gaelic. The SCDA was founded during the period of the Scottish Renaissance, a time of increasing calls to revive many of the cultural and political institutions in Scotland which were perceived as moribund at this period, including native theatre. Serious professional theatre in Scotland had more or less lapsed by the 1880s and the first twentieth century attempt to revive it faltered with the demise of Alfred Wareing's short-lived Glasgow Repertory Theatre (founded in 1909) which closed down on the outbreak of World War I. Its remaining funds were used in the early 1920s to found the amateur Scottish National Players with the goal to promote native theatre. During the interwar years all such initiatives had their origins in the amateur theatre movement, in particular Glasgow's Curtain Theatre (1932‚Äì39) founded by Grace Ballantyne, Scottish People's Theatre and Glasgow Unity. No teaching institutions offered formal provision for training in Scottish styles of performance or diction until the establishment of the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art in 1950 (as part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music). as a consequence, most of Scotland's ground- breaking mid-twentieth century native actors, such as Duncan Macrae, Roddy McMillan or Molly Urquhart, first developed their skills and methods through performance with the more innovative non-professional companies listed above. Similarly, native playwrights who wished to present authentic representations of Scottish life on the stage, such as Joe Corrie, Robert McLellan, John Brandane, Ena Lamont Stewart and others, first came to attention generally through amateur productions of their plays. Lowland Scots playwrights in particular were well served by non-professional theatre at a time when voicing for professional actors in Britain was dictated by received pronunciation. Miscasting in professional productions of McLellan's Scots plays was a regular complaint for the playwright, often in contrast to amateur productions of his Scots in which actors without formal training gave sympathetic and authentic delivery of the language. After James Bridie's establishment of the Citizens Theatre in 1942, Scotland finally began to develop a native professional theatre. After the introduction of television during the 1950s, the number of amateur companies in Scotland, in common with the situation elsewhere, began to decline from its peak in the 1940s, but it still remains a vigorous part of Scottish cultural life. The SCDA has maintained a successful annual one-act drama festival since its inception, with one interregnum of five years (1940‚Äì45) during the Second World War.

The 2003 Wealden District Council election took place on 1 May 2003 to elect members of Wealden District Council in East Sussex, England. The whole council was up for election with boundary changes since the last election in 1999 reducing the number of seats by 3. The Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Background At the last election in 1999 the Conservatives won 34 seats, compared to 22 for the Liberal Democrats and 2 independents. In November 2003 the Conservatives gained 2 seats from the Liberal Democrats in a by-election in Uckfield, but the Liberal Democrats took one seat back in the same ward in a June 2002 by-election. The Liberal Democrats also lost seats after 2 Hailsham councillors, Nick and Madeline Ellwood, were expelled from the party, and a further 2, John Glover and Ian Haffenden, resigned from the party in protest. The 4 councillors who resigned formed a Wealden Independents party, while the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the council, Allan Thurley, stepped down over the expulsions and was succeeded by Eddie Rice. A total of 133 candidates stood for the 55 seats in 35 wards being contested, after boundary changes reduced the number of seats from 58. The changes increased the number of seats in Crowborough and Uckfield, while combining some of the rural seats. Campaign A major issue at the election was council tax after it increased by 18%, 5.1% of which was due to Wealden Council. The Conservatives blamed the increase on the government providing a poor grant to the council, while the Liberal Democrats called for the council tax to be replaced by a local income tax. Another issue was housing with the Conservatives called for more land to be released for low cost housing, but the Liberal Democrats attacked the number of houses to be built, saying the infrastructure needed to be improved first. Both the Labour party and local independents also campaigned against the 1,300 houses to be built in Hailsham, with The Independents saying more houses should be built in the north of the council area. The Conservatives said they would tackle littering and continue the household recycling scheme, while the Liberal Democrats called for policing to be improved and for the council to be modernised. Meanwhile, Labour aimed to win their first seat on the council in Uckfield and called for the council to abolish the reduction in council tax for second homes. Election result The Conservatives stayed in control of the council with 34 seats, while the Liberal Democrats took 15 seats and independents won 6. Few seats changed parties, with the Conservatives keeping a 13-seat majority. The changes that did happen included the Liberal Democrat group leader Eddie Rice losing his seat in Rotherfield and the Liberal Democrats were also defeated in Polegate South, where Ivy Scarborough, a Residents Association candidate was successful. Independents were also successful in Crowborough and Hailsham, while Labour failed to take any seats. Overall turnout at the election was 35%, up from 33.5% in 1999. 3 Conservative candidates were unopposed at the election. Ward results By-elections between 2003 and 2007 Uckfield Ridgewood A by-election was held in Uckfield Ridgewood on 16 September 2004 and was held for the Liberal Democrats by Robert Sweetland with a 185-vote majority. Pevensey and Westham A by- election was held in Pevensey and Westham on 29 September 2005 after the death of the previous councillor John Vincent. The seat was held for the Conservatives by Kevin Balsdon with a 760-vote majority. Crowborough North A by-election was held in Crowoborough North on 6 April 2006 and was held for the Conservatives by Timothy Tyler with a 279-vote majority. Uckfield New Town A by-election was held in Uckfield New Town on 29 June 2006 after the death of the Liberal Democrat councillor Ian Nottage.

Mycale is a large genus and this species is placed in the subgenus Mycale making its full name, Mycale (Mycale) grandis. Description Mycale grandis is a bright orange colour both outside and inside. It forms encrusting masses which can reach across and thick. The consistency is compressible but firm and fibrous and the sponge can be torn. The surface is smooth and undulating. There are a few large openings called oscula and a greater number of smaller openings called ostia. Water is drawn in through the oscula and expelled through the ostia after having had minute food particles removed by specialised cells. The inside of the sponge is hollow and often contains small brittle stars.Mycale grandis Global Invasive Species Database. Retrieved 2011-12-22.Mycale grandis NOAA factsheet. Retrieved 2011-12-22. Distribution and habitat The native range of Mycale grandis is Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and India. It has spread to Mexico and to Hawaii where it is considered an invasive species. It is part of the fouling community and is found on man made structures such as harbour walls, wharves and pilings and in disturbed habitats such as freshly dredged channels and lagoons. Invasiveness In Hawaii, Mycale grandis was first reported from Pearl Harbor in 1996. Since then it has moved out of its normal habitats and is also found on reef slopes in KƒÅne'ohe Bay where it is overgrowing and suppressing native coral species such as Montipora capitata and Porites compressa. A study that took place from 2004 onwards found that it was spreading to further sites. Attempts were made to remove the sponges mechanically but the results were equivocal; regrowth of the sponges occurred and the corals were damaged inadvertently. Further trials included the injection of compressed air into the sponges. This proved more successful.

It lies about 400 metres north of Nardevitz, a village in the parish of Lohme on the island of R√ºgen. Surrounded by trees and bushes as well as other drift material that was in the way of farming, it lies in the middle of a field. Its volume is estimated at 104 m¬≥, which gives it a mass of 281 tonnes. The above- ground portion has a volume of 71 m¬≥. It is therefore, apart from Buskam which lies in the Baltic Sea off G√∂hren, the largest erratic on R√ºgen and an important geological sight. Because the Nardevitz Erratic was used for a long time to obtain construction material, it is suspected today that it was once three times its present size. For example, in 1854 and 1855, column drums weighing about five tonne and pedestal blocks, up to 2 tonnes in weight, for the Prussian Columns near Neukamp and Gro√ü Stresow were hewn from the rock. On the rock itself there are clear traces that show there were plans for further destruction of the erratic. Today the Nardevitz Rock, like around 20 other erratics on the island of R√ºgen, is one of its legally-protected geotopes. It is recorded in the relevant register at the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern State Office for the Environment, Conservation and Geology (Landesamt f√ºr Umwelt, Naturschutz und Geologie Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) as entry \\"G2 75\\".

During the crossing the personnel was protected behind the vessel's steel hull and a massive ramp at the bow. The vessel was built with a flat bottom so it could run well into shallow beaches without run aground. When the vessel had run as close to land as possible, the ramp went rapidly down and the personnel stormed ashore, if necessary by use of fire and movement.

Lake Mutanda discharges from its south-west corner through the Kako River and the Tshengere Swamp into the Rutshuru. At one time, what is now Lake Kivu was in the watershed of the Rutshuru River. Volcanic eruptions at the end of the Pliocene epoch created the Virunga Mountains, blocking off this part of the drainage basin.

The series chronicles behind-the- scenes events at the fictional Atlantis Cable News (ACN) channel. It features an ensemble cast including Jeff Daniels as anchor Will McAvoy who, together with his staff, sets out to put on a news show \\"in the face of corporate and commercial obstacles and their own personal entanglements\\". Other cast members include Emily Mortimer, John Gallagher Jr., Alison Pill, Thomas Sadoski, Dev Patel, Olivia Munn, and Sam Waterston. Sorkin, who created the Emmy Award- winning political drama The West Wing, had reportedly been developing a cable- news-centered TV drama since 2009. After months of negotiations, premium cable network HBO ordered a pilot in January 2011 and then a full series in September that year. Sorkin did his research for the series by observing several real-world cable news programs first-hand. He served as executive producer, along with Scott Rudin and Alan Poul. Series overview The 25-episode series is set behind the scenes at the fictional Atlantis Cable News (ACN) and revolves around anchor Will McAvoy, his new executive producer MacKenzie McHale, newsroom staff Jim Harper, Maggie Jordan, Sloan Sabbith, Neal Sampat, Don Keefer, and the head of ACN, Charlie Skinner.

Production Development Entertainment Weekly reported in April 2009 that Sorkin, while still working on the screenplay for The Social Network, was contemplating a new TV drama about the behind-the-scenes events at a cable news program. Sorkin was the series creator of Sports Night and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, both shows depicting the off-camera happenings of fictional television programs. Talks were reportedly ongoing between Sorkin and HBO since 2010. In January 2011, Sorkin revealed the project on BBC News. To research the cable news world, Sorkin had been an off-camera guest at MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann in 2010 to observe the show's production and quizzed Parker Spitzers staff when he was a guest on that show. He also spent time shadowing Hardball with Chris Matthews as well as other programs on Fox News and CNN. Sorkin told TV Guide that he intended to take a less cynical view of the media: \\"They're going to be trying to do well in a context where it's very difficult to do well when there are commercial concerns and political concerns and corporate concerns.\\" Sorkin decided that rather than have his characters react to fictional news events as on his earlier series, The Newsroom would be set in the recent past and track real-world stories largely as they unfolded, to give a greater sense of realism. HBO ordered a pilot in January 2011 with the working title More as This Story Develops. The Social Network Scott Rudin signed on as executive producer. Rudin's only previous television work was the 1996 spin-off series Clueless. By June, Jeff Daniels, Emily Mortimer, Sam Waterston, Olivia Munn, and Dev Patel were cast, while Greg Mottola had signed on to direct the pilot. The pilot script was later reportedly obtained by several news outlets. On September 8, 2011, HBO ordered a full series starting with an initial 10-episode run with a premiere date set for summer 2012. A day after the second episode aired, HBO renewed the series for a second season. Sorkin said in June 2012 that The Newsroom \\"is meant to be an idealistic, romantic, swashbuckling, sometimes comedic but very optimistic, upward-looking look at a group of people who are often looked at cynically. The same as with The West Wing, where ordinarily in popular culture our leaders are portrayed either as Machiavellian or dumb; I wanted to do something different and show a highly competent group of people.\\" Series title While the pilot was in development, the project was tentatively titled More as This Story Develops. On November 29, 2011, HBO filed for a trademark on \\"The Newsroom\\" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The new name immediately drew comparisons with the Ken Finkleman-created Canadian comedy series of the same name that aired on CBC and public television stations in the U.S. The series' name was confirmed as The Newsroom in an HBO promo released on December 21, 2011, previewing its programs for 2012. Writing in Maclean's, Jaime Weinman said the choice of name was \\"a bit of a grimly amusing reminder that the U.S. TV industry doesn't take Canada very seriously ... The Newsroom is often considered the greatest show Canada has ever produced, but a U.S. network feels no need to fear unflattering comparisons: assuming they've heard of the show, they probably think most people in the States have not heard of it.\\" In an interview with The Daily Beast following the Sorkin show's premiere, Finkleman revealed that HBO did contact him for permission to reuse the title, which he granted. Casting Jeff Daniels was cast in the lead role in March 2011. Alison Pill and Olivia Munn reportedly entered negotiations to star in April 2011. The fictional executive producer role was initially offered to Marisa Tomei, but negotiations fell through. Tomei was replaced by Emily Mortimer in May 2011. Sam Waterston also joined the project in May. John Gallagher Jr., Thomas Sadoski, and Dev Patel were added to the cast in June 2011. New York magazine reported that Sorkin had planned for MSNBC host Chris Matthews and Andrew Breitbart to appear in a roundtable debate scene in the pilot; however, the idea was shot down by MSNBC purportedly because the network was displeased with the corporate culture portrayal of cable news and skewering of left-leaning media in the show's script. Chris Matthews' son, Thomas, joined the cast in the role of Martin Stallworth, an associate producer for the fictional show. Three months after the series was picked up, Jane Fonda signed on to play Leona Lansing, the CEO of the fictional network's parent company. Fonda was married to Turner Broadcasting System and CNN founder Ted Turner for 10 years. Lansing was touted by some observers as a female version of Fonda's ex-husband. The name \\"Leona Lansing\\" is taken from the names of two highly successful businesswomen, real estate developer Leona Helmsley and former Paramount Pictures CEO Sherry Lansing. Jon Tenney guest- starred as Wade, MacKenzie's boyfriend. Natalie Morales has a guest role as Kaylee, Neal's girlfriend. Terry Crews plays Lonny, Will's bodyguard. Rosemarie DeWitt was originally cast as Rebecca Halliday, a litigator who is tasked with defending ACN in a wrongful termination suit in the second season, but DeWitt had to vacate the role due to scheduling conflicts. The role was recast with Marcia Gay Harden. Patton Oswalt was announced to play Jonas Pfeiffer, the new V.P. of human resources at ACN, in November 2012, but he ultimately did not appear in the season. Filming The Newsrooms set is located in Sunset Gower Studios, Hollywood, on Stage 7. The fictional Atlantis World Media building, however, is actually the Bank of America Tower on Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan (directly across the street from HBO's New York City offices), with CGI being used to change the name of the building above the entrance. Production began in the fall of 2011. The schedule called for each episode‚Äîcomprising a dialogue-dense script of 80 to 90 pages ‚Äì to be filmed in nine days, as opposed to six to seven pages per day for broadcast network TV series. The pilot episode was shot using 16 mm film while the rest of the series was shot digitally on Arri Alexa cameras. Writing team With fewer than 10 credited writers, The Newsroom has fewer writers than most other television series. It was reported that Sorkin planned to replace most of the first season's writers in the second season. He later said this was untrue. Sorkin explained his approach to writing: Sorkin hired conservative media consultants for the second season to help him represent \\"every part of the ideological spectrum,\\" thus giving the show \\"a political perspective that I don't have.\\" Sorkin also revealed that the second season would include the 2012 United States presidential election. Episodes In season 1 each episode is built around a major news event from the recent past, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill or the killing of Osama Bin Laden. This acts as a background for the interpersonal drama, as well as providing a sense of familiarity, as the audience is likely to know the context and so not require too much explanation of events. Sorkin has said the news events on the show \\"will always be real\\", which, for him, \\"became a kind of creative gift. For one thing, the audience knows more than the characters do, which is kind of fun. And it gives me the chance to have the characters be smarter than we were.\\" However, he has also said \\"[i]t is a romanticised, idealised newsroom, a sort of a heightened newsroom ‚Äì it is not meant to be a documentary.\\" The second season features a story arc in which the News Night team has reported, and been forced to retract, a false news story about the United States Marine Corps using Sarin gas during the war in Afghanistan in 2009. This story is based on a real-life news scandal from 1998, in which CNN and TIME were both criticized for reporting a dubious and unreliably sourced story that the United States had used Sarin during the Operation Tailwind excursion in the Vietnam War. The third season tackles two controversial topics in news reporting. The first is the subject of citizen journalism, and the season begins with the Boston Marathon bombing and its subsequent investigation, which was quite significantly affected by the reports of social media users. The show takes on a particularly critical tone regarding the role that citizen journalists play in the coverage of major news stories, portraying the spread of misinformation and hindrance to law enforcement that ensues. This is expanded in subsequent episodes, where the idealistic, libertarian views of ACN's new buyer clash with the journalistic integrity of the team. The other major topic is whistleblowing, explored when major character Neal Sampat is contacted by an anonymous source, who leaks details of the US government's complicity in an atrocity in an African state. This leads to a clash between Will and the FBI, resulting in Will's spending time in jail for refusing to name Neal's source and being held in contempt. The whistleblowing storyline takes place in parallel to the Edward Snowden disclosures in 2013. Broadcast The Newsroom premiered in the United States on HBO on June 24, 2012. It was watched by 2.1 million viewers, making it one of HBO's most- watched series premieres since 2008. The first episode was made available free to all viewers on multiple platforms, including HBO.com, iTunes, YouTube, and other free on-demand services.

HBO Europe also began airing the show in all twelve countries with appropriate subtitles one day after the U.S. premiere. The show premiered in New Zealand on August 13, 2012, on SKY NZ's SoHo channel. The show debuted in Australia on the SoHo channel on August 20, 2012. In India, the show premiered on HBO Defined on May 21, 2013, season 2 premiered on July 30, 2013, with episodes airing two weeks after the U.S. premiere, and season 3 premiered on November 10, 2014, one day after the U.S. premiere. Currently, all episodes are available for streaming on Hotstar. Reception Critical response Critical reaction to the series in its first season was mixed. The show's second and third seasons saw more positive responses from reviewers. =Season 1= On Metacritic, the first season scored 56 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a rating of 46%, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Though it sports good intentions and benefits from moments of stellar dialogue and a talented cast, The Newsroom may feel too preachy, self satisfied, and cynical to appeal to a wide range of viewers.\\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter writes that how viewers respond to the show \\"has everything to do with whether you like his style. Because ... Sorkin is always true to himself and doesn't try to cover his tendencies or be embarrassed by them\\". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times commented that \\"at its best ... The Newsroom has a wit, sophistication and manic energy.... But at its worst, the show chokes on its own sanctimony\\". Times James Poniewozik criticized the show for being \\"smug\\" and \\"intellectually self-serving\\", with \\"Aaron Sorkin writing one argument after another for himself to win.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara said the show's drama is \\"weighted too heavily toward sermonizing diatribes\\". Reviews by newscasters have been mixed as well. Jake Tapper, then of ABC News, criticized Sorkin's partisanship: \\"they extol the Fourth Estate's democratic duty, but they believe that responsibility consists mostly of criticizing Republicans.\\" Dave Marash was not convinced that the show portrays the news industry accurately. On August 1, 2012, Sorkin responded to critics by including news consultants with newsroom experience. Former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather gave the pilot a favorable review, saying the show \\"has the potential to become a classic\\". =Season 2= The second season received generally favorable reviews. It has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 20 critics, from review aggregation website Metacritic. Rotten Tomatoes gives the season a rating of 69%, based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Thanks to focused storytelling and a more restrained tone, The Newsroom finds surer footing in its second season, even if it still occasionally succumbs to Aaron Sorkin's most indulgent whims.\\" In an early review of season 2, Verne Gay of Newsday called it: \\"Edgier, more sharply drawn, while that Sorkian chatter remains at a very high boil.\\" Oscar Moralde of Slant Magazine noted what he referred to as the show's \\"grandiloquent speechifying\\", but praised Olivia Munn calling her \\"a joy to watch\\" and concluded that \\"season two of The Newsroom salvages the promise of becoming something urgent and vital\\". Brian Lowry of Variety, in a negative review, said: \\"Ultimately, one needn't be a purveyor of snark to view The Newsroom as a disappointment‚Äîtoo smart to be dismissed, but so abrasive as to feel like Media Lectures for Dummies.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave Season 2 an overall \\"B‚àí\\" grade. =Season 3= The third and final season received positive reviews. On Metacritic, it has a score of 63 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a rating of 61%, based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"With an energetic new arc and deeper character development, The Newsroom finds itself rejuvenated in its third season‚Äîeven if it still occasionally serves as a soapbox for creator Aaron Sorkin.\\" Awards and nominations In 2012, The Newsroom was honored, along with four others, with the Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series. The series also received two nominations at the 70th Golden Globe Awards, for Best Television Series ‚Äì Drama and Best Actor ‚Äì Television Series Drama for Jeff Daniels.

Forum Erdkunde, Uni L√ºnib√ºrg. Accessed on 6 January 2008.  Definition  The term \\"glacial series\\" () was used as early as 1882 by Albrecht Penck initially for the northern Alpine Foreland. Later the term was expanded and used to refer to the Scandinavian glaciation region. The elements of an ideal and complete glacial series are: * a ground moraine with a tongue-like basin (Zungenbecken) * a terminal moraine chain that lies in an arc around the Zungenbecken * a gravel field or sandur outwash plain in front of the terminal moraine chain * a glacial meltwater valley (Urstromtal), through which meltwaters from the glacier flowed away. The term \\"glacial series\\" is restricted to landforms created by glaciers and classified by geomorphological rules, as opposed to the glacial sediments and sedimentary rocks associated with glaciers and classified by their geological features. A complete glacial series is formed when the edge of the ice sheet remains static for a long time and is not destroyed again by a further advance of the ice mass.  Glacial series in the Alpine Foreland  During glaciation (schematic representation) Following glaciation (schematic representation) The Alpine glaciers, that formed a network of ice streams during the high points of the ice ages, repeatedly flowed beyond the boundary of the Alps and advanced into the Alpine Foreland. There they formed vast foreland glaciers. In this Alpine Foreland glaciation, Penck identified a number of landforms: the ground moraines, the Zungenbecken, the terminal moraines and the gravel plains in front of them. The bowl-shaped basins, which were formed by the scouring of the ground by the glacier, were called Zungenbecken (\\"tongue basins\\"), because the tongue or snout of the glacier was once located here.Geologisches W√∂rterbuch. H. Murawski, Enke Verlag, Stuttgart 1983, , p. 249 In these basins, if there was no outlet, glacial lakes (Gletscherrandseen or Zungenbeckenstauseen) were formed during the retreat of the glacier. There is a number of lakes of this type in the Salzkammergut, for example. Typical landforms within the Zungenbecken of the Alpine Foreland are drumlins, but there are rarely any tunnel valleys. Around the Zungenbecken on the edge of the former ice sheet, are ridges of glacial till known as terminal moraines. Till is the material that makes up ground, lateral and (not always present) medial moraines. Ground moraine consists of material that was once beneath the glacier and was transported by it and deposited across wide areas of the former glacier bed. The lateral moraines comprise that eroded material which is carried along at the sides of a glacier. A lateral moraine that is no longer being actively added to with glacial material because the glacier has retreated for climatic reasons, is known as a flank moraine. In the Alps the remaining flank moraines were usually formed during the Little Ice Age in medieval times. They lie several metres higher than the present glacier surface and extend far beyond the present glacier snouts. Medial moraines are formed when the lateral moraines of two glaciers are combined when they flow together. On the far side of the morainic zone is the gravel outwash plain, which was piled up by the meltwaters of the ice mass. Those waters usually came from glacier caves whose former location is still recognisable today from the dips in the level of the terminal moraines. Often the gravel plains are markedly terraced; younger outlets have cut so-called little trumpet-shaped valleys in the older gravel plains. The material of the outwash plans is glacial till. The transport capacity of the meltwater is considerably less than that of the glacier, so that larger rocks cannot be carried out of the Zungenbecken. By contrast, elements with smaller grain size, like clays and sands can be transported much further, which is why they are rarely found in the gravel plains. Glacial meltwater valleys (Urstromt√§ler) emerged as a result of meltwater flowing away in a direction parallel to the edge of the ice mass and are a feature of Northern Central Europe. These valleys, created by glacial meltwaters, do not appear in the Alpine Foreland as they do, for example, in North Germany because their function was assumed by the great rivers that already existed in the region - the Danube, Rhine, Rh√¥ne and Po - or their tributaries, which transported away the meltwaters of the glaciers.  Glacial series in Northern Central Europe  Weichselian meltwater valleys in Brandenburg The Scandinavian ice sheet reached or crossed Northern Central Europe several times. The landforms of the glacial series here thus follow one another from north to south: The ground moraine landscape consists predominantly in flat to gently rolling terrain, on which the ice mass deposited till. Zungenbecken, where the scouring of material played a significant role, occur to a lesser extent and are an element of the ground moraine landscape in the Scandinavian glaciation region. Because the advancing ice sheet completely buried the landscape, ice age landforms and depositions are found over much of North Germany. Tunnel valleys, by contrast, are not commonly found in Northern Central Europe. Terminal moraines sweep in a giant arc around the ground moraine zone to the south. These terminal moraines are often incompletely formed and lower than in the Alpine Foreland, but are nevertheless clearly visible in the low-relief of the North German Plain. Because of their many gaps, the neutral term, Eisrandlage (\\"ice margin location\\") has been preferred for the line of terminal moraine ridges in North Germany. More or less extensive sandurs border the terminal moraines. They are alluvial fans created by the glacial meltwaters. They were also fed with water that poured out of the glacier caves and cut through the terminal moraine ridges. The meltwaters that flowed across the sandur, collected in the meltwater valley and flowed parallel to the margin of the ice sheet, mostly in a northwesterly direction. Meltwater valleys are a special landform in Northern Central Europe.  Glacial series as a model of landscape formation  Like all models, the model of the glacial series gives only a simplified picture of the real situation. In particular, it is often forgotten that the landforms of the glacial series were formed almost at the same time alongside one another, whilst the ice margin remained static by the terminal moraine. Furthermore the ice then had to advance as far as the later terminal moraines and then melt away again. The processes that accompany that, clearly alter the model of the glacial series. A common variation, for example, is the spillage of younger meltwaters over older ground moraine beds. In addition, a further advance of the glacier can result in the interlacing of various older landforms of the glacial series. For example, lines of terminal moraines lying close behind one another in the Brandenburg region of Germany drained over the same sandurs and via the same meltwater valley.

Born in Trondheim to a prosperous mercantile family of German extraction, he travelled to Hamburg, Germany to study commerce. Upon his father's death, he inherited the family business, though his brother-in-law Lorentz Johannsen became its director. With the family firm's trade ships Knudtzon often travelled to foreign destinations in Southeast Asia. At one occasion the ship wrecked; in the subsequent tumult he made friends with the Scot Alexander Baillie, with whom he would later travel around Europe. His profound interest in art was expressed in his numerous donations to artists and his own art collection, which included both antiquities and contemporary artworks. The Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen made sculptures of Knudtzon and Baillie; as an expression of gratitude, Knudtzon advocated the creation of a museum dedicated to Thorvaldsen in Copenhagen. Biography J√∏rgen von Cappelen Knudtzon was born on 28 April 1784 in Trondheim; he was the second child of Hans Carl Knudtzon (1751‚Äì1823), a merchant and politician, and Karen Knudtzon (n√©e M√ºller, 1752‚Äì1818).Bratberg, Terje. \\"Knudtzon.\\" Trondheim byleksikon.

J√∏rgen von Cappelen Knudtzon did not belong to the Norwegian Cappelen family but was named after a friend of his father from that family. Following his father's death, his brother-in-law Lorentz Johannsen (1769‚Äì1837) became director of the family business. Knudtzon saw the opportunity to travel to foreign destinations as supercargo on the firm's trade ships; he once travelled to the West Indies in a ship that wrecked near Jamaica. On the rescue ship he met the young Scot Alexander Baillie, who became his friend and lifelong associate. They travelled around together in Europe, meeting Napoleon, Lord Byron and the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. On his return from Europe, Knudtzon established himself as a benefactor in Trondheim. With his profound interest in art, he gave donations to Norwegian artists and maintained a personal art collection with artworks from both antiquity and his own time. In the years 1815‚Äì1816, Bertel Thorvaldsen made busts of J√∏rgen Knudtzon, J√∏rgen's father and Baillie, which J√∏rgen's brother Broder Knudtzon subsequently bequeathed to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.

Biography Born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, Billy Bell studied agriculture at Duff's Business Institute in Pittsburgh. He moved west to California at age 25 in 1911, and held a series of golf jobs at the Pasadena Country Club, including caddymaster and course superintendent. Bell worked on golf course construction for architect Willie Watson, including serving as Watson's superintendent, before going into golf course design and development on his own in 1920.The Golf Course, by Geoffrey Cornish and Ronald Whitten, 1981, New York, The Rutledge Press, , p. 166 Most of Bell's courses were designed and built in southern California. He is considered one of the most important golf course architects in the state, with more than fifty courses credited to his work and design, and he designed and built courses in other western states as well, including Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, and Hawaii. Early in his design career, Bell worked closely with famous designer and fellow Pennsylvanian George C. Thomas, Jr., on courses which included the Riviera Country Club, often cited as one of the world's best courses. Although Thomas is listed as architect of record, Bell made significant contributions to many of the designs. Bell's son William F. Bell (1918‚Äì1984) trained with him, joined him in partnership after World War II, and later became an important golf course architect in his own right.

Built in 1925, this Renaissance Revival building served as the town's high school for 30 years, and then as an elementary school for 45. It was the town's first purpose-built high school. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The former Acton High School is set at the northeast corner of Charter Road and Massachusetts Avenue (Massachusetts Route 111) near the geographic center of the town, and adjacent to a number of its other school buildings. It is a two-story brick building in a U shape, with Renaissance Revival styling. Its south-facing front facade has a stepped parapet, obscuring a flat roof. Its central block is fifteen bays wide, with two projecting entry pavilions. The entrances are framed by simple molding and topped by segmented-arch pediments, with narrow windows in the pavilion above. Bands of limestone trim separate the first and second stories, and the second story and the cornice. The building corners are quoined with limestone blocks. The building was designed by Boston architect/engineer John H. Bickford, and built in 1925. It was the town's first purpose-built high school building, its previous high school classes (begun in 1883) having been rotated through other school buildings in the system. The building served in that capacity for thirty years. It then served another 45 years as an elementary school, during which time a substantial addition was made to bring the building to its present configuration. The school was finally closing in 2000. It has been converted to residences.

Early life The son of a Methodist clergyman, John Harold Peel was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Queen's College, Oxford. Career Studying and specialising in gynaecology at King's College London School of Medicine, London, he qualified as a doctor in 1930, and passed his membership exams for the Royal College of Physicians in 1932. Appointed consultant surgeon for obstetrics and gynaecology at King's College Hospital, in 1937 he moved to the Princess Beatrice Hospital in London, where he remained as a consultant until 1965. Between 1948 and 1967, Peel was director of clinical studies at King's College Hospital Medical School. He was an examiner at around a dozen British universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, London and Bristol. Peel became a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1944. In 1955 he became a member of its council, and in 1959 its honorary treasurer, there by raising sufficient funds to allow the college to move into premises in Regent's Park. Between 1966 and 1969 he was President of the RCOG, elected to an honorary fellowship in 1989. Surgeon-Gynaecologist to Queen Elizabeth II Peel assisted Royal Surgeon-Gynaecologist Sir William Gilliatt at the births of Prince Charles (1948) and Princess Anne (1950). After the death of Sir William Gilliatt in 1956, from 1961 to 1973 Peel himself was appointed Surgeon-Gynaecologist to Queen Elizabeth II. Peel hence delivered a number of royal births, including: The Prince Andrew (1960); The Prince Edward (1964) (both assisted by John Brudenell), Viscount Linley (1961) and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (1964). Peel himself was replaced by Sir George Pinker. Abortion Act 1967 Whilst President of the RCOG, in 1967 Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act; the Committee reported in favour of the bill. Peel Report 1971 Peel headed a number of steering groups and committees to government agencies, which included chairing the important Peel Report: Enquiry into Domiciliary Midwifery Beds Needs (1971) for the Department of Health and Social Security. To reduce maternal and infant mortality, the report recommended that all women should give birth in a hospital and remain there for some days. Among the Report's critics was epidemiologist Archie Cochrane, who pointed out that there was little correlation between high hospitalisation rates and lower perinatal mortality. The report however resulted in a change in the medical establishment's approach to maternity, at the expense of domiciliary midwifery services. Other works Peel was the author of Textbook of Gynaecology (1943); Lives of the Fellows of Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 1929‚Äì1969 (1976); and Biography of William Blair Bell (1986). In the 1980s, as sponsor of the Responsible Society, Peel accused the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Social Security of encouraging girls under 16 to have sexual intercourse: Personal life Peel was married three times: His first marriage was to Muriel Elaine Pellow in 1936, with whom he had a daughter; in 1947 he married Freda Margaret Mellish; and two years after the death of his second wife, he married Sally Barton in 1993. Peel was a keen gardener, owned a stock of Friesian cattle on his farm, and enjoyed Salmon fishing on the River Spey in Scotland.

Around 1916, the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company moved its corporate offices from Desloge, Missouri, to the Rialto Building in downtown St. Louis. While \\"St. Louis, with its French ancestry, has been noted as a fur capital, more money passed through St. Louis as a result of the lead business in Missouri than did because of the fur business,\\" wrote Doe Run Company CEO Jeffry Zelm.

In 2011, Watlow, still a Desloge family business, employed 2,000 employees in 13 factories in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia; had sales offices in 16 countries; and distributed globally. Firmin Desloge, II son, Joseph Desloge, designed an industry-specialty electric fuse that would \\"kill the arc\\" and founded Killark Electric in 1913.

They are sometimes called Jogi or simply Yogi, and are known for a variety of siddha yoga practices. Their tradition is known as Nath Sampradaya.AK Banerjea (1983), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana- Sangraha,  History  The yogis were primarily associated with the Yogic- traditions promoted by the great Nath saints, e.g. Matsyendranath, Gorakshanath, Chauranginath etc. Hatha yoga is considered as the prominent part of those traditions promoted by these great Nath masters. The Nath Sampradaya is considered as a development of the earlier Siddha or Avadhuta Sampradaya,Deshpande, M.N. (1986). The Caves of Panhale-Kaji. New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, Government of India. an ancient lineage of spiritual masters. The Nath yogis are classical followers of Shaivism; it was not a caste it is followed by different communities it was a sect within Hindu religion. In 1664 CE, Jogis (Giris) and Sannyasi (Puris) battled each other as detailed in the Tabaqat-i-Akbari, both are 2 of the 10 akharas (orders) of Dashanami Sampradaya. Puris were outnumbered by 200 to 500 by Jogis, Akbar asked his soldiers to smear ash and join Puris to help them, this led to the victory of Puris,David N. Lorenzen, 2006, Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, p.51-54.  Organization  The principles of Yoga philosophy of Nath tradition are stated in Sanskrit texts such as Gorakshagita, Goraksha Paddhati, Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati, Amaraugha Sasana, Amaraugha Prabodha, Mahartha Manjari, Gheranda Samhita. Hatha yoga includes disciplines, postures (asana), purification procedures (shatkriya), gestures (mudra), breathing (pranayama), meditation (dhyana), samadhi. The Nath tradition is a syncretic Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hindu philosophy based Shaiva tradition, that reveres Shiva and Dattatreya. Its founding is attributed to the ideas of Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath, developed further with an additional seven other Siddha Yoga Gurus called \\"Naths\\" (literally, lords). The Nath Yogi sampradaya and monastic organizations grew starting with the 13th century, with its matha headquarters in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. Many of their mathas are found in the northern, central and western states of India particularly in the Himalayas, but archeological inscriptions suggest their mathas existed in south India as well. The early Nath monks received endowments in Karnataka, for example, between the 10th and 13th century, which later became a temple and Shaiva matha hub for them near Mangalore. The Kadri matha, for instance, is one of the legendary monasteries in the Nath tradition which attracted converts from Buddhism and infusion of Buddhist ideas into Shaivism. Nath Shaiva monastic organization was one of those Hindu monk groups that militarized and took up arms following the Muslim conquest of India, to resist persecution.David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism, Yoda Press, , pages 51-63David Gordon White (2011), Sinister Yogis, University of Chicago Press, , pages 198-207William Pinch (2012), Warrior Ascetics and Indian Empires, Cambridge University Press, , pages 4-9, 28-34, 61-65, 150-151, 189-191, 194-207 They were scorned and persecuted by Mughal Empire officials, and by social, cultural and religious elites.Shail Mayaram (2003), Against History, Against State, Columbia University Press, , pages 40-41, 39 However, the Nath yogi monks have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia since medieval times.David N. Lorenzen and Adri√°n Mu√±oz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, SUNY Press, , pages x-xi The Nath tradition of Shaivism is credited with establishing numerous Shiva Hindu temples and monasteries, particularly in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, north Bihar, and Nepal. Yogi Nath in Bengal In British colonial census, Yogi Nath were classified as a Bengali Hindu caste descended from the Nath Sampradaya (sect). Many of them then settled in the outlying tracts of eastern Bengal, especially in the districts of Sylhet, Tipperah, Noakhali, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Dhaka. Many of the yogis adopted weaving as profession.

Throughout the year, 21 tropical cyclones became named storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Alma formed on May 12, 1990, three days before the season's official start on May 15\\\\. The Central Pacific hurricane season began on June 1, covering tropical cyclone formation in the region between 140¬∞W and International Dateline. Hurricane Trudy was the last storm to dissipate, doing so on November 1, nearly a month before the Pacific hurricane season officially ended on November 30. The season produced twenty-seven tropical depressions, of which twenty-one became named storms, and sixteen strengthened into hurricanes. Six out of the sixteen hurricanes strengthened into major hurricanes. Despite high levels of activity, Rachel was the only system to make landfall, bringing floods to Northwestern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Thousands were left homeless, and there were 18 confirmed fatalities. Additionally, the remnants of Hurricane Boris brought light showers to California. At that time, Hurricane Hernan was the strongest Pacific hurricane to have its intensity estimated via satellite imagery; this record was matched by Hurricane Trudy months later. One tropical storm formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's warning zone and eventually crossed the International Dateline before dissipating. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post- storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, and dissipations during the season.

Launch In November 2011 Lenovo said it would soon unveil a smart television product called LeTV, expected for release in the first quarter of 2012. \\"The PC, communications and TV industries are currently undergoing a 'smart' transformation. In the future, users will have many smart devices and will desire an integrated experience of hardware, software and cloud services.\\" Liu Jun, president of Lenovo's mobile-Internet and digital-home-business division. Lenovo unveiled its first smart TV at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The company said the set would be available for sale in Mainland China in April 2012. During a keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show, Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm asked Liu Jun, head of mobile products for Lenovo, to demonstrate the K91. Lenovo released the K91 in Mainland China on 8 May 2012. Lenovo opted to release its first smart television in China because it would be easier to negotiate deals for content in its home market. Hardware Lenovo's first smart TV, the LeTV, used the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. The LeTV features the ability to display 3D content, a face-recognition feature designed to help parents limit the time their children spend watching TV, and voice recognition. The LeTV will be offered in 42-inch and 55-inch screen sizes. The LeTV also allows smart phones and tablets to be used as remote controls. As the K91 is an Android-based device, it is capable of running hundreds of applications available for download online. Lenovo has created an app store dedicated specifically to the K91. The LeTV uses a Qualcomm 8060 Snapdragon dual-core processor running at 1.5 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of flash storage, and Android 4 ICS. The LeTV has a five-megapixel webcam built into its bezel. It has a remote and game controllers. The LeTV's remote features a microphone necessary for the TV's voice recognition functions and a track pad. The game controller has track pad, and embedded motion sensor. In March 2014 Lenovo announced the S9 smart television. Nicknamed the \\"Terminator\\", the S9 is based on NVIDIA's powerful Tegra K1 chip. The 50-inch set has 4K resolution and runs a customised version of Android 4.2. The S9 makes use of a small removable module called a Smart Card. The Smart Card is about the size of a deck of cards, has a micro-USB port, a micro SD slot, and a proprietary 70-pin connector that plugs into the TV.
