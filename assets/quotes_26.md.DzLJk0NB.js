A historical people of the same name are mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Etymology Etymologically, he who can cast terror on all sides is called an Abhira. In Sanskrit, A is a prefix to imply opposite of any word and bhƒ´ru(‡§≠‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Å) means afraid. History Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya says that the Abhiras are mentioned in the first-century work of classical antiquity, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. He considers them to be a race rather than a tribe. Scholars such as Ramaprasad Chanda believe that they were Indo-Aryan peoples. but others, such as Romila Thapar, believe them to have been indigenous. The Puranic Abhiras occupied the territories of Herat; they are invariably juxtaposed with the Kalatoyakas and Haritas, the peoples of Afghanistan. According to Jayant Gadkari tribes such as Vrusni, Andhaka, Satvatas and Abhiras after a period of long conflicts came to be known as Yadavas. In the Padma-puranas and certain literary works, the Abhiras are referred to as belonging to the race of Krishna. There is no certainty regarding the occupational status of the Abhiras, with ancient texts sometimes referring to them as warriors, pastoral and cowherders but at other times as plundering tribes. Along with the Vrishnis, the Satvatas and the Yadavas, the Abhiras were followers of the Vedas, who worshipped Krishna, the head and preceptor of these tribes. In archaeological inscriptions Abhiras are mentioned as belonging to the race of Lord Krishna. According to K. P. Jayaswal the abhiras of Gujarat are the same race as Rastrikas of Emperor Asoka and Yadavas of the Mahabharatha. =Connection to Ahir= According to Ganga Ram Garg, the modern-day Ahir caste are descendants of Abhira people and the term Ahir is the Prakrit form of the Sanskrit term Abhira. Bhattacharya says that the terms Ahir, Ahar and Gaoli are current forms of the word Abhira. This view gets support in many writings. M. S. A. Rao and historians such as P. M. Chandorkar and T. Padmaja have explained that epigraphical and historical evidence exists for equating the Ahirs with the ancient Abhiras and Yadava tribe. Rule of the Konkan From 203 to 270 the Abhiras ruled over the whole of the Deccan Plateau as a paramount power. The Abhiras were the immediate successors of the Satavahanas. Abhiras of Gupta empire  During the reign of Samudragupta (c. 350), the Abhiras lived in Rajputana and Malava on the western frontier of the Gupta empire. Historian Dineshchandra Sircar thinks of their original abode was the area of Abhiravan, between Herat and Kandahar, although this is disputed. Their occupation of Rajasthan also at later date is evident from the Jodhpur inscription of Samvat 918 that the Abhira people of the area were a terror to their neighbours, because of their violent demeanour. Abhiras of Rajputana were sturdy and regarded as Mlecchas, and carried on anti-Brahmanical activities. As a result, life and property became unsafe. Pargiter points to the Pauranic tradition that the Vrishnis and Andhakas, while retreating northwards after the Kurukshetra War from their western home in Dwarka and Gujarat, were attacked and broken up by the rude Abhiras of Rajasthan. They were the supporters of the DuryodhanaMan in India, Volume 54-page-39 and Kauravas, and in the Mahabharata,Ancient Nepal Abhir, Gopa, Gopal and Yadavas are all synonyms. They defeated the hero of Mahabharatha war, and did spare him when he disclosed the identity of the members of the family of Sri Krishna. The Gopas, whom Krishna had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavas themselves, who were also the Abhiras.Ethnic history of Gujarat The Abhiras also have been described as Vrata Kshatriyas. The Abhiras did not stop in Rajasthan; some of their clans moved south and west reaching Saurashtra and Maharashtra and taking service under the Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps. Also founded a kingdom in the northern part of the Maratha country, and an inscription of the ninth year of the Abhira king Ishwarsena.

Learning Exchange In 2005, the Learning Exchange was launched as the world's first interactive library of digital learning resources for social work education. This repository is catalogued in accordance with international metadata standards and Learning object metadata, allowing interoperability with other systems. In particular the intention was that multimedia learning objects could be downloaded as IMSIMS is a non-profit standards organisation concerned with establishing interoperability for learning systems and learning content - http://www.imsglobal.org packages and uploaded into virtual learning environments in higher education institutions. Originally the Learning Exchange was built on IntraLibrary software and access restricted to students and staff of the higher educational institutions in Scotland engaged in teaching social work. Access was password protected using the Athens Eduserve authentication system. Subsequently the Learning Exchange was added to the NHS Education for Scotland (NES) portfolio of content accessible via Athens Eduserve. This made Learning Exchange available to the higher education sector and the entire social services workforce. In practice much of the content of the Learning Exchange did not require password protection, partly because in 2008 Iriss adopted a policy of releasing its own content using Creative Commons licensing. Password protection was therefore removed and a simple search interface OpenSearch created which queried the database by SRU. In 2010, the Learning Exchange was rebuilt using Drupal, an open source content management system. The ability to allow metadata harvesting by third parties means that Learning Exchange content is automatically searchable by Social Services Knowledge Scotlandhttp://www.ssks.org.uk (SSKS), a portal to social service knowledge and information created by NHS Education for Scotland (NES) in partnership with Iriss, Scottish Social Services Learning Networks and the Social Care Institute for Excellence. Multimedia In 2005 Iriss began creating web-based multimedia learning objects based on scenarios devised by social work educators, scripted, professional actors cast, and filmed by professional filmmakers. Examples include: * Imagining the Future, a creative exploration looks at what will social care, support and community be like in Scotland 2025. This key piece of research was released in November 2014 and was met with favourable review. * Children, Families and Child ProtectionChildren, Families and Child Protection - http://www.iriss.org.uk/childprotection, accessed 10 March 2011 focuses on the legal, ethical and practice issues emerging from a child protection case scenario. * The Assessment TriangleThe Assessment Triangle - http://www.iriss.org.uk/opencontent/assessment, accessed 10 March 2011 was adopted within the development of the Integrated Assessment Framework of GIRFEC. * The Golden Bridgehttp://www.iriss.ac.uk/goldenbridge documents the migration of Home Children from Scotland to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century. It includes artefacts, such as photographs, from Quarriers organisation, a major voluntary sector childcare agency. Audio and Video In 2006, Iriss began recording research seminars and other events as an effective and inexpensive way of capturing and sharing knowledge. These recordings were made available as a podcasthttp://www.iriss.org.uk/audio either direct from the Iriss website or from the iTunes Store. In June 2012 the podcast series was superseded by IRISS.FM internet radio. Iriss also uses Vimeo,http://vimeo.com/iriss for video streaming. Knowledge Management Strategy Iriss collaborated with NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and other stakeholders to create The Knowledge Management Strategy for the Social Services which was derived from Changing Lives.Scottish Executive (2006) Report of the recommendations made by the 21st Century Social Work Review Group for the future of social services in Scotland. http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/02094408/0, Accessed 29 December 2009 The Knowledge Management Strategy for the Social Services was revised and new edition A Strategy and Action Plan for Embedding Knowledge in Practice in Scotland's Social Services http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/10/4809 published by the Scottish Government in November 2012 As the ubiquity of the web has grown, new skills are required, known collectively as information literacy: ‚Äòthe ability to find, evaluate and use digital information effectively, efficiently and ethically'.For more definitions see In collaboration with NHS Education for Scotland Iriss developed a series of manuals aimed at helping social services practitioners develop their information literacy skills, as well as a simple interactive web-based introductory tutorial.http://www.iriss.org.uk/informationliteracy Evidence informed practice Iriss has developed a number of tools and services to promote and foster the use of evidence to inform practice. Confidence through Evidence is a toolkit designed to help practitioners acquire, assess, adapt and apply evidence in practice. A complementary library of evidence summaries was created within the Learning Exchange. A Champions Network has been established to foster links between Iriss and social services workforce in both the statutory and voluntary sectors. The Research Advice Service was set up to support the social care workers carrying out their own research. Innovation and improvement The Innovation and Improvement programme promotes new thinking for social services in Scotland. The programme develops tools, training and interventions that will support and enable the sustainable transformation of social services in Scotland. Technical barriers In 2010, Iriss commissioned a report, \\"Social Media in the Social Services\\", which was published as an interactive document inviting comment and discussion. Iriss continues (partly though the Just Do It! blogJust Do It! http://blogs.iriss.org.uk/socialmedia) to urge public bodies to open up access to social media and trust professional staff to act responsibly.

CHP works with a small professional staff and a large number of volunteers to fight for the protection of China‚Äôs tangible and intangible cultural heritage.  Aims Through capacity building, education, networking, advocacy, publicity, and offering constructive and creative solutions, CHP provides a vehicle for channeling the energies of communities in protecting their heritage. CHP works to: * raise awareness of cultural conservation in local communities, * involve people directly in the oversight and management of their heritage, * to call attention to and campaign against threats to cultural heritage, * to press for implementation of and adherence to, at local levels, heritage protection laws and policies, * to raise the visibility of heritage protection in government planning and in media coverage. * to stop people who wants to build buildings on the sites of China's cultural artifacts.  Heritage of cities and towns  In the haste of economic development and infrastructure modernization, China's architectural heritage and the attendant traditional ways of life are disappearing. CHP is broadening its urban programs through a ‚ÄúCultural Action Network‚Äù of volunteers to monitor the urban heritage situation in major cities and towns around China, and to coordinate CHP‚Äôs heritage protection efforts with local governments, communities, and media. = Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin Residence = In 2009, CHP pleaded for preservation of the historic residence. As a result, in 2010, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage designated Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin‚Äôs residence as a protected cultural site. = Drum and Bell Tower Neighborhood = The area was put at risk when the government announced a plan to convert it into a ‚ÄúBeijing Time Cultural City‚Äù. CHP opposed the plan and organized a press conference to direct attention to the demolition threat. CHP‚Äôs efforts resulted in cancellation of the project in late 2010. = North Xisi = Xisibei is a historic hutong area in Beijing dating back to the Qing Dynasty, and is one of the historic conservation districts of the city. Despite the laws protecting it, Xisibei faced demolition. After CHP led discussion on Xisibei and generated media exposure and public opposition to the development plan, the Xisibei development project was canceled by government decision.  Ethnic minority cultural revitalization China is home to 55 ethnic minorities, totaling close to 100 million people. CHP works to restore pride of Chinese ethnic minorities in their ancestral traditions, and to assist them in incorporating cultural heritage revitalization in poverty alleviation and modernization programs. = Mengma Archive (2005-2008/Yunnan Province) = CHP assisted a group of elders of the Dai minority of Meng Ma Village in Yunnan Province to document their culture.

Named after head coach Tom Izzo, the Izzone consists of nearly 4,000 members, seated in both the lower and upper bowls of the Breslin Center. With close to 4,000 members cheering on the MSU Men's Basketball team, the Izzone helps give the Breslin Center an exciting and intimidating atmosphere, and a considerable home-court advantage. History The Izzone's roots can be found in the current alumni of Derrick Barber and Jeff Heck. Jud Heathcote. Spartan Spirits had a t-shirt theme each season. Among the most popular themes was Jud's Jungle, used in Heathcote's final season in 1994‚Äì95. When Tom Izzo became head coach, the Student Alumni Foundation(SAF) planned to keep the Spartan Spirits name, and the tradition of t-shirt themes would continue. In September 1995, SAF collected suggestions for a new t-shirt. John McPherson submitted the Izzone name, which was selected for the 1995‚Äì96 theme. The Izzone name was so popular it replaced the Spartan Spirits as the group's name. The Izzone only had 180 members in that first season. The Izzone has grown considerably since 1995‚Äì96, thanks to Coach Izzo's support. With a Big Ten championship in 1998 and 1999 and an NCAA championship in 2000, the team was quickly becoming more widely known and appreciated on campus, and therefore the Izzone expanded as well. The inner working The Izzone is run by a student leadership group working directly with members of Michigan State Athletic's Marketing Department. The directors set up the student sections before every game by placing a newspaper, a bag, and a cotton towel. The directors are also responsible for tracking the attendance of all Izzone members, scanning id's at the door, and planning other events, such as the Izzone campout. Lower bowl eligibility The Izzone is split into two sections, the upper bowl, and the lower bowl of the Breslin Center. The lower bowl is more desired by students because of its location closest to the basketball court. In order for a student to qualify for the lower bowl, they must meet the following criteria: * Students eligible to order student season basketball admission must be enrolled full-time in a degree-granting program at MSU's East Lansing campus for both Fall and Spring semesters. Lifelong education students do not qualify as students enrolled in a degree granting program. College of Education students working towards their teaching certificate are allowed a one-year grace period (provided they are enrolled full-time). * Students must have a high attendance record to the basketball games, arriving early to make check-in. * First time ticket holders are automatically put in the upper bowl, and are reviewed for the coming season for lower bowl. * Must attend the Izzone campout event, if not, must fill out an excuse form with proper documentation. Members of the Izzone regularly research opponents and create \\"scouting reports\\" with information from the internet and other sources. Grade point averages, police records, and embarrassing nicknames are popular. =Izzone campout= Students must attend the annual September Izzone camp out if they want a chance of getting lower- bowl tickets. Returning lower-bowl members who have completed the camp out and missed two games or fewer the previous season are given first priority. The Izzone witnessed a 53-home-game win streak, spanning from the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season until the middle of the 2001‚Äì2002 season. Michigan State lost March 1, 1998, 99‚Äì96 in overtime to Purdue. The next home loss was January 12, 2002, 64‚Äì63 to Wisconsin.

Robinson, Mary Astor, Ricardo Cortez, Louis Calhern, Mae Clarke, and David Landau. The story was adapted by Tom Reed and Niven Busch from the play The Dark Tower by George S. Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott. The Man with Two Faces was actress Margaret Dale's last movie and her only talkie. She and Anton Stengel are the only two actors from the Broadway play to appear in the film. In 2010, this film became available on DVD from the Warner Archive Collection.The American Film Institute Catalog of Feature Films: 1931-40 by The AFI c.1993The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993: The Man with Two Faces(Wayback) Plot Jessica Wells (Astor) is a beautiful and talented actress, returning to the stage after a three-year absence. Although her triumphal return seems certain, family and friends are shocked when Vance (Calhern), her long-lost husband with a criminal past, shows up at the family home. He immediately exerts his influence on the vivacious Jessica, and she becomes a sleepwalking automaton blindly obeying orders. The avaricious and opportunistic Vance (who appears carrying pet mice in a cage) has heard that his wife holds half the rights to the play in which she will be featured, a prospective hit, but a certain disaster in her somnambulist state. Stage star Damon Wells (Robinson) lends theatrical prestige to his sister's comeback while helping to reclaim her talent as her acting coach. He and Jessica's manager (Cortez) realize that the verminous Vance must be dealt with at once, so Damon begins an elaborate ruse, presenting himself to the schemer as the bearded French theatrical producer Jules Chautard. Vance is lured to a hotel room by Jules/Damon, thinking that he will be paid handsomely for Jessica's half-interest in the play, but is instead drugged and then stabbed to death. Damon cannily covers his tracks in the murder, but he accidentally leaves a few theatrical mustache-whiskers when closing a Gideon Bible. Police Sergeant William Curtis (Landau) cracks the case when he connects the artificial hair to the art of an actor and confronts Damon in his dressing room. The detective, however, is aware of the suspicious past of the victim and not unsympathetic to the actor. Wells is left with the suggestion that he can perhaps act his way out of the rap.

Sarcoptes anthracis was classified by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1901 after first occurrences of infection on Asian Tufted Deers. The parasitic itch mite burrows into skin and causes sarcoptic mange, mostly seen on even-toed ungulates. Pregnant female mites tunnel into the stratum corneum of a host's skin and deposit eggs in the burrows. Young mites move about on the skin and molt into a \\"nymphal\\" stage, hosting Bacillus anthracis in their digestive tract. They act as a vector that carries and transmits anthrax to their hosts causing an infection, which often results in death because the immune system was weakened by scabies before. The high host specificity of the mites is held responsible for the fact that mostly even- toed ungulates struggled with these consequences. In late 1950s the last foci of infection were reported in semi-domesticated reindeers after which no greater incidences were observed.

It is a method of theatrical production used consistently since the 16th century, particularly common in 19th-century England and the United States. History The first actor-managers, such as Robert Browne, appeared in the late 16th- century, to be followed by another Robert Browne (no relation) and George Jolly in the 17th-century. In the 18th-century, actor-managers such as Colley Cibber and David Garrick gained prominence. The system of actor-management generally produced high standards of performance, as demonstrated by such 19th-century actors as William Macready, Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving, Frank Benson and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, by husband-wife teams such as Squire Bancroft and Effie Bancroft, Frank Wyatt and Violet Melnotte, William Hunter Kendal and Madge Robertson Kendal and Thomas and Priscilla German Reed, and by women stars, such as Lucia Elizabeth Vestris, Selina Dolaro, Evelyn Millard, Sarah Bernhardt, Sarah Thorne, Gertrude Kingston, Emily Soldene, Laura Keene and Lydia Thompson, among many others.The Actor-manager system on Answers.comDefinition of 'actor-manager' the Free Dictionary The Bells, 1874 In the 19th-century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art. The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite \\"stars.\\" A new role emerged for the actor-managers who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the production, and the financing.James Eli Adams, ed., Encyclopedia of the Victorian era (2004) 1:2‚Äì3. When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs and coffee shops rang with lively debates palming the relative merits of the stars of their productions. Henry Irving (1838‚Äì1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers.George Rowell, Theatre in the Age of Irving (Rowman & Littlefield, 1981). Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. The 19th-century repertoire usually consisted of a combination of the works of Shakespeare, popular melodramas, and new dramas, comedies or musical theatre works. The era of the actor-manager was geared to star performances, such as Irving's role in the 1871 play The Bells.'The Actor-manager System'. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica =20th century= The system of actor-management waned in the early 20th- century, as actor-managers were replaced first by stage managers and later by theatre directors. In addition, the system of actor-management was adversely affected by factors such as the increasing cost of mounting theatrical productions, more corporate ownership of theatres, such as by the Theatrical Syndicate, Edward Laurillard and The Shubert Organization, a trend toward ensemble-style acting, and a move towards the financial security offered by long runs rather than rotating plays for a short period. After the end of World War II a combination of social, financial and technological factors, combined with the rising popularity of film and radio, lead to the diminishing of the actor-manager system, with its last two great exponents being Sir Donald Wolfit and Sir Laurence Olivier, both of whom were actively working within a (by then) old fashioned framework.Sylvia Morriss The last of the actor-managers taking Shakespeare on tour: Donald Wolfit Though no longer the standard practice, modern actor-managers do exist and increasingly fringe work is being explored on this model as actors look to provide themselves with an artistic platform which they have the means to control. Examples include Kevin Spacey when he worked as the artistic director of the Old Vic in London, Samuel West when he briefly ran the Sheffield CrucibleWilkinson, Chris. \\"Whatever happened to the actor-manager?\\" The Guardian, 16 July 2008 and Kenneth Branagh in the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company.

Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint made the first sketches for the church but after his death it was completed by his son, Kaare Klint, and built from 1935 to 1937. Its style is remniscient of Grundtvig's Church, Jensen Klint's most famous work, which was also completed posthumously by Kaare Klint, although on a much smaller scale. History Bethlehem Church is one of many churches in Copenhagen built by the Copenhagen Church Trust, founded in 1890 to collect money and build new churches in the rapidly growing Danish capital, and Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint was charged with the design. He had already designed Anna Church and the monumental Grundtvig's Church in Copenhagen as well as Gedser Church on the island og Falster and St. Hans Tveje' Church in Odense. Jensen-Klint also designed a congregation house close by which was completed in 1931. After Jensen-Klint's death on 1 December 1930, Kaare Klint, his son, completed the design process based on his father's initial sketches. The church was built from 1935 to 1937 and consecrated on 13 February 1938 by the Bishop of Copenhagen. Architecture The church building is integrated in the row of houses and the facade toward the street is built in red brick. Its style is strongly remniscient of Jensen Klint's other churches with elements from Gothic Revival architecture and Brick Expressionism. Interior The three nave church room is relatively short and therefore appears strikingly high. All inside walls are clad in yellow brickwork. Furnishings Kaare Klint designed all furnishings and fittings. All but the font are executed in light-coloured timber with a minimum of detail. The ciborium above the altar is inspired by the altar in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The canopy over the pulpit is decorated with a Star of David. The church is the first church in Denmark to use individual chairs instead of benches. Designed specifically for the church, the chair later won great popularity, both for use in other churches and when it became commercially available for private homes.

Essays presented to W.B. Bonnor on his 65th BirthdayWilliam Bowen Bonnor Quotations was a mathematician and gravitation physicist best known for his research into astrophysics, cosmology and general relativity. For most of his academic career he was a professor of mathematics at the University of London. William Bonnor was born in London on 13 September 1920. He was educated at County High School, Ilford, at South East Essex Technical College and at Birkbeck College. His degrees of B.Sc., Ph.D. and D.Sc. were all obtained by part-time study. On leaving school in 1937 Bonnor served in clerical and executive branches of the Civil Service until 1944, when he became a chemist in the Admiralty, doing development work in paint technology. In 1946 he joined Shell Refining and Marketing Company to work on the rheology of lubricating greases. His career as a mathematician commenced in 1949 after obtaining a degree in mathematics at Birkbeck College. He joined the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, where he met his future wife, Jean Stott, a staff tutor in social science. In 1957 he was appointed Reader and head of the mathematics department at Queen Elizabeth College (QEC), University of London. He was promoted to Professor in 1962, and stayed with the College until retirement in 1985. This period was the golden age of general relativity, and Bonnor played a part in it, particularly in the London Relativity Seminar. This had begun at Imperial College in the 1950s, moved to King's College and then to QEC from 1977 to 1983. He was also active internationally, making contact with scientific workers in the socialist countries in eastern Europe, particularly those in Jena in East Germany. During this period he published a paper on the Bonnor Beam which models the gravitational field of a beam of light. Bonnor held visiting appointments at the Universities of Illinois (1960‚Äì61), Otago (1984) and Cape Town (1984‚Äì86). In 1999 he was awarded the honorary degree of D.Sc. by the University of Portsmouth. Bonnor's research was published in about 150 papers in various scientific journals. The most cited paper described the effect of gravitation on Boyle's law; this has been extensively used in the theory of star formation. Another well-cited paper applies Newtonian dynamics to the formation of galaxies in cosmology. However, most of Bonnor's research was on the theory of general relativity. In this area he worked on the theory of gravitational waves, on the field of two charged bodies, and on the interaction of spinning particles. In 1964 he published \\"The Mystery of the Expanding Universe\\", a popular book on cosmology. Bonnor remained scientifically active long after his retirement, averaging around two papers a year in his last 30 years, and had a paper under review at the time of his death.William Bonnor LMS Newsletter Obituary In 1999, at the age of 78, he showed that in some cosmological models the expansion of space-time affects the size of hydrogen atoms, while in others it remains strictly constant.Bonnor, W.B., 1999.

Space Shuttle Max is a Vekoma Boomerang coaster. It has a single train with seven cars, with 2 rows per car and 2 seats per row. The train is capable of carrying a maximum of 28 passengers. It is inspired by sci-fi films and the NASA space program of the 60's. This 11-story roller coaster inverts riders six times - three times forward and three times backward. This is the first coaster ride of its kind in the country. This ride was originally called the 'Cobra' and it was located at West Midland Safari and Leisure Park in Bewdley, England from 1985 to 1991. Ride elements *Lift hill *Cobra roll *Loop Ride layout The ride begins when the train is pulled backwards from the station and up a 116.5 ft lift spike, before being released. After being released, the train passes through the station, enters a Cobra roll element (referred to as a boomerang by the designers), then travels through a vertical loop. Upon exiting the loop, the train runs up a second spike, which is angled so that the two spikes meet at the top in a \\"V\\"-like formation. Once the train runs out of momentum, it is lifted to the top of the second spike via chain lift, and is held for several seconds before being released; travelling through the layout in reverse before returning being finally coming to a complete stop in the station.  Incidents  In December 2007, Space Shuttle had an incident when the train stalled on the Cobra Roll element of the ride. There were 25 riders during the incident which were mostly students from Batangas on an educational tour. There were no serious injuries among the students.

Their grandson, also called Jean, fought for Ren√©, the Duke of Lorraine in the war against Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. In revenge, Charles completely destroyed the Castle of Pettingen whose treasures were confiscated by the Governor of Luxembourg in 1494. However, as a result of a decree made at the Great Council of Mechelen in 1503, half of the treasures were returned and the castle was reconstructed in its present form.

Career The group's origins were in North London in 1960, as a backing group for club singer Lennie Peters. Its members at that time included pianist Gil Lucas (born Gilbert James Lucas, 20 September 1936, Kensington, South West London) and bass player Lenny Blanche (born Leonard Frederick Arthur Blanche, 1 June 1936, Woolwich, South East London). Various people - including, on occasions, Peters' nephew Charlie Watts, later of the Rolling Stones - stood in as drummer, until the position was filled more permanently by Mike Felix (born Michael Felix Staples, 18 February 1940, London). After Peters left for a solo career - going on to chart success in the 1970s as one half of Peters and Lee - Felix became the lead singer, and the group recruited guitarist Stan \\"Red\\" Lambert (born Stanley Frank Lambert, September 24, 1937?, London). They named themselves The Migil Four, drawing on the names of Mike Felix and Gilbert Lucas. Biography by Bruce Eder, Allmusic.com The group played a mixture of pop, R&B; and jazz music on the cabaret circuit until they were seen by trad jazz bandleader Kenny Ball. He performed onstage with them, and recommended them to his record label, Pye Records. Their first single, \\"Maybe\\", was released in 1963. They then added tenor saxophonist Alan \\"Earl\\" Watson (born Alan Michael Watson, 8 July 1940, Forest Gate, East London), formerly a member of Georgie Fame's Blue Flames, so becoming The Migil 5, and won a residency at the Tottenham Royal dance hall, replacing the Dave Clark Five. Expanding their repertoire to cater for a younger audience, they recorded their second single, \\"Mockin' Bird Hill\\" - a country song which had been a US hit for Les Paul and Mary Ford - in a style then known as \\"bluebeat\\" and later as ska. It was released the same week as Millie Small's ska hit \\"My Boy Lollipop\\", and entered the UK Singles Chart in March 1964, rising to #10. It also reached number one in Ireland. According to Bruce Eder at Allmusic: > \\"The Migil Five were an improbable outfit on the early-'60s London rock > music scene. Five guys who were already in their late '20s and skilled in > jazz, R&B;, blues, folk, and pop, Lambert was balding and sported a beard > and the others looked more like veterans of the '50s trad jazz scene. Watson > brought a harder R&B; sound that made them more appealing to teenagers, but > they all looked more like music teachers than rock & rollers.\\" Their follow-up single, \\"Near You\\", reached #31 on the UK chart, and the band released an album in 1964, Mockin' Bird Hill. They appeared on television, and in two movie features, Swinging U.K. and U.K. Swings Again, later put together as Go Go Big Beat. Subsequent singles and an EP, Meet the Migil Five, failed to make the British charts, although the group remained popular in Ireland.

It allows trains to run from Leeds, Newcastle and Middlesbrough direct to Manchester Airport and stations on the main line to London Euston. A chord was proposed in the late-1970s and parliamentary powers for its construction were received in 1979, but the project was cancelled. Network Rail revived the proposal in 2010 as part of its Northern Hub proposal. Funding for its construction totalling ¬£85 million was announced in the 2011 United Kingdom budget and construction commenced in 2016. It became operational on 10 December 2017. However its use since becoming operational has been limited as no additional capacity at Victoria, Oxford Road and Piccadilly has been built to cope with more through services. Background By the late 20th century, the rail network in Manchester could not support demand. The main stations at Piccadilly and Victoria were not linked and many trains terminated at Victoria taking up excessive platform space. One solution, the Picc-Vic tunnel between the stations, was proposed in the 1970s but rejected on cost grounds in 1977. A curve at Ordsall linking Piccadilly to Victoria was proposed in the late 1970s when it was known as the Castlefield Curve after the nearby district. A bill relating to its proposed construction was debated in the House of Commons in June 1979, receiving some support but it was opposed on the grounds that a tunnel would provide a better alternative. By the end of the year, British Rail had received parliamentary powers to construct the line. It was estimated to cost around ¬£10 million but following opposition from local politicians and a shortage of funding, the project was never started. By 1985 it had been abandoned. The proposal was included in a draft Network Rail report in 2005 as a solution to overcrowding in the region, at an expected cost of ¬£44 million. In February 2010, the project was revived by Network Rail as part of the Manchester Hub Study, with the intention of receiving government funding by around 2014. On 23 March 2011 George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced ¬£85 million funding for the scheme in the 2011 budget. The announcement was unexpected and was welcomed by the Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority. Proposal The Ordsall Chord provides a direct link between Piccadilly and Victoria stations, allowing trains from Manchester Victoria and the east to continue to Piccadilly. Following completion of the chord, in theory four trains per hour will travel between Manchester Airport/Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria in each direction, and associated reorganisation of train paths and retimetabling will provide eight trains per hour from Manchester Victoria towards the west via Chat Moss, and six trains per hour from Manchester Piccadilly towards either Chat Moss or Bolton and Preston (trains from both Victoria and Piccadilly stations to the west and north west (Chat Moss, Liverpool, Bolton, Preston, etc.) do not actually pass over the Ordsall Chord, both ends of which lead eastwards, but travel over pre-existing track).Ordsall Chord Project Scoping Report, Network Rail, February 2012. Section 2.2.8, page 6 The chord is part of the larger Northern Hub project, proposed by Network Rail in the Manchester Hub Study of 2010. The complete scheme would cost around ¬£530 million to implement. The Ordsall Chord will cost ¬£85 million and will allow around 700 extra trains per day to operate into Manchester. Most through trains on TransPennine Express (TPE) routes to , and will be re-routed via Victoria rather than Piccadilly but some TPE services to Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle will continue to run via Piccadilly and will stop at and/or and . The current fast North TransPennine services will operate via Victoria reducing journey times. The full scheme includes new through platforms at Piccadilly and track improvements outside Manchester to allow fast expresses to overtake slower stopping trains, reducing journey times to Leeds by 14 minutes on average and to Liverpool by 17. Railfreight access to yards in the Trafford Park area will be improved. Construction of the Ordsall Chord in October 2016 The chord will preserve connectivity between the relocated East-West services and the city's main rail interchange at Manchester Piccadilly. It will improve access to Manchester Airport which cannot be reached easily from Victoria. Without the chord, such operations would require trains to be run to and then reverse. Concern was raised about the impact the scheme will have on the historic Grade I listed 1830 railway bridge over the River Irwell, part of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway's original approach to Manchester Liverpool Road railway station, (now the site of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester (MOSI)), which lies in the path of construction.Ordsall Chord Initial Environmental Information, page 6, Ordsall Chord project page, Network Rail.

The statutory instrument authorising construction was made on 31 March 2015, and preparatory works began in October 2015. In January 2016, Network Rail began work on the foundations with a planned completion date of late 2017. In November 2016, Network Rail announced they expected services to run to Manchester Airport from December 2017 and electric trains to run between Manchester and Preston via Bolton with new connections into Manchester from the Calder Valley. 2018 will see the introduction of an hourly direct service from Newcastle to Manchester Airport, which will also mean an extra hourly service between Leeds and Newcastle, and six trains an hour between Manchester Victoria and Rochdale. Mark Whitby, civil engineer and former President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, appealed against the decision to approve its construction in the High Court. On 14 October 2015, the High Court rejected his appeal and denied Whitby the right to appeal the decision. Whitby did appeal and on 11 January 2016, the Court of Appeal granted Leave to Appeal saying \\"The grounds of appeal raise important points and have real prospects of success\\". Whitby wanted an alternative that would not sever the main-line rail connection to the Museum of Science and Industry nor destroy heritage structures. The case was heard in March 2016 but Whitby's appeal was rejected. The 600-tonne network arch was lifted into place on 21 February 2017. Operation The first passenger service was at 08:40 on 10 December 2017: Manchester Victoria to Manchester Oxford Road followed by the return service continuing to Leeds. It was envisaged that congestion at Manchester Piccadilly would reduce by a quarter, in part due to the reduced need for trains to cross the throat of the station, blocking other services. It was hoped there would be more frequent train services through Manchester. However this has not yet materialised, particularly after the May 2018 timetable which created widespread disruption around Manchester. The Ordsall Chord's lack of use in comparison to its ¬£100 million cost has been attributed to a lack of capacity at Piccadilly, Oxford Road and Victoria to cope with increased 'through' services that the Chord generates.

Pearson Profile on scrum.com He was described as late as 1925 as \\"about as f√≠ne a full back as ever played\\", and was the first Australian born rugby union international. Early life and family Alexander William Pearson was born in 1854 as the son of Captain James Pearson by his second marriage to Augusta Sarah Godfrey. Alexander's father, James, had been born on 12 June 1799 in Furris, Kincardine, Scotland, himself the son of Peter Patrick and Elizabeth (n√©e Pride) Pearson. Having worked in a Liverpool shipping office James ran away to sea, voyaging to China and India and by the age of 29 was the Captain of the 'Lady of the Lake\\", chartered by the British Government in March 1829 to deliver a consignment of female prisoners to Hobart, Van Diemens Land. Captain Pearson stayed in the colony of New South Wales, and met and married Jane Mackey of Sydney at St. James Church, Sydney on 27 June 1835. The following April, Alec's older half brother Jamie was born, but died of dysentery before reaching 6 months of age. Then on 27 March 1838, on older half sister, Janet, was born, and christened in Calcutta. The following year, in Perth, a third older half-brother was born in November. However, James was widowed shortly afterward as Jane died on 25 November 1839 and a few days later on 3 December James' newborn son also died. Alec's only remaining half-sibling from his father's first marriage, Janet, also died an infant, in June 1841. Having lost his entire family, James resumed his voyaging and at the end of 1842, undertook a Leasing Arrangement in Melbourne in the Parish of Kalkallo, on the crest of Kinlochewe Hill. On 30 June 1846, James married Augusta Sarah Godfrey, the daughter of John Race Godfrey, a Royal Navy captain. The marriage took place at St. Petrox Church, Dartmouth, Devon. Immediately, the couple began preparations to sail to Port Phillip District, along with Augusta's 18-year-old cousin Frederick Race Godfrey (1826‚Äì1910). Augusta was pregnant on the voyage and in Port Philip Alec's older sister, Augusta Janet, was born on 12 April 1847. Captain Pearson then purchased a total holding of 1547 acres in the parish of Yuroke. He also bought his previously leased Kinloch Hill property and renamed the geographical feature \\"Mt. Ridley\\" after a rocky outcrop behind Augusta's family house in Dartmouth, Devonshire. On 22 August 1848, Alec's older brother, James Godfrey Pearson was born in Melbourne. In April 1850, another older brother, Freddy, was born in Melbourne. However he died on 3 March 1851. Emily Lillias was born, on 24 December 1851. In 1854 Alexander William was born at Mount Ridley, the first of the children to be born at the house. The following year his younger sister, Caroline Maria Josephine was born. In 1858 the Pearsons left for England to educate their sons, as was the common practice for pastoralists. During their time in England, two more of Alec's siblings were born, David Chambers Pearson in 1860, and Blanche Alice in 1862, both in Suffolk, England whilst the family were residing at Hemingstone Hall, Needham Market, Suffolk. Alec and his older brother were educated at the Blackheath Proprietary School, London, from 1864 to 1869.J. W. Kirby, History of the Blackheath Proprietary School, 1933 From 1873 he was registered as a first year student at Guy‚Äôs Hospital. However, that there is no account of his having paid his fees nor are there records of his having attended any courses or entering any examinations. Another English international, fellow member at Blackheath and contemporary of Alec at Guy's, Dr Lennard Stokes, wrote that Perason \\"never did any work at Guy's and only entered to play in the cup ties\\".Guy's Gazette, 1923 Rugby union career Alec Pearson played rugby for Guy's hospital from 1873 to 1877, his first match being in the 1873/1874 season against the Clapham Rovers. In this season he was selected to take part in the All-England trial games in February 1874. He was also key in Guy's win over St George's Hospital in the first ever f√≠nal of the Hospitals Cup in 1875. In this period, his loyalty appeared to be with Guy's as he played for them against Blackheath in March 1875, whilst his brother played for Blackheath. However, at other points in the season he also played for Blackheath, which having been originally set up as a team to represent old boys from Blackheath Proprietary School, was a natural choice for him. In 1877 though, in a later Guy's vs Blackheath confrontation, he played for Blackheath. When not playing for Guy's Alec was known to have not only assisted Blackheath as a player but also became Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the club in 1875‚Äì76, 76‚Äì77 and 1877‚Äì78.Guy's Gazette, Bicentenary edition, 1925 He played 14 games for Blackheath in 1877/78 and then left for Australia in the 1880s to farm his family estate, his brother having already left for Australia in 1875. As an international, he made his debut on 15 February 1875 at The Oval in the England vs Ireland match. and his final appearance for England on 11 March 1878 at Lansdowne Road in the Ireland vs England match. His contemporary, Lennard Stokes, in 1925 described Alec Pearson as \\"about as f√≠ne a full back as ever played, beautiful drop and place kick and dead sure tackle\\". Later life Alexander returned to Australia to run the 'Mt. Ridley\\" and \\"Wheatlands\\" property. His mother's cousin, Frederick Race Godfrey, had leased the property from 1858 to 1875, and in 1875 James Godfrey Pearson the eldest son of the Captain returned to Australia, later joined by Alec.

It is situated 40 km south of Budapest, on the island of Csepel, in the center of the little town of R√°ckeve ().  History  According to a preserved tradition, often neglected, this monastery has a medieval heritage and appeared in the first half of the 12th century. Queen Helena, the daughter of the Prefect of Ra≈°ka Uro≈° I, and the wife of Hungarian king Bela II the Blind is mentioned as the founder of the monastery. At the time when the monastery was founded Hungary was being ruled by Helena instead of her underage son, Geza II (1141‚Äì1161).() Vojislav Matiƒá: Pravoslavni manstir Srpski Kovin, Platoneum, Novi Sad 2009. After the Turks had besieged and for the first time conquered Smederevo Fortress in 1439, they crossed the Danube on two occasions and devastated and robbed Kovin and all surrounding villages. Those who escaped moved to the inland of Hungary and reached to the island of Csepel on the Danube. On October 10, 1440, Hungarian king Vladislav gave to the Kovin migrants the Early Gothic style church with chapels and bell tower, and with it, presumably, the corresponding part of the royal landholdings. From that time on, there is on Csepel, Upper () or Serbian () Kovin, with the church dedicated to the Dormition of Mother of God with the chapels of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist and St. Unmercenary Physicians and Wonderworkers Cosmas and Damian (the first on the southeast, the second on the southwest side). Abbot Andrej Panduroviƒá There is a possibility that in the years around the half of the 16th century the parish church was transformed into the monastery. There is no direct evidence for this conclusion, but in the Turkish census of 1546 three monks and a priest were recorded in Serbian Kovin, that indicates the possibility that, along with the church, the monastery was already there. The (so far) reliable data from 1680 confirms the existence of the monastery on the island of Csepel. As part of the reduction of the monasteries in the time of Maria Theresa, the Serbian Kovin monastery was abolished in 1777 and the small monastic brotherhood, probably led by Archimandrite Josif Stanojeviƒá, moved to the monastery of Grabovac and the Serbian Kovin church was turned into a parish. After more than two centuries, this great shrine of Serbs in Hungary again gained the status of the monastery, led by Abbot Andrej Panduroviƒá.  Architecture  Royal door Initially, at the end of the 13th century, the church was a larger one-nave Early Gothic style building of rectangular base shape, dimensions of about 10 x 25 meters and with a useful floor area of about 175 m2. In the massive hewn stone walls, about 90 cm thick, there were two portals, nine two-part windows and 16 supporting pillars. Approximately from the same period dates the isolated belfry on the east side, built of hewn stone, is now preserved in the ground and first floors. Its basic size ( 7,40 X 7,20 m ), the thickness of its walls about 2,50 m and a small usable area indicate the depth of its foundations to two meters and its height of about 50 meters with a narrow pyramidal cap on top. In the time after the year of 1440, after the church had been given to the Serbs, the harmonious and proportionate Gothic building ( with the chapels ) was, with minor interventions, turned into the Orthodox oratory. The eastern aisle, trigonously completed, was renovated and converted into the altar area of appropriate size. Without a doubt, the original iconostasis in the obtained church was a low altar screen with a small number of icons brought from Kovin in Banat. Today's iconostasis with a smaller number of icons dates from 1770. Only four main icons were painted earlier, in 1746, and present the work of unknown Russian and Ukrainian masters. Other icons, including those in unusual places below the main ones, belong to the masters from Moshopolis. This \\"developed\\" altar screen has several horizontal zones. The first is a parapet one and unpainted. The second comprises the Royal Doors with 14 medallions of Prophets, side doors with icons above them and finally the main icons with the elongated medallions in the foot. In the final fourth zone there are the cross with the crucifixion, two associated icons and the icons of Apostles in the carved frames. On the foundations of an earlier, probably collapsed tower, there was built the Baroque part of the bell tower in 1756 in two floor level with the high decorative cap on top. Together with the earlier levels the belfry has a ground floor, three floors and a cap of timber coated with copper sheeting. The height of the masonry part of the belfry is 26,10 m, the height of the decorative cap (with the apple and the cross is 14,30 m while the overall height is 40,40 meters. Observed in the context of the Serbian Baroque architecture, the belfry belongs to the group of rare towers completely separated from the church.  Frescoes  Virgin Mary and her parents The inscription on a bronze plate embedded into the southern wall of the narthex says that the church was painted three times ‚Äì in 1320 ( of which there are no surviving traces ), then in 1514 ( as for those paintings one can see only a fragment of the image of Virgin Mary with Christ under the parts of plaster from 1765 that fell off ) and the last time in 1765. The inscription above the southern door leading from the church into the chapel of St. John the Baptist, also tells about wall painting of the church on three occasions. In the side chapels the wall paintings were made in 1771, as can be read in the inscription.() Sreten Petkoviƒá: ≈Ωivopis crkve Uspenja u Srpskom Kovinu ( Rackeve-u ) , Zbornik Matice srpske za dru≈°tvene nauke 23, Novi Sad 1959. The wall paintings in the Church of the Dormition of Mother of God and its two chapels in Serbian Kovin were painted by artists led by Teodor Simeonov from Moshopolis.

Since the church is done in the Gothic style, the iconographer faced a difficult task to develop the scenes in the manner of the old Byzantine and Serbian church painting placing them in the Gothic divided sections of the walls. The whole main church as well as the chapels, from the ground up to the top of the Gothic vaults, among the intertwined pillars, according to the proportion of space that up in the arches gets narrower, are symmetrically filled with frescoes of saints and Serbian rulers and saints. The joints of the columns are nicely combined and covered with smaller images of the Evangelists, Apostles, Martyrs, Angels and Archangels. In the lower parts of the walls, between the vertical columns, the Serbian rulers, from Nemanja to Emperor Uro≈° and Prince Lazar, are aligned in their actual size. The fresco in the south wall, in the doorpost of the passage between the chapel of St. John the Baptist and the main church, painted in 1765, in which Joachim and Anna prayerfully address the Virgin, is an interesting and remarkable phenomenon in Serbian painting. The scene resembles the composition of Deisis, but the Virgin and her parents appear as protagonists.() Ljiljana ≈†evo: Jedna neuobiƒçajena tema u srpskom slikarstvu ‚Äì Bogorodica izmeƒëu Joakima i Ane u crkvi Uspenja Bogorodice u Srpskom Kovinu , Ni≈° i vizantija, Zbornik radova, Ni≈° 2007.

It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle. According to Field, bullies are attracted to the caring professions, such as medicine, by the opportunities to exercise power over vulnerable clients, employees and students. While the stereotype of a victim as a weak person who somehow deserves to be bullied is salient, there is growing evidence that bullies, who are often driven by jealousy and envy, pick on the highest performing and most skilled students, whose mere presence is sufficient to make the bully feel insecure. The victim are usually high academic achievers and are likely to have been top of the class throughout their school years. As medical students have to compete against each other, this can make certain trainee doctors eager to stand out from the crowd, and some use underhand techniques to gain academic recognition. The rampant problem of medical student mistreatment and bullying was systematically studied and reported in a 1990 JAMA study by pediatrician Henry K. Silver which found that 46.4 percent of students at one medical school had been abused at some point during medical school; by the time they were seniors, that number was 80.6 percent. In a 2002 test, 594 BMA members were randomly selected to complete a bullying survey, and 220 of the 594 junior doctors reported having been bullied in the previous year. This survey reported no variance in job grade or age. Psychology Threats (of exposure of inadequacy) must be ruthlessly controlled and subjugated. Psychological models such as transference and projection have been proposed to explain such behaviors, wherein the bully's sense of personal inadequacy is projected or transferred to a victim; through making others feel inadequate and subordinate, the bully thus vindicates their own sense of inferiority. Displacement is another defense mechanism that can explain the propensity of many medical educators to bully students, and may operate subconsciously. Displacement entails the redirection of an impulse (usually aggression) onto a powerless substitute target. The target can be a person or an object that can serve as a symbolic substitute. Displacement can operate in chain-reactions, wherein people unwittingly become at once victims and perpetrators of displacement. For example, a resident physician may be undergoing stress with her patients or at home, but cannot express these feelings toward patients or toward her family members, so she channels these negative emotions toward vulnerable students in the form of intimidation, control or subjugation. The student then acts brashly toward a patient, channeling reactive emotions which cannot be directed back to the resident physician onto more vulnerable subjects. Beyond its ramifications for victims, disrespect and bullying in medicine is a threat to patient safety because it inhibits collegiality and cooperation essential to teamwork, cuts off communication, undermines morale, and inhibits compliance with and implementation of new practices. =Bullying cycle= Medical training usually takes place in institutions that have a highly structured hierarchical system, and has traditionally involved teaching by intimidation and humiliation. Such practices may foster a culture of bullying and the setting up of a cycle of bullying, analogous to other cycles of abuse in which those who experience it go on to abuse others when they become more senior. Medical doctors are increasingly reporting to the British Medical Association that they are being bullied, often by older and more senior colleagues, many of whom were badly treated themselves when more junior.Williams K (1998) Stress linked to bullying. BMA News Review, April 18 Physician Jonathan Belsey relates in an emblematic narrative published in AMA Virtual Mentor entitled Teaching By Humiliation that \\"however well you presented the case, somewhere along the line you would trip up and give the predatory professor his opportunity to expose your inadequacies. Sometimes it would be your lack of medical knowledge; sometimes the question that you failed to ask the patient that would have revealed the root of the problem, or sometimes your ineptitude at eliciting the required clinical signs. On one memorable occasion, when I had appeared to cover all the bases clinically, the professor turned to me and berated me for attending his ward round wearing a plaid shirt that was clearly inappropriate for an aspiring doctor.\\" Impact Bullying can significantly decrease job satisfaction and increase job-induced stress; it also leads to low self-confidence, depression, anxiety and a desire to leave employment. Bullying contributes to high rates of staff turnover, high rates of sickness absence, impaired performance, lower productivity, poor team spirit and loss of trained staff. This has implications for the recruitment and retention of medical staff. Chronic and current bullying are associated with substantially worse health, according to research by Laura M. Bogart, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Studies have consistently shown that physicians have had the highest depression and suicide rates compared to people in many other lines of work‚Äîfor suicide, 40% higher for male physicians and 130% higher for female physicians. Research has traced the beginning of this difference to the years spent in medical school. Students enter medical school with mental health profiles similar to those of their peers but end up experiencing depression, burnout, suicidal ideation and other mental illnesses at much higher rates. Despite better access to health care, they are more likely to cope by resorting to dysfunctional and self- injurious behaviors, and are less likely to receive the right care or even recognize that they need some kind of intervention. Exposure to bullying and intimidation during formative years of medical training has been found to contribute to these consequences. Fear of stigmatisation among medical students was the subject of a study in JAMA by Thomas Schwenk and colleagues at the University of Michigan's Department of Family Medicine, MI, USA. 53% of medical students who reported high levels of depressive symptoms were worried that revealing their illness would be risky for their careers and 62% said asking for help would mean their coping skills were inadequate, according to the study published in September 2010. \\"Medical students are under extraordinary demands. They feel they are making life and death decisions and that they can never be wrong. There is such tremendous pressure to be perfect that any sense of falling short makes them very anxious\\", says Schwenk. Types=Medical students= Medical students, perhaps being vulnerable because of their relatively low status in health care settings, may experience verbal abuse, humiliation and harassment (nonsexual or sexual). Discrimination based on gender and race are less common. In one study, around 35% of medical students reported having been bullied. Around one in four of the 1,000 students questioned said they had been bullied by a medical doctor. Furthermore, bullying has been known to occur among medical students. Manifestations of bullying include:Curtis P Medical students complain of bullying The Guardian 4 May 2005 * being humiliated by teachers in front of patients or peers * been victimised for not having come from a \\"medical family\\" (often people who enter medicine have an older sibling pursuing the same degree or share ties with other individuals in the profession with whom familial relationship confers some degree of protection or special influence ‚Äì especially within academic settings.) Such practices extend to admissions procedures, which are regularly influenced by factors far afield of candidates' intrinsic merits, such as being related to faculty members or well-known medical luminaries. * being put under pressure to carry out a procedure without supervision. * being ostracized by other medical students for asking questions (due to the medical content being confusing for some students) through social media networks (Facebook bullying), phone, or in person. One study showed that the medical faculty was the faculty in which students were most commonly mistreated. Bullying extends to postgraduate students. =Junior (trainee) physicians= In a UK study, 37% of junior doctors reported being bullied in the previous year and 84% had experienced at least one bullying incident. Black and Asian physicians were more likely to be bullied than other physicians. Women were more likely to be bullied than men. Trainee physicians who feel threatened in the clinical workplace develop less effectively and are less likely to ask for advice or help when they need it. Persistent destructive criticism, sarcastic comments and humiliation in front of colleagues will cause all but the most resilient of trainees to lose confidence in themselves. Consultants who feel burnt out and alienated may take their disaffection out on junior colleagues. The farewell interview from Sir Ian Kennedy (Chair of the Healthcare Commission) caused significant media interest following his statement that bullying is a 'corrosive' problem that the NHS must address. =Psychiatry= Psychiatric trainees experience rates of bullying at least as high as other medical students. In a survey of psychiatric trainees in the West Midlands, 47% had experienced bullying within the last year with even higher percentages amongst ethnic minorities and females. Qualified psychiatrists are not themselves required to be psychiatrically assessed.Gadit AA Bullying in psychiatry must stop ‚Äì Clinical Psychiatry News, May, 2007 =Patients and nurses= There have been quite a few proven cases of doctors bullying and/or sexually harassing patients and nurses.Doctor faces court-martial in patient abuse case Stars and Stripes January 16, 2010'Groping' surgeon found guilty BBC News 28 July 2002 Speaking of many doctors' predilection for bullying nurses, Theresa Brown writes: > ...the most damaging bullying is not flagrant and does not fit the > stereotype of a surgeon having a tantrum in the operating room. It is > passive, like not answering pages or phone calls, and tends toward the > subtle: condescension rather than outright abuse, and aggressive or > sarcastic remarks rather than straightforward insults. =Nursing= Nurses experience bullying quite frequently. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossiping and intimidation) are commonplace. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.Richards A, Edwards SL A Nurse's Survival Guide to the Ward (2008) Popular culture Sir Lancelot Spratt, a character played by actor James Robertson Justice in the film series Doctor in the House, is often referenced as the archetypal arrogant bullying doctor ruling by fear. The film series also demonstrates bullying of student doctors by other doctors and the nursing matron. In the American sitcom Scrubs, Dr. Cox uses intimidation and sarcasm as methods of tormenting the interns and expressing his dislike towards them and their company.

Her pioneering work at Mount Buffalo from the 1890s to the 1930s led to her becoming a tourist attraction in her own right, and helped lead to the establishment of the Mount Buffalo National Park.  Early life  Alice was born on the Manfield property, Nailsea Farm, in the Buckland Valley southeast of Mount Buffalo, in 1878, one of eight children born to James Manfield and his wife Jane. An experienced coal miner, James arrived in Victoria with his brother John in 1854 from Nailsea, Somerset, England joining the population boom during the Victorian gold rush. They made their way to the goldfields in the Buckland Valley, and later purchased a property there with the proceeds of their gold mining. Still chasing gold, they travelled to New Zealand and New South Wales, but within ten years had returned to the Buckland Valley to concentrate on working their farm. Pulpit Rock, Mount Buffalo, by Guide Alice (the figure in the photo is also thought to be Alice) Despite being over from Melbourne, Mount Buffalo was recognised for its special geology and botany by the likes of the noted Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, and started to attract a small flow of tourists. The extension of the railway to Myrtleford in 1883, then on to Bright in 1890, meant that in less than eight hours travellers from the capital could be within reach of Mt Buffalo. Locals began to see the tourism opportunities. In 1888 a tender was issued to build a hotel at the start of a new track up the mountain, and Alice's father James Manfield won. In 1890 Manfield's Buffalo Falls Temperance Hotel was opened at the foot of the mountain, with the Manfields providing the guests with transport between the hotel and Porepunkah station. James, or one of his children, would then lead energetic guests on the three-hour climb to the Buffalo plateau, where they could explore or camp out. In December 1890 one of the early visitors to the hotel was the then 25-year-old future war hero General Sir John Monash, who reported the hotel to be \\"in a very unfinished state, and little furnished\\", but he also recognised its potential. Returning a year later, Monash stated that the hotel was now \\"the height of comfort\\". Monash returned to Buffalo many more times over the years, always engaging the Manfields for guides and equipment. Although only about twelve years old when the hotel opened, Alice was regularly involved in the expeditions around the mountain, thereby developing a love and extensive knowledge of the flora, fauna, and rugged Mount Buffalo landscape.  Guide Alice  A tourist advertisement for Guide Alice from the early 1900s Manfield with packhorses carrying wooden chairs up the mountain Manfield soon became involved in leading tours up the mountain herself, and became widely and fondly known as Guide Alice. In the early days the only access to the subalpine Buffalo plateau was by a rough unsigned track accessible only by walking or on horseback, and there was only rudimentary accommodation and no signposting on the plateau itself. Guide Alice served as a calming influence to the burgeoning tourist numbers concerned about the wildlife, dangers on the mountain, and being lost. The Manfields soon built a second hotel, a small timber chalet built near Bents Lookout on the plateau itself, and gave it the affectionate name of Granny's Place. Alice eventually took over the running of Granny's Place, happy to spend long periods of time alone there, and regarding as \\"thrilling adventures\\" such events as bushfires, severe storms, and snow up to deep, at which time the chalet had to be entered via the chimney. = Equipment = With limited equipment available at the time for outdoor activities, and almost nothing designed specifically for women, Manfield designed her own gear. Although she sometimes dressed in a skirt, Manfield controversially wore pant suits for the cold conditions experienced in her job, long before this would become common clothing for women. Her pant suit consisted of a type of woollen bloomers or knickerbockers, and a high-necked buttoned jacket pulled in tightly around the waist. This was accompanied by puttees tightly wrapped around her calves, a low-heeled leather walking boot, a beanie, and a long walking pole. = National park = Manfield impressed visitors with her enthusiasm and extensive knowledge of Mount Buffalo. With her skills as a naturalist and photographer, she became a sought-after guide. Her passion for the mountain, and the novelty of her being a female guide, led to Manfield herself becoming a tourist attraction, helping to add to the popularity of the mountain. Following local activism, in 1898 the Victorian government declared of land on the plateau as Mount Buffalo National Park. In 1908 a road was opened to the plateau. In a predominantly male gathering, Guide Alice was photographed holding the ribbon at the road's official opening as the Premier of Victoria, Sir Thomas Bent, prepared to cut it. With the road leading to increased tourism, in 1910 the Public Works Department built a government owned guesthouse close by the Manfield's chalet. The new government chalet appealed more to passive tourists, while chalets owned by the Manfields and another local family, the Carlile family, were better suited to those wanting a more basic and adventurous experience. = Later years = Despite the declaration of the national park and the coming of the road, Guide Alice's services remained in demand, and she continued in the role of mountain guide. Distinguished visitors called on her, including the likes of David Syme, proprietor of The Age newspaper, landscape artist Sir Arthur Streeton, and Sir John Monash. Manfield retired from guiding during the 1930s, when she would have been in her fifties, and died in 1960 at eighty-two. = Publications = In 1924 Manfield released The Lyre-Birds of Mount Buffalo, a 23-page volume detailing her studies into the lyrebirds on Mount Buffalo. This volume featured Manfield's own photography and had an introduction by Charles Barrett, C.M.Z.S. This was the first pictorial record of lyrebirds to be released.  Personal life  Manfield married a distant cousin, John Edmund Manfield, a ranger with the Parks Service, in 1917. They had one child, a daughter named Genevieve Baumgarten.

History  Sea Turtles 911 was founded by Frederick Yeh, who discovered that there were no longer nesting populations of sea turtles on the beaches of Hainan island as he once remembered from his childhood. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Yeh returned to China to promote sea turtle conservation in a region where sea turtles are still being hunted for their meat and shell. Some locals in Hainan now call him \\"Haigui\\" or \\"the returning sea turtle.\\" = Facility and Location = At the floating sea turtle hospital, volunteers return sea turtle patient into her net enclosure after administering medical treatments. To quell the demand for sea turtle meat and products, Sea Turtles 911 initially began focusing on public awareness campaigns within the tourist resort city of Sanya, China, located on the southern tip of Hainan island. In order to raise awareness with local fishermen and rescue turtles, a sea turtle hospital was built in a floating fishing village in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, where the sea turtle black market was thriving. The organization's sea turtle hospital is a unique facility in that it is actually floating on the ocean water. At the floating sea turtle hospital, sick and injured sea turtles are rehabilitated and recover inside large net enclosures, which are suspended by ropes tied to the deck above. Fishing villages all along the coast of Hainan likely contain many thousands of sea turtles in the hands of poachers. Despite the prevalence of poaching in the local fishing community, some local fishermen have befriended Sea Turtles 911 and Chinese coast guard police frequently assist in rescuing sea turtles from the hands of local poachers. = Sea Turtle Use in China = Due to a thriving market demand for sea turtle meat, eggs, and other shell products, a sign of status and wealth and believed to promote health and longevity, sea turtles are nearing extinction in Chinese waters. Poached sea turtles include endangered Green sea turtles raised primarily for consumption of their meat, and the critically endangered Hawksbill sea turtle raised for the trade in their shell products such as jewelry, combs, and the frames of eyeglasses. Due to the over harvest of turtles in Chinese waters, it is believed increasing numbers of poachers are crossing international borders to illegally hunt sea turtles in the Philippines. The trade of sea turtle meat and products is illegal in China as well as internationally.  Activism  Medical treatments are provided to rehabilitate sick and injured sea turtles. Sea Turtles 911's mission is based on the 5 R's: Rescue, Rehabilitate, Release, Research, Raise. # Rescue ‚Äì sea turtles are rescued from poachers who capture and raise sea turtles for meat and shell products. # Rehabilitate ‚Äì sea turtles that are rescued are often in need of medical attention for injuries, illnesses, and malnourishment. # Release ‚Äì the ultimate goal for all injured sea turtles is eventual release back into their ocean home. Turtle release events are organized to raise public awareness. # Research ‚Äì conservation research projects, such as tagging, sheds light into what happens to the sea turtles after releasing them into the ocean, so conservation efforts can be focused in the areas where turtles nest, forage, breed, and migrate. # Raise ‚Äì through public events, outreach initiatives, ecotourism programs, and mass media, raising public awareness to educate people on the importance of sea turtles and how they can help save them, is vital to the success of sea turtle conservation. Volunteers educate underprivileged children on sea turtle conservation. Sea Turtles 911 addresses conservation issues by educating the public and tourists about the many threats to sea turtles, encouraging people to discontinue consuming sea turtle meat and purchasing jewelry and items made from the shells of sea turtles. Partnerships are also formed with local resorts, such as the Ritz- Carlton, Sanya, to educate hotel guests and their children about the importance of sea turtles to the environment. In the Ritz's Giveback Getaway Program, tourists are invited to visit the floating hospital to meet the sea turtle patients, volunteer, and learn about sea turtle biology and conservation. Sea Turtles 911 works closely with local fishermen to encourage the conservation and release of Whale sharks caught as by-catch by Chinese fishing boats. The organization also partners with universities in Haikou, the capital city of Hainan, by bringing students from Hainan Normal University and Hainan University into the organization to conduct research and educational programs. = Major Events = A sea turtle with a satellite tracker is released from a coast guard police boat to advance conservation research. On January 7, 2011, the Ritz-Carlton and Sea Turtles 911 held a public sea turtle release event in which 7 sea turtles were released, in cooperation with Dr. Nicolas Pilcher, Co-Chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Marine Turtle Specialist Group. On May 31, 2011, Sea Turtles 911 volunteers were assisted by local police in the release of a fully rehabilitated green sea turtle back into the ocean following treatment for an injured flipper that was damaged by a fishing vessel propeller. On October 1, 2011, world-renowned turtle zoologist Dr. Peter Pritchard and China's top turtle expert Dr. Shi Hai Tao of Hainan Normal University joined with Sea Turtles 911 and coast guard police to release a Hawksbill sea turtle in Lingshui, Hainan. The following day, three Green sea turtles were released in Sanya, Hainan, after an educational presentation by Dr. Pritchard and Dr. Shi. On February 18, 2012, a tagged Green sea turtle was released at the Ritz- Carlton with George Balazs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). At this event, Sea Turtles 911 introduced Nemo to the public, a newly rehabilitated sea turtle found entangled in discarded fishing line, requiring amputation of his right front flipper. On March 27, 2012, in cooperation with coast guard police, an adult female Green turtle named Star Blue, was outfitted with a satellite transmitter tag and released. This marked the organization's first conservation research effort to discover and protect areas where sea turtles feed and nest in the South China Sea. NBA basketball star and China's top celebrity Yao Ming releases an endangered sea turtle back into the wild during a Sea Turtles 911 event to raise public awareness for environmental conservation. On May 27, 2012, in celebration of China's Children's Day, a juvenile Green turtle was released on Dadonghai Beach in Sanya, with the assistance of students from the National University of Singapore. On July 4, 2012, in partnership with Ocean Park Hong Kong and Hainan Normal University, a satellite tagged juvenile Whale shark was released along with two juvenile Green sea turtles, one of which was also satellite tagged. The event was hailed as a 'Freedom Release', coincidentally occurring on American Independence Day. On March 23, 2013, two Green turtles were released in commemoration of Earth Hour, the one hour when the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) encourages businesses and households worldwide to switch off their lights to raise awareness on climate change. Sea turtle eggs are influenced by a biological process known as Temperature-dependent sex determination, meaning that their gender is determined by the environmental temperature. Higher temperatures due to climate change result in an unbalanced sex ratio, threatening the long-term survival of marine turtles. On October 24, 2013, athletes from the Ladies European Tour (LET), China LPGA, and Ladies Asian Golf Tour, teed off by releasing two rescued sea turtles in Sanya, China; a Green sea turtle and a Hawksbill sea turtle. Champion Lee-Anne Pace, upon her 2013 LET triumph, continued to champion the cause of the endangered sea turtles by officially adopting a baby sea turtle hatchling, which she named, Jagger. On January 18, 2014, government officials from the United States and China released three rescued sea turtles during the opening ceremony of the Sea Turtle Shelter, an educational facility to raise public awareness on environmental conservation issues, while providing a temporary home for rehabilitated sea turtles.http://en.visithainan.gov.cn/EN/hotelview_2597.htm The event fostered a peaceful platform to improve China‚ÄìUnited States relations by focusing on the shared global mission of saving sea turtles from extinction. As U.S. Consul General Jennifer Galt said, ‚ÄúOur governments must continue to work together to develop policy and programs that protect our most precious resources, businesses must play an active role in responsible development, and groups like Sea Turtles 911 must continue to fight for protection of local resources like sea turtles through education and outreach.‚Äù On June 16, 2014, NBA player Yao Ming and his family joined Sea Turtles 911 to release rescued sea turtles back to nature. \\"I think it‚Äôs very important to raise awareness in our country about protecting wild animals and passing it on to our next generation like my daughter,\\" said Yao Ming. On October 30, 2014, during the Mission Hills golf tournament, Sea Turtles 911 presented NBA superstar Yao Ming with the World Sea Turtle Conservation Award. Yao Ming continued to raise awareness for marine turtle protection, saying, \\"Sea turtles have an important role in the balance of our ocean's ecosystem.\\" U.S. Ambassador to China and former U.S. Senator Max Baucus supports Sea Turtles 911 in the release of rescued turtles into the South China Sea. On June 8, 2015, five (5) rescued sea turtles were released from different beaches around Hainan island to maximize conservation awareness for World Oceans Day as recognized by the United Nations. On June 23, 2015, during the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the United States State Department and the National Development and Reform Commission agreed \\"for the first time, to tackle marine species, agreeing to collaborate in stemming the illegal trade in totoaba and sea turtles, share public education best practices, and work jointly on enforcement.\\" To move forward with this initiative, the United States and China announced their official support for Sea Turtles 911 and Hainan Normal University to \\"track sea turtle migration, help restore habitats, and foster community involvement in sea turtle protection,\\" as part of the U.S.-China EcoPartnerships. On January 15, 2016, United States Ambassador to China and former U.S. Senator Max Baucus supported sea turtle conservation in South China's Hainan province with Sea Turtles 911. Baucus released two satellite tagged turtles named Harvard and Yale into the South China Sea for conservation purposes. According to Founder Frederick Yeh, the U.S. Ambassador's charitable act was recognized as symbolic because \\"Sea turtles are charismatic, migratory animals that serve as natural ambassadors of the ocean; as communities and countries work together to preserve this flagship species for future generations, our shared mission to save sea turtles nurtures a peaceful platform of common grounds to improve community and international relations.\\"  See also  * Animal welfare in China  References  External links  * CCTV News Segment Turtle conservation organizations Animal welfare organizations based in China ","title":"Sea Turtles 911"},{"id":"31292605","title":"Oc√©ane Zhu"},{"id":"31292610","text":"''''', Latin for \\"of the king\\", occurs in numerous English place names.

He authored the first historical account of Rhode Island, An Historical Discourse on the Civil and Religious Affairs of the Colony of Rhode-Island, in New England in America. From the First Settlement in 1638, to the end of the First Century. Biography=Early life= Baptist clergyman and historian, John Callender was born in 1706 in Boston, Massachusetts to John Callender, a shopkeeper, and Priscilla Man. In his early youth, John Callender showed unusual intellectual promise, he attended Harvard College at age 13, where he was introduced to the legacy of early Baptist's in America. The first president of Harvard College and theologian Henry Dunster had been influenced by early American Baptist leaders, Dr. John Clarke and other Rhode Island Baptists.William H. Brackney, Baptists in North America: an historical perspective (2006) p. 12 Founder of Boston's first Baptist Church, Henry Dunster was forced to resign from Harvard after he refused to baptize his infant. As a Harvard scholarship student, John Callender was supported by the benefactions of Thomas Hollis (1659‚Äì1731), a Baptist and Calvinist, and Thomas Brattle, then-Harvard College treasurer and a member of the Royal Society. At graduation in 1726, young Callender was awarded the honor of delivering an address on the proposition, \\"Scriptura credendi et agendi est norma perfecta et sola,\\" or \\"The perfect and only rule for believing and acting is Scripture.\\" Elton, \\"Memoir,\\" 11. John Callender was baptized that same year in 1726 by his uncle, Elisha Callender, the pastor of First Baptist Church in Boston, a congregation previously led by grandfather Ellis Callender.https://archive.org/details/revjohnmylesfo00king He was voted a license to preach in 1727, and thereafter, he briefly preached and taught school at First Baptist Church in Swansea in Bristol County.Romeo Elton, \\"Memoir of Reverend John Callender,\\" pages 9-44 in An Historical Discourse on the Civil and Religious Affair of the Colony of Rhode-Island, page 10. =Career as clergyman= Until 1730, Callender served as pastor at a historic Baptist Church in Swansea, Massachusetts. After leaving the pulpit in Swansea, Callender settled in United Baptist Church (Newport, Rhode Island), where he remained for the rest of his life.Elton, \\"Memoir,\\" 12-13. Callender was ordained on October 13, 1731 by his uncle Elisha Callender, a pastor at First Baptist Church in Boston, who delivered a sermon on New Testament Book of Matthew, 28.18-19.Elton, \\"Memoir,\\" 13. Callender's role in Newport from 1731 to 1748, 40-years before the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788, has significance to the early history of the Baptist Church in North America. Roger Williams and John Clarke established The Baptist Church in Newport for religious freedom. In 1638, Minister John Clarke of Great Britain was exiled from Massachusetts after disagreeing with Puritan leaders, and sought freedom of worship in nearby Portsmouth, Rhode Island, (Newport County) . By 1639, Williams had founded a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island, and in 1640, Clarke had established a Baptist church in Newport, Rhode Island.Thomas S. Kidd and Barry Hankins, Baptists in America: A History (2015) Redwood Library =Societal involvement= Shortly after moving to Newport, Rhode Island in 1731, Callender became deeply interested in the public schools of Newport. He also became a member of an exclusive philosophical and literary society, later incorporated in 1874 as the company of the Redwood Library and Athenaeum, organized by Bishop Berkeley, which included Justice Edward Scott; Attorney General of Rhode Island Daniel Updike; Colonial governor of Rhode Island Josias Lyndon; John Brett; Thomas Ward; Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court and signer of the Declaration of Independence William Ellery; Minister of Trinity Church, Newport, Rhode Island James Honyman; James Searing; John Checkley; Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Boston Jeremiah Condy; and occasional esteemed members, including Governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and signer of the Declaration of Independence Stephen Hopkins ; as well as the poet, essayist, moralist, and biographer Samuel Johnson. The purpose of the society was to share ideas and collect valuable books, the combined efforts of which are still housed in the oldest section of the library, the Harrison Room. The Redwood Library and Anthenaeum is a Georgian- Palladian style building designed and built in 1750 by colonial American architect, Peter Harrison, from York, England, who emigrated to Rhode Island in 1740. Redwood Library and Athenaeum is credited as America's second oldest public library and first classical public building. =An Historical Discourse... and other publications= Callender is perhaps best known for his address An Historical Discourse on the Civil and Religious Affairs of the Colony of Rhode-Island, delivered on March 24, 1738; the first historical account of Rhode Island.Elton, \\"Memoir,\\" 19. Also known as \\"Century Sermon,\\" it was for more than one hundred years, the only civic and religious history of Rhode Island, reprinted in 1838 by the Rhode Island Historical Society, with a memoir from the author, and notes by Romeo Elton. Callender published sermons and a collection of documents related to the history of Baptists in America, with an afterword by Issac Backus. In 1739, he published a sermon delivered on the occasion of the ordination of Mr. Jeremiah Condy at First Baptist Church in Boston. A discourse published in 1791 recommends advantages of early religion to assist children to live lives of love in service to God. In 1745, Callender published a funeral sermon for Nathaniel Clap, and in 1763, \\"The Hymn to the Power of Harmony.\\" He also published a historical oration delivered to the congregants in Boston, on July 4, 1797, to commemorate the anniversary of American independence. =Personal life and death= On February 15, 1730, Callender married Elizabeth Hardin of Swansea, Massachusetts. They had a family of six children: Elizabeth, Mary, John, Elias, Sarah, and Josias.Elton, \\"Memoir,\\" 23. Callender died on January 26, 1748 after a long and painful illness.

Only one remains: Chester Non-High School District 122, whose territory is in and around Prairie du Rocher in Randolph County. More recent Illinois laws allow a unit school district to deactivate either its elementary schools or its high schools and pay the tuition for their students of the appropriate level to attend nearby districts' schools.

Yu defines landscape architecture as the art of survival, and tries to protect and reconstruct ecological infrastructurehttp://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GHSI200106002.htm] as holistic nature-based solutions to provide ecosystems services for cities, and to define a new aesthetics, the \\"big feet aethetic\\" based on environmental ethic. His pioneering research on \\"ecological security patterns\\".Negative Planning and \\"sponge cities\\" have been adopted by the Chinese government as a guiding theory for national land use planning, eco-city campaign, and urban ecological restoration. A native of China's Zhejiang Province, his guiding design principles are the appreciation of the ordinary, such as rural agricultural landscapes, and a deep embracing of nature, even in its potentially destructive aspects, such as urban flooding. He is a designed ecologist and he practices design as scientific experiments. He got inspirations from his farming experience and the ancient wisdom of water and waste management to design and test a series of nature-based solutions, such as constructed wetland for water cleansing, green sponge for storm water management, ecosystems services oriented design for brown field remediation, etc. He has made these solutions to become replicable ecological engineering modules to be implemented at large scale to solve ecological problems, such as flood, draught, water and soil pollution and habitat rehibiliation,thorugh which landscape in deep form---as oppostite to shallow form or fake form‚Äîcan be created. Yu's ecological approach to urbanism has been implemented in over 200 cities in China and abroad. He has won numerous international awards for his ecologically and culturally sensitive projects, including 12 American Society of Landscape Architects Excellence and Honor Awards,ASLA Excellence and Honor Awards an ULI Global Award for Excellence in 2009, and 5 WAF Landscape of the year Awards at the World Architecture Festival (2009, 2010, 2011,2015 and 2017). = Published works = Yu has published over 20 books and 300 articles.

The contributing structures were built using locally obtained native materials in a late interpretation of the National Park Service Rustic style. Native landscaping enhances the site. Much of the work was carried out by Public Works Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps workers. and The most significant building is the Administration Building (), a two-story masonry and wood frame structure with a long, horizontal design, emphasized by linear banding in the shingle cladding of the second story. The Custodian's Residence or Superintendent's Residence () housed the park superintendent until the 1980s when it was converted to offices. The irregularly shaped two- story building is similar in style and materials to the headquarters. A somewhat separated area comprises several maintenance buildings. The Gas and Oil House building () uses coursed stone and heavy timber, with a porte- cochere extending from the front to shelter gas pumps. The Transformer Vault and Pump House () is similar in character. The Equipment Shed/Carpenter Shop () is a stone and frame building in a saltbox shape with projecting bracketed eaves that anticipate the Mission 66 style structures on the 1950s and 1960s. The Equipment and Supply Building (), measuring by is a masonry and frame building, with a large frame extension that burned in 1965. This section was replaced with a historically faithful copy in 1970. The Headquarters District is close to the park, but outside its primary boundaries.

Her success encouraged the couple to return to Warsaw, where in 1912 she starred in Anshel Shor and Joseph Rumshinsky's Dos meydl fun der vest (Di Amerikanerin) and later Khantshe in Amerike and Alma, vu voynstu? (Alma, where do you live?) and the German operetta Puptshik. According to scholar Nina Warnke, Young became \\"the most beloved Yiddish actress in Poland and Russia during the 1910s\\" ‚Äì popular not only among Yiddish-speaking operetta audiences but also among non-Jewish Poles and Russians.Warnke, Nina (March 2004). \\"Going East: The Impact of American Yiddish Plays and Players on the Yiddish stage in Czarist Russia, 1890-1914\\". American Jewish History. Vol. 92, no. 1\\\\. p. 1-29; here: p. 26\\\\. doi: 10.1353/ajh.2005.0039. Yiddish intellectuals and literati in Warsaw, including critics A. Mukdoyni (pseudonym of Alexander Kappel), Noach Prilutski, Dovid Frishman, and I. L. Peretz, held her acting in high esteem, despite their general ambivalence about the influx of American plays and actors into Europe at that time.Warnke (2004), p. 27-28. Although not all of the plays in her repertoire were set in the United States, she cultivated a profile of an American playing American characters.Warnke (2004), p. 28. Young's husband Boas, in his memoir Mayn Lebn (1950), recalled the broad appeal of the musical Di amerikanerin among Warsaw's diverse Jewish population: > Masses of Poles came to see Di amerikanerin; Warsaw assimilators were not > embarrassed to come to the Yiddish theater ... young Hasidim would sneak > into the theater ... [and] Jewish literati saw in Clara Young's performances > a revival of the Yiddish language. Quoted in Warnke (2004), p. 27 (ellipses > as in Warnke). He noted that the play's music (composed by Rumshinsky) \\"could be heard in all cabarets\\", where it was sung by Jews and non-Jews alike.Warnke (2004), p. 27, with quotation from Boaz. Young's popularity grew when she starred in her husband's Jeykele the bluffer. In 1922 she starred in the premiere of Boris Thomashefsky's Di grine kuzine. In 1923, at the Prospect Theater, she played the title role in Der yeshiva bokher (The schoolboy), soon after traveling in Poland and the Soviet Union for several years, then Argentina and Brazil in 1928, then back to Lodz, Warsaw, Riga and Vilna in the 1930s, then Paris, Berlin, and London, Belgium, Mexico and Cuba. Subsequently, Clara Young returned alone to the Soviet Union, became a Soviet citizen, and spent the rest of her life there.Warnke (2004), p. 28, note 61. In 1941 Young was among friends that the Polish-born actress Ida Kami≈Ñska met up with in Tashkent when all were temporarily stuck there under the wartime conditions.Sandrow, Nahma (1996).

History  The boundaries of districts have changed over history. Previous politicians of a specific numbered district have represented a different geographic area, due to redistricting. After the fifth (1852) session of the state legislature, the Wisconsin Senate was expanded to 25 members. The first member for the 25th District was James T. Lewis, of Columbus (later a Governor of Wisconsin). The district at that time consisted of Columbia County.Manual for the Use of the Assembly, of the State of Wisconsin, for the Year 1853 Madison: Brown and Carpenter, Printers, 1853; pp. 67, 85 This was true until 1872, when the district became the counties of the counties of Green Lake, Marquette and Waushara (Columbia County was now the Twenty-Seventh District). In 1876, the Senate was again redistricted: the Twenty-Fifth now consisted of the City of Madison, and various other Towns and Villages in Dane County, Wisconsin (more or less the previous Seventh District); while what had been the 25th was now the Ninth District.Warner, Hans B., ed. The Blue Book of the State of 0Wisconsin 1880 Madison, 1880; pp. 498, 500, 505 In 1883, the Twenty-Fifth now consisted of Eau Claire, Pepin and Pierce Counties (three of the eleven counties which had made up the Seventh District); Dane County became the Twenty-Sixth District. From 1887-1891, the district consisted of Clark and Eau Claire Counties. The short-lived redistricting of 1891 left the district consisting of Clark, Price, Taylor, and Wood Counties. From 1892-1895, the district once again consisted of Clark and Eau Claire Counties. From 1896-1910, the district consisted of Clark and Marathon Counties. From 1911-1922, the district consisted of Langlade and Marathon Counties. From 1923-1954, the district consisted of Lincoln and Marathon Counties. After the 1954 redistricting, the district had completely changed, and now consisted of Ashland, Bayfield, and Douglas Counties (Lincoln and Marathon Counties had been split between the new 12th and 29th Districts). The 1960 federal census showed that this district, at 74,293 people, was the least populous of Wisconsin's 33 districts, 38.0% below the average;Toepel, M. G.; Theobald, H. Rupert, eds. The Wisconsin Blue book, 1962 Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1962; p. 352 in the wake of Baker v. Carr, a redistricting would be necessary. After a great deal of litigation, the Wisconsin Supreme Court created a redistricting map promulgated on May 14, 1964. The new Twenty-Fifth District added Iron, Price, Rusk and Sawyer Counties to the district.Theobald, H. Rupert, ed. The Wisconsin Blue book, 1964 Madison, 1964; pp. 787-789 The 1972 redistricting took away Rusk County and a southern portion of Price County, adding the eastern part of Barron County instead; but left the district mostly unchanged.Theobald, H. Rupert; Robbins, Patricia V., eds. The State of Wisconsin 1973 Blue Book Madison: Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, distributed by Document Sales, 1973; p. 70 The 1982 redistricting removed Price County entirely, and modified the Barron County portion, as well as adding one Rusk County township. In 1992, the latest court-ordered redistricting added the remainder of Barron County, while dropping the Rusk County township once more. The 2002 court-ordered redistricting added part of Burnett County for the first time, while taking away segments of Sawyer and Barron Counties. The new 2011 redistricting bill took away most of Sawyer, but added for the first time a single township in Vilas County, and a township from both Dunn and Saint Croix Counties, and Price County in whole.

The game was developed and published by Playfish and was released via Facebook in May 2010. In 2011 My Empire became the inaugural winner of the Social Network Game category at the 2011 BAFTA Video Game Awards. The game was deliberately targeted at an older age range than Playfish's previous Facebook games, as the developer thought that there was an under-served market that the game would be able to capitalise on. Playfish took My Empire and five other games offline in September 2011, citing a lack of players. Playfish had also used the game to experiment with mobile phone integration with Facebook games. In November 2010, it launched an app that allowed users to manage their tax collection and resources in the game via their mobile phone, but the users weren't able to play the full game on the phone.  Gameplay  The player starts the game in a small village with a low population. The goal of the game is for the player to expand their village into a large city. The player achieves this by building new homes to increase the population and by building leisure buildings to keep them happy. To generate money, the player must hire a tax collector to collect taxes from the people. Certain gameplay aspects are only achievable by engaging with other players; for example, the player can't obtain all of the materials used in the construction of a \\"wonder\\", like Stonehenge, on their own, they will require a friend to gift them one of the materials used. Reception Gamezebo scored the game as 4/5 and praised the graphics and the simplification of the city building to a fun activity. The size of the cities were praised along with the fact that the game doesn't make money management an essential part of the game. It criticised the uneven pace and called the user interface \\"unintuitive\\", it also thought that the tax system was a little broken and that some gameplay goals are not obvious enough.

Early life and career Longrigg was born in Sevenoaks, Kent and educated at Highgate School in London, where he won the Governors' gold medal and was later Chairman of Governors from 1954 - 1965. After winning a scholarship to study Classics at Oriel College, Oxford, where he gained a 1st in Honour Moderations, he served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment from 1914, was twice mentioned in dispatches and then returned to Oxford from Iraq for his MA degree at the end of his military service in 1921. He then joined the British Administration in Iraq and served as Inspector- General of Revenue between 1927 and 1931. It was during this time that he wrote Four Centuries of Modern Iraq (1925), a history of Iraq under the Ottoman Empire.Four Centuries of Modern Iraq Career with the Iraq Petroleum Company In 1931, as part of a policy to replace British officials with Iraqis, Longrigg left the administration and joined the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC). By now he was an accomplished linguist and Arabist, with a wide knowledge of tribal affairsLongrigg, Stephen Hemsley (1893‚Äì1979) by Edward Ullendorff, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He joined IPC at a time when the Company was preparing to build the first pipeline system from Kirkuk to the Mediterranean. Being appointed as a Land and Liaison Officer, Longrigg's role was to organise the purchase of land for the pipeline, pumping stations, terminals and depots along the route. He also had to organise the recruitment of labour, rates of pay and conditions of employment, and to make arrangements for the security of Company personnel and property.Obituary by G.H. Herridge in the IPC Society Newsletter, No. 24, October 1979, pp.24-26 In 1933, before the pipeline was completed, Longrigg was sent to Jeddah to join negotiations for an oil concession for the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. He was unsuccessful in this, on account of IPC's refusal to make payments to the Saudi Arabian government in gold rather than rupees. The successful bidder, Standard Oil of California, went on to discover oil at Dammam in 1938 and in due course became known as Aramco. In 1936, he was appointed general manager of an IPC subsidiary company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd, and spent that summer in Saudi Arabia obtaining oil concessions for the provinces of Hejaz and Asir (IPC did not find oil and abandoned the concession in 1941).H.

The club was founded in 1923. In February 2013, the club was renamed OFK Russel Gabƒç√≠kovo, due to the club's new sponsor. In 2016, the club was dissolved due to financial problems. History If we take just football as the basis of organized sports, its origins date back over seventy-two years. However, if we seek the origins of folk games based on active movement, we have a very difficult time finding their first roots. How did it actually start with football? Easily: in green- and blue-white. It is explained very clearly by the book titled 70 Years of Sports in Gabƒç√≠kovo ‚Äì 1923‚Äì1993, according to which right after World War I French Legionnaires had been accommodated in the Castle Amade, who used to play football in the park of the castle. The bystander local youth liked this game very much. However, there was a problem: the villagers had no ball. Meanwhile, they learned that the French soldiers adored cat meat and, consequently, the population of cats became soon ‚Äúthinned‚Äù in Gabƒçikovo. The villagers sold male and female cats to Legionnaires and bought a real soccer ball. Let‚Äôs suppose that indeed in 1923 football in Gabƒçikovo started its ‚Äújourney of conquest‚Äù. However, in that case something is wrong, there is something contradictory in the memories of Imrich Vida and Michal Kov√°cs: ‚ÄúThe interest was great, and after all, we urged the youth to play, too!‚Äù The idea of founding our own team came up immediately; however, some basic statutes would have been necessary for that, but we did not have available anything like that. Fortunately, the local Roman Catholic Reverend ‚Äì priest Rezs≈ë Bohus also supported us, even joined us... Concerning the previous quote, just two comments: Rezs≈ë Bohus was appointed to the post of parish priest of the village of Gabƒç√≠kovo only in July 1929, so he could join the football team at the most in the summer of 1930! On the other hand, the basis Statute of BSK ‚Äì i.e. the Sports Club of Gabƒç√≠kovo already existed in 1927! The football team of Gabƒç√≠kovo was in 1927 officially renamed as Gabƒç√≠kovsk√Ω ≈†portov√Ω Klub ‚Äì BSK (BSK is the abbreviation of the Hungarian version of the club‚Äôs title). BSK then played matches in green and white colors; players had a set of sports uniforms and two footballs. Franti≈°ek Bartalos recorded the statutes of the club. Leadership positions were given to the former athlete from Budapest, ƒΩudov√≠t P√©k and a local player, ≈†tefan Kom√°romi. The backbone of the team was constituted by: Franti≈°ek Pavlovics, Vojtech Bartal, Vojtech Kov√°cs, Jozef Bartal, Jozef Pavlovics, Franti≈°ek Vass, Jozef Horv√°th, and Imrich Vida, just like Franti≈°ek Sveiger, Rezs≈ë Koczk√°s, Ladislav Bod√≥, Eugen Bod√≥ and ≈†tefan Horv√°th. The team of this club even won a Winning Cup in 1928 against other teams from the surrounding villages. During the years 1938‚Äì1945 Gabƒç√≠kovo was again attached to Hungary, and the football players of the Sports Club of Gabƒç√≠kovo had been included into the County Youth League of Gy≈ër* in the context of football championships (*this included youth, who, depending on their age were classified into the organization for compulsory pre-military training of youth that existed in the years from 1921 to 1944 only in the former Hungary ‚Äì comment of the translator). Arp√°d Knap and Michal Viola, who were coaches, prepared the following athletes from Gabƒç√≠kovo for football: Ladislav M√≥zes, Franti≈°ek Sveiger, Eugen Both, Ign√°c Jakus, Tibor Cs√∂rg≈ë, Michal Varga, J√∫lius Nagy, Ladislav Derzsi, Imrich Both, J√°n Gr√≥f, ƒΩudov√≠t T√≥th, ƒΩudov√≠t R√°k√≥czi, Eugen Raj and Franti≈°ek Raj ‚Äì who actually formed the framework of the football team. After World War II, in 1947, properly organized football \\"kicked off\\". At its ‚Äúcradle‚Äù stood Arp√°d Gr√≥f, Aurel Heizer, Eugen Both, J√°n Gr√≥f, Alfred Bellus, Arp√°d Nagy and others who have contributed to the football playing of the team of Gabƒç√≠kovo by their help ‚Äì at the district championship organized in Dunajsk√° Streda. For a long time, the footballers of ƒåalovo (today Veƒæk√Ω Meder ‚Äì comment of the translator) and Dunajsk√° Streda have undermined the possibility of footballers from Gabƒç√≠kovo stepping higher. Finally in 1958 Gabƒç√≠kovo won the championship in the district and stepped forward to the regional championship, where the footballers of Gabƒç√≠kovo had remained until 1961. It was in that year when the team fell back to the level of district championships in which the team of Gabƒç√≠kovo played football matches between the years of 1961 and 1968 under the name of ‚ÄúDru≈æstevn√≠k‚Äù (‚ÄúCooperator‚Äù), despite the fact that this their ‚Äúgodfather‚Äù was unable to support them... In 1968, the creation of the team of an \\"innovative spirit‚Äù began. From the framework, which was constituted by: Ivan Frivalszky, Peter Frivalszky, ≈†tefan Varga, Matej Derzsi, ≈†tefan Both, Alfred Csiba, Imrich Csiba, Vojtech G√∫gh, Ivan Palkovics, Flori√°n Kozm√©r, Ladislav Patasi, Ondrej R√°k√≥czi, Jozef Nagy, ≈†tefan M√©sz√°ros, Mikul√°≈° Bod√≥, Alfred Szab√≥, Ga≈°par Derzsi, J√°n Ondr√°≈°ek (four-time Czechoslovak national team), Peter Derzsi, Pavol Derzsi, Ladislav Sid√≥, ƒΩudov√≠t M√©sz√°ros and Franti≈°ek Heiszer ‚Äì coach Franti≈°ek Kuczmann prepared such a squad, which in 1976 won the title of district champion! Gabƒç√≠kovo moved to the county I. B league. In 1978 the team was reorganized again. The squad consisted of the following players: A. Luk√°cs, L. Nagy, Magyarics, Gy. Horv√°th, Seb≈ë, Patasi, Sipos, Gaura, Hal√°sz, Balogh, and ≈Ωiak, and was led by coach Alexander Br√°nyik into district class A. In the context of the football cup, this squad even ‚Äúfought itself‚Äù into the circle of the sixteen best club teams in Slovakia. Within the framework of championships, in the years 1979‚Äì1980 Gabƒç√≠kovo ‚Äúended‚Äù at 13th place; however, already in the season after ‚Äì to the delight of its fans ‚Äì it got up on the podium. The bronze group consisted at the time of its new coach, Bertalan Sipos and the following players: M√©sz√°ros, Botl√≥, Farkas, Fodor, Izsm√°n, L√©pes, Derzsi, Seb≈ë, Malinovszky, On√≥dy, Cs√°n√≥, ≈†kabla, ≈†tropka, Di√≥szegi, Nagy, and G√°bri≈°. Subsequently, first this football team from Gabƒç√≠kovo ranked itself at 4th place, and in the championship of 1982‚Äì83 it ranked itself at 5th place; however, under a new name, the ‚ÄúTelov√Ωchovn√° Jednota ≈†t√°tneho Majetku Gabƒç√≠kovo‚Äù (‚ÄúPhysical Education Union of the State Property of Gabƒç√≠kovo‚Äù), i.e. TJ SM Gabƒç√≠kovo. In the meantime, the national economy started to sponsor this club with its ‚Äúprotective wings‚Äù, and the club started to succeed increasingly under the leadership of its director, coming from Baky. In the ranks of the team some changes were made and thus in 1989 it won the championship in class I. A. Two years later the team got into the so- called ‚Äúwestern‚Äù team of class II of the Slovak National League. In 1991 the team remained in its class, although ‚Äúon shaky legs‚Äù, but in 1993 it strengthened itself again and won another championship! Members of the championship team were: Sergei Prikhodko and Attila Jankovics ‚Äì goalkeepers, defenders were: Barnab√°≈° Kov√°ts, Franti≈°ek T√≥th (team captain), Jozef Medgyes, Franti≈°ek Csiff√°ri, Dezider Varga, Milan ≈†koda and Genadij Salov; deep-lying playmakers were: Tiham√©r Varga, Jozef Ravasz, Tibor Domonkos, Zolt√°n M√©sz√°ros, Peter Moln√°r and Ferdinand Szab√≥; and the forwards were: Zsolt Gy≈ëri, Tibor Szab√≥ and Gabriel Johancsik who attacked the opponents' goal. The education of adolescents means continuous renewal and refreshment of football in Gabƒç√≠kovo. The young football players have been systematically dealt with since 1948. In 1976 the youth football team of Gabƒç√≠kovo achieved the title District Champion, and afterwards, in 1977 it achieved the title of a Champion in class I.B and it got to the class I.A, where the team of players, consisting of the following players: Darnay, Izsm√°n, √Å. M√©sz√°ros, Jandura, Szeif, Both, Katona, Vida, R. Nagy, R. M√©sz√°ros, K√°ntor and V√∂r√∂s was led by the following coaches: Alfr√©d Fekete and ≈Ωigmund V√©gh with the relevant knowledge and experience. In 1993 the club celebrated its 70th anniversary ‚Äì thanks to the sponsorship of the state property of Gabƒç√≠kovo ‚Äì not only with the championship team of seniors but also with that of the youth! The goal difference they achieved could be recorded into the book of records: 136:23! The framework of the junior championship team consisted of the following players: Arnold Schweiger and Tibor Csonka ‚Äì goalkeepers, Robert Szek√°cs, Matej Jakus, Robert Oll√©, Arp√°d M√©sz√°ros and Ladislav Derzsi ‚Äì defenders, Imrich Gr√≥f, Kornel Csicsay, Imrich Hars√°nyi, Adrian Zs√°kovics, Koloman Strbka and ≈†tefan Kov√°cs ‚Äì midfield players, and Norbert Both, Imrich Pusk√°s, Szil√°rd Fekete, Ladislav Fenes and Marian Cs√∂lle ‚Äì forwards.

He continued to play both sports throughout his schooling and earned representative honours for the under-19 Queensland rugby union team as well as the Queensland Australian rules football state team. Australian National Football Council rules at the time stated that New South Wales and Queensland were considered developmental states and would not allow players to switch into the VFL in fear of diminishing the local talent pool.

The painting illustrates a passage from the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic compiled by Elias L√∂nnrot in the 19th century. The scene portrayed is taken from the 43rd song of the epic, where the hero V√§in√§m√∂inen, seen wielding a sword, has stolen the precious artifact Sampo from the evil witch Louhi, and she, having taken the form of a giant bird, is trying to reclaim it. The battle for the Sampo is also given a deeper connotation as a battle for the soul of Finland. Reception When the painting was first exhibited, it received widespread attention and was considered to be Gallen-Kallela's finest work. Gallen- Kallela's vision of a warlike V√§in√§m√∂inen was seen as a radical departure from the old, gray-bearded sage of older renditions. In the painting, V√§in√§m√∂inen's long, flowing white hair and beard are dramatically contrasted by his strong, muscular body. The painting was originally commissioned by a wealthy patron from Helsinki, Salomo Wuorio, for his dining room. According to Gallen- Kallela's notes, however, the deal was amicably dissolved when the patron's wife had an extremely negative reaction to the finished work. Afterwards, The Defense of the Sampo was purchased by the Turku Arts Association (Turun taideyhdistys) for the previously unheard-of price of 4000 marks. Gallen- Kallela created a well-received fresco of the same painting for the Finnish gallery at the Paris World's fair 1900 (destroyed at the end of the fair), and again in 1928, for the National Museum of Finland foyer in Helsinki where it remains viewable to this day.

For a time he was president of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours, a medium in which he showed a pleasing freedom and simplicity of style. Life Latona and the Lycian Peasants Cristall was born at Camborne in Cornwall. His mother shared with and inspired in her son a taste for classic art. His father was Scottish and bitterly opposed to his son's artistic tastes, but his mother secretly aided him in his struggles to study art. He was joined at school in London by his sister Ann Batten Cristall, who was to become a poet and a schoolteacher.Richard Greene: \\"Cristall, Ann Batten (bap. 1769, d. 1848)\\", rev. Leya Landau. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004). Retrieved 19 October 2015. Pay-walled He was first apprenticed to a china dealer at Rotherhithe, but after finding that business too irksome, he left for the Staffordshire Potteries, where he found employment as a china painter. Finding that job too monotonous, he went to London, and commenced a life of great privations and hard efforts to study the fine arts. During this period of his life, he reportedly seriously injured his health by trying to live for a year on just potatoes and water. Aided in secret by his mother, he persevered in his endeavours, and finally gained admission to the school of the Royal Academy, where he made rapid progress. He became personally known to Dr. Monro and visited his house, where he met the rising water-colour artists of the day. A Cottage on the Side of Symond's Rock In 1805, he became a founder of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours and made the first public exhibition of his works there, continuing to exhibit there for many years, and later becoming its President. In 1822, with his health in decline, Cristall went to Goodrich on the Wye, where he had bought a house and spent happy years, until the loss of his wife in 1840 drove him again to London, where he died in 1847. His body was buried next to his wife in Goodrich, as he had requested. Works Cristall's usual subjects in early years were classical figures with landscapes, such as his Lycidas, Judgment of Paris, Hylas and the Nymphs, and Diana and Endymion, but he moved later to genre subjects and rustic groups. Around 1813 he tried portrait painting, generally small full- lengths with landscape backgrounds using no body-colour. As a watercolour painter, Cristall gained an honourable position from the freedom and simplicity of his style and manner of execution. Five of his drawings (including The Young Fisher-Boy and The Fish Market on Hastings Beach) are in the South Kensington Museum. Cristall was an early member of the Sketching Society. He also furnished some of the classical figures in Barret's landscapes and some groups in George Fennell Robson's Scotch Scenery.

CARS uses the Army's traditional regiments as parent organizations for historical purposes, but the primary building blocks are divisions, and brigades composed of battalions. Each battalion carries an association with a parent regiment, even though the regimental organization no longer exists. In some brigades several numbered battalions carrying the same regimental association may still serve together, and tend to consider themselves part of the traditional regiment when in fact they are independent battalions serving a brigade, rather than a regimental, headquarters. The CARS was replaced by the U.S. Army Regimental System (USARS) in 1981. =21st century= There are exceptions to USARS regimental titles, including the Armored Cavalry Regiments and the 75th Ranger Regiment created in 1986. On 1 October 2005, the word \\"regiment\\" was formally appended to the name of all active and inactive CARS and USARS regiments. So, for example, the 1st Cavalry officially became titled the 1st Cavalry Regiment Branch insignia Two gold color crossed muskets, vintage 1795 Springfield musket (Model 1795 Musket), 3/4 inch in height. Crossed muskets were first introduced into the U.S. Army as the insignia of officers and enlisted men of the Infantry on 19 November 1875 (War Department General Order No. 96 dtd 19 Nov 1875) to take effect on or before 1 June 1876. Numerous attempts in the earlier years were made to keep the insignia current with the ever-changing styles of rifles being introduced into the Army. However, in 1924 the branch insignia was standardized by the adoption of crossed muskets and the 1795 model Springfield Arsenal musket was adopted as the standard musket to be used. This was the first official United States shoulder arm, made in a government arsenal, caliber .69, flint lock, smooth bore, muzzle loader. The standardized musket now in use was first suggested by Major General Charles S. Farnsworth, U.S. Army, while he was the first Chief of Infantry, in July 1921, and approved by General Pershing, Chief of Staff, in 1922. The device adopted in 1922 has been in continual use since 1924. There have been slight modifications in the size of the insignia over the years; however, the basic design has remained unchanged. =Branch plaque= The plaque design has the branch insignia, letters and border in gold. The background is Saxony blue. =Regimental insignia= Personnel assigned to the Infantry branch affiliate with a specific regiment and wear the insignia of the affiliated regiment. = Regimental coat of arms = There is no standard infantry regimental flag to represent all of the infantry regiments. Each regiment of infantry has its own coat of arms which appears on the breast of a displayed eagle. The background of all the infantry regimental flags is flag blue with yellow fringe. =Branch colors= Saxony Blue ‚Äì 65014 cloth; 67120 yarn; PMS 5415. The Infantry has made two complete cycles between white and light blue. During the Revolutionary War, white facings were prescribed for the Infantry. White was the color used for Infantry until 1851 at which time light or Saxony blue was prescribed for the pompon and for the trimming on Infantry horse furniture. In 1857, the color was prescribed as sky blue. In 1886, the linings of capes and trouser stripes were prescribed to be white. However, in 1902, the light blue was prescribed again. In 1917, the cape was still lined with light blue but the Infantry trouser stripes were of white as were the chevrons for enlisted men. The infantry color is light blue; however, infantry regimental flags and guidons have been National Flag blue since 1835. White is used as a secondary color on the guidons for letters, numbers, and insignia. =Birthday= 14 June 1775. The Infantry is the oldest branch in the Army. Ten companies of riflemen were authorized by the Continental Congress Resolve of 14 June 1775. However, the oldest Regular Army Infantry Regiment, the 3rd Infantry, was constituted on 3 June 1784 as the First American Regiment.

Current types of U.S. Army Infantry (Comparison with U.S. Marine Corps Infantry) The US Army currently employs three types of infantry: light infantry (consisting of four sub-types), Stryker infantry, and mechanized infantry. The infantrymen themselves are essentially trained, organized, armed, and equipped the same, save for some having airborne, air assault, and/or Ranger qualification(s), the primary difference being in the organic vehicles (or lack thereof) assigned to the infantry unit, or the notional delivery method (e.g., parachute drop or heliborne) employed to place the infantryman on the battlefield. All modern US Army rifle platoons contain three nine-man rifle squads, except for mechanized infantry, which only has two rifle squads per rifle platoon due to troop carrying limitations of the four Infantry Fighting Vehicles organic to each rifle platoon. Each type of infantry has a discrete TO&E.; Light and Ranger infantry have similar battalion organizations (i.e., an HHC and three infantry companies), however there are significant differences in the composition of each of the two types of companies between the battalions. Airborne and Air Assault infantry battalions (sharing essentially the same battalion, company, and platoon organization), are significantly larger than the light and Ranger infantry battalions, because they contain an anti-armor company and have a larger HHC. Stryker and mechanized infantry units' TO&Es; are markedly different from each other as well as from the several sub-types of light infantry. An obvious difference is the requirement to allow for additional manpower and equipment to man, maintain, and service their respective vehicles. =Light Infantry= Primarily foot-mobile, usually transported by motorized assets, capable of air assault operations. * Light Infantry: Standard light infantry not otherwise designated or qualified as one of the other three subtypes. Organized into battalions consisting of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) and three rifle companies. Three light infantry battalions form the primary maneuver component of an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Light). * Airborne Infantry: Parachute qualified and capable of night, low-level parachute insertion when deployed by U.S. Air Force fixed-wing strategic or tactical transport aircraft or Army Aviation assets. Organized into battalions consisting of an HHC, three rifle companies, and an antiarmor company. Three airborne infantry battalions form the primary maneuver component of an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne). * Air Assault Infantry: Assigned to units with associated Army Aviation elements, with both the infantry and aviation elements specifically trained and organized to perform the air assault mission, however all light infantry are capable of performing the air assault mission when transported by appropriate aviation assets. Organized into battalions consisting of an HHC, three rifle companies, and an antiarmor company.

The Academy is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Various levels of membership are available to physicians specialized in child psychiatry or pediatrics, as well as medical students interested in the field, in the United States and abroad. Established in 1953 as the American Academy of Child Psychiatry (AACP), it became the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) in 1989. Dr. William Ayres,a highly respected psychiatrist, served as president of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry from 1993 to 1995. Prosecutors‚Äô first effort to convict Ayres of sexually molesting his underage psychiatric patients ended in mistrial after jurors deadlocked in 2009 due to claims of dementia making him mentally incompetent to stand trial. In 2012, a forensic psychiatrist at Napa State Hospital, after gathering evidence from Ayres‚Äô daily interactions with staff, charged he had been using his knowledge of psychiatry to fake his symptoms of dementia. In 2013 he was convicted of eight felony counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child and sentenced to 8 years in prison. Publications Since 1962, the AACAP has published its monthly journal, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (JAACAP). There have been concerns about industry-sponsored clinical trials published in the journal. JAACAP editors have repeatedly declined to retract the journal's 2001 article on study 329, a clinical trial examining paroxetine and teenagers. The trial was sponsored by, and ghostwritten on behalf of, SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline), and is widely regarded as having downplayed the trial's negative results.Isabel Heck, \\"Controversial Paxil paper still under fire 13 years later\\", The Brown Daily Herald, 2 April 2014.
