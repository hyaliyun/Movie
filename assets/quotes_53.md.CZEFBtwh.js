I wrote down briefly the short questions and bits of information, which I addressed to him on the sheets of paper lying at hand, and he then answered in the greatest detail, so that not only did no hiatus ever occur but his calmness and patience when I asked him to explain certain passages in his scores actually astonished me.... At times, in these conversations, he let fall many sarcastic remarks about the actual art currents of the day in Vienna, which slumbered profoundly under the spell of Italian superficiality....\\" Asked how he composes, Beethoven said: \\"I carry my thoughts about me for a long time, sometimes a very long time, before I set them down....

The composer wrote the libretto and subtitled his work: \\"Opernphantasie nach Texten von Friedrich Nietzsche / Szenen und Dithyramben\\" (\\"Operatic fantasy after texts by Friedrich Nietzsche / Scenes and dithyrambs). It premiered at the Salzburg Festival on 27 July 2010.  History  Dionysos is Rihm's eleventh work for the stage. He considered an opera around Dionysos for 15 years and realized it when he received a commission from the Salzburg Festival, the Staatsoper Unter den Linden Berlin and De Nederlandse Opera. Rihm wrote the libretto, based on Nietzsche's late work, which he fragmented and arranged in a different order. He chose the passages according to his plans for the music. Rihm said in an interview that opera needed more Magic Flute, \\"Mehr Machwerk.\\" (More action.), citing the opening scene with three ladies coming to the rescue of the prince attacked by a snake. Rihm said that opera finds its potential in situations that are not ordinary (\\"... findet ihre M√∂glichkeiten in Situationen, die nicht allt√§glich sind\\"). The opera has autobiographical traits and is in a way his first comic opera. Rihm dedicated the work \\"in friendship\\" to the conductor Ingo Metzmacher. Rihm composed mostly between December 2009 and May 2010, sending it in batches to the conductor. He finished the finale last minute. The opera premiered at the Haus f√ºr Mozart in Salzburg on 27 Juli 2010. Johannes Martin Kr√§nzle performed the title role (N.), with Mojca Erdmann, Elin Rombo and in leading roles, the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and the , conducted by Metzmacher and staged by Pierre Audi. The magazine Opernwelt chose the performance as the premiere of the year (Urauff√ºhrung des Jahres), and Kr√§nzle as singer of the year. A live recording was published as DVD.

Plot  The main character is called N., a symbol for both the poet Nietzsche, but also for Dionysos whose name Nietzsche used as his pen name for the dithyrambs. Some scenes relate to events in Nietzsche's life, others with the Dionysos myth. The action is not a linear story, but shows different views on life (Lebensbilder).  Music  A review of the premiere in Opernwelt notes the overwhelming echos of late-romantic sensuality of sound (√ºberbordender \\"Nachhall sp√§tromantischer Klangsinnlichkeit\\"), reminiscent of Richard Strauss and Johannes Brahms.

Surgeon-General of the Swedish Armed Forces (, previously Generalf√§ltl√§karen, since 2017 called the F√∂rsvarsinspekt√∂ren f√∂r h√§lsa och milj√∂, FIHM) is the senior medical officer of the Swedish Armed Forces. The Surgeon-General is responsible for the supervision of the Swedish Armed Forces, the Defence Materiel Administration, the Swedish Fortifications Agency and the National Defence Radio Establishment. This includes supervision in the areas of environment, health, nature, sewage, waste and chemicals. History A surgeon is a doctor who performs surgical operations. The Swedish Army's surgeons were named after their military rank: surgeon-captain, surgeon-major, surgeon-general, closest corresponding to the Swedish √∂verf√§ltl√§kare (\\"Chief Field Surgeon\\"), but not generalf√§ltl√§kare (\\"Surgeon-Field General\\"), because there were several surgeon-generals within the English Army. In Swedish history, physicians were mentioned for the first time in the 16th century. They were educated at medical schools abroad and were employed partly in the service of the court or the rich nobility, and in the military. They lacked a relationship among themselves and were not subordinate to any medical authority. The beginning of an organized medical system was not noticeable until much later. Some practicing physicians in Stockholm received after subservient request permission to form a Collegium medicorum which was privileged by King Charles XI's regency in 1663. From this initially individual circle of physicians, the authority was developed that was given the task of overseeing the state's health and medical care. The rank Surgeon-Field General (generalf√§ltl√§kare) existed according to the 1856 instruction of the Swedish Army Medical Corps (F√§ltl√§kark√•ren), but only during war time. In the Swedish Army Medical Corps on 1 January 1915, the following ranks were added; Surgeon-Field General (generalf√§ltl√§kare) instead of Chief Field Surgeon (√∂verf√§ltl√§kare), Chief Field Surgeon (√∂verf√§ltl√§kare) instead of field Surgeon (f√§ltl√§kare) and field Surgeon (f√§ltl√§kare) instead of Division surgeon (f√∂rdelningsl√§kare). The Swedish Army Medical Corps consisted in peace time of (except the reserve) 1 Surgeon-Field General (major general), 1 Chief Field Surgeon (colonel, respectively lieutenant colonels), 6 field surgeons (lieutenant colonels), 49 regimental physicians (majors), 55 battalion physicians in military units, hospitals, etc. (captains), 44 battalion physicians in the Field Medical Corps (captains and lieutenants) and 24 field medical grantees (lieutenants). The oversight of the entire Swedish medical administration was carried out for the civilian institutions by the National Swedish Board of Health and for the military by the Medical Board of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration (Arm√©f√∂rvaltningens sjukv√•rdsstyrelse) and the Sanitary Department of the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration (Marinf√∂rvaltningens sanitetsavdelning). The Medical Board consisted of a Director-General and Chief, as well as five directors (byr√•chef), including four doctors and a veterinarian. The Surgeon-Field General was the head of the Healthcare Board of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration and the Naval Chief Physician (marin√∂verl√§karen) was the head of the Sanitary Department of the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration. These officials were appointed by the King in Council. The Surgeon-Field General was in charge of the medical care management in the field, and was subordinate to the army's highest commander, and the acting Surgeon-Field General was in charge in the hometown. On 17 December 1943, the title was changed from Surgeon-Field General (generalf√§ltl√§kare) to Surgeon-General (generall√§kare) when acting Surgeon-Field General David Lindsj√∂ was nominated for this office. From 1969, the Surgeon-General was head of the Medical Board of the Swedish Armed Forces and the Medical Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces. Following the Swedish Armed Forces' reorganization in 1998, the Surgeon-General was part of the Joint Operations Command (Operationsledningen, OPL) as head of the Medical Services Department, but was in his capacity as the supervisory authority for the health service, responsible directly to the government. Today The Surgeon- General verifies that the Swedish Armed Forces comply with laws and regulations relating to environmental and health protection, food safety, animal protection, animal welfare, animal health, health and medical care and disease control. In the area of environmental and health protection, the Surgeon-General is also responsible for supervising the activities of the Defence Materiel Administration, the Swedish Fortifications Agency and the National Defence Radio Establishment. Supervision and control involves an independent review of compliance with applicable legislation. Therefore, when the Surgeon-General exercises his supervisory and control function he is not subordinate to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces. Every year, the Surgeon-General carries out about ten inspections and around 400 supervisory and inspection visits to garrisons, units, installations and exercises, both in Sweden and in places where the Swedish Armed Forces operates internationally. The Surgeon-General is appointed by the government. In the Supervisory Department, administrative officers, doctors, nurse, veterinarians, environmental and health protection inspectors, food inspectors, lawyer and department manager work. On 1 October 2017, the regulatory agency Generall√§karen changed name to F√∂rsvarsinspekt√∂ren f√∂r h√§lsa och milj√∂ (\\"Defense Inspector for Health and Environment\\").

It is about an ontological concept needing a philosophical place rather than a descriptive issue. With precursors in the 19th century, it emerged in its current in the 2010s.  History  Philosophical ethology develops from the thought of continental philosophers, whose researches involve ethology, philosophy and anthropology. Those authors had taken up the challenges coming from biology, phenomenology, critical theory, the Animal Studies and post-human philosophy. These are all disciplines dealing, each in its own way, with non-human animals and the interactions among living beings, in order to propose a new paradigm able to go beyond the limits of the anthropocentrism, which underlay traditional theories. The mean critics by those authors is the Cartesian heiress of automata:(IT) Ren√© Descartes, Discorso sul metodo, Opere, I, Roma-Bari, Laterza, [1637] 1967, pp. 129-182. whereas the classical ethology and behaviourism have described how the animal machine would work and which were the mechanisms regulating processes, nevertheless these authors did not challenge the mean idea, that is an animal is not a machine. Hence the need to elaborate a new multidisciplinary approach able to interpret the animal subjectivity ontologically speaking, and the different ontology correlated issues, such as the cultural dimensions, symbolicity and materiality in non- human animals and their intra and interspecific relationship.Report del convegno \\"What is Philosophical Ethology?\\" tenuto alla Curtin University (Australia) il 22 luglio 2015, ccat-lab.org.  Leading figures  Three recent issues of magazine Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities(EN) Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini & Matthew Chrulew, Philosophical ethology, in Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities, I, II, III, Routledge, 2014 - 2016. have explored the thought of three scholars considered among the most influential voices in the field of philosophical ethology by the editors of the magazine, Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini and Matthew Chrulew: the three authos are Vinciane Despret, Dominique Lestel and Roberto Marchesini.  Vinciane Despret  Belgian philosopher and professor at the University of Liege, Vinciane Despret has written many essays and articles about the history of ethology, psychology and human-animal relationship.(IT) Vinciane Despret, Quando il lupo vivr√† con l'agnello. Sguardo umano e comportamenti animali, Milano, Eleuthera, 2004, .(IT) Vinciane Despret, Hans, il cavallo che sapeva contare, Milano, Eleuthera, 2005, . All along her career, Despert has worked together with few authors from different disciplines (ethology, arts, literature) and with many non-human animals (elephants, mice, rats, monkeys).(EN) Brett Buchanan, Matthew Chrulew & Jeffrey Bussolini, On asking the right questions. An interview with Vinciane Despret, in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology II - Vinciane Despret, vol. 20, n¬∫ 2, Roudledge, 2015, pp. 165-178. These encounters allowed her to build a unique research path. In Despret‚Äôs writings, what is peculiar is the methodological approach and her anecdotal and idiosyncratic style: the author chooses to tell stories about animals (or, better, stories of relationship among animals, humans included) rather than to write about animals. Focal point to the authors is asking the right questions to non-human animals.(EN) Vinciane Despret&Brett; Buchanan, What Would Animals Say If We Asked the Right Questions?, in Posthumanities, Minneapolis, University Of Minnesota Press, 2016, . This means that animals are not texts to hermeneutically interpret, not object to quest via scientific experiments, but they are subjects able to provide their own answers to the questions interesting to them. Within philosophical ethology, Despret has stressed the repetitivity of any interspecific dialogue: non-human animals are being transformed by the encounter with the human beings, and, in the same way, human beings result transformed by the dialogue with the non-human. Despret‚Äôs stories are full of examples got by researchers, farmers, trainers ‚Äì along with likewise important autobiographical reports ‚Äì proving the enrichment coming from the encounter with the non-human animals.  Dominique Lestel  A French philosopher and ethologist, Lestel is \\"Ma√Ætre de conf√©rences\\" at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris and director of a research team about eco-anthropology and etnonlogy at the Mus√©um national d‚Äôhistoire naturelle.Dominique Lestel's Academic Positions, savoirs.ens.fr. His credit is stressing how a cultural phenomenon is not a human peculiarity.(FR) Dominique Lestel, Les origines animales de la culture, in Champs Essais, Paris, Flammarion, 2001, . To Lestel, it necessary to see at anthropo-poiesis with an evolutionary and pluralist lens and at culture as a domain no longer apart from nature. It is necessary to become aware that we live in a multi-species society where each species produces their own kind of culture. This proximity of space and time among beings from different species allows the emergence of few sincere friendship and relationship, that have a historical, ethical and political importance, to Lestel.(EN) Matthew Chrulew, The animal outside the text. An interview with Dominique Lestel, in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology I: Dominique Lestel, vol. 19, n¬∫ 3, Routledge, 2014, pp. 187-196. In 2016, during the International days of study GIS about human-animal held in Bologna, Lestel has rolled out his zoo-futurism, a philosophical artistic trend aiming to \\"re-animalise\\" the human being.(IT) Dominique Lestel, L‚Äôanimale √® l‚Äôavvenire dell‚Äôumano. Guida allo zoo-futurismo, in il Manifesto, 29 ottobre 2016.  Roberto Marchesini  An Italian philosopher, ethologist and zooanthopologist, Marchesini is director of Siua (School of Human-Animal interaction), of Study Centre of post-human philosophy and professor at few Italian universities. For over 20 years, he is leading a multidisciplinary project research about Zooanthropology, posts-human philosophy and bioethics to demonstrate that non-human animals have a referent role during the identity structuring (anthropo-poiesis)(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Antropodecentramento e ibridazioni. Progetto Posthuman e profilatura identitaria , in MeTis. Mondi educativi, temi indagini suggestioni, 2014. and the philosophical consequences coming from this kind of relationship. Main concepts in Marchesini‚Äôs thought are Zootropy and animal epiphany. With the term zootropy, Marchesini underlines the natural human tendency to turn to non-humans, like a kind of biophilia(IT) Edward Osborne Wilson, Biophilia, Harvard University Press, 1986, . rooted in our species that see in ethero-specifics some social counterparts able to contribute to anthropo-poiesis processes.(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Fondamenti di zooantropologia. La zooantropologia teorica, Bologna, Apeiron, 2014, . On the other side, with the concept of \\"animal epiphany\\", Marchesini points out the characteristic of enunciation and revelation coming from humans-non humans relationship. Animal diversity let human being imagine new existential paths ‚Äì in the flight of a bird, human being cannot see just the phenomenon per se, but perceive a new dimension of the thinking it is possible to fly(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Epifania animale. L'oltreuomo come rivelazione, Milano, Mimesis, 2014, p. 71, . ‚Äì and experiment an hybridational tension leading to identity slidings. With the essay Philosophical ethology,(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Etologia filosofica. Alla ricerca della soggettivit√† animale, Milano, Mimesis, 2016, . Marchesini focus on subjectivity. To him, subjectivity is foundation to conscience, not the opposite. Animals get constantly engaged from the external world through new occurrences asking for creativity and initiative not explicable with any automatism.(IT) R. Marchesini, Intelligenza emotiva versus intelligenza cognitiva, in Pluriverso, vol. 3, La Nuova Italia, 2001, pp. 22-33. From this point of view, to Marchesini, desire connects animals and the world, desire make them acting in their present.

She served in the Queen Alexandra Imperial Military Nursing Service during World War I and was one of the most decorated nurses of World War I.  Early life  James was born in Hokitika, on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island, to David James and Jane Clayton. Her father was a medical doctor from England. Her parents divorced in 1883 and her father returned to England in 1884. James was educated at Mrs Croasdaile Bowen's Private School in Christchurch and at Wellington Girls' College.  Career  From 1906 to 1909, James trained as a nurse at Wellington Hospital under Francis Payne, completing her national nursing examination in 1909. In January 1910 she left New Zealand for Europe, accompanying a pregnant woman to Genoa, Italy. At the end of that year she applied to join the Queen Alexandra Imperial Military Nursing Service and was accepted as a Staff Nurse. She served in London and Wiltshire, and when World War I broke out she was sent to France. James was initially stationed at Rouen, and later took charge of a field ambulance station at Arras. In June 1917 she was promoted to the rank of Sister and moved to work in a stationary hospital, then a casualty clearing station and an ambulance train. In 1918 she was appointed Acting Matron of a general hospital in Genoa, Italy. During World War I, James received six medals and was mentioned in dispatches twice. The awards were the Royal Red Cross, the Military Medal, the 1914 Star, the General Service War Medal, the Victory Medal, and the Allies' Medal. She also received five overseas service chevrons. In 1919, James returned to England from Italy and requested permission to travel to New Zealand to settle her father's estate; he had died in 1916. Her request was declined and instead she requested a transfer to London so she could consult with a visiting lawyer regarding her father's matters. In 1924 she was posted to Gibraltar and then Malta. She returned to England from 1926 to 1931, and was then posted to India, where she was appointed Matron of a hospital in Poona. She worked there until 1933, when she returned to England. She retired from the QAIMNS in 1937 and died in a nursing home in Sussex in 1969.

It stars Wiseman as a small-time drug dealer who takes care of an orphaned girl, played by Alexandra Newick, after her father dies in an accident. It premiered at the Raindance Film Festival in September 2015 and was released in April 2016.  Plot  After Jake's father is arrested and goes to jail, Jake inherits his drug business. Although Jake is reluctant to get involved, his friend and roommate Alfie ambitiously plans to expand their empire. While walking home after a drug deal, Jake finds Jade, a young girl, playing alone on a roof. After coaxing her down and making her promise to avoid further trouble, he leaves. After meeting his girlfriend, Kim, he encounters Jade again, this time with her alcoholic father. When Jake objects to his aggressive behavior, Jade's father sucker punches Jake while Jade runs away. Her father threatens to kill him if he interferes again. When Jake arrives at his council estate, he finds Jade sitting by the entrance and invites her inside. After they watch a television show, Jake takes her home. Seeing her father is unconscious, Jake sends her upstairs while he attempts to wake her father. Although Jake is initially relieved when her father recovers, Jake is forced on the defensive as Jade's dad flies into a rage and attacks him. During the scuffle, Jade's father slips and dies when he hits his head. Panicking, Jake hides her father's death from Jade and takes her back to his apartment, where he puts her to bed. Exhausted, he falls asleep on his couch, missing a date with Kim. Alfie, Kim, and Kim's friend Leanne arrive at the apartment. Jake attempts to explain to Alfie what happened but is interrupted. After Alfie and Leanne go to his room to have sex, Jake apologises to Kim, only to be interrupted during sex by Jade. Jake says he is taking care of a relative's child; dubious, Kim leaves. In the morning, Alfie is furious to find that Jake has taken in Jade and insists she leave immediately, fearing she could bring interest from social services. Jake promises to get rid of her, but he is in turn frustrated to hear that Alfie has made overtures to Flowers, a psychopath who Jake's father warned him to avoid. Jake takes Jade with him as he performs drugs deals. Against Jake's orders, she follows him to Flowers' shop. When Jake attempts to back out of the deal Alfie made, Flowers threatens Jade. As Jake and Jade flee, Flowers says Margate is small and has nowhere to hide. When Jake takes Jade back to her house to retrieve her favorite toy, he runs into Mary, Jade's social worker. Jake tell her he is Jade's cousin and babysitting for her father, satisfying her curiosity. Jade eagerly plays along, saying that Jake is a much better guardian than her abusive father. At Jade's urging, the two have a day out at the beach, and Jake treats her to all her favorite activities. Jake takes her with him to meet up with Leanne, Kim, and Alfie. Leanne and Kim are pleased to see Jade again, but Alfie becomes antagonistic. Alfie tells Jade that ecstasy pills are candy and offers them to her. Horrified, the others are too late to stop Jade from eating it. Kim and Jake take her to the hospital. When Jake steps out to call his father for advice, Flowers kidnaps him at gunpoint and drives him outside town. There, Alfie angrily denounces him, saying he believes Flowers is the only way they can get ahead. Flowers initially makes as if to shoot Jake but instead kills Alfie, calling him too ambitious. Impressed that Jake has kidnapped a child, Flowers asks Jake to join him. Jake refuses and escapes. Flowers arrives at the hospital first, and after convincing Kim that he is Jade's father, leaves with Jade. Mary meets with Jake and agrees to listen to his side of the story. Although dubious, she recognises Jake wants to help. When they arrive at the hospital, Jake insists on confronting Flowers alone, though he agrees Mary and Kim can call the police if he does not return in ten minutes. At Flowers' shop, Flowers and Jake get into a fight, and Flowers looks as if to kill Jake. Before he can, Flowers' father kills him, commenting that Flowers was not always so evil. After Flowers' father commits suicide, the cops arrive and arrest Jake amid Jade's protests.

His willingness to challenge the religious establishment of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, specifically in the realms of marriage and conversion, has been controversial.  Marriages  Davidson is one of the few Orthodox rabbis in Israel willing to marry people outside of the Rabbinate. According to Israeli law, marriage that conform to religious standards but are conducted outside of the official religious institutions is punishable with up to 2 years in jail, for both the couple and the officiating clergy. Davidson has publicly conducted over 170 marriages outside of the Rabbinate, and in doing so, has openly challenged the state to jail him. The state has not followed through, even though Davidson has claimed that his ultimate goal in conducting these marriages is to get arrested. Davidson believes the law to be problematic and is confident the courts will strike the law down, however if they do not he is willing to sit in jail as a political prisoner. He is currently serving as head of Chuppot, the wedding division of Hashgacha Pratit, a Jerusalem organization which challenges the monopoly of the Rabbinate. The organization has performed hundreds of marriages around the country, despite the dangers of being jailed by the state.https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5539976,00.html  Conversions  Davidson helped create an organisation called Giyur KeHalacha, which has grown into a network of Orthodox conversion courts that are working independently of the Chief Rabbinate. The organisation gained traction after a number of high-profile rabbis came on board such as Shlomo Riskin. However, Davidson soon left that organisation, partly over their attempts to gain favour with the Chief Rabbinate. He then co-founded a new organisation called Ahavat HaGer, which is an umbrella group of Orthodox rabbis around the world who wish to convert independently of centralized rabbinic organizations, and have agreed to accept any conversion that meets the minimum standard under the Halacha. The organisation connects communities around the world and has rabbis from Israel, United States, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Finland and Sweden as well as Israeli rabbis with communal connections in Germany, Russia, Lithuania, and Netherlands. Davidson is an expert on the laws of conversion having studied them for over a decade. He is also a prot√©g√© of Rabbi Haim Amsalem, and has sat on a number of conversion courts around the world with him. He is also active in training rabbis to perform conversions, and setting out principles to assist other courts. While his adversarial style has alienated him from some authorities, Davidson believes that a forceful approach is needed to break the monopoly of the Chief Rabbis. He has been known to call fellow rabbis clowns, and has called the current Chief Rabbinate an \\"illegitimately coercive institution\\"  Personal life  Davidson grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and studied in Yeshivat Hamivtar before making Aliya in 1991. He currently resides in Beit Shemesh and has 6 children and a number of grandchildren.

In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women. The organization UNESCO has stated that this gender disparity is due to discrimination, biases, social norms and expectations that influence the quality of education women receive and the subjects they study. UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about sustainable development.  Current status of girls and women in STEM education   Overall trends in STEM education  Percentage of students that take advanced courses in mathematics and physics, by sex, Grade 12. Gender differences in STEM education participation are already visible in early childhood care and education in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of education. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence. This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in higher education. Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls‚Äô and women's engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.  Learning achievement in STEM education  In Chile, as in many countries, STEM fields of study are dominated by men Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls‚Äô and women's engagement in these fields. Girls‚Äô achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better. Girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as biology and chemistry but do less well in physics and earth science. The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among TIMSS trend countries: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls‚Äô favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as algebra and geometry but doing less well in \\"number\\". Girls‚Äô performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at a different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and South and West Asia, particularly at the secondary level.  Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education  PISA 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect an ICT career According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: * Individual level: biological factors that may influence individuals‚Äô abilities, skills, and behaviour such as brain structure and function, hormones, genetics, and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation. * Family and peer level: parental beliefs and expectations, parental education and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences. * School level: factors within the learning environment, including teachers‚Äô profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, curricula, learning materials and resources, teaching strategies and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment. * Societal level: social and cultural norms related to gender equality, and gender stereotypes in the media.  Individual level  The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex. Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls‚Äô interest, engagement, and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.  Family and peer level  Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls‚Äô attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents‚Äô expectations, particularly the mother's expectations, have more influence on the higher education and career choices of girls than those of boys. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in mathematics and science for both girls and boys. Girls‚Äô science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers‚Äô higher educational qualifications, and boys‚Äô with their fathers‚Äô. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls‚Äô STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls‚Äô participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls‚Äô motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls‚Äô interest and confidence in mathematics and science.  School level  Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls‚Äô performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers‚Äô beliefs, attitudes, behaviors and interactions with students, as well as Curricula and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counseling and mentoring can expand girls‚Äô understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender stereotypes may negatively affect girls‚Äô performance in STEM. Girls‚Äô learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety. The confidence of a female teacher in STEM subjects also has a strong impact on how well female students will perform in those subjects in the elementary school classroom. For example, female elementary teachers with anxiety around math will negatively affect the achievement of their female students in math. Correlations have been found between gender bias in female elementary students and their achievement in math. Those who had lower achievement over time have also been found to believe that boys are inherently better at math than girls. A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality ‚Äì a gender-equality paradox.  Societal level  Cultural and social norms influence girls‚Äô perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations. The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls‚Äô participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls‚Äô and women's participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and adults and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge gender stereotypes about STEM abilities and careers. In a study conducted women who took exams with men performed worse than women who took exams with other women. Stereotype threat occurs when the individuals are aware that they may be judged based on a stereotype.

The organization was founded in February 2017. The group was known for committing many attacks, at one point they performed attacks on a weekly basis. The group claimed, through their Twitter page, that they recruited members from South Punjab, Balochistan, and Waziristan. The group has also claimed to have ties to Al-Qaeda.  History  The group was founded in February 2017 and originates from the Punjab region in Pakistan. The leaders of the group are claimed to have derived their ideology and tactical methodologies from Osama Bin Laden and his organization, Al-Qaeda. Members of the group allegedly fought for the Islamic State Khurasan, but the organization's brutal tactics drove its members into creating Ansural Sharia Pakistan. The Ansarul Sharia Pakistan group is also known for being the group that the mujahideen group started with, they later splintered off because they were unimpressed with the Ansarul Sharia Pakistan's actions. The group originally consisted of roughly ten to twelve young men who attended various universities in Karachi, Pakistan. The group was known to communicate using smartphone apps and were known to be wearing medallions that held small memory cards that carried important information about the group. Law enforcement has claimed that the group receives a list of targeted killing tasks from abroad. Eight members of the group were killed during a counter-terrorism operation in Karachi. The encounter claimed the life of the group's leader Chief Sheheryar who goes by the alias Dr. Abdullah Hashmi. Another identified from the dead was Arsalan Baig who was known for his activity in the group's targeted killings. After this attack, five people in the group died immediately and three others died while en route to the hospital.  Leadership  The leader of Ansarul Shariah (Pakistan) was Chief Sheheryar. He received his master's degree in applied physics from the University of Karachi. He worked as an information technology expert for the computer department at NED University of Engineering and Technology. Chief Sheheryar was claimed to have been arrested in September 2017. Abdul Karim Sarosh Siddiqui is claimed to have been the mastermind behind the attacks on Khwaja Izhar. He was also a student of applied physics at University of Karachi. Siddiqui was suspected of being close friends with the suspected militant Hassan who died during the attempted assassination of Izharul Hassan. Khwaja Izharul Hassan was the leader of the opposition in the Sindh Assembly.  Claimed Attacks  # In Karachi, the group claimed responsibility for the killing of retired colonel Tahir Zia Nagi around the Baloch Colony area. # The organization attempted an assassination on Khwaja Izharul Hassan, the Pakistan politician who was leading to opposition to the group. During this attack the police were able to chase down and identify one of the attackers. This eventually led to the downfall of the Ansarul Sharia (Pakistan) terrorist organization. # The group has claimed responsibility for the killing of a security guard in Gulistan-i-Jauhar. # The terrorist organization used motorcycles to shoot dead four police officers in Karachi. The attackers left the scene without confrontation. The group left behind pamphlets that stated that they were targeting security forces in the area and claimed responsibility for the attacks. This also led police to determine that the organization was behind the shooting. # Hassan was the leader of the opposition in the Sindh Assembly. This opposition lead to the creation of new record keeping laws in order to track terrorist activity in Karachi.  Culpability for Attacks  # The group was tied to the attack of two New Town policemen. # They are suspected of being responsible for the killing of DSP Traffic and his constable driver in Azizabad. # The organization has been tied to the murder of two employees of the Federal Board of Revenue in Gulistan-i-Jauhar. The employees were sought out because the group suspected them of being policemen. # The group was accused of being responsible for the murder of Qaumi Razakar a police officer who was on the Northern Bypass.

It was selected as the British entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. It was the first time the United Kingdom had submitted an Urdu- language film. Inspiration British-Pakistani filmmaker Sarmad (Sam) Masud, born in Bradford to immigrant parents, based the film on the life of Nazo Dharejo, after reading a 2012 story in The Express Tribune that called her \\"the toughest woman in Sindh.\\" Masud describes the film as \\"a modern-day feminist Western set in Pakistan, based on the extraordinary true story of one woman and her family who defended their home and land from 200 bandits.\\" Plot Nazo Dharejo lives on a farm in rural Sindh, with her parents, two sisters, and an older brother. Early in the film, her father encourages his daughters as well as his son to value the land and be prepared to defend it: \\"\\"No matter what happens, you need to protect this land. This isn't just land. This is your honour.\\" After Nazo's father and brother are arrested, a scheming uncle tries to lay claim to the family farm. Nazo, with her mother and sisters, defends their land, even when it is attacked by 200 mercenaries, hired by the uncle. Reception After its debut showing at the 2017 Edinburgh International Film Festival, My Pure Land was selected as the British entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, marking the first time the United Kingdom had submitted an Urdu language film. Although it did not become one of the Academy's nominees, the \\"Oscar connection\\" helped to boost the film's profile. Reviewers generally praised the film's beauty, its emotional impact, and the acting of Pakistani dancer Suhaee Abro as the teenaged protagonist Nazo Dharejo. The extensive use of flashbacks was interesting to some and confusing to others. The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five, calling it \\"a good idea gone slightly awry.\\" The Times, giving it four out of five stars, called the film \\"lyrical, heart- poundingly tense and strikingly feminist.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 17 critics.

It is also known as the STAL turbine, from the company name STAL (). The technology has had numerous uses since its conception, from power plants to vehicles as large as the supertanker Seawise Giant.Ljungstrom Turbine Grace's Guide Ltd. It was invented circa 1908 by the Swedish brothers Birger Ljungstr√∂m (1872‚Äì1948) and Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m (1875‚Äì1964). The Ljungstr√∂m brothers were creative, time-typical inventors of the 19th century. They not only named the turbine type, but also an early form of a bicycle. Functionality The machine is flowed through steam in radial direction from the inside to the outside and consists of two halves that rotate against each other. As a result, each rotor blade of the one turbine half serves simultaneously as the guide blade of the other half. The different direction of rotation of the two halves is either compensated by a gearbox connected downstream or by separate generators during the generation of electrical power. The Ljungstr√∂m turbine can either be used on a condenser or else for the supply of a district heating grid and is thus flexible to use. It was therefore used in large industrial complexes, which could use both the exhaust of this engine for combined heat and power as well as its electric energy. The functionality has been employed for several power plants. In principle, the maximum power is about 32 MW, since the two turbine halves can not be constructed as large as desired. Coupled with a Parsons turbine, its output can be increased to 50 MW. Since the current steam power plants have a significantly higher performance, the Ljungstr√∂m turbine is generally no longer applied today. The largest ship ever built the ULCC supertanker Seawise Giant was powered by this type of engine.

Charles L√©on Bonvin (February 28, 1834 ‚Äì January 30, 1866) was a French watercolor artist known for genre painting, realist still life and delicate and melancholic landscapes.  Biography  Bonvin was born in Vaugirard (at the time a municipality on the outskirts of Paris, today part of the city) in humble circumstances. He was the son of a constable and a seamstress who owned a poor guinguette. He had numerous siblings and lived in a barren plain; the household money was scarce. As a young boy he began making small charcoal sketches, and gradually ink drawings. His older step brother Fran√ßois Bonvin encouraged him to continue and provided him with paints and the advice to carefully study the old masters of the Dutch Golden Age. He probably attended some of the free classes offered by l'√âcole royale gratuite de dessin created by Bachelier(fr)Bnf, data but was mostly self-taught. He also learned to play music on a harmonium. In 1861 Bonvin married, soon had children, and worked as an innkeeper. The young couple struggled; the inn lost money; anguish set in. Yet painting in the stillness of early morning, at dusk or at night, Bonvin was able to create numerous genre paintings echoing the manner of Jean Sim√©on Chardin, meticulous still life studied with the precision of a botanist and subtle landscapes capturing fleeting atmospheric effects and solitude. These were mostly fragile watercolors for affordability reasons, oil paints being more expensive. He approached gallerists on rue Laffitte and rue du Bac, but he made few sales of his watercolors. In January 1866, Bonvin traveled to Paris again to offer his watercolors to a dealer, who rejected them as too dark. Desperate, he hung himself the next day in the forest, on January 30, 1866, and was discovered a few days later; he was 32 years of age.

The special sale took place at the H√¥tel Drouot in Paris on May 24, 1866.(fr)Gallica, BnF, French archives in La Chronique des arts, 1866-04-29, page 134 Art historian Gabriel P.

L√©on Bonvin's watercolors capture a sense of > the ineffable with a delicacy that belies the destitute circumstances of his > daily life.

Walters, father of Henry Walters, founder of the Walters Art Museum, who acquired some of Bonvin‚Äôs fragile works. His collection eventually comprised 56 watercolors and one, rare oil. Today, it is the largest collection of Bonvin's work in existence. In recent Christie‚Äôs auctions (2007, 2016), a landscape and a self- portrait by Bonvin reached a sale price noticeably above estimates.

History  Origin of military training in South Africa South African military training can be traced back to 1786 when the Militere Kweekskool was established by the Dutch East India Company to develop local cadets, but collapsed due to lack of funds.Roux, P. E. Die Verdedigingstelsel aan die Kaap onder die Hollands-Oos-Indiese Kompanjie Under the Union of South Africa‚Äôs Defence Act of 1912, allowance was made for a formal South African Military College. Two branches were initially set up namely the General Branch or military school and the Musketry Branch or musketry school. Both branches were initially housed in Bloemfontein in the Free State. The military school received its first intake in that same year and by 1913 the musketry school began its first rifle instruction course. The school of musketry eventually became the Weapon Training Branch of the College. Another school was opened for signals training, also in Bloemfontein. All schools eventually were housed on Tempe and placed under a single command. At this stage the unit became known as the South African Military Schools and was now composed of: *General Military Instruction, *Musketry, *Signals and *Medical Training. World War One impact On the outbreak of WW1, training staff were transferred for mobilisation training at Potchefstroom and some served overseas. Developments in the 1920s and 30s By the 1920s the unit was re- established at Roberts Heights near Pretoria and renamed the South African Military School. By 1923, a commissioning course was held, resulting in the school being declared a proper College. =The Air Force connection= An additional wing, the Air Staff Wing was opened for the development of personnel for the emerging South African Air Force, which did not have a training institution of its own at that stage. =Training expansion= By 1939, a further six branches had been created: *Physical Training *Camouflaging, *Armour, *Chemical Warfare, *Regimental and *Commando World War 2 Approximately 150 000 students of all ranks received training at the Army College during the war. Several branches had also become schools in their own right and had moved to premises across South Africa. For example, Signals moved Potchefstroom becoming the Signals Training Centre. By the end of the war however, some branches such as the Chemical Warfare branch had been disbanded.The South African Military College. A brochure compiled by the staff of the College. Government Printer, Pretoria. 1948 Training Developments after the War Branches such as Administration and Ordinance started in the 1950s while joint training between the Army and Air Force came to an end with the eventual establishment of its Air Force College. In 1953 the Weapon Training Branch was redesignated the Infantry School. By the 1960s, Intelligence, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical branches was established as well. The Infantry School had moved to Oudtshoorn in the Cape. Name Change In 1968 the Chief of the Army changed the name of the unit to the South African Army College in order for it to fully develop its now uniquely Army character.  Insignia  The wildebeest as the College‚Äôs symbol had been adopted around 1924. A shoulder flash was developed around 1963 displaying the wildebeest in a roundel of blue and maroon. The Wildebeest concept had originated from a trophy given to the Military School from the Mounted Rifles.

Early life M√§kinen's parents were Counselor Eero M√§kinen and Else M√§kinen (n√©e Westerholm), founders of global stainless steel manufacturer Outokumpu. In 1946, the family moved to Helsinki where M√§kinen began studying at the Helsinki Normal School at the age of 17. He graduated three years later with a Master's of Political Science.  Career  M√§kinen joined the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in February 1950. Shortly thereafter, he became secretary for Prime Minister Urho Kekkonen. He drafted speeches for Kekkonen and prepared him for foreign visits and meetings. The two became friends and remained close until M√§kinen's death. On his first foreign mission, M√§kinen accompanied Kekkonen to Moscow, where he participated in organizing aspects of Joseph Stalin 's funeral in 1953 and, together with Kekkonen, placed the official wreath of Finland on Stalin's coffin. After returning to Finland, M√§kinen became deputy secretary to the Foreign Minister and later was posted to the Finnish Mission in West Germany. From 1960 to 1963, M√§kinen served as a Delegation Counselor at the Finnish Embassy. He worked as now President Kekkonen's interpreter during conversations with the former President of France, Charles de Gaulle, in 1962. In 1963, M√§kinen was appointed Ambassador of Finland to Algeria, which had just won its independence from France the previous year. From Algiers, M√§kinen also handled ambassadorial duties for Tunisia and Lybia, along with other points in the Maghreb and Middle East. In 1968, M√§kinen was posted to Vienna to serve as ambassador to Austria. He also served as the Permanent Representative of Finland to U.N. Headquarters in Vienna and as ambassador to the Holy See. M√§kinen drew attention for travelling between Vienna and Rome by motorcycle. Controversies There were some controversies during this period. In 1969, for example, Finland did not condemn the fire of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the United Nations Security Council. M√§kinen sent a telegram to Rabat, Morocco during the Islamic Conference, but failed to make a statement about Finland's official position. Also, M√§kinen's alcohol consumption and relationships began to attract public and media attention. In one notable incident, M√§kinen was stopped while he and his boyfriend drove naked on his motorbike along the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace park garden. In 1972, M√§kinen accused Romanian officials of planning to murder him. By 1976, Kekkonen was no longer willing to appoint M√§kinen to positions within the Foreign Ministry. Retirement Upon M√§kinen's return to Finland 1976, he withdrew political life. He died in 1978 and was buried at Hietaniemi Cemetery.

Certain modern sources link him (without much justification) to Old King Cole in the synonymous Nursery rhyme. Origins He was the son and heir of Philip Cole (1539‚Äì1596) of Slade by his wife Jane Williams (died 1633), second daughter of Thomas Williams of Stowford. He was a descendant of the Cole family of Nethway in the parish of Brixham in Devon (about 19 miles south east of Slade), one of whom was John Cole (born c.1376), twice a Member of Parliament for Devon, in 1417 and 1423 and Sheriff of Devon 1405-6.History of Parliament biography His distant cousins were the Cole family elevated to the peerage of Ireland successively as Baron Mount Florence (1760), Viscount Enniskillen (1776) and Earl of Enniskillen (1789), descended from Cole of Nethway and Slade,The Genealogie or Pedegree of the Right Worshipfull and Worthie Captaine Sir William Cole of the Castell of Eneskillen in the Countie of Ffermanaugh in the Kingdom of Ireland, Knight, by Sir William Segar, Garter, and William Penson, Lancaster; Copied from the Original Roll, published 1870 still extant today. Career Builds harbour at Bucks Few records of his life survive.

Hubbard-Fielder, The Story of Bucks Mills & Bucks Cross Remains of the quay are visible at low-tide. It was built at about the same time as his near neighbour George Cary (1543‚Äì1601), lord of the manor of Clovelly, Sheriff of Devon in 1587, built a harbour wall at Clovelly surviving today, 3 miles further west along the coast from Bucks, described by Risdon as \\"a pile to resist the inrushing of the sea's violent breach, that ships and boats may with the more safety harbour there\\".Risdon, p.241 Clovelly's main export product was herring fish, which formerly appeared at certain times of the year in huge shoals, close off-shore in the shallow waters of the Bristol Channel, and such a harbour wall was a great benefit to the village fishermen, tenants of the Cary lords of the manor. Supplies weaponry Richard Cole supplied weaponry to the parish armoury of nearby Hartland.Chope, R.Pearse, The Book of Hartland, Torquay, 1940, p.156 From the reign of King Edward I (1272-1307) every parish in England was obliged by law to keep ready for use a certain amount of armour, usually referred to as \\"Church Armour\\", and kept in the parish church or town hall.Chope, p.154 The parish records of Hartland for 1598-9 contain the following two entries relating to Cole:Chope, p.156 *Paid to Richard Cole, Esquior, for a Corslett for the church...xxv shillings *Paid to the said Richard Cole, Esqr, for one hundred poundes of gunpowder for the parish...¬£v. Sells Slade Petersham Church in Surrey of George Cole (d.1624) of the Middle Temple, father of Gregory Cole (d.1660), 2nd cousin and heir of Richard Cole (d.1614) of Bucks According to the Devonshire historian Risdon (died 1640), Richard Cole sold the estate of Slade, which had been the seat of his Cole ancestors from the reign of King Edward II (1307‚Äì1327), which soon afterwards became a seat of the Savery family.Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.192 According to the Devonshire historian Pole (d.1635), Richard Cole \\"conveyed this land\\" (i.e. Bucks and Wallen) \\"unto ....

The large and elaborate monument of George Cole (d.1624) of the Middle Temple, Gregory's father, survives in Petersham Church.

William Loggin, the owner of Bucks in 1822.Lysons, Daniel & Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devonshire, London, 1822, Families removed since 1620) Marriage In 1590 at Penkevil in Cornwall he married Radigan (alias Radagand, etc.) Boscawen, second daughter of Nicholas Boscawen (died 1626) of Penkevil. Her brother Hugh Boscawen (1578‚Äì1641) of Penkevil was Recorder of Truro in Cornwall and was the grandfather of Hugh Boscawen, 1st Viscount Falmouth (c. 1680 ‚Äì 1734).Harding, p.7; Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of Cornwall: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1530, 1573 & 1620; with additions by J.L. Vivian, Exeter, 1887, p.47 The arms of Cole impaling Boscawen (Ermine, a rose gules barbed and seeded proper) are displayed twice on top of his monument in Woolfardisworthy Church. The marriage was without progeny. Radigan survived her husband and remarried (as his second wife) to Sir William Cooke (1572‚Äì) of Highnam in Gloucestershire, Member of Parliament, which marriage was also without progeny. However, she was clearly popular with her two Cooke step-daughters (namely Elizabeth Scudamore of Kentchurch Court in Herefordshire and Ann Ball wife of Peter Ball (died 1680), MP, of Mamhead in Devon) who each named one of their daughters \\"Radagand\\" after her. Death and succession He died without progeny on 19 April 1614,Vivian, p.214 \\"having long languished\\" as he wrote in his will dated 7 January 1612. Legend however states that he was either killed fighting pirates near Bucks Mills, or was killed together with many others at a battle at Bitworthy, near Bucks, the site of which is memorialised by a field named \\"Bloody Park\\".Harding, p.8 It is believed that a survivor from this battle sought refuge in Woolfardisworthy Church, but died from his wounds in the churchyard, having buried his \\"small framed cross\\" in the graveyard.Harding, p.8 This cross was discovered many years later by a vicar's daughter, but was lost in 1993. A field between Bucks and Woolfardisworthy Church has the ancient name \\"Paradise\\", where it is believed a communal graveyard exists for all the men killed at Bitworthy.Harding, p.8 Another story explaining the existence of the cross found in the graveyard is that it came from a Spanish sailor whose warship in the Spanish Armada had been wrecked in a storm off the coast in 1588, who similarly attempted unsuccessfully to reach the sanctuary of the church.Harding, p.8 Monument His large monument with semi-recumbent effigy dressed in armour survives in All Hallows Church, Woolfardisworthy. The monument was said in 1978 to retain the original paintwork.Harding, p.6; dubious as the (gold) bezants in the bordure of the Cole arms are now overpainted in black The Latin inscription etched onto a slate tablet is largely worn away.Visible fragments transcribed in: Harding, T.J., Woolsery Church: The Parish Church of All Hallows, Woolfardisworthy West, A History and Guide, first published 1978, updated and reprinted 2006, pp.6-7 References 1568 births 1614 deaths People from Torridge District ","title":"Richard Cole (died 1614)"},{"id":"55235127","text":"Nadya Khamitskaya (born 21 November 1982 in Belarusian SSR) is a dancer and designer, best known for taking part in TV 2's reality show Skal vi danse.Nadya Khamitskaya: Dansende kjolekunstner , dans.no, 26 April 2011 Khamitskaya has won the Norwegian national dance championships five times.

Early life Fannie Ruth Robinson was born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, on September 30, 1847. In 1859 her parents took up their residence in Albany, New York, and there the formative years of her life were passed. She was graduated at the age of seventeen years from the Albany Female Academy, and later received the degree of A. M. from Rutgers' College, New York. Among the influences which quickened her early ambitions, she recognized three: first, the impulses received from a small circle of men and women, some of whom were very much older than herself; second, the impetus given to youthful ambitions by a class of young people in the alumnae of the female academy, and third, the lift into a rarer air which was hers, happily through many seasons, when Ralph Waldo Emerson and Wendell Phillips, George William Curtiss and Henry Ward Beecher, Chapin and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. went to the capital city at the bidding of the Gloucester Lyceum. Career Fannie Ruth Robinson began to write early. Most of her published poems appeared in Harper's Magazine in the years between 1870 and 1880, during which time she wrote occasionally for the \\"Contributor's Club\\" of the Atlantic Monthly. Her poem, \\"A Quaker's Christmas Eve,\\" was copied in almost every city in the Union. Albany twice paid her the honor of asking for her verse, once for the services of the first Decoration Day, and again when an ode was to be written for the ceremony of laying the corner-stone of the capitol. In 1879 she began to teach, and since then she wrote little for publication. A poem on Emerson, published after his death in the Journal of Philosophy, was considered one of her best. Two of her sonnets found place in the collection of Representative American Sonnets, made in 1890 by Charles Henry Crandall. She was preceptress of Ferry Hall Seminary, the woman's department of Lake Forest University, Lake Forest, Illinois, a position she held since 1868. Later she was president of the Oxford College, Hamilton, Ohio, until 1893 when she was replaced by Jane B. Sherzer. In 1895 she was principal of the Michigan Seminary. Robinson moved in 1901 to the position of president of the Oxford College for Young Ladies, succeeding Dr. J. H. Thomas and in 1904 she became principal of college, reorganized by John F. Fenton. In 1905 she resigned. She was a member of the Woman's Educational Auxiliary of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.

In 2006, a military parade was held in the traditional style and order on Bishkek's Ala-Too Square, which was deemed \\"irresponsible\\" by opposition lawmaker Omurbek Tekebaev due to the fact that it coincided with opposition protests against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.

The massive tower offers an effective lookout point even today. Early History The building is said to have belonged to Stefano Quadrio and is known as the Castionetto or Roncisvalle tower, the latter evoking the legendary route of Roncesvalles in Navarre, Spain. The tower is mentioned in notarial deeds in the Middle Ages, one such document, drawn up in 1460, states a sale by Maria Maffina to Andrea Maffina, and the property comprised: a vineyard, fields, woodlands, shed, threshing barn, stable with hayloft, indoor kitchen with hearth, two courtyards, and right of way, located in the Castionetto district \\"ubi dictor ad dossum majorem seu ad Ronzivallem\\".Medievale deed 1460 [\\"known as Dosso Maggiore, and near to Roncisvalle\\"]. The Italian philologist, semiotician and literary critic Cesare Segre attributes the name Roncisvalle to \\"roscida valle\\", meaning a damp valley, and to \\"roscidare\\", meaning to irrigate, but also to \\"ronco\\", \\"runchet\\" from \\"runcare\\", to till a ground for planting new vines. The stylized map shows the historical names of the paths that departed from the tower The square-plan tower is eleven metres in length and width, and fifteen metres high, and far more imposing than those surviving at Teglio, Castello dell'Acqua, the two towers that are part of the respective Grumello castles, the Mancapane tower above Montagna, the two Castel Masegra towers, the Santa Maria di Tirano castle tower, and the Bellaguarda castle tower at Tovo di Sant'Agata. Given the sturdiness of the structure, with walls as thick as two and a half metres at the base, the tower must certainly have played a defensive as well as an observation role. Indeed, in 1487, defended by Zenone Groppello, the tower served as a precious bulwark against the invasion attempted by Grisons. The tower was restored in more recent times, after centuries of neglect, and reopened to the public in May 2003. Tower Design The design aspects of the tower are significant, imitating forms of construction inspired by Lombard architectural traditions, highlighted by the materials used and by the quality of the details, like the ogival windows outlined with close-set ashlars. The fa√ßades have a uniform appearance thanks to the building method of standardized measures and materials, clearly seen in the stone courses and the cornerstones with characteristic bosses. The opening on the first floor was originally the entrance, accessed by a drawbridge operated from a niche above it. Today's entrance corresponds to an earlier opening. The ground floor and the first floor are barrel vaulted and a stone staircase leads up to the second floor. No known documents establish the tower's construction period, although scholars agree that it can be dated thirteenth‚Äìfifteenth century, the period of greatest prosperity for the Quadrio family, settled down at Chiuro at the time. The Quadrios were originally from Como, and left the city in the twelfth century, because of the Guelph‚ÄìGhibelline feuds. From the end of the 1300s to the first half of the 1400s, the military captain Stefano Quadrio led the village of Chiuro into a thriving economic and political period. Stefano owned a castle in Sazzo, a district of Ponte in Valtellina, but in what is now Via Torre there are the remains of his fortified mansion, built \\"ad Visnatem\\" [the Vicinate quarter, later Canterana or Cantarana ‚Äì a compound of \\"cantare\\" and \\"rana\\" referring to the frogs that chirped in the canals whose water supplied blacksmiths]. Chiuro was dotted with towers whose lower sections are visible in later buildings erected on them. In his Castelli e Torri Valtellinesi [Castles and Towers of Valtellina], Egidio Pedrotti writes that Zenone Gropello ‚Äì a Sforza family military commander ‚Äì used the tower and the Chiuro fortifications as a base, following the first Grisons attack of Valtellina, in 1486‚Äì7. It is likely that during Grisons rule, the Castionetto tower suffered the same fate as the fortifications in the province of Sondrio since the invaders reinforced their control by neutralizing the military features of occupied territories. n a document dated 1622, kept in the Chiuro archives, the tower is listed as the property of the religious order \\"Scuola del Rosario\\", which owned the building and surrounding land until the early 1800s, when it became the property of the \\"Scuola del SS. Sacramento\\".Document dated 1622 from Castionetto di Chiuro's parish archive By the first half of the nineteenth century, the Lombardy‚ÄìVeneto land registers listed the lands as the property of the municipality of Chiuro.Lombard's cadastre In 1885, the Lavizzari title deed states that the land and the tower had been expropriated and had become municipal property Modern Period Subsequently the tower fell into neglect although it lost none of its monumental character. Restoration work carried out in the early 2000s, funded under Law No 102/90 (better known as the Valtellina Act), restored the tower to public use and ensured its preservation as a monument.

He served as an IRGC adviser to the pro-government forces in Syria during the Syrian Civil War. He was captured by ISIS forces near al-Tanf in southeast Syria, and was beheaded two days later. ISIS published a video of his capture, a picture of which went viral among Iranians in social media. The publicized captivity and his following death received widespread reaction among the Iranian people, government, and military. Death Mohsen Hojaji was an IRGC member operating in Syria as part of an advisory team to the pro-government forces during the Syrian Civil War. On 7 August 2017, ISIS led a surprise attack near al-Tanf, Syria near the Syrian-Iraqi border against a pro- government outpost comprising IRGC military advisers, including Hojaji. After two hours of fighting, a suicide ISIS operative infiltrates and leaves a number of people killed. Hojaji himself was wounded at his side and the right arm, according to the commander of his division, and was taken as captive after being surrounded by ISIS members. ISIS published a video of the attack and the capture of Hojaji. Hojaji was beheaded two days later. Reactions A picture of the second video went viral in social media. It shows an ISIS fighter with a knife at hand holding Hojaji, who is dressed in military uniform and gazing at the camera, with black smoke rising from the overtaken camp. Many compared the expressions of the ISIL soldier, who looks \\"anxious\\", with that of Hojaji. The picture was also interpreted from religious aspect, with an artistically modified version by Hassan Rouholamini going viral, showing Hojaji being welcomed by a beheaded Imam Hossein, a seventh century martyr and key figure of the Shia Islam, who was killed in a similar scene. Hojaji's captivity and ensuing death received widespread reaction among people and government of Iran, including senior figures and IRGC commanders, such as Hassan Rouhani's vice president, commander of IRGC Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of the IRGC Ground Forces, Mohammad Pakpour, head of Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, who sent a message to Hajaji's wife and son, and the Iranian Army. Many Iranian celebrities, artists, and sports people also reacted to the incident, such as the footballer Mehdi Taremi, singer and musician Alireza Assar, and Rambod Javan. Reactions from outside Iran include Syrian ambassador to Iran Adnan Hassan Mahmoud and Iraqi cleric and politician Ammar al-Hakim. Hojaji's funeral in Isfahan In a statement issued on August 31, the public relations department of the IRGC Ground Force said a DNA test confirmed the identity of the body delivered to the Lebanese Hezbollah earlier in the day as Mohsen Hojaji. Hezbollah received the body of Hojaji from Daesh based on a ceasefire deal between the two sides. The transfer of Lebanon's captured soldiers and two martyrs, as well as the body of Hojaji, took place after the buses carrying Daesh militants and their families arrived in the ancient city of Palmyra in Homs. A funeral procession was held for Hojaji in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on September 27, 2017. Thousands of people took to the streets for his funeral. The funeral began from the Imam Hussein square in downtown Tehran. Ali Khamenei prayed over Hojaji's casket and spoke to his family, praising their fortitude. Many Iranian artists memorialized his death in videos and paintings. Following the funeral procession, Hojaji was laid to rest on September 28, 2017. He was buried in his hometown of Najaf Abad in Isfahan Province in central Iran.

In particular, the initiative addresses five main concerns: * What are the best ways to safeguard data? * How do federal agencies play a crucial role in collecting, managing, and distributing data? * How do government priorities impact data's accessibility? * Which projects and research fields depend on federal data? * Which data sets are of value to research and local communities, and why? Data Refuge began as a grassroots organization in opposition to government data on climate change and the environment not being archived systemically. Data Refuge's main goal is to collect and allocate data in multiple safe locations to create a sustainable way of archiving old and new data. Data Refuge was initiated in 2016 to protect federal climate and environmental data that is vulnerable under an administration that denies climate change. The system aims to make public research-quality copies of federal climate and environmental data. Data Refuge is supported by the National Geographic Foundation, private donors, Libraries+ Network, Preserving Electronic Governance Initiative (PEGI), the Union of Concerned Scientists (USC), and the Penn Program in Environmental Humanities (PPEH).  Types of data  Data Refuge collects public federal data on the climate and environment in the form of satellite imagery, PDFs, and stories. The data are stored in multiple trusted locations as they are less vulnerable if in only one location, and to ensure accessibility for researchers. Through the Data Rescue events, Data Refuge has accumulated 4 terabytes of data, 30,000 URLs, and 800 participants.  Storytelling Data Refuge collects stories on vulnerable federal climate and environmental data through: surveys, oral history, photo essays, maps, video shorts, and animations. The stories are archived in a public bank that showcase how federal environmental data support health and safety in communities. Data Stories are collected at Data Rescue events, which are partnered with universities, city and town halls, and advocacy groups. Data stories are collected and used to emphasize the importance of Data Refuge, in how the data on climate change and the environment are being used by people in the United States and across the world for meaningful practices.

Maulavi Ahmadullah Shah was known as the Lighthouse of Rebellion in Awadh region. British officers like George Bruce Malleson and Thomas Seaton have made mentions about courage, valour, personal and organizational capabilities of Ahmadullah. G. B. Malleson has repeatedly mentioned Ahmadullah in the History of Indian Mutiny, a book written in 6 volumes covering Indian revolt of 1857. Thomas Seaton describes Ahmadullah Shah as: With being a practicing Muslim, he was also an epitome of religious unity and Ganga-Jamuna culture of Faizabad. In the rebellion of 1857, royalties like Nana Sahib and Khan Bahadur Khan fought alongside Ahmadullah. The British could never catch Maulvi alive. The price of 50,000 pieces of silver was announced to capture him. Finally the king of Powayan Raja Jagannath Singh killed Maulvi, beheaded and presented his head to the magistrate. Raja Jagannath was paid announced prize. Next day, the head of Maulvi was hanged at Kotwali.  Family  The family of Ahmadullah was original inhabitant of Gopaman in Hardoi Province. His father Ghulam Hussain Khan was a senior official in Haider Ali's army. His forefathers were big exponents of weaponry. G. B. Malleson describes personality of Maulvi as > The Moulvi was a remarkable person. His name was Ahmad-ullah and his native > place was Faizabad in Oudh. In person, he was tall, lean and muscular, with > large deep eyes, beetle brows, a high aquiline nose, and lantern jaws. Maulvi was a Sunni Muslim and belonged to an affluent family. He had a good command over English. After getting his traditional Islamic education, Maulvi had got training on welfare as well. He travelled to England, Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq, Mecca and Medina, and also performed Hajj. Before 1857 Revolt Maulvi believed that for the success for an armed rebellion, the co-operation of people was very important. He travelled to Delhi, Meerut, Patna, Calcutta and several other places and sowed the seed of independence. Maulvi and Fazl- e-Haq Khairabadi also declared jihad against Britons. He also authored a pamphlet called Fateh Islam, planned manner for the need of jihad against Britisher, even before the eruption of revolt in 1857. According to G. B. Malleson, \\"It is beyond doubt that behind the conspiracy of 1857 revolt, Moulavi's brain and efforts were significant. Distribution of bread during the campaigns, Chapati Movement, was actually his brainchild.\\" Arrest at Patna According to G. B. Malleson, when Maulvi was in patna, suddenly with no previous notice or intimation, an officer arrived at Patna from Punjab. He is referred as Lt. Thursbern in a book by Rashmi Kumari on Ahmadullah Shah. With a warrant in his pocket, he walked into Sadikpur, a quarter in Patna. He entered house of Ahmadullah Shah, and with the help of police arrested Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah. Maulvi was awarded capital death punishment on the charges of revolt and conspiracy against the British rule. The punishment was later reduced to life imprisonment. After eruption of revolt on 10 May 1857, Rebel sepoys of Azamgarh, Banaras and Jaunpur reached Patna on 7 June. They attacked the bungalows of English officers who were already on the run. Once the city was captured by the rebels, they captured the government treasury. They proceeded towards the jail and got Maulvi and other prisoners freed. After declaring Mansingh as Raja of Patna, maulavi Ahmadullah proceeded to Awadh. Indian Rebellion of 1857 and 1858 The rebel army of Awadh was led by Barkat Ahmad and Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah. In the Battle of Chinhat, Barkat Ahmad was declared Chief Army Officer of the rebels. Britisher army was led by Henry Montgomery Lawrence who eventually died in The Residency, Lucknow. This fierce battle was won by rebel army in the leadership of Barkat Ahmad and Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah. Ahmadullah Shah also led an attack on Beligarad. The writer Kaisaruttawarikh states that it was a huge victory for the rebels. > Maulavi fought with great courage and chivalry in real sense, and for that > he succeeded in pushing the British to beligarad. And then a big house of > \\"Machchhi Bhavan\\" was also blown up. After Lucknow was captured by rebels, Birjis Qadr, ten-year-old son of Wazid Ali Shah and Begum Hazrat Mahal was declared a king. Maulavi resisted being part of new administration. He went away from the palace politics and established his camp with Ghamandi Singh and 1000 soldiers of subedar Umrao Singh in Badshah Bagh beyond river Gomati. On 6 March 1858, Britishers attacked Lucknow again under the leadership of Sir Colin Campbell, a reputed British army official. The rebel army was led by Begum Hazrat Mahal. With the Capture of Lucknow by the British, the rebels escaped on 15 and 16 March through a road leading to Faizabad. The last rebels, 1,200 men under Ahmadullah Shah were driven from a fortified house in the centre of the city on 21 March. The city was declared cleared on this date. After fall of Lucknow, maulavi shifted his base to Shahjahanpur, Rohilkhand. In Shahjahanpur, forces of Nana Sahib and Khan Bahadur Khan also joined maulavi in attacking Britishers. Colin Campbell departed from Shahjahanpur on 2 May towards Bareilly. Maulvi, with king of Mohammadi and several thousand soldiers attacked Shahjahanpur. The British Army was informed and General Brigadier John reached Shahjahanpur on 11 May. Jones could not muster courage to attack moulavi and kept waiting for more assistance from Bareilly. George Bruce Malleson writes that: > Maulavi was the only one who could have dared to defeat Sir Colin Campbell > twice. The fierce battle took place on 15 May 1858 between platoon of rebels and regiment of General Brigadier Jones. Both sides had to bear heavy losses but rebels still controlled Shahjahanpur. Colin reached Shahjahanpur on 20 May, and attacked Shahjahanpur from all sides. This battle continued all night long. Maulavi and Nana Sahib left Shahjahanpur. It is said that Colin himself followed maulvi but couldn't capture him. After fall of Shahjahanpur, maulvi left for Powayan which was situated 18 miles north of Shahjahanpur. Death The British could never catch Maulvi alive. They announced 50,000 pieces of silver as a prize to capture maulvi. Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah wanted to induce The king of Powayan, Raja Jagannath Singh to revolt against Britishers, but the latter did not give into the Maulvi's wishes. When Maulvi reached gates of his palace on his war elephant, king attacked him by firing a cannon shot. This killed maulvi who came down falling from his elephant. G. B. Malleson describes his death as: The brother of The king of Powayan Raja Jagannath Singh, Kunwar Baldeo Singh killed Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah, beheaded him and presented it to the magistrate. He was paid announced prize and gained favour of the British. The head of Maulvi was hanged at kotwali next day. Another revolutionary of 1857 Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi witnessed the death of maulvi.

The ritual serves as a way of expressing appreciation to their gods, whom they believe have granted them with blessings, abundance, and welfare. The Tenggerese live in sixty villages around the Tengger mountains (Mount Bromo) in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, comprising the regencies of Probolinggo, Lumajang, and Pasuruan, as well as the city of Malang, East Java, Indonesia. Administratively, the festival location takes place in the Probolinggo Regency in East Java. History The origin of this festival is a legend that dates back to the Majapahit kingdom, during the reign of King Brawijaya. At the fall of the Majapahit empire the princess of the kingdom and her husband Roro Anteng took refuge in the upper slopes of Mount Bromo. The couple and their followers later settled in the Tengger mountains and ruled the region jointly under the title Purbawisesa Mangkurat Ing Tengger. Under their leadership Tenngerese people settled and began to flourish, but the couple were not happy as they remained childless after many years of marriage. Therefore, they meditated atop Mount Bromo, beseeching the mountain gods for assistance. The gods granted them 24 children on the condition that the 25th child must be thrown into the volcano as human sacrifice. The gods‚Äô request was observed, and so the tradition of offering sacrifices thrown into the volcano to appease the deities continues until today, but, of course, with no sacrifices of humans. Instead, today chickens, goats and vegetables are thrown into the crater as sacrifice. According to another version of the legend the couple didn't follow the promise. God becomes angry with threatening to inflict catastrophe, then there is a tempestuous circumstances into a pitch black crater of Mount Bromo sprayed fire. Their youngest son Kesuma vanished from the sight of the fire and into the crater of Bromo, along with Kesuma's disappearance came the unseen voice, \\"My dear friends, I have been sacrificed by our parents and Sang Hyang Widhi saved all of you.Live peace and serenity, worship the Sang Hyang Widhi, I remind you every month of Kasada on the 14th day to make offerings to Sang Hyang Widhi in the crater of Mount Bromo \\". Pura Luhur Poten Poten is a sacred area of land in the \\"Sea of Sand\\" ( or ), which becomes place for Kasada festival. On the sand plain, locally called Segara Wedi (lit. sand ocean), sits a Hindu temple called Pura Luhur Poten. The temple organises the Yadnya Kasada ritual which lasts for about one month. On the 14th day, the Tenggerese congregate at Pura Luhur Poten to ask for blessings from Ida Sang Hyang Widi Wasa and the God of Mahameru (Mount Semeru). The temple consists of several buildings and enclosures arranged in a composition arrangement in the yard which is divided into three mandala (zone), Mandala Utama , Mandala Madya and Mandala Nista . Festival Eksotika Bromo Festival is held as part Yadnya Kasada ritual that is organized by the regency administration to develop traditional culture and art activities in the community to help lure tourists to the region. It is held prior to the Yadnya Kasada ritual. Various type of traditional arts and cultural programs are presented to celebrate this festival. The festival attracts huge numbers of local as well as foreign tourists every year. Ritual Trail leads to Mount Bromo Yadnya Kasada is held every 14th day of the Kasada Month in the traditional Tengger calendar. This ceremony is held to honor Sang Hyang Widhi, God Almighty, and is based on the ancient legend of Roro Anteng and Joko Seger. Pendopo Agung Desa Ngadisari (Ngadisari village Grand Hall) became the starting point of the Yadnya Kasada procession. Offerings began to be distributed to the Luhur Poten temple at the sand grounds which is known as Poten, right at the bottom of Mount Bromo. Following the ritual, the Tengger tribe shamans, local public figures, and Tenggerese people gather and pray for their safety and prosperity. On the day of Yadnya Kasada, devotees who have journeyed up the mountain, pray together atop the mountain and then throw their offerings into the crater of the volcano. On the 14th day of the Kasada, the Tenggerese go to Poten Bromo and ask for blessing from the main deity Hyang Widi Wasa and Mahadeva, the God of the Mountain (Mount Semeru), by offerings sacrifices, which include vegetables, fruit, livestock, flowers as well as money, and are offered in grateful thanks for an abundance of agricultural produce and livestock given to them. Sometimes locals clamber down into the crater despite obvious dangers, to retrieve the sacrificed goods, which are believed to bring them good luck.

This species is an unspecialized saprophytic mold, mostly found outdoors in areas of rich soil with decaying plant material as well as in dry grain storage facilities. Often confused with the closely related species, A. flavus, A. parasiticus has defined morphological and molecular differences. Aspergillus parasiticus is one of three fungi able to produce the mycotoxin, aflatoxin, one of the most carcinogenic naturally occurring substances. Environmental stress can upregulate aflatoxin production by the fungus, which can occur when the fungus is growing on plants that become damaged due to exposure to poor weather conditions, during drought, by insects, or by birds. In humans, exposure to A. parasiticus toxins can cause delayed development in children and produce serious liver diseases and/or hepatic carcinoma in adults. The fungus can also cause the infection known as aspergillosis in humans and other animals. A. parasiticus is of agricultural importance due to its ability to cause disease in corn, peanut, and cottonseed. History and taxonomy Aspergillus parasiticus was first discovered in 1912 by pathopathologist, A.T Speare from dead mealy bugs collected on Hawaiian sugarcane plantations. The species epithet, \\"parasiticus\\" is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"parasite\\" and was selected due to the ability of the fungus to parasitize other organisms. The fungus was originally classified as a subspecies of A. flavus called Aspergillus flavus subsp. parasiticus (Speare) due to its strong resemblance to A. flavus. Indeed, this fungus is very closely related to A. flavus and is often misidentified as the latter. However, the two species are separable based on morphological features. A. parasiticus also exhibits physiological differences from A. flavus such as the inability to produce cyclopiazonic acid and the production of aflatoxin G. Growth and morphology The conidia of A. parasiticus have rough, thick walls, are spherical in shape, have short conidiophores (~400 Œºm) with small vesicles averaging 30 Œºm in size to which the phialides are directly attached. A. parasiticus is further distinguished by its dark green colony colour. Aspergillus parasiticus colonies are dark green. The average growth temperature for this fungus ranges between 12-42 ¬∞C with the optimum temperature for growth is at 32 ¬∞C and no growth reported at 5 ¬∞C. Growth pH ranges from 2.4-10.5 with the optimum growth ranging between 3.5-8. For the best growth of the fungus the carbon and nitrogen content in the soil is 1:1 and the pH 5.5. A. parasiticus normally reproduces asexually however, the presence of single mating genes MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 in different strains of the fungus suggests it has a heterothallic mating system and may have a hitherto unrecognized teleomorph. A. parasiticus grows on cereal agar, Czapek agar, malt extract agar, malt salt agar, and potato dextrose agar. The sclerotia and stromata transform from white to pink, dark brown and black. When grown on \\"Aspergillus flavus and parasiticus\\" agar (AFPA), colonies show an orange yellow reverse colouration. The conidia are pink when grown on media containing anisaldehyde. A. parasiticus has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below. Aspergillus_parasiticus_cya.pngAspergillus parasiticus growing on CYA plate Aspergillus_parasiticus_meaox.pngAspergillus parasiticus growing on MEAOX plate Physiology A. parasiticus produces aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2, named for the colours emitted under UV light on thin-layer chromatography plates‚Äîeither blue and green. The numbers refer to the type of compound with 1 being major and 2 being minor. These aflatoxins are carcinogenic mycotoxins which have detrimental effects to humans and livestock. A. parasiticus also has the ability to produce kojic acid, aspergillic acid, nitropropionic acid and aspertoxin as secondary antimicrobial metabolites in response to different environments, all of which can be useful in identification. A. parasiticus also differs in sclerotia quantity number, volume, and shape. This fungus can be reliably identified using molecular methods. A. parasiticus produces aflatoxins at higher concentrations than A. flavus in temperatures ranging from with pH ranging from 3 to greater than 8. Light exposure, oxidative growth conditions, fungal volatiles and nutrient availability (sugars and zinc) affect the production of these toxins. Greater zinc availability increases aflatoxin output. Environmental stress caused by drought and/or high temperatures during the latter part of the growing season of crops increases the likelihood of fungal growth. The aflatoxins produced by A. parasiticus are hazardous under normal food handling conditions and are especially stable when absorbed by starch or protein on the surfaces of seeds. Signs and symptoms Often, food illnesses are not attributed to A. parasiticus because it is mistaken for A. flavus. Serious symptoms of aflatoxin exposure by either ingestion or inhalation of spores, or through direct skin contact, can occur amongst humans and animals. Signs and symptoms of exposure in humans may include delayed development and stunted growth among children, while adults may experience teratogenic effects, lung damage, ulcers, skin irritation, fever, and acute liver disease, which can later lead to liver carcinoma and death. Control and management Most countries put low limits on how much aflatoxin is allowed to be in food. This fungus has low resistance to heat, so in order to reduce aflatoxin levels and its toxic effects, foods such as peanuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, pistachios, and pecans can be roasted, can be treated with an alkali such as ammonia, or the crops can be given a microbial treatment. The growth of this fungus can be prevented by proper water management and dust reduction. Corn contaminated by A. parasiticus can be pasteurized by exposure to radio frequency (although any mycotoxins produced in situ will remain intact). Exposure of the fungus to phenolic compounds destabilizes the cellular lipoprotein membrane by increasing hydrophobicity, resulting in a lengthened lag phase, reduction of growth rate and diminished aflatoxin production. Similarly, exposure to phytochemicals such as ascorbic acid, gallic acid, caffeine, and quercetin reduces the growth rate of A. parasiticus. Habitat and ecology Aspergillus parasiticus can be found outdoors commonly within an agricultural setting of soil on fields and through the improper handling, drying, transportation and storage of grains and fresh produce. This fungus is also commonly found on the stems and roots of peanuts and other plants. A. parasiticus is a tropical and subtropical species found in the United States, Latin America, South Africa, India and Australia. This species has rarely been reported from Southeast Asia and cool temperate zones. Fungal spores can be distributed with the wind as well as through moist soil via contact with nuts and kernels, and can survive over the winter months on plant material on the soil.

In 923 he sent for the pallium to Pope John X. who addressed it to him with letters confirming the privileges of his Church. Archbishop Seulfe, who was of a haughty and proud character, having imagined that Odon and Hervee, one brother and the other nephew of his predecessor Hervee, lacked the respect and fidelity which they had, as vassals of the Church of Reims, summoned them to come and justify themselves or to fight in duel to prove their innocence. They did neither one nor the other. On their refusal, after having deprived them of the property which they held in fiefs of the Church of Reims, they alone imprisoned them. This procession rendered this prelate odious, and it was published that, in order to obtain the detention of these two lords, he had promised the Earl of Vermandois to have his son archbishop of Reims elected.

She gave recitals at both Carnegie And Town Halls and was highly praised by the New York Critics.\\" Her obituary in The New York Times reported, \\"In 1937, she turned down an opportunity to join the Metropolitan Opera in order to stay in broadcasting.\\" Radio Kitchell's obituary in Variety noted that her \\"voice was transmitted by the Amateur Radio Corps of America from an experimental station off the New York Harbor in 1917 ‚Äî before most Americans knew what radio was.\\" She began performing regularly as a singer on radio in 1927, starting a span of two decades that brought her the appellation \\"Golden Voice of Radio\\". An item in the March 1930 issue of Radio Revue said, \\"This charming NBC contralto delights those who tune in on the Sunday Symphonette with her rich renditions of only the best music.\\" Kitchell joined the staff of WJZ in New York City as a singer and over time became the hostess of programs aimed at women, a transition made possible by \\"her curiosity, warm enthusiasm for new things, and friendly personality\\". Her success in that genre led to speaking engagements for clubs at colleges, women's groups, and other organizations. In 1938, she created her own program, Brief Case, answering questions about radio that listeners had submitted and explaining behind-the- scenes activity. In 1938, she interviewed prominent women on Let's Talk It Over, \\"one of the original radio talkshows\\". At that time, she had already made more than 3,000 broadcasts on NBC. Kitchell began Pin Money Party on NBC- Red on September 30, 1940. The program advised women about \\"how to earn money on talents developed in the home\\". On June 21, 1943, WJZ launched Woman's Exchange, \\"a clearing house for the interchange of ideas among the housewives of the vast WJZ coverage area ... to help them in their wartime food and household problems.\\" Kitchell was the hostess. Also in the early 1940s, she was host of Meet Your Neighbor on NBC-Blue. Beginning in 1944, Kitchell had a syndicated program, Come and Get It, which was described as the \\"first recorded audience participation show\\". Seventy-eight 15-minute episodes were distributed by NBC Radio-Recording Division. The program was also broadcast in Canada, with distribution by All-Canada Radio Facilities, Limited. Television On June 20, 1939, Kitchell performed in the role of Ruth in an NBC production of The Pirates of Penzance, the first operetta presented on television. Kitchell left radio to become hostess of In the Kelvinator Kitchen, an NBC program that was described as \\"typical of a 'homemaker' genre on TV in which a housekeeping skill was demonstrated, often using the sponsor's products.\\" Mary Ellen Snodgrass, in her book, Encyclopedia of Kitchen History, cited the program as \\"the first commercial network series and first televised cooking show on the air.\\" In 1948, Kitchell told an interviewer from Radio and Television Mirror magazine that she valued \\"The highly personalized relationship between the performer and the viewer,\\" adding, \\"You are not just heard in people's homes ‚Äî you are there.\\" Non- performing professional activities Beginning in 1945, Kitchell served as president of the Association of Women Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters. Personal life Kitchell was married to Charles Kitchell, and they had two sons. He died in 1956, and she married Joseph Yoder in 1965. Death On November 13, 1996, Kitchell died at her home in Sarasota, Florida. She was survived by two sons, four grandchildren, and four great- grandchildren.

In 900, he was consecrated archbishop of Reims, holding this position until his death. Heriveus's tenure was marked by the genesis of the duchy of Normandy and the growing discord between the Carolingian king Charles the Simple and his Robertian rival Robert of Neustria. Biography Heriveus was born to a noble Frankish family. The Reims historian Flodoard, who knew Heriveus well, states that he was the nephew of Hucbald, count of Ostrevent and Senlis, who was a son-in-law of Eberhard of Friuli. Heriveus is attested as a notary in the office of King Odo in 894, serving under the archchancellor Walter of Sens. After Charles the Simple succeeded Odo in 898, Heriveus continued to serve in the royal chancery, now led by Fulk of Reims. Following Fulk's murder in 900, Heriveus succeeded him as archbishop of Reims, and was ordained by the suffragan bishops of the province on 6 July 900. As archbishop, Heriveus was a committed pastor and effective administrator. He oversaw several translations of saints' relics, including the movement of the body of St Remigius to a new position behind the altar in the abbey of Saint- Remi. He rebuilt several Reims fortifications which had been damaged or destroyed by the Vikings, including that at Mouzon on the river Meuse. In 902, he concluded an agreement with Archbishop Hatto of Mainz concerning the church of Reims's property rights in the Vosges and dedicated a new church in Kusel. In 909, Heriveus convened a provincial synod at Trosly. The surviving acts state that the council had been called in order to address the recent devastation wrought upon the region by the Vikings and to condemn other moral failings. Heriveus and his provincial bishops implored clerics to avoid sinful behavior and laymen to respect ecclesiastical property and rights, and called for monasticism to be revived. In 911, following the Siege of Chartres, where Robert of Neustria and Richard, Duke of Burgundy defeated the Northmen, King Charles the Simple agreed the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with the Norman leader Rollo, ceding him the city of Rouen and territories along the Seine which would become the duchy of Normandy. Heriveus participated in this process, and continued to correspond with Archbishop Witto of Rouen on the matter of the Normans' conversion to Christianity. For most of his episcopacy, Heriveus remained a loyal supporter of Charles the Simple. In 920, many of his Charles's nobles were alienated by the king's favoritism of the upstart Count Hagano. Heriveus played a key role in effecting a reconciliation. In 922, however, the nobles again rebelled, and this time Heriveus too broke from the king, rallying behind Robert, duke of the Franks and brother of the late king Odo, Heriveus and other nobles dramatically defected. Robert was crowned king at the abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims by Archbishop Walter of Sens on 29 June 922. Heriveus was evidently in ill health at this time, for he died just days later on 2 July. He was succeeded in the archbishopric by Seulf.

She was one of six children born to the gentleman-farmer and high-profile oologist Wilhelm von Nathusius (1821-1899) by his marriage to Marie von Meibom (1820‚Äì1878). A younger brother, Wilhelm von Nathusius (1856-1937), became an army officer. Her sister, Susanne von Nathusius (1850-1929) became a successful portrait artist in Halle. Elsbeth herself remained unmarried and had no children. Evidence of Elsbeth charms as a small child comes from the poet and writer of children's songs, August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, who visited her father in 1847 and dedicated twelve songs (including \\"For Elsbeth Nathusius\\") to the infant in a volume published under the title \\"The Elsbeth Album\\".Heinrich Gerstenberg, Hoffmann's von Fallersleben gesammelte Werke.

During the 1880s, using the pseudonym F.L.Born, Nathusius published stories in Daheim, a well-regarded fortnightly \\"Family magazine\\".

Mashaei followed orders to resign. Ahmadinejad then appointed Mashaei as chief of staff, and fired Mohseni-Eje'i.

Sousan Keshavarz, Mohammad Aliabadi, and Fatemeh Ajorlou were not approved by Parliament for the Ministries of Education, Energy, and Welfare and Social Security respectively.

He hosts an online talk show named the Ghanem Show, which features segments such as \\"Fadfada\\" where he criticizes the Saudi royal family (especially the King Salman and his Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman) through the use of black comedy. Background Al- Masarir left his hometown of Al-Kharj in 2003, in order to study computer science at the University of Portsmouth.YouTube Star Skewers Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom Fights Back, by David Segal, Jan. 3, 2020 The New York Times In 2012 he applied for political asylum in Britain, which was granted in 2018. Media and Political Satirists Al-Dosari has been based in London since 2003 in self-imposed exile, where he has operated his YouTube-based talk show since 2015. In his talk show, al-Dosari criticizes the Saudi royal family, in particular King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad, whom he labels as \\"Salmanco\\" (referring to the methods exercised by the King in managing the country in a fashion similar to a company or as personal possession) and \\"al-Dub al-Dasher\\" (fat crumpet) respectively in a humorous manner, \\"exposes secrets\\" related to the royal family, and calls for protests against the Saudi government. Al- Dosari has been accused by Saud al-Qahtani, advisor to the Saudi Royal Court at minister rank, of being guilty of crimes related to \\"visa fraud\\" in his home country. Al-Dosari had spearheaded a protest movement known as \\"September 15 Movement\\" that took place throughout Saudi Arabia on September 15, 2017 which has been described as having a \\"huge following\\". The demonstrations called for by al-Dosari come at a stage where the current crisis with Qatar had allowed opponents to rally unprecedented support with which they have never before been able to assemble, which may be the cause of the nervousness of authorities towards the protests. Up to twenty prominent clergymen such as Salman al-Ouda and Awadh al-Qarni had been arrested due to being perceived as \\"pro-Doha\\" and a large following in social networks which the Saudi government feared would be utilized to support the protests called for by al-Dosari. Numerous leading clerics linked to the Saudi state such as Grand Mufti Abdul- Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh and Saleh Al Maghamsi have criticized al- Dosari's movement and called for Saudi citizens to strongly oppose it. Al Sheikh appeared on an MBC talk show and stated that \\"those advocating for [protests] for the 15th September Movement are advocates of corruption and fitna. There is no good in them nor does good arise from what they are calling for which is promulgated by the enemies of Saudi Arabia... and these are the advocates of Jahiliyyah (ignorance) and perversity.\\" As of 14 September 2017, al-Dosari had around 424,000 followers on Twitter and hundreds of thousands to millions of views on his YouTube videos. On 24 October 2018, in response to the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, al-Dosari and twelve others protested in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy in London, displaying \\"Justice for Jamal\\" banners, chanting calls for finding Khashoggi's body, and claiming that Mohammad bin Salman was responsible for the killing. Al-Dosari said that he was not deterred by the assassination. Harassment and beating According to Arab Digest and Global Policy, al-Dosari was threatened with decapitation by Prince Abdulaziz bin Mashour, a brother of Sarah bint Mashhoor bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the wife of Mohammad bin Salman, and on 10 September 2017 with being killed and eaten by Majed Maliki, who claims to have killed several people. On 31 August 2018, al-Dosari was attacked during the daytime in London in front of Harrods by two men who shouted at him, \\"Who are you to talk about the family of al-Saud?\\". Al-Dosari responded to the assailants that they were not in Riyadh, and that \\"this is London\\". One of the two mean answered, \\"F*** London, their Queen is our slave and their police are our dogs.\\" Al-Dosari believed that the attackers were Saudis carrying out an intimidation campaign because of his human rights activities and political views.

In 2017, Hofmeister won the Best Lager award at the International Wine & Spirits Competition (IWSC), becoming the first lager to be given five stars at the awards.  Production  Since 2016, Hofmeister has been brewed by Schweiger, a German brewery located in Markt Schwaben near the Ebersberger Forest in Bavaria. Hofmeister uses spring water from Schweiger's well, as well as locally grown barley and hops from the Hallertau region. The beer is slow brewed and light golden blonde in colour, with low carbonation. The product is imported from Bavaria for sale in the U.K.  Advertising  The brand was marketed in the 1980s with the slogan \\"Follow the Bear\\" and an advertising campaign featuring a bear, George, with a shiny, yellow jacket and a pork pie hat. The first batch of the adverts in 1983 was the final directorial work of film director Orson Welles.

Background  The attacks came as the Islamic State group faced a series of crushing defeats both in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, including the loss of Mosul after a nine-month battle in early July, followed by a successful Iraqi government offensive against the nearby town of Tal Afar in late August. U.S. officials said the terrorist organization had been severely degraded after losing almost 90 percent of the territory it captured during the 2014 blitz across Iraq, including populated places that held factories for creating car bombs and improvised explosive devices. This meant that members would increasingly rely on a combination of suicide bombers, automatic weapons and other methods as their primary means of targeting civilian and government infrastructure, as evidenced by a series of attacks in Tikrit, as well as a bombing at an ice cream parlor in Baghdad. Analysts and journalists alike warned that despite the recent setbacks, the group remained capable of launching attacks across Iraq, especially at soft targets such as restaurants and entertainment venues.  Attacks  In the first attack, which took place around lunchtime, several gunmen and at least one suicide bomber wearing military uniforms arrived in three cars and entered the Fadak restaurant on Freeway 1 to Baghdad, a popular stop for pilgrims travelling north to Najaf and Karbala. The assailants then began shooting with automatic weapons and throwing grenades, killing or injuring at least 50 people. Shortly afterwards, two suicide bombers, including one driving an explosives-rigged car, blew themselves up at a nearby police checkpoint, causing further casualties. The twin attacks killed 84 people and injured 93 others, many of them seriously. According to provincial governor Yahya al- Nassiri, the majority of casualties were expected to be Iranian and Iraqi Shia pilgrims, who were inside the restaurant at the time of the first attack. The pro-Islamic State Amaq News Agency claimed the group was responsible for the twin attacks. At least one report said the attackers were disguised as members of the Popular Mobilization Forces‚Äîa mainly Shia group that has fought alongside Iraqi forces against IS. The twin attacks represented one of the highest single-day tolls of any similar incident in southern Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003, and were the deadliest since the government recapture of Mosul in July 2017. The Islamic State group had previously targeted Iraqi and Iranian pilgrims during the 2016 Arba'een Pilgrimage, killing more than 120 people in multiple truck bombings in the central town of Hillah.

The invertebrate fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. There are about 2 million species of arthropods found in the world, and still it is counting. So many new species are discover up to this time also. So it is very complicated and difficult to summarize the exact number of species found within a certain region. The following list provide the pseudoscorpions in Sri Lanka. Scorpions Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Arachnida Order: Pseudoscorpiones Pseudoscorpions also known as false scorpion or book scorpion, are easily identified by flat, pear-shaped body and scorpion-like pincers. There are about 3,300 species of scorpions described within 6 superfamilies and 430 genera. The studies on pseudoscorpions of Sri Lanka dated back to 1913 with the contributions of Ellingsen, who described Olpium jacobsoni. In 1930, Chamberlain described two pseudoscorpions, whereas Max Beier described Paratemnus ceylonicus in 1932. However, the first extensive study on pseudoscorpions were carried out by C. Besuchet and I. L√∂bl in 1970. In 1973, Beier described 16 new species, with one new genus. Beier is thus cited as the first person to make a checklist on Sri Lankan pseudoscorpions. With thirty years of war in northern region, the diversity of fauna in northern and eastern regions reduced in greater extent. In 2011, Mark S. Harvey et al described new synonyms and genera for pseudoscorpions. The following list of pseudoscorpions of Sri Lanka compiled according to the 2014 survey by Sudesh Batuwita and Suresh P. Benjamin.

Established during 1966, its aim was to handle the development and commercialization of the Jaguar, an attack and training aircraft.http://www.avionslegendaires.net/avion- militaire/sepecat-jaguar/ Organised as a Soci√©t√© Anonyme, the company was joint venture between British Aircraft Corporation and Breguet. History The Jaguar programme began in the early 1960s, in response to a British requirement (Air Staff Target 362) for an advanced supersonic jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat T.1 and Hawker Hunter T.7, and a French requirement (ECAT or √âcole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique, \\"Tactical Combat Support Trainer\\") for a cheap, subsonic dual-role trainer and light attack aircraft to replace the Fouga Magister, Lockheed T-33 and Dassault Myst√®re IV.\\"Military Dassault aircraft: Jaguar.\\" Dassault Aviation. Retrieved: 15 November 2010.Bowman 2007, pp. 12‚Äì13. A memorandum of understanding was signed in May 1965 for the two countries to develop two aircraft, a trainer based on the ECAT, and the larger AFVG (Anglo-French Variable Geometry).Jackson 1992, p. 56. Cross-channel negotiations led to the formation of SEPECAT (Soci√©t√© Europ√©enne de Production de l'Avion d'√âcole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique ‚Äì the \\"European company for the production of a combat trainer and tactical support aircraft\\"Wagner 2009, p. 122.) in 1966 as a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation to produce the airframe. Though based in part on the Breguet Br.121, using the same basic configuration and an innovative French-designed landing gear, the Jaguar was built incorporating major elements of design from BAC ‚Äì notably the wing and high lift devices.Jackson 1992, pp. 58, 71. Production of components would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; one in the UK and one in France,Bowman 2007, pp. 14‚Äì17. To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source.Flight 16 October 1969, p. 600. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and afterburning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining the illusion of a shared design, the British design departed from the French subsonic Breguet 121 to such a degree that it was effectively a new design. A separate partnership was formed between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour afterburning turbofan engine.Taylor 1980, p. 105.Taylor 1980, p. 708. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which would be used for the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.Bowman 2007. pp. 18‚Äì19. Previous collaborative efforts between Britain and France had been complicated; the BAC/Dassault AFVG programme had ended in cancellation, while controversy surrounded the development of the supersonic airliner Concorde.Wallace 1984, p. 27. Early on, collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well;Jackson 1992, p. 58. however, following Dassault's takeover of Breguet in 1971, the firm encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super √âtendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1, for which it would receive more workshare and profit, over the Jaguar.Jackson 1992, p. 77. Specifically, Dassault claimed that the Super √âtendard was simpler and cheaper than the Jaguar, successfully persuading the French Navy to order it instead of the marinised Jaguar M, leading to the variant's cancellation in 1973.Bowman 2007, p. 26. In addition to the type's adoption by France and the United Kingdom, the Jaguar was successfully exported abroad as well. As early as 1968, India had been approached as a possible customer for the Jaguar, but had declined, partly on the grounds that it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service.Cohen and Dasgupta 2010, p. 77. India had already developed the indigenously Marut fighter-bomber, and was at one point keen to upgrade the type, until such efforts failed. The Indian Air Force (IAF) became the largest single export customer of the Jagaur, placing a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of competitors such as the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process.Barua 2005, p. 274.Air International October 1988, pp. 177‚Äì181. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name Shamsher (\\"Sword of Justice\\").Eden 2004, pp. 400‚Äì401.

Built in 1901, it was the first sugar factory in Serbia. In 1984 it was placed under protection as the cultural monument.  Location  The factory complex is located at 3 and 3-a Radniƒçka street, in the municipality of ƒåukarica. On the west, south and east it is encircled by the Pa≈°troviƒáeva street, which on the east separates it from the Belgrade Hippodrome and the neighborhood of Careva ƒÜuprija. To the north, across the Radniƒçka, is the Sava river's Bay of ƒåukarica and Belgrade's popular recreational zone, Ada Ciganlija. To the northwest it borders another industrial complex, the reservoirs of Jugopetrol.  History  At the present location of the sugar factory, there was a kafana in the second half of the 19th century. It was very popular as it was located at the point where two roads, one from Obrenovac and other from ≈†umadija, meet at the entrance to Belgrade. It was owned by Stojko ƒåukar and after him the kafana was named ‚Äúƒåukareva kafana‚Äù which later gave name to the village of ƒåukarica, which developed into the urban neighborhood and a municipality of Belgrade. King Alexander Obrenoviƒá instigated the Law on promotion of the domestic industry in 1898. Based on the law, the international tendering for the sugar factory was announced and companies from Belgium, United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, Germany and even Japan applied. The grant was given to the German consortium \\"Royal Serbian privileged sugar factory in Belgrade, Hacke, Goldschmidt and Weinschenk\\". The consortium was formed by Alfred Hacke, an engineer from Magdeburg, Julius Goldschmidt, a banker and a consul from Lugshaven and Max Weinschenk, industrialist and the main shareholder of the large sugar refinery in Regensburg. The complex was built from 1899 to 1901, as the first sugar refinery in Serbia. The refinery had a machine room, drying room, quarters for the employees, administrative building and a house for the workers. The complex was later renovated and expanded several times with new objects. Already in 1902 it was temporarily closed due to being unprofitable. It was heavily damaged during the World War I and remained privately owned until 1918 when the Serbian Ministry of Justice began administering it. In 1925 it was reorganized as a separate company again, under the name of \\"State sugar factory in ƒåukarica\\". It was damaged again, during the German bombing of Belgrade in April 1941, while German troops looted the remains during the 1944 retreat. After 1945, new Communist authorities nationalized the factory and renamed it the \\"First Serbian sugar factory Dimitrije Tucoviƒá 1898\\" in 1948, after the socialist Dimitrije Tucoviƒá. During its heyday, the factory employed 500 people in three shifts. In 1969, the factory became a part of PKB, Belgrade Agricultural Combinat. As a part of the wider industrial complex of ƒåukarica, the refinery became one of the centres of trade union activities. It was the focal point of the workers who were members and agitators of the Serbian Social Democratic Party, founded by Tucoviƒá. The factory was especially known for the 1907 strike. The State Council ordered for both the army and the police to suppress the strike. The intervention was brutal and violent, 4 workers were killed and many were wounded. In 1952 a bust of Tucoviƒá was placed in the factory yard. The bust has vanished since then while the damaged pedestal still stands.  Closing  The factory was shut down in 1982 when the production was transferred to the new sugar factory in Padinska Skela. The new complex worked until 1998, processing 6,000 tons of sugar beets daily. It has its own power plant on gas and furnace oil, electrical substation, lime kiln, reservoirs for the furnace oil and molasses, concrete pools, silos, warehouses, administrative building with a restaurant and has its own road and railway access. The premises are vacant since 1983, except for the fermentation section which became operational. It is split into the separate company, \\"Vrenje\\". \\"Vrenje\\" covers an area of , while \\"Dimitrije Tucoviƒá\\" occupies the remaining with of business area. The machines were partially moved to Padinska Skela and partially sold. The bankruptcy proceedings for \\"Dimitrije Tucoviƒá\\" started in 2007. The state decided to sell the premises, but in the package with the factory in Padinska Skela (70 objects on ). From 2008 to 2011, five auctions were held and all failed cause there were no interested buyers. For the April 2011 auction, the value for both factories was estimated to 11.88 billion dinars or ‚Ç¨118.8 million. Economists and estate agents gave several reasons for so many unsuccessful sales. While the old factory is on a very attractive location, Padinska Skela section, distant from the city, is not appealing. As the factory is protected, during any reconstruction the authentic appearance has to be preserved and nothing can be done on the complex without the permits from the institutes for protection. Commercial and residential objects are not allowed by the city urban plan, so the possibilities for adaptation include cultural venues: museum, libraries, ateliers, theaters, etc. Also, they concluded that the price is highly overestimated and the state, and not the factory, is still officially owner of some of the land within the complex. Several leaseholders occupy some of the objects. Best known is the alternative theatre house \\"KPGT\\" which held the first show, as part of the BITEF festival in 1994 and in 1995 moved into one of the building.  Future  In 2017 city announced the bidding for an architectural competition concerning the wider Careva ƒÜuprija area (hippodrome, Sugar Refinery and the \\"Jugopetrol\\" complex), 55 hectares (140 acres) in total. In September 2017 the winning project was announced, a work of Marija Krsmanoviƒá Stringeta, Anƒëelka Badnjar and Milena Kordiƒá. The present \\"Jugopetrol\\" depots will be demolished and the hotel and the sports center will be built instead. The total area of the complex will be and it will not be higher than , or 4 floors. Two separate buildings (hotel and the sports center) will be shaped like the curved waves. From the complex, a new system of pathways will allow the entrance into the hippodrome from the side which is not accessible to the visitors today, while in front the buildings the square will be constructed. From the square, paths through the wooded area will connect it to the old factory. Industrial halls will be renovated. As for the protected objects, they will remain as they are, since they are not owned by the city. Within the factory complex, on the area of , some of the objects will be adapted into the artistic colonies, research centers, bookstores, souvenir shops, etc., though all of them will have to preserve the authentic look of the objects. The monuments to Dimitrije Tucoviƒá and the strikers who were killed in World War II will be restored. A footbridge over the Radniƒçka Street will be built, to directly connect the refinery complex to Ada Ciganlija. In October 2018 city officially announced its intention of purchasing the sugar refinery complex, thus becoming its legal proprietor.  Architecture  The buildings are typical examples of the late 19th century industrial architecture in northern and central Europe. Concerning architectural merits, only the central building, the machine room, stands out. It was made of brick and has a characteristic Lombard band (bogen-friz) under the roof. The reconstructions done during the Interbellum and after the World War II, apart from adding new machines also expanded some of the buildings. These extensions changed some of the original architectural features of the complex.  Protection  In the 1980s it was included into the Topƒçider Spatial Cultural-Historical Unit of Exceptional Importance, as an important work of industrial architecture. The complex itself was declared a cultural monument in 1984 (Slu≈æbeni list grada Beograda, No. 23/84). The protected area covers and includes 7 objects.

He introduced Antoine Lavoisier's theories to Italy, and built a phosphorus-based eudiometer sufficiently sensitive to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen. He identified the correct composition of the mineral Gioberite, a form of magnesite (MgCO3) found in the Piedmont area. He was made a knight (Cavaliere) for his work on the chemistry of indigo dyes. Early life Giovanni Antonio Giobert was born on October 27, 1761 in Mongardino near Asti, to Spirito and Anna Gugalin. He was educated by Abbot G. B. Lovizzolo, studying the physical sciences and chemistry, and was apprenticed in pharmacies in Asti and Turin. Science In his early twenties, Giobert focused his studies on the application of chemistry in agriculture and industry. He became a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Turin in 1789, at age 28. He served as president of the academy, and contributed to a history of the academy. He edited and contributed to a Journal of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, by a Philosophical Society at Turn, writing about marl and other fossil substances. In 1800 he became Professor of Agriculture and as of 1802 professor of chemistry and mineralogy at the University of Turin. He was involved in the Reale Societ√† Agraria di Torino, the Societ√† Italiana della Scienza in Verona (later in Modena) and other scientific academies. Beginning in 1808 he was a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Giobert was part of a Turin-based Comitato Galvanico that supported the theories of Luigi Galvani against those of Alessandro Volta. Giobert carried out research into the conduction of electricity and the forming of precipitates along a wire in a galvanic apparatus. Giobert was one of the first to spread Antoine Lavoisier's theories in Italy. He published experimental work in the debate over whether water was a simple element or chemical composition of hydrogen and oxygen. In 1792, his work on the refutation of phlogiston theory won a prize competition on the subject, put forward by the Academy of Letters and Sciences of Mantua in 1790 and 1791. His \\"Examen chimique de la doctrine du phlogistique et de la doctrine des pneumatistes par rapport √† la nature de l 'eau\\", presented to the Acad√©mie royale des Sciences of Turin on March 18, 1792, is considered the most original defense of Lavoisier;s theory of water composition to appear in Italy. Giobert contributed significantly to eudiometry, the study of gas composition, by further developing Lavoisier's eudiometer. Giobert built a phosphorus-based instrument sufficiently sensitive to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen. He used it to compare the air quality of Turin with higher altitude Vinadio. A number of other researchers developed variants on his eudiometer, including Spallanzani, Humphry Davy, John Dalton, and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. Nicolas-Th√©odore de Saussure commended it for its accuracy, describing its use in his studies of the roles of water and gases in the nutrition of plants as follows: Among his many experiments Giobert examined a Piedmontese mineral that he correctly identified as a specific form of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). The Piedmontese variety of magnesite is sometimes referred to as Gioberite, distinguishing it from other forms. It was named after Giobert by Fran√ßois Sulpice Beudant. Identifying its composition was an important contribution to the industry of pottery-making. Giobert also investigated the influence of magnesia on plant growth and found that the presence of earths of silica, lime, alumina and magnesia in the soil was not sufficient for plant growth. This work was important to Saussure and others studying plant growth. In 1790, the University of Turin established the Deputazione per la Tinture, an ambitious project whose goals included the study of dye plants, the review of dyeing processes, cataloguing of dyestuffs and establishing a library, improving artisan skills, working with foreign dyers and chemists, and using new chemicals and instruments to improve the state of the art in Piedmont. An imperial decree in 1810 encouraged the improvement of scientific and industrial techniques for using woad. Giobert was active as a chemical advisor and made important contributions to the dyeing industry, studying the chemistry of natural dyes including woad, indigo, and turkey red. For example, Giobert suggested that uneven bleaching of cotton with alkaline lye was a cause of variable color-fastness when the cloth was dyed. He helped to identify differences between animal- and plant- based dyes, and developed techniques for \\"animalizing\\" fibres with nitrogen gas to improve the solidity of the dye. Such techniques became widespread throughout the European dyeing industry. In 1811 Giobert worked with Raymond Latour on the development of blue dyes which became widely used. In 1813, Giobert was appointed director of the √âcole imp√©riale pour la fabrication de l'indigo in Turin, which was established to study industrial processing of indigo. Giobert identified a colorless form of indigo (sometimes called indigogen or 'white' indigo) in plants, convertible to indigo-blue through oxidation. For his work on the indigo color dyeing method, Giobert was made a knight (Cavaliere). Giobert also developed the Gioberti tincture, which involved application of hydrochloric acid and potassium ferrocyanide. The Gioberti tincture was used in the 19th century and early 20th century to restore illegible writings or faded pictures, before less harsh chemical reagents were found. Gioberti tincture was used to show the original inscriptions of palimpsests by conservators at the Vatican. Politics The period in which Giobert was active was one of considerable political upheaval. The University of Turin was closed in both 1797 and 1799 due to political events. Giobert was a francophile and a strong republican supporter of Napoleon. In 1798 he was appointed to the provisional government of Piedmont (Il Governo Provvisorio della Nazione Piemontese), only to be imprisoned in 1799 when the Austrians briefly took power. Following his release, he became a professor at the University of Turin. In 1814, after the restoration of King Victor Emmanuel I, Giobert was one of nine professors removed from their teaching positions in Turin due to their political involvement. Memorials Giobert died on September 14, 1834 in Millefiori near Turin. He is remembered by the town of Asti, which named a street in his honor in 1868, and established the Istituto Giobert di Asti in 1882. He was also honored by the town of Mongardino which named the Scuola Elementare Giobert di Mongardino in his honor. Scholars continue to study his life and work. A bust of Giobert was unveiled at the ‚ÄúGiobert: da Mongardino alla nuova chimica‚Äù conference in Mongardino on October 20, 2013.

The invertebrate fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. There are about 2 million species of arthropods found in the world, and still it is counting. So many new species are discover up to this time also. So it is very complicated and difficult to summarize the exact number of species found within a certain region. The following list provide the whip spiders, whip scorpions and daddy longlegs in Sri Lanka. Whip spiders Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Arachnida Order: Amblypygi Whip spiders, also known as tailless whip scorpions, are harmless arachnids that are clearly identified by the absence of tail, with broad and highly flattened body. Amblypygids have raptorial pedipalps, equipped with long spines. First pair of legs are modified as antennae-like feelers giving whip-like appearance. They walk in crab-like, sideways movements. All amblypygi are harmless to humans. There are about 155 species of whip spiders described within 5 families and 17 genera. In Sri Lanka, only three species can be found, belong to single genus.  Family: Phrynichidae  * Phrynichus ceylonicus (C. L. Koch, 1843) * Phrynichus pusillus (Pocock, 1894) **Phrynichus pusillus gracillibrachiatus * Phrynichus reniformis (Linnaeus, 1758) Whip scorpions Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Arachnida Order: Thelyphonida Whip scorpions, also known as vinegaroons, are clearly identified by the presence of a whip-like tail. First pair of legs are modified as antennae. They have very large scorpion-like pedipalps, with an additional large spine on each palpal tibia. When threatened, they emit vinegar-like smell offensive liquid from glands near the rear of their abdomen. There are about 100 species of whip scorpions described within 15 genera, included to a single family. In Sri Lanka, only two species can be found, belong to two genera.  Family: Thelyphonidae  * Labochirus proboscideus (Butler, 1872) * Thelyphonus sepiaris (Butler, 1873) Short- tailed whipscorpions Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Arachnida Order: Schizomida Short-tailed whipscorpions, also known as Schizomids are relatively small, soft-bodied arachnids, with two-segmented bodies. Prosoma divided into three segments - protopeltidium, mesopeltidia and metapeltidia. Opisthosoma is divided into 12 recognizable segments. Last opisthosoma segment bears a short whip-like tail. The order consists two extant families, where Sri Lanka comprised with two species in a single family.  Family: Hubbardiidae  * Schizomus crassicaudatus (O. P.-cambridge, 1872) * Schizomus peradeniyensis (Gravely, 1911) Camel spiders Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Arachnida Order: Solifugae Camel spiders, also known as wind scorpions or sun spiders are not true relatives of true scorpions or spiders however. Body divides into two regions as in other arachnids. They have conspicuously large two chelicerae. They do not have a tail. More than 1000 species of crab spiders described under 153 genera and 12 families. In Sri Lanka only one species can be found.  Family: Rhagodidae  * Rhagodes phipsoni (Pocock, 1895) Daddy longlegs Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Arachnida Order: Opiliones Daddy longlegs, also known as harvestmen are not true relatives of spiders however. Body divides into two regions as in other arachnids. With name implies, they are characterized by exceptionally long legs relative to their body size. They show broad connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen, which clearly differentiate them from spiders. More than 6,500 species of daddy longlegs described under 5 suborders. In Sri Lanka 21 species can be found under five families.

The musical ran from September 23 to October 9  Film Appearance  In August 2009, We Have Always Lived in the Castle was adapted for the screen by Further Films After several years of pre-production and casting, Taissa Farmiga was cast in the role of Merricat  Characterization  On the opening page of We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Merricat describes herself as such: > My Name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live > with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I > could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my > hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I > dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and > Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the deathcup mushroom... > Everyone else in my family is dead. Marisa Silver sees Merricat's opening monologue as \\"brazen, creepy, obviously unreliable and utterly disarming.\\" Merricat describes herself as eighteen during the events of the novel but her actions represent a child of much younger age, \\"smashing things when she's upset and getting lost in her reveries of living on the moon.\\" Silver continues to say that Merricat's opening words are reflective of the childlike way in which she acts and how she is treated by her surviving family members [9]. Readers can see early signs of Merricat's affinity for violence when she speaks of the villagers: > Without looking, I could see the grinning and the gesturing: I wished they > were all dead and I was walking on their bodies. This hatred for the villagers is apparent in Merricat's attitude throughout the novel, as the family's \\"ostracism by the community\\" has taken a toll on the Blackwood family. In order to deal with her exile, Merricat has a number of eccentricities, namely her obsessive behaviors. Merricat has strange habits of \\"burying coins, nailing books to trees, and even choosing specific magical words that she will not say.\\" As a result of social rejection, Joyce Jackson writes that Merricat, along with her family, have become representative of Jackson's agoraphobia. Merricat's deranged and agoraphobic behaviors can be seen in her handling of Cousin Charles. Charles appearance brings out a longing for change in sister Constance but Merricat, so frightened by the \\"change and disorder\\" this would bring chooses to set the house on fire. Silver notes that rather than accept a new order in her (Merricat's) life, she, quite literally, chooses to let the world burn down around her. Merricat's questionable decision-making lends an argument for the unreliable narrator. Angela Slatter quotes The Usual Suspects to describe Merricat: \\"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\\" Merricat allures readers by making \\"us love this strange, broken girl\\" but, upon revealing her true nature with the climax of the novel, she \\"breaks our hearts\\" [10]. She is in fact \\"jealous, dangerously so; when there seems the prospect of a kind of happiness... Merricat does her destructive best to derail it\\" [10].  Critical reception  Barbara Hodge Hall, of the Anniston Star, had this to say of Merricat upon We Have Always Lived in the Castle's initial release in 1962: \\"Merricat is 18, but a strange 18, still child-like in habits but a thousand years old in intuition.\\" Lynette Carpenter, featured in the journal Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, sees Merricat in a more feminist point of view. Carpenter's article, \\"The Establishment and Preservation of Female Power in Shirley Jackson's 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle,'\\" claims that Merricat has drawn a blow against \\"masculine authority\\" as power has shifted from \\"the Blackwood men to the Blackwood women.\\" Thus Merricat, displaying a \\"forceful establishment of power\\" over her own life, \\"threatens a society in which men hold primary power\\" and this display of power will \\"inevitably [lead] to confrontation.\\" Judith Colombo of The Weekly Gleaner sees Merricat as \\"the perfect tragic hero.\\" Colombo sees her as desperate to care for her family, but when her polite and magical means fail her, she turns to more \\"desperate methods.\\" Joyce Carol Oates, who has written of Merricat as a character on many occasions,https://celestialtimepiece.com/2009/09/18/joyce-carol-oates-on- shirley-jackson/https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/508-editor-joyce-carol- oates-on-the-enduring-spell-of-shirley-jackson has said 'Of all the precocious children and adolescents of mid-twentieth-century American fiction‚Äîa dazzling lot that includes the tomboys Frankie of Carson McCullers's The Member of the Wedding (1946) and Scout Finch of Harper Lee‚Äôs To Kill a Mockingbird (1960), the murderous eight-year-old Rhoda Penmark of William March‚Äôs The Bad Seed (1954), and the slightly older, disaffected Holden Caulfield of J.D.

According to Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Ali Larijani, the Holy Shrine Defenders guarantee the \\"security, awareness and dignity of the Iranian people\\" by fighting against ISIS.

Hassan Nasrallah answered that such as these actions has negative consequences. Also he said about forces who defend Zaynab bint Ali ‚Äôs shrine. On August 2012, Syrian opposition forces attacked Al-Mashhad area of Aleppo in Syria. After this event, some groups decided to defend the shrine of Sakinah, Daughter of Husayn ibn Ali. While Abolfazl al-Abbas Brigade in Iraq was established on January 2013 and they went to Syria for defending Zaynab bint Ali ‚Äôs shrine, using the term of Holy Shrine Defenders was widely spread in the Iranian media on April 2013.

It extends across Cascadia Abyssal Plain, through the Blanco Fracture Zone, and into Tufts Abyssal Plain. Notably, Cascadia Channel has tributaries, akin to river tributaries. Cascadia Channel has two contributing tributaries‚ÄîJuan de Fuca Channel from the north, and the outflow of Quinault and Willapa Channels in the south. The channel is believed to be over long. Formation Headed north-south, Cascadia Channel initially formed on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, which was actively spreading. In the late Cenozoic, the volcanic basement was covered by transparent pelagic and hemipelagic sediment, which horizontally deposited turbidites covered. During late Pleistocene glaciation and the lowering of sea level, much sand and gravel from the shore deposited on either the upper slope or the outer shelf, which initiated turbidity currents, converting the lower and middle portions of the channel into erosional features. This led to the initiation of downcutting. At this time, apparently the channel built up by turbidity current that proceeded south, along the western part of the Cascadia abyssal plain, also from the west of the Astoria Fan. During the Holocene, turbidity current from the Columbia River sediment continued to flow, both down the Cascade channel and the Blanco Fracture Zone. Marine Biology In the channel, the benthic animal population is four times as abundant compared to the surrounding Juan de Fuca Plate. In Cascadia Channel, burrowing organisms have left many well-preserved burrows of distinct sizes and shapes in turbidity current deposits. Turbidite Flows An earthquake can trigger a turbidite flow, and these are likely to record a succession of submarine mass movements. At the head of a submarine canyon there may be a sediment flow, which may begin as a slide or slump, continue as a debris flow, and change into a turbidity current as fluid content increases down slope. Geologic evidence for the occurrence of earthquakes on the Cascadia Subduction Zone is off Oregon and Washington, and includes sedimentary deposits that have been observed in cores from deep-sea channels and abyssal fans. Earthquakes can set off submarine mass movements that can initiate turbidity currents. In 1990, John Adams of the Geological Survey of Canada suggested that these turbidity currents originated during great subduction zone earthquakes. There is a consistent number of turbidites in core samples from both side and main channels, indicating that each turbidity current was likely caused at the same time, by the same event which may be the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Of the turbidites, large storms are not the likely source. Ash from the eruption of Mount Mazama, which gave modern-day Oregon its Crater Lake, reached Cascadia Channel via the continental shelf and submarine canyons.

On 15 November 1908, Belgium assumed sovereignty over the territories comprising the Congo Free State, officially making the Belgian Congo a colony of Belgium. Prelude Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium attempted to persuade the government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely uncharted Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence resulted in Leopold's creating a colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries at the Berlin Conference, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885.Pakenham, Thomas (1992). The Scramble for Africa: the White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912 (13th ed.). London: Abacus. pp. 253‚Äì5. . By the turn of the century, however, the violence used by Free State officials and international mercenaries against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did by ratifying the Colonial Charter on the Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State, thus creating the Belgian Congo in 1908.Pakenham, Thomas (1992). The Scramble for Africa: the White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912 (13th ed.). London: Abacus. pp. 588‚Äì9. . First draft At the beginning of the 20th century, the Belgian press and the public opinion were becoming increasingly wary of the policies of Leopold's African state. Parliamentarians protested against the inhumane practices in the Congo Free State and Congo became a divisive issue in Belgian domestic politics.Vanthemsche, G. (2012). Belgium and the Congo, 1885-1980. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 41. . The Belgian government urged the ageing and stubborn king to agree to the transfer of the Congo Free State to Belgium. The Belgian parliament started on an initial legislation for the future Belgian colony, a long and difficult process. A first draft of the Colonial Charter had already been written in 1901, but with an overtone of royal absolutism, the initial draft included provisions for Leopold II to hold on to a private Crown Domain. His goal was to exclude vast regions of the Congo from the government's control, in order to maintain his personal fortune. Only by the end of 1906 King Leopold II accepted the annexation, after foreign powers (including the British Empire and the United States) threatened to organize an international convention on the Congo.Senelle, R., and E. Cl√©ment (2009), L√©opold II et la Charte Coloniale, Brussels: Editions Mols. Ratification By 1906 this first draft had become unacceptable and the Belgian parliament established a special commission responsible for preparing a new bill concerning the governance of the Belgian Congo. This commission eventually excluded all the provisions relating to royal domination. At the time of the vote in 1908, there was deep political division on the annexation of the Congo Free State.Vanthemsche, G. (2012). Belgium and the Congo, 1885-1980. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 41. . Political rallies and the dispersion of pamphlets favouring or opposing the annexation increased. A majority of the socialists and the radicals firmly opposed this annexation and reaped electoral benefits from their anti-colonialist campaign. However, some socialists believed that the country should annex the Congo and play a humanitarian role with regard to the Congolese population. Eventually, two Catholic MP's and half of the Liberal MP's joined the socialists in rejecting the Colonial Charter (forty-eight votes against) and nearly all the Catholics and the other half of the Liberal MP's approved the charter (ninety votes for and seven abstentions).Polasky J. (1995). The democratic socialism of Emile Vandevelde: Between Reform and Revolution. Berg, Oxford/Washington D.C., Chapter 3.

It was a Catholic religious teaching institute for women, later renamed Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Father Joaquim Masmitj√† and in some other sources Joaquin MasmitjaSisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary: Our founder was the fourth child of Francisco and Maria Gracia. He entered the minor seminary for the Diocese of Gerona and then went on to get degrees in canon and civil law. Masmitj√°, who was greatly devoted to the Blessed Virgin under the titles of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sorrowful Mother, was ordained a priest on February 22, 1834. Assigned to his hometown parish, Fr. Masmitj√° became increasingly concerned over the poor education of young girls. He sought to rebuild society through their education in prayer and Christian doctrine. On July 1, 1848, Masmitj√° founded the Institute of the Daughters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In 1869, Fr. Masmitja's friend Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi of Monterey, California, was visiting Spain, and asked for some of the sisters to come to California. Two years later, with Father Masmitja's approval, Mother Raimunda led nine others to the new California mission. The Sisters established two houses, one in Gilroy and the other in San Juan. Very soon the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart were teaching in several schools in different parts of California. Their lifestyle attracted young women to follow the charisma of Fr. Masmitja, and the Sisters inaugurated a third house in San Luis Obispo (1876), a fourth house in San Bernardino (1880), and finally the last house during the lifetime of Fr. Masmitja was established in Los Angeles (1886). Father Joaquin Masmitja died at the age of 78, on August 26th, 1886.

She founded the Arthur's Home For Destitute Boys and the LaRue Holmes Nature Lovers' League, both in memory of her sons, who died young. Early life Morris-Jumel Mansion Georgiana Klingle was born in November 4, 1841, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of George Franklin Klingle (1796-1840), M.D. and Mary Hunt Morris (1812-1897). Mary Hunt Morris was the daughter of William H. Morris and Catherine Tiers of New York City. She descended from Lewis Morris, of Morrisania, Pennsylvania, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Once widow, Mary Hunt Morris Klingle married John Haas, of Philadelphia, who raised Georgiana Klingle as his daughter. Georgiana Klingle father's ancestry is found in Upper Saxony.

Career Georgiana Klingle Holmes, Portrait of Martha Washington after Gilbert Stuart, 1887 From early childhood Georgiana Klingle Holmes contributed to periodicals of the different cities. Her taste ran in a groove not often entered by young authors, children's stories with a moral to leave an impression. She was an artist of merit, but writing was the passion of her life. Two portraits, Portrait of Martha Washington after Gilbert Stuart (1887) and Portrait of Mrs. Laura Klingle (n√©e Tiernan) (circa 1875) were sold to auction in 2012-2013. Georgiana Klingle Holmes, Portrait of Mrs. Laura Klingle, circa 1875 She wrote poetry using the pen-name \\"George Klingle\\", which touched many hearts. Her collection of poems entitled \\"Make Thy Way Mine\\" (New York, 1876) was made after repeated letters from interested strangers in different parts of the country. That collection was followed by \\"In the Name of the King\\" (New York, 1888). Being interested in philanthropic work, she founded Arthur's Home For Destitute Boys, in Summit, New Jersey, (later The Blind Babies Home) in memory of her son, who died at the age of nine years after being bitten by a rabid dog. It closed in 1927. At the death of her second son, LaRue, she founded the LaRue Holmes Nature Lovers' League, for which she was active in various schools, travelling by horse and buggy between 1915 and 1925 to give talks on nature.

Reception  The movie received very good reviews from the families of the soldiers who participated in the war who thanked J P Dutta, the film producer for presenting the life story of the unsung army officers. The movie also received very good reviews from army circles and officials from the Defence Ministry of India for revealing the true incidents from the lesser known battle of 1967 war at the Sikkim border. Audience and critics found the film's execution largely ineffective for a war film with caricature characters and extremely long runtime. Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India gave it 3/5 stars calling it a long-drawn war-drama that picks up only during the final moments.

The mosque is located on the opposite side of the city center of Jambi which is divided by the Batanghari river, and specifically in the area of Olak Kemang, Teluk Teluk District.  History  The mosque was founded in 1880 by an Arab Indonesian named Sayyid Idrus bin Hasan Al-Jufri. Sayyid Idrus was the sultan of the area in the last decade of the nineteenth century with the title of Prince Wiro Kusumo. The mosque was founded by Sayyid Idrus to fulfill the need of worship place for people across the city of Jambi.  Characteristics  The building in the mosque is filled with ornaments of various Islamic calligraphies. The original pulpit stands majestically on the right side of the mihrab. The striking feature of this mosque is the number of paired windows which surround the mosque. Only the mihrab wall is windowless.  Restoration  As the size of Muslim society in Jambi evolved, the mosque became inadequate to accommodate the congregation which continues booming, especially on Friday prayer. Thus public figures held a deliberation and agreed to renew the mosque. The restoration of the mosque was agreed to be funded by waqf (almsgiving). Being under Dutch colonial rule, the community leaders were required to ask for permission to the Dutch. Being aware of the historical value of the sultan's mosque, the 1937 colonial Dutchman took over the reconstruction of the mosque. The funds went down from the colonial state and development was adjoined entirely within Dutch control. With the unused fund of the community, they eventually made a fence around the mosque.Majalah Hidayah edisi 58, Mei 2006 halaman 126-129 References Buildings and structures in Jambi Mosques completed in 1880 Mosques in Indonesia Tourist attractions in Jambi ","title":"Ikhsaniyyah Mosque"},{"id":"55237609","text":"The 1978 United States Senate special election in Minnesota was held on November 7, 1978. Democratic candidate Bob Short was defeated by Republican candidate David Durenberger.  Race Description  In 1978, all three key statewide races in Minnesota were up for election‚Äîthe Governorship, and both Senate Seats (the other Senate seat belonged to Wendell Anderson, who, as Governor of Minnesota, appointed himself to fill the seat vacated by Walter Mondale, when Mondale ascended to the Vice Presidency in 1976). But, there was a particular oddity to the three races‚Äîall three had incumbents who were never elected to the office in the first place. This became a well played issue by the Republicans‚Äîa billboard put up across the state read, \\"The DFL is going to face something scary -- an election\\". When Hubert H. Humphrey died in office in January 1978, sitting Governor Rudy Perpich appointed Humphrey's widow, Muriel to sit until a special election could be held later that year. However, Muriel Humphrey opted not to seek election to the seat in her own right, and the DFL nominated former Texas Rangers owner Bob Short to run in the subsequent special election. Short was rather conservative by DFL standards of the time, and his positions on hot button issues such as abortion, motorboat usage in the Boundary Waters Canoe area, and government spending gave more liberal DFLers pause. The Independent-Republicans, for their part, nominated the liberal Republican David Durenberger, creating an unusual race in which the Independent-Republican candidate ran to the left of the DFL canddiate. In addition to the general sense of dissatisfaction voters felt for the DFL, the party also had to contend with a large number of liberal DFLers crossing party lines to vote for Durenberger. As a result, Durenberger won in a 26.9-percent landslide as the governorship and both U.S. Senate seats switched into Republican hands.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The tower of the church survives from the 13th century building, but the nave was rebuilt and the north aisle added around 1490. A musicians gallery was added in 1770. Victorian restoration was undertaken in the 19th century when the roof was replaced and the south transept added to the building. In 2010 permission was granted for the construction of a disabled toilet at the church. The parish is part of the benefice of Dulverton with Brushford, Brompton Regis, Upton and Withiel Florey within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The stone building has a slate roof. It consists of a four- bay, chancel, south transept, and a four-bay north aisle. The two-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. A church may have stood on the site from the 11th century, which was the property of Barlynch Priory. Inside the church the pulpit dates from 1625, while the font is 19th century. An early barrel organ was replaced in 1897 with a reed organ, by Thomas Christopher Lewis, which still remains in the church but has been moved from its original position.

Early life Hansen was born on 1695 in Albany, New York. He was the eldest son of seven children born to Albany mayor Hendrick Hansen (1665‚Äì1724) and Debora Van Dam (c. 1670‚Äì1742), His siblings were Debora Hansen (1693‚Äì1745), who married Jacobus Beekman (1685‚Äì1739), Maria Hansen (1697‚Äìc. 1697), who married David A. Schuyler (1692‚Äìc. 1697), Nicholas Hansen (b. 1698), who married Engeltie Wemp, and Ryckert \\"Richard\\" Hansen (1703‚Äì1766), who married Sara Thong (d. 1733) and after her death, he married Catharina Ten Broeck (1717‚Äìc. 1780s). His paternal grandparents were Eva Gillis de Meyer and Hans Hendrickse, a Beverwyck trader, and Eva Gillis de Meyer Hansen. His mother was the only daughter of Claes Ripse Van Dam (d. 1709), an carpenter and Justice of the Peace for Albany County and Maria (n√©e Bords) Van Dam. Career According to his fathers 1723 will, and upon his father's death in 1724, he inherited, by right of primogeniture, his father's \\"lot of ground in Albany, on the north side thereof.\\" He also received, equally divided with his brother Nicholas, his father's farm and 2,000 acres of land that was situated \\"on the north side of the Maqueses river\\" near Ticonderoga. The land was granted to him by Patent from Brig. Gen. Robert Hunter who served Governor of the Province of New York. One was to get the house, barn, barracks, and other buildings along with the responsibility to assist and pay upkeep towards the other half. His father's mill was to be held in partnership between the sons. In 1721, he served as a Constable of Albany. In 1731, surprising many, he was appointed the Mayor of Albany, New York by John Montgomerie, succeeding Johannes de Peyster III. He served in that role for a year until De Peyster was again appointed mayor. He was again appointed mayor in 1754 by James De Lancey, succeeding Robert Sanders. He was reappointed and died in office in 1756. Again following after his father, he served as a Commissioners of Indian Affairs for a total of 2 years, having been appointed in 1754.

It was owned by Jack Michel and affiliated with Larkin Community Hospital. It was acquired by Hollywood Property Investments in 2015. The facility offered services such as advanced nursing care, 24 hour nursing care, tube feeding and nutritional management. The facility was rated below average on inspections, staffing and quality of care, according to a federal scorecard.  Hurricane Irma  After the air conditioning system failed due to a power outage during Hurricane Irma in 2017, residents suffered from sweltering heat inside the facility. The facility had previously been cited for failing to maintain the emergency generator. Although portable A/C units were in use, engineer expert William Crawford later testified in a deposition in February 2018 that the A/C units were insufficient and actually made conditions worse. Crawford stated that heat would have been vented upwards, causing temperatures on the second floor to have possibly reached between , while the remainder of the facility was well above , the maximum temperature allowed by state law. Additionally, for unknown reasons, the nursing home was not listed on FPL's priority restoration list. After multiple 9-1-1 calls from the nursing home on September 13, paramedics and staff from a nearby hospital arrived at the scene and found many patients suffering from heat stroke or a fever, with some having a body temperature as high as . A total of 145 patients were transported to nearby Memorial Regional Hospital due to respiratory distress and heat-related issues, though at least 8 died at the nursing home. with a total of 12 patients ultimately perishing. Initially, 14 fatalities were linked to the loss of air conditioning at the nursing home, though two of those deaths were later considered unrelated to the incident. A moratorium on admissions was placed by the Agency for Health Care Administration. It was removed from Medicaid. The Hollywood Police Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement both opened a criminal investigation into the deaths at the center, which city officials have said continued to operate with little or no air conditioning after power was cut off by Irma. In a press release the company stated, \\"The Center and its medical and administrative staff diligently prepared for the impact of Hurricane Irma\\". A lawyer hired by the family of one victim stated that the facility had more than a week to prepare and accused the nursing home of putting profits ahead of safety. In October, Governor Scott implemented emergency rules requiring assisted living facilities and nursing homes to have generators that are capable of operating air conditioners for up to four days in the event of a power outage. On November 22, the 12 deaths at the nursing home were ruled to be homicides by heat exposure. Court hearings for the potential permanent revocation of the nursing home's license began on January 29, 2018. The deaths at the Hollywood Hills nursing home prompted an immediate response from Florida lawmakers. Governor Scott signed an executive order mandating nursing facilities to have plans in place to supply emergency power for four days in the event of a power outage. Calling the incident \\"a tragedy of gargantuan proportion\\", Representative Frederica Wilson proposed all nursing and assisted-living facilities have backup generators and the ability to run air conditioning with generator power. By September 19, Senator Lauren Book filed a bill that would require such facilities to be able to use generator power for five days. About twelve bills related to nursing homes and generators were filed in the 2018 Florida Legislative session.  Closure  An emergency order on Wednesday, September 20, 2017 by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) suspended the home's license to operate, after the deaths in the aftermath of Irma. On the same day, the facility closed permanently, laying off 245 people.

Design & history The origins of the houfnice vz. 28 began in 1928 at the ≈†koda Works in Pilsen. The design attempted to combine the howitzer and mountain gun roles into one weapon. The houfnice vz. 28 combined a two-wheeled box trail carriage, horizontal sliding-wedge breech, Hydro- pneumatic recoil system and high angle elevation. For the mountain gun role it could be broken down into three pieces for transport, a feature also shared by the contemporary 8 cm kanon vz. 28 and the later 8 cm kanon vz. 30 and 10 cm houfnice vz. 30 guns. The Czech Army declined to adopt the houfnice vz. 28, but ordered its successor the houfnice vz. 30 in larger numbers.

His work embodies the \\"expressive and psychological aspects of the human figure; an art focused on the life cycle.\\" He taught art for 27 years at various institutions including Swain School of Design, Wellesley College, Boston University, the National Academy, and the Art Students League of New York. Currently Professor Emeritus at the University of New Hampshire, Abeles works full-time in his NYC and upstate NY studios. He is the recipient of numerous grants and awards for printmaking, drawing, painting, and sculpture, including Pastel Society of America Hall of Fame honoree in 2004 and most recently the Artists' Fellowship 2017 Benjamin West Clinedinst Medal. His work can be found in many public institutions including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Abeles was one of three artists featured in Manfred Kirchheimer's 2012 feature-length independent film Art Is... The Permanent Revolution, on the history of the art of protest in prints.  Early life and education Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Abeles grew up in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The only child of Samuel and Henrietta Abeles, he was named after his grandfather, a renowned Orthodox rabbi who immigrated to the United States from Hungary in 1901. His father, a Hungarian Jew, was a decorated World War I veteran who used his pension to open up a retail business in Sheeps Head Bay. His mother was of Polish-Jewish descent and worked as a librarian before her marriage. After his parents divorced early on in his life, he moved to Myrtle Beach with his mother where she started a new life by opening up a rooming house called Paul's Guest House on US Highway 17. Spending a great deal of time alone in the rooming house, Sigmund grew a fascination for how many types of people occupy the same domain which had a huge impact and direction on his artwork took. Sigmund Abeles received no formal art training in the public schools at Myrtle Beach. Searching for inspiration, Abeles found Brookgreen Gardens, an outdoor sculpture park, which provided him with a multitude of beautiful bronze and marble figures to sketch; years later, as an established artist, he had his life-sized bronze sculpture, \\" Kaethe, age 9\\" (modeled in 1968 and later cast in Bronze in 2006), placed in Brookgreen's permanent collection. Abeles was invited later to hold a major solo exhibition there in 2015 called \\"Carolina Roots\\".Shortly after graduating, Abeles was drafted into the army in 1957. He was posted to Heidelberg, Germany where he worked as a technical illustrator in a cartography workshop at the US Headquarters Army where he made charts and maps for top secret nuclear war plans. There he rented a house off base in nearby Neckargem√ºnd that belonged to a sculptor. It was here he developed a renewed interest in creating sculptures. After serving two years in the army, he was discharged in Europe and spent the next year touring Italy, Greece and Israel with his then first wife, Gina Godwin. They raised two children, David Paul and Shoshanna Lynn upon coming back to the US. During his high school years, Sigmund was mentored by Truman Moore Sr., a wood sculptor, who pointed him towards the Boston artist Gerard Francis Tempest whom he later apprenticed with.Abeles attended the University of South Carolina, initially for pre- medical studies to appease his mother but he later switched to art studies. There he met Jasper Johns, an upper classman and became long term acquaintances. http://www.needlewatcher.com/conversation-with-artist-sigmund- abeles/ They shared the same art professors, Edmund Yaghijian and Catharine Rembert. In 1952, Abeles attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn for only one semester because his mother would only allow him to study commercial art. In the summer of 1954, determined to pursue his love for fine arts and figurative study, he attended the Art Students League of New York where he was taught by Reginald Marsh, Morris Kantor and Harry Sternberg.Abeles, Sigmund; McLean, Genetta; Drake, Marian E; Bates College (Lewiston, Me.); Museum of Art (1999). Sigmund Abeles: the artist and his prints, 1954‚Äì1999. Lewiston, Me.: Bates College Museum of Art. In 1955, he received a scholarship to the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. He worked under Edwin Dickinson and Isabel Bishop. There he also made lifelong friendships with fellow students Sidney Hurwitz, Philip Grausman, Jerome Witkin and Ashley Bryan. In 1957, he received another scholarship to study at Columbia University where he received his MFA in Painting in just one year. Shortly after graduating, Abeles was drafted into the army in 1957. He was posted to Heidelberg, Germany where he worked as a technical illustrator in a cartography workshop at the US Headquarters Army where he made charts and maps for top secret nuclear war plans. There he rented a house off base in nearby Neckargem√ºnd that belonged to a sculptor. It was here he developed a renewed interest in creating sculptures. After serving two years in the army, he was discharged in Europe and spent the next year touring Italy, Greece and Israel with his then first wife, Gina Godwin. They raised two children, David Paul and Shoshanna Lynn upon coming back to the US. In 1960, Abeles returned to Columbia, SC and found himself without a job. He briefly taught adults at a local community art center until a position opened up at the Swain School of Design in New Bedford, MA recommended to him. It was his first full time teaching job, which was to last three years. The year 1965 was Abeles' strongest New York art world year as a recognized artist there. He was included in that year‚Äôs Whitney Annual which was devoted to his prints and sculpture. Then the Museum of Modern Art bought his etching ‚Äú Self Portrait with Cats‚Äù. That was the only time both his estranged parents attended an art event he was included in. That same year, the National Institute of Arts and Letters awarded Abeles a grant and honor. His early anti war work in drypoint and etching was introduced there by Lewis Mumford. From 1964 to 1969, he was resident artist at Wellesley College which, despite not offering a studio art major at the time, had some of the brightest students the artist recalls having taught. In 1967, Abeles was awarded a sabbatical grant from teaching at Wellesley College by the newly founded National Council of Arts and Humanities which is now called the National Endowment for the Arts. He spent that year making large anti Vietnam war color prints as well as a body of terra cotta sculptures from the figure. In his first 20 years as an artist, Abeles mostly worked in black and white etchings, drawings and sculpture. Color was reintroduced into his works when he discovered pastel which was an extension of his drawings beginning in 1979. Abeles, Sigmund (Jan 21 ‚Äì Mar 6, 1988). \\"A Retrospective\\". UNH.

It has a worldwide distribution, found mostly in soil, dung and root vegetables. This species is described as not known to be able to produce mycotoxins, however it has been frequently reported to infect animals such as cattle and swine, as well as fowl, platypus and occasionally humans. Ketoacidotic patients are particularly at risk for infection by M. circinelloides. History and taxonomy Mucor circinelloides is one of the common species in the genus Mucor. Mucor circinelloides is a variable species that include several variants such as; M. circinelloides f. circinelloides; M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus; M. circinelloides f. griseocyanus and M. circinelloides f. janssenii. Growth and morphology Mucor circinelloides reproduce asexually. The sporangiophores are found as two types: elongate and sympodially branched. The elongate sporangiophores have larger sporangia, which are white at first and progressively turn greenish brown in colour. They assume a globose shape and are 40-80 Œºm in size; characterized as \\"bobbing heads\\". Sporangiophores are mostly sympodially branched with small sporangia (25 Œºm); branches are and sometimes circinate. The diameter of the sporangia range from 20-80 Œºm. Sporangia have slightly encrusted walls. In larger sporangia, the membranes are deliquescent, whereas they are persistent in the smaller ones and rupture at maturity. Smaller sporangia also have smooth persistent walls. Sporangiophores are ellipsoid (6-7 Œºm in diameter) or subglobose (4-6 Œºm in diameter). Numerous chlamydospores are also produced. Colonies are fast growing and go up to 2 cm in height. On Czapek Yeast Autolysate (CYA) plates, the colony growth is low and sparse, most often spreading across the entire Petri dish. These colonies of 60 mm diameter or more appear to be pale grey or yellow in colour, with the reverse being uncoloured. Colonies also fill up the entire Petri dish of malt extract agar, producing colony colours similar to those observed on CYA. Mucor circinelloides can assume a yeast-like growth form. It has been isolated in this yeast form from human urine and normal stool specimen. It has also been recovered as a yeast from frogs. Physiology Mucor circinelloides has good growth and sporulation between 5-10 ‚ÑÉ and very poor growth at 37 ‚ÑÉ which is also the maximum growth temperature. The minimal water activity(aw) for growth is 0.9. M. circinelloides assimilates ethanol and nitrate. The length and number of tall sporangiophores decrease with lower temperatures. Spores are broadly ellipsoid (4.4-6.8 x 3.7-4.7 ¬µm Growth, sporulation, and presence of tall and short sporangiophores can be influenced by temperature; however sporangiophore shape, size and uniformity are not influenced by temperatures. Habitat and ecology At least 20 species belonging to the genus Mucor are found to be extracted from food. M. circinelloides is one of the five most significant fungus out of these 20 along with M. hiemalis, M. piriformis, M. plumbeus and M. racemosus. It has been reported to spoil cheese and yams as well as diseases of mango. This fungus has also been isolated from various foods such as meat, hazelnuts, walnuts, maize, mung beans, soybeans and barley. Fungi in the order Mucorales class have not been investigated in detail for their ability to produce mycotoxins; Cytotoxicity and mycotoxin- production was analysed and tested for using the cytotoxicity test (MTT assay) and LC/MS/MS-based multimycotoxin method respectively for three fungal species, including M. circinelloides. Mucor circinelloides was found to be able to produce 3-nitropropionic acid as well as have low cytotoxicity. Conventionally, M. circinelloides is considered not to produce mycotoxins. Pathogenicity Mucor circinelloides is considered an emerging pathogen, although it has only been associated rarely with very human disease and have been limited to cutaneous infection. This species is occasionally isolated from humans, birds, cattle, and swine.  Antioxidant potential  Mucor circinelloides is potentially a rich source of antioxidants and other secondary metabolites which could be used in the development of nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants.

It was completed in 1837, and has an area of 1250 square meters. Together with the Great Mosque of Sumedang, the government established the mosque a paramount cultural heritage of Islam in 1975. The government's decree was issued by the Archaeology Board of Indonesia which referred to the Antiquities Law on September 1, 1975.  History  The existence of the mosque is inseparable from the history of Tasikmalaya. More than a hundred years ago, Manonjaya used to be the municipality of Tasikmalaya, and referred as Sukapura. Manonjaya Grand Mosque was built around 1832 when the Regent of Sukapura was led by the local ruler Wiradadaha VIII. The construction of the mosque was carried out simultaneously with the transfer of the district capital from Pasirpanjang (now Sukaraja) to Manonjaya (then still called Harjawinangun).  Destruction and restoration  The 2009 West Java earthquake destroyed the mosque. It has also been damaged during the 1977 earthquake, and was subsequently repaired. However, 60 pillars often referred to as Dalem Sewidak could not withstand the magnitude of the 2009 earthquake. The front of the mosque collapsed instantly, and logs buffering the roof were scattered. There were no casualties reported within the mosque area. As of 2012, the restoration of the mosque has been completed.

The organization ensures orphans receive all of their rights, per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  History  Miracle Foundation was founded in May 2000 by Caroline Boudreaux. After a chance encounter with an orphaned toddler in rural India during a vacation in 2000, Boudreaux left her TV advertising career.  United Nations Rights of the Child  Miracle Foundation's method is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Measuring Impact  Miracle Foundation has codified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and works with local leaders and caregivers to improve the quality of care for orphaned children around the world. The organization's measurement tool is called the Thrive Scale, measures progress over time, and helps organizations develop a specific and practical plan to improve.  Programs  The nonprofit's stated mission is to \\"empower orphans to reach their full potential.\\" They do this by reuniting children with their families whenever possible and guaranteeing children a quality education, a safe and loving environment, and personalized care as they transition into family care. The organization has supported more than 13,539 children since 2000 and has transitioned 25% of the children to family care by using their \\"Child-First\\" approach in 3 focus areas: # _Ensure Each Child Thrives._ All children deserve an education, nutrition, health, and protective services‚Äîno matter where they live. That‚Äôs why we developed and implemented the Thrive Scale, a proven care model based on the UN Rights of the Child. Currently, we are working alongside hundreds of orphanages to reunite children with their families and to provide each child with the quality of care and dignity that is their right. # _Strengthen The Childcare System._ Every day around the world, social workers, caregivers, and government officials make decisions that impact millions of orphaned children. They are the ‚Äúboots on the ground.‚Äù Together with UNICEF, we provide training and educational resources that empower workers in the childcare ecosystem to give children a better future. # _Keep Families Together._ Separation of families happens primarily because of family crisis and poverty, not for lack of love. We partner with community programs that identify at-risk children and offer support to vulnerable families long before an orphanage becomes a necessity. Prevention is the key. Miracle Foundation mentors and monitors orphanages, providing capacity building training for leaders and caregivers to improve the quality of care for children. The organization helps orphanages transition into Centers for Excellence, where local leaders can learn about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and how to move their children to family-based care through kinship care, foster care, or adoption. Miracle Foundation created the Child First Digital Toolkit, an online resource for anyone caring for or supporting vulnerable children around the world. Topics include child rights, attachment, child protection, preventing abuse, healthcare, nutrition and more.  Awards & Media Recognition  Miracle Foundation Founder Caroline Boudreaux was honored as one of UBS' Global Visionaries in February 2017, and the organization was awarded the Humanitarian Award by the Austin Chapter of the United Nations Association in October 2017. In February 2015, Miracle Foundation Founder Caroline Boudreaux gave a TEDx talk called \\"Engineering a Miracle,\\" about the global orphan crisis and the work of Miracle Foundation.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Connor Toll House was built in 1858 by James C. Conner. James Conner moved from North Carolina to Hamilton County, Tennessee in 1842. In 1847, he and George Rogers were granted 1,000 acres on Walden's Ridge by Conner's father-in-law, Elisha Rogers. James and his wife, Kizzah, moved their family to Walden's Ridge in July 1858, and shortly thereafter built the home. During the Civil War, the Connor Toll House found service as a message relay station for the Union army. Messages were sent by flashes of fire from Chattanooga to Signal Point. The message was then relayed across Walden's Ridge, and then by fire flash to Jasper in the Sequatchie Valley. The land near the Connor House also served as place to house horses and mules that were too tired or sick to continue hauling people and goods up the steep sides of Walden's Ridge. A corral was built nearby in October 1863, and reportedly had housed nearly 1,500 mules by November 1863. The Connor Toll House also played a role in the development of a transportation network across Walden's Ridge. For many years, the only reliable route up Chattanooga to Walden's Ridge was the \\"W\\" Road. This operated as a toll road, and until the Civil War the toll gate was located at Elisha Roger's home, which was the first house at the top of the road. After the war, the toll gate was moved to the Connor Toll House on Anderson Pike, where it remained until 1892. In addition to operating the toll gate, James Connor served in the Tennessee General Assembly, and three terms as sheriff of Hamilton County. The house was occupied by members of the Connor family until 1975. It was purchased and restored by the Walden's Ridge Historical Association in 1976, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Viktor Martinovich argued that regulating IT under different rules compared to the rest of economy is not a sustainable practice, and that it is necessary to make structural changes in both the economy and government to develop Belarus as a whole.

Ministry of Digital Economy  In 2017, Prokopenya proposed the creation of the Ministry of Digital Economy, which will be responsible for the digitalization of the country. According to him, the Administration of the High Tech Park is now resolving these state issues. In April 2019, at a meeting between the president and the IT business, Lukashenko approved this initiative.  Public initiatives  Viktor Prokopenya  State debt of Belarus  On November 5, 2018, at the International Economic Forum (IEF) Prokopenya supported the idea of a moratorium relating to the death penalty in Belarus. He argued that this is good for society and that this would reduce the cost of interest payouts on the state debt of Belarus. Prokopenya said that Belarus pays around 5% a year interest on debt obligations and that this is high for Belarus, which has debt less than 30% of its GDP. Critics argued that his calculations are inaccurate and that there is no connection between abolishing the death penalty in Belarus and reducing the country's debt burden. Some critics agreed that a moratorium on the death penalty will improve relations between Belarus and the European Union, and that this could affect the rating of the Belarusian Eurobonds and possibly rendering new debt cheaper.  Specialist training for IT Belarus  Viktor Prokopenya speaks a lot in public about the small number of specialists for the new IT-Belarus economy and the low level of education of university graduates: \\"One of the latest initiatives of our community is to send $ 15 million to IT education from the High Tech Park fund. Every year we can teach thousands of students.\\" In October 2019, President Lukashenko supported Prokopenya's proposal to create an experimental IT university. Lukashenko also supported Prokopeny's idea about interest-free loans for education in the knowledge economy. The entrepreneur talks a lot about digitalization of schools. In December 2018 VP Capital and personally Viktor Prokopeny–∞ presented 600 tablets with textbooks in Russian and Belarusian to students of Belarusian schools. In April 2019, Prokopenya proposed to Lukashenko ideas for improving the school system, including: electronic document management, virtual video tutorials, a personalized teaching method, and in-depth career guidance. Prokopenya suggested making more English lessons in schools, changing the curriculum and teacher payment system. Lukashenko supported these initiatives. Some of them will be adopted in the near future, some will be tested first in an experimental school.  Detention and media relations  In the spring of 2015, Viktor Prokopenya was detained by Belarusian state authorities and was suspected in unregistered business activity, earning profits to the sum of $650,000. Deutsche Welle, and Belarusian IT experts alleged that the detainment of Viktor Prokopenya could potentially cause hundreds of million of dollars in damages to Belarus. The IT business community came to the defense of Prokopenya. Viktor Prokopenya was released on bail. In February 2016, all allegations against him were dropped after authorities failed to uncover any violations. The story of the investigation gained widespread media coverage in Belarus. At the end of 2017, Prokopenya's legal advisors approached various Belarusian media channels, including BelaPAN, BelTA, European Radio for Belarus, Narodnaja Volya, Nasha Niva, Onliner.by, Tut.By, requesting the removal or correction of old news stories which contained incorrect information. In their opinion, the legal facts in the materials were in fact incorrect. Many outlets agreed that the information was incorrect and corrected the publications or deleted them, and this provoked the discussions journalism ethics. Prokopenya has repeatedly spoken out publicly in defense of the media and against state pressure on sites. In January 2018, he opposed the blocking of Charter 97 and Belarusian Partisan sites. Prokopenya said that this situation would complicate international relations and damage the image of Belarus. In August 2018, the businessman wrote in the media that the power structures of Belarus should release the detained journalists and editors of TUT.BY, BelaPAN and other Belarusian media. He said that this is how the country takes a huge step back.  Honours and awards  The Belarusian media has repeatedly included Prokopenya in the rankings of notable Belarusian entrepreneurs. In the list of the 200 most successful and influential businessmen of Belarus, published by the Internet newspaper Ezednevnik, Prokopenya was awarded the 184th place in 2011, the 47th in 2013, the 45th in 2016, the 23rd in 2017, the 12th in 2018, and the 9th in 2019. In the list of 25 most influential businessmen of Belarus from 1992 till 2017, also published by Ezhednevnik, he received 13th place. Viktor Prokopenya has been named Belarus's \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\" three times. In 2019, in parliament of Great Britain, Prokopenya has been awarded for his outstanding contribution to the development of the legislation in the IT area in Belarus and for creation of one of the most beneficial legal frameworks for IT businesses in post-Soviet countries. In April 2020, Prokopenya has 6,5 million followers on Instagram making him the most followed instagrammer in Belarus,  Personal life  Prokopenya is married and has three sons: Mikhail, Mark, and Artur. He lives and works in London. His hobbies include photography, hockey, snowboarding, diving, cycling and reading.

Her father ran a school. She was awarded a Litt.D. by Tufts College in 1905. For 20 years, she served as editor of the Home Department of The Christian Leader. She was the author of Victory, Out of Sight, Romance of the New Bethesda, and Buena Vista Windows. She also wrote 400 short poems, short stories and essays. Patterson was a Universalist and conducted services, assisted in the pulpit including at funerals. Early years Lippitt was the daughter of Daniel Lippitt and Catharine Burch. She was born in Otsego, New York on 4 June 1829. Her father owned and cultivated land, and in winter he kept the district school. Patterson learned early all the homely tasks of farm life. She could spin flax, tow and wool, and before she was 12 years old, she made summer clothes for a younger brother out of linen which she had helped to manufacture. At the age of 10, the family removed from New York to Pennsylvania, settling in Summit Township, Crawford County, a region comparatively new. Forests covered more than half the farm as the local houses were built of logs. For a brief period, her mother was homesick when she saw the home and its wild surroundings. Education As a child, she was thoughtful and studious. She never appeared in school with a half-learned lesson. The \\"Log School-house on the Gore,\\" which Patterson memorialized in one of her stories, \\"Willitts and I,\\" furnished the neighborhood an intellectual center, and in summer, when some girl acted as teacher, or in winter, when an old professor graced the low room, there was enough to learn, and, always, either there or at home, the needed help for Patterson. At the age of 12, she became ill, and for three years, was unable to attend the \\"Log School-house on the Gore\\". When she returned with regularity, at the age of 15, it was in the capacity of teacher. She was then scarcely well, and the walk down and up the precipitous banks of Pine Run accelerated her heart-beats much beyond what was healthy for her, but the school needed a teacher, and she needed the school. During the years of sickness, she studied constantly when not wholly prostrated. Under the daily instruction of her competent father, her progress had been more rapid than if she had been a pupil in a seminary. The meditations of those weeks when confined to the bed were perhaps the best preparation for the next phase of her life. One day, an aunt, who made her home with the family, and was interested and helpful, almost like a mother, sat reading the New Testament aloud in Patterson's room. It interested her to the extent that Patterson took the Bible and read it herself seven times. At the beginning of her religious inquiry she found a helper, a neighbor, Benjamin Skiff, who loaned her books‚Äîthe \\"Life of Murray,\\" \\"Ballou's Sermons,\\" an English treatise on Endless Punishment, and other works. Career Western Pennsylvania When she was 16, she taught school in the Rundell neighborhood. Nearly every patron of the school was a Universalist. About this time, she began to send occasional poems and letters to \\"The New Covenant\\". She also published a few pieces in the \\"Trumpet\\" and the \\"Star.\\" Samuel P. Skinner, editor of the \\"Covenant,\\" mentioned Patterson's contributions favorable, and inserted everything which she sent. At the age of 22, on August 26, 1851, she married Rev. Adoniram Judson Patterson, D.D., and went with him to his mother's house, where they lived nearly two years. Rev. Patterson's parents had dedicated him to the ministry from his birth, and his early education was directed to this profession, but the death of his father rendered it necessary that Rev. Patterson sort out certain business dealings so that his mother might have financial security. The young wife lent a hand in the business endeavors. In the spring of 1858, they left the home of Rev. Patterson's mother for Western Pennsylvania, being centered in Girard, Pennsylvania. For more than two years, Patterson worked with her husband in the growth of the minister. Had the opportunity for woman been available at the time, she would have been a minister. During the two years in Girard and the 11 years passed in Portsmouth, New Hampshire she gave little to the press. An occasional poem or a brief letter was all she could provide. She took care of her house, and did what she could to help the old and sick of the parish. When an editor, who had been guest in her home, asked her for articles for his magazine, she professed to understand him as desiring a recipe for making bread, which she wrote out with great precision, and which he published. American Civil War Victory The American Civil War shook her and her letters became voluminous, full of the passing events of the time. She scarcely wrote a poem. On a certain evening, feeling great loneliness, she began a story of the times. On other lonely evenings she took up the theme, until she had written 150 manuscript pages. The prizes of the series which was published while R. A. Ballou was agent of the Boston House, were pending. Ballou suggested to Rev. Patterson that his wife write. There was yet a month before the close of the time when the manuscripts must be in. To finish the story already begun in so brief a time, with all the work of the home pending, seemed impossible. But there was no time to pause. It was at once decided that Rev. Patterson should prepare the dinners, and relieve his wife of all company during the early part of the day, and she would try to finish the story in the time allotted. She found the quietest corner of the house, and went to work on a Monday morning. She hung her watch in front of her, that she might not be tempted to dream over her sentences. She made from 25-28 pages each morning for five days in the week, giving Saturday to domestic duties. After dinner, she ransacked great files of \\"The Rebellion Record,\\" that the dates of events might be entirely accurate, and sometimes, over-weary, slept. In three weeks, the story was completed. On the fourth, she copied the first 150 pages, which were written on scraps of any sort, never thinking of the printer, and sent on her manuscript several days before the expiration of time. In that day, there were on record few equal feats of rapid writing. The committee spent nearly a year reading the manuscripts, of which there were over 30. The first prize was unanimously awarded to Patterson's story. Competent judges are of the opinion that if Victory had been published as soon as it was written, and just at the close of the war, it would have circulated widely. As it was, the sale was largely within the Universalist denomination, the outside world fearing a secular book with the Universalist stamp. Out of Sight As it was passing through the press, in the Spring of 1866, the agent of the house urged Patterson to write a serial for the \\" Ladies' Repository\\". She had assisted him in editing the magazine during the winter, and had written two short stories, \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Pine Sun Bridge.\\" She undertook the task of a long story with great reluctance, doubting her strength to accomplish it adequately. But the need of the Universalist church of books suitable for Sunday school, she produced Out of Sight, a story into which she wove much of her own life. While it was passing through \\"Ladies' Repository\\", the house changed agents, and the story was never re-published in book form, according to the original intention. Massachusetts The change of homes to Roxbury, Boston came about this time, and the sorrow of leaving old places and friends, and especially her beloved sister and her growing family, coupled with the over-strain in her work, brought on nervous prostration, which rendered her a semi-invalid for two or three years, and from which she did not wholly recover. She was obliged to do her mental work in the mornings, even the writing of a letter after dinner often causing great prostration. Her contributions of prose and verse to the \\"Ladies' Repository\\" while Mrs. Bingham edited the magazine, were as frequent as her strength would allow. The first time they met. Patterson had in hand a story of 20 pages or more, with which Bingham was pleased to read, and it appeared in the first number which she edited. After \\"Willitts and I,\\" came \\" The Belle of the Prairie,\\" \\"Over the Plains,\\" \\"Which is Better,\\" \\"The Romance of High Rocks,\\" \\"My Lost Banker,\\" and other prose articles and poems. In January, 1879, Patterson became one of the editors of the \\"Christian Leader,\\" having exclusive charge of the \\"Home Department.\\" By stipulation, her work was chiefly that of selection. But was not content to fill the page always with the thoughts of others, and when the spirit moved her she wrote a poem or a story. Friends outside her church tried to enlist Patterson in secular periodicals, assuring her that she could receive much greater compensation; but she was so consecrated a Universalist that she was never tempted to do so. Pulpit In the summer of 1872, she traveled west with her sick husband, and was prostrated in St. Paul, Minnesota with malarious fever. Up to that time, she had suffered greatly from diffidence, dreading to face strangers and never lifting her voice even in the conference room. Face to face with death, she forgot to care what the world might say of her or her work. When her husband, after their return, was again prostrated by illness, she went at his urgent plea into his pulpit and conducted the Sunday service. The people, who knew how shrinking she had been in the past, were electrified at her appearance in this high place. After the service, which the people said was conducted as if she had \\"done it a thousand times,\\" they gathered about her, and requested that she take the place of her husband whenever he needed the assistance of a minister, if she was able to do so. He was ill at repeated intervals, and she served in his stead several times. When his health became restored, she took care of her home, unless some sick minister or needy church or institution called for her help. Patterson had a deep interest in young ministers and in the young men fitting for the ministry. Many of the young men, while in college, stayed in her home, and about a dozen affectionately called her mother. When a class in the Divinity School requested of her a poem for their Zetagathean Anniversary, she wrote \\"The Divine Call.\\" With no children of her own to educate, Patterson was attentive upon the education of the young. Almost constantly for many years, one or more young persons lived in her home, while studying in Boston schools. In the summer of 1878, Rev. Patterson visited Europe. As soon as the voyage was suggested, the Committee of the Roxbury parish asked that Patterson supply the pulpit until her husband's return. She cheerfully accepted the charge, not only preaching on Sunday and attending the Sunday-school and the week-day meetings, but visiting the sick, attending funerals, and answering every call for help, and the congregation steadily increased in size.

Plot Late at night, Dr. Benson drives through the countryside and stumbles upon a car crash where he finds a wounded young woman named Susan. Dr. Benson gets Susan in his car and seeks shelter for the two in a nearby castle. He is greeted at the door by Evelyn, who looks exactly like Susan, and is invited to stay the night. Dr. Benson soon meets his own doppelg√§nger named Peter. When in the castle, Dr. Benson discovers that in Satan's work, time and space do not follow ordinary logic. Style Film historian Roberto Curti described Nude for Satan as walking a thin edge between erotic horror and pornography as other films of the period did. Curti described the film as \\"tempted to jump to the other side of the fence but still retaining some prudish reservation\\". Production Rita Calderoni starred in the film as both Susan Smith and Evelyn. Rita Calderoni claimed that director Luigi Batzella had cast her in the film after seeing her in Riti, magie nere e segrete orge nel Trecento. According to the Public Cinematographic Register, Nude for Satan began filming on March 25, 1974. It was shot at the Castle of Monte San Giovanni Campano in Frosinone, Lazio. Calderoni stated that the film shoot took five or six weeks. Calderoni recalled that the car accident scene in the film took Batzella an entire night to film. In the finished film, the accident is represented by a single tire rolling into frame. Calderoni recollected that she was injured during the spider attack sequence in the film. Release Nude for Satan was initially rejected by the board of censors in Italy due to \\"continuous obscene sequences, some of them even portraying lesbian intercourses\\". On appeal, several cuts to the film were suggested to the producer. This included removing scenes involving sexual intercourse between the doctor and the woman who represents Susan's double, a reduction of Susan's nightmare scene to avoid a \\"description of lesbian intercourse\\", and to \\"avoid erotic acts of the main characters in a chair\\" from the final scene of the film. The producer obliged and the film was released in Italy with a V.M.18 rating. Nude for Satan was released in Italy on 23 October 1974 where it was distributed by P.A.B. The film grossed a total of 56,364,000 Italian lire domestically. Nude for Satan was released on DVD and VHS by Image Entertainment in 1999. Reception In retrospective reviews, Curti described the film's direction as \\"clueless\\" noting that Batzella \\"cannot find a formal balance and keeps piling up whatever comes to his mind.\\" In his book Perverse Titillation, Danny Shipka summarized the plot noting that \\"the Devil is bored and wants to have an orgy. Oh, and Calderoni gets molested by a giant spider. You'll be bored too.\\" In his book Italian Horror Film Directors, Louis Paul declared the film to be a \\"demented exercise into semi-pornographic skin flick horror\\"  References  Footnotes Sources External links * Italian films Gothic horror films Italian supernatural horror films 1974 horror films Italian horror films Films shot in Italy ","title":"Nude for Satan"},{"id":"55238470","text":"was a Japanese hurdler.

History Dakhlalla graduated from Starkville High School with a 4.0 GPA and is a 2015 graduate of Mississippi State University with a degree in psychology, had plans to work on a master's degree in psychology when he met Jaelyn Young. Shortly thereafter, Young converted to Islam and convinced Dakhlalla to leave home in Starkville and travel to Syria by way of Turkey, where they had plans to be wed. Young was reportedly inspired by the killing of five service members in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 2014 and 2015, the pair of them watched a number of ISIS propaganda videos featuring Anjem Choudary on the internet, and came to believe that the American media offered a \\"complete cloud of falsehood.\\" Moe joined in and downloaded the ISIS guide to emigrating to Syria. In May 2015, the FBI made contact with Young, and soon thereafter with Dakhlalla in order to gather evidence of their plans to join the terrorist group. The two had an Islamic marriage ceremony in 2015, but were not officially married, using a honeymoon as pretext for a trip to Turkey. In July, Dakhlalla made statements asserting his usefulness to ISIS in computers, education and media, and stated his willingness to fight. While they made elaborate plans for their journey, the two hid their intentions so poorly they came to the attention of various monitoring groups, including the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. They were arrested at Golden Triangle Regional Airport on August 10, 2015 while attempting to board a flight for Europe on their way to join ISIS. When the FBI visited Dakhlallas parents in Starkville, he initially thought it was a social visit and was shocked to find that his son had been arrested. Sentencing U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock sentenced Dakhlalla to 8 years in prison and a further 15 years of probation on the charge of conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization. At the time of sentencing, he thanked the lead FBI agent for saving his life for preventing him from traveling to Syria.

Although she only lived to the age of 26, Zvereva is recognized for her feats as a female aviator. She competed in air shows in Eastern Europe, and later, with her husband Vladimir Victorovich Slusarenko, Zvereva operated an aircraft manufacturing factory in Riga.  Biography  Born in Saint Petersburg in 1890 into a military family, Zvereva was educated at the Czar Nicholas I Institute for Girls. In 1910, a succession of exhibits held in Russia assembled French and German pilots while promoting an enthusiasm for aviation in the Russian public. One pioneering French pilot active in the events, Raymonde de Laroche, broke barriers as the world's first woman licensed to fly, and hence encouraged other women to participate in the field of aviation, including Zvereva. The following year, on 22 August 1911 (10 August on the old style Russian calendar), Zvereva earned certificate No. 31 from the Russian Aviation Association Flying School in Gatchina, recognizing her as the first Russian woman to earn a pilot's license and the eighth woman overall. Lidiya Zvereva in 1911 For a while, Zvereva partnered with sportsman and aviator E. Spitzberg in air shows throughout Eastern Europe, flying in a Farman IV for high-altitude competitions. Several events, however, forbade Zvereva from participating or demanded excessively high entry fees. Such occurrences and the burden of traveling to exhibits led her to consider establishing an aircraft manufacturing factory with Vladimir Victorovich Slusarenko, her husband and former flight instructor. With the help of motorist Fjodor Kalep, Zvereva and Slusarenko signed a governmental contract to organize a repair workshop and training school in Riga; by mid-1914, the organization produced ten Farman XVI aircraft. Following the outbreak of the First World War, the operation relocated and expanded in Saint Petersburg where Farmans and Morane-type aircraft were mass manufactured. Zvereva infrequently test flew modified aircraft, mainly to evaluate the mechanics of the newer models. On 19 May 1914, Zvereva, in a Morane monoplane, performed aerobatics in front of a sold-out crowd in the hippodrome in Riga. For the occasion, she executed a loop ‚Äì the first female aviator to execute such a maneuver ‚Äì much to the astonishment of the spectators. However, in April 1916, Zvereva contracted typhoid fever; she died on 1 May at the age of 26. \\"She was buried in Alexander Nevski Monastery while an aerial formation flew over the cemetery in her honor\\".

Zeiger's family immigrated from Ukraine (the part of Ukraine that was then part of Poland) to Brazil in the early 1920s. David, with his siblings and mother, met with his father Shaja Zeiger, who had left Poland a year earlier. Shaja Zeiger was a tailor, and in a few years founded Goomtex, a factory for raincoats and overcoats. As a young man, David Zeiger worked with his father, and soon became the manager of the business. After his marriage, David Zeiger began to run Pullsport‚Äîa women's fashion factory‚Äîalong with his wife Mila. David Zeiger also dedicated his energy to the areas of culture, philanthropy, and publicity. Early Years and Education left Zeiger was born in Kovel, Poland, which is now part of Ukraine. Although raised and educated within the community of Jewish immigrants in the S√£o Paulo neighborhood of Bom Retiro, the adolescent Zeiger already had a good command of Portuguese and a curiosity for Brazilian culture that led him to seek friendships outside the small European community where he lived. He became a member of the Esp√©ria club, and of the Tiet√™ regatta club in which he participated as a rower in competitions. He joined the Portug√°lia club, which published a newspaper with texts written by various members. His news stories and fiction began to be published under the guidance of the poet Mario Gallo. Zeiger finished his education at the S√£o Paulo Technical School of Accounting. Community Activities 190px 180px After World War II, Zeiger began his philanthropic activities.

During the Juscelino Kubitschek administration (1956 to 1961), he found a favorable climate for this view, which would help Brazil to move out of its agrarian economy to become an industrial giant. At that time Zeiger met congressman Ant√¥nio S√≠lvio Cunha Bueno, with whom he developed a long friendship, and through which he began to participate more actively in the political life of the country. Zeiger promoted Cunha Bueno within the Jewish community. The friendship with the Cunha Bueno family resulted in two homages: David Zeiger Public School, and David Zeiger Street, both in S√£o Paulo. Career 150px During the years of the \\"Economic Miracle\\" in the 1960s and 1970s, David Zeiger's business expanded quickly.

In 1851, he founded the Galt Grammar School and served as its headmaster until 1881. He later became the principal at Peterborough Collegiate Institute. Tassie was opposed to efforts in Upper Canada to reform the education system to focus on practical education, and was an advocate of a classical education. Early life and education Tassie was born on 10 March 1815 in Dublin, Ireland. He was the third child of Mary (n√©e Stewart) and James Tassie. He had seven brothers and sisters. In 1834 Tassie and his wife moved with the rest of his family to Nelson Township in Upper Canada. In 1856 he was awarded a Bachelors of Arts from the University of Toronto, and in 1858 he received a Master of Arts from the same institution. Career In 1851, Tassie founded the Galt Grammar School, which became a prominent school in Canada that attracted students from both Canada and the United States. Tassie supported classical education, and was opposed to coeducation. In the 1870s, Tassie was criticized for his refusal to adapt to provincial standards that emphasized practical education over a classical one when his students began to perform poorly on their provincial examinations. He attempted to convince Egerton Ryerson in 1871 to allow him to continue to hold the then illegal preparatory classes. He argued that with private schools available, parents could choose to withdraw their children if they did not have the opportunity to learn Latin early. In a radio broadcast, Henry John Cody commended Tassie as an effective teacher of the classics but questioned his reluctance to adopt newer teaching methodologies. Cody noted: > \\"But he wrought a great work in his generation. His personality created in a > famous school an atmosphere of loyalty to the institution, which fostered > all the higher loyalties of life, and he sent forth into the broad fields of > the Dominion hundreds of youth imbued with fine ideals of sincerity, > thoroughness, perseverance, and public service. This is no mean legacy to > leave to any people in any age\\". In spring 1881 Tassie resigned as headmaster of Galt after facing criticism for refusing to change his educational methods. In fall 1881 he founded a new boarding school in Yorkville that also followed a classical education model. In 1884 he was hired as the headmaster at Peterborough Collegiate Institute. He again refused to update his teaching philosophy, but was hired with the intent of improving the discipline at the school. From 1869 to 1870 Tassie was the head of the Ontario Grammar School Teachers' Association, and in 1871 he continued to serve in that capacity after it transformed into the Ontario Grammar School Masters' Association. Queen's College granted Tassie an honorary Legum Doctor in 1871. Personal life Tassie married Sarah Morgan in Dublin in 1834. The couple was childless. Tassie died of a stroke on 21 November 1886 in Peterborough, Ontario.

Vogel. Throughout the film series, McCall is \\"a man of principle who roams the West of yesteryear helping people in trouble while struggling to get himself out of trouble‚Äîclearing himself of a false murder charge\\".Vincent Terrace, Encyclopedia of Television Pilots, 1937‚Äì2012 (2013), p. 73.

The first TV movie was originally intended to serve as the pilot for a weekly TV series, but the series did not materialize, and the film instead had four TV movie sequels, also starring McArthur as McCall. The title was inspired by the 1973 Eagles song Desperado, which also served as the theme music for the series, performed by Don Henley.Walter Mirisch, I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History (2008), p. 372-74. Desperado (April 27, 1987) In the first film, McCall \\"finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly feud in a frontier mining town\\", and falling in love with a local girl named Nora, played by Lise Cutter. The original screenplay was written by Elmore Leonard,Desperado - Elmore Leonard.com. who, with Walter Mirisch, convinced Brandon Tartikoff of NBC to finance the project. The film was produced by Mirisch's son Drew, who initially hired John Byrum to direct, but Byrum agreed to withdraw from the position when disharmony arose over the work he was producing. Virgil W. Vogel was then brought in to direct, and helmed the project to completion. Although the film received \\"excellent notices and ratings\\", NBC declined to pick up it up as a series, preferring to order additional 2-hour TV movies continuing the story of the original. The Return of Desperado (February 15, 1988) The second film centered on McCall dealing with \\"a crooked sheriff committing crimes and blaming others\\". After the second film broadcast, NBC sought to implement a series after all, but by that time, the contract obligating McArthur for a weekly series had expired. The actor, whose star was on the rise, was no longer interested in being \\"tied up to a weekly series\\". NBC then ordered two additional TV movies. Desperado: Avalanche at Devil's Ridge (May 24, 1988) The third film centered on a character portrayed by Rod Steiger, playing \\"a desperate man who forces McCall to rescue his kidnapped daughter\\". Desperado: The Outlaw Wars (October 10, 1989) In the fourth film, McCall \\"learns that he has fathered a son with Nora\\", and encounters \\"Richard Farnsworth as a serious-minded lawman, [and] James Remar as a cold-blooded killer\\". Desperado: Badlands Justice (December 17, 1989) By the end of Badlands Justice, McCall had still not been able to clear his name, leading critics to anticipate further installments resolving this issue; however, no more of the films were made.F. Maurice Speed, James Cameron-Wilson, Film Review (1990), p. 129.

It was founded by Sylvie Cotton and Claire Bourque. Its offices are located in a construction trailer, decorated by artists and stationed in different districts (mostly in parks) on the island of Montreal. The name given by the center to these successive temporary locations is Dis/location: urban articulation project. DARE-DARE is exclusively dedicated to the production and presentation of public art, although this was not always the case since its foundation. Its activities consist of hosting the work of selected artists following an annual call for applications, organizing openings (mostly outdoor), outdoor screenings, day camps and collaborations with other arts organizations, like the Viva! Art Action, an international action art and performance biennale. The main fundraising activity of DARE-DARE consists of an annual sale of passports used for the collection of artistic interventions in different points of the city. The center is active throughout the whole year and its actions are divided into 7 parts (public intervention, critical space, public writing, transmission, outreach, halt and special projects).  History  In 1985, as part of the International Youth Year, Sylvie Cotton and Claire Bourque founded the art gallery DARE-DARE. They then gave a first three-part mandate to the center: to allow young artists to exhibit and sell their works, to offer a transitional venue to artists before entering the established galleries, and finally, to educate the general population (and especially the local people) on current art practices. Located at this time on Laurier Street, the center presented a new exhibition every two weeks, totalling 28 artists of different disciplines in the first year. With the initial aim of sensitizing new audiences, the center has supported and still supports the efforts of artists who wish to meet other audiences and compare their practice with a specific context different from that of the workshop or the gallery. 8 The center is at the origin of many events: the Festival des musiciennes innovatrices (1986), Art et litt√©rature f√©ministe (1988), Dansit√© (1988), 11 artistes dans leurs quartiers (1990), Les Femmes l‚ÄôArt et la Joie (as part of the Center's fifth anniversary in 1990) and Les Cracheurs d'images (1993). DARE-DARE is also one of the founding centers of VIVA! Art Action (first edition in 2006). From its first premises in an old barber shop at 1320 Laurier Street East, the center has changed its address more than four times, which means that travel is an integral part of its history. In 1987, the center was located at 4060 Saint- Laurent Boulevard, in 1990 at 279 Sherbrooke West and in the summer of 1996 at 460 Sainte-Catherine Ouest, increasingly closer to the business center of Montreal. Since 2004, DARE-DARE is pursuing its urban articulation project called Dis/location. The project involves relocating the offices of the center, newly housed in a construction trailer, through various districts of the city of Montreal.  Chronology  * 1985 : Foundation as an NPO. * 1990 : Designation as artist-run center,. * 1990-2004 : Gallery project diffusion (fixed space). * 2004 : Transition from a fixed gallery space to a succession of mobile locations (Dis / location). * 2004-2017 : Presentation of public art projects. * 2011 : Temporary export of the center to Detroit and Tijuana. * 2017 : Creation of the HALTE (Reference and reflection pavilion on art in the public space).  Mission  To explore, question and evolve contemporary art practices, spaces and modes of dissemination and to promote their democratization and accessibility.  Mandate  DARE-DARE supports the research and development of innovative practices by artists, be they just starting out or seasoned professionals. The artist centre has had a long- standing interest in exploring and diversifying art work and intervention design processes, forms of expression and modes of presentation within diverse contexts not traditionally intended for art. The artist centre encourages collaboration with various cultural and/or community organizations, as well as with partners who are not within the art field. DARE-DARE has as its objective to promote education, understanding and appreciation of contemporary art at a local, national and international level. This is achieved throughout a range of activities including: research, creation, production, dissemination, documentation, publishing, workshops, as well as artist discussions and forums.  Activities  The Center's activities, following an annual call for projects, are also grouped under a specific theme that also changes each year. They are available in a series of different parts simultaneously.  Part 1 - Public space interventions  Project presented in the public spaces that surround the current location of the center.  Part 2 - Critical space  Residency of theoretical research and writing of one to two months which concludes with a public presentation and the printing of a pamphlet.  Part 3 - Public writings  Literary/poetic research residency exhibited in a textual form on an outdoor advertising light box near the center,.  Special projects  Special projects (mainly collaborations between the center and other artists and/or organizations) may manifest themselves spontaneously and take a form that is not related to any of the previous parts.  Dis/location  From 2004, the location of the artist-run center changes on an ad hoc basis. * March√© Atwater (2015- ) * Esplanade M√©tro Saint-Laurent (2012-2015) at the quartier des spectacles,. * Parc Walter Stewart (2009-2012) * D√©troit and Tijuana (2011) * Cabot square (2008-2009) * Parc sans nom (2006-2008) * Viger square (2004-2006)  Awards  * 2014 Gala des arts visuels - Best event or exhibition in an artist-run center * 2010 Grafika Award - Printed media (book) DIS / LOCATION I (design: Denis Rioux)  Publications  * Orbitae : Dare-Dare 1996-1997 * Mobilit√© et R√©sonances * M√©moire vive + L‚Äôalg√®bre d‚ÄôAriane * Dis/location 1 : projet d'articulation urbaine : Viger square * Dis/location 2 : projet d'articulation urbaine : le parc sans nom * 3 DIS/LOCATIONs : projet d'articulation urbaine : Cabot square / Walter-Stewart park / Quartier des spectacles * Vers libres : Cinq ans d'√©critures publiques sur l'enseigne lumineuse de DARE-DARE  References   Attachments   Organizations whose center is a member  * RCAAQ (R√©seau des Centres d'artistes autog√©r√©s du Qu√©bec) * RAIQ (Regroupement des Arts Interdisciplinaires du Qu√©bec)  External links  * Official site 1985 establishments in Canada Art museums and galleries in Quebec ","title":"Dare-Dare (artist-run centre)"},{"id":"55238889","text":"The Oklahoma gubernatorial election of 1910 was held on November 8, 1910, and was a race for the Governor of Oklahoma.

Early life Hannah Tyler was born in Boonville, New York, on August 31, 1838. Her father, Amos Tyler, was a cousin of President John Tyler. His liberal ideas on the subject of woman's education were far in advance of his generation. Her mother's father, Joseph Lawton, was a patron of education and one of the founders of the first medical college in New York, in Fairfield, Herkimer County. His home and purse were open to the students and professors, and thus Elizabeth Lawton learned to love the science of medicine, though not permitted to study it. Hannah Tyler attended the academies in Holland Patent, New York, and Rome, New York, and, being desirous of a higher education than could there be obtained, she went to the Pennsylvania Female College, near Philadelphia, where she was graduated with honors in 1860. Career A call came to the president of the college for a teacher to take charge of an academy in southwest Missouri. This involved a journey three-hundred miles by stage coach south of St. Louis, Missouri. Tyler resolved to accept the position, and in one year she built up a successful school, when the war of 1861 made it unsafe for a teacher of northern views to remain, and she returned to her native town. She entered into the medical profession with her husband and studied in the various schools, the allopathic, eclectic, and later, desiring to know if there was any best in \\"pathies\\" of medicine, she took a degree in the homeopathic school in St. Louis, where she resided many years. She was a believer in the curative powers of electricity, and many of her cures were on record, with the skillful use of various means of healing the sick. She encourage her colleagues to investigate the physiological and psychological benefits of oxytocic electricity to obviate the need for drugs and forceps during delivery and prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Her great aim was the advancement of her sex. She was prominent in all the great movements of and for women, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Woman's Relief Corps and the educational and industrial unions. She was a member of the National American Institute of Homoeopathy, and was a delegate from St. Louis and Missouri to the convention in Saratoga, New York, in 1887. She was medical examiner for ten years for the Order of Chosen Friends. Her lectures on health and dress for women aided materially in reform. Personal life In 1862 Hannah Tyler became the wife of Dr M. W. Wilcox, of Rochester, New York. They went to Warrensburg, Missouri, and there witnessed some of the stirring scenes of that period of national strife. Three times they witnessed the alternation of Federal and Confederate rule. In 1887 her health failed from overwork, and she sought the invigorating climate of southern California, in Los Angeles. When her health was restored, she returned to her home in St. Louis. She was a widow for many years and had one living son. In 1892 she moved to Chicago, Illinois. She died after 1905.

History Garald's fortress Haraldsborg was according to Saxo Grammaticus built by Harald Kesja. It was most likely a ring fortification with palisades. Saxo mentions a revolving wooden tower, but such structures are not known from archeological excavations. Harald Kesja plundered far and wide, which greatly contributed to his not being elected king after his father died in 1103. Instead, his uncle Niels of Denmark was elected king in 1104. In 1133, Haraldsborg came under siege by Harald's half-brother Eric Emune and fell after local German craftsmen from Roskilde had assisted Eric in the construction of a trebuchet. Haraldsborg was part of Queen Dorothea's dower lands. Hendrik Behrmann claims that the last remains of Haraldsborg were destroyed by German soldiers during the Count's Feud in 1534. The watermill Haraldsborg Watermill photographed by Kristian Hude after the fire in 1909 A watermill is first mentioned at the site in 1295, when Erik Menved granted it to St. Agnes' Priory in Roskilde. It later came into the procession of Duebr√∏dre Kloster. The watermill is also seen on the oldest maps of Roskilde. In 1677, Rosen refers to it as Den Haralds M√∏lle (\\"The Harald's Mill\\"), while it is referred to as Haraldsborg M√∏lle in 1753. The watermill and the associated four-winged farm building were destroyed in a fire in 1909. Haraldsborg Husholdningsskole In 1910, Haraldsborg was converted into a training facility for aspiring housewives (husholdningsskole). Haraldsborg Husholdningsskole was led by Anna Bransager Nielsen and had after a few years grown to be one of the largest of its kind in Denmark. It closed in 1954. Roskilde Municipality purchased the building in 1957 and converted it into a senior citizens' home. It was later converted into a home for psychiatric patients and has more recently housed asylum seekers.

Early life and education Born in Bedford Hills, New York, Knowles began training as an actor with the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, as part of its Advanced Teen Conservatory. He graduated with a B.A. in History and Italian from Yale University, where he produced the first English rendering of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's play Andria in 2012. Knowles is of Italian descent. Knowles was raised in the Catholic faith by his family, but had fallen away during his adolescence; while at Yale he experienced a reconversion to the Church, spurred at first by ontological arguments. Career  Acting  Before graduating from Yale, Knowles participated in two web series: Never Do Business with Friends and Survive. Upon graduation, Knowles trained with Wynn Handman at his acting studio in New York City and appeared in various web series, films, and television shows. After moving to Los Angeles, he acted in the TV pilot Blend In, the TV movie I'm Back!, and the comedy HollyWeird. Knowles also is the voice actor in the fictional podcast and audiobook \\"Another Kingdom\\", directed and produced by colleague Andrew Klavan. Political commentary In 2016, Knowles was invited to join The Daily Wire, beginning as regular guest and cultural correspondent for The Andrew Klavan Show podcast. Knowles previously worked with Andrew Klavan's son, Spencer, on theater productions while they were undergraduates at Yale. In 2017, Knowles released an empty book called Reasons to Vote for Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide. The book, which contained 266 empty pages and an extensive bibliography, became the number 1 best-selling book on Amazon. Shortly after Knowles lauded President Donald Trump on Fox & Friends, Trump in return praised Knowles' book as \\"a great book for your reading enjoyment.\\" That year, Knowles began his role as host of The Daily Wires third podcast, The Michael Knowles Show. In January 2020, while the impeachment proceedings of President Donald Trump were underway, Knowles and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, launched a podcast titled Verdict with Ted Cruz.Kastrenakes, Jacob (2020-01-22). ‚ÄúTed Cruz Now Has an Impeachment Podcast, Too.‚Äù Ted Cruz now has an impeachment podcast, too.\\" The Verge.

Initially a loyal supporter of King Charles I, he turned against the royal power and established a de facto independent province in Zempl√©n County after 1312, exploiting that political vacuum, which emerged following the dissolution of the Abas' dominion. Early life There is nothing known about his origin and family relationships. Historian Tam√°s K√°d√°r assumes a possible Slavic (Ruthenian) descent. His father was a certain Petenye (also Petene or Pethune), who served as Master of the treasury in the court of Elizabeth, spouse of junior king Stephen. The family's landholdings laid in the surrounding lordship of Patak Castle (today ruins near S√°toralja√∫jhely). Historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs claimed that Peter's namesake great- grandfather (\\"Peter I\\") owned V√©cse (today Vojƒçice, Slovakia) by 1217 (while others argue it referred to a member of the Aba clan from the Tarj√°n branch). Accordingly, four generations bore the same forename in the upcoming decades. His son, Peter II (\\"the Freckled\\") bought Alb√©ny and Tehna with the permission of King B√©la IV in 1245. Sz≈±cs argued this was the first step in the development of the G√°lsz√©cs lordship (today Seƒçovce, Slovakia), the core of Peter, son of Petenye's dominion. These lands were part of the so-called \\"gyep≈±elve\\", a mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited area beyond the eastern border of the Kingdom of Hungary. Brekov (Bark√≥) Castle Peter, son of Petenye first appeared in contemporary authentic charters since 1283, during the reign of Ladislaus IV, although a false diploma already mentioned him in 1263. In that year (1283), Ladislaus IV donated him the so-called Veker's Gate near the Veker (today Krivo≈°≈•anka) Mountains, once an important part of the Hungarian border system in the eastern territories. Alongside Reynold B√°szt√©ly, former Palatine of Hungary and a certain James, he served as noble judge (; lit. \\"servants' judge\\") of Zempl√©n County sometimes after 1289 (some historians dated to around 1286 and 1291). He appeared in various lawsuits and land contracts in the 1290s. For instance, he protested against the induction of one of the applicants to the ownership of Visny√≥ (present-day Vi≈°≈àov, Slovakia) in 1296, before the court of Amadeus Aba. By 1297, Peter owned G√°lsz√©cs (or Sz√©cs), the territorial centre of his landholdings. The village of Sz≈ëll≈ëske also belonged to his property as an \\"inherited land\\" in 1298, in addition to an exchanged land, Zebegny≈ë (today Zbeh≈àov, Slovakia), acquiring from his relatives, a certain Matthias and his brothers, sons of Conrad. By 1308, when a charter referred to the lordship as \\"land beyond Terebes\\" (today Trebi≈°ov, Slovakia), he owned several villages and estates between the Bodrog and Tisza rivers (the region of Bodrogk√∂z), for instance Rozv√°gy, Salamon (today Solomonovo, Ukraine), Z√°hony, Kiszte, K√°s√≥ (today Kysta and Ka≈°ov in Slovakia, respectively). When Charles I confiscated Peter's lands in 1317, the G√°lsz√©cs lordship consisted of 18 villages. Possibly in the 1290s, Peter built the castle of Borosty√°n, which later became his provincial seat and 17 villages and lands belonged to it. Beside that, he also owned Jeszen≈ë Castle (today Jasenov, Slovakia) since 1283, after it was confiscated from the rebellious Joachim Gutkeled's family. In 1307, he acquired Bark√≥ Castle (today ruins above Brekov, Slovakia) from the Kaplon clan during an estate contract. Sometimes before 1312, he also became owner of the Bodrogsz√∂g Castle, which laid somewhere near present-day Klin nad Bodrogom, Slovakia. Lord of Zempl√©n Provincial lord Amadeus Aba and his kinship ruled de facto independently the northern and north-eastern counties, including Zempl√©n, of the kingdom since the 1290s, during the era of feudal anarchy. It is possible that Peter was among his familiares, thus he was able to maintain some degree of autonomy. After the extinction of the √Årp√°d dynasty in 1301, when a succession war broke out, Amadeus Aba supported Charles of Anjou's claim to the Hungarian throne, thus Peter also joined his camp. Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom by 1310. The burghers of Kassa (now Ko≈°ice in Slovakia) assassinated Amadeus Aba in September 1311. After that Charles was committed to eradicating the Abas' oligarchic rule. However, Amadeus' sons rebelled against the king and entered into an alliance with the powerful oligarch Matthew Cs√°k. Then Peter decided to left the Abas' allegiance and swore loyalty to Charles. In late 1311 or early 1312, when the Aba troops raided S√°rospatak, the fort was successfully defended by the own militia of Peter and members of the Baksa kindred. Peter was seriously injured in the clash. A royal charter issued on 10 April 1312 narrated that one of Amadeus' sons, Nicholas Aba took revenge on Peter for his defection, and his troops looted and devastated the G√°lsz√©cs lordship (possibly in the spring of 1312). During the skirmish, the local church was destroyed, where all accumulated wealth were plundered, causing the damage of 1,000 gold ducats for Peter. In addition, his manor was set on fire by the Abas, when Peter's unidentified wife stayed there, while one of his relatives, also a Peter, was killed. Following that Peter participated in the siege of S√°ros Castle (today ≈†ari≈° in Slovakia), when Charles' army seized the fort from the Aba-ally Z√≥lyom (Balassa) kinship. As a partial compensation, Peter was granted the land of Pihnye (present-day Pichne, Slovakia) from Charles I, who previously confiscated the estate from the treacherous sons of a certain Iroszl√≥ (Jaros≈Çaw). Reg√©c Castle Following the Battle of Rozgony on 15 June 1312, Peter and his servants presumably participated, which brought an end to the Aba family's rule in Northeast Hungary, Peter was made isp√°n of Zempl√©n and Ung counties by Charles I. As part of his dignities' honor, he was also granted the castles of G√∂nc (Amadeus Aba's former seat) and Reg√©c, where he served as castellan (with the title of comes). K√°d√°r questions the latter position. According to historian Gyula Krist√≥, Peter exploited that political vacuum, which emerged following the dissolution of the Abas' dominion in the upcoming years, and began to establish a de facto independent province in Zempl√©n and partly Aba√∫j counties. Thus Krist√≥ considered him as one of the so-called \\"oligarchs\\" or \\"provincial lords\\". Peter continually distanced himself from the royal power and entered as a local tyrant against the neighbouring noblemen. For instance, he plundered the lands of the royalist Nagymih√°lyis (descendants of the Kaplon kindred) in late 1315. He cooperated with his former enemies, the sons of the late Amadeus Aba, and their joint troops besieged and destroyed the castles of Gy√∂rke and Nagymih√°ly (today ƒéurkov and Michalovce in Slovakia, respectively). Peter's henchmen also tortured and murdered some of the Nagymih√°lyis' relatives and servants. Peter possessed approximately 50 villages and six castles by that time. In November 1316, it was reported the members of the Rozgonyi family (B√°szt√©ly clan) have been \\"defending Csicsva Castle [today part of Sedlisk√°, Slovakia] for almost a year\\" against Peter's banderium. Rebellion against Charles Peter, son of Petenye was first referred to as \\"disloyal\\" by Charles I on 2 January 1317. The royal charter reported James Borsa, a former Palatine of Hungary, who turned against Charles, had made an alliance against the king with other lords, including his son-in-law Mojs √Åkos, the Gutkeleds of Szil√°gys√°g (SƒÉlaj) and Peter himself in the second half of 1316. In the charter, Charles confiscated some of his lands and estates and handed them over to his loyal soldier Mikcs √Åkos, who suffered serious damages in his clashes against Peter (for instance, one of his familiares was killed). Among the lands confiscated were Sztracsina, K√©kmez≈ë, Nagydom√°sa, Kisdom√°sa and Gereginye (present-day Stroƒç√≠n, Kukov√°, Veƒæk√° Doma≈°a, Mal√° Doma≈°a and Ohradzany in Slovakia, respectively). Another document issued on 10 February 1321 narrated that after his betrayal, Peter, whose estates laid in the northeast border, traveled to the Kingdom of Rus' and offered the Hungarian crown to either Andrew or Leo II of Galicia, both were maternal great-grandchildren of B√©la IV of Hungary. Historian Attila B√°r√°ny argued James Borsa and the increasingly influential Mojs √Åkos supported Peter in his efforts, and he represented the whole conspiracy in the Galician royal court. Because of his potential Ruthenian ancestry and proximity to his properties, Peter had extensive and vibrant political and trade connections with the local elite in the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. Tam√°s K√°d√°r doubts the offer of the Hungarian throne, he considers that Peter and his allies only sought military assistance in Galicia against Charles. Peter's diplomatic mission ended unsuccessfully, both of the Rurikid princes, Andrew and Leo refused to involve in the unification of Charles, with whom they maintained good relationship (there were theories that Charles' first wife was Leo's daughter, Maria). Jasenov (Jeszen≈ë) Castle, owned by Peter since 1283 Based on a regesta found in the archives of the Drugeth family (today part of the Slovak National Archives in Pre≈°ov), Peter even attempted the assassination of Charles I twice. At first, he personally tried to kill Charles, who was sick in bed in S√°rospatak, possibly when he still was considered loyal, thus he was able to present the king's companion without difficulty. Peter's attempt was revealed and captured by the king himself. Istv√°n Petrovics considered this attempt took place in the last months of 1316. In contrast to Petrovics' reconstruction, Tam√°s K√°d√°r argues that Peter was considered loyal even on 15 December 1316, according to a royal document. In addition, Charles resided in Southern Hungary, Temesv√°r and Lippa (present-day Timi»ôoara and Lipova in Romania, respectively), in those months. If Peter's first assassination attempt happened at all, it must be occurred in the spring of 1317, as K√°d√°r considers. Gyula Krist√≥ questioned the validity of the royal document's narration on Peter's assassination attempt. The historian argued Charles I and his chancellery aimed to emphasize the impenitence of the traitorous Peter with the false narrative. Tam√°s K√°d√°r does not share this viewpoint; he considers, instead of Peter, his commissioned assassin was captured during the first attempt. For the second time, Peter hired two assassins to murder Charles, who resided in the temporary capital Temesv√°r then. According to a diploma from 1355, the assassins, certain noblemen Nicholas and Philip tried to kill the king with an arrow. There was no report that whether Charles was injured during the assassination attempt, but the king exiled them and confiscated their lands in Csan√°d County. Petrovics argued Peter's second attempt occurred in either Spring (during his war against Charles) or Winter 1317 (after his defeat in Zempl√©n). Charles immediately responded to the unfavorable developments and launched a multi- faceted war against James Borsa and his allies in early 1317. The king initiated a royal campaign first against Peter, the weakest member of the anti-Charles coalition. Philip Drugeth, who was also made isp√°n of Aba√∫j County, and Mikcs √Åkos led Charles' army against Peter's forts in Ung County in the first months of 1317. Around March, Drugeth captured G√∂nc, then his army marched in front of Reg√©c Castle, also joined by Ladislaus Baksa's auxiliary troops due to a threatening leaf by Drugeth. Reg√©c was besieged and seized in April. In the same time, Mikcs √Åkos crushed Peter's power in Zempl√©n, capturing the castles Bark√≥, Borosty√°n and Bodrogsz√∂g within few weeks. Peter successfully broke out of the blockade, \\"like an indomitable beast\\" (as a 1342 charter wrote) during the siege of his seat, Borosty√°n and fled the province. However, Mikcs captured and imprisoned Peter's (probably namesake) son and sent to the royal court as a prisoner of war. Peter's last stronghold Jeszen≈ë was taken by Philip Drugeth in the last days of April or early May 1317. Later life After his fall in Zempl√©n, Ung and Aba√∫j counties, there is only fragmented information about Peter. Following his defeat (or simultaneously), Charles turned against James Borsa, whose army was defeated in the first half of 1317 (historian Attila Zsoldos provided the exact date to 10 February) in Debrecen, and his fortresses were captured in the following months. James Borsa barricaded himself into the castle of S√≥lyomk≈ë (now in Ale»ôd, Romania), but was captured by the royal troops after his surrender (possibly in May 1318), however he escaped execution and was eventually ransomed by Mojs √Åkos. It is possible that Peter was captured too in S√≥lyomk≈ë or earlier (his involvement in the two assassination attempts revealed only then), and later himself was also released during a ransom or exchange of prisoners between the royal court and Mojs. In Transylvania, James Borsa and Peter, son of Petenye were both marginalized and overshadowed by Mojs, militarily the most successful enemy of Charles. When Mojs failed to prevent the king's general D√≥zsa Debreceni to advance into the inner parts of Transylvania at Topa, midway between the Meszes Gate and Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania) in July 1318, Peter, summoning his supporters in Szatm√°r County, also participated in the skirmish, along with James Borsa and others. Possibly he remained in Transylvania in his remaining years and continued to struggle against the local pro-Charles noblemen in the regions of Northern Transylvania, Upper Tisza and Szamos (Some»ô) after the withdrawal of D√≥zsa Debreceni. In February 1321, Charles recalled him with \\"cursed memory\\", confirming his death by then.

The Jinping Mountains, sometimes considered a large mountain massif, are approximately long and only wide. Geology The Jinping Mountains are part of a complicated orogenic complex from the Indian subcontinent's collision with the Eurasian Plate and the resistance of the Yangtze Plate to the east. The mountains are primarily composed of Triassic marble. Geography The Jinping Mountains are rugged and rise almost above the Yalong River on either side. The Jinping are located in the complicated grouping of mountains called the Hengduan Mountains that transition between the Tibetan Plateau in the northwest to the Yungui Plateau in the southeast. The Jinping are sometimes classified as a southern subrange of the Shaluli Mountains, a component range of the Hengduan. The Yalong River separates the Jinping Mountains from the Daxue Mountains to north. The tallest peak of the Jinping Mountains rises to above sea level and has a topographic prominence of . This peak is also known in Chinese as Jinping Shan (Èî¶Â±èÂ±±) as the word for mountain () can refer to either a mountain or mountain range. After flowing southeasterly, the Yalong River diverts north along the west side of the Jinping before turning 180 degrees and flowing south along the east side of the mountains. This forms the dramatic Jinping Bend, known for its deep gorge and inhospitable terrain. Human development The Jinping's vertical relief and the Yalong River's elevation drop from one side to the other make it an optimal source of hydroelectric energy. The Jinping-I Dam, on the west side of the Jinping Mountains, is the tallest dam in the world at high. The Jinping-II Dam, a little further downstream, diverts the water of the Yalong River nearly under the Jinping Mountains to the east side of the bend. More than 13.2 million m3 of earth was excavated for the construction of Jinping-II's power station below the mountains. A total of seven tunnels were bored through the Jinping Mountains at depths up to beneath the mountain peaks. This included four water diversion tunnels, two auxiliary tunnels, and one construction drainage tunnel. The China Jinping Underground Laboratory was developed along the southernmost Jinping-II tunnel through the Jinping Mountains. This institution specializes in the research of dark matter as the location deep below the surface of the earth shields the laboratory from interfering cosmic rays.

Structure  The church is built in the form of a Latin cross, and is decorated with large paintings made in 1954 by Alfonso Tentarelli according to the project of father Jean Lerario; there is a wooden statue of Mary with Jesus blessing child of the fifteenth century (unknown author) called \\"Madonna dello Splendore\\". On August 15, 1914, a golden silver crown, made by the Migliori family, was placed on the head of the Virgin. Around 1950, the statue was surrounded by rays, symbol of divine light, and placed above a tree to remember the olive tree in which it appeared in 1557. In the sacristy there is a remarkable painting of the Virgin and Child in glory with the saints Peter, Paul, Dorothy and Francis, of the sixteenth century, by Paul Veronese. The miraculous water was collected in a fountainLa Fonte Miracolosa della Madonna dello Splendore in the gardens of the convent, where a small temple was built with mosaics of the Old and New Testament. The reception area is dominated by a large bronze statue of Christ with the inscription \\"EGO SUM VIA VERITAS ET VITA\\" (I am the way, the truth and the life). History During the second half of the 16th century, there was a small chapel in Giulianova used by a confraternity devoted to the Virgin of the Rosary. In 1559, on near Giulianova, the Capuchins received a first donation from the Acquaviva family and built a church dedicated to st Michael the Archangel. The sanctuary was built on the site of an apparition of the Virgin on 22 April 1557. Between 1968 and 1971, the convent hosted a small seraphic seminary; restoration work was done between 1989 and 1992 around the \\"Fountain of the Virgin\\", and a votive temple was rebuilt. During the years 1990-2000 the up-side floors of the convent were renovated to accommodated the Splendor Art Museum, and the old place where the firewood was stored became the library of the convent. Along the Bertolino Street, a monumental bronze Via Crucis was erected by Ubaldo Ferretti. In 2001, the old organ was replaced by a new one, due to organ builder A. Girotta.

With the swing keel all the way up, the Corvette only draws 3'3\\" (1m), making it an excellent boat for shallow water areas. It has a very livable interior, but it is a little small when compared to later designs...

It has garnered a sizable following for its story, characters and atmosphere, particularly after its officially sanctioned fan translation into English. It is about an enigmatic humanoid entity known as the Batter, who is described as being on a \\"sacred mission\\" to \\"purify\\" the world of Off. The Batter travels through four bizarre Zones in the world, revealing more about the world as the game goes on.  Gameplay  boss named Sucre, alongside two of his Add-Ons. The gameplay of Off is similar to that of classic RPGs. The Batter advances by leveling up, acquiring new party members, and upgrading his statistics, such as attack and defense, as well as gaining special abilities termed \\"competences.\\" Unlike similar games that function in a turn based system, OFF uses a system in which a character is able to attack once a cooldown has passed, meaning enemies and players are able to attack each other at the same time. This system serves to encourage players to make fast decisions in combat. The player can allow combat to take place automatically by selecting the \\"Auto\\" option during encounters, which will make the Batter and his Add-Ons act without player input. The battle system also features an unorthodox element system, where rather than \\"classic\\" elements often found in RPGs, such as fire or ice, Off uses bizarre elements more commonly thought of as materials: smoke, metal, plastic, meat, and sugar. There are four numbered Zones, labeled 0‚Äì3, along with a fifth zone, The Room, in which the final act of the game takes place. The Zones are only accessible once the player obtains their associated \\"Zodiac-Cards,\\" which are acquired from the previous Zone's Guardian upon death, and the player traverses between them via a map termed the \\"nothingness.\\" One notable feature of Off is its unusual number of puzzles, which include finding a multi-digit password and entering it into a giant keypad, locating missing book pages, or \\"repeating room\\" puzzles where players walk through multiple instances of the same room in the right order to escape.  Plot  Gameplay screenshot of the original French version of Off, in which the Judge is explaining a block puzzle to the Batter. The player assumes control of the Batter, a man in a baseball uniform on a \\"sacred mission\\" to \\"purify the world\\". After receiving guidance from a talking cat called the Judge, the Batter begins to make his way through four Zones, killing malevolent ghost-like creatures called \\"spectres\\" and the Guardian of each Zone in order to \\"purify\\" the Zone. As the Batter progresses in his quest, it is ultimately revealed that the Zones are tied to the Guardians' life force and that killing the Guardians will annihilate all life in the Zones; this outcome is the Batter's true objective. The Batter eventually reaches an area called the Room and faces the Queen, ruler of all the Zones. She admonishes him for the destruction he has caused and attacks him, but is defeated. After killing the Queen, the Batter finds and kills Hugo, the child who brought him and the Queen into existence. The Batter then comes across a switch that will allow him to finish his mission, but is confronted by the Judge. The Judge berates both the Batter and the player for deceiving him and destroying the Zones and asks the player to help him to defeat the Batter. In the Official Ending, the player sides with the Batter and kills the Judge, allowing the Batter to flip the switch. Doing so displays, \\"The switch is now on OFF,\\" as the world fades to black. In the Special Ending, the player sides with the Judge and defeats the Batter to stop his crusade. The Judge remarks that \\"Hence nothing remains except for our regrets,\\" but prefers this outcome to the Batter completing his mission. During the Special Ending's credits, the Judge is seen walking alone through the purified Zones. A third Secret Ending can be accessed if the player collects the Aries-Card and plays through either of the normal endings. This joke ending revolves around so-called \\"Space Apes\\" in a war against brain-like aliens. The Space Apes describe their plan to construct factories in the now-lifeless world of Off to produce robots capable of killing the aliens.  Development  Georis lists Killer7, Final Fantasy, and Myst as inspirations for Off.  Reception  Off has been praised for its story, characters, and atmosphere. Heidi Kemps of PC Gamer described it as \\"a memorable and haunting RPG, filled with tricky puzzles, bizarre symbolism, and challenging thematic elements.\\" Adam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun compared it to Space Funeral. A large fanbase for the game developed on Tumblr; Off became the sixth most reblogged game of 2013, with the first five being AAA games. Off has been compared to the Mother series, though Georis has stated that the resemblance is coincidental.

Tiger was victorious when the Spanish ship surrendered after a severe bombardment.Marley (2008) p 116 Background In April 1585, English Admiral Richard Grenville was in charge of a seven-strong fleet that brought English settlers to establish a military colony on Roanoke Island. This had been founded by Sir Walter Raleigh, off the Western coast of North America (modern- day North Carolina).Quinn pp 85-86 War had already been declared by Philip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Elizabeth I had offered her support to the Protestant Dutch rebels. In August the 160-ton English ship Tiger or Tyger of twenty two guns (which had been converted into a galleass) under Grenville began her voyage back to England from the 1585 Roanoke Expedition.Kupperman pp 23-24 On 31 August 1585 the Tiger after only the seventh day of sail sighted a ship; upon closer inspection it turned out to be a Spanish ship, and eventually caught up with her.Bicheno pp 180-81 Battle Sir Richard Grenville The Spanish ship fired off a friendly salute, and as soon as the ship was in range, the Tiger opened fire.Miller p 104 The Spanish ship was the Santa Maria de San Vicente, the flagship of the Santo Domingo squadron of the Spanish Flota, captained by Alonzo de Cornieles. At near 400 tons Santa Maria de San Vicente was a richly-laden galleon having sailed from Havana with nearly 300 crew, soldiers, and passengers. She was struggling to catch up with the main convoy of thirty ships much farther ahead, having been forced to heave-to by gale-force winds. (Spanish) Grenville soon realised that the size of the Santa Maria de San Vicente was much larger (200 tons bigger) than his own ship. The Tiger sought to close and use her guns to pound the ship into submission rather than board, which was Grenville's initial strategy. Cannon fire from the Tiger soon found their target and sent shot firstly into the rigging of Santa Maria de San Vicente. She was hit by a number of broadsides from the Tiger, and a further shot holed her below the waterline. For three days the Santa Maria managed to put up with incessant attacks from Tiger but was unable to reply effectively as her guns were falling well short of the English vessel. Unable to tolerate the bombardment any more the Santa Maria de San Vicente turned around and attacked. She attempted to board, but the Tiger kept a good distance putting up stout resistance. The English ship, despite being outnumbered, was able to gain the upper hand by pounding the Spanish ship into submission.Canny pp 91-92 Tiger began to have some sustained damage, and the English decided to act. With crates and sheathing from the Tiger, English sailors created a raft and used it to assault the Spanish ship. Cornieles seeing that he was in a desperate situation having already been holed and suffered heavy damage, then surrendered. The twenty men on the makeshift raft sank just as they landed on board. The Spanish had suffered ten casualties in all, while the English had only two wounded. The Spanish prisoners were transferred to the Tiger, and the two ships travelled together, bound for England. Aftermath On the journey home both ships endured high seas and storms - the prisoners were dropped off at the Azores islands under oath. The Santa Maria de San Vicente was taken into Bideford amid much rejoicing. Grenville officially valued the prize at 15,000 pounds, making the voyage a large profit. The capture was vital for underlining Grenville and Raleigh‚Äôs case that colonization and exploration could be financed through privateering. Over 40,000 ducats worth of gold, silver, and pearls‚Äù along with cochineal, ginger, sugar, and ivory were discovered in the large hold. On the other hand, the Spanish estimated the value of the vessel at 50,000 pounds, and it was rumoured by some to have been worth as much as one million ducats. This spurred accusations against Grenville of embezzlement. Santa Maria was converted into a galleon known as the Galleon Dudley. Three years later both Tiger and the Galleon Dudley fought during the defeat of the Spanish armada.Powell p.14 Pedro Diaz, a pilot of the Santa Maria de San Vicente', was kept as a prisoner by the English, who brought him along on the 1586 Roanoke Voyage, of which he kept a detailed journal which proved useful in knowledge of that expedition. The cannons from Santa Maria de San Vicente were discovered by the quayside of Bideford in 1895. They were then placed in Bideford's Victoria Park only to be erroneously labelled 'Amada cannons'.

In addition to its naval role it was also employed in coastal artillery, railway gun and anti-aircraft roles. History The 76/45 began life as a French design from the Schneider company called the Canon de 76 mm Mod√®le 1911. The Italians bought a production license and the gun was produced by the Gio Ansaldo company. In service there were a number of designations such as the Cannone da 76/45 S 1911, 76/45 S Mod 1911 RM (Regia Marina) and Cannone da 76/45 CA (contre-aereo). During World War I Ansaldo produced 312 guns and 287 mounts in response to a request for anti-aircraft guns. These guns were emplaced on high angle pedestal mounts for static defense of high value targets and on armored trains of the Regia Marina. During the 1930s the 242 surviving guns were assigned to coastal artillery and anti-aircraft units of the MVSN. These remained in use together with 66/47, 76/40, 77/28, 100/47, 102/35 and 102/45 due to insufficient numbers of the newer Cannone da 75/46 and Cannone da 90/53 guns. Guns captured by the Germans after the Italian defeat were designated 7.62 cm Flak 266/3 (i). The most common anti-aircraft configuration was a fixed battery of four guns located near major cities, factories or military bases. Target range was measured by optical coincidence rangefinders and height by optical height finders. These coordinates were transmitted to a single fire-control station, which calculated target speed, altitude and direction to determine deflection angles. These calculations were then transmitted to each gun crew for barrage fire. Batteries also had associated searchlights and acoustic location devices.

Her book The Female Christian may have been the first written by a woman in defense of Universalism. Early years and education Lucy Barnes, eldest daughter of Rev. Thomas Barnes, was born in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, March 6, 1780. Her father was the first Universalist minister in Maine. When a child she was sweet in disposition, gentle in deportment, but very undemonstrative, unless an opportunity presented itself by which she could serve some one, or reconcile contending parties; \\"and then,\\" says the \\"Christian Intelligencer\\" of 1825, \\"she would wear a smile of complacency and satisfaction that was beautiful and heavenly.\\" Her opportunities for an education were very limited, but she was an omnivorous reader, and could repeat what she read as easily as most could repeat the chit-chat of an afternoon. Career When she was 19 years old, Barnes made a profession of religious creed. At about that time, her father removed to Poland, Maine, at which place a frantic \\"reformation\\" was going on. She attended the meetings, and gave all the arguments and all the warnings a most careful and respectful consideration; \\"for,\\" she said, \\"if their explanations are correct, and this singular work is sanctioned by divine authority, I am perfectly willing and ready to embrace Methodism.\\" She was always interested in religious discussions, and read the Bible with great interest, but at this time, she read verse by verse, and conscientiously considered the import of every word. The more she read, the more clearly she saw the fallacy of the popular explanations, and the more truthful seemed the doctrine that she ever after lived by, and at last died believing. As soon as it was known that Barnes had openly proclaimed that she could not put bounds to the love of God, and announced her belief in Universalist doctrine, crowds visited her for the purpose of either driving or persuading her from that belief. Barnes had a peculiar aptitude for logical reasoning, and presented her points so persuasively, and in so amiable and loving a manner, that the most intelligent became convinced that her \\"weapons were not carnal but mighty,\\" and were generous enough to say she was a \\"real Christian,\\" even if she had embraced the awful doctrine of universal salvation. She was constantly trying to impress upon the young the principles of morality, and their duty to live Christian lives. Soon after her death some of her letters, dissertations and poems were collected and printed in a pamphlet of 71 pages, entitled The Female Christian. In the \\"Gospel Banner,\\" of 1858, there was a review of the pamphlet by Rev. John Wesley Hanson, then editor. This may have been the first book written by a woman in defense of Universalism. He said,‚Äî\\"The passages from the letters, verse and prose of the fair, frail hand that has for fifty years been cold can not fail to be read with interest.\\" The \\"Christian Intelligencer,\\" of 1825, of Portland, Maine, publisher of her father's memoir states,‚Äî\\"Miss Barnes from infancy had in warm weather been sorely afflicted with asthma, but for several years before her death the complaint became more severe and alarming. Though the distress and pressure at the lungs were frequently so great that she seemed to be in the agonies of death, the first language she uttered would be intended to console and comfort her parents. Her individual hope in Christ, and her faith in the universal salvation, remained firm and unwavering to the last, and even in the dread struggles of expiring nature the smile of heavenly serenity was visible on her countenance, evincing a willingness to sleep in death, that she might rest in God.\\" With regard to her health, Barnes stated,‚Äî\\"It is very low indeed. I am not able to walk out of my room, nor to sit up but a few moments at a time, so that I have been many days in writing these lines; but although they are penned by a feeble hand, yet, through the grace of God, they proceed from a heart strong in faith, though on the verge of eternity.\\" A short quotation from the last written exhortation of Barnes, finished only the day before she died read,‚Äî\\"Let us, therefore, be humble, and endeavor to pursue the paths of peace, and to walk in the straight and narrow way. And whenever we discover any going on in vice and wickedness, and walking in the broad road in search of happiness, let us pity their weakness and folly, and mistaken ideas of bliss, and endeavor, if possible, to restore them in the spirit of meekness, \\"considering ourselves lest we also be tempted. For if we had their temptations, rue might perhaps do equally as bad or even worse than they. May every blessing attend you which can contribute in the least both to your temporal and spiritual welfare. May the God of peace be with you always; may you be patient in tribulation, remembering that whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth. and that these afflictions which are sent for our profit are but short, but the joys which will soon dawn upon us are of a duration.\\" It was said that though her style was not ornamented with the tinsel of rhetoric, it was enriched with the unstudied fervor, gravity, and resignation which would be requisite to a chapter of an inspired volume. She died August 29, 1809, at the age of 29.

Since 1980, the franchise has played in five Stanley Cup Finals, winning four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983. 1972‚Äì1974: The NHL heads to Long Island William Shea played a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island. With the impending start of the World Hockey Association (WHA) in the fall of 1972, the upstart league had plans to place its New York team, the Raiders, in Nassau County's brand-new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. County officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out. William Shea, who had helped bring the Major League Baseball's New York Mets to the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Shea found a receptive ear in NHL president Clarence Campbell but faced opposition from the New York Rangers, who didn't want additional competition in the New York area. Eventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners, Madison Square Garden, to reconsider. Rangers' president Bill Jennings realized that he had two choices. If he allowed another New York-based NHL team, he would at least be able to extract compensation from it for sharing the Rangers' NHL territory. In contrast, a WHA rival would not be obligated to pay the Rangers anything. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the New York Jets had played in ensuring the success of the American Football League just a few years earlier, Jennings ended up helping to bring a new NHL team into town. Despite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL hastily awarded a Long Island-based franchise to clothing manufacturer Roy Boe, owner of the American Basketball Association's New York Nets, on November 8, 1971. The terms of the franchise included $6 million ($ million in dollars) franchise fee plus a $5 million ($ million in dollars) territorial fee to the Rangers. An expansion franchise was also given to Atlanta (the Flames) to keep the schedule balanced. The franchise chose New York Islanders as its name, although many expected it to choose the \\"Long Island Ducks\\", the name used by a team that played in the Eastern Hockey League from 1959 to 1973.NHL Team Nicknames Explained The team was soon nicknamed the \\"Isles\\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the middle of their second season. On February 14, 1972, Bill Torrey, executive vice president of the NHL's California Golden Seals, was named as the team's general manager. The Islanders secured veteran forward Ed Westfall, Gerry Hart, and goaltender Billy Smith in the 1972 Expansion Draft, along with junior league stars Billy Harris, Lorne Henning, and Bobby Nystrom in the 1972 Amateur Draft. Soon after the draft, Phil Goyette was named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with Earl Ingarfield and assistant coach Aut Erickson. Unlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft; he stated, \\"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\\" Before the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain. Their first win came on October 12, 1972 in a 3‚Äì2 game against the Los Angeles Kings. In the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty that would win four straight Stanley Cups in the 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. However, the young and inexperienced expansion team posted a record of 12‚Äì60‚Äì6, setting an NHL record for number of losses and worst overall record in a season. A rare highlight occurred on January 18 when they defeated the defending Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins 9‚Äì7. Finishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the 1973 draft. Off the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then unprecedented 11 million dollars in franchise and territorial fees. Montreal Canadiens' general manager Sam Pollock was keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could bring French Canadian junior star defenseman Denis Potvin, who had been touted as \\"the next Bobby Orr\\" when he was 14 years old, to Montreal. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick. During the off-season, Torrey convinced former St. Louis Blues coach Al Arbour to come coach the Islanders. Even with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the East Division that season, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973, which also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season. 1974‚Äì1979: Ascendancy and playoff inability Hall of Fame defenseman Denis Potvin led the Islanders to their postseason success in the '70s and '80s. With the fourth and twenty- second picks in the 1974 draft, the Islanders added young forwards Clark Gillies and Bryan Trottier to continue Torrey's building plan. In 1975, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and Glenn \\"Chico\\" Resch, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival New York Rangers in a best-of-3 first-round series as J. P. Parise scored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game. In the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series winning Game 7 on a late third period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the 1941‚Äì42 Toronto Maple Leafs, Major League Baseball's 2004 Boston Red Sox, the 2009‚Äì10 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 2013‚Äì14 Los Angeles Kings). They were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3‚Äì0 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers before the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again. Despite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \\"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\\" The Islanders continued their climb up the standings in 1975‚Äì76, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league. It was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence. Rookie center Trottier finished the season scoring 95 points and winning the Calder Memorial Trophy; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie. It would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history. Despite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In 1976 and 1977, the Islanders were knocked out in the semi-finals by eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens posted a 24‚Äì3 record in the playoffs during those two years with all three losses coming from the Islanders. Mike Bossy was selected with the 15th overall pick in 1977 and became the third Islander to win the Calder Memorial Trophy in his first season. In the 1977 draft, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards Mike Bossy and Dwight Foster. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality, while Foster could check and had led the Ontario Hockey League in scoring. Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check. In the upcoming 1977‚Äì78 season, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, having scored 53 goals that season, the most scored by a rookie at the time. The team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships. Six players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them being players drafted by the Islanders, showing the success of the draft building process. The season ended with a familiar result as the team lost in the overtime during playoffs Game 7 of the quarterfinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs; Billy Harris failed on a breakaway which was followed by Lanny McDonald scoring to complete an upset. In 1978‚Äì79, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the seasons final game against the Rangers. Trottier was voted the league MVP and captured the scoring title, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semi-finals. As the team was leaving Madison Square Garden following their Game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After surrendering the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts. Off the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both the Islanders and the Nets even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an American Basketball Association power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10 million they had paid in startup costs, and the expenses associated with moving the Nets to the National Basketball Association threw Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners, John Pickett, who assigned Torrey as team president. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative cable contract with the fledgling SportsChannel network as their owner, Charles Dolan, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended to not only keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as MSG Plus, for over a quarter-century. 1980‚Äì1983: The Dynasty After the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In 1980, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the Stanley Cup. Before the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman Dave Lewis to the Los Angeles Kings for second line center Butch Goring. Goring's arrival is often called the \\"final piece of the puzzle\\": a strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and Clark Gillies. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers Duane Sutter and Anders Kallur and stay-at-home defensemen Dave Langevin, Gord Lane, and Ken Morrow (the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the 1980 Olympics), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success. Bryan Trottier won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the team's Most Valuable Player for their run in the 1979‚Äì80 playoffs In the semi- finals, the Islanders faced the Buffalo Sabres, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2‚Äì1 victory in game two on Bob Nystrom's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the Philadelphia Flyers, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25‚Äì0‚Äì10) during the regular season. In game one in Philadelphia, the Islanders won 4‚Äì3 on Denis Potvin's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3‚Äì2, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4‚Äì2 lead in the third period but Bob Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup. This was the most recent Stanley Cup clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings pulled it off in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win a Stanley Cup (in 1980) with Europeans (Stefan Persson, Anders Kallur) on its roster. The Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored 50 goals in 50 games in 1981 and the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the Minnesota North Stars in five games to win the Stanley Cup. Butch Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semi-final sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \\"1940!\\" ‚Äì referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in (the Rangers would not win the cup again until 1994). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant. These four banners hang in Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum and represent the four Stanley Cup championships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983. In 1981‚Äì82 the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while Mike Bossy set a scoring record for right wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders won the regular-season title, yet once in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins they found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before John Tonelli scored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the upstart Quebec Nordiques and the Cinderella story Vancouver Canucks in the first ever coast-to-coast Stanley Cup Final for their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from Tiger Williams and falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. The next year, although the Islanders had won three straight Stanley Cups, more attention was being paid to the upstart Edmonton Oilers, whose young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records. The 1982‚Äì83 season was thus a battle to decide which was the best team in the NHL. The Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the Stanley Cup finals to win their fourth straight championship. Billy Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of the Playoffs after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series. The Sutter brothers, Duane and Brent, scored 7 and 5 points respectively in the first 3 games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup. 1984‚Äì1991: Post-dynasty and the Easter Epic The Islanders finished the 1983‚Äì84 regular season tied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \\"Drive for Five\\" got off to a tense start. With 39 seconds remaining of the deciding game of the opening round against the Rangers they gave up the tying goal to Don Maloney that the Islanders felt was illegal because Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the Washington Capitals in five games and the Montreal Canadiens in six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie Pat LaFontaine scoring two third period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cups in seven years. For the 1984 postseason, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home ice advantage in the series based on winning a regular season game against the Oilers, despite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series. The Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19 series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959‚Äì67 streak by the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association). Unlike the 1976‚Äì79 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons. The Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the 1984‚Äì85 NHL season, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the 1985‚Äì86 and 1986‚Äì87 seasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, who eliminated the Islanders in the Patrick Division Finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Washington Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978. Kelly Hrudey (pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \\"Easter Epic\\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play. In 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury and Clark Gillies was picked up on waivers by the Buffalo Sabres. Arbour retired as coach following the 1985‚Äì86 season and was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach Terry Simpson. During the first round of the 1987 playoffs against the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7. The Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \\"Easter Epic\\". Kelly Hrudey stopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime‚Äîand at 1:56 a.m. on Easter Sunday morning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75‚Äì52. They were eliminated in the Patrick Division finals in seven games by the Flyers. Chronic back pain forced Mike Bossy to retire after the season. The following season, the Islanders captured another division title, but were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart New Jersey Devils. Potvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by Ray Bourque and Paul Coffey. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out. The 1988‚Äì89 season saw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the Quebec Nordiques for the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned over day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal, Stephen Walsh, and Paul Greenwood. In return, they each bought a 2.5 interest in the team. In the next season, the Islanders rebounded to get back in the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of Bryan Trottier's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The 1990‚Äì91 season had the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games. 1991‚Äì1995: New faces and the miracle of 1993 LaFontaine, the Islanders' remaining superstar, was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before 1991‚Äì92. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine, Randy Wood and Randy Hillier (along with future considerations) to the Buffalo Sabres in return for Pierre Turgeon, Benoit Hogue, Uwe Krupp and Dave McLlwain. He also sent longtime captain Brent Sutter and Brad Lauer to the Chicago Blackhawks for Steve Thomas and Adam Creighton. With these additions and a talented core of players such as Derek King, Ray Ferraro, and Patrick Flatley, along with incoming Soviet players Vladimir Malakhov and Darius Kasparaitis, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early '90s. However, the management committee was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager Don Maloney was hired in Torrey's place, while Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion Florida Panthers. In Maloney's first year, 1992‚Äì93, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in six years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the Lady Byng Trophy. Ray Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning Game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, suffered a shoulder separation when Dale Hunter checked him from behind as he celebrated a series-clinching goal. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer. He returned only for spot power play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a then-record 21-game suspension. The Islanders' next opponent, the Pittsburgh Penguins, were twice- defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, and Ron Francis. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of Newsday, Long Island's hometown newspaper, predicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs. However, on the strength of outstanding goaltending from Glenn Healy and contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when David Volek scored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game. Newsday's front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \\"It's a Miracle!\\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015‚Äì16 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the Wales Conference Finals against the Montreal Canadiens, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard- fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup. Maloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the 1993 Expansion Draft he traded backup goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick to the Quebec Nordiques for Ron Hextall. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the Expansion Draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, then was claimed by the Tampa Bay Lightning in Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he was the backup. The Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant Lorne Henning. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for Tommy Soderstrom in September. In the lockout-shortened 1994‚Äì95 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year Ottawa Senators. 1995‚Äì2000: Management issues By the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the Montreal Canadiens for Kirk Muller and Mathieu Schneider, while Hogue was sent to Toronto for young goaltender Eric Fichaud. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well. Before the 1995‚Äì96 season, Maloney fired Henning and named Mike Milbury head coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker- clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \\"fishsticks\\"‚Äîmocking how the logo resembled the Gorton's Fisherman. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22‚Äì50‚Äì10. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall, and gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the following season and elevated assistant Rick Bowness to the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the 1997‚Äì98 season. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the following season while retaining his job as general manager. During the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss. In July, Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525 or $750) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, Big Shot. Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials. Initially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan McCabe were traded for veteran Trevor Linden. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997‚Äì98 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer Zigmund Palffy, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year Bryan Berard, and rugged defenseman Rich Pilon. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the National Football League's Washington Redskins and Cleveland Browns. 2000‚Äì2006: New ownership and a return to the playoffs In 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to Computer Associates executives Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar. The sale cost $187.5 million ($ million in dollars) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around. The new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players Roberto Luongo and Olli Jokinen to the Florida Panthers for Oleg Kvasha and Mark Parrish. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took Rick DiPietro with the first selection in the 2000 draft, ahead of consensus picks Dany Heatley and Marian Gaborik. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \\"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\\" Establishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \\"Mad Mike\\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was only ahead of only that of the franchise's first season. The team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player Butch Goring. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring Ted Nolan as Goring's successor; Instead, Boston Bruins assistant coach Peter Laviolette was hired. The Islanders acquired Alexei Yashin (left) prior to the 2001‚Äì02 season. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years. Three key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001‚Äì02 season, Laviolette's first. Alexei Yashin was acquired from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Bill Muckalt, defenseman Zdeno Chara and the Islanders' second overall pick in the 2001 draft. Next, Islanders prospects Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt were traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Michael Peca, who became the team's captain. By virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season, Detroit Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood was the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange. The additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turn-around in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed Billy Smith's previous record of 65. During the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs. The Islanders lost in a very physical first round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, Game 5 featured Gary Roberts charging Islander defenseman Kenny Jonsson, and Darcy Tucker submarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's anterior cruciate ligament, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injury Peca before the game has even began, which Tucker denied. Despite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the 2002‚Äì03 season. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded Ottawa Senators. Milbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing post-season interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach. He was replaced with Steve Stirling, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. In the following season, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning. Following the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for following season. Peca was traded to the Edmonton Oilers for center Mike York, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap. The same day, the team signed winger Miroslav Satan to play alongside Yashin. Milbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding Alexei Zhitnik, Brad Lukowich and Brent Sopel to replace the departed Adrian Aucoin and Roman Hamrlik, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the HockeyAllsvenskan in Sweden. In the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain. The team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season. 2006‚Äì2009: Management shake-ups and the Rick DiPietro contract On the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found. He served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007. Wang proceeded by hiring Neil Smith as general manager and Ted Nolan as head coach, following a brief stint by Brad Shaw as the team's interim head coach. Smith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender Garth Snow, who retired from his playing career to accept the position. Before his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen Brendan Witt and Tom Poti, and forwards Mike Sillinger and Chris Simon. On September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5 million ($ million in dollars) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for National Basketball Association player Magic Johnson. DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \\"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\\" As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta Thrashers' general manager Don Waddell felt that, \\"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\\" The new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings. Eyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward Ryan Smyth from the Edmonton Oilers at the trade deadline on February 27, 2007. Injuries to DiPietro and a distracting stick swinging incident that resulted in Simon's suspension for the rest of the season provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention. They qualified for the post-season, assisted by a late-season winning steak and a 3‚Äì2 shootout victory against the New Jersey Devils in their final regular season game. Despite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the Presidents' Trophy-winning Buffalo Sabres. Bill Guerin was the New York Islanders' captain from 2007 through mid-2009. Management announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain Alexei Yashin's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it. Free agents Smyth, Poti, Viktor Kozlov, Jason Blake, and Richard Zednik also left in July 2007. During that month, the Islanders signed Bill Guerin to a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy. Also in the off- season, free agents Mike Comrie, Andy Sutton and Jon Sim joined the team. That summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500. Arbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3‚Äì2, raising his career coaching win total to 740. The team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they resigned Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and Marc-Andre Bergeron. A rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season. At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center Josh Bailey. They also added free agents Mark Streit and Doug Weight. The team dismissed head coach Ted Nolan over alleged philosophy differences, and later that summer replaced him with Scott Gordon. Near the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and Chris Campoli to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Dean McAmmond and the San Jose Sharks' first-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and sent captain Bill Guerin to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a conditional draft pick. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26‚Äì47‚Äì9, which was the team's worst record since the 2000‚Äì01 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. 2009‚Äì2015: The John Tavares era begins John Tavares, former captain of the Islanders who left in free agency Beginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected John Tavares with the first- overall pick of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Tavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports, and it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares, Victor Hedman, and Matt Duchene. NHL Central Scouting Bureau's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \\"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\\" They traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman Calvin de Haan with the 12th overall pick, as well as Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee in later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the 2014‚Äì15 season. The 2009‚Äì10 season started out slow, with the team winless its first six games. The team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential postseason contenders. The team hit a mid-season hot streak, however nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back. They ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league. The placement led to a fifth overall pick in 2010. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards Nino Niederreiter and Brock Nelson with picks five and 30, respectively. As the 2010‚Äì11 season got underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach Scott Gordon. He was replaced on an interim basis by Jack Capuano, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Early in the season, they also acquired Michael Grabner from waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy; he would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season. This year also featured the infamous Penguins‚ÄìIslanders brawl, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \\"failure to control their players\\". The following season was a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists, in addition to being selected to play in the 59th NHL All-Star Game at the age of 21; his 81 points were seventh-best in the league. Tavares' left-winger Matt Moulson also had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points. Despite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34-37-11, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts. They used the first round of the 2012 draft to select defenseman Griffin Reinhart with the fourth overall pick. On August 1, 2011, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called The Lighthouse Project, which would renovate the arena. In the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, new arenas in Queens or Suffolk County, the Sprint Center in Kansas City, or the Videotron Centre in Quebec City, the last of which is coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015. On October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise will indeed be moving to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the 2015‚Äì16 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move. As part of the deal, the management of the Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to the Barclays Center. The decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and Queens. Beginning on April 1, 2013, of the 2012‚Äì13 season, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the Philadelphia Flyers later that month. During that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4‚Äì3 shootout loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, ending a six-year playoff drought. Behind goaltender Evgeni Nabakov, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the playoffs, continuing their winless streak in playoff series. On September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011. After posting a 4‚Äì4‚Äì3 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Thomas Vanek, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer. Despite chemistry with linemates Tavares and Kyle Okposo, however, the overall lack of on-ice success and his desire to test free agency led to Vanek being dealt to the Montreal Canadiens at the trade deadline for Sebastian Collberg and a second-round pick in 2014. After a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a record of 34‚Äì37‚Äì11. In the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their final season at Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to Jaroslav Halak from the Washington Capitals in exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed Mikhail Grabovski, Nikolai Kulemin and goaltender Chad Johnson as free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired Johnny Boychuk from the Boston Bruins for two-second round picks in 2014 and 2015 and a conditional third round pick in 2015, as well as Nick Leddy from the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for prospect Ville Pokka, T. J. Brennan and the rights to Anders Nilsson. The NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen Jon Ledecky and Scott D. Malkin in October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who will retain a share of the franchise. The Islanders finished the 2014‚Äì15 regular season with a record of 47‚Äì28‚Äì7 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 2015 playoffs. The Capitals held home ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the Columbus Blue Jackets, 5‚Äì4, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2‚Äì1‚Äì1 record in the season series. On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2‚Äì1. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, Game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles' Cal Clutterbuck scored the final NHL goal in the building. 2015‚Äìpresent: Move to Barclays Center and playoff series win Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the home of the Islanders since 2015 In June 2015, the Islanders selected forward Andong Song in the 6th round of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team. The Islanders played their first regular season game at Barclays Center on October 9, 2015, losing 3‚Äì2 in overtime to the Chicago Blackhawks. Artem Anisimov scored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman Travis Hamonic, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the Florida Panthers; goaltender Thomas Greiss only played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the San Jose Sharks prior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up Alan Quine scored the game- winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3‚Äì2 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1‚Äì0 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games. Summer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the Buffalo Sabres, Detroit Red Wings, and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. Snow signed free agents Andrew Ladd from the Winnipeg Jets and Jason Chimera from the Washington Capitals to help fill the gaps left behind. After an underwhelming first half of the 2016‚Äì17 season, posting a 17‚Äì17‚Äì8 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager Doug Weight being named interim head coach. Having coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993. Prior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up Jean-Francois Berube after Halak posted a 6‚Äì8‚Äì5 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016‚Äì17 season. In late January 2017, following a report by Bloomberg News which speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue has been mixed, and the Islanders have had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league), Newsday reported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum. Despite winning their last six games of the 2016‚Äì17 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season. In the 2018‚Äì2019 season, the Islanders hired Lou Lamoriello as their GM, Barry Trotz as their coach and named Anders Lee as their captain. They ended the season with 103 points (3 more than Toronto) and swept the Penguins in the first round of the playoffs (then swept by Hurricanes). In the summer of 2019 the Islanders broke ground to build an amazing new arena at Belmont Park.

Chants Some fan chants that Islanders fans have been doing over the years include, \\"YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!\\", done each time after the Islanders score a goal. The YES chant was started by The Blue and Orange Army during the '13-'14 season and slowly grew to be a part of team history chanted by thousands of people.

He was co-founder of the Gundi Windi cattle and sheep run which later evolved into the town of Goondiwindi. He was appointed to the Native Police in 1850 and became Commandant of the force in 1855. He retired from the Native Police in 1856 and held various Justice of the Peace and police magistrate roles in Goondiwindi until his death in 1872. Early life Richard Purvis Marshall was born in Hatherleigh, Devon, England in 1818. His father was Lieutenant Sampson B. Marshall of the Royal Navy and his mother was Mary Ann King. Sampson Marshall served on the navy ship Diadem during the War of 1812 and was severely wounded at the Battle of Baltimore in 1814. He received a pension and was retired from service. The Marshall family emigrated to New South Wales on the David Scott, arriving in Sydney in 1834, although it appears Richard remained in England until a later date. Sampson Marshall received a land grant of 640 acres at Jerry's Plains in the Hunter Valley and later moved his family to Rosebrook near Maitland in 1840. Gundi Windi In the late 1840s Richard Purvis Marshall in partnership with his brother Sampson Yeoval Marshall established the Gundi Windi pastoral station on the MacIntyre River along the northern frontier of the colony of New South Wales. This area straddled indigenous Bigambul and Gamilarai territory and armed opposition to British colonisation was fierce. Other new runs in the region faced similar resistance and conflict resulted in numerous deaths on either side. The invading armed British settlers augmented with constables under the command of Commissioner Richard John Bligh from Warialda were unable to defeat the Aboriginals and as result some squatting leases were abandoned. Augustus Morris, who held the Callandoon lease adjoining Gundi Windi was also a politician in the colonial New South Wales government. He recognised the need for a strong paramilitary force to enforce British control in the MacIntyre River region and recommended legislation to set up a Native Police to be deployed in the area. In 1848, funds were set aside by the New South Wales government for this purpose and by mid 1849, fourteen aboriginal troopers from the Deniliquin region in the south of the colony were sent to the MacIntyre under the command of Frederick Walker. This force rapidly extinguished Aboriginal resistance in the region in a number of skirmishes including those at Carbucky, Beeboo and along the Severn River, where the indigenous groups \\"suffered so severely\\" in their defeats. When Frederick Walker and his troopers were to leave to patrol and pacify the Condamine River region to the north, the settlers of the MacIntyre, including Richard Purvis Marshall, wrote a letter to the government demanding a continuation of the protection given by the Native Police in their area. Lieutenant in the Native Police With the expansion of the Native Police, Richard Purvis Marshall was appointed on 5 January 1850 as Lieutenant of the 1st Division. He was in command of 10 troopers to patrol the MacIntyre and Condamine regions. Almost immediately, Commandant Walker left on a recruiting drive in the southern districts leaving Marshall as highest-ranking officer of the force in the area. Marshall directed a number of punitive expeditions and summary executions against aboriginal people in 1850 including the execution of \\"Nobody\\" and the shootings at Wallann station. Further missions resulted in aboriginals being killed at Booranga and there was a large \\"dispersal\\" at Copranoranbilla lagoon, where Marshall divided his troopers along each side to entrap an indigenous camp. In 1851, Marshall's 1st Division was deployed to the Burnett and Wide Bay regions where missions extended across a number of pastoral stations including Toomcul, Widgee and Rawbelle. At the end of this year, the report on the activities of Marshall's division was sent to Governor Fitzroy which invoked the response that \\"a great many blacks are reported as having been killed by the Police..these acts of severity..have been unavoidable.\\" Commandant of the Native Police Marshall was appointed acting Commandant in mid 1854 after the suspension of Frederick Walker. He was officially appointed Commandant in 1855, but due to complaining about poor funding of the force he was dismissed soon after. However, Marshall was allowed to continue as an unpaid officer in the Native Police until early 1856. Magistrate roles in Goondiwindi After leaving the Native Police, Marshall held various Justice of the Peace and regular police magistrate roles in the Goondiwindi locality. He and his brother sold out of the Gundi Windi station in 1870. Death and Legacy Richard Purvis Marshall died on 15 August 1872 at his home \\"Corcoran\\" in Goondiwindi due to a chronic urinary tract infection. He was interred on the property. Marshall married twice and had several children. The main street in Goondiwindi, Marshall St, is named after him and his brothers.

Currently, in addition to a function as a place of worship for Muslims, this two-story mosque is also used as a means of religious education for the surrounding community.  History  There is no definitive data on when the mosque stood. However, local community estimates the mosque may be built almost simultaneously with nearby shophouses, built in 1921. The mosque initially did not have a dome, appearing more like a church building. Therefore local people then changed the shape of the roof by attaching the dome. Although rumor has it that the building is a former church, this is not the case given the direction of mihrab in this mosque is following the direction of Qibla. Since its establishment, this mosque was renovated once. The mosque measured 6 √ó 6 meters when first established, then in the 1980s, there was an overhaul for expansion of the area to 12 √ó 20 meters. To maintain its historical value, the renovation ensured the building is made the same as the original form, with milestones, walls, , and towers preserved.

The documentary also covers free speech controversies occasioned when political conservatives are invited to speak in university settings. The film was released in Arizona theaters on October 25, 2019, and was successful enough to have a national release on December 6, 2019. It has received mixed reviews from critics. Content With production beginning in 2017, the filmmakers were on hand for commentator Ben Shapiro's September 14, 2017, speech at the University of California, Berkeley, a site of civic protests and unrest. The film focuses on such speech disruptions in America, but also examines similar incidents in Canada with Jordan Peterson. In particular, it shows the case of Lindsay Shepherd who was disciplined at Wilfrid Laurier University for using a recording of a debate with Peterson in class. It also \\"denounce[s] censorship in China\\". \\"Carolla said, 'We'd be hypocrites if we did a movie about the suppression of free speech but didn't mention China.'\\" In a scene filmed at the Laugh Factory, comedians complain that audiences on college campuses are too easily offended now. Among these comedians are Adam Carolla with Karith Foster, Tim Allen, Andrew Schulz, and Bryan Callen. The film discusses the story of Bret Weinstein, a biology professor at the Evergreen State College in Washington state, who resigned after he was criticized for attending the university during a \\"Day of Absence\\" that was a long-standing tradition during which ethnic minorities would voluntarily stay home from campus to highlight their contributions to the college. Weinstein had objected to a change made that year to the event, which asked white participants to attend off-campus programs for the day. Weinstein and his wife, a fellow professor, resigned citing hostility relating to their refusal to participate in the Day of Absence. According to the Washington Examiner, the filmmakers worked to include \\"left-leaning\\" views in their movie. CNN's Van Jones complains that too many young people have not learned how to defend their views. Attorney Alan Dershowitz criticizes many college leaders and \\"the hard left\\" for not standing up for free speech. Commentator Dave Rubin argues that liberals should also fear \\"the mob\\". The film shows former U.S. President Barack Obama saying \\"Anybody who comes to speak to you ... you shouldn't silence them.\\" In dramatized scenes, Griffin Kramer portrays the young Adam Carolla, and Joseph Servin portrays the young Dennis Prager. Also in the film are Sharyl Attkisson, Candace Owens, Ann Coulter, and Cornel West. The film ends with a post-credits scene. The filmmakers have disputed its PG-13 rating. Reception Critical response No Safe Spaces has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 47%, based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.35/10. Metacritic reports a 31 out of 100 score, based on five reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Many critics panned the film as biased. For The A.V. Club, Vadim Rizov gave the film an F, summing up, \\"This isn't an argument for free speech, it's just paranoid whining, complete with a roundtable of comics sympathetically agreeing how sad and scary this all is, plus images of the Statue of Liberty with tape over its mouth.\\" John Wenzel of The Denver Post gave the film two stars and noted \\"Frequently, the film asserts that words have power ‚Äî why else would you want to make sure colleges are hosting conservative speakers? ‚Äî but then hedges the assertion by saying people are too readily offended these days. Which is it?\\" The Los Angeles Times review also panned it as one-sided and \\"disappointing agitprop\\". Some critics reviewed the movie positively. Alan Ng of Film Threat gave the film a 90 and wrote in his review, \\"When it‚Äôs all said and done, this film is offensive only to those who don't want to watch it.\\" Varietys Owen Gleiberman praised the movie's defense of free speech, stating \\"the most head-turning point made by No Safe Spaces is that today's anti-free-speech radicals, who on many college campuses dominate the discourse, are going to be tomorrow's leaders.\\" Box office As of March 2020, the movie had taken in $1.3 million at the box office. On its opening night, the film earned an estimated $45,000 on one screen in Phoenix, the production team said, adding that the only documentary that earned more from one screen on an opening weekend was Michael Moore's Sicko in 2007. The per-screen average was $3,542. No Safe Spaces, which opened in limited release on October 25, 2019, came close to topping Terminator: Dark Fate in Denver and San Diego theater complexes over the weekend, and ended up finishing a close second to the Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster in those venues after final figures came in. After its theatrical release, Salem Media Group made the film available as a video on demand. This is the first time Salem distributed a film. Prager criticized Netflix for rejecting the film, but paying $10 million for Knock Down the House, which did not have a theatrical release.

The series' creators came up with Wishfart during a lunchtime conversation when Dan Williams pitched an idea for a live-action series about a rich man in green who used his wealth to make people's wishes come true. The idea was soon developed into a children's animated series about a non-traditional leprechaun. The creators had little experience with animation, but managed to successfully pitch their idea directly to Teletoon without any sample artwork, thanks to the support of international distributor and producing partner, Tatiana Kober. The first season was produced for $7.4 million US. Slap Happy Cartoons did the character designs, with the creators' aim being for rounded shapes and thin outlines. Episodes  Broadcast  Wishfart made its worldwide broadcast debut on CITV on September 5, 2017.

It was incorporated in Texas in 1972 and was the first group in the Church in the United States to represent Spanish-speaking women. Las Hermanas has worked for the improvement of the lives of religious Hispanic women and their communities. They are outspoken critics of sexism in the Church and their communities. Las Hermanas is very political and has taken part in protests and other civil rights actions. The organization is currently considered to be on \\"hiatus,\\" with plans to continue their work in the future.  About  While Spanish speaking nuns made up a significant minority of nuns in the United States, they were the last group of women to form a coalition in the Church. Las Hermanas was formed to \\"develop cultural pride among their people.\\" In this way, they could be agents of political change by advocating for other Hispanic Americans. One of the founders, Gloria Gallardo, said that Spanish-speaking nuns needed to advocate on behalf of their communities because only they best understood their needs. In addition, the organization fought against sexism in the church. They promoted the idea that sexism was an \\"aberration\\" and a sin. The group also lobbied for women's ordination. Other early goals for Las Hermanas was to help improve the lives of nuns who worked for men as cooks and maids in rectories and seminaries in the United States. Many Mexican nuns were sent to the United States because they were seen as \\"cheap labor\\" for the Church. Las Hermanas also advocated on issues like childcare, violence against women, education and poverty. The organization has also marched for farmworkers' rights. Members of Las Hermanas originally included only nuns, but later admitted lay women of many different Spanish speaking backgrounds. Las Hermanas has partnered with other organizations to reach their goals, such as Padres Asociados para Derechos Religiosos, Educativos y Sociales (PADRES). The group has had an influential effect on the National Conference of Catholic Bishops/United States Catholic Conference (NCCB/USCC), the LCWR and the Secretariat for Hispanic Affairs of the United States Catholic Conference. Las Hermanas worked with women's groups to help support the organization; many religious women helped support Las Hermanas through donations. Las Hermanas published a quarterly newsletter called Informes. Las Hermanas is recognized as an \\"official\\" Catholic organization, but is autonomous of the Church.  History  Sisters Gloria Gallardo and Gregoria Ortega were the founding members in 1970 in Houston. Gallardo and Ortega were brought together by a friend of Ortega's, Father Edmundo Rodriguez. The two nuns started the group by soliciting Mexican-American women's names from bishops around the United States and also from the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR). From this list, they invited women to come to Houston in April 1971. The invitation, sent out in October, called on women to come together \\"not just for strength and support, but to educate ourselves as to who we are, where we're going, and how.\\" At the time, Gallardo worked in the office of community relations for the Galveston-Houston diocese. Around fifty Mexican-American women came to the first meeting, all of them had joined Catholic religious life just after Vatican II or prior to the conference. Many of them shared the experience of having to deny their cultural heritage after taking vows. The nuns represented eight different states: Arizona, Colorado, California, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Missouri and Texas, with one delegate from Monterrey, Mexico. At this meeting, which lasted over three days, they decided on the name of the organization and the motto. \\"Las Hermanas\\" means \\"the sisters\\" in Spanish. The motto chosen for the organization was \\"unidas en acci√≥n y oraci√≥n‚Äù (united in action and prayer). The choice to put \\"action\\" before \\"prayer\\" was a deliberate choice by the nuns. The sisters elected Gallardo to serve as the first president. Nuns at the April 1971 meeting chose to pursue as their immediate goals to \\"affect social change and to teach congregations, largely led by Anglos, about the needs of Spanish-speaking communities.\\" Nuns who were European-American in this group either did not return for the next meeting or became associate members; the group was meant to focus on developing leadership and opportunities for Hispanic women. Within six months, the group had grown to around 900 nuns. On September 19, 1971, the first issue of their newsletter, Informes, which was edited by Gallardo, was sent out. The next meeting was planned for November 1971 in Santa Fe, where 900 nuns of Hispanic heritage attended. Women from Puerto Rico and Cuba attended this conference. The November Santa Fe meeting resulted in an agreement to create teams which would target Spanish-speaking Catholics and help raise the awareness of community issues facing Hispanics. They also decided on a constitution for the group. The charter for the organization was granted by the state of Texas on February 22, 1972. Also in 1972, Gallardo resigned from the leadership team. Las Hermanas moved their headquarters from Houston to San Antonio and adopted a form of team leadership. The three women who began leading the organization were Sisters Maria de Jesus Ybarra, Mario Barron and Carmelita Espinoza. Also in 1973, the national meeting was split with half the sisters who were going to attend going instead to Fresno to protest the treatment of farmworkers. By 1975, lay women could join the organization. At the seventh conference in 1977, Las Hermanas decided they would develop a strategy to promote women's concerns at the Second National Encuentro of Hispanic Catholics which was happening later that year. In 1978, sisters from Las Hermanas were \\"prominent\\" speakers at the 1978 national conference on women's ordination. In 1985, the group testified on the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' Pastoral Letter on Women. During the testimony, Sisters Beatriz Diaz-Taveras, Maria Teresa Garza, Ada Mar√≠a Isasi-D√≠az and Carmen Villegas testified about Hispanic women's oppression in the Church, in their families and in broader society. In the early 1990s the group relocated to the campus of Our Lady of the Lake University. By 1991, there were around 1,000 members of Las Hermanas. Around this time, however, due to leadership being over-extended, the group began to decline.  Legacy  Las Hermanas has helped spread Latina theology not just in the Catholic Church, but through other Christian churches in the United States. The way in which Las Hermanas approached spirituality, theology, politics and feminism led to the creation of mujerista theology. Early members of Las Hermanas, Yolanda Tarango and Ada Mar√≠a Isasi-D√≠az, first wrote about mujerista theology in their book, Hispanic Women: Prophetic Voice in the Church (1988). A book about Las Hermanas, Las Hermanas: Chicana/Latina Religious-Political Activism in the U.S. Catholic Church (2004) was written by Lara Medina. Medina used interviews with women involved with the group to describe the history of the organization. Papers and archives for Las Hermanas are held at Our Lady of the Lake University's Sueltenfuss Library. The Mexican American Catholic College (MACC) was created in 1972 through a partnership with Las Hermanas, PADRES, the Texas Catholic Conference and the Archdiocese of San Antonio. Father Juan Romero stated that MACC \\"considered Las Hermanas and PADRES as co-founders\\" of the school.

It and its associated road are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the only remnants of the extinct settlement of Kelly's Ferry.  History  Kelly's Ferry Cemetery dates to the 1830s when a ferry was established across the Tennessee River by John Kelly. Shortly thereafter, a small community developed at the location. The ferry served as an important route across the river, and allowed goods to be off-loaded and transported by land to Chattanooga, thereby avoiding a treacherous stretch of the river upstream called \\"The Suck.\\" The road leaving Kelly's Ferry led to Wauhatchie Junction, which became an important railroad junction on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. Kelly's Ferry played an important role in the Cherokee removal from eastern Tennessee. During this event, Chattanooga served as a collection and holding point, from which groups of Cherokee were marched westward on the Trail of Tears. The road to Kelly's Ferry and the ferry itself were one of only a few paths suitable for transportation of large groups of people and supplies, and the historical record shows several Cherokee detachments camped or traveled through there. Artifacts found at the site of Kelly's Ferry. Kelly's Ferry and its road also served as an important transportation route in the Civil War. During the Confederate siege of Chattanooga, a garrison of soldiers was stationed there to secure the crossing. The site was later occupied by the Union army, and was an important link in the famous \\"Cracker Line,\\" the supply route established by General Ulysses Grant to break the siege. At this time, the road from Kelly's ferry was widened and improved by the Union forces to facilitate the movement of supplies. Kelly's Ferry gradually declined in the early 20th century, and closed in 1952. Kelly's Ferry Cemetery contains burials of many of the early settlers of the area, including John Kelly. Its earliest known burial dates to 1838. The site remains relatively intact, with little development in the area near the property.

Although the anterior subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint is the most common manifestation of the disorder, subluxation can also occur with posterior or vertical movement, and subaxial (below C2) joints can also be involved.  Signs and symptoms  Atlantoaxial instability is a common asymptomatic finding in rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, it can lead to cervical myelopathy. Patients with atlantoaxial instability can experience neck pain and headaches in the back of the head (occipital headaches). Myelopathic symptoms include: weakness, gait disturbance, paresthesias, and loss of dexterity (e.g. difficulty buttoning clothing).  Causes  The inflammatory mediators of RA including cytokines, growth factors, metalloproteinases destroy articular cartilage, subchondral bone, tendons and ligaments. Destructive synovitis leads to bone erosion and causes the ligaments of the spine to become too laxed (loose), eventually resulting in cervical spinal instability (loose neck bones).  Diagnosis   Physical exam  On palpation, the examiner may find crepitus at the neck joint and unstable movement including a positive \\"clunk test\\" (palpable subluxation). Lhermitte's sign may be elicited with head flexion.  Imaging  As many as 50% of people with radiographic instability are actually asymptomatic. Initial radiography should include flexion and extension lateral X-rays in addition to static anterior/posterior and lateral views. These views are often repeated every 2‚Äì3 years, especially in patients with new symptoms or possibly requiring future intubation. Progression of disease is measured via anterior atlantodental interval (AADI), and posterior atlantodental interval (PADI). Other techniques include the Ranawat Index, MacGregor Line, the Clark stations, and the Redlund-Johnell measurement.  Management  Up to 10% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at risk of sudden death due to unrecognized cord compression. Thus surgical intervention is a reasonable choice in the presence of a neurologic deficit as a result of instability.

It was transferred to the genus Sarcodontia by Czech mycologist Franti≈°ek Kotlaba in 1953. S. crocea usually occurs on old fruit trees, in which it causes a white rot. It is found in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is red-listed in several European countries. Fresh fruit bodies of S. crocea have an intense, fruity odour resembling pineapple or grated apples. The furan-derived compounds 4-(furan-3-yl)benzaldehyde and 4-(5-oxotetrahydrofuran-3-yl)benzaldehyde have been identified as contributing to this odour.

This suicidal endeavor not only precludes the hazards of orbital space debris and planetary contamination, but also provides the opportunity in some cases for terminal science given that the transient light released by the kinetic energy may be available for spectroscopy; the physical ejecta remains in place for further study. Even after soft landings had been mastered, NASA used crash landings to test whether Moon craters contained ice by crashing space probes into craters and testing the debris that got thrown out.Philips, T. (n.d.). Crash Landing on the Moon - NASA Science. Retrieved April 20, 2016, from https://science.nasa.gov/science- news/science-at-nasa/2006/28jul_crashlanding/ Several rocket stages utilized during the Apollo space program were deliberately crashed on the Moon to aid seismic research, and four of the ascent stages of Apollo Lunar Modules were deliberately crashed onto the Moon after they had fulfilled their function. The Deep Impact mission had its own purpose-built impactor which hit Comet 9P/Tempel 1. Terminal approaches to gas giants which resulted in the destruction of the space probe count as crash landings for the purposes of this article. The crash landing sites themselves are of interest to space archeology. Luna 1, not itself a lunar orbiter, was the first spacecraft designed as an impactor. It failed to hit the Moon in 1959, however, thus inadvertently becoming the first man-made object to leave geocentric orbit and enter a heliocentric orbit, where it remains to this day.

Early life  Manzoni was born in Paris, France, on May 15, 1961. He immigrated to Canada in 1978. He graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1981 from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Montr√©al and he earned an MBA in 1986 from McGill University in Montreal. In 1993 he graduated with a Doctorate in Business Administration from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in Boston.  Career  He spent 12 years on INSEAD Business School's Fontainebleau campus in France (1992‚Äì2004) during which he founded and directed the PwC Research Initiative on High Performance Organizations. He spent seven years at the IMD business school (2004‚Äì2010), where he served as Professor of Leadership and Organizational Development and directed IMD‚Äôs Breakthrough Program for Senior Executives. He taught 5 years on INSEAD Business School's Singapore campus (2011‚Äì2016) during which he directed the school‚Äôs Global Leadership Centre. Manzoni assumed the role of president of IMD business school on 1 January 2017. Manzoni has co-authored several books and more than 30 business case studies on how leaders can create a high performance work environment reshaping management culture and unlearning bad practice. Four of his case studies were recognised in the Case of the Year Awards by the European Foundation for Management Development and the European Case centre. Manzoni has written several articles in the Harvard Business Review and Financial Times. He is the author of The Set-Up to Fail Syndrome: How Good Managers Cause Great People to Fail, which he co authored with Jean- Louis Barsoux. The book expands on an similarly themed article in The Harvard Business Review in which the authors explored how managers‚Äô behavior might contribute to employees poor performance. In an interview with BBC, Manzoni explained how employees also contribute to their own unsatisfactory relationships with their superiors. Manzoni cautioned that attaching labels like demanding or overbearing can ultimately become a self-fulfilling prophecy. \\"The moment you label someone as difficult you‚Äôve just made them more difficult to work with because you‚Äôre not going to give this person the benefit of the doubt anymore and you‚Äôre not going to relate with them on a productive level.\\" Manzoni was invited to speak at the 2014 and 2016 World Economic Forum meetings in Davos. Manzoni is a member of the Human Capital Leadership Institute‚Äôs International Advisory Panel, Digital Switzerland, Singapore‚Äôs Public Service Division and the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

She is also known for her time in WWE, where she wrestled on the NXT brand under the ring name Taynara Conti. Early life Conti holds a black belt in judo and a blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. She participated in trials for the Brazilian Olympic team at the 2016 Summer Olympics prior to joining WWE. Conti began in the artistic gymnastics in CR Vasco da Gama, but soon migrated to the martial arts. First, Conti fought for the project \\"Brasil vale ouro\\" (Brazil is worth gold) and later went to \\"Instituto Rea√ß√£o\\", by judoka Fl√°vio Canto. Conti was a regional champion and four-time state champion. In addition, she was a four-time Brazilian runner-up. She joined the Brazilian team and participated in the European circuit in Portugal and Germany. Professional wrestling career WWE (2016‚Äì2020) Conti was announced as having signed with WWE, and reported to the WWE Performance Center in October 2016. She made her professional wrestling debut at WrestleMania Axxess in Orlando, Florida on April 1, 2017, competing against Sarah Bridges in a losing effort. She took part in the inaugural Mae Young Classic, during which she lost to Lacey Evans during the first round of the tournament. Conti appeared on television on the October 11 episode of NXT, interfering in a triple threat match between Nikki Cross, Peyton Royce, and Liv Morgan on behalf of The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, and Kyle O'Reilly) to prevent Cross from winning the match. This led to a match between Conti and Cross on the November 1 episode of NXT, where Conti lost. On April 8, 2018, Conti made her WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania 34, competing in the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal, becoming the first female Brazilian to compete at WrestleMania.

On April 20, 2020, Conti was released from her WWE contract as a result of budget cuts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like all other talent released, she remained under the 90-day no compete clause, which expired on July 23, 2020. All Elite Wrestling (2020‚Äìpresent) In August 2020, Conti appeared for All Elite Wrestling (AEW), participating in the AEW Women's Tag Team Cup Tournament: The Deadly Draw and teaming with Anna Jay.

History  Game designer Monte Cook left Wizards of the Coast in April 2001, founding Malhavoc Press as a d20 System imprint in May 2001. In July 2001 Cook signed with White Wolf's Sword & Sorcery Studios, at that time the largest independent publisher of d20 material, so that they could handle publishing matters while he focused on game design and writing. The company's first product was The Book of Eldritch Might (2001). This was the first commercial book published exclusively as a PDF that was released by a print publisher. It was an immediate success and has been credited with demonstrating the viability of PDF publishing within the role-playing industry. This and other early Malhavoc products were initially released only in electronic format through the Malhavoc site, though print versions of most of them were subsequently released by Sword & Sorcery. Malhavoc worked with Fiery Dragon Productions after the latter left Sword & Sorcery in 2002, and the majority of Fiery Dragon's licenses were taken from Malhavoc. In 2001 Malhavoc won the ENnie Award for Best Official Website,http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=1344 and in 2003 for Best Publisher. While the company was successful, Monte Cook announced in August 2008 that he had originally moved on from Wizards of the Coast primarily to write fiction, rather than design and release RPG products, and that \\"there are other areas I'd like to explore creatively\\". As such, \\"Malhavoc Press and virtually all game-related work\\" on Cook's part was put \\"on the back-burner\\" at that time, though he stated that he was not closing the press and left open the possibility of releasing future work under the Malhavoc name, should he later desire (which did happen). August 2008 also saw the sale of Malhavoc's publisher, Sword & Sorcery Studios, by its owner, White Wolf. Malhavoc was never formally closed, but has not released any new product since 2009; Cook formed a new publishing company‚ÄîMonte Cook Games‚Äîin 2012.  Malhavoc Releases  Most releases were written by Monte Cook, but other authors (such as Bruce Cordell, Sean K.

However, this was contingent upon legislation that needed to pass. Cuomo came to an agreement with the legislature in 2013 to allow the casinos to operate, and then sought to locate three sites for the upstate casinos. The casino's location was subject to a battery of lawsuits from 2015 to the time of its construction. There were concerns over competing interests with the Finger Lakes casinos, racinos, and the casinos operated by the Oneida Indian Nation. The casino opened on February 1, 2017.

His relationship with Lord Yuan is not clear. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, he became the lord of Wey nine years before Qin's unification of China. If the records were correct, his year of accession was 230 BCE. In the first year of his rule, he relocated the state of Wey and its people to Yewang; Today's Qinyang. After Qin's unification, Wey was the only remaining state out of all the Chinese states established according to the mandate of Zhou dynasty king excluding Qin. For reasons unknown, Qin Shihuang did not remove Jiao from his throne. In 209 BCE, Emperor Qin Er Shi deposed lord Jiao and made him a commoner. No further records were found in relation to lord Jiao after his deposition.

Early life and education  Diamond was born in Boston in 1967 and raised in Needham, Massachusetts. He attended Tufts University (1986-1990), where he majored in history and English. He obtained his PhD in history from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 2004 with a doctoral dissertation entitled \\"Hoodlums, Rebels, and Vice lords: Street Gangs, Youth Subcultures, and Race in Chicago, 1919-1968.\\" His doctoral research earned him a fellowship from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation.  Career  Diamond began his academic career in France in 2002 as a lecturer in American civilization at the Universit√© de Picardie ‚Äì Jules Verne and then moved on to the Universit√© de Lille 3 in 2005, where he worked as an Assistant Professor until 2010. Between 2010 and 2012, Diamond was a full research fellow at the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches Internationales (CERI) at Sciences Po - Paris, where he also taught a number of classes between 2007 and 2012. In 2012, he obtained his current position at the Sorbonne. Diamond has been a member of the editorial boards of the Revue fran√ßaise d'√©tudes am√©ricaines and The Sixties: A Journal of History, Politics and Culture, and served on the Board of Directors of the Urban History Association and the Fulbright Commission in France. He has been a featured speaker for the African Regional Services of the United States Department of State, the United States Embassy in Paris, and the Consulate General of France in Chicago. He worked with the Institut Fran√ßais of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as curator of \\"City/Cit√©: A Transatlantic Exchange,\\" a program of international conferences that brings together researchers, artists, policymakers, and activists from the United States and France to engage in a dialogue about the current state of urban democracy and of the circumstances arrayed against the realization of democratic ideals. He has written extensively and appeared regularly in both the French and American mainstream media on issues of race and inequality in France and the United States.  Works  He is the author or co-author of a number of articles and books on the history of politics, race and political culture. His first monograph, Mean Streets: Chicago Youths and the Everyday Struggle for Empowerment in the Multiracial City, 1908-1969, provides a comprehensive history of Chicago's youth subcultures and street gangs and their connection to racial identity formation and grassroots racial politics. The book was reviewed favorably in numerous scholarly journals and by the Chicago press. Historian Perry Duis praised it as \\"an enormously important book for historians in several fields,\\" and the Chicago Reader called it \\"a fascinating and revealing narrative.\\" His most recent monograph, Chicago on the Make: Power and Inequality in a Modern City explores the \\"link between race and neoliberalization at Chicago's grassroots over the 20th century\\". The book was awarded the Jon Gjerde Prize for the best book in Midwestern history in 2017 and the Illinois State Historical Society's Award of Superior Achievement, and was featured in the New York Times. Chicago on the Make has been lauded by a number of commentators for its hard-hitting analysis of the Chicago success story and the politicians who have rallied around it. Longtime Chicago anti-racist punk band Race Traitor referred to it as a \\"full take down of the neoliberal politics of Chicago,\\" and the Chicago Review asserted that \\"no one seems to come out unscathed from Diamond‚Äô s historical overview, and finishing the book, regardless of political orientation or preference, leaves one with the feeling of having just unfurled a scroll coated in an uncomfortable film of grease.\\"  Major publications  Diamond, Andrew J. and Thomas J.
